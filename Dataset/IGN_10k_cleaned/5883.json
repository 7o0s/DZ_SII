I recently downloaded Need for Speed Underground 2 on to my LG VX8000 -- a 3D-enabled handset -- with intense interest. Would EA have to sacrifice much for the trek? Or would this play as true companion piece to the bestselling console game?   Needless to say, the presentation blew me away. EA Mobile has done some things here that a few other publishers have promised, but have yet to deliver. Need for Speed Underground 2 features extensive voice clips, rendered cinematics, and course fly-bys. The opening movie tracks your character's trip via airplane to Bayview City where he plans to make his name on the street racing circuit. It is accompanied by an excellent sounding voiceover that is easily heard and understood.   And the voice work doesn't end there. Rival racers challenge you with short clips. And it's not the same clip over and over. I wondered why the game took forever to download -- probably because of the video and voice. Before races, the camera would scream down the city streets, showing off the impressive real estate that EA Mobile has crafted for this go-go edition of Bayview City. The skyscrapers are loaded with neon and signage. The road looks like it was been freshly watered for maximum effect.   The visuals are truly expert. Your car is exceptionally tight, with a smart polygonal model that looks like it has real weight to it. Thanks to the rear view it's hard to see if the wheels are spinning, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were. The side decals, the after-market add-ons -- everything is noticeable. The game employs a blurring effect to create a sense of speed that isn't really happening -- and sometimes it works. (Sometimes it looks like framerate is jittery, too.) I wouldn't go so far as to say Need for Speed Underground 2 on the 8000 beats out the DS edition of the same game, but there is no doubt the DS version can it in the rear view mirror.   Also quite impressive is that EA Trax has been ported to handsets. The game will store none of the music on your handset unless you tell it to, and then you can customize which tracks you want to download into your phone's memory. These take up a bit of room, so it pays to be choosy. But when you play the game and you hear quality audio -- even if some of the songs are suspect, such as the musical abortion performed by Snoop Dogg and the Doors --    So, what's the catch? There has to be a trade-off for all of this, yes?   I wish there wasn't, but there is. Need for Speed Underground 2 has load times. Lots of load times. It seems every time you turn around or want an extra feature, the game has to load something. Some of the load times are quick, others are painfully slow -- especially if you aren't on a flat-rate data plan, watching Need for Speed Underground 2 hit the network to download game assets is unnerving. This makes Need for Speed Underground 2 probably not the best game for quickshot mobile gamers, as some races take a minute to download, thirty seconds for the intro, a few minutes to play, and then a minute or so to wrap-up. If you have an extended bus ride, you could get in a game, perhaps. But if you have a couple minutes between class, Need for Speed Underground 2 is better left alone until later.   I suppose there is another catch that's more directly game-related, too: control. Need for Speed Underground 2 is a 3D game that has to be controlled by an archaic thumbpad or the number buttons. Sometimes, turning corners doesn't require finesse; it requires Mother Theresa's forgiveness. And while that isn't necessarily EA's fault -- they didn't design the phones -- maybe this hiccup could and should have been considered along the way. Because when your in a hard-earned first place, only to slam into the wall because your finger either slips from the low and slick-surfaced thumbpad or you have trouble hitting those number keys, not all the cinematics in Los Angeles will soothe your frustration.   The amount of game inside Need for Speed Underground 2 is remarkable. There is a lot of racing inside this little game as you drive around Bayview hooking up with rivals to enter racing events. A lot of the racing is fairly straightforward, as you jockey for first place in a relatively small field of opponents. Still, these races can get furious when all of the cars bunch up. You may find yourself squeezed out on a turn. There are other racing events, though, such as sprints. The variety of events is nice to see, even if they aren't as fun as the regular circuit races.   When you download the game, though, take a moment just to drive around before entering events. Get a handle on your wheels. Stop by the garage to marvel at the licensed cars. When you win races, you earn cash that can be used at the garage to buy better rides. You can also return to the garage and repaint your car from time to time, or visit body and performance shops to trick out the thing. There game is absolutely packed with features that you just wouldn't expect to find in a mobile game.   But just steel yourself for all of the loading.  What Need for Speed Underground 2 represents to me is not so much the next-generation in cellphone games, but the first real splitting-off of mobile game design philosophies. Right now, a good deal of mobile makers are concentrating on delivering bite-sized content. With Need for Speed Underground 2, EA Mobile is saying that it believes there is both room for multiple philosphies and an audience for console-esque gaming on top handsets. They may be right. Need for Speed Underground 2 is a big step for mobile gaming, in my opinion. While there are things I did not like about the game -- loading and some control issues -- I cannot deny that this is one hell of a package. If you want a game that maxes out your 3D handset, Need for Speed Underground 2 is the game to get. You will make your friends jealous with this one. As their pockets bulge with GBAs, DS's, and PSPs, you have a reasonable console game sitting right on your handset. The paradigm hasn't been shifted, but it's been sufficiently nudged.", "date": "Jul 14, 2005"}
