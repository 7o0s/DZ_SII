{"name": "Darkened Skye", "name_review": "Darkened Skye", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/14/darkened-skye", "text": "Using his own dark, tainted prism, the evil overlord Necroth diverted the magical Skittle dispersing rainbows of the land into his own hellish lair -- the boy likes Skittles. In efforts to restore all that is good and fruity to the now Troubled Lands, our heroine Skye (the girl with the past) along with newfound friend, Draak the gargoyle, will venture forth and try and bring some color back into the sky. Wow, the title of the game works in so many ways.  Darkened Skye is a third-person action adventure not all that dissimilar in nature from F.A.K.K. 2, Heretic II, or even Alice. But unlike those games, (the upper echelons of the genre), Darkened Skye doesn't feature much the way of exciting gameplay, groundbreaking visuals, or intense, relentless action. What it does offer is a lighthearted, comical foray into a genre traditionally overwhelmed with dark, brooding, or overtly serious efforts. No underlying meat and potatoes accompany this candy, but as any self-respecting kid will tell you, sugar alone can sometimes be enough.  Skittles this and Skittles that. I've heard quite a few pompous games editors arbitrarily disregard Darkened Skye as rubbish without even so much as an initial play. ~Skittles game? Whatever... It sucks.~ It should be awfully obvious to a lot of you by now, but in case you've missed it, other people are idiots (and I'm talking everyone, baby). These same fools would probably initially rate the exact same game a 9 without playing it if id, Valve, or Epic were tacked on as developers, so don't pay any attention to them and their casual, arbitrary discounting of otherwise good products. Read the reviews (they generally dictate that a person has thoroughly played the game at hand, generally) and open your mind to the possibility that it need not be obscenely violent, juvenile, or portrayed in slow-mo to be good. You have to play a game before you can bury it. You can't write off Typing of the Dead as trash without at least trying it, just as you can't ~The Skittles game.~  So the basis for the alternate universe of Darkened Skye, which happens to be medieval fantasy, by the by, comes from the ~Taste the Rainbow~ series of Skittles commercials (wizard collecting Skittles in hat, etc.).  The little mutli-colored fruity delights make appearances in the game as vessels of magic. They fall from rainbows, make everyone giddy, spread joy throughout the land, and miraculously never manage to pollute the oceans of the world. But like I said earlier, a grubby bad dark overlord has stolen these rainbows and their Skittles for their magical properties (you know he's just microwaving them to see what happens). Blah, blah, blah... Skye embarks to stop him... Blah, blah, blah... Action happens... Yadda, yadda... Mysterious past... Good vs. evil... Find old man from commercials to conspire to overthrow dark overlord... Etcetera, etcetera. Yeah, it's all well and good.   Where Darkened Skye manages to excel (and greatly, mind you) is in the delivery of this somewhat perfunctory storyline. First of all, just think of the Skittles themselves as magic orbs, crystals, gems, or Cheetos -- it really doesn't mean a God damned thing. They're mystical, colored spheres like everything else of importance in videogaming since the dawn of time (or the late 70s, whatever). So get that out of your head right now. Simon & Schuster could have replaced the Skittles with mini-Joan Rivers' and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference, except they'd be a lot scarier and the game would probably have something to do with zombies and being unwelcome wherever you go. Anyway, that's besides the point, Skye takes an absurd premise, crafts, and then delivers it into an experience that is truly enjoyable to watch. If it were a television show with a decent budget, it'd be good.  Superb acting and writing are the primary causes of this. Actual Hollywood talent has been imported to convey a welcome, lighthearted, and pleasant story. A flip through the back of the instructtion manual led me to Linda Larkin as Skye. Not quite the movie aficionado I perhaps should be, I required a quick trip to the IMDB to discover that she in fact played Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin. Unlike franchise actors who breeze through a videogame recording session in twenty minutes with as much feeling as a metronome, it's abundantly clear that all of the actors in Darkened Skye (Linda included) flexed their professionalism and took the job seriously (quality and effort are unmistakable).  Acting is all well and good, but without a good script from which to draw, there won't be much to deliver regardless of how well you deliver it. Thankfully, Skye provides. The title has a very Buffy-esque charm and quality to it: a quirky, not taking evil seriously, goofy kind of presentation. Skye herself is very likable, sarcastic, witty, and adorable. She rarely takes herself or her surroundings seriously, and, when used in conjunction with her well-traveled guide Draak, delivers some truly witty repartee that's a parody on conventional games and other laughable stereotypes of pop-culture... ~There's no telling what could be in there... Better stick my face in.~   The piece on the terror pit is also hysterical. But, depending on how staunch and unwavering of a gamer you are (I can already see a nightmare of endless seas of empty Jolt Cola cans, poor, unattended posture that has long since led to camel humps and inward shoulders, and a lot of bunny hopping, rocket throwers in Quake) you may not ever break a giggle or move past a light chuckle while playing Darkened Skye. But if you have any kind of a heart or soul, smiles will certainly be plentiful.      The problem...here it comes...is that gameplay and other required criteria for a complete product are either underdeveloped or very poorly implemented.    You have to jump around way too damn much, and all while in very unforgiving circumstances. Miss your mark and you'll be drowning, falling to your death, or quickly meeting any number of other untimely ends. Stiff animation, poor collision detection, and spotty landings don't serve to help the situation any. It's nice that with this many instances of carelessly leaping from place-to-place they thought ahead to grant players full control of Skye even while in flight (no inertia here), but no O.G. Prince of Persia mantling or stick-landings makes for a very trying, loose and clumsy experience.   I also question the responsiveness of Skye's vertical motion. Because a lot of the terrain is ever so slightly sloped, she'll miss a step and not go airborne when directed. This gets really, really annoying and leads to hundreds of needless deaths. Enter the quick-load. God bless the PC and whoever came up with the idea of quick-saving and quick-loading. Moreover, God bless whoever developed these functionalities in Darkened Skye, because they are nearly instantaneous (so fast in fact that the music doesn't even skip a beat). It's awesome, to be sure, but not totally redeeming.  Combat is very standard: shoot at stuff from afar and bash things that get close (a button for magic, a button for melee). Different combinations of the different Skittles can be placed in specific places in an inventory screen to expand your spell casting abilities, leading to an appreciably high number of possible spell combinations to choose from (some of which have very specific, scripted uses), and you can even do a few different kinds of melee strikes and special melee strikes that are related to attack and movement combinations. Still, play never escalates past these very basic levels... Enemies run at you, surprise you from behind corners, lurk in impossibly small ponds, and get killed when they show their ugly faces. After this, you walk around and push buttons. To spice things up, there are those occasions when you'll have to do contend with enemies, buttons, and perilous jumps all at the same time! Ooh... Time for a little F2 quick-saving action. Puzzles comprise the remainder of the experience and vary widely, from the simplistic, to the illogical, to the mundane, to the cool (don't expect Project Eden to relinquish its throne anytime soon).  Unlike its dialog and acting, Darkened Skye isn't a particularly beautiful graphical feat. The draw distance is far too close for what little detail the game pushes, environments are bland and drably colored, and textures can't begin to compete with those found in nearly any of today's higher-end efforts. Its aesthetics are on par with titles from several years ago (early Quake 2 powered ones probably even able to oust DS in some direct comparisons). To the game's credit, it runs at about a million frames per second, Skye herself is acceptably detailed (though laxly animated), and plenty of personality and individuality has been lovingly included into many of the game's distinct characters. Some of the more important ones are almost, but not quite at Soul Reaver's technical levels.   A similar degree of suffering mediocrity comes from aural departments. Ironically, despite the stellar voicing, Darkened Skye features appropriately flutey, lutey, but redundant squire music and mediocre sound effects. I never wept or flailed my arms in frustration and anger (at least not more so than I normally do), but I won't ever be playing this stuff in my car unless it's to scare criminals from a house as part of psychological warfare. The comments section is new to IGNPC (those scrub cousins of ours over at the console channels have been using it for some time now). I'm not really keen on compressing my entire article into a couple of paragraphs when I normally reserve this space at the end of an article for childish banter, potty mouthing, and the solicitation of relationships, but I digress...Darkened Skye is a solid, but never markedly above average outing in the genre. Titles now a year or two old can easily offer up better graphics, better sound, and better gameplay. However, Darkened Skye's charm, personality, and lovable nature are irresistible, especially when  seen alongside so many other ostentatious titles of sickeningly profound seriousness. Irresistible for sure, but not exalting enough to overcome substandard play mechanics and aesthetics. It may not be the best title abound, but I'd ask that you overlook the brand-naming and at the very least give it a try so that to better appreciate and pay respects to the efforts being made in the fields of videogame writing and acting.I'd have liked to like it more, but Skittles in the day and Skittles in the night without any real sustenance is enough fuel to only drive a brief novelty.", "date": "Feb 14, 2002"}
