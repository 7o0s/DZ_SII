With Gallop Racer 2004, Tecmo is going with the latter idea. While all of the gameplay from the previous entries in the series is intact, with a few additions as well, there's little to entice new gamers to try out this horse racing simulation. As it stands, this title is an update for the loyal fans of the series and will give them plenty of enjoyment as everyone else scratches their heads.   Like its predecessors, Gallop Racer 4 is serious about being a horse racing simulation in terms of the deep, deep, deep amount of stats involved with each and every horse as well as the jockeys riding them. The interface features Technicolor menus and characters that look like they stepped right off the greens of Hot Shots Golf Fore! with their huge heads and wacky facial expressions, but don't let that fool you at all because this game is serious about the sport.   In the career mode, gamers create their own jockey and must rise up through the ranks of the racing world by earning a reputation by riding well in the races that are available. At first, the only horses that can be ridden are the ones that owners will allow you to ride and that requires some faith on their part. For the owners to let you on their horse, you need to build up your stats by earning points from racing victories. Eventually, players will get a stable of horses of their own that they can race, breed, and retire if they get too old. By monitoring the different horses and learning how to ride them on the tracks it's possible to make a name for one's self.    The actual racing itself may look like there's a lot going on, but in reality the interaction between man and virtual horse is pretty minimal. The horse will run along automatically and there are only three things to worry about: speeding up or down, moving left or right, and whipping the horse. It's important to resist the urge to tap the d-pad furiously since every change in direction will require just a couple taps. Get too excited and the horse will surely tire itself out and defeat is guaranteed. An entire race can be run with less than 10 taps on the d-pad for the entire time.   What is important in the race are the three crucial phases of the start, positioning for the majority of the race, and the spurt or final dash to the finish. While the start is obviously important, the most strategic element here is the positioning. Different horses run better in different parts of the pack with some performing better in the front while others like to be in the middle or even at the tail end. By keeping one's horse in the optimal location in the pack the horse's stamina will build up during the race and that energy is crucial for the spurt at the end.      By developing enough energy in the pack, racers can use this with some good timing to power through the closing stretch of the race and nab a first-place finish. As a new incentive for getting the three phases of the game off with skill there are three icons in the HUD that can change as if they were on a slot machine. By nailing a perfect start, the number seven will appear in the first spot. By working the positioning like a master, the second spot will get a seven as well. If these are followed up by perfect timing on the spurt as well, then a final seven will appear and the horse will get an extra burst of speed as well as some crazy visual effect like some intense blurs or the image shattering like glass.   While the whole visual reward for a well-run race is pretty exciting, the rest of the game plays out in a very straightforward manner. In the regular view, you see your jockey's butt bouncing along as well as all the other horses in front of you. It's also possible to turn the camera to see the nearby horses. Aside from that there's not much to the overall in-game graphics. The appeal is in closely monitoring one's horse's condition in order to get all of the timing down perfectly and winning the race. Unless you're playing the game or are extremely into horse racing, there's not a whole lot to watch or be excited about.   With Gallop Racer 2004 the beauty is underneath the surface with all of the statistics and strategy that goes in chasing the elusive victories. Outside of the races there are tons of details to dig into in finding out what each horse is capable of. The only problem with this is that it's difficult to dig into the information and make sense of all of it if you don't already have an understanding from previous games. With a lack of a tutorial that was in last year's version the learning process is an extensive session of trial and error. By playing through the game lessons get unlocked to help out, but the whole process is very user-unfriendly to those who are new to the series.    Aside from the addition of the extra boost power-up the other big change is that the speedometer now shows two arrows instead of the normal circular bar filling up. One arrow will show the speed that you're asking from the horse and the other will show the speed that he wants to run at. Combined with a cartoonish image of the horse's current condition, this helps to get a good grasp of the situation during the race. If the horse is content, then things are going well. If you bash into other horses or run him ragged, then you'll see him get furious or even cry. Of course, the proof is in the pudding and an unhappy horse will likely lose the race. An excellent blend of arcade action and deep, involving sim that practically guarantees you'll have more luck placing bets next time you visit the race track!", "date": "Sep 2, 2004"}
