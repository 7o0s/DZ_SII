It's a game that clings to and plays on just about every cliche in the videogame universe, from extremely over-the-top violence to undead and Nazi enemies, silly one-liners, and so much more. Often times publishers hide sub par products behind gimmicks like these, but in BloodRayne's case there is an enjoyable experience to be found underneath all of the body limbs and pools of blood.  The Facts  Play as a bloodthirsty and hip vampire agent and kill enemies including zombies and Nazis soldiers Drink enough living blood and you put Agent BloodRayne into an intensely violent state called Bloodlust where she does much more damage.  Drink even more blood and she goes into Bloodrage Agent BloodRayne's supernatural abilities increase throughout the game and include incredible speed, inhuman agility, enhanced vision senses, the ability to ~slow time~ (a la the Matrix) and more Main character uses silver blades attached to her wrists for which she can gain enhancements throughout the game. She's also expert with submachine guns, pistols, harpoon knives, grenades and rifles Horror-filled cinematic action immerses you in a story that you play instead of watch Intelligent enemies seek reinforcements, plan ambushes and use your own weapons against you Camera FX feature allows for automatic slow motion camera panning when spectacular events like dismemberment or explosions occur.  Camera can be triggered to follow any projectile to its target Solid 3D engine draws large, detailed environments complemented by real-time damage models, lighting effects, surfacing scarring, cloth physics and much more   Gameplay Majesco's BloodRayne for Xbox is a shameless cross of Blade and The Matrix with some Castle Wolfenstein thrown in for good measure. The title stars sexy heroine BloodRayne, a half human-half-vampire agent hired by a secret organization known as the Brimstone Society to wipe out a Nazi conspiracy. The story makes no apologies about its inspirations and, probably because it doesn't take itself too seriously, it works.  BloodRayne is a 3D action game in every way, shape and form. Players control the limber vampire girl as she makes her way from the darkly lit swamps of Louisiana in search of spidery beasts to her eventual confrontation in the industrial German factories with several Nazi leaders. The game unfolds in linear style, leading BloodRayne from target to target for the kills, or to accomplish basic goals such as planting a bomb on a Nazi-controlled radio setup, or figuring out a way through a warehouse to the next location. There are breaks in the routine -- boss fights, obstacle challenges and more; at one point the character must take control of a giant mech-robot and blast her way through a level, and these are well paced, welcomed additions. In-game puzzles are practically nonexistent -- the focus is definitely on the many encounters the fast and well-equipped heroine has with hordes of ruthless enemies, all of them primed and ready to be butchered in an exaggerated, grotesque manner that's sure to please the bloodthirsty.  The character moves with surprising speed and precision, can perform a variety of different death moves and utilize a wide selection of powerful weapons. Control feels tight in some regard and loose in others. For instance, the process of manipulating the character about the worlds is intuitive. The developer has employed a dual analog setup -- the main stick moves BloodRayne (forward, backward, left and right) and the other controls her direction as well as the camera. It's the latter that's flawed. Often times, manual or not, the camera is in the wrong place at the wrong time and occasionally it jumps out of whack in a corner, or in a confined corridor, and during similarly small, claustrophobic areas. There are times when it definitely gets in the way, which is mildly frustrating, but because this happens fairly infrequently it's not as troublesome as it could have been.  Terminal Reality has spent a great deal of effort making BloodRayne a force to be reckoned with, and this is definitely noticeable. The character can jump onto enemies and suck their blood, a very satisfying maneuver if a bit cheesy. She can also shoot forth a sharpened chain and rip into foes, pull them closer and feast upon them -- another nasty, but enjoyable move. There are many more, too. BloodRayne can leap and spin, which enables her to break through doors; she can jump and shoot forward her death chain, which serves to damage enemies; and she can flip left or right and dodge out of harm's way. Then there are the weapons -- everything from shotguns to rocket launchers. On top of everything else, she has vampire-specific abilities, from the option to slow down the world in a very ~bullet-time~ borrowed effect that is nonetheless still ultra slick to the power to use her eyes as a long rage scope and home in on enemies. The character can even use her vampire sense to see through walls and where her next major enemy hides. The sheer selection of abilities is, quite frankly, very impressive, not to be shrugged off as an extra, and they all play a very integral part in the action of the experience, which smacks of smart design.    There are some layout oddities, which disappoint. For starters, some of the levels themselves are a bit on the disorienting side -- some of the locales look the same and there are points, particularly in later stages, where players may find themselves scratching their heads in wonder of what to do next. For example, we found ourselves stuck at one point in the game where a piece of flooring collapses to an underwater area below -- a problem, for BloodRayne is damaged by the liquid. We searched for more than an hour before we figured out a way past the obstacle and the experience is best remembered as a kink in the otherwise well formed armor of the action sequences the game has to offer. Also, the game's compass, located in the corner of the play screen, is designed to show BloodRayne where she must go next, but it occasionally sends her directly into walls and it's up to players to discover the correct way around them -- a bit of a stupid system, as far as we're concerned.  Encountering armies of enemies and dynamically devising new ways to dispose of them using BloodRayne's arsenal of options is the title's main appeal, perhaps only outdone by the effects her deadly weapons erupt in violently crude showings. Bodies are exploded, limbs torn apart, and pools of blood splattered as the heroine rips through gangs of undead monstrosities, spider beasts, Nazi soldiers and fights against gigantically oversized boss entities. Call it a guilty pleasure, but it's fun. For some gamers BloodRayne will be more than enough, in spite of its comparatively short play through. But those expecting deep, engaging puzzles or levels meant to inspire are in for a disappointment. The game is much more about the next enemy encounter, the next bloody fight -- not about moving stone blocks to trigger a door. That's not a bad thing -- just a consideration.    Graphics The visual side of BloodRayne is very solid. The game uses an impressive 3D engine built by Terminal Reality to draw big, detailed locales with inspired architecture, above average texture clarity and more. In early stages, gamers walk through swamps filled with misty waters complete with broken down structures, riddled with holes and cracks, which float in water. Later the heroine progresses through candlelight cathedrals with gothic hangings and demonic paraphernalia -- it's very stylistic.  Meanwhile the main character, from the sexy, revealing leather outfit, to the hip hair clips that swing with real physics as she jumps around, is well designed, though quite obviously way over the top. She looks the part of a vampire sex kitten. Some of her animation is equally impressive, particularly seen in slow-motion view a la The Matrix. Other animations, especially for running forward, seem a bit on the stiff side and there is the very occasional view in which she appears to be floating inches above the ground, not walking upon it. The enemy characters, meanwhile, are downright disgusting -- the spidery things that chase gamers around in the early stages still give us chills. It's the Nazi leaders later in the experience that come off more as goofy than anything else, but perhaps that is the point.  Terminal Reality has tried a lot, whether it always works or not. The worlds are varied. They are filled with objects that feature full damage models. Just about everything in the game can be carved up, blown up, or fully destroyed, from book shelves to cabinets, tables to chairs, and more. There are cloth physics. Sheets of Nazi covers hang from walls and if gamers want they can tear them up with BloodRayne's claws -- her primary weapon -- or simply walk through them, at which point they will sway and move back and forth. The texture quality on these pieces of cloth isn't spectacular, but we're impressed that the feature is in the game nonetheless. Lighting effects are everywhere, from the real-time torches that flicker about in environments to the many guns the vampire can rain upon foes, all of which illuminate the immediate area in flashes and bangs. Most impressive of all, easily and without doubt, are the particle effects and subsequent environmental influences -- basically, the gore. BloodRayne is one of the most violent titles in existence and it does its job well -- the blood and guts in this game are executed brilliantly. Particle blood sprays in every direction, body parts are dismembered and thrown into the air, and the floor becomes drenched in red, realistic blood as the female avenger dices and slices. The engine itself spits out tens of enemies on-screen at once, too, which often results in a virtual blood bath of guts and body parts, drenched flooring and splattered walls. It's a mess, but it's done so well that there is a tangible sense of accomplishment having bested a group of Nazi scum, especially when playing in slow time.    On the other hand, the framerate isn't always steady -- there are drops here in there depending upon the architecture detail and the number of enemies on-screen. Massive explosions -- bombs thrown by enemies, also cause the fluidity to chug for a second or two before it can repair itself. Some of the models are terribly low in polygons to the point where they seriously look edgy. There is clipping at points. Some of the texture work is blurry and unrefined. And then there is the camera, which sometimes gets in the way of the action, a disappointment. There is bad here for sure, but the good generally outweighs it.  Sound The audio presence in BloodRayne is probably its weakest element. The game's music is moody and fitting for the environments and there are specific scenes in which some of the sound effects manage to scare too. But the one-liners are usually poorly acted and unnecessary. BloodRayne is known to casually spout out lines like ~You bastard!~ to enemies simply for the point of cussing. She sometimes talks to herself long after an enemy encounter has ended. The 'F' word is also frequently used for no innovative reason. People buying the game for its 'Mature' rating alone will probably laugh with glee at some of the profanities in place, but the rest of the title, for all of its clich?s and borrowed inspirations, somehow comes off as smarter.  More troublesome, though, is that there are very rare audio pops -- almost glitch-like noises, that happen every once in a long while during fights. BloodRayne is not going to change the videogame industry, It has its problems -- some technical shortcomings here and there, some camera oversights and the occasional level layout difficulty, but I have to admit that I enjoyed playing through the 3D action title; that it delivered a fun little ride while it lasted.There's a good amount of entertainment to be had controlling BloodRayne through a series of varied locals while ripping through enemies in orgies of bloody fights. The borrowed ~bullet time~ effects are equally well done and have a real place in the game; there are lots of moves and weapons to be learned, acquired and utilized at the peril of the disgusting foes; and the visuals manage to impress on many levels, from the damage models in place to the detail in the architecture, dynamic lighting effects, cloth physics and more.This is not a bad game. But don't confuse it for a 3D adventure. So long as gamers go in knowing that -- expecting fights and gore versus puzzle solving and a deep, engaging quest of some sort -- they should come away happy in spite of its quick play through and lack of originality.Worth a rental at the very least.", "date": "Oct 14, 2002"}
