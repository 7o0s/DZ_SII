Lights, Camera, Action AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/29/scene-it-lights-camera-action-au-review", "text": "Let's preface this review with two words of caution. This game is for film fanatics. If you're not, you won't get the most from this game. Second, games of this style are aren't for everyone anyway. Like Sony's Buzz series, which didn't introduce interactive TV quiz games, but certainly popularised it on consoles, Scene It? aims to be a party in a box for film fans. However, unlike Buzz, which generally targets the younger, less wrinkly portion of the 'all ages' demographic, Scene It? might actually be better suited to players who are in their late teens and over. This came as a surprise after an extended session of the game with a couple other players all of whom, this reviewer included, were expecting to be held by the hand and patronised to like a dribbling toddler raised on Disney and Nickelodeon.   Let's talk about the box-set you'll be forking out for. Microsoft really knows how to make decent peripherals. Its steering wheel and pedals stand up to a lot of abuse and we still love the 360's gamepad (if only the blessed console was as durable). The so-called Big Button Controllers included in four jellybean colours have a great, solid feel, ergonomically fitted to the hand and made of a higher quality plastic than the Buzz controller. The four buttons on the controller face are pretty much identical to the standard 360 controller, aside from a subtle bump on the base of the B button to remind your thumb of which button you're resting on.   The central button is actually only used every once in a while in the main game - generally you're selecting an answer out of four possibilities, rather than just racing to buzz in first. The button also hides four-way directional control that allows you to scroll through menus on the 360's guide interface.      Sure, the whole game could easily be played with a standard controller, but where's the fun in that? Also worth noting, the controllers themselves are battery operated and infrared, as opposed to true wireless, requiring a clear line of sight between the included infrared USB dongle and the front of the remotes.   The game is divided into three modes - the first two, Short and Long Play, are divided into four rounds. In the first round, you're not penalised for incorrect answers, but in two and three, all bets are off - you really need to be sure of your knowledge, or your score is going to bottom out pretty quickly. Scoring is based on a standard 2000 points per question, which quickly decreases depending on how long it takes you to answer. You have approximately one second of thought time if you want to nail that perfect score.   This isn't quite a perfect scoring system, given that some styles of questions are presented bit by bit, or are illustrated Pictionary style. You'll be really hanging out for the second and third clues to narrow it down from three or four very possible answers. Small design oversights like this only happen once or twice a game, which we're thankful for - though, people trying to maximise their scores to unlock the more challenging achievements may get a little frustrated by some game styles.   The fourth round uses a multiplier scoring system for answering tricky questions back to back. Called the Final Cut, this round returns to the punishing points deduction system for incorrect answers, but the multiplier makes the risk worthwhile.   With a touted 1800-plus questions on the disc, you're very rarely going to run into repeats; for casual players, this might not even be any concern, given this is the kind of game that you might only bring out at movie nights or parties every once in a while. DLC is obviously something that MS is planning, given a prominent option in the menu. As it stands out of the box, the game covers films from the 50s to as recent as 2007. From Animal House to American Beauty, various Ben Stiller comedies, classic Sci-fi, thrillers, action and CG animated movies to off-beat Wes Anderson flicks, westerns and 90s counter-culture movies - Scene It? has serious variety. The use of footage and sound files tends to come from the same films every now and then, but the variety of text-based questions is enormous. The lack of HD footage is a bit of a shame, but we're guessing DVD storage size is the holdback here, rather than a design oversight.   Ooh! Ooh! I know this one! It's The Candyman!  Game styles vary greatly; in some, you'll be viewing clips from a variety of films from a bunch of genres and periods and then you'll be asked random questions about who was doing what, who said what, basic background information and so on. Others sketch out famous scenes in childlike style or remove key characters from scenes using clever photoshopping techniques. You'll be asked to name actors, props from movies, actors and pop culture icons, and finish off quotes, songs and slogans.    These are all connected through nicely animated in-game cutscenes that fly you through various parts of a film studio lot, such as the editing suite, animator's lair, props department, sound room, viewing theatre and more. The voiceover from the emcee is quite grating after a while - albeit less irritating than the Buzz commentator has become of late. He begins to repeat his lines a little too often, but to the game's writers' credit, he occasionally nails a few good jokes.   There are loads of in-jokes and nudge-nudge humour that broach everything from Futurama (Rooooobot Houuuuuse!) to Cheech and Chong. Clearly, this was not a game with kids in mind; there's never anything crude or offensive (this is a PG game, but it warns of 'Mild themes, Mild violence, Mild sexual references, Mild coarse language) but there are moments where some of the possible answers are eyebrow-raisingly witty and downright funny.  The Party Mode throws four players immediately into an infinite quiz, removing all cutscenes and randomising activities. It's a nice touch that is perfect for leaving on at a party for people to come along and drop in or out of. And that's Scene It? in a nutshell. It's a game with a simple format that is executed really well. The presentation isn't anything flash, but the pace is pretty spot-on; you can skip through most of the between-round cutscenes, the number of questions and variety of styles is perfect for full-time film buffs and part-time gamers.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
