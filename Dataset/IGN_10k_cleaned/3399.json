Golf is a snore to watch on TV, and I don't want to worry about the angle of my 4-iron when I'm trying to chip from the rough. In spite of all that, I had a blast with Sony's Hot Shots Golf.  Hot Shots was developed by Camelot Software, which is best known for RPGs, not its sports games. These are the people behind the Shining series on the Genesis and the Saturn, and the execrable Beyond the Beyond on the PlayStation. Gotta love those big-headed characters, though. As designers, however, they've always had a talent for powerful interfaces and clean, deep gameplay.  Camelot's golf game is the perfect combination of simpler, arcade-like action with the harder, more technical golf simulation. Of course, as everyone should know, the basic object behind the sport is to knock pimply overweight teenage ping-pong ball into a whole which is several hundred yards away from your starting point. You can play on this level if you want to, just pinging the ball with automatically selected clubs and suggested angles. The swinging power/accuracy meter are a neat way to add reflexes into a slow sport, and you can still get a decent golf score this way.  For players who want to go deeper, there are whole ranges of options to explore. There's an easy-to-learn hitting system, where you can add top spin, back spin, hooks and slices to your shot. You also have a full range of clubs to choose from, and the tutorials included in the game make it easy to pick up the tinier nuances.  Once you begin playing the game, it gets better and better. Learning the terrain is a simple task with handy flying cameras and a useful terrain indicator contained within the golf ball icon on the right side. The putting grid is simplistic, but also useful. After a while, you'll feel almost feel like a real golfer, except you dress nicer.  The key draw to this game, though, is the depth. Like the RPGers they are, the Camelot designers use experience points to unlock extra characters and courses. For fifty points, for example, you get another course to play as well extra chracters with different attributes. It's a demanding system, because it forces you to learn the course and the play mechanics well before you can move on. But hey, if it's all too much for you, content yourself with the classic miniature golf game included on the CD.  So, if you're not a serious golfer, but wouldn't mind a fun golf game that you'll keep playing despite yourself, Hot Shots is the one for you.  Jeff Chen", "date": "May 8, 1998"}
