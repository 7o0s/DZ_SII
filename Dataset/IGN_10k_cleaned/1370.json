The newest system to be graced by the sublime presence of this divine series is Sony's newly released PlayStation 2. And the thing that PlayStation 2 owners are getting is what is arguably the very best that this cherished series has ever seen, as it is essentially a graphically enhanced version of the critically acclaimed PlayStation release with some other nice little touches.   Gameplay  The best way to describe the gameplay in Madden NFL 2001 on PlayStation 2 is that it plays just like Madden. The feel of the game hasn't really changed and people that are completely familiar with the any of the previous releases in the series will find themselves right at home when playing this version of the game.   The one thing that this game does better than other football games, including previous releases in the series, is its realistic physics model that makes the game feel more like real football than what you'll get in any other football game. The Madden series has pretty much been the only one that has really factored in momentum and it has been done better here on PS2 than ever before in the series. Because of this the players move and react just like they would in a real life situation. If you're moving in one direction at full speed, it won't be possible to change your direction instantly like you can in other games. Some people don't like this, but it makes for some plays that work out in a very realistic fashion because player momentum can be used to your advantage just like in a real NFL game. It's possible to realistically position defenders to get blocked by your full back and take seams exactly like a player would in a genuine football game.   This, however, does come at a cost. People wanting complete and unadulterated control of the onscreen characters might feel that the reactions of the players aren't as fast and responsive as what they expect in a videogame. Because momentum is factored into the equation, the onscreen athletes won't always be able turn exactly where they want to instantly, which can be frustrating for some game players. The only other complaint that we can see people having with the movement in Madden is that it feels a bit slow compared to other football games on the market, including the 32-bit version of the game on PlayStation. While the general pace of the game is a little slower than the other football titles, it feels better in my book because the relative speed of the players seems handled in a much more accurate way that it is in other games.   Beyond the physics model, which feels more refined than it does in the game's PlayStation brethren, the rest of the game pretty plays the same. The same good and bad things that can be said about the passing game in the PlayStation version can be said again for Madden on PlayStation 2. The passing routes and plays that are available to the player to vary a bit from team to team, but they are all basically the same as what we've seen in the Madden series over the past decade. While it is indeed possible to lead the receiver with the pass, it's not really completely under the control of the player and there's no way to throw a pass based entirely on the route that's being run. Instead, the pass is typically thrown in the direction that the player is facing when you lead them. This particular shortcoming with the game's passing mechanics makes it impossible to effective throw timing passes based on where players are headed before they make the cut. The route based passing button doesn't really work the way that it should be.   Another problem is that the receivers still lack intelligence in their routes and typically just run their patterns and only alter them when they are bumped or pushed out of their way. They won't find holes in the zone or settle in on an open spot like they do in the real sport. This is obviously asking a lot, but it's something that would enhance the virtual football experience immensely if it was implemented into a game.   Just as the case is with the passing game, the running game in Madden on PlayStation 2 is essentially a carbon copy of what you get in the PlayStation version of the title. Practically all of the running plays and techniques that'll gain you chunks of yardage in the game on PlayStation will do the same on PlayStation 2. While this isn't a good thing for those that have already mastered the 32-bit version, it's not really a complete knock on the game because no other football series in the videogame world has handled the intricacies of the rushing attack as well as EA Sports has with Madden. Knowing how to best follow your lead blockers and finding seams in the defense are as important as always and are actually a bit more prevalent because it's much easier to see the blocks because of the game's improved graphical details. One area where the running game in the PlayStation 2 game actually surpasses the PlayStation version has to do with the fact that player momentum and the general physics with collisions appear to be much more realistic. This might be just because you can see the players better because of the increased level of detail, but the end result is the feeling that it the speed that the players are moving, their sizes and the angles that they collide at are completely authentic in every respect.   Defensively, the only thing worth noting is that it's still quite effective to line up your defensive ends extremely wide and speed rush the quarterback on just about every play. Additionally, the defenses in the game don't really adjust their positioning to changes with the positioning with the offensive players as much as they should. This creates many situations where you'll see a single defensive back covering two or more wide receivers off of the line. This doesn't come into play as much as one would think, though, as once the play starts, the receivers will generally be covered by the defenders that should've moved over in a man-on-man situation. The only reason that this is a problem is that it takes away a lot of the strategy involved with reading defenses in the game.   Whereas the quality of the gameplay is always debatable, there's no arguing the fact there's not another football series around that's nearly as robust as what players are presented with in Madden. In addition to the standard single player season and exhibition modes, the game has the most jam-packed franchise mode that you'll find anywhere. Players can take any team (or even multiple teams) and take control over the franchise for years on end, using either the original rosters, created rosters, and even created players. Players will retire, can suffer career ending injuries (created players aren't invincible, either) and successful players will even demand more money when it comes contract time. And what really makes all of this even more gratifying is that the career statistics of your player are kept track of and it's possible to break and maintain single season and individual game records throughout the course of a franchise's existence. The only real thing that's lacking would be the fact that there aren't any career records that are tracked to be broken. So, there's no chance for you to create a player and have him go on to break Marino's career passing records or anything of the like.   Another feature of Madden that helps make it even more replayable than just about any other videogame ever conceived is that it makes excellent use of these Madden Cards and Madden Challenges that give players incentives to achieve various different tasks during each game. This helps give players goals other than just beating your opponent into the ground and really helps a lot in keeping the game fun even after you've managed to win six consecutive Super Bowl titles with the dominating Miami Dolphins led by all-pro running back Dave Zdyrko....   Graphics  If there was ever a game that really showed off how much more powerful the PlayStation 2 is than any other system current available on the market, it would have to be this one. Sure the system has its flaws and there have been many complaints about its lack of texture memory or inability to easily perform tasks such as anti-aliasing, but when you look at what EA Sports was able to accomplish in Madden compared to what Visual Concepts did with NFL2K1, it'll make you a believer in the power of Sony's 128-bit behemoth of a system.   The first and most significant difference that you'll see when comparing Madden to NFL2K1 or any other football game is that it just uses so many more polygons. Because of this, the player models, the football and other 3D objects in the game just look much more lifelike in appearance because they don't have any hard edges typically associated with low-poly models. The shoulder pads, helmets, thigh pads, facemasks, and just about everything that you see on the screen looks more lifelike than what we've ever seen in a sports game before this. Going beyond just what's seen on the play field, other details that are also possible include referees, linesman, the chain gang, and teammates on the sidelines that are completely 3D and even interactive in some cases. It's completely possible to bump into and knock over the guys in the pinstripes that are holding up the chains.   What makes everything even more believable is that the game's textures give the game the feeling of being real. The texture detail can be best seen in things like the convincing look of things like the mesh in the jersey of the players' uniforms, the way the grass and dirt stains look as the game progresses along, and the fact that the skin of muscle tones of the players look real. The amount of graphical details that can be seen in this game are just mind-boggling and it's unbelievable that the developers have been able to do this all with its very first attempt at programming for PlayStation 2, a system that has been notorious for its amazingly steep learning curve and difficulty to program for.   The details and visual excellence doesn't end there, as the game makes excellence use of the lighting capabilities of the system. Games can be played during different times of the day and the lighting effects during each period are just simply beyond belief. My personal favorite is when you play a game where the sun is shining at a low angle and while it's facing the back of your players, the jerseys are brighter and when it's the other way around, they'll be darker. It's not only a nice little touch, but it's handled so perfectly that it really does look like the back of the player is either in the sun or is not being shined on by the sun. Madden also has a few other cool extras, like the fact that players can get grass stuck in their facemasks when they go head first into the ground and the brilliant use of realistic looking weather effects. Whereas the rain just falls in 2K1, you can actually see it hit the ground and splash when players run in puddles in Madden.   The game's amazing level of detail can also be seen in its excellent player animation. The way that the players run down the field, make turns, dive for balls, make one handed grabs and go down low for passes at the knees, have never before looked quite this good in a videogame. On the other hand, there does seem to be a lack of transitional animation from move to move, causing there to be some unrealistic jerks that help keep the game from looking like you're watching a game on TV. What's more, there also seems to be a little force field around the player models that causes them to actually collide and react with each other before the polygonal models actually make contact with each other. It's another thing that keeps it from looking completely real.    The only other complaints that can be made about the game's graphical quality is that there are indeed patches of slowdown to be found, the proportion of the players aren't quite as good as they should be and the eyes of the players are completely messed up. It is worth noting that the slowdown only really occurs on some of the close-ups during automatic replays and the eyes, well, there's no excuse for the big, white and reflective eyes that make the players look like they from another planet.   Sound  While it might seem like blasphemy, the John Madden football series could be much improved if it only kept the Madden name and got rid of his god-awful color commentary. The stuff he says doesn't really make any sense and never really fits what has just happened on the screen. Sure, he's a god in the world of football, but he's really past his prime in the game and in the announcer's box. Outside of Madden's boring and repetitious babble that makes you wish that EA never ever thought up the idea of having Maddenisms in its football game, there's not really anything else that's significant to complain about. The basic football sounds are fairly well done and so are the crowd noises and other odds ands ends.   Note to EA, please get a new commentary team for next year's game or at least try and implement it better than it is here.

With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. There can be arguments made against Madden's superiority by gamers that prefer the style of games like NFL2K1 or NFL GameDay, but there's really no denying the game's greatness. This series is the granddaddy of virtual football and for all intents and purposes, this version of the game is the finest of the entire bunch. It's arguable that because it's slower moving than the PlayStation version that it's not really as good, but that would be overlooking the other aspects of the game that have been improved in the divine PS2 version of the game. Not only do the game's visuals make it more realistic looking than any other football videogame on the planet, but the game's superior physics model makes it feel much better than its ugly PlayStation cousin. The easy way to say it is that if I had a choice to take with me only one football game to a deserted island and only have that game to play for the rest of my life, it would be Madden NFL 2001 on PlayStation 2.
