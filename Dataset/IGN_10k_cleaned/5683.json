It's certainly foolish to believe that designers can ~out Tetris~ Tetris,  but there's absolutely nothing wrong with creators attempting to offer something along similar lines. After all, the puzzle genre works best on the portables because of the handheld systems' friendliness towards instant gratification, quickshot game designs.   Nintendo's Polarium can technically claim a few parallels with Tetris: it's a launch title with the new handheld platform, its design involves manipulating tiles of different configurations, and it's a simple concept that anyone can grasp nearly right from the get-go. Even with these parallels, Polarium is so far removed from Tetris that it's a stretch to even compare the two. Nintendo's DS puzzler is definitely unique, certainly addictive, and essentially couldn't be done on any other gaming platform. Its welcome simplicity is also its one downside: there's just not much to it.   Polarium melds players' stylus handling abilities with mind-bending challenges. In each of the modes, the task is to turn white tiles black and/or black tiles white, attempting to form horizontal lines of the same hue to remove them from play. To do this, it's all about drawing a line across the tile grid to flip the tiles to their polar opposites; the tiles that lay under the line you've drawn will go from white to black or black to white. Neutral gray titles are a ~free pass~ for players to continue their line without affecting any of the in-play tiles.   Polarium's meat is in its individual puzzle designs. There are 100 unique layouts that must be completed by removing all tiles from play in one single stroke of the stylus. Early on it's a cakewalk to find the right path, but about a third of the way into these challenges you'll have to really wrack the brain to see the proper line to draw. The real skill is in seeing how to manipulate both black and white at the same time, not just one or the other. Hints are available when you're stuck; the upper, non-touch screen is used to show the last attempt on the current panel, which is definitely handy as a reference to figure out where you went wrong.         What's really slick about this mode is the ability to create and save your own puzzle creations to cartridge. The game makes sure that any design can be solved by challenging the creators to solve it themselves; once it's successful, players can convert that puzzle into an extensive, numerical password so that buddies can pull that puzzle up on their own cartridge. Of course, those puzzles can also be transmitted to anyone's cart provided they're within local wireless range. It's this option that really extends Polarium's staying power.     The other half of Polarium is Challenge Mode an attempt to offer a Tetris-style of game design where falling structures move from the upper screen to the lower screen, stacking up when they hit the bottom of the pit. Here, players use their line drawing skills to remove as much of the tiles from play before the stack reaches the top of the bin. The problem: this mode sounds like a winner, but in practice it doesn't come off nearly as well as the Puzzle Mode. The first portion of the game is simply memorizing the particular stacks and drawing the line before they even hit the bottom of the bin. After the first round, the blocks stack up almost arbitrarily, which makes it difficult to play the game the way it was meant to be played.   But the blandness of Challenge Mode is rectified with a rather decent multiplayer option using a similar idea. This two player competition pits players one on one, sending completed lines out of their bin into the opposition's. When all of the lines end up in one player's bin, the match is over. It's a hectic matchup that can last a couple of seconds or a few minutes depending on the skills of the player and the luck of the draw in the tile layouts. To add a little bit more to the mayhem, there are power-ups to help or hinder; slowing opponent's sent lines or speeding up your own, for example. The best part: multiplayer only needs one copy of the game, with the owner sending the necessary files over to the cartridge-free system.   The problems with Polarium are few but enough to put a dent in the overall production value. The game's control has an overall ~stiff~ feeling due to its reliance on drawing lines that perfectly match the grid-like pattern of the tiles. The responsiveness between drawing the line and ~tapping~ the end to tell the game the line's complete is a bit on the laggy side that gets better with practice, but it's still not as tight as a puzzle game should be. It's a problem that's simply inherent with the game's direction; I can't imagine any better way of controlling Polarium, so ~stiff~ it will always feel.         Polarium's minimal presentation, obviously the development team's artistic choice, is certainly interesting and gives the game a look of its own, but its lack of color or graphical flash isn't something easily ignored. It's cool that the developers focused more on gameplay than imagery, but that doesn't mean the package couldn't use just a little more splash of color. We're past the days of grayscale Game Boy, folks. Old-school arcade games have had more visual appeal than this title.  There's no doubting the originality of Polarium's design, and the fact that it puts the Nintendo DS' unique functions to use means that it's a game that really couldn't be played on any other system out there. But it's not a game for the sloppy player, since it really requires a precise handling on stylus drawing. The two-color concept works in some areas and doesn't in others, but overall it's a puzzle game that's not like anything you've played before, and the little elements, like multiplayer and puzzle creation, add a lot to an extremely minimal package.", "date": "Apr 15, 2005"}
