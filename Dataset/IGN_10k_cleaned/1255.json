For about four years new game companies have been trying to make a decent RC game, and after Acclaim's zippy and fun-filled RC Revenge, Mattel has followed suit by hitting the target dead-on with Tyco RC Assault with a Battery.    Gameplay For anyone who's played kart or RC games before the premise here should be familiar. The little hook here is that Mattel has based its game on the actual toy cars called Tyco Racing Cars, and so their shape, speed, and their particular kind of sturdiness is all part of the game as well.   Tyco RC features eight real RC cars from the Tyco toy lineup, which includes Nitro Dozer, a racer with treads, which transforms into a bulldozer; Hot Rocker, a bug-shaped car that bashes through any obstacle; Tantrum, which spotlights a spinning axel that damages cars in front of it; Recoil, a 4X4 SUV that spins into a tornado to damage opponents; Fast Traxx, a dual motor vehicle with treads; the Rebound 4X4, a flipping minicar packing lots of torque; and Speed Wrench, a wide pick-up truck that transforms into a vehicle twice its width.   The design of each car is actually elaborate in its construction. These features include acceleration, speed, charge power, turning ability, collision, power, and their own special characteristic. By picking the Speed Wrench for instance, you may not travel at light speeds, like you do with the Rebound 4X4, but when you transform the car, it spreads out twice its normal width and its tires damage nearby opponents. Even the Rebound 4X4, which has the ability to flip sides, has a different set of driving characteristics on the other side that affect its driving behavior.   The cars go through an abnormal amount of punishment from one another and the environment itself. It's visceral fun just to watch them crash and burn, and it's even more fun when you get to play against a friend in one- to two-person multiplayer. So, any gamer who already likes the Tyco brand battery-powered cars should like this game, but for those who aren't and who simply want to play fun racers, this should bring a little bit of fresh air into their lives. I personally loved those kinds of cars when I was a kid but I never got them for Christmas. Now that I'm just a little bit older I don't really even care about whether I control one ever, but I nonetheless really liked driving these cars.   While the two central differences that make this game a little different are the course designs and the transformation abilities, the level designs are quite interactive and creative in design. All are totally fictional and theme-based courses and surprisingly, they aren't all round either.   What adds a real challenge into the racing formula, however, is their level of interaction. Easy to hit switches checker the courses, each one setting off some kind of hazardous spot. In one level, it's rolling tires, in another, it's a bridge that flips up, and in another it's icy regions that turn your car into ice cubes. While each course appears to contain at least two of these interactive regions, they add that necessity to learn the track element, which adds depth into the gameplay mix.   Developer Lucky Chicken Games did a great job of adding in as much as possible into the game to make it fun, rewarding, and different. I mean, these cars are really well designed and speedy. If you want real speed, you can simply start the game over with 9.OV Jet Turbo Master, which is damn fast. But when was the last time you played a game while the data was loading? It was with the very first Ridge Racer and Tekken games and you played Galaga and Galaxan while the games were loading. That was genius. And it happened in 1995.   In Tyco RC Assault with a Battery, players get to play a handful of games while the screen loads, at least two of which includes chickens. In one, you avoid being hit by cars, and in the other, you play a simplified Space Invaders game in which a bird careens slowly down toward you, dropping feces while you try to shoot it down. It's the thought that counts, and these guys have thought quite a bit about this one.   Graphics Let's be straight, Tyco isn't Final Fantasy IX, but it's not Fogger, either. Using cartoon-style settings much like the Army Men universe -- i.e. little toy cars in real adult worlds, the game is cute and consistent in its settings. The contrast in sizes and worlds works.   What Lucky Chicken Games did well was to maximize all of the PlayStation's effects as best as possible. This game swells with lighting effects, smoke, shining translucent and transparent surfaces, tons of particle effects, and great vehicle textures and reflection maps to boot. The game goes through the whole range of effects and it's quite effective, surprisingly so.   Sound The average sounds of rock and techno haven't been more moderate than this. The music and the sound effects in this game are right there in the middle of the road. Nothing is memorable and nothing sucks either. I can truly say it's average. The IGN office is overflowing with games at this time of the year, and I have to say that I wasn't particularly interested in playing another little kiddy racing game. But Tyco RC is pretty damn fun. The single-player modes are great and the two-player matches will get you jumping out of your seat, swearing at your brother, and calling him names he thought you had forgotten. This one isn't just for little squirts, it holds its own in any age group.", "date": "Sep 16, 2000"}
