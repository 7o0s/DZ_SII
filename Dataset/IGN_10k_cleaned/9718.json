The highly anticipated adventure, based on the first book in the ~His Dark Materials~ trilogy by Philip Pullman, has everything you could want in a fantasy film from a free-spirited little girl to a talking polar bear. It also has Sam Elliot doing only what Sam Elliot can do, lending the movie the most gravitas you'll ever hear delivered with a southern accent.Of course, every major movie like ~The Golden Compass~ must be accompanied by a mobile game, and Sega isn't about to break any traditions here. Unfortunately, Sega is standing steadfast by one other tradition, too: Bad movie-based games. The Golden Compass for mobile is a very paint-by-numbers side-scrolling game that offers little original for the smallest screen, save for a polar bear fight.The game loosely mirrors the plot of the movie, following heroine Lyra from the campus of Jordan College, where her uncle makes a startling discovery about Dust and Lyra receives the titular golden compass. Of course, just being handed the compass wouldn't be much of a challenge, so in the game, Lyra must recover it from the rooftop of the college. I mention this segment -- the opener, in fact -- because it underscores one of the biggest problems with the whole of the game that follows: Poor controls. Lyra's jumping is floaty and inconsistent. It's entirely too easy to miss a ledge due to the need for precision jumping and the game's inability to provide it. Too many Lyras lay on the ground of Jordan College, their bodies shattered because of one... slight... misstep.(By the way -- I talk about the plot in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid any potential spoilers, I advise you skip it.)From Jordan, Lyra heads off to London where she must escape the clutches of Miss Coulter and then to Trollesund to meet Iorek, the aforementioned polar bear. (This leads into a collecting quest.) Iorek must reclaim his crown in Bolvangar. And finally, the game culminates in the ice fields that mark a major battle between the Magisterium's forces and, well, everybody else. Along the way, Lyra engages in plenty of crate-scaling, climbing, jumping, and basic platforming. Lyra is also accompanied by Pan, her personal daemon that occasionally helps out by scurrying through areas Lyra or Iorek cannot access. Pan can get into a scrap, too, such as a fight with Coulter's daemon, a nasty monkey-like thing.Very little about this entire six-level adventure raises the pulse, save for the bear fight. Lyra's attack, rock throwing, is another example of how the developer seemingly put little effort into the game. Depending on how long you hold down the action button, the harder Lyra throws the rock. But that only affects distance, not the actual power of the rock. Hitting somebody with a limp toss does the same damage as a full-on overhead hucking. There are also some very basic puzzles involving the golden compass itself at the end of stages.The game looks just okay. The characters are decently detailed and the backdrops look alright, but the game just has the air of a rushed production due to deadlines -- and that's just no way to create a video game, mobile or console. The storytelling in the game makes little sense, too, so even if you played it before seeing the movie, you're hardly spoiling anything except for knowing what locations appear in the movie. Oh, that there's a bear fight. (Which, incidentally, was one of my favorite parts of the movie.)The Golden Compass is a miss. The cookie-cutter formula for a side-scrolling movie-based game is in full effect. You could drop any character from any book or movie in here and the game would hardly feel different.
