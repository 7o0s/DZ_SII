Hell, Nintendo demonstrated the system's adeptness to the genre right from the start with Metroid Prime Hunters way back at the system's debut six months prior to its launch. And with all this time in developers' hands, all we have to show for FPS action is a bland rendition of GoldenEye and the worst version of Kong on any system. This is an opportunity of a life for a publisher and development team on which to pounce. Unfortunately, Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd misses it like an out-of-whack Air Soft gun. Its heart is in the right place, but that's just not enough -- poor control, sluggish movement, wonky collision, and bug-ridden gameplay are just a short laundry list of problems this shooter's got.   The last time a Paintball game hit a Nintendo handheld system was way back nearly a half decade on the Game Boy Color in the form of Ultimate Paintball. Activision's game for the DS is Halo in comparison, but that's not saying much considering the competition. And compared to what's expected out of a first-person shooter on a capable 3D system, this game doesn't cut it.   The Nintendo DS version of Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd is based on the sleeper hit series that graced the Xbox last year, but this portable rendition is nowhere near as good as these better-than-average playing console first-person shooters. The concept is sound: it's Paintball. One hit and you're out, though there are plenty of opportunities to cheat the system by wiping the paint off before the ref catches your actions. Tournament Paintball Max'd tries to do good in the genre, offering a whole slew of control options, sensitivity control, selectable and configurable characters, and all sorts of tournament play locations. Players can choose to maneuver with the D-Pad, the touch screen, or a combination of both, and for those who can't grasp the concept of the Thumb Strap the team has put together a slideshow tutorial explaining how it works. And there's even functionality to customize your team, since Tournament Paintball is a three-on-three sport.   But then the game starts going south when in action. Even at the highest control sensitivity it takes an uncomfortable amount of time to maneuver and spin around quickly, which is one of the first things you'd want to do in a first-person shooter. You cannot adjust control from one configuration to the next while in a match, either. And for some unfathomable reason, you cannot walk forward and sidestep at the same time - pushing the diagonal positions on the controller cancels out the sidestepping and forces the players to simply walk straight. It's like trying to run with your shoelaces tied together.    The game's badness isn't just limited to control. Character movement and shot detection is wonky at best due to sloppy collision handling.  Obstacles have a wider, invisible ~shell~ of collision surrounding them, which ends up causing your paintballs to splat in mid-air several pixels to the left, right, or above them. These collision shells also cause your character to trip up against seemingly nothing, which makes running an escape route somewhat of a chore. And the developers jam so many controls all over the Nintendo DS that one game's important function - cheating - is hindered because it's forced to share important button placement with other controls. So if you happen to get shot while moving with the A button, the ~cheat meter~ will pop up and accidentally be activated, simply because the button that controls it is already being pressed.    Visually, Tournament Paintball shows that the DS isn't anywhere near the level of graphical ability of the current generation consoles. In other words, this game's pretty ugly. The 3D engine is capable enough of showing some texture detail, but everything comes off pixilated, blurry and choppy with a framerate that's clearly below 30 frames per second. It's certainly playable at this rate because Paintball isn't necessarily a fast-paced experience. But it's tough to see where the paintballs are flying because the game can't render them fast enough - big green balls simply chop-chop-chop by the players' heads. It's also somewhat silly to be playing a Paintball game that doesn't allow the player to literally paint up the environments. This engine can only handle two splats in the environment, and they disappear almost immediately after hitting their target. It's a disappointingly sanitary and sterile Paintball experience.   But hey, at least sound gets the royal treatment. The development team jam that cartridge to the brim with digitized, recorded licensed tunes that are really crisp, offering only a slight hint of compression. Of course, these licensed tunes are Gangsta Rap and grinding metal, which seems just a little out of place for a paintball game that encourages careful, almost stealth-like movement and strategy to beat the other opponents.  Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd could have been the game to satisfy DS gamers' FPS itch until Metroid Prime Hunters' release this March. Instead, we're still waiting. Granted, Paintball isn't really in the same league as a real first-person shooter blastfest, but it at least should comply with the genre basics. Tournament Paintball is a clunky mess that's playable, but on some sadistic, frustrating level.", "date": "Feb 8, 2006"}
