It is an event that challenges the endurance of man and machine. Participants utilize specially equipped sport utility vehicles, dirt bikes, and trucks to carry them through the harsh road to Dakar. Now GameCube owners can experience it in Dakar 2 from Acclaim, a fun but flawed rendition of the legendary rally event. Rally fans that don't mind arcade style controls and unimpressive visuals will find this game worth its $19.99 budget price.  Features  Two-player simultaneous racing GBA connection bonuses 12 rally racing environments Dolby pro logic 2 support Race trucks, SUVs, or dirt bikes Damage effects how vehicles handle Customize vehicle settings to suit various tracks Officially licensed vehicles $19.99 budget priced   Gameplay In an attempt to recreate the excruciating race from Paris to Dakar, Acclaim has offered a series of twelve tracks along the race route. Course locals range from French villas to African deserts. Each course has certain characteristics to which gamers can customize their vehicle. Matching the correct tire composition, suspension, gear ratio, and tire pressure to the corresponding track is a nice touch but is oversimplified for hard core racing fans.  There are three vehicle types to choose from in Dakar 2. First there is the ~car~ class, which consists of SUV type vehicles that have the most well rounded attributes out of all the classes. Motorcycles offer quick acceleration in exchange for touchy controls. Trucks are the most difficult vehicles to race with do to their slow acceleration and tendency to flip over. The game would have improved greatly if more attention to detail would have been given to the motorcycle and truck classes. As is, they feel too shallow.  Vehicles experience wear and tear throughout the length of each course. Players will encounter steering, engine, tire, and suspension problems from various negative factors while racing. The player can fix these problems but not without a sacrifice to their race time. This helps to create a more frantic feeling in the heat of a race and it's pretty well done. Players will be asking themselves if they should stop and fix their steering or attempt to deal with it and keep the top position.  Kick up smoke as you gain speed  The control layout is one to be admired, whether it is a testament to the Cube's controller design or to Acclaim for taking advantage of it. Playing the game with manual transmission is a must. Not only does the C-stick shifting feel great, but also shifting can add greatly to the overall racing experience. For example, constantly revving past the red line will damage one's engine, resulting in a slower acceleration and top speed. This touch of realism adds to the racing experience.  Dakar 2 succeeds for the most part in creating a fun arcade rally racer. Gamers will find most tracks fairly exciting and tense enough to make them tighten their grip on the controller. Players can unlock some pretty impressive machines by completing the game in campaign mode. Which is a good incentive to keep on racing. Along with some neat GBA downloads which play in the top down ~RC Pro Am~ style, Dakar 2 has enough goodies to earn its $20 price tag. But players expecting a phenomenal racer, in any regard, won't find it here.    Graphics Dakar 2 is no showstopper when it comes to graphics. At first glance it could be mistaken for a PS 1 title. Textures are very blurry and the framerate is inconsistent. Course environments consist mostly of badly textured dirt, which quickly becomes boring. Vehicle models are not extremely low in polygons but they are scarred by the same bad textures present in the levels. Dakar 2 just can't compete with the eye candy that most of today's racing games offer.  Lighting effects would have been a positive addition to the overall look of the game. It is baffling as to why the developer included a button dedicated to turning the vehicle's lights on and off when it renders no change to the environment. Animation is also quite choppy, especially in the case of the motorcycles. There is something wrong with seeing a motorcycle round a hairpin turn at 90 mph in the dirt with just a slight lean. You get what you pay for when it comes to graphics. If you out a high value on photo realistic graphics then you should avoid this title. If you miss the blurry textures of the N64 era, Dakar 2 will be a trip down memory lane.  Sound Dakar 2 comes complete with Pro Logic 2 support. Surround sound would have been a good idea if there were more competing vehicles on the track with you. That way you could hear the other engines around you. In Dakar 2, surround sound is almost useless because of the lack of competing vehicles on the track with you. With any racing game the roar of the engine is a vital tool to create a fast paced atmosphere. Engine sounds serve their purpose in creating atmosphere in Dakar 2, but tend to overpower the already weak music tracks. The soundtrack consists of mostly generic techno sounds. Music tracks quickly become indistinguishable from one another, thus numbing the sense of variety in each stage.  When racing in either the cars or trucks, the player is given audio descriptions of the track from their computer passengers. As the player approaches a turn, the computer will warn of its intensity. This is helpful as the player is not always able to steer through the terrain while analyzing the map. Sound effects would have benefited from more variety. The same squeaking metal, glass shatter effect plays for ever roll and tree collision. The overall sound design in Dakar 2 is average. There are some nice gritty engine sounds, but music and crash sounds need improvement.Cube owners who are in dire need of a rally racing experience will find Dakar 2 well worth its $20 price tag. Hard core racing fans may be turned off by the arcade style controls and painful visuals. Lets hope the nifty C-stick shifting will be used more in future racing titles on the Cube. Unlockable vehicles, reverse tracks, and GBA extras do a great job in extending its replay value. Overall Dakar 2 is suitable for those looking for a simple and fun arcade rally game, and do not mind its outdated graphics.", "date": "Apr 23, 2003"}
