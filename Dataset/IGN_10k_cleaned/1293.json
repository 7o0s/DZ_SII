More than a year later, Alice in Wonderland is brought to life on the handheld for a Nintendo-published release, and while it's not as fast-paced as the vine-swinging hero's portable game, Alice gets the first-class treatment on Nintendo's handheld.  Features  More than 20 levels Battery save for three players Secret levels and hidden treats Game Boy Printer support Only for Game Boy Color  From start to finish, the game is designed entirely with the plot of the movie -- oh, sure, it'll jump back and forth when you get into Wonderland, but Digital Eclipse put together a game that feels like the license it's using for its gameplay. Early in the game you're off to chase after the strange white rabbit into a hole...the entrance to Wonderland. The game spans across many, many levels, all of which are created with the film and license in mind. Some levels focus on Alice's ability to shrink and grow via the flora of Wonderland -- some platforms are only accessible when she's mouse-sized, but she can't jump high enough to reach structures when she's her normal five-foot height. If anything, Alice in Wonderland shows that games can be made to follow films and still introduce cool gameplay elements.  Side-scrolling platform games are a dime a dozen on the Game Boy Color, so to make one stand out in this crowd you're going to need variety. And that's where Alice in Wonderland succeeds -- it's not the same thing over and over and over again with different platform layouts. The designers actually changed the pace of the game by supplying changes to each level's design. In one level you'll be hopping and running through a side-scrolling world, and the next you'll be shrunk down and plunked into a bottle to brave the rapids to the next level. The game's main focus is its standard platform design, but it's this variety that insures that playing Alice from start to finish doesn't get old.  And even though this title is demographically aimed at the young girl market, don't think the challenge in Alice in Wonderland is a slouch -- there's some serious brickwalls to get through in the form of tough level design. Most of the game isn't terribly taxing, but there are points when you wonder if the younger crowd will be able to get through them.  But there's a lot of payoff to the design -- you can uncover loads of secrets, including printable pictures and hidden levels by performing specific tasks in the game. The only real flat point to Alice in Wonderland is its rather lame ~Hot/Cold~ game where you spend a hundred seconds finding the hiding white rabbit in an overhead map -- not only is it a dull level, it's also way too easy to win.    With the Disney license comes art and animation that's as good as you're going to get on the little Game Boy Color screen. There's also a few levels with some nifty GBC hardware tricks thrown in to show that this game was worked on by some very competent handheld programmers -- case in point, the unnecessary but cool reflection that pops up in the water when Alice hops across the pond's rocks. There are occasions where the sprites flicker and the action slows down, but it's not enough to really say it detracts from the gaming experience.   There are some gameplay annoyances that give Alice in Wonderland that irritating ~trial-and-error~ element -- the only way you're going to know to avoid something is to actually get yourself killed over and over. This only happens in a few levels, so it doesn't overwhelm with death sequences.  The game is a top-notch platform adventure games on the handheld, and -- despite its demographic -- it's made for everyone in mind.

Alice in Wonderland is most likely going to sell high-ish numbers in stores because of its license, and thankfully folks aren't going to get suckered -- this game is a quality one.", "date": "Sep 29, 2000"}
