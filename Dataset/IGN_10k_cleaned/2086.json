It's not all that fun anymore. Everything about it is as old and creaky as the slow loading doors in Resident Evil. I mean it. The whole series needs some serious WD-40. But perhaps that's not even strong enough.   When I see a game like Capcom's genius Devil May Cry, or even play the cool, impressive Onimusha, it's nearly impossible to go back and play Resident Evil again and love it like I once did. And this is coming from a loyal Capcom man, I guy who still stubbornly defends Resident Evil to those who might slough it off as a bad game. Why? Because in the past, Resident Evil has provided me with countless jumps, scares, loads of tension, complex, surprising stories, and likeable characters. It's a rich series, but man is it aging.   It's not like I hate this game, but this is an 18-month old port of a Dreamcast game, and what's more it's not even a minor leap in control or gameplay at this point on PS2. On the flip side, what this game offers is a solid, long adventure with extra CG (about 10 extra minutes of it), great-looking polygonal environments (a first for the series), and some jolting, tense moments.   Perhaps Code: Veronica X is best wrapped up in a short summary paragraph. If you're willing to chase down keys, medallions, and for the love of God, doorknobs, then the story will be worth it to you. Second, the PlayStation 2 version comes bundled with the non-interactive Wesker Report, a nice little history of the series from a certain point of view. But most importantly, Code: Veronica X comes packed with a short playable demo of the mesmerizing Devil May Cry, which is more than worth the price of admission itself.   Story If you have played Resident Evil before, then you need no introductions to Resident Evil Code: Veronica X, a Dreamcast port that's more than 1 1/2 years ago. The story evolves as follows: Claire Redfield escapes from the devastating blast that levels Raccoon City at the end of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (yea!), and goes in search for her brother Chris, who's gone missing. Three months later, Claire cannot find her brother Chris, who, along with a few S.T.A.R.S. compatriots, was transferred to Europe to seek out the ~truth~ about Umbrella.   In search for him in Paris, Claire stumbles too close to the truth herself, and (after escaping a chain-gun happy helicopter and an entire regiment of soldiers) is clubbed, captured, and brought to a remote island that's strangely taken over by an unknown militia. From there, in tantalizingly, agonizingly tortuous fashion, Claire makes odd acquaintances with young rebel Steve Burnside (who is playable), and later finds her brother Chris (who also is playable), and takes on the entire village of zombies, worms, freaks, and mutants that come her way, until she learns who is responsible for the Veronica Virus, and then takes care of them. Of yeah, and lest I forget, evil Wesker reappears after a spell MIA (he wasn't around in RE2 and RE3), and appears to be as malevolent and megalomanacal as ever.   Without revealing any major spoilers, the story is an interesting depiction of the Ashford family that founded the chemical corporation Umbrella and their descent in sheer madness, psychological turmoil, and eventually nearly hilarious caricature form. But, like I said, the story is the best part of the game, and so I don't want to spoil it.   Gameplay What Code Veronica does differently than its predecessors in the gameplay department is slight at best. Unlike in Nemesis, in which the controls featured duckin/strafing and story branches, or tap the L1 button access the map, Code Veronica X is actually less evolved. Ducking/strafing and instant map access via the shoulder buttons are not available here. So, why take two good things away from a series whose controls are frustrating at best? I don't know. If anything, the controls should add at least one or two new abilities, not subtract them.   On the flip side, players can, however, walk up stairs in realtime, after the touch of a button. Weapons are used in the same way as before (R1+ action button), players can run, down on the Dpad+Circle is a 180 degree spin, and the rest is standard. So yes, in case you were wondering, the controls are classic Resident Evil.   Or should I say, the same clunky, slow, inaccurate, cumbersome, vein-bursting, infuriating controls that gamers have had to withstand for years. Oh yeah, and if the crows in the first few games didn't totally annoy the shorts off you, wait until you waste a bunch of ammo on the bats in Code: Veronica X. The entire idea of fighting flying enemies in this series is abnormal, and so to perpetuate the controls' failures by forcing gamers to aim at flying things in mid-air just points out their worst aspects.    What has seemed to get better is that the environments have evolved just an insy-winsy bit, to permit players to see just about everything they are going to fight without having to guess or hope from around a corner. These levels aren't perfect, but in many cases they are larger and ever so slightly better to fight in. The playable characters' heads also move to look at different objects, mostly enemies, and it's a nice touch. But I'll tell you this, even though Resident Evil is designed as a slow adventure, that doesn't mean its controls have to be slow and cumbersome. Also, if you've ever been attacked by a character off-screen, like you do in all Resident Evil games, you won't be happy with Code: Veronica X, which dishes out the same off-screen attacks. Once you play one minute of Devil May Cry (and yes, I know, it's an action game), you'll be pulling your hair out going back to Code: Veronica X.   So yeah, it's not good controls that Code Veronica X will be remembered for, it's bigger environments, cinematic CG, newer puzzles, and a two-disc set that's now contained on a single PS2 DVD. The game seems massive, bigger than before, and far more intricate. The Military facility and the Palace are just the beginning of the game, when you think about it. Players get to ride submarines and a couple different airplanes before the game moves on to Antarctica! In short, it's just much bigger than previous games in the series. How many hours did it take me? About 10 hours the first time through. That's a pretty good amount of time for an RE game.   In regard to the puzzles and the fetch-quests, well, there's not much to say. Some puzzles frustrated me, and it wasn't that I couldn't solve them (I did). It has to do with logistics. Some puzzles aren't meant for you to solve as Claire, they're meant for you to solve later as Chris. The big problem with this idea is that many players will look everywhere, search their maps, die, and lower their ammo inventories because they can't solve a puzzle that can't be solved, and the game doesn't clarify. So you could literally waste a good two hours trying to solve a puzzle, or find some wacky object like a banana pipe or a newfangled mop dispenser before you just give up. Then later when you're Chris, you may say, ~OHHHH..., Chris is supposed to do that.~ Ggrrrr....  All in all, the gameplay is formula-perfect Resident Evil, just on a grander scale. You fight virus-infected monsters, solve logic puzzles, fetch objects to open doors on the other side of the island, and get startled every-so-often. Love it or hate it, nothing much has changed.   Graphics It's clear that Capcom set out to create a more cinematic game, a movie-style game, more than it set out to revise the Resident Evil formula. In this respect, Capcom succeeded beautifully. For the first time in the four-plus-year series Code: Veronica X was created entirely from realtime polygonal structures with detailed texture-maps. With this new set-up in mind, the environments are more realistic, and create a feeling of cohesion between the player and the environment that's subtle, but that improves the visual and emotional quality of the game.   Although the game uses mostly in-game engine graphics during the cut-scenes, the CG here is just gorgeous. Close ups of the characters' faces and their eyes shows a good sense of human emotion, and the smooth-moving human models are a delight. The difference between the in-game graphics and the CG are noticeable, but they're so much closer than they ever have been on a console that instead of pointing out the differences between the two, the CG simply enhances the overall quality of the game. The CG is just like having three scoops of ice cream instead of two, it's all lovely extras.   Another excellent graphic feature in the game comes in the form of lighting. Everything is lit with exquisite detail. The contrast between dark and light is constantly revisited with realtime lighting of just about every element the Capcom team could think up. Players see flickering candles and lampshades, moonlight peering through giant open windows, and dozens of different scenarios that create subtle nuances, shades, and textures in the characters' looks.   Sound The first Resident Evil kind of set a strange tone for future games in the series. The game's voice acting was laughed at for years, and yes, perhaps the game's writers should also take some of the heat as well. In Code: Veronica X, players are able to enjoy much better voice acting than the series has ever heard. Sure, it's not perfect. Claire says Steve's name so many times in a moaning-porno kind of way, it's difficult sometimes to not just burst out laughing. Likewise, Steve has some corny lines and deliveries, while Chris is pretty much the straight man, not weird, not unusual, just there. All in all, the voice acting isn't bad by any means, but it isn't stunning, either.   Like many games with evil villains, perhaps the antagonists, Alfred and Alexia Ashford, get the best voice-acting roles. Alfred is a strange dude, to say the least, with a normal high voice that later transforms into a high-pitched near-female voice. Yes, he does a little switchover in this game, and he's exceptionally loathsome, so he does get the leeway to go over the top. And Wesker's voice job is also quite nice; his negative persistence is strangely likeable. Like I said, the voice acting in the Resident Evil series has come a long way.   When it comes to music, Code: Veronica X is great. The orchestral set-ups create a deep, disturbing environment, and the use of the trembling piano and the long, exaggerated use of the string section is impeccable. I particularly like the use of the piano in the Palace, wherein the music so reminiscent of the Exorcist, it's uncanny. What better movie to borrow from than that?In case you didn't get the thrust of my opinion in the opening paragraphs, I'm truly tired of this series, despite my love for the series overall. And for someone who truly likes Capcom's games, that's saying something. Even more of a personal statement is that when Code Veronica arrived on the Dreamcast, I never had the patience or interest level to play even 1/4 of the way through. Only now that I am forced to play it because of my job have I completed it. On the other hand, if you never felt that the controls or the fixed cameras or the fetch-quests were in any way troublesome, then well, I guess you'll love Resident Evil Code: Veronica X. But I have a hard time seeing that. The fact is, the game's storyline has always been its best trait, and so I played this game from beginning to end just to find out what happens. The story is great, the voice acting is credible, and the game's length will definitely fulfill you. You see, despite the fact that I'm bored to tears with the series doesn't mean that it's not a great adventure, it's just that after having played so many Resident Evil games, I want more from it. I want better controls, less ludicrous key-searching missions, and more forgiving camera angles, for starters. As adventure games go on the PlayStation 2 it's worth a look, but don't expect anything new or innovative.", "date": "Aug 27, 2001"}
