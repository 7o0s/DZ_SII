It was really only a matter of time before someone cranked out something based on this whole phenomenon, though it is interesting that it actually hit shelves after the supposed fall of mankind was going to take place.  It just so happens that the magical date came and went and the terrible bug, amazingly enough, did not blow up anyone's computer, knock any planes out of the sky, or put rust on anyone's car bumper.  However, if you can all promise to suspend a little disbelief here, I'll promise not to go off on a tirade about games whose titles include the words ~The Game.~  Our adventure begins with the main character, Buster, awakening on the morning of January 1, 2000 to discover his mansion going haywire from the illustrious Y2K bug.  According to the opening movie, Buster recently won the lottery and is enjoying a rather relaxed life at this point.  As far as backstory goes, that's about all you're going to get since the lack of a printed manual makes the opening movie the only source for information short of tracking down the CD manual on the second disc.  However, I must admit that though the plot is quite basic, it really doesn't need too much more than that.  Still, a printed instruction book would've been nice to have, if only for the pretty pictures.  Moving about the mansion is quite difficult at times due to the computer taking on an almost conscience desire to impede your every move.  Progressing through the different rooms of the house involves figuring out exactly what is wrong with that particular environment and then fixing the problem.  Sometimes the components you need for solving a problem are present in the room, other times they are not.  In the realm of gameplay for graphic adventures, this title obviously doesn't break out of the mold too much.  However, listening to the computer make wise cracks to Buster at various points, and witnessing just how screwed up things could have potentially been had the year 2000 brought with it the wrath that so many feared makes going through the game at least somewhat palatable.  The one thing that struck an odd chord in the experience was the truly bountiful number of objects that could be clicked on which performed absolutely no function whatsoever.  Many rooms are literally clogged with all kinds of wonderfully interesting objects (windows, samurai swords, etc.) which, upon being clicked on, yield nothing but the snide comments of our hero stating that ~there's no point, I'm not doing that.~  Granted, the designers probably had some time left over after coming up with the story to this game (computers going crazy in the year 2000...who would've ever guessed?), but I'm reasonably sure it could have been spent more productively than adding in an array of distracting frustrations such as these.  Looking around a bit I found the background artwork in this effort to be quite well done.  Every room I witnessed was well drawn with a believable atmosphere, and the option to view them in 360 degrees (sometimes from several different vantage points) was a definite plus.  However, the visuals are not without their ironies.  Though the environment was certainly attractive, the movement of the main character was less than satisfactory on some occasions.  A slumped over, choppy walk is his transportation method of choice, and even that is sometimes broken up by spatial glitches in the graphical display.  On a lower end system, this may be expected.  However, on a computer that more than triples the requirements of the game in most areas, it isn't very tolerable.  As far as blips and buzzes go, the music and sound effects present here are more than passable.  There is a constant eerie soundtrack playing in the background which, while at times sounding a bit too much like it belongs in a horror flick, compliments the scenes rather well.  We're not exactly talking Grammies here or anything, but it does the job.  Coupled with that are some effects which are pretty much dead on with what you would expect when hearing something in real life.  Creaking doors, tired footsteps, and a mess of computer and electrical fizzles make it at least sound like you are going through the motions with Buster the Rich.  So essentially what we have here is a rather mediocre graphic adventure that most fans of the genre should probably do without, at least until it makes its way down into the bargain bin.  When Y3K comes out in a thousand years, who knows, maybe it'll be worth a trip to the new release wall.  For now though, just wait until it finds its way to the cheapy pile.  Once there, Y2K: The Game (gosh that cracks me up) may be worth picking up if only to live out the nostalgic worries of what the bug could have conceivably brought to bear on society.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Mar 3, 2000"}
