Outnumbered beyond hope, the fighting folk are struggling day and night around here to get some sort of respect from their ball handling brethren. Occasionally though, we'll see an immigration of sorts... a changing of sides, as one guy from the other team will wander on over to the ~enemy~ and give his coveted game of choice a friendly round or two... or thirty.  Very few titles in either category however, can ever manage to hold the interest of the opposing side. ~Who wants to play Tekken when I've got NBA 2K sitting pretty right over there?~ they say. ~Screw you and your no muss, no fuss copy of Knockout Kings buddy, I have the import version of Capcom vs. SNK right here!~ they retort!  After awhile the bickering and boasting becomes pretty bothersome, and the desire to convince those who don't share your philosophy of gaming transforms into futility. That is however, until that one special game that grabs everyone's attention comes along. Be it shoto or cleat-face, it's multiplayer aspects are so good you forget about your petty differences and unite under one banner, all in the name of fun. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, NFL 2K1, and NBA 2K are but a few shining examples of such miracles in silicon form.  Another such example would have to be Midway's spanking new offering, NFL Blitz 2001. Standing side by side with an elite list of excellent games in that very exclusive club, Blitz 2001 is poised to become one of THE premiere party games yet available for Sega's Dreamcast. And while it may not be the end all, be all of Sega-played living room festivities, the fact remains that what we do get is a damn fine product.  Known to be the NBA Jam of the football world, Blitz takes most of the rules and regulations of the gridiron and hurdles them off a cliff. Placing first downs at the normally absurd distance of 30 yards, you can tell from the offset this isn't your father's football. Zany tackles, leaping clotheslines, and dog piles that turn adult film stars green with envy are commonplace in the hectic stratum of Blitz 2001, and man is it ever cool!  Most of the features are the ones we've seen before in previous incarnations of the series, and over the years we've already learned what to expect. Simple to throw passes, fiery turbo charges, and incredibly rough beat-downs are just as wacky as ever, with a healthy load of playbook choices and fumble follies thrown in for good measure. This year however, probably sees the largest list of additions in Blitz's illustrious (if short) history. From the top to the bottom, this is a bigger and better Blitz.  The most obvious improvement comes in the form of the visuals. Twice as lovely as last year's installment, Blitz 2001 appears to be nearly flawless. Seemingly more detailed than even the arcade version, the players increased polygon count is a blessing from the skies above. Smooth 60 frame action and killer lighting effects only enhance the package further, and the stylized stadiums which include metallic futuristic turf are studious additions.  Also impressive are the weather effects. Utilizing one of the more realistic snowflake machines I've ever seen, it is truly inspiring to sit back and watch the field become blanketed in a veil of white powder. Slowly engulfing the entire field as the game wears on, this type of attention to detail will make you smile. Other weather conditions like rain and fog are here too, and they are every bit as righteous as the blizzard effect. Hats off to you Midway!  Play calling is a lot easier than before as well. Much smoother in appearance and simpler to read when compared to last year's version, choosing the proper formation is the best I've seen (and that includes public darling NFL 2K1!). Further adding to the merry-go-round of joy is the inclusion of new stadiums, players, and modes with the single player in mind. Deeper than any version of Blitz before it, 2001 deserves a commendation.  But if you want to examine the real star of the show, turn your attention to the multiplayer experience. Be it two, three, or four gamesters pounding away at once, Blitz 2001 has enough action, laughter, and replayability for even the most discerning bastard out there. Plus the fact that you can save all your stats, teams, and created players to your VMU means that no matter there you go, you can always ball. And ball you will!  Sure to sell a zillion copies, NFL Blitz 2001 deserves all the attention it's going to get. A big improvement on an already entertaining game, Blitz 2001 is recommended for anyone who enjoys a hearty challenge, terrific graphics, and one of the more satisfying multiplayer experiences around. Check it out!  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC After playing way too much of arcade NFL Blitz, I must admit to being a huge addict of the coin-op and the concept of ~arcade football.~ So I was bound to love Blitz anyway. But Midway is still a felon of fudging its own ports, so this one was up in the air. The final verdict is that Midway nailed this on the head. PSX Blitz amazed us in look, speed, and playability without losing the speedy flair of the coin-op powered by a powerful PC engine and loads of RAM.There are little differences in this version. Gone is the foul-mouthed language (What the F@ck is going on?~), and a few other little rants. But new ones are in their place, such as ~With the circus catch~ when receiving a great pass, and ~And stay down~ after a massive tackle. New tackle animations appear as well, in addition to the fantastic pile driver, wind-up-and-throw, and gang tackles while players are down.The biggest differences occur in the camera perspective, passing game, and money plays. The camera is fixed much farther out than before, causing players to appear smaller, and probably keep the frame rate in the high 20s. That didn't bug me a bit. The passing game, however, is either not perfectly tested, or balanced out for gameplay. On short passes with the turbo depressed, quarterbacks overpass screens and hand-offs by 15 or so yards. This simply didn't happen in the coin-op. It's not that big of a deal, but when it counts later in the game, it can be frustrating to hurl a post pattern when you actually called a screen-pass. Finally, the overall gameplay is far more balanced than the arcade, so that money plays (right slants, splits, sub-zero, and super fly, among others) simply work as well. The AI is souped-up, just like a real football team, to adjust to too many of one play. This forces gamers to learn more plays and get better at the game.All in all, this is my favorite football game of the year. With the exception of Gran Turismo and Goldeneye 007, I haven't wasted this much time on a game in a long, long time.", "date": "Sep 15, 2000"}
