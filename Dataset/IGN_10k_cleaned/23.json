Safari Rescue Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/14/go-diego-go-safari-rescue-review", "text": "While there are a lot of games out there aimed at kids, there really aren't that many that can be played by the youngest children.  Three to eight-year-olds often have trouble figuring out the control and gameplay mechanics of even your Pokemons and your Nintendogs.  Go, Diego, Go! Safari Rescue caters to this set, with only the simplest gameplay, all-touch controls, and constant audio explanation of what is required.  Plus, it's a good use of the popular cartoon license and carries some decent production values.   You're probably familiar with Diego, the Dora the Explorer off-shoot who rescues animals and speaks a bit of Spanish.    Safari Rescue extends the feel of the cartoon and features the voice of Jake T. Austin, the main actor from the series.  The game alternates between overhead exploration and the simplest of mini-games.  These mini-games are impossible to fail.  Maybe you'll have to clear logs out of the way so you can cross a river on your elephant.  Or maybe Diego will have to go for a jog and dodge a few boulders.  Whatever it is, the game will just wait for you to make your move.  Many of these mini-games have groovy Latin music that I must admit had my head nodding.   The story is downright bizarre, involving a mosquito who lands on a magic wand and is turned into a magician. She decides she doesn't like elephants and turns them all into giant boulders. Diego and his posse find a magic drum to reverse the spell and must traverse the African expanse to set things right. It's the sort of adventure only the twisted mind of a four-year-old can really appreciate, I suppose.   The whole experience is very younger user-friendly.  You can turn the power off mid-game and Diego's exact location will be saved.  Diego is constantly telling the player exactly what needs to be done, what button to press, and where to go.  His movement is controlled with the D-pad, the stylus makes selections and drags objects, and occasionally the microphone is used in mini-games.   It's all very repetitive, though.  While this obviously isn't intended for sophisticated gamers, I think even the younger set will eventually tire of the ~walk around/take a picture/jump over a log~ formula.  There is only one game mode and no multiplayer.I have two little cousins, seven and four, who always want to play my videogames but they can't get a hang of the controls or concepts to most of them.  Go, Diego, Go! Safari Rescue is perfect for them.  It might be the easiest game I've ever played, but for once that's a good thing.  Younger gamers deserve a fun, engaging experience that developers have put some thought into.  Safari Rescue doesn't raise the bar for games as a medium, but any kid who enjoys the cartoon is going to like this game.  It aims to be a pleasant diversion for preschoolers, and to that end it is successful.", "date": "Mar 14, 2008"}
