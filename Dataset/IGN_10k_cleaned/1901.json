Lego Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge is a totally basic RPG-ish adventure on the Game Boy Color, but unfortunately when you pull out all the frills of the genre, you really see how weak the foundation can be. This game isn't terrible, it's just strictly average  and it's not for anyone over 12 years of age.  Dozens of cards to collect Infrared support to trade cards Battery save Only for Game Boy Color   Don't go looking for the original Lego Island -- this game's namesake comes from the PC title of the same name. It's a little confusing to jump right into a sequel when the original title was never released on the system, but that confusion is over when you see just how simplistic this Game Boy Color adventure game is -- you play as a pizza delivery boy who's been put to the task of bringing the escaped convict Brickster back to Jail (it was your fault he escaped). You'll have to wander all over Lego Island, solving puzzles in order to advance to the next area, trying to stay one step ahead of the Brickster.   The game may use the Lego branding, but that's only because the adventure takes place in the world of Legos  you won't be snapping together bricks and creating your own structures in Lego Island 2. What a shame, too, since the overall game is rather monotonous and uninteresting  the design is simply you playing delivery boy: if you can't access a certain area, it's because a character needs an item. The game's design is basically find an item, take it to the person that needs it, he'll reveal the next part of the adventure.   Oh yeah, and you can't die  ultimate proof that this game's for the young folk. This design addition causes more problems than anything, since in no way do you need to take it easy. Oh, you'll be chased by lego mummies and monsters, but all you have to do is bump into them and they'll go away. And if they don't, you simply shoot them with your pizza gun and they'll be stunned for a bit. There's no sense of conservation or defensive play anywhere in the game. You're more keeping away from enemies just for convenience sake.  The game board is huge, I'll give the game that. But trying to figure out where the jail, boathouse, information center or other necessary landmarks are, and the game really needs a map feature to pull up so kids can figure out where the heck they are and need to be. The only real design issue worth exploring is acquiring all the hidden Lego character cards tossed in remote locations all over the island. But even here, it's not that much of an incentive to keep wandering around. These cards aren't anything but basic Lego character artwork that you can trade with friends who have a copy of this game.     This adventure is strictly average, and if you're out of Elementary school then this title isn't for you. Young kids might get a bit more enjoyment out this game than I did, but I'm guessing they'll get just as tired from the tedious game design. Luckily it saves the game in progress every time you wander off the screen into another section of the island. It's very basic, and mildly amusing...middle of the road all the way.", "date": "Apr 16, 2001"}
