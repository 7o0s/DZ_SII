I remember saying something like, ~Man, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this one right... It's pretty hard writing about a soccer game without constantly using words like EA, FIFA or Live.~ I remember him telling me that I should focus on the title at hand, keeping in mind that I'm a game reviewer as well as a soccer fan, so I should broaden my electronic soccer horizons.  After that he roughed me up until I forgot the conversation.  Thanks goodness I wrote those opening sentences before he landed his first blows.  Needles to say, I thought I'd have a tough time not mentioning the name of EA Sports, but once I started playing the game I realized that those wacky British lads from Rage made my task easy. Microsoft International Soccer 2000 is a unique title, and it really doesn't deserve to be treated as a fading reflection of any of the soccer simulations/arcades out there. And in any case, the Birmingham developers should be given the benefit of the doubt. After all the English invented the bloody game, so they must know a few things about it, right?   In-Game Options and Interface  Looking at the game's range of options, menu navigation, and controls, I can't help thinking that the single guiding idea behind the pre game setup was to keep it all nice and simple!  Back and forward buttons enable browsing through menus, with the omni presence of the famous help, close and minimize buttons in the top right corner of the screen. You can access the in-game help at any time, close or minimize the application by clicking the appropriate buttons. You can also right click on the controller in order to set up some additional gameplay options. All this points to the fact that Microsoft had some say on the appearance of the game's interface. A fitting graphical background which is nothing too fancy but still highly functional allows for easy navigation.   The same story applies for the in-game options. There's nothing too innovative about them as they include some pretty standard features, but you can find everything you need for a solid soccer simulation in MS Soccer 2000. The player can choose to participate in a friendly match, load a preset match, join a competition, train, or start a classic match. One interesting thing about playing a classic match is that you have to complete the match objectives in order to move on to the subsequent games. Unlike standard matches, you can't change the game options before playing a classic. We should also note that the training mode is quite nicely done and informative. It covers in detail things like crosses, throw-ins, free kicks, etc. Several competitions are also featured in the game and you may choose from one of the following: International Cup, Euro Qualifiers, Euro Finals, Territories Cup, Knock Out, or League Play. League competitions are played in round robin-format whereby each team plays every other team twice  one game at home and one away. Once you've selected all of the options above, all that remains before you start is the pre-match setup screen. There you can finalize the settings with all the usual: weather, camera angle, stadium, duration, offside, and night/day selections.  The game controls themselves are also very simple and intuitive. Along with the directional keys, seven other keys play a major role during gameplay (if you use the keyboard). You have your standard ASD-QWE movement setup with the added bonus of the spacebar for closer ball control. Overall, the controls are easy to learn, and they shouldn't take more than half an hour of practice to get comfortable with.  Visual Impressions  The first thing I noticed during the initial stadium camera fly-by was how beautiful the sky textures look.  They are absolutely stunning and they are accompanied with occasional lens flares when the camera crossed the sun. Whether it's day or night, cloudy or sunny, the sky is one of the richest visual experiences the game has to offer. Along with the nice sky, the grass textures of the pitch look extremely realistic.  Unfortunately, the rest of the game's visuals fall somewhat below the standards of the two earlier mentioned. The stadium itself is solid, with just a slight lack of detail and more complex architecture that we're used to seeing.  Crowd animations are also a bit dodgy, but with some nice added touches like flaming torches (fire's always a common scene in major soccer matches) and waving flags. Although I must say the flags and torches are few and far apart, sticking out awkwardly from the crowd because of their relatively small numbers. The player models are solid, especially when using the far side camera, and while the polygon count is not exactly huge, overall they look on the level of something we've come to expect from the creators of Expendable and Incoming. The programmers didn't pay that much attention to their faces, which is a good thing really. Why increase the strain on the hardware because of a few fancy details not even noticeable during gameplay?  Plus it's worth mentioning that International Soccer suffered a rather serious setback before it even found its way onto our PCs by not having the backing of the FIFA organization. In other words, for some er... inexplicable reason (yeah right), Rage Software couldn't acquire the Federation of International Soccer Associations license, meaning that the names and faces of the players plus all the details regarding the official FIFA player statistics had to be left out of the game. Some people may find this to be rather annoying, although there is always the option of customizing the players, and their names for that matter, to your own liking.  When it comes to animations, MS International Soccer 2000 is a mixed bag.  While there is a lot of nicely done motion captured moves that the players show off during the game, the goal scoring celebrations fall well below my expectations, mainly because they tend to be repetitive and a bit unimaginative. But just because this one area is lacking doesn't mean the game doesn't stand on its two feet when it comes to visual acuity.  Generally speaking the game looks very good, with some cool graphics that will in no way bother you or lessen the experience of playing the game.  Gameplay, Rage Style  The most pleasant surprise of the game was the way that the gameplay flows. First of all, we should consider International Soccer an arcade type of a sports game. The difference between arcade-styles and simulations are pretty unclear these days, especially with sports games. In any case, MS Soccer gameplay is very addictive and most importantly a good deal of fun. Fine-tuning of the game's difficulty level and speed settings enhances the feel of the game even further.   One aspect where MSIS 2000 definitely excels is its phenomenal ball physics. Absolutely the most realistic interpretation of ball movement I've seen in any soccer game so far, including FIFA 2000. Depending on the angle and the way you hit it, the ball will curve and bounce in the most plausible way yet. It's incredible how much of an impact such a small detail can have on the overall feel of a game. I couldn't quite place right away what I liked so much about International Soccer's gameplay, but I realized later on that it had to do with the way the ball ~ran away~ from the players and deflected off with a curl.  It's simply amazing.  Because of the fantastic ball physics the passes feel great, and that helps a lot in making the midfield game seem more interesting.  Let's face it, most of the time in Soccer a team is trying to win over ball possession in the midfield. Controlling the midfield usually leads to some nice scoring opportunities in the penalty box, and making a good through pass is vital for your offensive game. This is a part of MS Soccer that really stands out from the rest of the pack. The programmers added the one-touch pass option where the computer actually predicts what you're trying to do even if the player you're controlling is not near the ball. Say I was sprinting to get to the ball and I already hit the pass key. The computer will direct the player to make the pass even if he is not in a position to do it right away. The player will pass the ball once he gets close enough to actually kick it and there is no need for you to repeatedly hit the pass key in order to re-issue the command. You can turn this feature on and off in the menu and, while it works wonders for the offensive flow of the game, it gets trickier to use it when it comes to playing defense.   This brings us to the most annoying part of the gameplay that really could have used some more work -- defensive tackling. There are two types of tackles in the game: the slide tackle and upright tackle. The upright tackle is supposed to be more of a reach in, scramble type of a defensive action, while the good old slide tackle is supposed to be the most effective defensive technique. Well, it doesn't work that way in the game. The upright tackle is woefully ineffective, and the sliding tackle draws way too many fouls. The principle of the game concerning fouls is that almost every slide tackle from behind represents a bootable offense, while the side tackles, and sometimes even the front tackles, will more often than not get called for a foul. Now, that wouldn't be that bad if the upright tackle was effective. Unfortunately, there is only a slight chance of winning over the ball possession by scrambling for it. In order to stop the other team's charging forward you'll be forced to use the sliding tackle, making the foul count on your team's sheet a rather silly one. Having so many breaks in the game ruins the flow somewhat, but after a bit of practice you just might bring the number of fouls to a reasonable level.   One other thing that can be considered unpleasant while on defense is the fact that once the opposing player gets to the penalty box, you can't even dream of any sliding. If you decide to use the sliding tackle, nine out of ten times the referee will point to the penalty spot, regardless if the tackle came from the front, side, or behind. Personally I would've liked to have seen more defensive options in the game. The fact is that by International soccer standards, every tackle from behind should be considered a bootable offense.  But the programmers should've given us a wider variety of options during the defensive phase of the game, or they could've just made the upright tackle more effective.   Another small annoyance is the lack of dribbling. Sure, you can hit spacebar for closer ball control, but that just isn't as exciting as dribbling past the defender.  All that remains to be covered gameplay-wise is the performance of the AI. The computer's artificial intelligence is respectable in the sense that you won't notice any obvious or unacceptable faults while playing. One thing that could be considered naive is the computer's poor defensive reaction when the attacking balance is shifted onto the wings. Instead of crossing the ball, sprinting straight to the goal line will work almost every time. It's the easiest way to score in the game. This is just a glitch really, and you'll be able to partly resolve the problem by upping the game's difficulty level. Increased defensive pressure will make it a bit harder to sprint pass the other team's defenders. A few other AI glitches I encountered include free kick taking where the AI will hit the wall because it sets the direction of the kick before you've finished setting up the wall, and penalty talking in which, for some reason, the AI cases decides to take the penalty shot straight down the middle most of the time.  All things considered though, the artificial intelligence is pretty solid aside from these few caveats.  In a Nutshell  MS International Soccer 2000 is definitely worth giving a kick around -- in a good way. If you are a fan of the game trying to break out from EA's hold on soccer titles, Rage Software's little baby just might be the right way to go. It's still suffering from growing pains, but given the right amount of feedback from the gaming community, some more funding, and a bit more time, the MS International Soccer series could very well turn out to be the first real competition to the EA FIFA powerhouse. My message to the boys over at Birmingham is call me up -- I'll be more than happy to try and contribute to the success of the sequel by being a beta tester, especially since it means I get to play the next game before anyone else. Given the right circumstances, you just might have a winning series on your hands lads!   -- Uros Jojic", "date": "Feb 29, 2000"}
