You had the celebrities; the over-the-top, cartoonish violence, and that intangible hip-vibe that only MTV could deliver with a hilarious approach to dialogue that's still uncommon today. One has to wonder, however, why the company waited five long years to finally release a videogame based on this popular franchise when it's expected that it would have done much better in its heyday. Besides, it's pretty apparent from the get-go that the wait wasn't spent to polish the gameplay.   Gameplay  Despite our ominous beginning, it isn't all bad: as you'll have the opportunity to play through three different episodes from the start and can unlock a couple more as you progress. Players can also compete in one-on-one matches against each other and choose from 15 of the most eclectic personalities on television. Carrot Top, Miss Cleo, Marilyn Manson, and Dennis Rodman are but a few of those that you can choose from and you can create your own fighter from scratch should those not appeal to you. But that's where the positive seems to end.   It first becomes obvious when it's discovered that players can zoom through a single match in about fifty to sixty seconds. By that same token, computer opponents are practically defenseless and the only thing gamers need to do is mash the buttons blindly to gain a victory. And while it's true that there are three different levels of attack in addition to a single special move, there's little need to use any of them. Where's the strategy or entertainment in that?   At least there's a little more variety in terms of the items, though. As weapons and temporary skill boosts randomly drop into the field during a battle. The selection here is pretty varied, with a chainsaw, blunderbuss, tennis ball shooter and a few other items at your disposal. Though truthfully, there's little need to use anything other than a character's bare hands. Especially since the inclusion of weapons makes the already short matches even quicker. The other special items are more appealing: with up health packs, speed boosts, armor upgrades available in every corner. At least with those, the matches will last more than a couple of seconds.   Graphics  Luckily, the show's trademark brutality and gore has remained intact. There's actually a large number of damage indicators such black eyes, busted lips, torn-up clothing, stab wounds, and various splatters of blood to illustrate the carnage effectively. You can really tell when you're kicking someone's ass -- and that's a good thing. Kicking and stomping your opponent viciously while they lay on the ground is particularly satisfying. Especially when you do so much damage that screen is sprayed with a seemingly endless supply of crimson.   Brief moment of happiness aside, the pleasure of blood is incomplete without an appropriate level of visual detail; and Celebrity Death Match fails to deliver. The models are extremely blocky and the textures themselves fail to impress. We're supposed to be in control of claymation action figures -- not plastic cartoons -- which is exactly the type of message the visuals here convey. At least the framerate isn't too bad and the colors (especially the red) are definitely vivid.   The Soundtrack For The Slaughter   ...~The soundtrack is all about the hard rock; with a few revved-up rap jams tossed in for extra fist waving goodness. The artists represented range from the likes of established acts such as Sevendust, The Eastsidaz, Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz, and The Yin Yang Twins to newcomers like Pay The Girl, Chyna Whyte, and The Kicks.~   Want to know more about the Celebrity Deathmatch soundtrack? Follow the link above to check out what editor Spence Abbott had to say about it on IGN Music    Sound  One of the aspects of CDM that bothered us the most, is that the dialogue has almost completely stripped of the funny celebrity quips. Johnny Gomez and Nick Diamond have a bunch of choice lines, (though they will repeat them often in a single fight), but the only thing that fighters get are opening and closing insults. Even the best lines don't approach the biting humor of the TV show. Tommy Lee says, ~I rule!~ at the end of a successful match -- and that's it. Where are the thousands of lines of dialogue that the front of the box claims is in there? Certainly not with the celebrities -- that's for sure.We can only imagine what Celebrity Deathmatch could have been if it was done with a larger budget and a more refined gameplay engine. But not only did it skip over the elements that make the TV show so memorable in terms of its presentation, but it wasn't much fun to play either. In short, CDM isn't worth your time in the least -- leave it in the bargain bins where you'll find it.", "date": "Oct 31, 2003"}
