If you didn't have an insane number of sets, then your neighbor or best friend did. Hell, my Dad loved playing with the things, and the beauty of them was that they allowed you to create different things each time, but usually within their little ~worlds~. For example, the space scenes were perfect for making ships, moon rovers, and other futuristic craft, while the town sets let you construct little cities. Despite 3DO's PR and marketing attempts, most of us DIDN'T play with army men when we were young, we were too busy building the most fantastic moon base in existence, only to have our little siblings destroy them.   I myself had about five cans of Royal Dansk sugar cookies that were filled to the brim with assorted Lego goodness, so it was with quite a bit of enthusiasm that I popped the CD into my PlayStation and impatiently waited for it to hum to life. What initially hit me was a fantastic CG intro that got me even more excited: perfectly modeled Lego racers burned rubber around tracks that seemed to feature all the essential elements of the Lego world. Everything was there, those great conical trees, slender rectangular bricks for powerups (which by the way, ended up delivering, but more on that later), and a great variety of those lovable Lego people, gunning their way to victory.   Lego Racers takes that childhood fun ingrained in us all, and tries to flesh it out into a digital format. The problem is, even for a kid's game, it's far too shallow to actually pass for 50 bucks worth of plastic disc. Whether this is because of the PlayStation's limited hardware, or an unwillingness to embellish on other parts of the game as much as the car and player design, only God will know. While the create-a-car mode is great (and I do stress great, it's literally like sorting through your Legos to build the perfect racer), the tracks that you're plopped down into are simply bland and are a complete eyesore.   The entire time I was playing this, I tried to keep in mind that this game is aimed at kids, not the older ~kids at heart~ that might pick it up for nostalgia's sake. Unfortunately, there are some glaring problems that will affect kids, and even more that will stop anyone older than five from playing on. What's worse, the truly detailed (and best parts of the game) are too complex for the intended age group.    Gameplay As I said before, the actual building of a Lego racer is fantastic. You can choose from all the major sets of Lego's we've come to love: space, forest, town, pirate, etc. After you've chosen your set, you pick from that set's blocks and plop them down onto your car via a 3D interface. The interface allows you to rotate the block, rotate the car, place blocks or remove them. All the normal Lego building rules apply; if there aren't enough spaces for that wing, it's not going to attach. After you've crafted your space-and-nub death dealing Lego racer of doom, you move on to create the license, but I'm getting ahead of myself.   Before you even create you car, you design the person who will be directing its course through the aforementioned blah levels of the race. You can choose from 50 different heads, legs, torsos, and helmets/hair to create the perfect driver, and all body parts are pulled from the sets I mentioned earlier. For example, my driver's body consisted of a surly-looking old man head, covered by a knight's helmet, but with a racing torso and robotic legs. If this much time had been spent creating slick track designs, Lego Racers might have had something to satisfy all ages. Instead its washed-up track designs are too simple for any older gamers, and the overly complex building scenarios will probably be underutilized by younger gamers.   Once you've created your driver and his vehicle, it's on to stamp your license, and then if you choose, race your new car around a test track littered with weapons. This is a great way to get a feel for your car's handling, acceleration, cornering, etc. (Not to mention how it looks in-game.)   Building aside, Lego Racers takes either your car or a pre-built one and plops them into a series of circuits to square your creations (or the computers if you're not into building your car) off against the computer opponents. Overall, the AI is good, so good in fact, that smaller, inexperienced racers may have a hard time even progressing past the first set of tracks, as the AI can be ruthless. Worst of all, the load times between levels is horrendous, and when little Timmy's Ritalin wears off, he'll be bouncing off the walls long before the level is ready for him to tear through (instead, he'll probably be tearing through your couch or something of considerably higher value).   However, there is one race feature that should be in EVERY weapons-based racer: upgradeable weapons. That's right. While there are only four different types of weapons (the standard shield, projectile, boost, and hazard), they can all be upgraded to much more advanced weapons via a white brick. The more white power bricks you collect (up to three), the more powerful and varied a weapon will become. For example, if I grab a red projectile brick, I'm rewarded with a simple cannon ball, but grab 1, 2, or 3 power bricks and I upgrade the weapons to a grappling hook, lightning wand, or 3 guided rockets, respectively. It's a fantastic system that rewards selective collection of weapons. The only drawback, however, is that just because you've picked up a power brick and a red brick, running over a yellow brick won't stop you from involuntarily switching over to that weapon, losing your previous power-ups. This forces you to spend too much time navigating around bricks just to keep the weapon you have.   Graphics As I said before, Lego Racers' graphics are not great. This game is best classified as a kart racer, so it must be judged by its racing peers. When held up against Naughty Dog's Crash Team Racing, LR just falls apart. It lacks the slick level designs or polished graphics, and with the exception of the great weapons system, lacks any real innovation. The track designs are mostly straightforward, with a shortcut or two thrown in, but the framerate and overall effects are spotty, and don't really deliver an experience that lives up to the design. It's a classic case of fantastic idea, but poor presentation.   I will admit that the Lego blocks, and the cars that are built from them, are modeled quite well. The whole idea of being able to create a vehicle from literally hundreds of different pieces is great, and the final result usually resembles what you've seen up-close, if lacking a little detail.   I can't help but think if this game was placed in the capable hands of Namco or even Psygnosis, we'd see a beautiful, as well as deep racer, but as it stands it's just an ugly duckling hiding a slightly entertaining experience. The textures, while somewhat varied, are much like the stuff we saw in third-generation games. They're grainy, overused, and are an eyesore. When are developers going to learn that they don't have to texture EVERYTHING just to make it look good? One look at Naughty Dog's work, or Square, or Namco, or even Insomniac, and you'll see developers that realized a properly lighted and shaded poly can look just as good surrounded by subtle textures as a fully-textured object.    Sound Lego Racer's effects were sampled at a low rate, it's obvious when you hear them. They lack crispness in the high end that you can only get with a high bitrate sound effect. (Why is it that such a simple game is the butt of a graphics and sound lesson? Who knows!) They're also very canned effects. They're simple booms for explosions, chirps and clinks for weapons pickups, and nothing more.   Likewise, the music is quite flat, and doesn't really go along with the music, the racers are screaming along at a pretty decent clip, yet the music suggests a happy, plucky Sunday joyride instead of an all-out dash to the finish line. It's not horrible, and it fits for the menus, but in the race, it just falls flat.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: great ideas, poor execution. Lego Racers COULD have been good, but because of long load times and mediocre track design, it's just an average game. Not a bad one, but not stellar by any means, either.", "date": "Mar 16, 2000"}
