{"name": "Nuclear Strike", "name_review": "Nuclear Strike", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/25/nuclear-strike-3", "text": "The Strike series from Electronic Arts is one of the best-loved and most enduring non-sports games series ever to appear on consoles. And, like it does every year,     EA always improves on the previous version by making the next one in the series sound better, look better, and play better.     Nuclear Strike is just another fine example of that.      The game is set in the jungles of Southeast Asia, where the player is given over 15 different vehicles to complete his mission. This means that     you're not confined to the air any longer.     Besides the choppers, you get to     crash through rivers and trees with a wide     variety of tanks, including an M-1 Abrams.     And if that doesn't appeal to you, a     hovercraft has been added as well.        Along with the huge parking lot of extra     vehicles, EA has also tuned the     graphics. The ground levels look extremely     cool and the explosion effects look like they     were taken straight out of a John Woo     movie.  However, at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike, only with better graphics and a wider variety of vehicles. Hopefully EA won't fall into the trap its sports division has, releasing the same game year after year with minor improvements. Nuclear Strike is receiving an 8 (one less than Soviet Strike) for just this reason. It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same. Nuclear Strike 64 is the sort of game that if you wanted, and had an ax to grind, you could probably nit pick to death. Sometimes the map is a little confusing with the use of light blue and dark blue and I didn't particularly like the fact that after you died, the game keeps running while your vehicle resurrects. There are probably a half a dozen other little things like that. However that is to take a small view and not the big picture. Nuclear Strike 64 is a good and challenging mission based game that continues a fine tradition in grand style. I don't think it'll win many awards or huge accolades. Its biggest selling point is that in addition to doing most things well it doesn't do anything badly. A rather solid effort.", "date": "Sep 25, 1997"}
