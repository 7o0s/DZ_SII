The game was originally scheduled for release during the Christmas holiday 2002, but certain issues (which could have something to do with the Xbox game being a terrible action game) kept this game from hitting shelves until recently. The delay obviously had nothing to do with the quality of the GBA production, because the portable Bruce Lee game is a really tight and solid action title that could redeem the tarnished Bruce Lee videogame legacy after what happened on the Xbox. Features More than a dozen different levels Hand-to-hand and weapon combat Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Bruce Lee: Return of the Legend is an original game design and storyline that puts players in the Bruce Lee role of Hai Fang, a martial arts student on a walkabout for revenge on his master's murder by the evil Yakan organization. For Bruce Lee's first adventure on the Game Boy Advance, Vivendi Universal went to Vicarious Visions, one of the most active GBA developers around. The team put together a versatile game design that mixes Double Dragon-esque brawler gameplay with Prince of Persia-style platform exploration, adding a little Splinter Cell stealth in for good measure.  Bruce has a lot of moves at his disposal; his large array of punch and kick attacks can pretty much take care of most of the mindless goons wandering the levels. But there are many places in the game where you'll have to take advantage of Bruce's more stunning martial art attacks, like a split kick that can take out enemies on either side of him, or an over the shoulder punch to nail a guy to his rear. There are weapon pick-ups for even more devastating hits...what Kung Fu movie wouldn't be complete without someone wielding a bamboo stick or some nunchuks? The fighting engine's solid and feels great thanks to tight collision detection; it offers satisfying feedback when players whack a few enemies grouped together.  But Kung Fu is only a part of the game. It's a majority of the game, sure, but players will also have to move through some large, segmented levels, climbing or kick-flipping up ledges and performing specific tasks to get to the exit; finding the right keys, for example...or rescuing hostages that are scattered all over the place. There are levels where stealth must be used; if an enemy spots Bruce, he'll have to start the level over. Luckily the screen zooms back so the player can see further ahead.  Players don't have to worry too much about losing lives; Bruce isn't invincible or anything, and it's easy to fail missions thanks to the difficult boss battles, tricky ledge jumping, and large assortment of enemies. But it's like a film...you get as many takes as necessary to get through the scene.  Many of these ideas were used in Vicarious Vision's other side-scrolling action game, X2: Wolverine's Revenge released a couple of months ago, but Bruce Lee was actually developed and completed even before the Wolverine project in mind. But even with that in mind, Bruce Lee feels more complete, tighter, and more versatile than Wolverine does, even though Wolverine's design is built upon Bruce Lee's engine and gameplay. Bruce Lee's had a pretty extensive videogame career, spanning from the Atari 2600 and Apple II days, to the SNES, Genesis, and even the Atari Jaguar, right up to a failed attempt on the Xbox. But Vivendi Universal's Game Boy Advance game could definitely be seen as the Kung Fu Master's best videogame adventure to date. The beat-em-up action and platform gameplay is extremely solid, with well designed levels and a decent challenge all the way through.  The stealth portions, like in Splinter Cell and X2: Wolverine's Revenge still seem out of place in a side-scroller, but they're not too disjointed in Bruce Lee. Don't let the crappy Xbox game scare you away from this really solid action title; it might be hard to find on shelves due to its reported limited release, but it's definitely worth tracking down.", "date": "May 31, 2003"}
