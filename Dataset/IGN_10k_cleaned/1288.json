The game has always been a favorite with its unique design, controls, and characters, and the Game Boy Color version of this Gottlieb  classic has all the original elements plus a few new additions to move the design forward. And like the update of Frogger, the new elements that have been added to Q*Bert fit the design perfectly and don't clutter up the gameplay  Q*Bert fanatics will find lots to like here. Features Classic and Adventure modes More than 40 levels Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Whatever the heck Q*Bert is, he's got a specific task set out in front of him  turn the surface of each cube the designated color. How? By simply hopping on them  he can jump up or down on any adjacent cube to maneuver through the network of boxes. But there's a hitch  enemies are abundant. Topping out the line-up of bad guys is a purple snake named Coily  he'll begin as a large purple ball that will fall down the cubes until he can go no further, and then he'll spring out and hunt Q*Bert down. He can only be outsmarted by Q*Bert if he hops onto spinning disks that will transport him to another part of the cube network  sending the poor snake to his doom off the structure. There are other objects and creatures that will try and put a stop to this puff-ball with a snorkel, including red balls and two characters (Ugg and Wrong Way) hopping along the other surfaces of the cubes with M.C Escher-esque mentality. Q*Bert can bite the big one by accidentally falling off the structure, or getting bonked by enemies.  It sounds complicated, but in all honesty it's as simple to pick up and play as Frogger is. And with the Game Boy Color version developed by Majesco, the classic single-screen game has now been upgraded  there are now dozens of different structures that will challenge you to think ahead. There will be a load of ~dead end~ pathways that you'll have to stomp through, taking the risk of being trapped by one of the enemies. Classic Q*Bert elements are still here  Slick and Sam, two annoying green fuzzballs, will pop up randomly and hop along the structure turning already-changed cubes back to their original color. New features include a power-up that will wipe all enemies off the screen, as well as tiny characters that will award an extra guy when caught. Levels will also increase in difficulty  not only will later levels require multiple stomps per cube, but some structures span multiple screens that are accessible through a teleporter cube. And each of these new elements still fit the overall Q*Bert design. The game is broken into two parts: arcade and adventure, but both are pretty much identical in gameplay  adventure's levels are just segmented into five different parts.  Because of Q*Bert's diagonal layout, you can play the game with two different control schemes  the default is ~diagonal,~ which means you simply push the controller in the direction you want to hop. The problem is, pushing a diagonal direction isn't as sensitive as a simple up, down, left, or right push on the D-pad, so you might find this way a little sluggish. I highly recommend the ~standard~ way, which changes your thinking  up on the d-pad is really upper-right, for example. It takes a second or two to pick it up, but it's the easier way to go.  The only real problem with Q*Bert is the fact that the graphics are nearly a one-to-one pixel conversion of the arcade game  which means the screen has to scroll to follow the action. It's difficult to stay three steps ahead of Coily when he's off-screen  and in the arcade version you could see him coming a mile away. And the password save is a little bit of a pain, especially when you have to write down a character string like ~J&RBTGBGP##~. Ugh.  I'll admit that I was never any good at the arcade version of Q*Bert, but I loved it just the same. Heck, I even played the crappy-looking Atari 2600 version to death , so I knew what to expect when I plugged in the Game Boy Color edition. Actually, I got a lot more than that  the designers built quite a few elements that actually fit the original idea very well, and didn't mess with anything that made the game a lot of fun and a unique challenge. I would have liked a zoomed-back option, even if the graphics might have taken a serious hit  it's almost necessary in Q*Bert to see everything at once. But with that in mind, Q*Bert is an excellent pick-up-and-play game for the Game Boy Color.", "date": "Sep 29, 2000"}
