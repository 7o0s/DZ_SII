We just finished up a marathon play session with Gameloft's new 3D edition of the bestselling action-adventure Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow on Sony's very slick K500i handset, capable of pushing some very respectable polygons. Now, we've already played a good deal of Splinter Cell on Game Boys, N-Gages, consoles, and handsets -- was it worth it to return to the same ground just for the visual overhaul?   Yes.   Features:   3D graphics  Multiple levels  Stealth gameplay   Several weeks back, we gushed over our playtest of Disney's upcoming 3D edition of Kingdom Hearts for the soon-to-be released LG VX8000 handset. Simply, we're nuts about the next evolution in cellphone gaming -- the big push for 3D. And, as expected, Gameloft is there with the kind of gotta-have games like Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow to make adopters take serious notice.   By now, we all know the story of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. Sam Fisher is a super-secret agent with a license to kill and a stomach steely enough to use it. He's been dropped into East Timor to thwart a mounting terrorist threat by a madman in possession of chemical weapons.   While the gameplay in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrowcertainly isn't all that different from earlier editions. Sam still must stick to shadows to slip by unsuspecting guards. He must stealthily sneak up on terrorists and quietly kill them with his silenced pistol or a neck-snapping move. Loud noises raise alarms that bring unwanted attention.   But the move to 3D enhances all of it. Sure, the visuals are thrilling enough on their own. The camera swoops around the action, showing up threat in the immediate vicinity. When Fisher grabs a guard from behind, the camera moves from a side-view to a three-quarters view so you can actually see his arm all the way around the guard's neck. And when you need to pay greater attention to your surroundings, the camera zooms in for a tighter view of Fisher.   But having that added dimension ups the stealth aspects of play, too. Before, shadowy patches were just dark spots on the map. Now, you can actually spy recessed alcoves that you can slide into and wait until a guard turns his back and strolls on by. When you must slip down to lower levels, you can actually see the drop-off so you can judge the amount of room to maneuver you have before ducking down.   Even without these enhancements, Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow still plays incredibly tight. The gunplay requires smarts, as you cannot just run into a hallway blasting. Sam has a limited number of bullets, and even though his pistol is quiet, trained guards still know the sound of a silencer. You must plan you method of attack, and leave as little evidence of your being there are possible.   Now, Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a little different than earlier editions. For example, you're dumped off directly into an industrial complex rather than the jungle outskirts of East Timor. The game seems shorter, too -- which was likely required because of the jump to 3D. Pumping those textures requires a little more memory than a 2D game.   But even if there is quantitatively less game, the quality is top-notch. The action is smart and the visuals are phenomenal for this early gen of 3D handsets. You'll be floored by some of the texture work, such as the shadow of moving fans on the ground. The backgrounds are a little muddy -- we're not at PSone quality yet -- but the mapping techniques are still nice. The camera work is smooth and player-friendly. And the animation of the small polygonal characters is extremely well done.Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a deliriously awesome game, even without 3D graphics. But this facelift sends Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow into the stratosphere. An incredibly playable game is made even more compelling thanks to an overhaul that is no mere gimmick, the 3D visuals often add to the gameplay, as in the case of shadow sequences. Gameloft has outdone itself with their new 3D game, and created a very compelling case for spending the extra scratch to upgrade to a new 3D-enabled handset. There will always be a massive market for traditional 2D games -- hey, I like a good game no matter how many dimensions it boasts -- but it's just so exciting to see where this arena is headed. Thanks for helping it along, Gameloft.", "date": "Dec 9, 2004"}
