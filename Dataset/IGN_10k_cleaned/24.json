So when we got a hold of Phenomedia's Chicken Hunter, we went into it with the same excitement we have when we're about to listen to oom-pah music. Unfortunately, Chicken Hunter was not a German delight like their wacky version of chocolate cake. It was, instead, a rotten egg.   Chicken Hunter is actually the German game, Moorhuhn. Over in Deutschland, Moorhuhn is wildly popular, spawning numerous sequels and spinoffs. There are Moorhuhn competitions online and the chicken has become a bit of an icon. We can't say what the appeal is exactly, but we suspect it stems from the sense of schadenfreude they get from killing chickens.   Chicken Hunter is a compilation of the Moorhuhn games, featuring a version of the classic shooter, as well as a few spinoffs: Weights, Gems, Spot the Difference, and Hotwire.   The Classic game is like duck hunt, but they added chickens and removed the fun. Players can scroll left and right on the panoramic farm scene and watch little rendered chickens walk or fly by. The object is to tap the chickens to shoot them, killing as many as possible in a minute and a half. There is only one level, and only one difficulty setting, which means that it takes a minute and a half to play this game completely.   See that background of the kart racing chicken? It never moves. Well, at least there are other games, right?   Like Weights, where the player has to shoot color coded weights at the matching chickens, trying to weigh them down enough to kill them. This game is even worse. At least Classic had the chickens occasionally popping up in humorous places, and reminded us of an amusement park shooting range. This one is just needlessly specific.   Gems is actually the most interesting game in the collection. Color coded chickens that drop gems fly above the level and players have to get them to drop the right gems to match a pattern displayed. It mixes a puzzle game with a shooting range fairly well and we found ourselves almost enjoying it. That is until the timer ran out and we realized there is only one level, thus ending any potential fun we might have had. Talk about a cock tease (Ha! Get it?).   Spot the Difference is exactly what it sounds like. Two images and the player finds the three differences. It's about as exciting as when this game is in the back of a Highlights magazine.   Hotwire is a kart... driving... thing. Players use the stylus to control the chicken as he races along a narrow road floating in the sky. The road gets increasingly windy and the speed progresses until the player crashes too much. The car is so tiny that the point of the stylus covers it up completely and the track is so boring that it's not worth playing long enough to crash three times.   Every game has the same uninspired ambient noise in it. Birds of various sorts chirp endlessly in every minigame. Sometimes, that's the only sound there is. Hotwire has no engine noises, no tires squealing, just birds chirping. Even the gunshots are drowned out by the tweets, which misses the entire point of ambient noise!   Stranger yet is the song that plays on the title screen. It's hard to make out the lyrics because the compression is so terrible, but it sounds like it's the tale of a tragic love between chicken and hunter. Maybe it got lost in translation, but we're not sure why the singer proclaims that he wants to see the subject ~eat off the ground.~ Whatever floats your boat...Chicken Hunter isn't a game. It's five game demos that Mumbo Jumbo is trying to get suckers to pay for. Playing through every single game takes approximately 15 minutes (at most) and then there is nothing to do. No multiplayer. No hard mode. Nothing. There's just so little content here, which makes the overall lack of quality even more insulting. If the developers were going to make a game with barely any content, they could have at least made it good content.", "date": "Mar 14, 2008"}
