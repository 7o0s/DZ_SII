There are side-scrolling hits like Gradius III and R-Type. There are vertically-scrolling choices like Xevious and Super Star Soldier. And then there's Axelay, which offers a bit of the best of both worlds.   Because Axelay is both a side-scrolling shooter and a vertically-scrolling one. The style of play alternates back and forth between levels, so you never stay in the same design for longer than the length of a single stage. And it's a refreshing balance. Whereas almost all other games in the genre pick one perspective and stick with it for the full length of the adventure, this one mixes things up and keeps you engaged.   Unfortunately, it's not for very long. Axelay's full length of adventure is only six stages, giving you three apiece of side-scroll and three more of flying straight up. For as refreshing as the swapping styles are, you'll certainly want there to just be more content in the end  the day is saved far too soon.   Axelay's vertically-scrolling stages make use of an interesting Mode 7 effect.  Now the side-scrolling stages aren't all that impressive, from a visual standpoint. Your ship, the Axelay, flies constantly to the right side of the screen and encounters a variety of enemies, while parallax backgrounds pass by in the distance. Fairly standard fare, especially here on the VC. Interestingly, though, the stages that scroll vertically employ a unique technique for bringing enemies and objects onto the screen. Rather than just descend from the top edge of your TV, the foes and environment sort of ~roll~ into view from the horizon.   It's a use of the SNES hardware's buzzword ~Mode 7~ capability, and it's really kind of odd to see in action again here in 2007. The technique is meant to simulate a 3D kind of graphics perspective, but it doesn't come off nearly as well as it first did in the early '90s  it's almost like the backgrounds your ship flies to encounter are appearing on the surface of a kitchen rolling pin, and being rotated up into view until they end up looking flat and normal. You get used to it. It's not like it's any kind of negative that effects the gameplay. It's just kind of weird to see.   Axelay's method of upgrading your ship is also distinctive, in that you won't find yourself awash in a swarm of different power-up items to choose between in the middle of stages. Your key choices for how to equip your ship happen instead between each level, where you get to pick and choose from a handful of different options  and your selection grows larger the further you get into the game. Your mighty craft is also resistant to immediate destruction, and is capable of taking more than one hit before falling out of the sky  enemy fire that collides with the Axelay will first downgrade its weapons to weaker versions, and it's only when you're hit again, after that downgrade, that you'll lose a life.   Longtime shooter fans, especially Konami-brand shooter fans, will no doubt notice the similarities between Axelay and an earlier effort from the same team that came to the NES  Life Force. It also alternated back and forth between side-scrolling and vertical levels, and it's easy to see how it probably served as inspiration for Axelay during development. Life Force fans shouldn't get too excited, though, because while Axelay is a good game and is certainly worth a look and possible download, it isn't up to the same level as its spiritual predecessor. There's no two-player co-op mode here, for one thing, and the power-up system is much less satisfying (Life Force used the more fun and focused upgrade progression from the Gradius series).So, again, Axelay's a bit of the best of both worlds. It's a solid shooter, and offers diversity of play through its swapping perspectives between stages. But, at the same time, Konami's own Life Force did that earlier, and did it better. The positives and negatives average out to ~good~ overall, as Axelay takes it place among the vast wealth of other scrolling shooters also available for the VC. Better that there are too many than not enough, right? Because if you're in the market for a shooter, the Wii Shop is the right market to be in.", "date": "Nov 28, 2007"}
