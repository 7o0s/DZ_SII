Nightclub Empire is one of those out-of-nowhere pleasures, a mobile game that takes an established game play genre -- in this case, sims -- and reshapes the experience for mobile consumption. Of course, it helps that the game is graced by an exceptionally well-implemented theme. Running a nightclub is something imagined by anybody who has sat in a bar and figure they could do better, and in Nightclub Empire you have your chance.   As a budding nightclub impresario, you start out with a little joint that's hardly moving. You have a fat bank account to get things started, and the level of customization you are offered right away is what really hooks you. From the get-go, you can buy speakers, lights, a new dance floor, hire a bouncer, and employ a DJ. There is no ~build~ period for any of these adjustments -- the moment you select an improvement, like a disco ball, it automatically appears.   The better you run your club, the more popularity and money you generate. Popularity is measured by little stars in the upper-right corner of the screen. It's important to keep track of, because increased popularity will unlock additional items to buy from the store. Money, of course, is what really keeps the game going. Everything you do has an effect on how fast cash comes through the door. You're always earning cash, but if you find the right combination of club features, you will see your profits quickly soar. This is certainly satisfying, as not only is it an indicator of success, but it allows you to keep stocking the scene with new gear.   You cannot just sit still in Nightclub Empire, though. The clubs you own (there are eventually three of them) require constant supervision, as the clientele is finicky, to say the least. First, you have to get bodies through the door -- and keep them coming. This is done through advertising, such as fliers or TV commercials, special events, as well as hiring professional dancers to entertain. Second, you have to dress the place up with lights such as a massive three-tiered wall display or a tall flashing tower. Finally, you have to keep track of what kind of patrons you attract, and then hire a DJ that will keep them happy.   There are several different DJs in the game, and each DJ plays a style of music that appeals to certain customers. You need to look at the clothing and style of your customers to discern their musical tastes. See a bunch of white jumpsuits and butterfly collars? Hire the disco DJ. Does it look like the clerks of Forever 21 stepped in for a spell? Hire the teeny-bopper DJs to play bubblegum. Bunch of skinny hipsters in zipper-up running jackets standing around? Hire the house DJ to lay down some deep beats. When you play the right music, the patrons will start jumping into the air and smiley faces note approval. Depending on the size of your dance floor, you'll see more patrons of the same ilk join in the fun. But it doesn't remain that way for long. You'll soon see a new style of patron join that dance floor -- maybe punksters will shoo away the reggae lovers. In that case, it's time to hire the punk DJ that looks like he just stepped out of Green Day concert.   In addition to musical maintenance, you have to watch out for trouble. If you do not have a bouncer near the door, fights may break out on the dance floor, which really bums the rest of the guests. Hiring a bouncer right away will dispel the brawlers and people will jump for joy again. You also can run afoul of bad luck. An earthquake may break some of your more delicate equipment. A malfunction may ruin something else. And you never know when misfortune will strike. I installed a lava tower in the corner once, only to have it fry minutes later. That was some expensive gear, and the loss cost me dearly.   Should you ever run into money woes, there is a little DJ mini-game in Nightclub Empire to help you generate some extra scratch by, well, scratching. In this timed game, you try to drop the needle on a record over money and multiplier icons. If you hit a bomb, you lose all your earned cash, but can keep trying for as long as the timer lasts. You may earn only 50 bucks. Some games, I earned $1200 or more.   In several ways, Nightclub Empire reminds me of Gameloft's successful Sim-esque New York Nights, which took the essence of a social simulator and distilled the experience for mobile play. Nightclub Empire does the same thing to PC games like Mall Tycoon, stripping away layers of interface that work fine with a mouse, but would be cumbersome on a handset.   The amount of content is slightly simplified, too, but not ravaged. Instead, DChoc not only took a look at what would be essential to a nightclub sim game, but also made sure that your tweaks weren't minor changes with little in-your-face reverberation. Immediate gratification is one of the most important factors of a successful mobile game; if you're going to only play for four minutes, you want something to happen, you want a sense of accomplish or entertainment -- or, even better, both. This is why you select DJs and light fixtures -- things that make an immediate impact (both visual and game play-wise) -- rather than sit there and goof with drink prices for a bar in hopes of eking out an extra three hundred bucks that week.   Nightclub Empire looks and sounds great. The different music clips for each DJ are original compositions, but they perfectly convey the music style of the DJ. A couple of them deserve to be ringtones (which would have been a cool reward). The club patron and DJ sprites are decently detailed so you can immediately tell what they are into. Each character has their own individual animations, such as the punk DJ that throws up the horns every once in a while. Nice touch. And the different club scenes get incredibly colorful and busy when you start installing mondo equipment.  Nightclub Empire is a stellar mobile game -- just good entertainment that offers immediate satisfaction for quick gaming sessions or deeper gratification for extended sessions, which I found myself doing through the weekend. I love sim games -- I still cannot shake my Civilization IV obsession -- and I love that Nightclub Empire gives me a taste of that genre without having to juggle a bazillion different things. Not that Nightclub Empire is shallow -- it's not. It's accessible, which makes all the difference. If you want a mobile game you can chew on for several weeks (maybe even longer), Nightclub Empire offers a substantial return on investment.", "date": "Mar 1, 2006"}
