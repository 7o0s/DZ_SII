While some are more simmy than others, they generally feature vehicles on an enclosed track.  Some, like Gran Turisimo, offer vehicle customization.  Others, like the magnificent Rallisport Challenge, have tracks running through countrysides and deserts.  Most racing games feel very standard, with only a few truly able to stand out from the pack.  THQ's Moto GP feels like a familiar racer, but once you spend a few hours with it, it's easy to see the depth which places it above the standard racing title.  Features  Licensed bikes and riders Ten of the most famous race tracks in the world Comprehensive training mode Season and arcade modes let you play your type of racing game Weather effects and races in the morning, at dusk, and at night Plenty of unlockables, including various filters Split-screen or system link play available  Gameplay Moto GP features both arcade and simulation modes, so fans of either type of racer can enjoy the game.  In the arcade mode, you'll be popping wheelies and performing burnouts to earn points.  Various riders and unlockables can be opened by scoring points in arcade mode.  However, not everything can be unlocked through arcade mode.  Tracks, movies, new leathers (what your biker wears), and bikes are unlocked by completing the training and doing well in the Grand Prix Championship, which is the sim aspect of the game.  Each rider's abilities are measured by four stats: Cornering, braking, top speed, and acceleration.  The GP Championship requires you to create your own rider and distribute ten stat points among the four stats.  Though your stats are very low at first, they can be raised by completing the five training missions for each attribute.  Points are also earned depending on your finishing position in each of the ten Grand Prix races.  Names show above the other riders during a grand prix race, which may seem a bit pointless at first, but when you are on the eighth or ninth race and you know one specific guy still has more total points than you, it'll be helpful to see his name as he passes you by.  Winning a race unlocks a video clip highlight of the real-life race.  There are three levels of difficulty for the GP Championship and winning each will unlock something new.  Pretty lighting makes it all good.  The controls for Moto GP are simple.  The left thumbstick steers, A accelerates, B causes you to look over your shoulder to look behind you, and the triggers control front and rear braking, just like on a regular motorcycle.  For anyone who have ridden a motorcycle, the controls feel fairly realistic, at least more natural than in previous moto racers.  In order to excel at the high difficulty levels, it's crucial to learn how to drive, brake, and turn properly.  These things are taught in the excellent training mode.  The game isn't nearly as daunting as Gran Turisimo 2 in terms of the need for precise execution.  While the races can get tough and the last of the training missions can be difficult, there's nothing that can't be accomplished with practice and repetition.  The bike is easy to steer, and it's a snap to pop wheelies and perform endos.  With those solid controls comes a heck of a lot of fun.  Tracks are twisting and will require some memorization so you'll know how fast to take certain turns.  Even when you're far ahead of the other racers, Moto GP is enjoyable.  It seems simple, just a bike on a track, but making good turns, avoiding road rash, and pulling up for a wheelie as you cross the finish line are all incredibly rewarding.  Moto GP includes several different camera angles for racing.  The standard 3rd-person behind the rider view is most comfortable, but the daring few may want to try the view behind the windshield.  There are also various control settings so you can find just the right control for your gameplay.  And best of all is the massive level of customization.  Not only are there over a dozen bikes and leathers to choose from, but there are 160 different colors to choose from to make your leathers and bike match your racing personality.  I went with a pink bike with flower decals, of course!    Online Moto GP is a fantastic single-player game and the addition of online play is merely sugar sprinkled on top of an apple pie.  Perhaps the most unique online experience currently available on Xbox Live, there's nothing quite like turning a corner with fifteen other riders on your tail.  If this is the future of online racing, sign me up.  Moto GP features all of the Xbox Live staples, including the friends list and optimatch options.  Any maps unlocked in the single player can be played online as well.  The Live starter kit comes with a demo of Moto GP, but the full game is the real way to go.  With scarcely any lag, it's quiet a stunning experience.  The only problem comes with too many people dropping out of games after trailing following the first lap.  If there were better ways to make users away of how often someone dropped from a race, the experience would be even better.  Graphics It seemed unlikely another game as pretty as Rallisport Challenge would hit Xbox so soon, but Moto GP is nearly the equal of Microsoft's rally racer.  The bump mapping, lighting, and textures are fantastic with the road looking so realistic it almost seems unnatural.  The sky ranges from a brilliant blue, to the deep red hue of dusk, to the dark grey clouds of a thunderstorm.  When it pours, you'll know it.  Drops of rain hit the camera and in the distance the clouds flash with lightning.  It's impressive to see the dirty tires get cleaned off by the rain, to pass by skid marks you left on your last lap, and to see dirt kicked up by your tires when you ride off the track.  But it's not just the bikes that are animated in Moto GP.  Riders grip the handlebars, squeeze the brakes, looks over their shoulder, and even shake an angry fist when they're cut off.  All of this can be seen in-game or during the replays.  The level of detail in Moto GP, the lighting and the bump-mapping are jaw-dropping.  Unfortunately, the very nature of the game (being on a closed track) makes the visuals a little less attractive than Rallisport Challenge.  This is still one of the finest looking games you will see on Xbox or any other console, but maybe next time there will be some off-road tracks to unlock so we can see the real majesty of mother nature.  Sound Utilizing 5.1, Moto GP is a nice-sounding racer, though it's nothing groundbreaking.  You'll notice a slight change in sound when you switch camera views, so you can hear a bit more when you are in a 3rd-person perspective than when in the cockpit view.  Other riders whiz by and you hear them on either rear speaker as they approach and pass you by.  When you near the spectator sections of the track, the crowd will rise and then quickly disappear as you pass by.  Probably most effective is boom of thunder, which dominates the sound field.  The motorcycles in Moto GP are whiny little kids.  That whine can get a little grating over time, but it isn't too terrible.  It's just the nature of a moto game, but motorcycles don't have nearly as appealing as sound as cars.    The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but is a sufficient racing score.  Fortunately you have no obligation to listen to the supplied tracks as Moto GP supports customized soundtracks.  This should be a requirement of every racing game out there.  My bad! Moto GP is another fine addition to the Xbox racing library.  While it doesn't offer the varied tracks of Rallisport Challenge, Moto GP does any racing fan proud.  Filled with stunning lighting effects and several modes of play, this will help fill those lonely summer hours when few games are out there.  Not only are there a ton of licensed riders to play as, but you can create your own racer as well.  Plenty to come back for and plenty to enjoy. Add to this the ability to go online with fifteen other racers and Moto GP is a real winner.", "date": "Jun 3, 2002"}
