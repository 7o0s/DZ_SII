Strange new worlds are colonized, and that means you have the opportunity to make a few bucks.  This is the world of Legacy Online, where a strange new world is your chance to start a business empire and amass a fortune.  From running the neighborhood drugstore to running an entire planet, this game gives you the opportunity to do it all.  That is, if you have the business skills needed.  What I really liked about this game from the start is that there's no box to buy, you can download the game for free.  You get a two-week free trial before you have to pay, and then the monthly fee is less then most MMO games out there these days.   When first learning about this game I was reminded of the perennial gaming classic SimCity, and that impression does have a little merit.  Legacy Online is like SimCity on steroids, meaning those with experience with SimCity should be very comfortable in this game.  But even those who have never touched a city/economy simulation game should be able to catch on fairly quickly.  Don't let your initial impressions fool you though, this game has far more depth then just placing a building and hoping people use it.   Your first step in building your business empire is to choose which planet you will start on.  The only real difference between planets is the number of players on each one.  This is nice because it means that people won't be flocking to specific planets to get an advantage, meaning you can base your decision on if you want to compete against just a few people, or a large number of people.  It would be nice if they sorted the world list by population size, but at least you can get that info when you click on the world.   Next you are given a $100 million loan and told to start your first company.  There are several different types of companies you can start, each with their own specialties.  What's nice about Legacy Online is that when you choose a company you aren't locked into that choice forever.  You can have more then one company running as you play, which is pretty much necessary if you want to advance.  There's even one type of company that you can't even open until you reach a certain level of success.     When first logging in to your new home on whichever planet you've chosen you get to choose which city you want to begin building in.  You're not locked into building only in that city, but it's a good idea to choose your starting city carefully because that's where you'll start building your base of power.  The game gives you the info you need to make an educated choice and you can begin the path toward ruling the world.  Getting to know some of the controls and how to use them can be a bit confusing at first, but most controls are fairly easy to figure out.   The game does start you out with a tutorial that is incredibly detailed.  It walks you through all the basics of getting your first company up and running and making you a profit.  From placing your first small business, to founding your first company headquarters, and even opening your first import and export warehouses, the tutorial makes sure you're ready to start the game.  This puts Legacy Online above many online games already.  And though the tutorial does lack some information as far as the later parts of the game, for instance how the political aspect really works, you can find much of that information on their official website, which you can access from within the game itself.   As far as how running your businesses, the level of detail can be as complex as you want it.  You can mess with everything from where you buy supplies and how much you pay your employees, to how much you will charge your customers.  You can draw customers in with low prices, taking a loss, then jack the prices up once they are loyal and gouge them for a profit.  Or you can keep the prices low but skimp on the quality by buying low-grade supplies form cheap sources.  The ability is there for you to play the game in whatever way is best suited to you.    The political side of the game has its ups and downs, but it mirrors real life politics in some very realistic ways.  As soon as a player earns enough prestige points in the game, it's possible to run for mayor.  The prestige means a new player can't immediately decide to run for Mayor, which is a good thing.  But this is a mixed blessing, as it's possible to earn the required amount of prestige fairly quickly, meaning some truly inexperienced players could still manage to slip through, as in real life.  But if they do they will most likely not be re-elected, so it's not a permanent problem.  Running for President takes much more prestige then Mayor, meaning the candidates are generally of a better quality as far as experience with the game goes.  Mayors run the individual towns, but the President runs the whole planet and can appoint people to Ministry positions, such as Minister of Education or Transportation.  Just like in the real world the system can breed corruption, but a truly savvy player can still find a way to turn a profit.  And perhaps some day they'll be able to take over and undo the damage that was done.   One aspect of the game that I really like is the way voting works.  Each player with a building in the city that turned a profit, in the case of a Mayoral election, gets a vote.  That's because it means you've paid taxes in that city.  For the Presidential election anyone with a company on that planet gets a vote, even if they aren't turning a profit.  When a player announces their candidacy, for Mayor for instance, they are required to fill out a form stating their campaign promises. This is where you promise to improve different things in the city if you are elected, like fire and police stations, health services, etc. In each case, you state a target percentage, with 100% being perfect, for each of the areas of public concern that you will be in charge of once you become Mayor. The election's results will, in part, depend on the promises that you make at this stage.  This is because the election isn't just one player gets one vote, and the candidate with the most number of those votes wins.  Instead the winner is based on who earns the most points, with points being calculated with a formula that takes into account your prestige points, the number of votes received, and the average percentage of the promises on your campaign promises.  And this official listing of campaign promises means that if you don't fulfill them, or at least try your best, you don't stand much chance of being re-elected.     One of the main aspects of running a successful company is research.  Your company has the ability to research different items to improve business, and each company type has access to some research that other company types don't.  This research ranges from learning how to build on water or construct warehouses, to how to improve food production at a food processing plant or adding a dartboard and pool table to your bars to attract more customers.  Researching can be risky though.  Some research requires the purchase of a special license.  And each license you buy increases the cost of the next one.  Eventually, if you're not careful, you could bankrupt yourself on licensing fees alone and be forced to sit out for a while waiting for your business to make enough money to pay off the debt.  Or you'll be forced to take out a loan from the bank, and the more you borrow the higher the interest will be.  Another danger to research is how it will affect your business.  Each item can affect such things as how desirable customers find your business, how efficient the business is, and how much prestige you gain from that research.  Some items may make your business more efficient, but make it less desirable to customers and hurt your prestige in the business world.  You have to balance the cost and benefit of each research item and be sure it caters to the vision you have for your company.   Besides good management of research there are several things that you need to take into account to truly make your empire successful.  The first is where you get your supplies.  You can buy from other players, or you can start your own businesses to make those supplies, and if you do that you can then sell your supplies to other players as well if you wish to.  There's also the salary you pay to your employees.  There are three types: Executives, Management, and your Low-Class Workers.  There is a minimum wage for each type that's established by the Mayor of the city.  You can pay the minimum and have a higher profit margin but have a harder time finding workers, pay way above the minimum and attract plenty of workers but have a lower profit margin, or you can try for a happy medium.  Finally you can change the price of your goods.  If the price is high you'll have trouble selling your goods, but if the business is desirable enough and the product of high enough quality you might be able to attract High-class customers who are willing to pay more for that quality and service.  It all depends on what kind of neighborhood you're in and how many of the same type of business is in the area.  You can find out this information through in game maps displaying such info and can make an educated decision.    This game is also extremely friendly to the casual gamers out there.  Since it's a persistent world your companies keep on running and making you money even if you're not logged in.  This means you're able to log in for 20 minutes here, an hour there, and play the game competitively.  You can log in, check your Profit and Loss report, and make any adjustments that need to be made.  You can place some new buildings, upgrade existing ones, or let it all ride.  Whatever it is that you feel you want to do that day, you can do and still be able to make progress.  Of course those who wish to play for hours on end will be able to advance more quickly, but not to the point where they really have a significant advantage over others.  This is because there's a built in time-sink to advancement that everyone has to adhere to.  In order to advance to the next business level you have to meet certain requirements.  Then, once you've met those requirements you have to wait until the end of the year in game time before you advance.  This helps slow down the pace of the power gamers without making it unreasonably tedious, while still allowing the casual gamer to advance at a steady pace.   I know much of this sounds nice, but not really competitive.  For those who are looking for a true sense of competition Legacy Online provides you with the Tournament world.  Legacy Online will be hosting a series of tournaments, with prizes for the winners.  The winner is determined by who has the highest average rankings in all categories that are tracked in the game.  This includes everything from how much money you have and how much prestige you've obtained, to how many lots of land you own and how much research you've done.  The winner of the first tournament, which just concluded, was awarded with the prize of being able to name the new planet that was being added to Legacy Online.  Future winners will receive other prizes, giving the truly competitive gamers out there a chance to really show what they're able to do.    Overall I was very impressed with this game.  Although at first a player may be tempted to write it off as an online clone of SimCity that impression couldn't be more untrue.  A player who logs in to Legacy Online soon will find themselves immersed in a game that will challenge their ability to form a winning strategy and run a successful company.  This game may not be for everyone out there, but anyone who enjoys a good simulation or strategy game should find plenty to entertain them in the game.  And even if you don't think it's your kind of game, with a free download of the client and a two-week trial it can't hurt to try it out.  You might be pleasantly surprised.", "date": "Aug 20, 2003"}
