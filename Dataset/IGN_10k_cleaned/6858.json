The latest popcorn flick to get the mobile treatment is Poseidon. The Warner Bros. movie is a remake of the 1972 disaster film ~The Poseidon Adventure,~ which starred Gene Hackman and the late (but very great) Shelley Winters. The updated cast includes Josh Lucas and the always dependable Kurt Russell, although none of the actors' likeness really appear in the mobile game.   The game opens with a mild cinematic, as we see snippets of characters musing about what the future may hold as the clock counts down to midnight. The New Year, however, is not rung in with champagne and casual sex, but a massive tidal wave that rolls the ship upside-down. Many are killed immediately, and it almost appears as if they are the lucky ones. The survivors must somehow climb through the wreckage of the overturned vessel and find a way to escape impending doom -- a ship turned over like this does not stay afloat for very long.   One of the things that struck me right away about Poseidon was the sheer amount of death everywhere. There are dead bodies slumped against walls or propped in corners. Even more grisly, as the ship starts to fill with water, limp bodies bob in the waves. For example, a woman in a cocktail dress lays face-down in the water, her arms dangling straight down, as if she is pointing to where she is afraid of going in the afterlife. There is a movement underfoot in mobile to shy away from death, crime, and any hint of realistic violence. I'm glad Poseidon squeaked out before such a voluntary plan was implemented, as seeing dead bodies everywhere conveys just how dire the situation is for the survivors.   Sadly, despite my initial interest, Poseidon turns out to be a very basic, paint-by-numbers adventure game. You play a couple characters from the movie -- a stalwart hero and a small child. You must run through the overturned ship (which means doors are on the ceiling and staircases that went up now go down), collect items to overcome obstacles and rescue other trapped survivors. Use axes to bash through crates, fire extinguishers to put out flames, pry bars to open doors and sealed passages, and flashlights to see in dark chambers. Very rudimentary adventure gaming staples -- and while Poseidon doesn't fail to deliver on competent game play, it does little to go beyond what's barely acceptable. With such a promising plot and a great setting, I found myself wondering what maybe Gameloft or I-play might have done with the material.   There is a map screen that helps you find your way through the ship, not entirely unlike a Castlevania game. The ship layout is fairly well thought out, with all the necessary items for getting through hazards placed far enough away from the related obstacle to prove a minor challenge.   Control is pretty intuitive. Time is always of the essence in the game, so you must run a lot. If you double-tap to the left or right, your hero runs. If you just press left or right, the hero walks slowly - but after three steps, breaks into a run. This is helpful for when you need to inch up a fire. Jumping is pretty context-sensitive, as is picking up and using items.   I played Poseidon on my Sony Ericsson 710. The game looks pretty good -- but not great. The ship design is kinda bare in some areas, and after seeing the trailer several times, I was hoping to get a real look at an ornate cruise liner turned into a living hell. The character sprites are decent sized. The particle effects of using the fire extinguisher are a nice touch. The animations are okay, but there is a standout moment when you run down stairs. Because the ship is overturned, the actual steps are facing downward. The animation of the character trying to negotiate essentially a diagonal plank looks realistic.  Poseidon is decent. Not good, but decent. The set-up is fantastic, which is why the cookie-cutter gameplay is such a disappointment. The game has some pretty solid atmosphere (those dead bodies really are effective), but it never lives up to it. Maybe if you're really into the movie after seeing it, you might want to give the game a download, but there are so many other better adventure games that deserve your money. As far as summer movie games go, this is a step up from The Da Vinci Code, but let's wait and see what else the season holds before committing our money.", "date": "Apr 24, 2006"}
