Virtual citizens just must not be doing a very good job taking care of their pets themselves, because it's been up to players to heal the sick in games like Paws & Claws: Pet Vet, Petz Wild Animals: Dolphinz and Puppy Luv: Spa and Resort. But as a new entry into this beginning-to-get-crowded genre, Imagine: Animal Doctor manages to set itself apart. It puts a stronger focus on the process of diagnosis first, and then addresses recovery care. It's a hook that works, and makes this title worth a look.   You play this time as Sally, a young woman who's just starting up her own veterinarian practice. But she's not alone  she's also got her brother Eric, her grandmother and her grandfather all on the corporate payroll. Each of the family members is in place to help out in his or her own way, so that Sally can focus on getting the diagnoses and treatment plans right for the pet patients that come in to the practice. You'll also get to manage the business, make development decisions and have some hands-on time with recovering animals, but the initial diagnosis is the real draw here.   There are 14 different mini-games associated with just that phase of the game, and it's these that are Imagine: Animal Doctor's most notable and compelling aspect. You'll guide a stethoscope over the surface of an animal's skin with the stylus, blow into the DS mic to reveal hidden fleas before tapping them on the touch screen to grab and remove them for study, and even guide an endoscope through a 3D representation of the inside of an animal's esophagus.    If you'd like an extra laugh, try switching the language option. All of your customers will start speaking French.  None of the brief designs is all that complicated. And some of them are perhaps a bit too simple, like repeatedly pressing a button on the touch screen to get a scale to measure an animal's weight correctly. But, taken as a whole, the diagnosis games are interesting enough to give Animal Doctor a bit of individual personality.   The game loses some steam after you finish the first examination of each animal, though. Extended care for recovering creatures feels a little too slow-paced, and you might be disheartened to see an animal not making progress toward reaching full health again. There's only so much you can do, too  you can pet them, which sometimes helps; make sure their food and water is filled up, which only takes two seconds; or play with them, which doesn't often seem to affect their stats in either a positive or negative direction.   There's no maintenance of the facilities to do, as that task is handed off to non-player character Eric to accomplish. You just talk to him when things have gotten too dirty, and he takes care of it. And there's no real construction to consider when expanding your hospital, because Sally's grandpa does that  you just pick the upgrade you want and he finishes installing it or building it in an instant.   Imagine: Animal Doctor offers up a unique bit of connectivity to another DS title, providing a link from the Imagine games over to Ubisoft's other multi-title series, Petz. If you have a copy of Petz: Horsez 2, you can trade horses and foals back and forth between the titles. The animals will migrate ownership from Sally, in this game, to Ginger, the main character in Horsez 2. It's not an amazing feature, but certainly a novel curiosity and something that owners of both games will want to try out at least once or twice.   But even with a feature like that, horses aren't the real prize-winning animals in the end  here, it's pigs. Virtual pet piglets. There have been plenty of games to offer ponies, puppies, kittens and even sea creatures before, but Imagine: Animal Doctor may be the first game where you can diagnose, treat and then look after digital hogs. It may seem like a silly thing to get excited about, but anything unique that other, previous titles haven't done yet is something worth noting in this genre on DS.And in the end, Imagine: Animal Doctor has just enough of those new, notable features to be worth looking into for fans of the virtual pet/simulation category of DS titles. Its early emphasis on diagnosing animals' afflictions is welcome, as other, similar games in the past have more often just blown past that part of the patient care process  here, it turns out to be the most fun phase. And while the extended care sequences afterward are a bit more of a chore, those gamers used to this style of title already know how to have patience with their patients. If that describes you, or if that describes someone you're buying games for this holiday season, keep an eye out for this one.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
