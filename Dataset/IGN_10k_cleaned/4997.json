So it has been and so it shall be and so it is in Capcom's new game, Monster Hunter. Players begin as young warriors who scratch around for herbs and grow into their glorious role to take down entire dragons and save the world from herb-eating dragons. It's a noble idea, and one that takes flight when the game goes online for banding together, but one that drags its feet a little when played solo.   For each different world in Monster Hunter there is a hub town to eat, sleep, and get new missions from the townsfolk. Starting out in the game, new players have nothing more than a basic weapon, some money, and underwear. After getting equipped with some clothes it's a matter of getting a quest from the elder of the town. This is important since the only way to go out into the rough world is to have a quest. It's disappointing that there is no ability to freely roam around the countryside and explore, but since the world gets rearranged for the different quests, this is a necessity.   The action in Monster Hunter starts off slow with some basic quests to fish, hunt for herbs, and cooking meat, but this does eventually lead into some real goals to finish with bigger critters to take down for the good of humanity. Some RPG elements come into place with better weapons and armor to purchase or trade for as well as picking up plenty of items to use, but pretty quickly the single-player experience trickles down to a big arrow pointing at the only real direction that the game can go: online.   With no exception, the gameplay here is designed for the online experience. While it's possible to take on a few of the quests solo, so many of them absolutely require one, if not two or three, other people backing you up in order to pull them off. With one quest asking for a huge egg to be brought back to the town without breaking it, trying this out with one person is an exercise in futility and testing out just how strong one's controller is against a hardwood floor. All in all, playing single-player feels like playing a board game all alone. Sure, it's possible to do it, but it's so obvious that that's not the way it was meant to be. And it's just sad.    So once the move is made to go online, everything about the game begins to make sense. The quests that at first appeared to be completely unbalanced begin to take form when four people (the largest size) can go out and support each other. Melee fighters can partner with some archers for a combination that helps to take down monsters even faster. Even better, one group can cause a distraction or even run some defense while the other group goes in for the kill, both literally or metaphorically.    With text chat enabled with a USB keyboard, that is absolutely essential, the game takes off when players can communicate about the different tasks they're working on or even taking care of some strategy. The biggest problem is that there is no voice chat since so many of the battles require some quick communication and even having a keyboard is often too slow for comfort.  During some of the battles a common conversation would include one party member shouting ~help!,~ followed by the rest of us trying to figure out where the person was. It was usually too late for the partner and they lost a life, only to be regenerated back at the town to run all the way back into battle.     After playing online for a while, the appeal of the game quickly becomes obvious as a good setup for a group internet adventure. That last sentence reads dirty, but it's clean, kids. The only problem is that the quest requirements can be both a pro and a con at the same time. While it's fun to have a quest and heave-ho out the door you go with some new buds, there will still be plenty of times when players go on quests they've already done just for the hell of it or they need to get some new items out in the world in order to upgrade their weapons.    The weapons here can be purchased, but there are also many different ways they can be upgraded and the items required can only be found out in the field. When it comes time to do the treadmill aspects of the game, there's a glaring omission of a world that can just be explored for the hell of it. It's as if players read through a book's chapters over and over again rather than making up the story for themselves. With so many restrictions on the overall gameplay, the game loses a certain amount of fluidity that helps to make it come alive.   For what it is as a mission-based online RPG, Monster Hunter makes its own niche and sits tidy in its place, but it's still an awkward position to be in. Where is the ability to really create a mission and go off on a created adventure? Where is the ability to have a different experience in the single-player game? All in all, the game is a machine made for one purpose only and that hurts the overall appeal.   When in the quests themselves the saving grace is that these missions, for the most part, go off without a hitch. Moving around the large levels is quick and easy without any lag that affects the outcome, even with all four people playing at once. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. For example, hunters can purchase pickaxes in town in order to chip away at cracks in a rock wall to find some hidden items. Even better, all of these missions are bite-sized with most of them lasting only half an hour.     Monster Hunter is an odd beast all its own with a mission-based structure that can provide comfort with its strict regulations if you don't mind the lack of an open world. It's almost like playing Everquest, but with only small areas around the town open for exploration and combat. If the idea of pursuing a variety of quests, some of them multiple times, then this provides a good amount of variety and character growth to make it interesting. Otherwise, the overall structure of the game feels like it's been awkwardly put in place for a single purpose and trying to go in different directions creates problems that it's unable to handle. It's interesting, and a bit frustrating, to see a game with such a unique devotion to a single type of play.", "date": "Sep 20, 2004"}
