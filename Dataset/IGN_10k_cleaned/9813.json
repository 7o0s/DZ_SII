Once you were simply the day before Friday but then came Seinfeld, Smallville, The Office and -- most recently -- PlayStation Network updates. Each week we Sony nerds get all amped up for the latest round of downloadable content, and each week Sony pumps out a handful of demos, trailers, themes and games. If those games sink or swim comes down to a complex equation that takes into account the game's price tag, amount of fun and suckage.   Let's see how Toy Home -- a Sixaxis-based driving game -- fared in the IGN analysis.    Not familiar with the latest PSN game? Toy Home gives you the choice of two Matchbox-esque cars and has you run them through the everyday, cluttered environments you'd find in your house. The goal of a single-player run in Toy Home is simple enough: make it through all of the brightly colored checkpoints before time runs out. However, there are a ton of nuances poured on from there. Throughout the game's eight courses are coins that give you bonus points, turbo medals that give you the juice to boost and special medals that give you extra points and time by pulling off mini-tasks or just ramming into a shiny object.     See, colliding with the stuff that's tossed about in Toy Home is a good thing. There are a number of obstacles that pop up in your would-be racetrack -- blocks, army men, blueberry jelly, etc. -- but rather than be hindrances, these objects become bonus points. As I tore around the multicolored carpet in the game's frist course -- Playground -- a bowling pin arrangement of red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink blocks stood in front of me. I tilted the controller right, slammed on the powerbrake, pulled off a nifty fishtail and drifted into the blocks. The game announced the moves as ~Super!~ and ~Cowabunga!~ and those compliments then filled two spots on a bar beneath the time remaining. When the six slots in that bar get filled, seconds are added to the time remaining.   Want more bar-filling action? A similar meter on the left side of the screen tracks the number of turbo boosts you have left -- you get the speedy power-ups over time or by hitting the turbo medals.    Anyway, all those coins, special medals and seconds remaining are added up at the end of your run and used to give you a rank and total score and you can even save your replays to reminisce later on. The best part about these scores? Toy Home features a Ranking Mode where you can go in and see the best scores for each course -- as well as replays of the runs that banked the points -- and then challenge those entries for your own shot at glory.   They won't come back from Deadman's Curve. All of this works fairly well -- it's fun shooting across paper towel bridges and turboing a soccer ball into a net -- but what stands out for me is the color and interactivity of Toy Home. The levels pop with plush carpet and children's animal blocks. Even everyday stuff such as forks and books get snazzed up while everything stands at the ready to topple over if nailed by a car. The environment truly feels destructible.    Sadly, those moments of fun are just that -- moments. To play the single-player portion of Toy Home, you need to sit down and play the eight tracks in order. You can't skip to your favorite track and you can't save your progress. You need to play all the courses to the end to unlock upgrades for your cars -- and this eight-part, repeating battle makes everything run together after awhile. Toy Home is pretty and fun at first, but after your sixth time through the third level, the beauty of it all will have worn off and how many times can you chase the same pink circles?   Multiplayer doesn't add much to the game's value either. There's one game mode called Battle for both local and online game, and it has you and one other opponent racing around a course trying to pick up the most coins. You can ram your opponent to make'em cough up their gold or launch crayon missiles as well as other items as attacks, but the mode is severely lacking. Locally, it's just not that much fun to drive around these huge environments looking for another tiny car, and online, this is the most lag I have experienced in any PS3 game.      I tried to have several online battles today, but apparently the world wasn't up for playing. The first match I did find ran like someone was flashing a strobe light on it, and the round crashed before we could determine a winner. In my second game, I saw the same choppiness with a different opponent but was able to pull off the win. Although I've never had a connection problem before, I double checked with a few message boards to see if other Toy Homers were having this lag problem.   They are.   Finally -- and I hate to give the Greg Miller Conspiracy Theorists more ammo for their claims that I hate tilt controls -- I wasn't thrilled with the Sixaxis implementation here. For the most part, it is responsive when you're slamming your car through bowling pins and launching it off of ramps, but when I needed to make precise moves to clip a checkpoint with my back bumper or fly down a narrow path without falling to my death, I found the tilt controls were far too imprecise. There is no option to use the analog sticks.So, how much do you value ten dollars? Sure, Toy Home is pretty at times, has a nice leaderboard option and is fun to tear through, but you'll have seen all the eight courses have to offer after your first run. That leaves you to complain about the game's two cars, repetitive gameplay and laggy online battle mode. To me, Toy Home is fun for a while but not worth my Hamilton.", "date": "Jan 5, 2008"}
