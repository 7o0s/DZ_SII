New World Computing and 3DO are doing the same thingbut in reverse. They've taken a jewel in the Heroes of Might & Magic (HOMM) series and attempted to squeeze every dime of profit out of it that they can, producing three games, several add-ons, and seemingly infinite repackaging of the series. Now the latest iteration is here, in the first Heroes Chronicles spin-off, Warlords of the Wasteland. Is it good? Is it bad? Should you even care? First a bit of background about this new set of Heroes games.    This first chronicle is one of four that are going to be released over the next couple of months. These are designed to be introductory games for the Heroes series and are aimeds at new players more so than veteran HOMM fans. They use the HOMM3 engine, and in fact are indistinguishable from that game for the most part. They're not dumbed down, but rather are a bit easier to play and emerge victorious, and there's a good tutorial included as well as hints that pop up as you play.   The four Chronicles follow a hero named Tarnum who must earn redemption from the gods by completing a series of quests. This is the overarching storyline. The gameplay is turn-based and requires you to manage city growth, resources, and armies. You fight quick tactical battles with fantastic creatures such as wolf-riders, mummies, vampires, and many more under your command.  The Chronicles are composed of eight scenarios that tell a story that's more cohesive than we've seen in the other Heroes games, but it's not the stuff of great fiction. The scenarios are all shorter than we typically received in the previous Heroes games, and account for no more than 15-25 hours of play. Plus there's no editor or multiplayer options, so once you complete the scenarios, there's not much replay value besides trying them again on a harder difficulty setting.  In the first Chronicle, Tarnum discovers an outlawed bard and hears for the first time of the long forgotten greatness of his enslaved people. This inspires him to lead a rebellion to overthrow the wizard kings who rule his people. The story, which includes carrying Tarnum forward into each of the scenarios, along with one or more of the best heroes under his command, includes twists such as having to rescue the four remaining bards within three months before they are executed, Tarnum having to conquer rival gnoll and lizardmen kingdoms to strengthen his own position, having to fight his way through the heavily fortified Wallpeak mountain passes only to find that he's walked into a trap in the following scenario, Tarnum's rage against all users of magic, and finally his battle with the Wizard-Kings whom have been pushed back to the very shores of the ocean. It's a good story, good enough to propel the game forward, though it's not as good as stories we've seen in games like Starcraft and Myth.  So what we have here is a short new campaign based on one of the better game series we've seen over the last five years with an interesting storyline for a price of around $20. That's the good. The bad is that for your $20, you're not getting much of anything new. If you're a veteran player, you're better off downloading user-made maps and playing for free. Given 3DO's propensity for creating as many packaging permutations as possible, you're undoubtedly going to see all four Chronicles packaged together at some point at a nicer price. Instead of spending $80 to get all four, you can probably wait six to twelve months and get them for a fraction of that price. There just isn't enough new material in this Chronicle to justify the purchase if you're not a rabid HOMM fan who has to have everything.   If you've never tried the HOMM series and don't want to bother downloading a demo, taking a look at this first Chronicle may be appealing. It is a bit easier to play and understand since the difficulty ramps up slowly over the eight scenarios. The gameplay is still the marvelous HOMM experience we've come to know and love over the years, and $20 is the price of taking a date to the movies and buying popcorn, so you're not out that much. Still, even if you find yourself curious about this acclaimed strategy game series, for $29.95 you can grab the newly released Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete which contains the original game Restoration of Erathia, the expansion pack: Armageddon's Blade and the stand-alone expansion Shadow of Death. There's probably between 100 and 200 hours of gameplay here, along with an editor for making your own scenarios, a random map generator, and multiplayer options. It's a far better deal than the Chronicles.   In the end, I wish that New World and 3DO had included a little more value into Warlords of the Wasteland. I like their approach to make the game a bit easier for new players to approach, and the more tightly knit, story-driven scenarios are welcome too. It's just a little too light on the amount of gameplay included to recommend to veteran HOMM fans.   -- Mark Asher      Want to share your opinions with the world?
