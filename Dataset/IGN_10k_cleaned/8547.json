Arguably superior to any other side-scrolling beat-'em-up to come from the same era, SoR2 debuted in 1992 on the Genesis and was honored as an instant classic by the Sega fan faithful. Its arrival now on the Wii Virtual Console further solidifies its status  15 years have passed, but the design has held up perfectly and it's just as fun today as it was back then. If you're a fan of thrashing punks on sidewalks, wielding steel pipes, bashing arcade machines and working side-by-side with a like-minded friend, Streets of Rage 2 could be the best way possible for you to spend 800 Wii Points.   The city is in trouble. One year has passed since the events of the original Streets of Rage, and once again criminal mastermind Mr. X has risen from the shadows and sent his masses of maniacal minions loose across town. He's out for revenge, and the game opens with heroes Axel and Blaze finding out that fellow SoR1 fighter Adam has been kidnapped by X's men. Taking his place in the playable roster are two new bruisers  Adam's younger, rollerblading brother Skate, and massive, muscular wrestler Max.        Streets of Rage 2's selection screen offers welcome variety, as Axel, Blaze, Skate and Max all fight with their own distinct styles. Skate is fast but weak, Max is strong but slow, and Blaze and Axel are the more well-rounded choices. Each character has his or her own special moves, too  a new addition for this sequel. The first Streets of Rage simply offered a summonable drive-by police car that would clear the screen with a barrage of heavy ammo. That feature's gone here, replaced by stronger fighting techniques in each of the individual fighters. Using them will drain your life bar, though, so it's wise to balance them out with the more basic punches and kicks.   Life bars for enemies make an appearance for the first time, as do enemy names  neither feature was present in SoR1. It's likely that the addition was made in response to Capcom's Final Fight, the closest competing beat-'em-up franchise that was active on the SNES at the same time as this series was headlining the genre for Genesis. And really, a lot of the appeal for Streets of Rage 2 comes by way of comparison. Against its own prequel, and against Final Fight. It took elements from both and executed them better.   And none so important as its two-player co-operative mode. The SNES version of Final Fight just hit the Wii VC two weeks ago. A solid game, and definitely worth consideration for download  but it drops the ball with multiplayer. It's just not there. Final Fight was compromised from its original arcade version when it came to home consoles, and two-player co-op got the axe. Not so here, in Streets of Rage 2. This one offers a great two-player co-op mode, and no compromises at all  as a game built from the ground up just for the Genesis hardware, there's no way to complain about any cutbacks or removals here. This is unedited, unerring, un-watered down. This is the definitive Streets of Rage.  Streets of Rage 2 has been one of the most wanted titles for the VC's Genesis line-up since the launch of the Wii. It's obvious why  the game is a blast. Played co-operatively or just by yourself, SoR2 is a great beat-'em-up experience and one of the best Genesis titles ever made. It's a highly recommended download, and takes its place near the top of the Sega Virtual Console crop  only the excessively explosive Gunstar Heroes outranks it at the moment.", "date": "May 29, 2007"}
