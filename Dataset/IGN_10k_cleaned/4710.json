That seem a little subjective, but when it comes down to it, what defines a videogame's worth more than that? Believe me, it's fun.  OK, I'm the first to admit Robo Pit isn't the best game ever. Nor does it break any boundaries or ~push the envelope,~ so to speak. What it does do is let you kick the $#!+ out of silly, cutesy robots, and then steal their arms. If that's not cool, I don't know what is. The graphics are a little plain, especially the combat fields, but the robot design is interesting and usually pretty weird - there's everything from crab robots to Doreamon-like guys.  The one-player mode tends to get a little monotonous, what with 100 robots to fight, but the two-player mode is where Robo Pit really shines. It's your standard split screen fare, and while this isn't too distracting, a link option would've been nice. Unfortunately, you can't take your opponent's arms as a victory prize as in the one-player, but you can save your best robots on the Memory Card and then fight with those. Overall, a really fun game. (Can I say ~fun~ a few more times?)", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
