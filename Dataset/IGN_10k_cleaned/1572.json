Little offerings from even tinier development teams that proved successful in the arcades and then went on to enjoy home console success. You know the ones -- everything from Pac-Man to Galaga, from Joust to Spy Hunter: the classics.   Thankfully giant games publisher Midway Home Entertainment has not turned its back on the past as it looks to the future. The company has contracted development house Digital Eclipse, best known for a series of great Game Boy titles, to give Nintendo 64 owners the chance to reminisce in the form of Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1. The title, a compilation of classics including Spy Hunter, Robotron, Joust, Defender, Sinistar and Rootbeer Tapper, emulates all of the timeless gems on Nintendo's 64-bit console. All these hits of yesteryear are playable in full, though a little rough around the edges in a few particular cases.  The Facts   Economy $29.95 cartridge Play six great Midway classics including: Spy Hunter, Joust, Defender, Robotron, Sinistar and Rootbeer Tapper Arcade Trivia 3D interface makes navigation, er, easy? Analog support Two-player support Save to Controller Pak   Gameplay Midways Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 is brought together via a horribly prepared 3D interface that tries to simulate a giant arcade room and fails. Everything about the interface, from it's slow, clunky movement, to the poorly rendered arcade machines and pre-first-generation graphic backgrounds, is sub-par. But chances are the interface probably isn't what you're interested in and true enough, it ultimately doesn't matter.  If you're still reading this review then you're obviously looking for some old-school entertainment on your Nintendo 64. The good news for you is that you really couldn't find a better selection than you have here in Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1. There is a good chance you've already played most of the offerings below, so we won't bother to provide in-depth hands-on for any of them. Instead, we'll sum up the play mechanics of each title, and then offer an opinion of how well they have translated to Nintendo 64.   Defender It's a simple concept. You are a lone spaceship deployed to protect the earth from a relentless army of alien beings intent of kidnapping humans. The play mechanics are equally simple: scroll right or left, up and down, shooting moving spaceships as they try to scoop up humans.  Translation: Intact. Looks and plays exactly like the original. Oddly, though, there is some noticeable slowdown with lots of explosions or when too many enemies are on-screen -- a baffling development to be sure, as Nintendo 64 should have no problem at all handling Defender.   Joust Wipe out enemies as you ride a giant ostrich. The action takes place on one static background that never shifts position or scrolls. A series of platforms serve as landing spots for your bird, and the object of the game is to land on your winged opponents, knocking out their eggs and collecting them. It's a strangely addictive, though admittedly wacky process.  Translation: Perfect. Plays great. Looks identical to the original. You can't really ask for more.  Spy Hunter Your classic weapon-based racer, Spy Hunter pits you as -- well, a spy, who races against time and enemies through a never-ending supply of frontward-scrolling stages. Foes are intent on knocking you off the road, so you must use both your wits and a variety of gadgets, from gunfire to oil slicks, to make sure they don't get the best of you. The action is fast and extraordinarily well paced.  Translation: Good, but not spectacular. The look and feel of the original game is perfectly intact, but like in Defender, there is a noticeable amount of slowdown in certain areas -- an alarming amount of slowdown in this particular game, in fact. It begs the question: why? On a brighter note, Nintendo 64 owners can accelerate and decelerate with the analog stick now.   Robotron Save the last human family from a legion of never-ending robot attackers. This classic title has already been reborn on Nintendo 64 courtesy of developer Player 1. Use your character to shoot up, down, left, right and diagonal and take out enemies.   Translation: Spot on. The look and feel is identical to the original, and you can use the C buttons to shoot in different directions (a combination of two fires diagonally).  Sinistar You and your ship are mankind's last hope against the evil Sinistar. What this means in this classic shooter is that you must go around space blowing up asteroids and collecting their parts before it's too late. It's one of the more addictive titles on the compilation to be sure.  Translation: Identical. Feels and looks exactly as the original did.   Rootbeer Tapper The idea is simple enough -- you are the Rootbeer Tapper, and your job is to serve up frosty brews to customers. The patrons of the game are spread across multiple tables, and when their glasses go empty you must refill them.   Translation: In tact. Plays and looks just like the original did. You will be hooked.  Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 also features a recommended Arcade Trivia mode, in which you can test your knowledge of the above six games in an ongoing quiz session. The answers are delivered through multiple choice -- one through three. You'll get questions such as, ~When a player reaches 990,000 points on Defender, what happens?~ and ~What bug was discovered and fixed after the first Joust machines were shipped?~ The Trivia is nearly as fun as the games presented in this compilation and is definitely suggested for those who consider themselves old-school game scholars. I've got a few gripes with this compilation of classic Midway hits. First, the presentation -- it's just awful. A horribly put together 3D interface and, save for a really fun Trivia Mode, not much else to offer in addition to the games themselves. But worse, a few of the titles, namely Defender and Spy Hunter, slowdown for no reason whatsoever and that's simply inexcusable for a cart of this type. However, at the end of the day this game does offer up six spectacular classics nearly intact and in one or two cases actually takes advantage of the Nintendo 64's controller too. If you're dying to get your hands on the oldies but goodies, for only $30 this purchase might just be a wise one. But it's not going to blow you away with flashy bells and whistles.", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
