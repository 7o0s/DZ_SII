And it's obvious from their new game, Star Trek: The Birds of Prey, that developer Jumbuck has a particular reverence for the show -- and even more importantly -- its fans. Knowing that Trekkies will swoop down and consume almost anything related to Captain James T. Kirk, Jumbuck could have slapped the Enterprise on any old shooter engine and enjoyed some easy download dollars. But instead, the developer opted to do what many wireless game developers cannot: make an excellent game based on a licensed property.   Star Trek: The Birds of Prey is a top-down shooter in the purest arcade-style vein. Sure, it's not necessarily the most ~realistic~ presentation of the Enterprise -- the hulking inter-galactic exploration ship that Kirk loves to blow up himself whenever he has a chance. The Enterprise cannot zoom from left to right and stop on a dime. But because the handset is hardly the proper platform for a Enterprise simlator, even the most hardcore Trekkie should be more than willing to forgive the need to commit a little blasphemy.   Star Trek: The Birds of Prey pits the crew of the Enterprise against two of the galaxy's most fearsome foes: Romulans and Klingons. Through six missions, the Enterprise chases down these scallywags and their terrible ships. This is no mission of peace, either. No truce, no mercy. These Klingons and Romulans have no interest in either, so Kirk & Co. must steel themselves for a battle to the death.   The Enterprise is armed with two weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. You will spend the majority of the game laying on the phasers as they have enough potency to take out small- to medium-range targets. But when you're facing a Klingon Bird of Prey with phasers most certainly not set on stun, bust out a homing photon torpedo to break open its hull. You do not have an unlimited number of photon torpedoes, so use them wisely. And for that matter, you don't haverapid fire phasers either. You cannot just volley phaser fire all willy-nilly or you will empty out their juice. You have to allow little moments for the batteries to recharge. There are additional power-ups to be found, such as a cloaking device and additional photon torpedoes.   The Enterprise is blessed with a nice set of factory-installed shields that repel basic enemy fire. However, your shields are not eternal. Each hit chips away at the shield meter, and once those shields are gone, every hit thereafter does direct damage to the Enterprise itself. And shields only protect against shots. You cannot ram enemy ships or bounce off of physical obstacles.   Gamers will certainly appreciate the game's difficulty. There may be only six levels, but they are fairly long and arduous to complete. Expect plenty of fun, twitch-action as you square off against Klingon ships and cannon batteries while flying through deep space or skimming across a planet's atmosphere. At no point does the game feel unfairly stacked against you -- it's a well-balanced, and very entertaining shooter.   (NOTE: Want to see images of the game? Check our image page here. As soon as we've finalized the redesign, screens will be attached to this review.)  Shooter fans will enjoy Star Trek: The Birds of Prey's smart game play, but I have to gush a little more about Jumbuck's attention to detail as far as the ~Star Trek~ universe is concerned. I'm not necessarily a fan, but I can appreciate how fans will like to hear real photon torpedo sounds or see the likeness of the Enterprise crew in short dialogue scenes. And, of course, the game employs the show theme which always seems to conjure a smile.", "date": "Dec 16, 2004"}
