As one of the world's earliest top-down shooters, it inspired the likes of 1941, 1942, and 1943. Whoa.   The Namco arcade classic arrived on Xbox Live Arcade this week and it is unfortunately among the worst values to come along since the $4-gallon of gas.    Sure, it's only 400 Microsoft Points, but even bare-bones ports like Rush'n Attack and Contra come with enhanced graphics and sound as well as some type of multiplayer mode. Xevious, on the other hand, features only its classic single-player game and an online leaderboard. As such, this game needs to cost 100 points... or less.      But hey, the throngs of Xevious groupies that have been clamoring for its release on XBLA finally get their wish. Thank goodness Memorial Day is around the corner and fans can spend a good 15 minutes of their holiday with the simplistic (and fun) gameplay and graphics of their old friend Xevious. Those hoping that Namco would add some kind of multiplayer to Xevious will be disappointed. Really, how hard is it to add two-player co-op to this game? It's only included in, like, every other top-down shooter ever. While fans will appreciate the faithful port of Xevious, some additional multiplayer element could have made an XBLA version even better.   The same goes for the graphics and sound. The green forests, deep blue rivers and lakes and spinning buzz saw enemies were amazing in 1982. The catchy jingle that plays at the beginning of every life is almost ring-tone worthy. But when every other classic game on XBLA is getting enhanced graphics and sound and some kind of new feature, if only because we have the technology to improve these classics, it's hard to let Xevious slide despite its fun gameplay.   The story of Xevious is surprisingly deep. You pilot a ship called a Solvalou. Then you blow stuff up. Back in 1982, that was innovative stuff. In Japan, Xevious is still considered one of the great arcade games of all time. The Solvalou comes equipped with a blaster to shoot at aerial targets as well as an unlimited supply of bombs for ground-based enemies.    Like most top-down shooters, hoards of enemies with various attack patterns flood the screen, and you must shoot them down and dodge their slow-moving bullets. There are a ton of secrets on the map which can be revealed by bullets and bombs for extra points and lives. Unlike most top-down shooters, there are no set levels or major bosses. Namco did divide the game up into vague areas, something you will only notice at the title screen as there are no noticeable transitions from one area to the next. From the title screen, you can select a level that you have already passed, all the way up to level 16. When completed, you'll seamlessly start over without so much as a blink of the eye. Occasionally you'll come across a giant tank or mothership, but the action continues to slowly scroll along forever.    OMG In that sense, Xevious is a classic, evoking memories of competing for that high score and punching in your initials to cement your greatness. And really, was there a better feeling than walking by your favorite old machine, be it Pac-Man or 1942 or Street Fighter 2, and seeing your initials under number one? While the online leaderboards give you a similar feeling of giddiness, it just isn't the same. Those days are gone and, like this unimproved and overpriced version of Xevious, best left in the past.", "date": "May 25, 2007"}
