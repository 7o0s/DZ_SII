It's not perfect - there are issues and points that will either get under your skin or not - but it never fails to entertain throughout.   Here's a point to mull over that is really going to guide the rest of this review: Assassin's Creed isn't GTA. It's not an RPG - even casually. The setting is huge and somewhat open-ended, but the game structure is not. If you were hoping for a game that lets you go anywhere and do anything, then please understand - this is a platformer with action and a bit of stealth. It's not particularly deep and you can follow a straight line from one goal to the next, just traversing rooftops and through villages on horseback. If you can contend with this, then you're in better stead to enjoy what is a game that only does a few things, but does them very, very well.   First of all, let's get this out of the way - the big twist is stupid and unnecessary; who knows why Ubisoft made such a hoo-ha about it. Actually, we do know why. It was for two reasons: to generate a groundswell of hype, and secondly, to avoid a backlash from players by revealing it at the end of the game and basically undermining the last 15 hours you just spent playing through it. How so? That's hard to say without spoiling things, but if you've been privy to any of the internet speculation, most of it has been spot on.  By revealing this key detail at the end, it would come as a cop-out.     If you took Prince of Persia and tossed in elements of Hitman and Shadow of the Colossus, the end result would look something like Assassin's Creed. In a lot of ways, the formula behind Shadow of the Colossus holds up well against Assassin's Creed. From early in the game, after going through early training levels and basic missions, the main game structure presents itself - you are ordered to start systematically bumping off supposedly corrupt, evil, violent and oppressive leaders and social figures throughout Jerusalem, Acre, Damascus and the surrounding Kingdom. You're effectively a pawn for the Assassin's Guild, where you get stripped of your rank and work your way back up the chain.   However, those expecting a smooth-flowing, GTA-like experience are in for a shock. Assassin's Creed is divided into chapters of sorts, and between them you're stuck in a confined holding space where a lot of exposition occurs and you can explore the story a little further. If this sound vague, believe me, it is for your own good. This section is all tied to the 'big reveal' - and we kind of wish it had been handled differently. The structure of the game suffers from breaking away from the action after every major assassination. It literally pulls you out and away from the action while characters talk at you for a few minutes and you walk around slowly until it's time to start the next mission. It works as a plot device, but we didn't really like the way this was handled. Sometimes, a cutscene just works better.   Free-running and combat are the game's strongest drawcards. Both are done exceptionally well; Altair is a master of his environment and this extends to the way you can use him to scale just about any vertical surface with an edge or jut. Ubisoft has erroneously compared the controls to that of a marionette - that's not quite right. In theory, the face buttons are assigned to body parts, but only in a very general sense. A lot of the time is spent holding down A and the right trigger to free-run - it's not exactly like you're actively controlling his legs; ultimately, you're just pressing buttons that happen to be linked to actions on screen.    Clearly, running through a crowd and knocking peasants on their ass is a great way to get spotted, whereas blending in with hooded monks or gently filing past people keeps the ever-watchful eye of the guards mostly off your back. When you start running, jumping, scaling, falling or scrapping, then you start to see the rules of Assassin's Creed's engagement. Criticisms have been levelled at Assassin's Creed in this respect. On one hand, guards and peasants mostly react the same way when attacking you or chasing you, leaving them open to exploitation. If you can break their line of sight with you, you can dive into a bale of hay or a veiled rooftop gazebo to escape; that's about as sophisticated as hiding in a cardboard box in Metal Gear Solid or in a dark corner in Splinter Cell. Anyone in real life with half a brain might do a little investigating. They don't in Assassin's Creed. Nor can they hear murderous acts being committed or care too much when they stumble over the corpse of a guard you tossed over a ledge or knifed from afar. They stick to routines and limited AI rules set up by the programmers, and there isn't a lot of flexibility.   Climbing to the highest point in the kingdom, Assassin's Creed flexes its graphical muscles.  This also really puts a question mark over the stealth element of the game. While some soldiers between cities or in sensitive areas of the cities will openly attack you if they spot you, they mostly just tell you to clear off. You can walk right up towards them, dangle above or below them even, but they won't attack you unless you provoke them. This breaks away from the logic too, again demonstrating the AI's shortcomings and inability to break out of routines and formulas.   'Formula' is actually a key word that ably describes this game. The work of an Assassin is to get the job done and follow the rules (the creed itself), which means sticking to a formula of sorts is the nature of the profession. Does that make for a game that consistently forces you to change up your approach to each task? No way; instead, you end up following this chain of events: first you scout out the area from a high vantage point, giving you map details on key characters. Then, you get yourself to the Assassin's Guild in that city. They will vest you with finding information on the target. From here, you're going to either start intimidating a character on the street by locking on with the left trigger and getting physical, or you'll pick pockets using a similar process, but by holding down B to extend your arm as you follow from behind. You can also speak to deep-throat informants who will only relinquish information if you perform a couple of kills or do a fairly irritating flag fetching mini-game.    Once you've done the legwork and collected key information on where to find your target, you need to leg it back to the Guild and get permission to perform the hit. It is here where the game actually frees itself from formula for a while, putting you in a setting with the person to whack - usually surrounded by guards. This might be a regal feast filled with aristocratic despots or in a hospital ward, where the target is making the rounds. It's up to you how you want to handle the kill. Generally, there is the possibility of performing a stealth kill - getting as close a possible to your intended victim from above or from the side without causing a stir and using your wrist blade (selected via up on the D-pad and activated with X) to bring him down.    If you go for something a little more overt, you can face off in straight-up combat. We love the fighting mechanics in the game - it has a kind of simplicity that is deceptive. Only one button, outside of blocking with the R trigger and locking on with the L trigger, guides the sword swings. Using X and good timing, you will start to hack and slash away at your nearest opponent. Blocking is only allowed when you're not attacking, but by timing your block, you can parry and counter-attack, effectively killing your opponent in one smooth movement. The real grace and intelligent design comes through in how Altair faces off against up to a dozen other sword-bearers at a time. For the most part, he is context-aware when it comes to blocking and attacking. He will automatically defend attackers coming up from the side or behind him, while well-timed movements or sword swings will allow you to leap from one enemy to the next with an ease and accuracy that would make Heavenly Sword blush.   It makes the frequency of such encounters a pleasure rather than a chore - and it constantly amazes us how deep the mechanics are, given the simplicity of the input. Outside of nearly flawless free-running technology, Assassin's Creed's other real charm lies in this aspect. Of course, this neglects the most obviously impressive element - the graphics themselves.   Climbing high and perching atop the towering spire of a gothic cathedral on the coastline of Jerusalem's walled city and looking out over the expansive vista that stretches off to the horizon, it's impossible not to marvel at what Ubisoft Montreal has achieved. The engine scales objects like buildings and landscapes marvellously well, handling the subsequent swan-dive-like Leap of Faith that follows most epic climbs without issue. At street level, weaving through the slums, merchant quarters and rich districts is a treat. The engine (on the 360, anyway) handles large crowds of up to a hundred without much of a drop in framerate, all while rendering the world with self-shadows, light blooming, simulations of sunlight passing behind clouds, high resolution textures and a massive draw distance.    The combat is handled with surprising depth, given the simplicity of the controls. The AI, however, doesn't quite cut it.  When running at speed and adjusting the camera (something you'll do a lot, since the auto-camera sits uncomfortably close to your character most of the time), there was a bit of screen-tearing, which was a little off-putting in the heat of a chase. And, while we dig the lip synched dialogue, the facial textures occasionally leave a little to be desired. Largely though, Assassin's Creed is a treat to look at. Riding through hillsides from one village to the next, occasionally breaking away to collect flags or scout out high-points, you really get to take in the attention to detail that has gone into the world.    There's a lot of subtlety that is easy to miss but really adds to the experience. The game is wholly playable with the HUD turned completely off. There are enough in-game indicators to let you know who's pick-pocketable, where you can safely leap off a ledge and into a bale of hay (look for the bird droppings), how much health you have and how visible you are. The experience is much more immersive than with the large and somewhat cluttered HUD that tracks your visibility, health and which movement set you currently have active. It's a point like this that sets Assassin's Creed apart from the chaff. It strives to go farther in areas of immersion and interaction than platformers ever have. It is also here that Assassin's Creed actually undermines itself.   By nature of the free-running gameplay and the big twist (that we've carefully been trying to sidestep, which has been damned hard), you ultimately come away with a feeling that, for all the throaty, flowery and convoluted dialogue, for all the set pieces and takes on actual historical figures and events, the game is somehow cheating you out of more gameplay.   It's a platformer for gamers who hate platformers. It doesn't overextend itself, which is to be both wary of and commended.  This is, at its heart, a platformer that does amazing things with technology that will impress you. Climbing, fighting, crowd physics and overall presentation aside, you will want to be able to have a similar flexibility of approach to dealing with NPCs, to sourcing equipment - even to moving in the framed-narrative segments of the game, in between the chapters. By trying so hard with some aspects of the game and succeeding, Assassin's Creed makes itself look shallow and generic in other departments. There just isn't the complexity in mission structure to impress players who have the misconception that this is an action RPG or GTA-style game. At the same time, the platforming and fighting is so good that not having more to do is okay by us. It's the argument that games like Ico, Rez or indeed Shadow of the Colossus present every once in a while - is it better to have a game that does a whole lot of things moderately well, or to have a game that lets you do a few things really well?    Do yourself a favour; play Assassin's Creed for yourself and make up your own mind. Chance are, if you go in with an open mind and lowered expectations, you're going to walk away very satisfied on most fronts. Regardless, it's an adventure that, for all the self-important dialogue and forced morality, is unquestionably worth your time - particularly for fans that can differentiate between action/platformers and stealth/RPGs.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
