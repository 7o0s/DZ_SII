With the announcement of the Burning Crusade Expansion for their award-winning World of Warcraft almost twelve months ago, and several months of intensive internal and external beta testing, the amount of hype that has been built up for this game has rarely been surpassed. With stores across the globe being shipped copies of the actual game weeks before the January 17th launch, it was clear that Blizzard expected this to be a major seller.   Midnight launch events had been organised worldwide, and even the smallest of launches often drew large crowds. But we will not relay the presence of cosplay and un-showered, neck-bearded nerds (this includes many of the girls too) or the unseemly store staff that served us, that is a story best kept in a sealed vault deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean where no one will ever witness its horrors ever again. Instead, the game itself is the topic at hand.   For the unenlightened, World of Warcraft is the world's best selling MMO, with well over 8 million subscribers worldwide. It has destroyed hundreds of marriages, made parents neglect their children until they starved to death, and likely cost the worldwide economy billions from people playing instead of working. But that's because it was awesomely fun, and dangerously addictive. The good news is that these trends of broken families and inefficient workers is likely to continue for quite a while yet, as The Burning Crusade is just as addictive and fun as ever.   A host of new abilities round out Burning Crusade's list of features.  For new players, or experienced players looking for a fresh start, the two original races (Draenei for the Alliance, Blood Elves for the Horde) provide a refreshing appearance for both sides, as the traditionally gloomy Horde gains control of the Saffron-coloured forest of Silvermoon, and the usually bright and perky Alliance obtain the grim, but still very pretty, crash site of Azuremyst Isle. The racial attributes are fairly balanced between the two, with the Blood Elves gaining a mana-drain ability and the Draenei a healing ability, but they seemingly leave the older races in the dust. So much so, that many players have abandoned their main characters to level a completely new one. Luckily, the new zones are in many ways much more fun than the older ones, so at least they have some semblance of justification beyond wanting to play a prettier character.   Subsequent to the race additions, however, the Horde has gained the Paladin class, and the Alliance has gained the Shaman. Traditionally, these were for one faction only, but after complaints from both sides of the fence of a fundamental imbalance, this was the fix put in place. Despite the initial complaints, it's difficult to see how they could have fixed it any other way.   For people looking to progress further, the previous level cap of 60 has been raised to 70, with ability upgrades every level and brand-new, never before seen abilities every two. In terms of actually levelling from 60 to 70, the time it takes can vary from about four or five days (of solid, non-stop grinding, skipping meals, depriving yourself of sleep, etc) to about a month for the more casual players, maybe longer. It really depends, not on how you play the game, but how you want to.    For those that reached the pinnacle of the 'old' game, basically the only way to advance lies beyond the dark portal. Stepping through will lead you to the burned and broken land of Hellfire Peninsula, and will put you face to face with the might of the Burning Legion (hence the name of the expansion). This is where the majority of the expansion actually exists - in a place called Outlands.    Our initial impression upon stepping through the portal is that this is a land very similar to places on the Azerothian continent, with its rocky red landscape. Durotar, Badlands and the Blasted Lands all looked very similar. Not even the monsters seem particularly varied - but this impression will last only a matter of minutes. Upon moving further into the continent, you begin to encounter very alien creatures, like the Ravagers, which move with unearthly speed on disproportionate bodies, and brand new threats (the Fel Reavers still occasionally give us nightmares).   And from there things become more alien. Zangarmarsh (arguably the prettiest zone in the expansion), an enormous bog with a canopy of giant mushrooms is undoubtedly the best example of this. With a light blue tinge to the ground, and glowing orange fungus scattered along the floor, the feeling of being on a completely different planet is captured very well; this is to say nothing of the sky, which is just gorgeous. Many of these areas have smaller sub-sections where the land changes drastically, such as the Zangarmarsh Spawning Grounds. But it's not just the land that is wildly varied. Spore Walkers (looking vaguely like the walkers from Half-Life 2) and Bog Lords (huge, bulbous, lurching humanoids) patrol the marsh grounds, leaving the carcasses of careless adventurers in their wake. But by far the coolest enemies are the Ethereals, whose movements are straight out of a Japanese horror movie, leaving behind momentary images of themselves as they drift closer, out for blood.   Despite the limitations of the engine, they have made the locations and enemies very impressive looking - which is a difficult task when you can't drastically update the graphics without alienating the portion of the player base with lower-end computers. The colours are very vibrant, but not gaudily so. They compliment the surroundings very nicely. The music, meanwhile, ranges from really moving orchestral pieces to the typical windy howls, with voice acting as cheesy as ever. After the hundredth time of hearing a Draenei say ~remember the light!~ it can start to get on your nerves.   The flying mounts add a bit of spice to traversing the world.  For quest lovers, there's literally hundreds of new quests and chains to maraud through, from culling the local bird population, to freeing captive children from crazed-bird people, to sifting through poop (yes, poop) forcherries. Blizzard has nothing if not a rather sick sense of humour. But despite the great quest dialogue, the majority of these are very much the same as they were prior to the expansion, which is to say, kill X rats, collect Y rat gizzards, and unless you have a fun group of people to talk to (big ups to The House) during the more tedious parts, these may tire you out.   The rewards for these quests are not what you'd call lacklustre either. Within a few levels the items you get will be on par with, if not better than, what many of the most difficult dungeons held as their ultimate prizes. However, in many respects this could be seen as a negative, as not only will lower level players be completely out-geared, but it also negates much of the allure of those dungeons. Whether something will be done to make them more appealing remains to be seen.   As for the newer dungeons, it seems that Blizzard has listened to its player base and gone with a much more efficient ~wing~ design, where it no longer takes several hours from start to finish. Now you choose the section with the bosses you want to fight and you do it. Bosses are also dealt with more creatively than in previous instances. Whereas in the original game, about ninety percent of all encounters were very simple ~attack that, heal him~ or ~tank-n-spank~, even the simplest of battles now have a gimmick of some sort. Being thrown into the air and frozen there in the Underbogs for the first time is the sort of thing that will make you elicit a chuckle of surprised joy - like watching an elderly woman beat down a bag-snatcher. And much as are the quest rewards, the instance loot is amazing. Brand new slotted items, coupled with the introduction of Jewelcrafting as a new profession, means more customisation and variety between players.    And it's evident that Blizzard has learnt from their mistakes from the release of the original, at least as far as ~endgame~ content is concerned, as all the new dungeons now have a ~heroic mode~, where the difficulty (and the rewards) are ramped up greatly, providing an ongoing challenge for smaller groups. Alternatively, for those tired of the dungeon crawls, brand new world PvP objectives have been added to all the areas of Outland, where the two factions may duke it out for control over something as simple as a tower, to something as complex as an entire town, and gain passive bonuses to their damage for doing so.   Where Blizzard hasn't learnt from their mistakes is with server stability. Due to the overwhelming numbers of people logging on to try out the new content, the servers had been crashing almost hourly for days after the release, and on several occasions the servers had to be restarted completely, causing much frustration and angry letter-writing.   As for the old continents, several new high-level instances ensure that you will still have good reason to travel back to your original stomping grounds. The Caverns of Time, where you replay some of the world-shaping events of Azeroth's history, such as the opening of the Dark Portal, and Medivh's Tower, where you explore the halls of an insane magician, are so rooted in the lore of Warcraft that even the most story-hungry geeks (i.e. us) will be satiated, if only for the duration of the dungeon.   Impressive new environs just itching to be explored.  Of course, there's plenty of content for raiders, and since the lowering of the player cap to 25, the raid dungeons have become much more accessible. Sort of. Many of them require the newly introduced flying mounts, which carry a hefty price, but makes travelling in the Outlands that much more fun.    The amount of time put into developing The Burning Crusade is completely justified. There are endless of hours of fun to be found, but only if you enjoyed the original. It hasn't really done anything to attract a new demographic, but in many ways that's a good thing. To overcomplicate or oversimplify the game would destroy what made it popular in the first place. Blizzard have taken what made the first game good, and improved upon it even further, without overcomplicating. It's not perfect, but then again, if it were, there'd be nothing more to add later.For the chance to win a Collector's Edition copy of Burning Crusade, enter our Journal Competition!", "date": "Jan 30, 2007"}
