Although this game is bad enough not to buy, it's probably good enough to purchase if you find it on sale. QBC '97 has all the bells and whistles that every football sim should have. Unfortunately, the s-l-o-w-g-a-m-e-p-l-a-y  makes this a lump of coal for Christmas.   It's a given: QBC '97 isn't better than Madden '97. However, this game has made a small breakthrough. While playing this game, I was suprised to see that  the players just didn't run into each other, they actually ~tackled~ each other. This is something that I would like to see in football games more often.  If the game wasn't so slow and the players weren't so pixilated, this game would be awesome. My advice? Wait for Quarterback Club '98.   Jason Boor", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
