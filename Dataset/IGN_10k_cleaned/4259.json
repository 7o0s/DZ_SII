With the likes of Hidden and Dangerous, Serious Sam and Chaser invading our already shooter-stuffed shelves over the past few years, it's hard for a discerning FPS player to know exactly what shooter is going to offer the best bang for their buck. The good thing is Eastern European FPS developers generally tend to get it right, at least in terms of game design (yeah, yeah...we know they have a penchant for being buggy), and don't stick to the tried-and-true first-person shooter formula that we've all played again and again and again. The same holds true for Polish developer Techland, the team behind Chrome, who offer up something a little bit different for your first-person shooter diet.The storyline revolves around a valuable mineral known as chrome (no, not that stuff your hubcaps are plated with...this stuff is actually worth something). Apparently this is the end all and be all of futuristic resources, and two corporations are vying for control over the entire supply in the universe. That's where you come in. You play as Logan, a mercenary caught between the power struggle of the two corporations. Throughout the game you'll take on missions provided by the corporations, and eventually must make a choice between going completely corporate to earn a wage or to stick it to ~The Man~ and fight for the worker's rights.Chrome is comprised of 14 levels spread over a number of different planets. Most of the levels are comprised of multi-step, objective-based missions where you're contracted to perform such tasks as stealing secret documents, rescuing hostages, download data from a computer deep within an enemy base, demolition buildings and plain ol' vanilla assassination. On the default difficulty level, it should take you about a dozen or so hours to complete, which isn't bad for a shooter these days.  Gameplay lies somewhere between Unreal and Battlefield 1942. While it's a heavy-action first-person shooter, firing accurately while running at full speed is pretty much impossible, and you have to hit the right mouse button to stabilize yourself to aim properly, similar to crouching in Battlefield 1942. While this may take a bit of getting used to at first for many FPS players, the system actually works quite well, and you have to carefully plan when you're going to shoot and not leave yourself completely in the open since you'll slow down considerably while aiming, leaving yourself open for a counter-attack. You'll also want to take quick shots, as the automatic weapons do have some kick, and you can't keep your target on enemies while unloading your clip without correcting your aim manually. One drawback to the aiming system is that you can't shoot while leaning, so tilting your head around a corner is only really useful for scouting out an area before you go running in, guns blazing.Chrome offers up a variety of different play styles within its first-person shooter core, like driving vehicles, manning turrets and sniping from high towers -- and that's all within the first 15 minutes of play. These different sequences pop up throughout the game, and break up the monotony of just a pure FPS. There's also a hacking mini-game similar to Concentration (you know, match the shapes, win a cupie doll) that you use to break into enemy computers and perform such actions as disabling security systems, downloading valuable information and opening previously locked areas. All of these different elements put an interesting twist in the all too formulaic FPS design, and it's these aspects where Chrome really sets itself apart from the cookie-cutter FPS.   Chrome also includes some RPG-lite elements in the form of inventory management, similar to Planetside. You're limited to the amount of equipment you can carry, which means you can't haul the entire contents of the National Guard Amory around the countryside. You generally carry two guns with you at any given time, and the heavier weapons like the rocket launcher and sniper rifle are so large that they take up quite a bit of your inventory space, and you're only able to carry a pistol as your sidearm if you decide to go with one of those.There are a few boxes to open and a smattering of items to find in the game, but for the most part you're going to get your ammo, health packs and grenades from your fallen foes. While inventory space is limited, looting corpses during the game gives you a chance to change weapons often if you desire. However, for the most part you're going to pick your default -- and favored -- weapon load out before going into a level, so the only times you really change weapons is if you want to pick up that sniper rifle to cause a little long-range chaos, or grab a rocket launcher and get to the task of blowing the crap outta stuff.Seeing as this is a futuristic FPS, you also have a few implants that give you special abilities such as increased speed, hardened skin, more accurate aiming and a built-in zoom function. However, they're mostly only good when used sparingly, because if you use more than two at a time, they tend to eat up your energy too fast, and you suffer some damage and black out for a bit.The artificial intelligence is decent, but nothing special. While enemies will occasionally seek cover or run to get buddies, for the most part they don't use any advanced tactics, and they're more likely to run straight at you with guns blazing than try to coordinate a group effort. They also tend to miss the fact that their friends are being gunned down unless they're right next to them as they fall. It's as if they all have noise-canceling headphones on and can't hear your shots, and only recognize someone's shooting their comrades if they see it happen. The nice thing about the AI is that, once it's active, it seems to respond to the game world in a logical manner. Your opponents don't instantly target in on you and know your exact position, and it's actually possible to lose enemies if you're crafty and stay hidden long enough.  For the most part, on the default difficulty setting, the game is pretty easy. Health packs and ammunition are plentiful as you harvest the bodies of your fallen foes. However, the ~Very Hard~ difficulty level is just that -- very hard. Even seasoned first-person shooter fans will have a tough time. The main differences in difficulty level is that the enemies are a lot more aggressive, become a lot more accurate with their shots and you lose your forward-sensing radar at higher difficulty levels. Corpses also have far fewer items, so you have to conserve more if you play at higher levels. The part of the game that is a bit difficult on the default difficulty are the big boss battles, which you'll encounter after a few missions on each planet.Although not up to the caliber of Unreal II, Chrome is a good-looking shooter that features nice textures, bump-mapping, beautiful, realistic natural environments (especially the dense forests packed with the most vegetation I've ever seen in an FPS) and shafts of light that trickle through the canopy of trees. The glass breaking effect is pretty neat as well, as the glass begins to crack from the exact point of impact and eventually shatters into nothingness, falling from the sky in a rain of shimmering, yet harmless, shards. It also runs well on mid-level systems, meaning you won't have to shell out any extra bucks to upgrade your system just to play the game.    Shadows do tend to be a bit hard and they sometimes reflect off of things they shouldn't, like full shadows being cast on chain-link fences and ferns with spread leaves. The explosions are also unimpressive and wimpy, which is a shame since there's so much to blow up with grenades and the rocket launcher.As pretty as the natural environments are, the character models look a bit blocky and dated, and the faces suffer from sour-lips, as most of the characters in the game look like they just sucked on a lemon for an hour. They also tend to be rather dark and masked in shadows, even in well-lighted areas. Like the models, character animation leaves a bit to be desired, and their movements are very stiff and stilted.The character models certainly aren't stiff when you shoot them, though. The ragdoll physics go a bit haywire sometimes as bodies writhe and vibrate like a cheap hotel bed filled with too many quarters when they slump against walls or onto railings. They also tend to be a bit over-the-top, and one shot can send an enemy flipping and flailing in midair as if he's filled with helium. Of course, this is mighty satisfying as well, and I guess you can explain it by saying that all these various planets Logan is traveling to have a low gravity. Hey, it's possible, right?Even though a bit repetitive, level design is logical -- if you infiltrate a base to steal a data pad, you have to leave the base to get it out. Levels are huge with absolutely no loading within each, but you will have to wait through extremely long load times -- sometimes a minute or longer -- while particularly large level load. Long load times combined with lengthy cutscenes do break the action up a bit, but the story is interesting and compelling enough that I didn't mind so much.The audio is really the biggest weakness of Chrome. There are lots of environmental and animal sounds which really immerse you in the beautiful settings, but the sound effects are highly compressed, making the blast of gun shots sound wimpy and tinny even on a system with a good subwoofer. The voice acting is pretty cheesy and unemotional, and does little to get you into the plight of a space mercenary. At one point Logan exclaims, ~I've blown them all to shreds! Let's go!,~ and his companion Carrie unexcitedly replies ~Okay.~   While the single-player side offers up a lot of fun, the multiplayer side of Chrome is much less exciting. Included are the standard gameplay types: two capture the flag maps, two deathmatch maps, three team death match maps and one assault map. Even though the game has been out a few weeks, there were only six multiplayer servers up (four of those in the UK), and only four people playing in total. Techland tried to tackle a lot with Chrome, and for the most part they got it right. It's a little rough around the edges and has its share of problems, but they're minor blemishes for the most part, and it's definitely better than your average first-person shooter. It combines several elements into a single game, which offers a wide variety of gameplay. It's also $40, so while not a bargain game, it is a little cheaper than most new releases. It's not going to appeal to everyone, but this one's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something a little different in the FPS realm. However, I will warn you not to base the game off of the demo level because it isn't really a great representation of the depth and quality design of Chrome.", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
