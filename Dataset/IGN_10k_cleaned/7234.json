Cities are wiped from the face of the planet, entire continents are crushed by nuclear onslaught and the Earth's population is decimated as six superpowers wage war on each other. Everybody dies.   That, in a nutshell, is DEFCON, the explosive new strategy game from Introversion - the developer behind the critically-adored Darwinia and lesser-known, but equally brilliant, Uplink. The aim of the game is simple: cause mass destruction on a global scale by launching nuclear attacks on rival superpowers while, at the same time, protecting your own borders from enemy strikes. Refreshingly, it's as easy to play as it is to explain, with many of the elements that tend to overcomplicate strategy games - such as resource management - stripped away to shift focus onto killing every last living, breathing person on the planet.   However, before the bloodbath begins, the conditions of war must first be determined. There are six superpowers fighting for global domination, these being Asia, Russia, North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Players each choose a faction to side with and the remaining powers are either allocated to CPU players or left out of the game entirely. As such there's tremendous scope for playing DEFCON on a number of levels, from straightforward one-on-one conflicts - an obvious starting point for new players - to six-player all-against-all bun fights best left for those who know their silos from their subs.    With superpowers decided, the campaign map opens up - a Tron-style representation of the world - and the countdown to carnage starts ticking. Starting at DEFCON 5, it's the calm before the storm with players unable to initiate strikes on the enemy until the threat alert reaches DEFCON 3. Instead, the time is used to devise a plan of attack, surveying the enemy's position and deploying units accordingly. DEFCON's stylish neon wireframe graphics - taken straight out of the movie WarGames - depict the global battlefield, with cities marked on the map as diamonds. Units can be placed anywhere within the boundaries of your territory, using the mouse and keyboard to move quickly and easily around the map, with the mouse wheel zooming in and out.   There are three main types of unit: radar, airbase and missile silo. The latter is perhaps the most important as it's from these bunkers that each player rains nuclear death on the enemy. However, as the game unfolds, it's quickly apparent that each of the other units plays an important role too, meaning their placement is equally vital. Radar, for example, highlights the position of any enemy units within range so without it you'll be fighting blind. It's therefore wise to arrange your Radar units along the coastal regions of your continent so enemy units are detected before they get within striking distance. Airbases are capable of launching fighters and bombers, the light jets used to scout out beyond the reaches of your radar dishes as well eliminating enemy aircraft. Heavy bombers, on the other hand, are extremely important defensively and can target enemy naval units camped off your coastline.   Speaking of which, each player has a number of naval fleets at their disposal too, comprised of submarines, battleships and carriers. Subs can get within close proximity of an enemy territory without being detected, where they can sit and bombard cites with nuclear warheads. Carriers are equipped with anti-submarine sonar and depth charges to counter the underwater menace, plus they can launch fighters and bombers - however, they're vulnerable to attack from battleships. The cannons on these hulking leviathans can destroy other ships and even raze a city to the ground in seconds, but their short range means they must draw close to the coast to get a clear shot - leaving them prone to attack from submarines. As such, striking the right balance of ship types in each fleet - a mixture of six different units is possible - is essential, ensuring carriers are protected by battleships, battleships are protected from subs and so on.     The cut-out off point for deploying units is when the countdown reaches DEFCON 3, so players only have a few minutes to plan their strategies. Anything not placed by this point is lost. During DEFCON 3 naval units are free to move and attack: battleships positioned within striking distance of cities, fighters launched to spy on the enemy and subs camped off the coast of enemy territory, waiting to pounce.   Executing such tactics with military precision is a breeze in the tutorial missions but it's much tougher in the heat of the battle, especially against a skilled opponent. Should you group your naval units together and plough around the ocean as one giant fleet, destroying all in your path but risking the chance a rogue sub might sneak by? Or maybe it's better to spread units out evenly, covering every angle of attack, albeit at the expense of opening yourself up to a concentrated strike.   Such decisions make DEFCON such a wonderfully balanced experience. In many respects it's similar to the board game Risk, in that it's very simple to pick up and play but tactically there are many layers of depth to discover. Unlike other strategy games, which swamp the player with new units and upgrades every couple of missions, you only get the units you start off with. Learning how to use them effectively therefore takes time - refining tactics is the only way to completely obliterate the enemy.   That said, when the nukes start flying as the countdown reaches DEFCON 1 it's hard to keep a cool head. Switching silos from air defence to thermo-nuclear attack, you need to play a careful game of cat-and-mouse when deciding to launch the first attack. Initiating the primary strike gives you the advantage of making the first kill but, in doing so, the location of the launch silo is unveiled, leaving it open to enemy attack. However, wait too long and your cities could be reduced to rubble before you have time to react.    Either way, whatever moment you choose to strike, there's only one result: death, and on a massive scale. When a nuke impacts on a city, there isn't a big, flashy explosion or booming sound effect, just a white blip accompanied by a pop-up box detailing the death toll: '1.6 million dead.' It's a very matter-of-fact approach that, at least to begin with, is very disconcerting. On the one hand players experience a feeling of euphoria when a missile hits its target but, on the other, there's real sense of guilt as Tokyo, London, Los Angeles - wherever - is nuked and millions have died.   The experience is further enhanced by the haunting soundtrack, which provides a melancholy, almost oppressive backdrop to the game. Best described as mood music, it changes to reflect the action, growing in intensity as the countdown nears DEFCON 1. Effects are used superbly too, with the howling winds of the holocaust echoing in the background, nursery rhymes floating eerily from one speaker to the other and the faint cough as another innocent victim draws their last breath can all be heard as you prime your next nuke. It's disturbing stuff, but it perfectly complements DEFCON's minimalist visual approach.   Ultimately, DEFCON's only a game and any pang of guilt is soon quashed when the enemy takes out one of your cities. However, Introversion has managed to make DEFCON both an emotional and physical experience - one which questions the ethics of nuclear war too, and that can only be applauded.DEFCON is fine testament to an independent developer willing to take a risk by creating games that tackle unsual ideas in thought-provoking, engaging and ultimately entertaining ways. Admittedly, DEFCON's concept isn't original in the traditional sense  the Cold War idea is borrowed from the 1983 movie WarGames. Where the game succeeds is in its implementation, with Introversion crafting DEFCON into a compelling gaming experience, ensuring its as simple to play as any board game, but still has the depth and fine-tuned gameplay to guarantee youll be playing it for months to come. Very impressive stuff - and it'll only cost you 10 from Steam.", "date": "Sep 14, 2006"}
