A quick search for TrackMania on Youtube or a visit to the videos section on the official site will show you just how active - and creative - the community surrounding this series is. These guys are passionate; they've built thousands of tracks, made countless car models, clocked amazing times on all the courses, endlessly debated the merits of the game, and of course, created some of the coolest stunt videos of all time. This is a community that overlaid 1000 replays of a course into one file to create the hypnotic and inspired 1K Project, then set out to up the ante several more times.   It's little wonder really. TrackMania is a breath of fresh air on a platform well known for its serious racing sims, bringing a sense of fun and vitality back to racing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time this is a series with a wealth of gameplay and content. Before we go any further, we should make it clear that TrackMania United is far from a revolution. It very much picks up where TrackMania Sunrise left off, with the same main modes and essentially the same content creation functionality. That's far from a bad thing. The biggest change is that TrackMania United recognises the role of the community more so than any previous release, with extensive options baked right into the interface.   Isn't red meant to be the fastest colour? This game doesn't even respect the laws of physics.  Now that we've thrown around words like ~vitality~ and ~ante~, we'd better back them up with some cold hard facts, and oh-so-subjective opinion. The single player component of TrackMania United is divided into three very different modes. Race mode is all about time trials - rocketing through each course to try and beat the coveted gold medal time, or perhaps settling for so-so silver or shameful bronze. Each medal time has its own ghost car that you can select and use as a pace car, which brings an important sense of direct competition to proceedings.    Race mode certainly isn't lacking in content, with a huge array of courses and difficulty levels. The mode is divided into themed settings - Stadium, Island, Desert, Rally, Bay, Coast and Snow, with each offering far more than just a new coat of paint. Each setting comes with its own unique vehicle, and hence its own style of design to suit that vehicle. For instance, you'll start off with relatively slow, moderately manoeuvrable Indy cars in the Stadium courses. Here you'll find wide, winding courses that mix it up a little, switching between dirt and concrete surfaces. Move on to Island, however, and the style of racing changes completely. Now you're behind the wheel of a super fast racing car, and suddenly the Stadium shenanigans feel completely sedate. You're blazing along at twice the speed, whipping around corners, catching mammoth air and zooming through loop the loops. Progress to the Desert courses and the tone changes yet again. To the melancholy sound of a steel guitar, you'll find yourself in a box of a car that threatens to roll every time you take a corner sharply, and the courses are narrow with lots of tight, right angle turns and controlled jumps.   I've seen steeper...  While the handling may seem simple at first, to succeed in TrackMania, you'll need to learn its subtleties. For instance, you have some control over the distance you travel when airborne: hold brake to drop short, keep the pedal to the metal to get maximum distance. You can also get sideways rotation in the air by swinging the wheel just as you hit the lip of a jump. It's hardly rocket science, but there's enough depth in the handling to ensure that you can enjoy the game design to the full.   The Race mode alone has enough content to keep the average arcade racing fan happy for hours on end, and while you may not be racing against a pack, beating those medal times becomes all consuming. This is a title that nails compulsive ~just one more go~ gameplay at a fundamental level. Your delete key - a.k.a. restart - will never be the same again. Of course, it's all taken to another level by the online integration. When you boot into the game you're automatically logged into the TrackMania servers, so if you click on a particular race, the game brings up the top ten times for the course. Want to see how the guy who clocked the fastest race in the world took the course? Just click on his time, choose Get Replay, pay for it using the in-game currency and five seconds later (the files are tiny), you've got the replay to watch or use as a pace car. Racing against the world's fastest ghost time can be a sobering experience, as can watching the precision with which the top drivers take the course. It's a great system, as you can always see how you're tracking compared to other actual players, rather than the times set by the developers. The replay system is a little less intuitive than it should be, however. If you want to simply watch the ghost replay (as opposed to racing with it) you have to back all the way out to the main menu screen and go into the editor. All the downloaded replays (whether from Race mode or Platform) get thrown into the one list, with no visual representation of what they are, which is a pretty unappealing way to present them. It would have made far more sense to simply integrate them into the main menus.   1K Project envy.  Of course, the Race mode action doesn't stop there. Even if you've somehow clocked gold times on all the courses, you can always add more to the collection. See that ~Get A New Challenge~ button at the bottom of screen? Of course you can't, but just imagine for a moment that you can (work with me people). Simply hit that and the game connects to the server and picks a user-created map for you to download. You can't choose your map, but the selection isn't entirely random, instead being based on meta data. Once you've raced the course you're given the option to rate it on difficulty and design, which then gets added to all the other opinions in the database, theoretically meaning you'll only ever get popular maps. Plus, the editor is powerful enough that the best user-created courses can rival the maps that ship with the game. Almost limitless content baby!    While the Race mode doesn't necessarily bring anything revolutionary to the racing genre, the other two modes in the game - although not new to the series - really shake things up. Puzzle mode has a huge number of challenges to work through, only this time you're presented with an area of land with a start point, finish line and checkpoints scattered across it. You're given a set number of building blocks - squares of tarmac, ramps and so on, and have to construct a path from start to finish, through all the checkpoints. As you can imagine, there can be any number of ways to construct a workable path, but that's only one part of it, as you still have times to beat to earn those precious medals. Thus, if you want to get one of those top 10 leader board slots, you'll have to think laterally and race incredibly efficiently. Puzzle mode won't be for everyone, but it's a clever inclusion on the part of the developer, as it means that players start getting their heads around the basics of the track editor as a routine part of the game. This makes creating new tracks from scratch a less daunting proposition. It's no wonder there are so many user-created courses online.   The final mode is Platform, and it's a fantastic combination of inventive course design and precision driving. One course, for instance, may put you behind the wheel of a sports car and demand that you negotiate a treacherous course filled with loops, drops and huge jumps that have to be hit at just the right speed and angle to land on the next slice of track. Get a turn wrong and you'll plunge off the course and be forced to use up one of your precious restarts, which will take you back to the last passed checkpoint. The aim of each challenge is simply to get to the end in less than ten restarts, but of course, the record holders invariably do it in one. It's an engrossing and humbling experience watching the top replays and seeing how smoothly these players get through the courses, particularly when you've just blown all ten of your restarts trying to nail one annoying jump. Once again the replay system brings a new level to the game, giving you an insight into technique, and often a new perspective on how to approach different sections.    See that tower in the background? Shades of Hong Kong anyone?  The Platform mode uses every trick in the book to test the player, and like the Race mode, each vehicle brings with it a unique challenge which the developer fully takes advantage of. Some sections require small, precise jumps, avoiding obstacles and driving between angled surfaces. Others are like the ultimate stunt sequence - launching along a series of boost pads in the sky, skimming off water, driving upside down through tunnels and hitting massive banked turns at speed. There are also clever sections with tiles that kill your acceleration, so you'll have to hit them as fast as you can to have the momentum to coast to the next checkpoint. There's just so much to this mode. Yes, trial and error is a massive part of it, and there's no question it can get frustrating, but on the whole Platform mode is where it's at.   So far we've discussed the leader boards and downloadable replays built into the different modes, but United goes several steps further, putting a dedicated button on the main menu called ManiaLink. Click on this and you'll be presented with a whole host of options - Community, Tracks, Teams, Videos, 3D Models, Skins, Competitions, Others and Webisodes. Click on Tracks, for instance, and you'll have access to different community pages for track downloads - all within the game. The presentation of the mini-sites are great, but the same can't be said for the functionality. Some of the pages are achingly slow to load and we had serious issues getting videos to actually stream. Worst of all, there doesn't seem to be any ranking system for the content. If you just want to hop in and grab a couple of the most popular user created courses, you can't - you have to wade through any number of TrackMania crews and any number of possible downloads. At the end of the day it's an interesting attempt, but traditional fan sites, as opposed to these mini-sites are far more useful. It's a shame. You'll also find community content - a link to the latest community news and the last few forums topics, as well as a built in messaging system, on the main menu.   Watch the pros nail each course and cry.  Anything you download through the game will cost you Coppers, the currency of TrackMania. You can earn them in a number of ways, such as uploading content, posting medal winning ~official~ times, even just logging in to the game each day. It's an interesting, if a little unnecessary system, as is the distinction between practice times and official times within the game. Essentially, you could race the fastest time trial in the world on a particular course, but if you didn't manually change to the official setting from within the race (you can't do it when selecting the track) it won't count for anything, other than a record within your game. The idea is that you log a few practice times then switch to official when you're actually trying to post a competitive time to be uploaded and compared to other racers, but it seems a little pointless to us. If you get the best time, you should get the best time, simple as that.  Theres still more to discuss with TrackMania, such as the robust track editor and multiplayer functionality, but well leave that for you guys to discover when you get the game. You will get the game right? Seriously, if youve never played TrackMania before, and want a game thats equal parts fun and equal parts challenge, this is the one for you.Want to have your say?
