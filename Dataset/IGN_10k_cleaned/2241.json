Look at that low frame rate!~  But, graphics alone don't ever make a game good, but sometimes good controls and fun factor do.   Since Neversoft was working on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the PS2, Activision handed the PlayStation version to Shaba Games, which developed Sony's Grind Session, a nice game in its own right. Not too shabby, Shaba. They did a good job of keeping most of the level designs, without adding too much slowdown.      Gameplay For those of you who have not played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, where have you been? Tony Hawk's Pro Skater has been the one of the best game series released on the PlayStation. You choose a skateboarder and proceed to perform various tricks, score points and collect hidden items throughout the wide variety of skateparks in the game.   In all fairness I should compare this game to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.  The graphics are pretty much the same.  Executing tricks?  Same.  ~So, if I own T. Hawk 2 why should I buy #3?~ you ask.  Well, my friend, besides the new character line up, there are many improvements in this game.   The tricks in T. Hawk 3 are all executed the same.  Tricks are performed by pressing a button and a direction on the D-pad.  The biggest change in the game is the addition of the ~Revert,~ which is the newest trick in the arsenal of the T. Hawk 3 skaters.  When coming down from a ramp, pressing R2 activates the revert, basically pulling off a switch with your board.  This move will open the door for half pipe skaters, because before you were limited to ending your trick as you came down a ramp.  Now you can hit the revert to execute a manual, go up the other side of the half pipe, come down, and repeat.   T. Hawk 3 has completely eliminated money.  Levels are unlocked by completing level goals. Buying stat points and new boards are also no longer available.  Instead ~stat points~ and the ~hidden deck~ are scattered throughout the levels.       Characters   Like in all the other games, there are plenty of skateboarders from which to choose.  Here's the rundown of selectable characters:  Tony Hawk Steve Caballero Kareem Campbell Rune Glifberg Eric Koston Buck Lasek Rodney Mullen Chad Muska Andrew Reynolds Geoff Rowley Elissa Steamer Jamie Thomas Bam Margera       There also are hidden characters to unlock by beating the game with a 100% score with any character.    Levels   T. Hawk 3 features a wide variety of new level designs.  All are unique to the area from which they come.  For example, Los Angeles has a freeway, the airport takes place in an airport, and Japan has lots of neon lights (Japan has lots of neon lights?). Here's a list of selectable levels I could choose from.  The Foundry Los Angeles Rio Suburbia Airport Skater Island Canada Tokyo    Customizable There is also a ~Park Editor~ where you can create your own skate park.  There are various bowls, halfpipes, rails, and ramps to choose from.  Each bowl, halfpipe, and rail has a submenu where you can select from many different versions of each item.  Naming gaps is back in T. Hawk 3, which was always a cool feature in T. Hawk 2.  I remember, back when my friends and I played T. Hawk 2, we named this one gap, and would always grind it the opposite way.  To this day ~backwards up the poop shoot~ has to be the funniest trick in T. Hawk 2.  Well in our park, anyways.    While we're on the topic of ~editing~ I think it would be appropriate to mention the ~create-a-skater~ mode.  Like the mode suggests, players have the ability to customize their own skater.  There are no changes from the second T. Hawk.  All the options are basically the same.  There are many new heads and clothes to choose from, but the ability to select sunglasses, with different hairstyles and colors is not available.  Too bad, I really wanted to make a disco stu character.  Guess I have to do it on PS2.    PSX vs. PS2 differences?  For those of you who are reading this review just to see ~Well I bought the PS2 version and it rocks! Why would I buy the PlayStation version if it's going to be the same game with crappier graphics.~  I'm here to tell you there are many differences between the PlayStation and PS2 game.      Gap checklist.  Need I say more?  I don't know if it's unlockable in the PS2 version.  But off the bat, the fact there's a gap checklist insures the endless replay value of this game.  I remember my friends and I spending hours on T. Hawk 2, ~OK, what was that gap called?  I did that!  Didn't I?~  And if you're like me and loved the replay value of T. Hawk 2 you were totally bummed when this option wasn't available on the PS2 version.    Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the PlayStation is very different from the PS2 version.  Sure, the character rundown, the moves, and the names of the skateparks are the same, but the levels and goals are very different.    In the foundry level there are no people, so the ~dunk the foreman~ goal is not available.  They have substituted a goal called ~Activate Press~ which is located in the center of the park.  Both the PS2 and the PlayStation version have the press, but in the PlayStation version you must find a switch and activate it.  The other difference in the foundry is grinding the valves does not unlock the room with the bowl behind your starting point.    Every level is in this game is different from the PS2 version.  But I'm going to let you discover them, instead of describe them all.      Graphics  The graphics in the game have not changed much compared to T. Hawk 2.  If you look at the PS2 version, of course this game is going to look rather unattractive. But if you realize that this is a PlayStation game, the graphics are better than decent.  A nice addition is the meter that pops up when you do grinds, so you can judge how far you are leaning. It sure beats T. Hawk 2 where there is no meter and you have to guess based on the lean of the character.     The pop-up on the game is still very obvious. Grinding down a rail, then all of a sudden ~Where'd that wall come from!? Arggg!!!~ OK, OK, maybe it's not that bad, but it's bad when you're looking for stat points and you can't see them because they're too far away.      There was also one weird buggy area in the game that I found while skating in L.A.  One goal in L.A. is ~Kickflip over the elevator lobby.~  When attempting this trick, I was the on side of the building opposite the halfpipe.  I jumped into the air and fell into the wall.  While stuck in the wall I discovered that I could still do tricks.  I proceeded to execute maneuvers, thus my score increased.  I could not land so I wasn't able to secure the great score I had earned.  I did, however, find out the trick multiplier stops at 55, and when I turned the machine off my score was 8,000,000x55.  I figured the game was tired with me...    Sound  The grinds, flips, and skating on different surfaces all sound real, and overall, the game's sound department fairs well. But by far the best sound is the bailing.  Every time I watch my character scrub, I cringe and I know it's not only because of the character falling and bleeding, but the sounds he makes as his body hits the pavement. The score consists of great bands such as Motorhead, The Ramones, House of Pain, and other various artists.I have to say this game really surprised me.  At first glance all I could think about was the PS2 version of this game and feel the dread that I would have to play Tony Hawk on the PlayStation.  But once I got past the graphics and low frame rate I actually started to have fun. All of the goals were different and the items were scattered around in different places. It was a completely new game to play.  Tasks were actually a little more difficult, and required a bit more skill on my part.  I was a little disappointed with the create-a-skater mode, but the fact we could take it ~backwards up the poop shoot~ makes for a great feature and was glad they didn't remove it.  nd the fact there's a gap checklist adds hours of replay value.  So if you're one of those people who doesn't own a PS2, and you aren't willing to shell out $300 for the system and an extra $50 for the PS2 version, this is the game for you.", "date": "Nov 10, 2001"}
