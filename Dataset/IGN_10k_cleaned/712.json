Now Rising Sun brings the same turn-based, platoon level warfare to the Pacific Theater. From the first clash at the Gin Drinker's Line to the hypothetical invasion of Japan, Rising Sun covers the whole of the Pacific War as it played out on in the jungles and rice paddies of the Pacific. The game is a welcome addition to the Campaign Series, with several impressive features. Rising Sun attempts to walk the line between gritty realism and ease of use, not always with positive results.  TalonSoft is making a serious effort with this game to reach out to the less fanatical members of the gaming public -- people who don't care how many rounds a M2A4 tank can carry or what the displacement is on an LVT4 amphibious personnel carrier. Jim Rose, C-in-C of TalonSoft, has described this game as ~grognard-lite.~ That's not to say that this isn't a serious wargame. It is in fact much more tough in the realism department than may be palatable for some of the casual gamers that TalonSoft is hoping to bring into the fold.  Much of the broad appeal for the game is based in a series of optional rules. In other words, if you're an old-school grognard, then you can worry about armor facings and command control all you like. If, on the other hand, you'd prefer to ignore all that stuff and just focus on beating the crap out of your enemy, you can do that too. Despite that, the game is probably still a little too complicated to have the mass appeal that TalonSoft seems to be aiming for. Having said that, the game is a joy for anyone who has the requisite patience and insight to approach the title.  This balance extends into the scale of the game as well. It's sort of in between worlds. The game lacks the immediate and decisive punch of a purely tactical game and it lacks the strategic control and flexibility of operational games. It doesn't seem as if Rising Sun can't make up its mind which type of game it's supposed to be however. This balancing act appears to be the result of a desire to give players the best of both styles. The net result is that you can get close enough to the action to get a sense of the human element of it all and you can pull far enough away to get a sense of the shape of the battle.  The level of detail in the game is phenomenal. Some of the combat resolution equations are even printed in the manual. Despite their impressiveness, they're real snoozers. Thankfully most of the complexity of the game is hidden within the engine if not within the manual. Net result? You'll never have to worry about. This hidden detail throws open the door for you to concentrate on formulating your tactics without having to be aware of every single rule. If it makes sense in real life, odds are it's mirrored in the game architecture somewhere.  One of my big complaints against the game is the unwieldy interface. Overall, there are far too many options here and there not too well laid out. Throughout it all, I could never escape the fact that I was playing a game. And all this simply because the interface is too distracting. The game goes a long way towards fixing this problem with a pretty inventive system of hotkeys, but the whole point of using hotkeys is to get the interface out of my way. The flip side of these shortcomings is that the game doesn't shortchange the player in the flexibility department. The orders system will permit you to exercise nearly every strategic nuance at your disposal, and all without having to keep in mind hundreds and hundreds of rules.  Like the first two games in the series, Rising Sun offers you a ridiculous number of units. There are hundreds of separate units in the game. I'd give you a much more accurate count but my eyes glazed over once I had counted 300 of them. Each unit is rated in several characteristics and, unlike some other games, the differences here seem to mean something. To help simplify all these stats, Rising Sun provides you with a small but meaningful unit info box while the game is running. Beyond the ordinary armor, artillery and infantry units, you'll also need to use leaders, supply trucks and engineers.  Rising Sun features two types of campaigns. The three Linked campaigns follow a preset path from mission to mission. But these missions aren't going to play the same from one to another. Your victory level in the previous scenario has a significant impact on the set-up for later missions. Four Dynamic campaigns are more random while still following the broad historical trends. The invasion of Japan campaign falls under this heading. The Dynamic campaign also features a leader unit that represents you on the battlefield. If he gets killed, the game is over. Units gain experience and promotions throughout both types of campaigns and you'll also have to manage replacements and equipment upgrades.  The game comes with 40 separate scenarios that pull engagements from all periods of the Pacific War. There's quite a mix of engagement types, maps and complexities to these scenarios. The inclusion of a tutorial scenario helps you get familiar with the rules and four Boot Camp scenarios help you refine your abilities before you engage in serious action. An extremely well designed battle generator allows you set up nearly any type of battle you like. A map and order of battle editor make Rising Sun even more versatile in setting up your own battles.   Rising Sun also comes with a whole new set of maps that beautifully represent the terrain of the Pacific. Divided roughly into two categories -- temperate and tropical -- the twenty-odd map tiles are very well modeled and influence visibility, morale and combat. Kunai, which we know as elephant grass, helps to hide your units while city tiles increase their morale. In addition to the basic land types, there are 19 other map items -- roads, rivers, walls and the like -- that must be taken into consideration. Notable among these items is the reef, which severely hampers amphibious landings. Most fascinating are the cave tiles that function as fortifications and double, for the Japanese units, as a means of transportation. This ability to hop from one cave to another can cause no end of confusion among the US and British forces.  New rules for the game include two factors very integral to the Pacific War -- night fighting and Banzai attacks. No, not armies made up of little trees. That's bonsai. Banzai is best shouted at the top of your lungs while waving a sword above your head and running full force into your boss's office. Banzai attacks will begin with a morale check. The units involved attack at triple their strength and suffer no terrain penalties. To balance out the strength of this tool units which participate in a Banzai attack suffer more than the usual fatigue levels.  The Pacific setting is a welcome change from the preponderance of European battlefields in WWII wargames. While I'm not saying that I'd rather eat a sandwich that's been under the house for three weeks than sit through another Battle of the Bulge game, too much attention has been focussed on the European theater of the war. This is especially puzzling given the standing of battles like Guadalcanal and the Philippines. Thankfully, TalonSoft has finally decided to correct this bias. Although the game still might put off the more moderate gamers, fanatics will find more than enough here to satisfy their gaming jones.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Feb 15, 2000"}
