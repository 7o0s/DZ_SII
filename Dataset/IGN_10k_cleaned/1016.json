With Earth 2150, it looks as if TopWare and Mattel Interactive finally got it right, and added a lot more than just a pretty 3D terrain to the RTS mix. And while Earth 2150 is the best 3D RTS we've seen in years, this is an in-depth game for hardcore strategy fans who are looking for a return to the classic RTS feel.  So what makes Earth 2150 so intricate?  For starters, it's not like you only have one simple goal in Earth 2150.  No, no my dear readers.  Instead you have a set of overall campaign goals as well as individual mission goals.  Hopefully you've already read our preview of Earth 2150, but in case you're not familiar with the backstory, let me give you a very brief recap.  By the year 2150, the populace of Earth has split into three separate factions: the enterprising yet slothful United Civilized States (UCS), the conventional Eurasian Dynasty (ED), and the technologically-advanced yet relatively small Lunar Corporation (LC).  While both the UCS and the ED are content to live on the surface of the earth, the members of the LC colonized the moon many years ago to escape the earth-bound oppression.  Well wouldn't you know it.  Now the Earth is spinning off its axis and is heading toward the sun, pulling the moon with it.  Jeez, can't the LC ever catch a break?  The three factions now have 183 days to escape the Earth and set up a base on Mars if they want to save their civilization.   Life's a bitch, huh?  So how do you go about accomplishing this goal?  Well, like I mentioned before, your goal is to escape the surface of the Earth or moon to avoid becoming part of the biggest nuclear reaction in the solar system.  This means you have to raise enough capital to transport your people to Mars.  Now, for the UCS and the ED, this is a lofty task, so you have to raise at least 1,000,000 credits before the Earth plummets into the sun.  Since the LC are more technically proficient than the UCS and ED, they only have to raise 500,000.  Sure, it's half as much, but it's still a bit of a problem since that means they have to travel back to the surface of the Earth to do some good old-fashioned mining.   You start off the game with a fully functional base and you'll move from location to location gathering resources in your bid for a Mars conquest.  Since you'll often have to defend your resource fields by building a secondary base, this means you're often running both your main base as well as your mission base at the same time, so you have to have nimble fingers as well as a quick brain to keep up with all the action on-screen--or on multiple screens as the case may be.  To aid you in your multiple-base management, you can view the action in a variety of multiple camera setups.  This can be a daunting task at first, but once I got the hang of it I actually enjoyed managing both bases, using the main for unit production while my transport ferried units over to the mission area while my secondary bases were primary resource drainers that sucked the Earth dry and transported my hard-earned credits back to my main base.  The multiple bases and goals also bring into play the importance of good money management.  While you can opt to send everything you gather to your space base, it's often wise to hold on to a good chunk of your credits until the end of the mission until you know you don't need to build any new units or buildings, or research any new technologies.  Credits are used for everything in this game, and if you redirect too many to your space port, you may very well find yourself stuck unitless, without a penny in the bank, and with a horde of tanks rolling into your base.  Trust me, it happened to me more than once when I got too overzealous with my race to build a base on Mars.  I did appreciate how much the money management aspect makes you balance your spending, though, and it added a new twist to the otherwise overplayed RTS genre.   As with most modern RTS games, you keep your units at the end of each mission, and they'll gain experience with each battle fought.  I like this recent addition to the RTS genre, and it certainly seems more realistic in this futuristic setting with huge transport ships that can carry units from one base to another in a matter of seconds.  Research in the game is little more than a matter of time and money.  If you have the money, then your scientists will take a certain amount of time to research the next item in your tech tree.  When you research a new chassis or weapon, you can use these newly developed techs to build your army, which is comprised of land, air, and sea units.  Unit construction is very similar to Warzone 2100 in that you pick a chassis, an accompanying firearm, and your boys are ready to start production of your new implement of death.  The whole unit construction process is really quite streamlined, and is as easy as clicking your mouse button three times.  Graphically, not many games can compete with Earth 2150.  It's absolutely beautiful, and the unit and building detail is some of the best I've seen in any RTS game.  It's really the little visual touches that stand out in Earth 2150.  Everything you've always wanted to see in a military RTS can be found in the game.  For example, not only can you mount weapons on your buildings (and you can actually see them if you zoom in close enough), but you can also turn your base and units lights on and off.  Hell, the power plants even belch smoke that shifts with the wind.  This game is just amazingly detailed.  The designers even tailored the menus to coincide with each of the three factions, so you get a very utilitarian looking menu with the ED, while the LC menu looks very futuristic and flashy.  Sure, the units and buildings look great, but the folks at TopWare didn't skimp on the natural environments, either.  As you count down from your 183 day deadline, you'll go through complete day/night cycles, and the game's impressive weather effects really add a lot to the overall game, and create situations that you have to react to strategically.  Rain will literally pour down and obstruct your view, fog will roll in and conceal areas of the map, and driving snow will dance and blow in the wind.  All in all, the weather effects are lovely, and really add a lot to the atmosphere of the game.  Plus as you get closer to the sun, you'll notice the ice and snow starts melting and the earth begins to get hotter and hotter.  Controlling the game is simple once you get the hang of it.  The interface is complicated at first, but that's because there are so many options.  Personally, this is why I like computer games.  I want to be able to do more than five things in a game, and Earth 2150 certainly offers up a wide variety of tasks for you to control.  Like I said, the intricate menu system can be overwhelming in the beginning, but RTS fans should be able to jump in and control their units right off the bat, and the in-game tutorials do a decent job of getting you up to speed on the rest of the tasks at hand.  Unit pathing, something that can be the bane of any RTS, is pretty good in Earth 2150, and your units will generally listen to you and make decent combat decisions when left to their own devices.  While I did see a few units get overrun by overwhelming foes while following a wounded enemy into a trap, I was impressed with the AI overall and it's certainly as good if not better than any other modern RTS out there.  Surprisingly enough for a 3D RTS, the camera control is easy and effective in this game.  While most 3D games can be ruined with poor camera controls, Earth 2150 uses an intuitive keyboard/mouse combination that I picked up on in a matter of seconds after loading the game for the first time.  My only complaint about the camera system is I wish that the camera zoomed out more.  Sometimes in huge battles I couldn't keep track of all of my units because I couldn't see them all on the screen at the same time, and that's a bad thing when you hear ~unit lost, unit lost~ and you don't see anyone blowing up.  This game is deep, and quite literally.   If you don't like what's happening on the surface world, dig a few tunnels and send your units behind the enemy base for a sneak attack.  This is especially effective in multiplayer games against some poor sap who's only paying attention to the above ground action.  You can also deform and build structures such as bridges, which are obviously useful to cross bridges, onto the terrain.  Earth 2150 really did get the whole 3D terrain thing down right, and not only is it advantageous to have the high ground, but it also means something when you build your base behind an impassible mountain for defense.  On the auditory side of things, the dynamic classical soundtrack is brilliant and really fits the mood of the action, but the unit voices are often goofy and the sound effects are subdued and in the background, even at full volume.  Personally if I was a military general and I had a bunch of folks from the LC working for me, I'd quit my job in disgrace--at least that's what I gathered after hearing their voices.  They just sound too perky, and not eager enough to die for the cause.  I mean, how many times can you hear an excited 14-year old girl shout ~okay~ when you send her off the her death without feeling just a little guilty?  Gamers shouldn't be disappointed with Earth 2150 if they're looking for a good multiplayer game either.  While I haven't found anyone online to play with yet, the LAN matches around the office have been pretty intense so far.  There are six multiplay types in Earth 2150:    Uncle Sam No need to worry about gathering resources here.  You start out with an allotment of credits and you receive a steady stream of money throughout the game.  The first one to wipe out all of the competition is declared the victor.   Earn Money Like the name implies, the goal of the game is to collect as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time.   Kill 'Em All Yeah, you guessed it.  Your standard deathmatch with all functions enabled.   Arena Another variation of deathmatch, only Arena is a pure toe-to-toe battle with no bases, resources, or research.   Destroy Structures One of the favorites here at IGNPC.  It's like Kill 'Em All except your goal is to destroy all of your opponent's buildings.  This one can get ugly, and it also has the most pre-game options like mining on/off and various victory conditions.   Hide-n-Seek Another favorite, Hide-n-Seek is similar to capture the flag, except you only have to touch an opponent's flag to get a point.  You can bet that flag's going to be heavily defended, though.   Overall we were impressed with how evenly the units were balanced in multiplay considering how different the three factions feel in the single player game, and no one faction has a clear advantage over the other, although the ED can be devastating in a head-on attack.    As much as I enjoyed the depth and new strategies I found in Earth 2150, it does have a few minor problems which detract slightly from an otherwise excellent game.  Because of the complexity of the game, the mission objectives aren't always as clear as they could be.  I like things spelled out for me, and I often found myself hunting and pecking to find out exactly what I was supposed to in certain missions.  This made some missions longer than they needed to be and was a tad frustrating at times, but it didn't take away much from the game and it usually didn't slow me down too much.  It's also quite choppy on slower systems, especially with the details turned all the way up.  While you can adjust the graphical detail of the game and turn off the weather effects, which significantly speeds the game up, much of the charm of Earth 2150 lies in its visual acuity, so you may be disappointed if you have a slower system.  Earth 2150 is a brilliant strategy game that really uses the 3D terrain to its fullest. It's not for casual gamers though.  You have to be willing to invest some time in Earth 2150 to learn how to play effectively.  Yes, it will take a while to master, but its depth and elegance more than pay you back for the time invested.  While it's not perfect, Earth 2150 is one of the finest examples of a classically-styled RTS I've seen in years, and I look forward to more out of TopWare in the future.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
