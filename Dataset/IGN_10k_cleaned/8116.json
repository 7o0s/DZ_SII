{"name": "Q*bert", "name_review": "Q*Bert Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/24/qbert-review", "text": "It's fitting that two of Q*bert's main foes are named ~Ugg~ and ~Wrong Way,~ because it sums up what it's like to play the 25 year-old actioner rather nicely. Though it may benefit from an HD resolution and online Leaderboards, Sony's revamp of Gottlieb's famous Noser proves that you can't always go home again -- especially when that home has unresponsive character movement right along with it.   But let's be candid: Q*bert never had great controls to begin with. Even at the height of Q's popularity in the ~Yuppie~ decade, navigating his block-based pyramid was just as much a struggle against the joystick as it was against the AI. That sentiment rings true in the PlayStation 3 version as well, since most of the coin-op's difficulties with locomotion have been retained.   The pyramids are still fun, but the control still sucks. The reason that the preservation of the original's movement is so frustrating is because pushing a specific direction on the analog stick doesn't necessarily mean that you'll move where intended. Worse yet, it's not uncommon to get stuck mid-hop only to be clobbered by an opponent because you didn't hit the exact diagonal sweet spot. Plus, even though I was hopeful that the included Sixaxis support would make things feel a little tighter, it actually made things shoddier. Trust me when I say that you don't want to turn the tilt option on at all. It offers the most inaccurate compatibility of any PS3 game yet, and seems almost random in how it reacts to gestures.   Honestly, I find it quite a shame that Q*bert suffers from such poor control because it does have an addictive quality to it. Granted, the source of that addiction is somewhat intangible, but it is there. Perhaps the fun comes from the simplicity of the game's concept; as finding the proper way to change all the blocks of your pyramid to a certain color before foes take you out is surprisingly amusing. And even despite the fact that enemies use near-indistinguishable patrol patterns regardless of what you do, it can still be entertaining to avoid them for an hour or two.Unfortunately, an ~hour or two~ is all most people will want to spend with Q*bert because of his control problems. I can understand the need to preserve the original game's integrity, but keeping the same joystick hitches 25 years later actually damages its simple-but-fun gameplay design. Nostalgic fans will no doubt enjoy it more than most, but unless you grew up with him, Q*bert's five dollar cost is better spent towards something else.", "date": "Feb 24, 2007"}
