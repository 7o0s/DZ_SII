Scratch that, I'm livid. Midway through my review, I received a wonderful message from my game. It was pretty much the same result as an old DOS4GW stack dump midway through some of the older DOS-games in the mid '90's- a screenfull of text and numbers meets your confused gaze immediately after watching you game cut to black. Guess what folks, Crusaders of Might and Magic isn't done. If it was, I wouldn't be getting game crashes. Crashes happen in betas or near-final builds, but NOT finals. And guys, I was reviewing a final.   But joy of joys, this wonderful crash was not the first bug I encountered, merely the straw that broke my jaded back. Before the ill-fated event, I was treated to sound dropouts, stunted speech, and the wonderful experience of walking into inky blackness never to see my character again. Well, not at least until I reset my PlayStation. Now lest you think this was because of a faulty of overheating PS, allow me to lay this little nugget on you: I tried out two different builds on two different PlayStations, both properly ventilated.    It's really unfortunate, though, because I was enjoying myself marginally, and on my way to genuinely liking the game before all of this happened. Crusaders places you in the shoes of Drake, a man whose youth was interrupted by the ransacking of his village by the Legion. The Legion is a group of undead creatures led by Necros, a necromancer of incredible power and blah, blah, blah. The backstory honestly isn't important because it all leads up to these simple facts: a recently turned undead knight scarred Drake's face, his family was killed by the Legion (both happened when he was young), and he wants revenge. That's right, the whole motivation behind the story is revenge. Well, with a plot device like that, you can tell where the game was headed.   Gameplay A certain three-initialed magazine was quoted as saying, ~Finally a medieval Tomb Raider!~ Guys, if this game resembles Tomb Raider in anything but cameras and a few moves, I'm smoking crack on a consistent basis. Granted, the control scheme is the same in movements, but Drake's overall movement speed is much faster. Unfortunately, the area where the control should be tightest, the combat, is sorely lacking on response time. At times, a full second can elapse between a button press and actual action, and when you're in the thick of combat, this usually spells death (not to mention a 5-10 second wait for the reload from your last savegame). Drake flips and turns much like Lara, but that's about it.    The interface is a bit clunky, and the info on-screen is basically useless. There's a friggin' bar graph that shows you how much mana and life you have. It's just retarded. In fact, unless you enable it in the options screen, the graphs fade away after a few seconds of their being affected (whether by a hit or restore in the bars). The inventory system is likewise cumbersome. You hit select to open it, then each of the shape buttons to select the various parts of your inventory; triangle for spells, x for items, square for weapons, circle for shields. Once at your desired section you bring the object you want to select/equip to the foreground, and then hit select again to exit. Because the menus don't save what item you have selected in the other ~shapes~ sections, you have to individually select each thing you want to use/equip/whatever.   Combat is handled via simultaneous button and direction presses for the weapons and a half-tap/half-hold triangle button press for the spells. L2 can be used to auto-target an enemy, but if they drop out of you line of sight, you'll lose the tracking, making it essentially useless. When you do manage to select the enemy, a colored ring appears at their feet that identifies their elemental type (earth, wind, water, fire, light, dark), and their health -- the higher the ring, the more health.   The actual storyline simply consists of your character running around completing quests (read: running errands). It's repetitive, and lame. There are quite a few races, though, and the world seems to be pretty fleshed out, but if you're not truly interacting with the world, it's not being used properly. Such is the case with Crusaders.   Graphics Once again, 3DO's brand of muddled, grainy texture work comes into play. I'm getting REALLY tired of seeing all of 3DO's games sharing the same basic textures. Fortunately, some of the more exotic worlds (like the ice and forests) are a bit more diverse than I'm used to seeing from the three-lettered development house. If they can keep it up with their other games, while finding a way to clean up the look of them, they might actually kick out some attractive games.   The spell effects are still lame, though. It's obvious that 3DO's developers are in love with translucency effects, because they're used all over the place in their games. From simple weapon and shield switches to throwing axe lobs, a translucency effect or six is tacked on, and it really gets old after a few minutes. Likewise, the particle effects can get repetitive, but they're not used nearly as much.   Some of the level designs can be nice, especially considering they're just dungeons. It's pretty obvious that the engine used was made for more indoor environments because any outdoor area is quickly bound in by either a physical wall or short draw distance.   Animations just might be Crusaders' strongest graphic plus. The individual weapon animations are rather smooth, and a sword swing is executed differently than say a mace or hammer. As you gain proficiency with a weapon, follow-up moves can be tacked on (e.g. a simple thrust will be added to an overhead hammer swing after you hit level 5 with it), but they don't really seem to do any damage. The enemies also swagger accordingly; dwarves waddle, ogres lumber, and Drake sprints with a nicely executed flair.   Sound Crusaders' music runs the gamut from annoying to near moving. Some of the softer stuff is bland and uninteresting, but the harder, more driving beats mixed in with some grinding guitar riffs actually do a good job of getting you pumped.   Likewise, the voice acting is simply awesome  when the speech isn't clipped before the ends of sentences. Drake sounds like a genuine badass, the women sound hot, and some of the races are executed perfectly. (Why is it that dwarves always speak with a Highland accent? Oh well.)   Ahhh, but it wouldn't be a crappy 3DO game with out equally crappy effects, and Crusaders delivers. The effect sound like they were sampled at about 8KHz, lacking any high range crispness or low range fullness. They simply sound flat, in fact worse than some cart effects.  3DO could learn a thing or two from the fellas on their own Air Attack team; Kudo Tsunoda and company took a series that had no life and injected fun into it. While Crusaders tries to deliver a fun, fast paced experience, it ends up being sub-par. If more attention had been paid to making the fighting more enjoyable, this would have been a MUCH better game.", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
