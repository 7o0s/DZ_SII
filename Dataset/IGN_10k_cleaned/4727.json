Do you have the skill to be a Ribbit King? Can you defeat countless opponents in a Frolf tournament? Do you even know what Frolf is? These are the kind of questions you need to ask yourself before embarking on the adventure that is Ribbit King -- a title that's focuses on the bizarre rather than  gameplay.   Blending the sport of frog growing with golf, Ribbit King sets you on the path of glory and self discovery. You, a person who knows nothing about the sport of Frolf, must save your planet by winning the Frolf Championship. The crisis? Hippitron (your home world) is running out of the essential, scarce, and expensive fuel called Ribbinite -- without it, the planet is doomed to die. Fortunately, the Championship's prize is Super Ribbinite (concentrated Ribbinite in just the right quantity to save Hippitron). So, it's up to you and a talking picnic basket to take on the universe's greatest Frolf players and hope that you come out on top.  Like the call of Sirens, the premise of Ribbit King is so odd that few can resist its charm. Of course, those that enter Ribbit King's loving embrace will stumble upon more than they bargained for.    Features A new way to play golf Win the Frolf Championship in story mode 1-4 player versus mode Collect items and frogs to improve your chances Hidden characters to unlock Bonus disc filled with unlockable Frolf related movies Gameplay If you peel away all of Frolf's froggy trimmings, you'll find a game that closely resembles golf. The object is to eventually sink a frog into a well (or hole). However, courses aren't littered with simple water or sand traps. Frolf courses are filled with spider web trampolines, whirl pool warps, giant mushrooms, elephants, frog eating snakes, pterodactyls, conveyer belts, ice slides, lava, bombs, and much, much more. But, few of these hazards actually hurt you.  Unlike normal golf games, Ribbit King has you competing for the most points (instead of lowest stroke count). You only play against one opponent at a time, and the winner is determined by total points earned over the course of three or four rounds. Points are awarded by sending your frog through point bubbles or interacting with numerous obstacles. Skilled Frolf players will line up a chain of interactions for more points, like sending your frog into a point bubble, having him land in water, swim to the other side where he hops onto a spider web and is flung into the air, upon landing he spots a fly and eats it, lands too close to an elephant and is sent flying into the air, and finally comes to rest under a storm cloud -- racking upwards of 600 points. To fully understand it, check out the videos. But most turns end with no more than 50 points, so you'll have to weigh how many turns you take mucking about (the max is 10) versus sinking your frog early for a frog-in bonus. The bonus begins between 1000 and 1500 points (dependent on the course) and decreases with each turn you take.    Your Frolf experience is accompanied by some rather clever and charming cut scenes. Before each match, Scooter will meet with his opponent. These exchanges are always humorous and will make you smile simply because they're so random -- and unexpected. Scooter's first meeting with Pan-Pan the Panda will convert the game screen into that of a fighter. Right before Pan-Pan sends a karate chop into our hero, Scooter reminds him that they're here to play Frolf. Pan-Pan hangs his head in defeat. When he meets with Princess Tippi, she's too tired to play Frolf. After a ~power nap,~ she agrees to play with Scooter. Instead of going to the Frolf course, she passes out. Scooter remarks, ~She should eat more spinach.~   Collecting is the last component of Frolf. With each victory, you'll be awarded a trophy (50 in all). Also, at the end of each victorious match you'll be given the opportunity to purchase an item from your opponent. These items will either enhance your frog's performance or they'll allow you to grow a new frog with predetermined attributes (like one that can withstand lava or one that isn't affected by electricity or oil.) It isn't as deep as the collecting in Pokemon, but collecting all trophies or frogs is something to strive for. Also, completing various objectives, like sinking 10 frogs-in-one, will unlock bonus video clips. These are just as bizarre as the cut scenes and have nothing to do with the game -- such as frogs plotting to overthrow the Frolfers.  An unusual/wacky take on the sport of golf, Ribbit King has all the needed ingredients for an amusing and different golfing experience. Unfortunately, all the wackiness and charm in the world don't make Ribbit King a fun way to the pass the time. Ribbit King does require minimal skill -- such as mastering the swing meter, judging how far your frog will hop upon landing (determined by distance and frog's stamina), and how the frog will react to various obstacles (where he'll be flung to). It's possible to line up a chain of ten or twelve reactions with proper planning, distance, and power for 800 points in a single shot. But the likelihood of your skills paying off is slim. You can scour the course for a string of points, send your frog at them, and easily have one interaction backfire and send your frog out of bounds (losing points). Attempt the same shot again and your frog might cooperate, or go in a completely different direction. Or you could arbitrarily hit the frog and end up accumulating a ton of points.     Luck plays far too large a factor to keep things interesting. At the end of each match, a secret bonus is rewarded to the player that excelled at whatever at the secret bonus criteria was. So, after you've finished the match you'll learn that ~100 points goes to the drive king~ (or some other random criteria). But, because you aren't told before hand (it is a secret after all) there's no way to know who will receive the bonus, or even work towards getting the bonus during the match. While the points aren't an issue early in the game when the A.I. is incredibly easy, after a few hours with Ribbit King you'll notice that you're only winning matches by a matter of 100 points rather than 1000+. Then, those few bonus points will be the difference between you progressing or having to sit through the same 20 minute match again (where the A.I. will make the same strokes).   The other rather large problem is that you spend far too much time not playing. Once you've sent your frog on its way, the game is out of your control. You have to watch as it hops across the course, get trampled by an elephant, falls into a whirlpool, etc. until it finally stops moving. At first this isn't so bad because the animations are cute -- but seeing them once or twice is enough.  The only thing to prevent you from reading a novel while you wait for your turn to end is that you'll occasionally have to wiggle the left thumb stick or hit a button after a count down to receive points instead of losing them.   It gets worse. Once your turn is over, you then must watch the computer's turn. The entire round is played out for you in painstaking detail -- complete with the computers ~wiggling or pressing~ mini-games. It feels like you exchange 30 seconds of actual gameplay for every ten minutes of watching (in reality it's closer to two). Even playing against fellow humans fails to make time pass faster. The experience is best described as playing a version of Mario Party that doesn't contain any mini-games.  Graphics Ribbit King's art style is one that will appeal to fans of Animal Crossing. While the character designs are rather simple, their quirky nature works very well with such an odd title and they look good in cut scenes. Unfortunately, the art work doesn't hold up in game -- especially when you're looking at objects up close. The most noticeable attribute is bland, stretched textures. Objects appear aliased. Flat objects don't holdup well at all. There's clipping and occasionally bad camera placement. And, for a game that is so quirky, the color palette for the in game world is remarkably limited. However, a few things are done well, like Wind Waker-styled particle effects. Basically, the contrast between in game and lobby/cut scenes is so drastic that it accentuates the flaws in course art design.   Sound Ribbit King's audio track won't blow you away, but it's decent. The voice acting in the cut scenes is done well considering that this isn't a dialogue intensive game. There aren't any of the typical dubbing problems with delivery. The musical score is the sort of happy go lucky music you'd expect from this sort of game. It fits with the property. Sound effects include buzzing of flies, whirling of water, knocking sounds when you need to wiggle the thumb stick, and annoying hop effects. Cartoony in nature, the sound effects get very very old very very quickly. Besides for the voice acting, Ribbit King's sound will eventually drive you to TV muting.I was initially drawn to Ribbit King because of its quirky nature and Japanese charm. My mistake was spending time with it. Far too much time. The best way to describe Ribbit King is mind numbing. My main complaints are that there's too much dead time -- where you're forced to watch animations you've seen countless times again and again (there's no way to skip them) and the game is a lot more about luck than it is skill. It's also not fun to play (not a good thing). In fact, the gameplay has very few redeeming qualities besides for originality. The only thing Ribbit King has going for it are its cut scenes and cute art style, which are almost enough to charm you into playing (until you remember how long and painful the matches are). It's hard to recommend this beyond a rental -- and that's only to see how weird it is. I can't even recommend it as a title for a younger audience because of the difficulty curve and associated frustration.  Rent it if you're curious. But beware -- it's not a very ribbiting experience.", "date": "May 29, 2004"}
