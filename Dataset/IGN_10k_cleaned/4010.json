First with the brilliant-looking space combat title Darklight Conflict, and now they've worked their magic on Incoming, a strictly action-oriented PC game that just looks absolutely gorgeous, and manages to play a good game too.  The action jumps around a lot in the game, offering a wide variety of different vehicles and aircraft to pilot. There are many scenarios where it feels like a 3D version of Missile Command, where you take position behind a turret and simply blast wave after wave of invading forces before they destroy your base. In some missions, you'll pilot a chopper and deliver freight while fending off enemy ships. Others even require the use of maneuverable aircraft to plow the way for your convoy. The missions are both long and eventful, which is surprising for a game that places all its emphasis on twitch-style action.   We're not kidding about the graphics - this game will push your 3D accelerator hard. Incoming's got it all -- Realistic lighting effects, smooth mountainous terrain, slick plasma trails, and awesome explosions and debris raining all over the place.  But it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt - one high-end system would kick back to Windows with memory problems, another would lock up tighter than a drum at the title screen. And on one system, the filtered graphics would lose consistency, the gorgeous visuals would randomly snap into a weird, dithered, ugly mode where it looks like someone dropped a screen window in front of our monitor. After that happened we had to quit the game and restart, and yes, the cycle repeated.  The big deal is, we know we're not alone. You should see the huge list of questions about incompatibility problems on Rage's website. Funny thing is, most of the answers are ~It's not our fault,~ or ~Your drivers are incompatible with Incoming.~ Sorry, that's not going to cut it -- there should have been a lot more compatibility testing before they let this game out the door. The game is great, the hassles are not. If you can get this game to work problem-free, hey, more power to you. But chances are you're going to hit the same problems we did.  Incoming is an outstanding-looking and great playing game, but the system problems are a major drag. If only Rage focused as much time into compatibility testing as it did pushing the graphics, we wouldn't have much to complain about. -- Craig Harris", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
