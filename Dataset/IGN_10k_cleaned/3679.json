Do circles bore you to death? Are you tired of all those rude and obnoxious drivers who keep cutting you off or force you into cement walls? Eden Studios and Atari have rallied to your cries. Their solution is V-Rally 3, where you and your navigator tackle the untamed courses in European-influenced wonderlands.   For a sport that is rarely heard of or practiced in the United States, the fact that new rally games keep finding their way onto the Xbox is somewhat of a continual surprise. Xbox is already home to two distinguished rally racers, Colin McRae Rally 3 and Rallisport Challenge. With these contenders, what does V-Rally 3 bring to the Xbox to make it worthy of your time?   Gameplay  V-Rally 3 has all the basic features you'd find in other rally games. Tracks cover a range of locales such as Sweden, Finland, Germany, England, France, and Africa, and each locale contains four courses. Licensed rally cars such as the Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 7, Citroen Xsara, Ford Focus, and other main manufacturers make an appearance with a total of 16 different cars. Racing modes are broken down into two parts, V-Rally, which is the career mode, and Quick Race, which is divided into Attack and Challenge.    The Attack mode is a simple time attack where amazingly your goal is to break previous best times. Challenge mode is a variation on time attack, where you must complete at the least three tracks, fluctuating dependent on the challenge, in a certain amount of time. The catch with Challenge mode is that each challenge is linked to a specific car and you have to beat Challenge 1 to progress to Challenge 2, etc.   V-Rally mode is the meat of V-Rally 3. Your overall goal is to move from the 1.6L FWD category up to champion of the 2.0L 4WD category.  Your path of a rally car champion begins in the preseason, where you are sent emails by numerous teams offering you test drives. If you manage to complete a course under a given time without totaling the car, you will be offered a contract. In the contracts are a defined number of seasons you have to race for a given team and what position you need to finish in at the end of a rally. Succeed, and you will build up your reputation and be offered spots on better teams. Fail and you will be booted from your team and be forced to rebuild your status among your competitors.      When racing, V-Rally 3 feels like a cross between a simulation and an arcade racer, which gives V-Rally 3 a newbie friendly interface. The controls are very easy to pick up, and they follow a control scheme that has become standard among racers. You steer with the right analog stick steers, accelerate with the right trigger, and brake with the left trigger. Changing gears, if you're daring enough to race in manual, is done with X and A. And, for those all important power slides, the emergency brake is activated with B. You can change you view from behind the car to over the hood with Y.   Although all cars handle differently, steering remains a constant median between loose and tight steering. You have the option of taking them into the shop to be adjust the tires, chassis, and gearbox for different elemental conditions, V-Rally feels more like an arcade racer than a simulation, especially when compared to simulations like Colin McRae 3.    What perpetuates the arcade-like classification of the game, along with steering, is all the damage that can occur to your car while you're driving. I witnessed a lot of this during my not-so-collision free road tests. You can loose both front and rear bumpers and all the wheels to your car (which takes true talent). But, what is even more exciting is the internal damage you can accumulate, which can be anything from complete brake failure to a partially functioning transmission.     What aids in the total destruction of your car is that occasionally, if for some reason you stray from the road, you can ram into trees, rocks, and stone walls. It's disappointing that there weren't more things for a reckless driver like myself to ram. Also, some collisions don't affect your car the way they should. If you time your guard rail collisions correctly, you will smoothly be guided around a tight hairpin turn without significantly slowing you down or doing substantial damage to your car.     What irked me in V-Rally 3 is that if you flip your car, destroy you engine, or lose a wheel, unless the car completely stops running and breaks down, you are respawned. Whereas, if you drive off a cliff (which I can see as being parallel to flipping your car), your race is ended. The only other real oddity is in the difficulty of winning races. When you are starting out in V-Rally mode, it seems almost too easy to win rallies. Three hours into your career you can still easily win by thirty-second margins. You don't begin to feel the pressure of losing until you've spent at least eight hours building your reputation.    Graphics  The graphics in V-Rally 3 aren't great, but they aren't awful. Most of the focus was obviously placed on the car models since they are the focus of your attention. The cars themselves often seem a little too shiny and at times resemble plastic. But, you will notice hints of shadowing and reflection on your rear windshield and half attached bumpers will bounce as you speed along the course. Cars also come equipped with orangey plumes of smoke that trail from your engine block if you manage to start an engine fire and occasionally tires will kick up dirt or dust when you hit a hard turn. These environmental effects don't match the rest of the scenery and often look like cartoonish additions. V-Rally, for all the attention they gave the cars, they end up making their rally car models look like cheap Fischer-Price imitations.    The scenery also has its own mix of problems. When looking at objects in the distance they have a realistic quality, especially when you are being blinded by the sun. Foreground objects are what makes the illusion fall apart. The bushes and trees that you fly past look distinctly two dimensional and have very basic textures. When you pass crowds watching from the side of the road, they don't even look like poorly modeled individual people, but a poor representation of an undistinguishable mass. To spice up the scenery, occasionally a herd of animals will run across the road in distance. But, they aren't given enough detail, so you are left guessing whether they were deer, small dogs, or some other four legged animal.        The most surprising thing about the graphics was the video sequences that introduced each new race or after you make repairs in V-Rally. You'll get to witness the exact same animation of your crew prepping your car. All the character models are incredibly blocky and move in very rigid ways. The animation doesn't even correctly show the tires being attached. The team member will move the tire towards the car, and then magically it will appear on the axel. The screen also tends to glitch during the start of these sequences, causing a patch of the screen to blank out.      Sound  The most constant sound you'll hear during V-Rally 3 is the revving of your engine. This is primarily because there is no music soundtrack during a race, which is understandable because it would interfere with the shouts of your navigator warning of upcoming turns. The sound effects were one of the most immersive aspects of the game. I cringed when I heard the metallic jangling that signified break failure or the grinding of gears. Also, you can pick out the screeching of tires across gravel, pavement, and ice. There is just such a great range of sounds, anywhere from the loud crunching, crumpling sound of your car hitting trees to the soft thwapping of bushes you brush.    When you're not racing, but instead are faced with a variety of menu screens, you'll hear a tasteful, but short sampling of techno music.   Possessing a complete lack of knowledge in rally racing in real life, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from V-Rally 3. I was completely taken by surprise by how much I enjoyed racing through the wooded courses of England, the open dusty plains of Africa, and the snowy landscapes of Sweden. I will have to warn those looking for a serious rally racing simulation that you might want to keep looking. I dislike simulation games, and primarily stick to arcade racers like San Francisco Rush. I interpret the quickness and ease it took me to get accustomed to and enjoy V-Rally 3 as a racer as a sign that this arcade simulation hybrid is more arcade than sim.      I was pleased with the overall package that is V-Rally 3. How much longevity you can squeeze out of the title after you win V-Rally mode is questionable, but at least there are a decent amount of tracks to occupy you. The only real questionable characteristic of V-Rally 3 is the graphical inconsistencies.", "date": "May 29, 2003"}
