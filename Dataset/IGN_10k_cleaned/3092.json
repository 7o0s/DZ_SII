But to be realistic, the success of the movie is definitely a factor in the release of this game. The story of Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring of power has captivated an entirely new and larger audience thanks largely to Peter Jackson's film. But while this game is related to the movie in terms of timing, it boldly sets a new path and tries to offer an experience that's different from but complimentary to the film.   It includes lots of elements missing from the movie which is a really great decision. Not only does it differentiate this game from EA's Two Towers, it also broadens the appeal somewhat. Fans of the book will love the sequence where Tom Bombadil rescues the hobbits from Old Man Willow while fans of the movie will appreciate seeing Sam stare into Galadriel's mirror along with Frodo. The Barrow-Downs are also included as is Glorfindel's resumption of his role in rescuing the party after Weathertop.   But it does sadly leave out big important sections of the story which can make things sometimes seem a bit disjointed. I particularly like the fact that the Rivendell sequences ends, a title card pops up saying ~Later...~ and a new cutscene starts with Gandalf saying, ~Well, the mountain pass didn't work. What next?~ In some ways you really need to have seen, er, read the book to understand how one sequence leads to another.   There are a few deviations from the books as well. While attentive players will notice small discrepancies here and there, they don't detract from the game. In keeping with Gandalf's relatively minor role in the early action, it's now Tom Bombadil who suggests the hobbits visit the Prancing Pony. By far the worst of these deviations is the strange ending of the game. I won't give it away except to say that it leaves a great deal out and replaces it with an end boss that's strangely out of context.   But that's getting ahead of things. The intro itself is a bit too brief and the whole impetus of the journey seems to be missing. Apparently there's a thing with the ring and this creepy gray guy and somehow it all leads to the end of the world. Gandalf's in and out before you can say Mithrandir. And the brief intro is a sign of things to come. None of the sequences overstays its welcome. In fact, most are over far too quickly. From start to finish, this game took me about five hours to complete.   It progresses in a traditional third-person adventure format giving you pre-scripted access to three different characters -- Frodo, Aragorn and Gandalf. Frodo's sequences are the most puzzle oriented while Aragorn handles most of the combat. Gandalf falls somewhere in between with a few puzzle elements thrown in amongst the general carnage. Most of the time will be spent merely trying to get from one end of the level to the other either avoiding or defeating the monsters that come your way.   Although there are a few instances where getting lost is a real possibility (particularly in the early levels), most of the environments are quite linear. This is convenient because the map feature that's included with the game is really just an overland map that shows your current location on Middle Earth. Why someone would need to access that during the actual game is beyond me. Better to put it up during the load screens between missions so you could see the progress of your character.   The levels all involve typical quest stuff, at least at first. To begin with Frodo has to find the deed to Bag End so he can sell it to Lobelia. Once that's found he has to head out to find Lobelia. Along the way he runs in to a hobbit child who's stolen something from the mill. The mill-keeper tells Frodo that he's missing a pin and needs to find it to get the mill working again. A nearby farmer is having problems with his weathervane. Wasn't there something about escaping the Shire in there somewhere? It's nice to ease players in to the game but there's not much urgency in the first few tasks.   When the player switches to Aragorn in Bree he has to find Sam and then locate the parts needed to construct hobbit dummies to fool the Ring Wraiths. Strangely there aren't nearly as many differing objectives in the later levels. While the search for missing hobbits occupies you for a few moments every now and then, most of the later levels simply require you to reach the exit. There are also a few minor oddities in the quests themselves. In the second conversation you have with the hobbit child, he tells you where to find the missing pin, even if you've already found it and returned it to the mill.   Other than progressing to the next level, there aren't many rewards to be had here. In fact, all the levels contain (besides enemies) are health-boosting items (or magic in Gandalf's case). I've long since given up complaining that eating ham and apples heals you in most adventure games. While that concept is given somewhat better treatment here, running around looking for something called 'cram' still seems a bit out of place.   That holds true for the various switches and levers and blocks that you'll need to manipulate in Moria. It seems the dwarves were crazy for Tomb Raider-esque type puzzles. But unlike Tomb Raider most of the puzzles are almost immediately obvious. Switches are almost always right in front of the object they activate and little lines on the ground clue you in that there's a block to be pushed. Although the introductory tutorial teaches you how to climb up on ledges, I never found a use for the skill anywhere in the game.   The Ring of the title doesn't have much to do with the game either. There's one sequence where it's needed (and the game even tells you by placing a text message on the screen reading, ~The Ring???~) but otherwise it might as well not even exist. Frodo does have a purity meter that determines how long he can wear the ring but since he can outrun 90% of the monsters in the game and since the levels end once he reaches the exit, there's really very little benefit to being invisible. Maybe if Galadriel was taking a bath or something...   Combat is very basic with one melee attack and one ranged attack per character. Frodo carries a walking stick and an endless supply of rocks. The rocks are really only useful to distract enemies (like the deadly Ring Wraiths) but since they come in an unending supply, you can use them for whatever you'd like -- say, building a little dam or something. Aragorn also has a kick move that knocks enemies down, setting you up for a cool deathblow. Gandalf's deathblow is the best as he stabs the point of his staff down in the monster's face. Gandy's also got five spells to choose from -- a fiery blast and a lightning blast to take down enemies far away and a staff strike that knocks down all nearby enemies. One of his cooler moves is called attract and forces enemies to fight each other. Finally, a heal spell lets him regenerate health.    But you don't always need to fight. If you're not traveling alone, you can let the members of the fellowship (whichever ones happen to be there), beat the monsters for you. Try as I might (and try I did) I couldn't get any member of my party killed, no matter how reckless or negligent I was. This makes sense when Gimli is supporting Frodo in the mines of Moria, but when Aragorn has to clear the path for the hobbits, it seems stupid that he can do much better by standing back and letting them do all the work. Watching four hobbits take out two trolls gives you a newfound appreciation for their kind. Next time let's make a whole fellowship out of them and give the dwarves and elves a rest?   This also leads to one of the stranger and more arbitrary story elements. All of the characters are present in the cutscenes (at least after Rivendell) but they completely disappear once the action starts. Sometimes it's explained (or at least explicable), like when Gandalf and Gimli enter Moria. But then the action shifts so that you have control of Frodo and Gandalf sits out for a few sequences. It's too bad that more effort wasn't put in to making this make sense within the game and you're expected just to accept that the game wants you to take control of a specific character at a specific time.   A few years ago it was hard for many people to imagine the characters and settings in any way that differed from the conception of the Hildebrant brothers. And since the movie's been released, it's going to be even more difficult to find people willing to come to the game who don't already have these visual associations set in their minds. With that said, the artists here have done a really excellent job of creating a world that's similar enough to be familiar but distinct enough to stand on its own.   Even without those preconceptions, the character models are a bit hit or miss. Gandalf's the oddest with overly broad shoulders and a short cape and tunic in place of the expected robes. And while a burly Gandalf sounds neat, it's hardly canon. Personally I'm not fond of the look of the elves as it seems a bit too unrefined. The hobbits are dead-on though in terms of expression and proportion. Large hands and feet and big facial features really sell the illusion here. The enemy models are also all great. Things like trolls and orcs are uniquely realized and even things like wargs and giant spiders receive just as much attention and detail as the Ring Wraiths. The game gives him away a bit too easily but the Balrog is impressive. He isn't quite the fiery shadow as described in the books but he's scary nonetheless.   The visuals also provide a really strong sense of place for almost all of the game's sequences. The Shire looks really cool with lots of little hobbit gardens outside of hobbit holes. While locations such as the Prancing Pony and Rivendell are limited just to two rooms each, they each evoke a mood that's wonderfully appropriate for the moment. Heading through the forests or down into the deserted dwarven kingdom of Moria you'll get a real sense of place and character. Sadly the draw depth is a bit short even on the maximum setting but in most cases that actually works to reinforce the slightly misty character of the world. In the forest you'll find the flowers and trees quite convincing. The water's rendered merely as a very flat and static single layer and is definitely the weakest part of the environment.   While the Moria level is a nice interlude between the two large outdoor sections, it has it's own share of problems. The biggest is that the occasional low-ceilings and ubiquitous pillars present some real obstacles (literally) for the camera. Too often as a character backed against a wall, the camera would tilt up quite drastically affording me a view of nothing important. The camera unfortunately doesn't allow for much tilt in any case, making it hard to see what's above or below you -- unless of course you can run in to a wall or hill or something.   By far the weakest spot among the graphics are the cutscenes themselves. Most are rendered through the game engine and look fine. But every once in a while, when a moment comes up that requires a bit more expression or energy, the game switches to a pre-rendered set of scenes that look like they're from a totally different game. And the fact that they're done by a company known as Blur Studios should be a good indication of their quality. (Blur Studios has to rank right up there with Tasteless Cooking Academy and Earless Records for the ~With a name like ours, we have to be good~ award.)   Overall, the game's sound is really effective. The inclusion of things like Tom Bombadil's singing goes a long way in my book. Some of the editors around here have criticized the voice work and, although some of the readings are more caricature than character, I thought the overall delivery worked well. Monster sounds are almost all first-rate, from the growling of the wargs to the screams and howls of orcs as they come running towards you. The music itself is good but not overpowering enough to distract from the action. I was a bit confused by the lack of music during the credits sequence at the end of the game.   What did you think of Fellowship of the Rings?   One final comment needs to be made. The game has been unusually temperamental with regard to the systems it would run on, with some problems with the textures rendering it effectively unplayable. We've tried to quantify this finicky disposition and as best as we can tell the only common feature among all the systems that experienced this texture problem was the GeForce 3 card. On the GeForce 4, it had no such problems. We're hoping this is cleared up with a patch soon. Until then it makes more sense to try it out first if you can.  If you want a Lord of the Rings game for the PC, this is the one to get. But that's easy -- if you want a Lord of the Rings game for the PC, this is the only one available. And unless you're familiar with the book or movie, the game will seem a bit disjointed and hard to follow. It also seems to end in a very strange way, whether you've read the books or not. Obviously they're setting up for a sequel, but the end of the game seems abrupt and somewhat detached from the rest of the story.Beyond the story omissions, the game's also missing a few key features (multiple objectives for later levels, a use for the ledge climbing ability, music during the credits, etc.) that seem like they ought to have been included. This game is a rarity in the PC world in that it actually shipped on time (perhaps in anticipation of EA's game) so that might explain a few of the missing pieces.In any case, this is one to rent or borrow before buying. Once you've finished it though, there's not much reason to pick it up again.", "date": "Oct 22, 2002"}
