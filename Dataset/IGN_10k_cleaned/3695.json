{"name": "Chessmaster", "name_review": "Chessmaster", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/04/chessmaster-3", "text": "For God knows how many years now, the Chessmaster series of games have always been the best, and the most thorough. Honestly, it's hard to imagine a competing chess game that comes close to providing the chess experience that the Chessmaster games provide. But, as great as the games are, with the exception of a few minor tweaks and additions, the Chessmaster games have varied very little from each other. And so is the case with Chessmaster on the Playstation 2. But is this really a bad thing? No, not at all.  Gameplay Teacher. Mentor. Ultimate Opponent. These four words grace the cover of Chessmaster, and there is really no better way to describe the game. As much a chess teacher as it is a chess simulation, Chessmaster's tutorials are well thought out and in-depth. From basic piece functions, to standard offensive strategies, to sophisticated defensive concepts, Chessmaster leaves no stone unturned. And not only are the tutorials numerous, they are of excellent quality. We can thank Bruce Pandolfini (among others), one of America's most well-known chess teachers, for this as just about every piece of information and strategy is authored by him, or someone of equal caliber, including John Nunn, Larry Evans, and Yasser Seirawan. In case you have any doubts to Pandolfini's abilities, he was Josh Waitzkin's teacher, the chess boy wonder who was featured in the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. If that's not an impressive claim, we don't know what is.  Chessmaster features a wealth of modes to choose from, whether you're looking to rise the ranks at the local park chess matches, or play in a 3d battlefield with a friend as animated pieces slaughter each other with little remorse. But the biggest draw of Chessmaster on the PS2 may be its online mode. Being able to play chess with a buddy at home is a great, but being able to play chess with a buddy (or a stranger) thousands of miles away is even better. Outside of the game tutorials and standard chess game, there are also over 800 famous games that players can watch move by move with commentary. In addition to this, there are single-move puzzles to solve, and drills and exams that can be completed and scored. What? Exams? Yes, exams. And as surprising as it may sound, these exams can go a long way when trying to refine your chess skills.    Our main complaint with Chessmaster is the sometimes unwieldy interface. Navigating through the game's menus and tutorials can sometimes be a chore, as the interface lacks a user-friendly UI. But, when it comes to the actual game, Chessmaster delivers, and delivers big. And that's what really counts in the end, isn't it?  Graphics From a visual standpoint, there is very little that is appealing about Chessmaster; the menus and tutorials are slightly more appealing than the front cover of your VCR manual. Granted, the 3d models for the chess pieces are well done, but come on, this is chess. The graphics are more function than flash, but honestly, that's fine by us. And some of the different chess piece sets are amusingfor a bit. There were only so many games we could play using the dog-themed pieces that feature Chihuahuas as pawns. Still, the availability and option to change up the pieces is much needed, and much appreciated.   Then there are the Battlefield games of chess. These games use animated 3D figures in a way that attempts to simulate a battle of some sort -- think of the futuristic board game Luke plays in the Star Wars movie. Rather than a board, the game appears to take place in a 3D environment as pieces run, jump, and stab each other as an opponent's piece is taken. And while far from revolutionary, the pieces are animated well and the change in setting helps keep the monotony of a standard chess board to a minimum.    Sound Is there really much to say here? The background music is soft, relaxing, and does a fantastic job of mimicking the new age sounds of Yani. Well, we wouldn't take it quite that far, but those of you who only caught a few winks the night before may want to turn the volume off as the soothing tones bring sleep faster than a simulated three weeks of E3. The majority of the game's aural stimulation will come from the voiceovers used in the tutorials and during play. Fortunately, the voice, like the music, is not intrusive and leaving it on is not nearly as irritating as it could be. In fact, some beginners may prefer to leave the voice on as it dictates each move that is made. Overall, nothing to hate, but nothing to really get excited about either. Chessmaster is without a doubt the best chess game available on the PS2. Granted, it's the only chess game, but the Chessmaster series has been reining king of chess games for a number of years now, and it doesn't look as if that's going to change anytime soon. The inclusion of online play sweetens the deal even more, making the number of human opponents available theoretically limitless. Anyone with even a slight interest in chess owes it to themselves to check out Chessmaster. There really is no better teacher, mentor, or opponent (that's not a human, of course) out there. Only those that have previous versions of the game on varying platforms may want to pass on Chessmaster for PS2. Get it, learn it, play it.", "date": "Jun 4, 2003"}
