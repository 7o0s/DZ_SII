Not only does it work really well, but it changes the way you play games in fundamental ways. Rather than using a controller to input actions, you use your arms, body and whatever else you can wave and move around to control the onscreen action.   EyeToy: Operation Spy sees player don their night vision goggles and attempt to take down a series of criminals by cracking codes, using facial recognition software and skydiving into their headquarters. While the game has a cool premise and does a few of these things reasonably well, some of the other minigames that make up the overall missions make no use of the EyeToy's excellent input scheme.    After setting yourself up with a top secret ID and have scanned your face for security purposes (which prevents your friends from logging into your high security profile), you embark on a series of minigames to catch random criminals. Each of these minigames only lasts for maybe a minute or so, and a few out of the set are chosen for each mission. You'll always need to match the criminal's face and get some aerial location data, but the rest of the games mix up a bit for each criminal.   Some of the minigames are reasonably cool, like the code breaking segments. You'll see what looks like a multi-sided die in the center of the screen (anything from six sides up to who knows how many), and your goal is to rotate the die to the designated sides without catching any of the armed sides, which will cost you a time penalty and you'll have to start over. The cool part is that you manipulate two sliders on either side of the screen with your hands to rotate the object. It sort of feels like something out of Minority Report, and once you get the hang of it, the code breaking segments work pretty well and make nice use of the EyeToy.   The skydiving segments are also reasonable, though they're really not any more complicated than Pilot Wings. Of course, sky diving isn't really very complicated since you're just falling and using your arms to change speed and direction, so there's not much more they could have added. Just as with the code breaking minigames, you use your arms on either side of the screen and essentially act out what you want your onscreen persona to do. So if you want to move forward quickly, you put your arms by your side, but you need to raise your arms to slow down and move back a little. Like the code breaking stuff, the input system works exactly as you'd expect it would and does a decent job of making you feel like you're the spy falling to his death. There are unfortunately no splatter animations should you fail to pull your chute, but oh well.   There are a few other games like these that work well, though there are just as many that don't. The world map sequences, where you have to move a square marker over highlighted points of interest to nail down the location of your target, would generally require nothing more than a directional pad to work. All you're doing is pressing buttons on the screen, so it's not much more in terms of interaction than a menu system.    Likewise, the Photo Fit segments, were you have to swap through a series facial parts and match them to a reference video, use a simple arrow-based input system as well, where all you're doing is pressing buttons. It's not even an interesting minigame, and the fact that it does nothing to make use of the EyeToy's theoretically infinite input potential, well, that's just a waste.   There are few gimmicky but reasonably cool or fun security features and standalone minigames. For instance, you can set up your EyeToy to pick out intruders, who have to get their faces scanned to pass the ID check. Some of the random minigames, like Minefield, has you point your EyeToy at the ground and set up a few mine hotspots and a prize to collect. There are a few games like this that are reasonable fun, but they get old pretty fast.EyeToy: Operation Spy is a mash of minigames, half of which are decent and half of which waste the EyeToy's potential, offering up only the most basic input possible. There's some fun to be had here, but you're probably better off sticking with some of the much better EyeToy titles.", "date": "Nov 18, 2005"}
