However, unlike giant robots, cute Japanese girls in schoolgirl outfits and Dance Dance Revolution, Torneko is not something that completely deserves all of the praise that it has received. For the game is nothing more than another Nethack with very little to no substance that makes it worth raving about.    Gameplay  Torneko: The Last Hope does have a story, as it follows the adventures of tubby shopkeeper named Torneko, but the story is pretty much irrelevant in the whole scheme of things because this game's focus is its multiple randomly generated mazes. There are story elements in between each of the dungeons that help give reasons as to why you're going in them and explain what's happened in them, but the story lacks depth, is completely silly and is just completely inconsequential.   That said, the story is of a dungeon exploration game like this never has been a focal point and Torneko never tries to pretend like it's a grand adventure like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. It is exactly what it intends to be, a dungeon exploration game that has you traverse a bevy of randomly generated dungeons on a quest to find various items that include weapons, shields, staffs, scrolls, rings, projectiles, pots, herbs, bread, chests and keys.   And like other games of this kind, such as Azure Dreams and Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, Torneko takes on a psuedo realtime movement and combat system that has the player move around the screen in a realtime fashion, while all the onscreen characters including the player are basically all moving one step per turn. What this basically means is that the game can't turn into a Diablo-esque button mashing fest as the monsters will move one space or attack for every time that Torneko moves or attacks and if Torneko isn't moving, neither will the monsters. While the battles are fairly easy for the most part, there will be times where Torneko will be put up against some seemingly insurmountable odds that require a great deal of strategy and resolve to overcome.   Torneko also makes us of some new and streamlined features that help make its quest far more enjoyable and less tedious than it would have been without them. First, the game seems to incorporate many of the features that are now standard in games of this kind, such as the ability to meld items, plus it gives players an extra incentive to play the game different ways in order to fill out all of the listed mini-events. To complete these, players will have to do a variety of oddball things that include getting Torneko killed in every way possible, eliminating a priest, and even robbing another shopkeeper.   In addition, the game features an excellent auto-map feature that is superimposed over the game screen and keeps track of the layout of the level in realtime and even lets players know where monsters are positioned at. This excellent auto-map feature combined with the ability to sprint through the levels helps make it possible to traverse through some of the levels at breakneck speeds and takes a little away from some of the tedium commonly involved with a game of this type.   However, none of the game's cool features or oddball story elements that come into play really help bring the game out of the real of boredom. Yes, the dungeons are completely random and the replay value can be considered quite limitless, but the truth is that most people just won't want to play the game for that long of a time because it's completely unrewarding. Because of the lack of a solid story base and the fact that Torneko starts off each new dungeon at the same level, the player isn't ever really rewarded for completing a dungeon or killing a lot of monsters -- levels are only gained during the dungeon and all of the work that you go through while killing them seems pointless after you enter a new one and are back to ground zero.   Graphics     The game is successful in at one least one venture, establishing a fresh art style that isn't neon anime super-deformation or plastic-like CG. The Last Hope's clay graphics are both likable and memorable, and the comical opening FMV is actually the game's brightest point. Dragon Warrior fans may also enjoy the numerous homages to the rest of the series -- though Dragon Warrior Monsters offers a substantially more rewarding game with its tribute.   Sound      Torneko: The Last Hope does much to streamline dungeon exploration. An auto-map superimposed over the game screen keeps track of the level layout, treasure spots, and monster positions, while a helpful run button allows Torneko to race through completed areas at near-instaneous speeds. The catchy and upbeat, albeit somewhat repetitive, score sends an adventuring mood. These features alleviate much of the ~dead time~ found in other dungeon RPGs; most of the time you spend adventuring is in exploring new areas, not retracing your steps through old ones. My colleague David Smith probably puts it best when he describes Torneko as Claymation Nethack -- something that's only good for people with no lives, no friends, no jobs and a lot of spare time on their hands. However, even if I was in that situation, I would still be able to find much better games that I'd rather be playing to kill my time, such as Enix's own Valkirie Profile, or titles like Final Fantasy IX, Chrono Cross, Vagrant Story, Lunar 2, Shen Mue, Skies of Arcadia, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy VII, Xenogears and so on. Torneko: The Last Hope can be somewhat fun and addictive at times, but is typically just boring and repetitive.", "date": "Dec 13, 2000"}
