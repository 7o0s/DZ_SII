Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/22/smash-it-review", "text": "How many more ways can game makers find to match up similarly colored blocks without putting gamers to sleep?  The rock stars at Gameloft have come up with a novel spin by licensing the hit song ~Banquet~ from the English indie band Bloc Party.   Get it... Bloc?  Blocks?  Watch for forthcoming indie music/video game crossovers such as an equestrian racing game backed by Band of Horses, a platform jumper featuring Fall Out Boy, and other novelty acts.  Before you music snobs shriek ~Sell out!,~ keep in mind that the song playing behind Smash It! is a purely instrumental cover of ~Banquet,~ somewhat in the vein of the Genesis version of Ray Parker, Jr.'s ~Ghostbusters~ theme.   I'm not a Bloc Party fanatic, but I find their music enjoyable enough, if a tad generic.  Which makes it something of an ideal fit for Smash It!, a puzzler that provides enough variety to stay mostly interesting even as it fails to revolutionize its tried-and-true genre.   In the game's notion of the future, rock stars have been replaced by block stars -- imagine Tetris crossed with American Idol, ~performed~ before millions of screaming fans in giant stadiums.  That's the backstory, anyway, and it's worth wondering to me why game designers bother to come up with a story for a standard puzzle game.   The gameplay is typical.  Press the 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys or the D-pad to move the cursor.  Push the 5 key or press your D-pad (here referred to as ~The OK Key~) to destroy blocks.  As you demolish various combinations of colored blocks, your lightning-shaped power bar will increase; once it's full, hit the asterisk key to activate your ~rock power~ and unleash a ~super chain reaction~ that will obliterate about half the blocks in the screen -- usually just in the nick of time.   The makers of Smash It! spice up the gameplay with sudden objectives thrown at you from audience members, gifts from fans, and ten different game modes that include Blockstar, the most basic block-zapping version; Block and Roll, in which the blocks rock from side to side; and Mad Blocks, with its twitch-inducing shifts in gravity.   If the titles of those modes give you the feeling you're trapped in a Jack Black comedy about the transcendent power of rock, rest assured you aren't alone.  It's really a pity that Smash It! is content to hover on the rim of self-parody without actually leaping into over-the-top spoof.   Yes, you get to tour the world, aiming to become the greatest block star of all time.  One can't help but get the feeling, however, that all these special features are intended to cover up a game that, at its core, is remarkably generic.  Zapping colored blocks can be fun -- and certainly this game will seem astonishing to anyone who's never played the endless Tetris or Bejeweled variations -- but those who have had their fill of such games will find little to inspire them in Smash It!  If you've already exhausted the replay values of Tetris or Bejeweled, Smash It! may be just the block-puzzler you've been looking for.  And if you're a Bloc Party fan, you might thrill to their tunes. If you're neither of these, you may want to skip it rather than Smash It.", "date": "Jun 22, 2007"}
