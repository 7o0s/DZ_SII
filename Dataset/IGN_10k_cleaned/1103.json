{"name": "Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle 4", "name_review": "Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle 4", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/13/bugs-bunnys-crazy-castle-4", "text": "is one of those staple Game Boy games -- the original puzzle/platform hybrid game was released way back in the early black-and-white days more than a half-decade ago. Either the game was super popular, or it's just a matter of lack of imagination -- the game spanned a sequel in black and white, and then another when the Game Boy Color hit the market more than a year and a half ago. Number Four comes in the form of this Game Boy Color exclusive, and the game is a slight evolution from the previous game, just like the ones before it were slight alterations of the original.  Features More than sixty levels Password save Multiple offensive and defensive weapons Only for Game Boy Color  I tell you, if this Castle is so Crazy, why does Bugs keep getting suckered into going there? In his fourth trip to the wacky stronghold, Bugs believes that C. Castle is really Carrot Castle, so he wanders off to get the huge vegetable booty for himself. I never figured the rabbit had stuffing for brains...he always seemed a little brighter in the cartoons.  So he's off for a huge lunch. His adventure takes him across more than ten different locations, spread out over individual levels where he'll have to collect all the keys in the area before he can continue. Problem is, Bugs is limited to what he can do. He can't run or jump, so you're going to have to put his walking and climbing abilities to use. What's worse, all the Looney Tunes characters are out to put an end to Bugs' adventure -- while we can understand why Elmer and Wile E. might want to fricassee the rabbit, what gripes do Pepe Le Pew and Foghorn Leghorn have against the bunny? Is there an ulterior motive we're not seeing here?  The game isn't really a platform game because Bugs can't do anything but walk platforms and climb ladders. But on the flipside, it's not really a puzzle game because there's nothing tricky to solve. The levels are laid out in such a fashion that you have to figure how to access doors on higher and lower levels. Most doors hide keys, but every once in a while you'll find weapons to put the second string WB characters out of commission. If you get hit, you lose a heart. Lose three hearts, Bugs bites it and has to start the level over again -- and this could get quite frustrating in the later levels that last more than ten minutes.  The challenge is more trying to avoid getting touched by the enemy Looney Tunes. Each of the characters have their own wandering patterns, and you'll have to learn them to avoid these guys. For example, Pepe Le Pew just wanders slowly back and forth, but Daffy actually homes in on your character wherever he goes.  The weird thing is, you'll find multiple copies of the same character in each level, so finding three Daffys in a row is definitely commonplace...but still odd. Pushing rocks or mushrooms on their heads will put them out of the round, as will using your pop gun or balloons that you can collect somewhere in each level. You can also find hammers or pick axes that'll let you get through obstacles that block the path, but you can't use these things as weapons. Ah well.  Compare this game to the last in the series, and you won't find much different at all. There's a new overhead map, and all the level graphics and layouts have been changed to create a new game. But if you've snagged Crazy Castle 3 there's not much different in the way of graphics and gameplay. In fact, the character sprites are nearly identical to the last version -- the weird, super-deformed style versus the more realistic style used in Looney Tunes Collector: Alert by Infogrames.  But even though it's the same game, Crazy Castle 4 is still a somewhat decent and challenging adventure, with levels that'll last you a long time to complete. The frustration factor is high, especially when you're on the run with one life left trying to avoid the characters after you. One screw up and you have to recollect all the keys prior to being hit. It's hard to say if this game is action or puzzle, but it's just enough of both to classify it both ways. The only real disappointment is that nothing really new has been added to the gameplay...rising expectations dictate that a sequel should at least offer something fresh to the idea. Even though the game is a good game to have, Crazy Castle honestly doesn't, and never did, need the Looney Tunes license. In fact, it really doesn't add much to the game considering all the characters are deformed from their familiar style. But, hey, consumers are fickle and they'd much rather play a generic game with characters they recognize...right? If you own the last one and loved it, grab this one. If you owned the last one and want something different, well...Crazy Castle 4 isn't going to do it for you. And if you've never heard of Crazy Castle to begin with? Pick it up...it's pretty sweet.", "date": "Jul 13, 2000"}
