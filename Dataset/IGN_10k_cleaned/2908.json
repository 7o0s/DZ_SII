Zeon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/10/mobile-suit-gundam-federation-vs-zeon", "text": "This is a curious piece of work here, an apparently good Gundam game.  If you don't normally follow the import scene, perhaps you don't notice the contradiction in terms there -- since time out of mind, Japan's most popular piece of giant robot animation has been nearly synonymous with videogame adaptations that run from the mediocre to the godawful, thanks to Bandai's traditional policy of letting the license pull in the customers.  I've said a few nice things about Gundam games in the past, but most of them topped out at ~If you're a fan, maybe...~  Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation Vs. Zeon, the slightly truncated title of something that was awfully long and complicated over in Japan, makes it past that line to become an actually decent fighting game.  In large part, that's likely because Bandai didn't make it -- Federation Vs. Zeon was originally produced for the arcade by some Byzantine alliance, whereby Sega supplied the hardware, Bandai supplied the license and some of the artwork, and a team at Capcom did most of the important stuff.  The result is something roughly akin to Virtual-On -- while it's not as fast or tightly designed as Hitmaker's ace mecha combat games, it's a decent enough fighter that makes great use of the license.  Perhaps I'm taking too rosy a view here on account of this game has Gogg in it, 'cuz boy, do I loves me some Gogg.  But I suspect even those who aren't familiar with the series will get a kick out of this one.  Gameplay Federation Vs. Zeon has two distinct types of stages, which in turn correspond to different divisions in the mecha lineup and variations in the control scheme.  Ground stages are mostly bound to earth, although nearly all the mecha in the game can fly a bit, while space stages involve 360-degree movement.  Targeting, weapons systems, and basic control all change when the stage shifts from ground to orbit and back.  The control scheme is intuitive enough, however, especially if you've played something like Virtual-On before.  At a very basic level, this is V-On with multiple targets, and far fewer boundaries to each stage.  A lock-on system provides guidance for weapons, with movement and range affecting accuracy, and each mobile suit has a selection of ranged and hand-to-hand weapons appropriate to their presentation in the animated series.  Too bad nobody bothered to make a Twinstick peripheral, because that would have made this even more fun to control.  It would have been nice if this had a pace closer to Virtual-On's frenetic speed, though.  The larger stages and slower combatants, even when powered by their speed-boost verniers, leave a bit more dead space in between encounters.  It often takes time to move from target to target, especially in the wider space stages, which slows things down a little in comparison to the way combat is presented in the anime.  Hand-to-hand duels pick things up a bit, thanks to some neat cinematic camera angles, but it often takes forever to get in range.  Another issue that die-hard fighting fans may have with the game is the huge disparity in capabilities between different mobile suits.  While most fighting games strive for parity between different combatants, Federation Vs. Zeon throws that idea out the window -- some suits in the game are simply all-around better than others (and the Ball appears to have been included as some kind of inside joke).  Variations in terrain can make up for that, however, at least to a degree.  Amphibious suits like Gogg and Z'gok may be clumsy on land, for example, but they gain a distinct advantage in underwater levels.  There's also the personality factor to take into account.  Yes, Gogg may not be as effective as a Gouf or Dom or even a Z'gok, but dangit, he's Gogg.  The disparity between mecha abilities mainly shows up in the versus mode, though.  The single-player game is a little more fairly balanced, and between the Arcade and Campaign modes, there's a lot of meat to the solo missions.  Arcade mode simply presents a series of encounters in different settings, roughly approximating the progression of the original series.  Campaign mode includes a freer mission progression structure and a touch of logistical planning, where you have to manage a cadre of mobile suits and use its resources effectively from mission to mission.  The Campaign mode starts out with some pretty dull, cakewalk-type missions, but later on there's more to do than just tool around on training missions with a Zaku-I.  Graphics Capcom's 3D engine isn't up there with the best, but it's strong enough to do justice to the classic mecha designs and settings.  It's those settings in particular that make the game's visual presentation, with levels from all over the original TV series.  While the modeling may be comparatively simple, with a fair amount of repeating textures and aliasing in evidence, the game looks good enough to convey a nifty feeling of being there, as it were.  This is one of those qualities that will, as usual, appeal more to fans than anyone else, but it's there for those who can appreciate it.  The space missions offer a more general appeal.  While land-based action is a little drab, even given the odd bit of destructible environmental architecture, the levels up in orbit are awfully cool sometimes.  Flying between the solar panels of a wrecked space colony, or smashing through a fleet of Federation space cruisers, has the kind of ineffable appeal you get from a good flight sim.  The mobile suit animation plays a significant role there, I think, since the game has no problem with letting you fly upside down, flip end-for-end, or otherwise go through ridiculous zero-G contortions at the whim of the automatic lock-on.  Again, the simple-but-effective qualification applies to the mobile suit models.  They could be better, but they're still an improvment on just about any other Gundam game on the market, and the breadth of the mecha selection is superb.  The Zeon selection has everything from a Zaku-I up through oddballs like Acguy and Zock, while the Federation hangar lets you fiddle around with a Guntank in between more straightforward sorties in the RX-78.  It's clear that Zeon fans are getting a better deal, but then it's always been that way, hasn't it?  Sound I'm writing this review at home, an apartment I share with a couple of other people.  One of them was reading a book when I put the game in to check up on a few things.  ~I'm sorry,~ I said, ~this will only take a few minutes.  I hope the godawful voices don't bother you too much.~  ~Nah, that's okay,~ he replied.  ~But yeah, these voices are godawful.~  In part, that may be down to the '70s-vintage dialogue the characters are forced to repeat, the kind of lines that even make you cringe as subtitles.  Either way, though, the game probably would have hurt less in this respect if it had been left in Japanese, a choice which would have also saved a little time and effort on the part of the American production team.  The rest of the audio, though, consists of music and sounds sampled from the classic TV series, which should be a lot of fun for its followers.  The music may seem a little dated to modern ears (well, make that a lot dated -- it has been more than 20 years), but hey, it's Gundam.  If you crave new-school noise, go watch that nasty-looking SEED show they're getting ready to inflict on us.The fan-colored sunglasses caveat may apply here, as I mentioned before.  If you're a follower of the Gundam anime, that's not any kind of problem, but if you're looking for quality mecha action, it may be.  I still maintain, however, that this is the best game to appear in the canon yet, both for single-player and split-screen action.  The arcade-style controls and breadth of available mobile suits offer a lot of fun for fans and non-fans alike.And anyway, whatever you think, I still love my Gogg.", "date": "Sep 10, 2002"}
