The racing phenomenon, with awesome origins in moonshine running, gets bigger every year as audiences tune in for high-speed thrills and some pretty over-the-top personalities. The only downside of NASCAR -- except for the whole fossil fuels thing -- is the time commitment. It takes well over three hours to watch a full NASCAR race, but EA Mobile and developer Floodgate Entertainment have distilled the essentials into an easily digest five-minute experience.   NASCAR 07 is another dual-edition game. Higher-end handsets can play a 3D racer while mid- to low-range phones get the smoothest top-down driving game I've seen since I-play's Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift. This review is for the 3D edition, as I feel there is a significant enough difference between the versions that demands two scores.   EA Mobile makes extensive use of the NASCAR license. All of the drivers are recognizable names, such as Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon. Each car sprite is a faithful recreation of the real deal, all the way down to the paint job. NASCAR 07alsoemploys the biggest tracks in the circuit, like Daytona International and the Talledega Superspeedway. NASCAR fans are bound to be pleased with the use of the license.   When you begin, you can either jump right into a quick race, burning a few laps to get the hang of the controls, or head into The Chase, where you pick a racer and steer for the Cup Championship, amassing points with each victory. I highly recommend you try out an inconsequential quick race just to see how things work, such as drafting and pitting.   The field of vision takes up the majority of the screen, but meters, a track map, and race information flank your view of the field. The track map shows exactly where you are in the race every second of the way. The race ticker shows your standing, calls out actions of other drivers, and other necessary alerts. To the right, you have you fuel meter and a diagram of your four tires. Keep a watchful eye on these two callouts as they'll let you know when you need to pit. Ignoring them will only lead to disaster, especially if you do something so embarrassing as run out of fuel on the last lap.   One of my favorite things about NASCAR 07 is the ability to select your driver's aggressiveness on the track by pressing up or down. Instead of worrying about acceleration or braking, you instruct your driver to either drive as hard as possible or take it easy. Aggressive racing may help you advance in the field, but your car pays the price. Tearing around corners is hell on tires. The aggressiveness selector and manual pit control add real strategy to NASCAR 07. It's too easy to discount NASCAR as a bunch of left turns; these drivers have to make constant choices for over three hours -- and do it at 200mph.   Steering is handled by pushing left and right on the directional pad. Tap for the shallow turns to keep a smooth race line (the game lets you know when you've hit the turn just right). Turning too hard cause your back wheels to swing wide, inviting serious disaster in a crowded field.    To advance up the field, you must use drafting. When you successfully fall in behind another car and draft, little ~whoosh~ lines appear alongside your car. After drafting for a second or two, steer into an open lane to rocket ahead of the car in front of you. This is an overly simplified way to advance, but it makes the race quite accessible.   When it's finally time to pit, press *. At the next opportunity, your car will automatically pull into the pits. You can choose from a handful of maintenance options, such as ~fuel only~ or ~two tires.~ Gauge how long you'll be in the pits so you aren't too heavily punished. It's best to pit when the race in under a yellow flag.   Up to this point, the 2D and 3D games are very similar. Here's where the pack gets a little muddy:   The 3D NASCAR 07 is fully polygonal and what it attempts -- rendering a field of 20 stock cars roaring around a track -- is quite ambitious. But whereas the 2D version was incredibly smooth to watch and play, the 3D feels jerky. I tested it on an LG 8300 and while the camera, positioned above and behind your car, offers a great vantage point of the action, the sluggish frame rate really steals any solid sense of speed. The game never devolves into a slide show, but when the screen was full of cars, things definitely became choppy. And when you're trying to drafting through a heavy pack, using the sling shot move to rocket to the front, that kind of chop just spoils things.   The two games control pretty much the same, too, but lane changes in the 2D game were also smoother. You could inch out to get a clean shot up the pack. In the 3D game, pressing to the left or right jerks your car hard. It's as if there are twelve pre-determined lanes on the tack and you click into each one of them.  My personal pick between the two versions is the 2D edition of NASCAR 07. The smooth racing trumps the 3D graphics no mater how you look at it. I think a NASCAR enthusiast will enjoy either game, as this is a good rendition of the sport (complete with a great use of the license), but if for any reason you have a choice between the two, go with the 2D game. It's not an ugly duckling by a long shot -- the hand-drawn sprites and cars are quite good. Hopefully, NASCAR 08 will combine the look of the 3Dedition with the better frame rate and control of the 2D game.", "date": "Feb 27, 2007"}
