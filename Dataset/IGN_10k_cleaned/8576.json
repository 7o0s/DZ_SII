One of the best, if not THE best is Kirby's Pinball Land. Released shortly after Kirby's debut in Kirby's Dream Land, the game borrows a lot from its predecessor. Kirby fans will immediately recognize all the supporting characters and settings. But in Pinball Land, rather than avoiding (or swallowing) his enemies, Kirby is bumping into as many of them as he can. FeaturesBattery-backed cart saves high scores Interrupt save feature Classic pinball action with unconventional quirks Difficulty level: MediumThe GamePinball Land features three separate tables (or lands) for Kirby to tackle in his quest to reach King Dedede. These tables are modeled around levels from Dream Land and feature the same music, enemies, and bosses. Players choose their table in the Warp Screen by firing Kirby from a cannon towards a table. Play will then be limited to that table until either that land's boss is defeated or Kirby activates a special Warp Star that will take him back to the Warp Screen. Each table is made up of three vertical screens, each with its own bonuses and mini-goals. In addition, players can warp to a bonus stage unique to each table, as well as to the ubiquitous boss stage. The manual offers a nice breakdown of all the features and tricks of each table. The controls for the game will be recognizable to anyone who has played a pinball game on Game Boy before. The control pad is used for the left flipper and to bump the table. The 'A' button controls the right flipper. There isn't really a plunger, as Kirby floats in on a star (typical). But when Kirby goes down the drain, the game isn't necessarily over. Kirby falls onto a springboard, which can catapult him back into play if you hit 'A' at just the right time. Don't depend on this though, as the springboard becomes less effective with each use (to bounce Kirby back more than two times is a feat indeed). Still, I've had more high scores salvaged by this feature than I care to admit. Kirby's Pinball Land is battery backed, so high scores will be saved (of which I am made painfully aware each time I turn it on and find my brother's name in every slot). Moreover, the game boasts an interrupt save feature. Simply pause play, select save, and shut down. Next time you turn on the unit you may resume your game with the ball right where you left it (you'll have about three seconds to get your bearings before the ball begins moving again). Try THAT with a Bally table!  Though this is not Kirby's most stunning outing visually, there is plenty of eye candy here. The novelty of most of the visuals really sells the game. One of my favorites is a bumper that features Kirby ~thinking~ about various items he has consumed. Hit him with the ball and he spits out the item shown in his thought bubble. The items can then be claimed for warps and points. I also love the top screen of the Kracko Land table, which features celestial bodies that must be bumped out to warp to the Kracko boss.  Music is fun and backs the play nicely. Incidentally, all of the music and sounds are lifted directly from Kirby's Dream Land so if the sound drove you crazy in that one then you will likely be exercising your volume knob. One of the weaker points of the game, but serviceable nonetheless. Gameplay value: Unlike Kirby's Dream Land, which ended all too quickly, Pinball Land is all about replay value. With the dual goals of reclaiming the high score while defeating King Dedede, the game will draw you back again and again. And I simply can't say enough about the interrupt save feature. It's so nice to be able to put the game down in the middle of those marathon bouts without having to give up the pursuit of a high score. No more skipping dinner. This is what pinball should be. The ball movement is smooth and true. Gameplay is consistently involving and just plain fun. We are fortunate to enjoy several great pinball titles on the Game Boy, with more on the way. But if you haven't played pinball Kirby style, have you really played pinball? Steve Averett reviews games for IGNpocket's #1 affiliate, GBCDojo.
