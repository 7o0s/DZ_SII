One of the more recent releases on Valve's Steam download service, the game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.   To add flavor, everyone else on each map has a quarry as well. While pursuing your own target, you'll need to stay alert and attempt to spot the passenger readying a knife for your back. The six maps included in the download don't allow the player to run around brandishing a weapon.  While strolling around in haughty speakeasy-era garb searching for your quarry, you'll need to avoid security. Guards stand around on each map, and somehow the brilliant ship engineers even managed to fit electronic security cameras in there as well. Should you get caught with a knife or poison syringe in your hand, you're slapped with a fine and a penalty period in jail.   Might want to mix in some water, buddy. Though getting jailed empties your inventory and briefly removes you from the action, the fine is more of the problem. The Ship is an entirely multiplayer game, which can be played online against others or offline against bots. Successfully stabbing or bludgeoning your quarry without getting caught drops a big chunk of change into your wallet. Since winning a round requires you to have to highest cash purse, it's in your best interest to avoid getting arrested.   There are plenty of lethal tools on each map, including a blunderbuss, walking stick, poison syringe, truncheon, candlestick, umbrella, croquet mallet, knitting needle, letter knife, wrench, fire axe, pool cue, wallet bombs, and on and on. They're scattered all over the place, though you'll learn they're locations quickly enough with enough play time. Some weapons, like the poison syringe and wallet bomb, have unique effects. Getting poisoned means you'll need to head to the ship medical center for treatment. Reaching for a wallet on the ground, which drops from killed opponents, may be more lethal than you expected. Other than a few specific examples, most of the weapons are pretty basic firearms or melee weapons.   A better determinant of which weapon to pick up is the Money For Kill (MFK) list. Some guy named Mr. X, who apparently organized this whole insane mixture of high society and murder, prefers different weapons every round. By checking the list, players know which weapons yield more dollars when a successful quarry kill is pulled off. Once some money is built up, players can withdraw it from a ship bank or ATM (again, those ship engineers are amazing) to buy food, drinks, bribe security guards so they won't arrest you, and pay for a psychoanalysis session.   Hammer time...sorry that was terrible. Why buy food and drinks? To quell your Sims-like needs. As you run around, your character gets tired. As a match goes on, your character needs to use the bathroom in both senses, especially if you've been eating and drinking a lot to satisfy your hunger needs. Around each map you may find catheter and colostomy bags to take care of things on the run, but generally you'll need to find a bathroom, restaurant, coin operated vending machine (the engineers continue to impress), or bed. If you don't take care of a pressing need, bad things happen. If you don't sleep, your character eventually loses the ability to sprint. At it's maxed out point you pass out on the spot. If you avoid imbibing liquids, your character turns into pile of dust.   The character need elements make for a deeper gameplay experience, as your character is vulnerable to attack while you're downing a bag of chips or snoring on a bed. We wish there was some way to cut short the actions. If you're sleeping, for example, we couldn't find a way to break out of it until the sleep meter was wholly depleted. So if you wanted to take a quick nap and only partially satisfy your sleep needs, you're out of luck.     Four game modes are offered for gamers to eliminate their prey while keeping their bladder pleasantly voided. There's a Deathmatch, where anyone can kill anyone. Though you still have to avoid security, it's not the most interesting mode. Duel mode pits two players against each other, but the most entertaining experience is in Elimination and Hunt modes. Since nobody knows who their killer is, it makes for some intense searches for their own quarry. There's a nice map and quarry location system in the game that lets you know your quarry's last whereabouts. On your way there it's best to stick to rooms with security, so your hunter can't slap you with a candlestick.   In Elimination mode, another quarry is assigned once the first is taken out. This repeats until you're the last one remaining, at which point you win the round. In Hunt mode, the first person to take out their quarry triggers a countdown. At the end of the countdown, the round resets, so players need to act fast. From what we've played, it seems like Elimination is the most popular mode. Prospective buyers of The Ship should be warned; there'll be a lot of waiting around while playing this game. Once you've been axed out of a server, you'll have to kill time wandering around until a winner is declared. Thankfully, you can collect outfits, reading material, and weapons that will transfer to the next game during the downtime.   Realistic Roaring 20s technology. One nice feature in The Ship is the significant penalties it doles out for killing the wrong person or recklessly brandishing weaponry. The fines are steep, and if someone isn't smart about when they strike there's no way to win. Oftentimes it's the player that manages to stay out of jail and always strike the proper target that rules the server, not the one with the most kills. Getting more than three kills is a difficult feat. Even if you do manage to pull it off, someone with two could still bypass your bank account if they're using a high MFK weapon. It's a system that rewards patience and precision, which I liked.   The actual fighting, on the other hand, is far from precise. Once in a safe spot with a weapon drawn, the only real option for battle is to slam the attack button. If your approach was sneaky enough you may be able to strike once for a kill. If any actual face to face fighting breaks out, though, it's going to be an awkward affair. In Elimination matches, there's also quite a bit of downtime. Though players can reequip themselves before the next round starts, they'll also have to keep monitoring their ever-pressing needs. This makes the time in between rounds seem like more of a chore than anything else, but it's sufferable to get to the action. In addition to the online modes, there's an offline Arcade option where players battle against bots. Don't bother with it. The bots are painfully stupid, and The Ship's a game where if you're not fighting against something mildly intelligent, it really loses its appeal.   Hot. All the action is presented with some generally underwhelming graphics. There are instances of Source water here and there, but most of the ships are bland and look very similar. The characters animate stiffly, but they all have an eye-pleasing cartoonish style. Different wardrobe accessories can be added to confuse opponents as well, changing the character's outward appearance. We noticed a few graphical glitches in the game as well, like players floating around horizontally. Don't be fooled, they're still very much active participants. In terms of sound, the game's got some funny effects, like your character groaning when they've got to go to the bathroom. Other than that the sonic landscape is sparse. Radios around the ships pump in antiquated tunes, but that's only in certain areas. Basic weapon effects and a muted lapping of ocean waves round out the rest of the audio.Despite the Ship's diverse elements, they're fitted together fairly well. It's an intense experience to see someone walk by who may or may not be trying to knife your stomach. It definitely has a few faults, though. The combat is decidedly awkward, the bot A.I. is horrific, and there's a significant amount of waiting around with nothing to do. The action is interesting enough to keep players coming back, however. For those thinking of making the 20 dollar purchase, be aware that it rewards patience and commitment much more than twitch skills. It forces you to pay attention to your character's needs, lest they die or commit suicide, which some may have a distaste for. I liked it though, and found The Ship to be a refreshing diversion from the doldrums of convention.", "date": "Aug 25, 2006"}
