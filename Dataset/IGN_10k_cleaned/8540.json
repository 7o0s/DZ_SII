Pay a visit to the PlayStation Store and you'll have your proof: Rampage: World Tour is there and available for download.   At age 10, World Tour is SOE's youngest ~Midway Classics~ PSN revival... but that doesn't necessarily make it the best. Though it does have an advantage over 1998's PS One version in that you can play with three people at a time, it's a direct arcade port -- meaning that you can expect very little by way of home-friendly extras. Online play and 1080p support are definite plusses, but like Sony's previous ports, the HD resolution makes almost no difference in visual presentation and the networked play doesn't boast voice chat or communication of any kind.   Mindless fun or just  Since playing Rampage doesn't require any real strategy (just smash buildings and move on), the lack of vocal contact when connected online may not be bothersome to everyone. The masses will probably be miffed in force, however, about the absence of a save feature. With more than 120 different stages that take place throughout the world (and even the moon), Rampage can take in upwards of four hours to beat when playing nonstop. It's a ridiculous notion in this day and age to expect players to be okay with the idea that no matter how close to the end they may be, they'll have to start to all over again should they choose to take a break from the mayhem.    To its credit, Rampage: World Tour can be fun in limited doses. Mindless as it might be, it was a big step forward over the previous game in its day because it added a kick button to support the existing punch. It also scrolls the screen sideways so that you can travel to multiple buildings and it has increased the number of power-ups, enemies, and food types that users encounter along the way. Players can even transform into a winged purple critter that does more damage than any other monster you'll meet. Those are good things, right?   Yes they are. But even still, it won't take long before you realize that without a save state or a variation of gameplay (George, Lizzie, and Ralph are functionally the same character despite appearances), Rampage: World Tour wears thin fairly quickly. The game is really more about a war of attrition than skill (you will get hit and die regardless of what you do), so the most important button on the controller is ~continue~ and nothing else.For only five bucks, Rampage: World Tour isn't the worst experience you'll find on the PlayStation Network, but it certainly isn't the best one either. With zero skill required to play and no save function available for those who want to see it all, ~repetition~ is a word that you'll become intimately familiar with before long.", "date": "May 29, 2007"}
