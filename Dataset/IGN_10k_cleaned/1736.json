The expectations are much lower on the handheld, and its capabilities are a lot friendlier to the graphic and gameplay qualities of games of the early-to-mid Eighties. But sometimes, even the Nintendo handheld isn't enough to do some of the more unique game designs of the Golden Age...take Sgt. Rock on the Frontline as a prime example. The title is based on the classic Taito arcade title Frontline, and as close as the game looks on the handheld, there's no way the GBC's controls can accurately portray the gameplay the original arcade title offered. Features More than eight missions Three different weapons and grenades Tanks, jeeps, and gunboats Only for Game Boy Color  It's a close mimicry of the original arcade game  the game puts you in the role of a one-man army, progressing up a vertically and horizontally scrolling environment and taking out an endless swarm of soldiers. You'll be able to pick up weaponry and power-ups to make your task a little easier and in some areas, vehicles are at your command -- tanks are slow but pack a mean wallop, jeeps are speedy but don't have the firing range, and gunboats speed your soldier across water with a machinegun as a defense. In some cases, this Game Boy Color rendition fixes problems of its parent edition  the playability flows a lot smoother and there's a lot more targets and variety to the end-of-stage challenges. BAM Entertainment just attached the Sgt. Rock license to the game for sales reason  kids might not know the 1960s comic book hero, but the game becomes a bit more recognizable with the name than simply Frontline.  The problem is, though, the game originally required the use of a rotation knob to aim your character's weapon while moving in a totally independent direction. Frontline was the first game to introduce this little control scheme in the arcade  spawning clones like Ikari Warriors and Time Soldiers that built off its knob idea.  The controls have been greatly reduced in the Game Boy Color edition because of the lack of a control dial. The game plays nicely, sure, but you'll run into problems such as trying to get away from a soldier and trying to shoot him at the same time. In the arcade, all that was required was a turn of the knob, but in this version you have to quickly change direction and fire, putting your guy in serious danger as you'll be walking toward the threat for a brief second. Without the spinning interface, the game loses its original appeal and becomes a less-than-original clone of Capcom's classic Commando.  The game's also a little on the easy side  it has unlimited continues, and when you learn the slightly different AI patterns for each of the three colored soldiers in the game, it's all a matter of memorizing the level placements. White soldiers will never follow you, as they'll march in a straight line until they're off-screen. Black/purple soldiers will try to get as close to you as possible, but they can be easily taken out with a lob of a grenade. And brown soldiers never move  they just sit there and throw pineapples in your general direction. On the plus side, the continue takes you right back to the very beginning of the current level, so you'll have to learn to conserve your limited lives in reserve.  Sgt. Rock on the Frontline is an old-school action game that's not much more than its original design  the developers worked more level design into the mix, but each mission has the same requirements as the last. It's a short game, too  it's possible to finish the game in a sitting, as long as you don't turn the power off. It's good to see the classics return, but in this case the Frontline feel is completely lost because of control limitations. It's a fun game, just not a great one.", "date": "Jan 25, 2001"}
