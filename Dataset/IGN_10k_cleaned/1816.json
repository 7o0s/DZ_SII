Frightens me, even, sometimes.  Think about it.  These games are built around a world of unceasing warfare, a constant global struggle between the forces of Us and Them.  We are always right, and They are always the Enemy, to be destroyed on sight regardless of the circumstances.  There is no reason for the conflict -- it's Orwell's 1984 come back to life.  ~We are at war with the Tan.  We have always been at war with the Tan.~  But what differentiates Us from Them?  Only color, and here we come to the crux of the matter.  What is the message contained within Army Men, and what is it teaching to the young audience it's being marketed towards?  If someone is a different color from you, you should shoot them?  Maybe I'm overreacting a little, but I'm wondering about what it will be like to live in a world full of children who've grown up on Army Men, and I don't like what my mind's eye sees.  Oh, well.  Even if Army Men isn't a racist parable designed to warp the minds of America's youth and turn our country into a hellish cauldron of violent bigotry, it's still a bunch of not-fun games.  Army Men: World War - Final Front may be superior to its predecessors in the World War series, of which I have minimal experience, but the improvement is not substantial enough to make me want to play this any more than is absolutely necessary.  You should probably not play it at all.  Gameplay  The World War subseries is distinguished from Sarge's Heroes and the original Army Men 3D by the addition of more vehicular combat to supplement the basic running around and shooting things.  This is a solid premise, and if executed well it could provide quite a good time.  However, World War does not execute it well, and it does not provide a good time.  The problems begin when you're on foot.  You turn slowly, you run slowly, and there is no strafe control, so to speak, only a ridiculously slow sidestep maneuver whose purpose escapes me.  This makes circle-strafing impossible, which is a vital maneuver in this type of game.  Thus, your principal tactic for taking out opponents is to charge them head-on, since the vagaries of the auto-aim mean you have to look your enemies square in the eye.  This tactic, of course, runs contrary to the principle of self-preservation that ought to be overriding, and thus you find yourself in a bit of a quandary.  Essentially, what you have to do is play through a stage repeatedly, memorize the points from which the enemies spawn, and learn to whack them before they take up their positions.  I disapprove of this sort of game design, since it requires me to die over and over in futile effort after futile effort -- it may be just me, but I expect that others may find it similarly unsatisfying.  It's as if the level designers skipped straight ahead to advanced mission design and forgot the basics, because there are actually some cool collections of objectives here, especially when special weapons like the grenades and mortars get involved.  You just have to die like a fly repeatedly in order to complete them.  Once you hop in one of the game's many vehicles, you encounter a more mixed bag of control issues.  Some of the vehicles control pretty well (the training mode is helpful at this juncture), and others offer you such powerful defensive capabilities that it doesn't really matter whether you can drive them straight or not.  Whether you enjoy them or not, though, the fun generally ends once you leave your temporary ride.  Graphics  It's green, it's tan, the textures are blocky and the engine is shaky.  Yep, I'm playing an Army Men game, alright.  World War particularly fails in the area of character modeling and animation -- the tiny, emaciated characters move about as smoothly as their plastic dime-store inspiration.  The backgrounds around them are clothed in low-res textures of minimal artistic inspiration, and the 3D models wobble like they were made out of Jell-O.  Some of the explosions are nice, and the smoke effects accompanying them as well, but they're like expensive curtains hung around a window somebody just threw a rock through.  The failings of the core 3D engine (poor collision detection, gaping seams between polygons, the middling to low framerate) are too great to overcome without a ground-up effort to rework the game.  Sound  As the mighty Sam Bishop has observed in his classic Army Men reviews, these games actually sound kind of fun.  The rum-dummy-dum B-grade war-movie themes are entertaining in their rather cheesy way, and the sound effects follow suit.  All the guns sound different, from the crackle of machineguns to the whump-boom of mortars, and the evil Tan fiends scream satisfyingly when they die.  It occurs to me, however, that I could acquire the same enjoyment from popping in my laserdisc of Patton for a couple of hours, on top of which I could be enjoying a couple of legendary performances from George C. Scott and Karl Malden, instead of just dying over and over. If you have played an Army Men game, then you know.  If you have not played an Army Men game, then you are lucky.  Final Front does not change very much at all, it merely writes the series' legacy of shame in slightly bolder letters.In 1972, Hunter Thompson asked when it would all end.  I would like to know that as well.  He was talking about presidential politics, admittedly, rather than videogames, but I believe the answer has as much or more personal significance to me, because I think it would actually be easier to live through four more years of Nixon than four more years of two Army Men games each quarter.There is a game coming out a little while after Army Men: World War - Final Front.  It is called Metal Slug X.  Like AMWWFF, it features running and shooting and a dash of vehicular combat.  Unlike AMWWFF, it features absolutely no deficiencies of control whatsoever, and it is one of the most beautiful feats of game artwork I have ever seen.  Please play it instead.", "date": "Mar 6, 2001"}
