You basically have your choice of either an old man or a monkey. The old man might serve you better, but the monkey will provide for better stories at social gatherings. But if you had 400 monkeys, oh, the stories you'd have... and thrown feces I suppose, but that's what the main butler monkey is for.   In Ape Escape 3, Mr. Specter has teamed up with the afro-wearing Dr. Tomoki to once again unleash a horde of monkeys upon the world, this time setting them out to create a countless amount of mundane television shows. With the theory that once all of mankind is glued to their television sets, the world will be an easier place to take over. No, the story isn't very realistic as shows can't get much worse than the crap we humans produce ourselves and run on the WB, but whatever.    Along with the overarching storyline, the television shows bring a lot of the humor to the game, something that the series has always been knee-deep in. Each of the levels is essentially a studio for one of the shows, ranging from a desert set where a mockery of Indiana Jones is being filmed to a spooky house and cemetery where the Monday the 16th crew has set up shop. Should you happen to sneak upon a certain camera in each of the sets, you're even able to capture a small piece of the show that you can watch later. As far as setting, story and setup go, the game does a great, if entirely non-sensical, job of pulling you into the absurd world of Ape Escape 3.   The basic gameplay mechanics of Ape Escape 3 haven't changed much at all since the release of the first game on the PlayStation. It still utilizes a dual-analog stick design where the right stick controls all of your actions, be it swinging your Stun Club or firing the Slingback Shooter. The setup still works as well as ever, though with the camera buttons assigned to the D-Pad and out of the way a bit, combined with the chaotic nature of escaping monkeys, there are still camera problems every now and then. It's generally not a major problem and something you can work around, though it can sometimes be hard to aim the camera exactly where you want it while you move in another direction, like during boss battles.   Like the past games in the series, the game's controls are spot-on. Player control is extremely tight and it's a joy to run either Kei or Yumi (the two selectable characters) through the monkeys' various television studio sets. With small attentions to detail, like how your character will grab a hold of a ledge should you walk off the edge of a platform, there's a feeling of refinement in the controls that many lesser games lack.   The main new gameplay elements that Ape Escape 3 adds to the series come in the form of morph modes. By way of some curious device on your wrist, you're able to morph into one of eight different forms, which you'll gather over the course of the game. Each one has special abilities unique to it, allowing you advantages during certain battles or even the necessary skills in order to pass to unreachable areas. For example, the Dragon Kung Fu Fighter form will allow you to punch buttons that you can't otherwise trigger, while the Fantasy Knight will allow you to repel streams of fire with its shield.   Some forms wind up being more useful in the long run than others. Though the Fantasy Knight is more powerful than other forms, it's really only useful in the couple of instances where you need to repel fire, such as the Genie Dancer is only good for when you need to open ~musical~ doors or pass through genie portals. On the other hand, the Miracle Ninja form is awesome in that it not only gives you more power than your base form, but it's faster and easier to capture monkeys with as well. On the whole, most of the forms offer at least a couple reasons to switch into them, and half of them are legitimately useful throughout the entirety of the game. Not only that, but they're all individualized enough that no two feel like cheap knockoffs of another form, helping to mix up the feel of the game each time you switch into a new form.     While the beginning of the game largely ignores its platforming roots, focusing more on the hunt and capture of an assortment of monkeys, the later levels in the game really make you test your old-school skills and reflexes. Jumping between large, moving gears, hopping between moving platforms, and needing to make large jumps in order to reach new areas are all part of the last few stages. The last two areas are actually focused more around flat-out platforming than rounding up monkeys. There are still monkeys about, to be sure, but progressing through the stages becomes your goal rather than rounding up a certain number of simians. It's a nice change of pace and matches the storyline well as the end of the game focuses solely on capturing Dr. Tomoki and Mr. Specter, though there are still a whole slew of monkeys for your capturing pleasure.    One other cool way the game changes up its play mechanics is with the various vehicles it throws your way time and again. Each of them uses the dual-analog sticks in excellent fashion; the rowboat requires you to ~row~ the sticks in opposite directions for example, while the tank controls are extremely similar to the Katamari Damacy controls. There are a couple slightly awkward mechanisms, like having to click down on the analog sticks to cause a robot to punch, but as a whole the vehicles work very well and do a great job of using the Dual Shock 2 to its fullest potential.   One of the best parts of every Ape Escape game to date has been the exasperating amount of unlockable content within, and Ape Escape 3 trumps them all. There's so much extra content and things to do when you're done that beating the game only earns you roughly 50% game completion. With 400 monkeys to catch and numerous items to buy, mini-games to beat and more, it'll take you a while before you finish this one off.   The extra content ranges from the standard Monkeypedia to the fantastic Mesal Gear Solid, a monkey-fied take on Metal Gear Solid that Konami actually contributed to the game. Featuring something on the order of eight playable levels and many of the tricks you'd expect to find in an MGS title, Mesal Gear Solid puts the ~game~ in mini-game.   If that wasn't enough, you'll find a few other enjoyable mini-games to play, like Super Monkey Throw Stadium!, a hammer throw-type game where one monkey tosses another down a football field, Olympic-style. Extra RC cars to choose from, various tracks to play through, photo cards, TV channel guides and more are here to collect. It's a very large amount of extra content to go through, and though you might not be interested in some of them, there are plenty of other items there that'll keep your collectable interest, like the minigames.Ape Escape 3 is a fun game, simple as that. The game has a great sense of style that, though childish, can appeal to anyone. The sheer amount of parodies and flat-out absurdity make for a nice amount of humor throughout the game, and its action/platforming mix is wholly enjoyable. If you've been a fan of the series up until now, you'll likely love the new morph modes as they had a whole new dimension to the series. And if you haven't tried out any of the Ape Escape games yet, pick up Ape Escape 3 as it's one hell of a good time.", "date": "Jan 13, 2006"}
