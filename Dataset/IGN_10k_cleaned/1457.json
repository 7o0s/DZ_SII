Luckily, I expect they'll be able to see what is obviously just an attempt to cash in on the small segment of the PlayStation market dumb enough to buy anything with a wrestling promotion's logo on it, and pick up the vastly superior WWF Smackdown 2, arriving in just a couple of weeks.  If they still fall for this one, though, I feel terribly bad for them, because they may attempt to actually have a good time with their purchase.  That way lies madness - Backstage Assault looks unforgivably awful, recycles the middling control system from WCW Mayhem, and builds itself around a gimmick that defeats the purpose of a wrestling game.  It's not good, children.  Not good at all.  Gameplay  The idea behind Backstage Assault is that it's wrestling with no wrestling involved.  Well, almost, anyway.  It focuses entirely on the ~hardcore~ backstage brawls that became an institution in WCW during the Sandman's brief stay in Atlanta (and later took on a life of their own in an imitation of the WWF's Hardcore Championship), including no in-ring action at all.  Every match takes place in a network of interconnected backstage areas, where belting your opponent with blunt objects is at least as important in securing a victory as a scientific grappling attack.  Kodiak has come up with some potentially interesting gameplay elements from this basic concept, like foreign objects that work in concert with environmental elements (lighting 2x4s on fire with a handy burn barrel, for instance).  In practice, though, the game plays like the equivalent of the infamous Junkyard Invitational that makes up a large part of its intro movie.  Matches usually just boil down to a string of basic moves and international object shots.  For a change of scenery, you can travel from room to room, but that essentially just provides a new selection of things to jump off of and blunt objects to bean the other guy with.  Backstage Assault is extremely weak when it comes to mode selection, too.  There are championship and survival modes where you work your way through a series of matches and unlock various extras, but the multiplayer component is hardly there - the game doesn't even have tag-team matches.  Wrestling games are more than half a party affair, and much of the rest of their appeal comes from the recreation of the sport's atmosphere.  Backstage Assault doesn't do a credible job with either.  It's got commentary by Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan, but it's got commentary from Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan, for lord's sake.  Graphics  Backstage Assault lags well behind the competition visually.  The wrestlers are the worst part, skinny, low-polygon-count models with substandard texture art and shaky rendering.  The animation isn't very smooth, and it's dragged further down by poor collision detection (which walks hand in hand with the lousy-looking wrestlers).  The game seems to be throwing so much processor time into the interactive environments that the wrestlers, who I believe are supposed to be the stars, have suffered immensely.  The essentially failed gameplay concept means that the effort that's been put into building the environments is rather wasted, too.  There are a great many different rooms, all with many interactive objects and bits of furniture you can crash about or use as weapons, but in the end they're not enough pretty scenery to make up for the game's other failings.  Sound  In case I forgot to ram the point home earlier, Schiavone and Heenan are an assault on the ears after too much exposure.  Add that to the soundtrack, typical droning metallic rock, and you have a game that isn't much fun to listen to.  The crash and bang of barrels and pop machines is pretty funny early on, but like the rest of Backstage Assault's geek-show atmosphere, it just gets old after a while. Just say no.  Hopefully, one of these days WCW will dry up and go away and we'll never have to deal with games like this again, to say nothing of the promotion's wretched in-ring product.  WWF Smackdown 2 features an equally impressive collection of backstage areas, AND a proper ring, AND more game modes, AND wrestlers that don't look like refugees from WCW Versus the World, AND better animation, AND a solid gameplay system, AND more wrestlers, AND four-player support, AND far stronger presentation trappings all around, AND no Jeff Jarrett.  There is no competition here, kids, and so unless you ABSOLUTELY MUST have a game with Jeff Jarrett in it, don't give Backstage Assault a second look.", "date": "Nov 10, 2000"}
