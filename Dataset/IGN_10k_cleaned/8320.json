Will this be the Next Big Trend following the brain training craze? Or will the cheeky, but shallow Spring Break, nip the genre in the bud before it even gets started?   Spring Break: Cancun Goes Wild is a silly series of approximately 40 bacchanalian micro-games. Most are controlled with a single button such as deciding when to cliff dive into the surf, grab a drink as it slides across a bar, or tug-of-war with a pair of bikini babes. Each event lasts only a few seconds, giving the game a breathless pace. Keeping up with the ever-quickening tempo is the real challenge of this genre.   The ultimate goal of Spring Break is to be the king of spring break by successfully completing five micro-games in each of a series of locations, such as a yacht, bon fire, dance club, or hotel. After plowing through the first four or five micro-games, some locations challenge you to a sort of ~boss battle.~ This extended micro-game usually lacks a timer, but has a slightly more complex scheme. In one battle, you must climb a cliff, grabbing eggs to throw at the jock ahead of you.   Much like WarioWare, you are given no clear indication of how to beat a micro-game on first encounter. There is just a quick one or two-word hint before the game starts, like ~Catch!~ or ~Memorize!~ They aren't necessarily that tough to figure out, though. At the bon fire, for example, you're shown a set of three steaks on a grill. You must move the tongs to a steak when it starts to sizzle to flip it. Miss a steak and it's burned. If you miss a micro-game, you'll come back to it while trying to shore up a location before your set number of chances expires.   Spring Break is actually pretty entertaining at first blush. Gameloft knows how to execute on a theme. All of the micro-games are designed around a college break beach vacation. You'll rescue bikini-clad ladies from sharks, lay it down on the wheels of steel at a club, and smash beer cans with your forehead. Debauchery abound! But those 40 micro-games don't last very long and even on the hard setting, even the most casual player will burn through Spring Break in well under an hour.   You can replay the games individually or in either a Survival or Time Attack mode. In Survival, you earn medals for reaching set numbers of completed micro-games without fouling up. These medals and other spring break paraphernalia, such as sunglasses and beer helmets, act as achievements. But after playing each micro-game just a few times, the sun starts to set on Spring Break's longevity. Figuring out a micro-game is half the fun of this genre, so once you have all 40 down, that's pretty much that.   I do enjoy Spring Break's art style. The hosts of each location are nicely drawn characters with little back stories. The micro-game graphics are often minimalist, but they work. The fire in the background of the hula line, for example, works well. Great use of color, too.  Spring Break: Cancun Goes Wild is technically sound -- the WarioWare games are awesome entertainment, after all -- but this mobile edition is over far too soon for a full-price purchase. Bottom line: Needs more micro-games. Perhaps memory issues bear down on Spring Break, but at three seconds a pop, 40-odd micro-games just aren't enough. The extras modes help out, but the games are so easy to master that the challenge evaporates. The micro-game genre is sound for mobile, but any future entries -- and I certainly hope to see more -- need more content. But developers can certainly take a cue from Gameloft's ability to always nail down a theme.", "date": "Apr 3, 2007"}
