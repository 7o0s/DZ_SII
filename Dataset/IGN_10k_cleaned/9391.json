This is a genre of games that the Japanese gamer craves, and it's also a style of game that has found favour among many an otaku in the west. Titles like Final Fantasy, the 'Tales', 'Mana' and Dragon Quest series are all noteworthy examples; can Eternal Sonata hold a candle to these gaming heavyweights? We think so; it's not going to set new boundaries for the genre, but this game takes a few major risks with themes and battle concepts and this ultimately garner our support.The premise behind Eternal Sonata's whimsical setting are the final three hours of an unconscious Frederic Chopin's life. Chopin, renowned composer, is dying of Tuberculosis, and as he begins to lose grip on this world, he begins an adventure in the next. If that wasn't strange enough to set Eternal Sonata apart from the dirge of RPGs out there, the whole game is played out with a split narrative that tracks events going on around the unconscious Chopin while he himself travels through the imagined universe of his subconscious.This is a place of wonderous colour, inhabited by humans living in fear of contracting the 'disease' of magic casting. The central characters, outside of Chopin himself but inside of his mind, are Allegretto - a teenage lad with a Robin Hood complex, and Polka - a young girl with a critical illness that has given her magical powers. For the first chapters of the game, the pair lead largely separate adventures. It's during this section of the game that we're introduced to the complexities of the battle system, setting it apart from many other JRPGs on the marker. First of all, Eternal Sonata owes a lot to the Mana series for its mostly real-time combat. There's the necessary twist to add flavour of course - the combat is actually a hybrid of real-time and turn-based, with encounters starting out slow and metered, and becoming more frantic as your levels increase. Top-tier character design, animation and artistry. But you can't control the camera, which flat-out sucks for a game this pretty. Light and dark are critical elements of the battle system. Most battlefields are broken up by patches of light and dark - shade or direct sunlight. Standing in one or the other activates alternate attacks or spells; for example, a patch of light might allow you to heal your party, while the alternate dark attack might be a ranged magical spell. This adds a good degree of tactical play to what might easily have fallen into derivative Mana-esque combat. Enemies also change their attacks and even their physical characteristics according to where their standing, so sometimes luring an enemy into sunlight or shade ca drastically tilt the battle in your favour.There are a lot of smaller intricacies to the combat that underpin battles. As your party rises in rank from one to six, battle conditions begin to change. No longer can you rely on the timer to stop counting down while you move, for instance. At level two, you get 5 seconds in total to make all your movements and attacks. Your enemies are also limited to the same battle conditions too, which is only fair.What does all of this mean to the end user? The combat sequences, where you'll end up spending the greater portion of your time, is genuinely good fun; it's introduced at the right pace too, so long as you are willing to do a bit of a level grind at the start of the game. That's a minor negative point, in fact. You really do need to fight just about every enemy you encounter - most of whom just stand around or wander aimlessly, waiting for you to run into them. It's actually a little too easy to avoid combat, to your detriment, because bosses are pretty unforgiving. The later encounters really up the difficulty, making continuous fighting sessions necessary. As with any good RPG, there are some staples (read:  clichs) that companies just never seem to move on from - treasure chests, comical sidekicks, two lovers divided, alternate realities, elemental magic and so on. These and many more heavily 'inspired' elements crop up frequently in Eternal Sonata. Does it matter? If you're reading this review, then probably not - particularly if the Xbox 360 is your first console or you're only casually interested in RPGs. Eternal Sonata does go some way towards distancing itself by actually following some key events, characters and locations (all renamed and slightly altered) from Chopin's life. The game's developer in fact prided itself on combining genuinely educational content with a very playable game. Combat is an interesting blend of real-time and tactical turn-based play. Swinging the needle decisively back in its favour, Eternal Sonata is also one of the most beautiful games currently available on the platform. It is stunning and clever in equal measure. Very rarely have we been this immersed in what is basically an adventure filled with linear paths, your standard forests, towns and alternate universes. The camera, which is entirely automated, chooses the most cinematic angles (occasionally making us wish for right-stick manual control as an option, because there's just so much to see) - this cleverly keeps players from getting in too close to textures, meaning that developers could spend time making the game look outstanding at a distance, while freeing up processing power. Cutscenes, on the other hand, demonstrate incredible artistry - the character design is stunning and only vaguely  clichd. Combined with the rich and colourful fantasy setting rendered in the best combination of textures and cell-shading we've ever seen, Eternal Sonata is superb to watch. It's not technically perfect - there are moments of pixilation and some of the forests look a little bit staged rather than nicely organic - but the artistry cannot be denied.Also critical to the gameplay, given the game is about Chopin, is the score. Surprisingly, only a small part of the soundtrack actually adopts Chopin's work - the rest is very nicely composed strings and keys pieces that doesn't quite rise to Nobuo-levels of invention, but are very pleasant. The English voices, however, are not. They are pretty grating from the outset and, bless the developer, can be switched over to the original - and marginally better - Japanese voice acting. We applaud any developer who makes the decision to include this as an option.In a lot of ways, Eternal Sonata is a risky move from Namco Bandai. Blending history, classical music and high fantasy was an odd move that has ultimately paid off. We think that, while it rarely treads far from the genre's cues, it actually makes a foreign concept very approachable and even informative for a console and audience not otherwise exposed to this kind of game. As we know, the 360 isn't doing too crash-hot in the land of the rising sun, but with a few more releases like this on the way, Microsoft's system shows it can do traditional RPGs with the best of 'em.", "date": "Nov 1, 2007"}
