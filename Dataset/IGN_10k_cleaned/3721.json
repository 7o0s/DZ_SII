The ease-of-use mechanics made Neverwinter Nights one of the most accessible RPGs on the market, and the powerful toolset gave it enough oomph to capture a hardcore modding audience as well. Over a year after its release, Neverwinter Nights is still popular, no doubt due to the fruitful mod community. With thousands of user-created modules available for download, you could literally play the game forever. Of course, this is kind of a double-edged sword of the bastard variety for Bioware. Sure, it's fantastic to have an active mod community that supports your game with great new content, but what do you do when you want to capitalize on the success of the original by releasing an official expansion pack? Bioware and Atari are about to find out.Developed jointly by FloodGate Entertainment (comprised largely of former Looking Glass employees) and Bioware, Shadows of Undrentide is the first official expansion pack for Neverwinter Nights. As the original game is needed to play the game, if you don't know anything about Neverwinter, we suggest you read our Neverwinter Nights review before getting into this one. Shadows of Undrentide starts you out as a powerful Dwarvish mage's apprentice, searching for the culprits behind an elaborate artifact heist. There are evil wizards who deserve a good smiting, dragons to deceive and malevolent mummies residing in deep, dark crypts just begging to be annihilated. Sure, it's a bit  clich and generic, but it works. What is more problematic is the pacing of the story and the tempo of the game. You find some relatively powerful magic items pretty early in the first dungeon in the game -- at least powerful for your level -- and it's slow going from there until the end of chapter one. Shadows of Undrentide has a few dnouements where everything just seems to come together in a nice little package, and a few major events all hit at the same time. Also, with the exception of the boss fights, the game is rather easy, so you'll blow through dungeons pretty rapidly, leaving a horde of dead in your wake. I personally prefer the story and spoils of labor to be a bit more evenly paced in my RPGs. Unlike most add-ons, the expansion isn't an extension of the first game, but rather an entirely new module. Because of this, you won't be able to bring your character over from the first RPG, and you'll have to start with either one of the pre-made first-level characters or create one of your own. This is kind of disappointing if you've invested dozens of hours into your favorite character, but FloodGate and Bioware make up for it with the addition of five new ~prestige~ classes. There are a few caveats, though. These high-level classes aren't available at the start of the game. You'll have to work your way toward these classes by picking the right skills and abilities as you rise in rank, and if you make the right choices, most are available around level five. The new classes include the Assassin (you know, an Assassin...stab, poison, laugh), Arcane Archer (a spell-casting ranger that uses his magic to enhance his arrows with special properties, and also my personal favorite), Blackguard (basically a necro-warrior, anti-Paladin evil badass), Harper Scout (a stealthy rogue/ranger) and Shadowdancer (another stealthy type that's a bit more limber and evasive than the Harper Scout). The other limitation is that all of the new classes favor rangers, rogues and evil characters, with not much new offered to the pure or virtuous classes (ie. clerics and paladins). That mean those of you who typically like to stick to these types of character may miss out on the prestige classes. Like the original, you're still limited to direct control over just one character. Thankfully Undrentide does improve on this system a bit and allows you access to your companion's inventory now, so you can transfer items in and out of their packs and use them to cart booty back from the dungeon depths. For more than half the game, you're limited to partying with a rogue or sorcerer -- your fellow apprentices. Along with the prestige classes, that may be a determining factor in what character class you start with, obviously putting more importance on a class that can swing a hefty sword or axe. NPC AI is still a little wonky, and on more than one occasion I found my adventuring companion just standing around with an arrow in her head without doing anything...perhaps she was the lucky recipient of a makeshift lobotomy when those tips poked into the soft tissue. Overall though, the NPC system is well done with only a few shortcomings, and is a slight improvement over the original game. The original easy-to-use, elegant game mechanics are all there are well, and Neverwinter Nights truly has one of the best control systems of any 3D RPG out there.    You can play the game as either evil, good or neutral, lawful or chaotic, and several situations will change dramatically based on how you play. A smooth-talking Rogue may be able to wrest that precious gem out of a stupid giant without having to sink a short sword in his ankles, while a brutish fighter may be destined to just go head-first into the fray from the out start. Shadows of Undretide actually seems to allow for more choices in alignment roleplaying than the original, and there are several instances where the game changes dramatically depending on your demeanor.Neverwinter Nights still looks good after a year, and you can expect some new visuals -- especially spells and lighting effects -- in Shadows of Undrentide. This game really shows off how to do lighting correctly, and the real-time shadows still amaze me as they dance on the walls, wrap around solid objects and stretch as you get further away from a light source. The 64MB textures are crisp and clean as well, and look particularly nice fully bump-mapped. However, SoU does suffer from the same repetitive, generic look that the original did, as limited tilesets make one tomb look like the next.The first-class music and sound work is also reminiscent of NWN, and actually uses several of the same tunes and most of the sound effects from the original. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The use of positional sound is fantastic, and you can locate enemies on just sound cues alone. Voice work in Undrentide is rather sparse when compared to the overall breadth of text in the game, but the voice acting is solid, and the actors have really captured the spirit of good dramatic -- yet not extremely over-the-top -- RPG acting.Of course, one of the most unique features of Neverwinter Nights is the Aurora toolset which allows you to build your own modules. You'll find three new tilesets (a new winter/snow set, a desert setting and an ancient ruins motif. Also included to the toolset are new ~wizard~ scripts which you can use to perform commonly used actions such as creating a virtual market without having to program all of it yourself. Rounding out the brand-new additions are a few new character feats in the single-player, over 50 new spells and 16 new monster types, but it's not that different than NWN.Overall Shadows of Undrentide is a quality expansion pack, but whether or not to get it really comes down to do you really want to spend the money on a new module. It's certainly professional and well done, but so are user-created modules like Birthright of the North or the Dreamcatcher series. If you're a Neverwinter modder you'll probably want to get it just for the tilesets, creatures and new scripting wizards and NWN fans will find plenty here to keep them busy, but Shadows of Undrentide isn't a ~must-have now~ expansion pack for the average gamer.", "date": "Jun 17, 2003"}
