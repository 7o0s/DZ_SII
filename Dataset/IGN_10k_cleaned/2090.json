Gunstar Heroes, which was released on Sega's 16-bit Genesis, is arguably the best character-based shooter in existence, even surpassing the games in both the Contra and Metal Slug franchises. Radiant Silvergun, which was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan and never made it out here in the States, is easily the greatest classically-styled shooter that has ever been made.   And the list goes on: Dynamite Heady, Silhouette Mirage, Alien Solider, Sin & Punishment, Guardian Heroes, Yu Yu Hakusho and just about everything else that the company has created has been golden. In fact, they were able to take one of the most obnoxious licenses ever -- McDonalds -- and make a fantastic game out of it in the form of McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure for the Sega Genesis.    Story & Gameplay Not only have all of these games featured innovative play mechanics and near-perfect gameplay, but nearly every one has also presented some of the most eccentric character designs and story backdrops that have ever been introduced in a videogame. Yet as odd as some of the stories and characters have been, none can come close to being as peculiar as what's offered up in the company's latest, Stretch Panic for PlayStation 2.  ~This is the unusual story of an unusual little girl...~   Those are the first words you see when you start a new game of Stretch Panic, and believe me when I say that this doesn't even tell the half of it. You play the game as a cute little girl named Linda who must save her 12 egocentric sisters who have been possessed by the demons of vanity. And to do this, Linda, as you as the one who controls her, must venture into the Museum of Agony, which serves as a portal to the worlds where each demon, and the sister that it has possessed, is located.  However, unlike most videogame characters who either have super powers or an ass load of weaponry to help them on their quests, Linda only has a possessed scarf to use in her battles. But before you start thinking that having only a single ~weapon~ means that the game is limited, you're forgetting this is a Treasure game and they, more than anyone else in the world, know how to make innovative games with completely original and varied play mechanics.  You see, in this game, you use the left analog stick to move Linda around in the world and you use the right analog stick in conjunction with the R1 button to move around the scarf and grab things. And it's in the grabbing of things where this game is like nothing else out there. Everything, and I mean everything, in the world can be grabbed and stretched. And this isn't just a novelty, either, as you must use this to get you through the levels and to defeat the bosses and save Linda's 12 sisters.  For example, in getting through the mini-levels, which are populated with these creatures called Bonitas that are nothing more than small women with abnormally large breasts, you will have to stretch certain parts of environments to toss you over to other areas, as Linda can't jump (her head is much too big for her teeny little legs).   And to destroy these Bonitas and the game's 12 outrageously designed sister-possessing bosses, you must figure out how to best attack them by simply stretching at their designated stretch points or using the objects or creatures in the stage to damage them. What's more, each of the bosses require you to do something completely different and figuring out exactly what to do is half of the battle. In fact, I'd go as far to say that there's more originality and innovation in some of these bosses than most of today's new games.  As great as the boss battles are and as wonderfully fun and rewarding as they are to beat, Stretch Panic still leaves me feeling a bit empty. The game is nothing more than these 12 boss fights and going through the mini-stages to earn enough points to enter each boss stage and perform the Scarf Bomb attack to exorcise your sisters from the demons before you destroy them (read the manual before you play the game, or else you might have to do everything twice like I did). It's simply far too short to be something that's more than a rental unless you just happen to be a diehard fan of Treasure that plans to support the company to the fullest.   Graphics One of the reasons that Stretch Panic is so short is that it looks like something that was originally made to be a technology demo before it was made into a game. The visuals in the game, while completely strange and possibly unappealing to some, are quite impressive. Treasure has managed to put just about every single visual special effect that's become popular over the years into this gem, seemingly just to show the world that they can do it and that the PlayStation 2 can handle it.  Whether it be the Bump Mapping in the Gallery of Shame, the realtime reflections, anti-aliasing (no flicker or jaggies here), environmental mapping, procedural lighting that you'll see throughout the game, Stretch Panic pushes the envelope of special effects that can be done on the system (Insiders can check out some movies of these special effects in the game). It's also very brightly colored and creatively designed, so this is a visual tour de force in several different ways. The only problem is that some people might be completely turned off by the strangely designed characters that will look just too weird for those not used to Treasure's masterpieces. It's simply a matter of taste, I guess.  Sound Befitting of the game's storyline, gameplay and graphics, the sound effects and background music that's offered up here is as wacky as they come. The quirky soundtrack not only fits the general mood of the game well, but it also helps create it. Just don't expect anything that fantastic because it's more peculiar than it is good.   Likewise, most of the sound effects and noises that you'll hear throughout the game are equally as unusual -- which is the only way that it all really could be. Have I used enough derivatives of strange yet? Because of its length and the fact that there's simply not enough game here, I can't proclaim that Stretch Panic is a must-own game or that you should run to your nearest retailer and pick it up. It's definitely a game that can be completely beaten and even mastered in a weekend rental and that's what we suggest that you go out and do.[Fanboy mode: On]On the other hand, as a longtime and diehard Treasure fan, I can't help but propose that if you're also a fan of this fine company and want to help them and Conspiracy Entertainment (the publisher who will likely bring you most future Treasure games), at least consider purchasing it. You've spent so much money on crappy games based on big licenses that have helped keep useless companies in business for much too long, so why not help out a really good one.[Fanboy mode: Off]", "date": "Aug 29, 2001"}
