The shooter is like your dad; even though fashions changed years ago, he still wears that Member's Only jacket. And even though everyone always makes fun of it, he loves it and refuses to throw it out. Philosoma wears that Member's Only jacket, and matches it with a pair of Britania jeans to boot. Which isn't to say it's not a good game. It is a good game, it's just that it's starting to look a little dated. Philosoma has taken the best elements of shooters long past, and thrown them together into one game. Pretty much every angle imaginable is used, from typical side-scroller to  an in-front-of-your-craft angle, shooting backwards.  The graphics are decent, if not a little lackluster. The backgrounds are generally pretty dull, but it's the enemies and obstacles that really count. There're plenty of things to blow up, as well as numerous  power ups and weapons to choose from. Control is fluid and responsive as well. There's nothing here that hasn't been done before, but what is here is done pretty well.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
