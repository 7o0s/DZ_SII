Yeah, you. You think a bowling physics engine is funny, eh? Well, uh, er, it is. The best bowling engine on the PlayStation has returned for more, um, wild nights of...lane polishing madness and Brunswick Pro Bowling 2 has delivered it in exactly the same form as last year's effort.  THQ and Adrenalin hooked up once again to produce the serious bowler's companion, but despite ~all of the changes,~ which were in fact very few, the game is essentially an updated version of last year's Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling.   Gameplay There is a lot to say, and yet, so very little, when it comes to bowling. Here, the best part of the game is the actual setting up and pitching of the ball, and watching the ball and pins do their, er, um, thing. Everything else is really just icing on the proverbial cake. Just like last year's effort, the physics of the ball and the machinations of the pins as they are struck are amazing. Add any amount of power of spin (displayed with two new meters that are much more handy than last year's) and let her rip. The pins, when hit, simulate exactly what you saw when you first bowled, a wild mayhem of spinning, bouncing, and movement until the last one stops. Just like in real life, these pins may bounce off the walls and back into each other to turn your spare into a strike, or your seven into a nine. However the pins fall, the game's physics engine is still as solid as ever.   With this variety of modes, Tournament, Team Play, Skins Game, Skills Challenge, Pro Career, Amateur Career, and Cosmic Bowl, you won't go for lack of bowling options. The Skills Challenge is the most creative and challenging, enabling you to knock down various formations of pins, and testing your honed skills. But everything else is pretty much right out of last year's playbook.   As for the new items, well, there are some improvements, but they are merely refinements at best. The best change is the interface for the bowling experience itself. The left-hand camera angle shows the angle you're going to throw and draws a line from where you stand, displaying the curve and the angle from which the ball is thrown. The camera angles switch (it seems randomly) once the ball has been thrown to about four different angles, adding a kind of anticipation.   The Create-A-Player mode has females now, and what looks to be a few more additions. But I have to tell you, this is a truly no-frills mode that's as dull as pavement. No matter whom you create, the selection characteristics of meager. First, the different faces aren't that different at all. What's worse is that from the lane, you can't even tell the difference because the graphics are so crude. Second, the females are butt ugly. I mean a butt looks good next to these raunchy howlers. They look like ugly men with women's bodies, which doubles the pain. It just makes me shudder. (OK, the men are abominable, too, but still, uhhhh....). Last but not least are the cheesy logos that appear on the back of your player's tacky shirt. A peace sign? Skull and cross-bones? Yin-Yang? You've got to be kidding. Oh, I forgot, another distinguishing aspect of the create-a-player mode -- the choice of glasses. Which specs should you choose?   Graphics Wow! So much has happened since last year graphically on PlayStation. We had Tony Hawk, Driver, Final Fantasy VIII, Legacy of Kain, Sled Storm, and a bunch of other games that showed just how much the PlayStation still has left in it. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Brunswick 2. In fact, the graphics last year were passable because the game was so good, but since only a few tiny little aspects were reworked in this game, and the graphics not being one of them, it's hard not to fault this game for its unimaginative, slow, and painfully weak graphics. For instance, there is only one moving thing on the screen, you, the bowler. You set up, take the stance, and then deliver. There is a phenomenal amount of slowdown, a crunchingly slow framerate, and it looks as if a strobe light is displaying a dysfunctional robot with a bad back. The crowd is literally an unmoving strip of fat people -- check it out yourself -- with bored postures, and they're all painted in a dull brown palette. Your opponent isn't even on the screen with you. It's hapless.   Going back to the create-a-player section for a second, my first time out in the amateur career mode, I battled it out with one young woman, and three grandparents. I don't know if the game generated these opponents or not, but if I could have made these ~things~ with my own selections, I would burned rubber back to the store from which I had bought them out of sheer fright. These were four pug-dog, raisin-faced shoe horns with pear shaped bodies and feet the size of baby mice. It was like these bowlers had their feet wrapped up for centuries before they were freed from their bonds, only to become skilled bowlers.   Last but not least is the animation department (you thought you would get away easy, didn't you Adrenalin?). Few animations actually exist in this priceless game, but the one that caught my eye was one special ~Thruster~ victory dance. You nail a strike. The crowd (that doesn't move) goes wild. You are filled with a triumph of unparalleled joy and power. You love yourself now more than ever. And then you do the dance. The crazy dance. Imagine a bad dancer with an invisible hoola-hoop around their hips and they're swinging their hips back and forth like an uninhabited cow on two feet. Now, imagine you're in a bowling contest, and you do that in front of, well, whomever. But it's on TV! On TV! Oh, the shame! But it's not over. Then comes the finale. You wind your stiff hips into a heated blur and then in a passionate frenzy of uncontrolled furious intoxication, you thrust them forward with a gyrating sexy thrust, POW! And THE CROWD GOES WILD.   Needless to say, the graphics and the insane animations of this game (in the fifth year of the PlayStation) are shoddy at best.   Sound The ball rolls, and it sounds just like it does in real life. The ball hits the pins, which fly off everything in their paths, and it sounds like real pins being hit by a real bowling ball. They're good effects, and that's all you really get.   As for the music, I think Adrenalin has something going here. The music ranges from generic heavy soul to hip-hop to '60s go-go music, and whether it sounds silly or not, the music is much better than just about everything else in the game (bowling physics aside, of course). Taking place in a bowling alley makes the pretty all right music sound unrealistically live and overly energetic, but somehow it keeps up the pace. After all, bowling is more boring than watching golf, so something has to keep the pace going. Despite all of the criticism, this game is a little better than last year's effort, specifically in the easy to use power and spin meters, the practice modes, and the better (but still pathetic) Create-A-Player mode. The game is really more of an upgrade, or add-on disc, than an actual sequel, so if you own the first one, don't go running to the store for this year's effort. But if you must have a bowling game, this or Ten Pin Alley are the best.", "date": "Feb 23, 2000"}
