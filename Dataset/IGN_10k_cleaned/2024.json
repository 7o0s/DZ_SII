Namco's first title, Namco Museum, was a near-perfect conversion of five classic Namco arcade games on the system, and the initial sales on that game (the number eight selling game on the Top 10 list as of this writing) shows that handheld gamers still appreciate the pick-up-and-play-ness of the original arcade titles. Pac-Man Collection, Namco's second GBA title, is another compilation of pre-existing Namco titles, and each one of these games work extremely well on the portable hardware. Though each of these four titles follows a similar theme (Pac-Man), there's plenty of variety in here and will find its way in your system more often than you may think. Features Four classic Pac-Man games Setting adjustments for each game Online tips for each game Only for Game Boy Advance  Pac-Man was the game back in the early days of videogames, with a simple-but-effective concept -- eat all the dots before the enemy critters get you. It was an idea that existed before (in the 1970s game Dodge 'Em), but Pac-Man popularized it...and other companies copied it. Namco continued the name-sake in several follow-ups, including the much more popular Ms. Pac-Man (which can be found in Namco Museum GBA). This pack for the Game Boy Advance brings four of the Pac-Man games to life on the handheld, and all of them have been converted extremely well.  It wouldn't be a Pac-Man compilation pack without the original Pac-Man, and, like the conversion of Ms. Pac-Man in Namco Museum, this version is near arcade perfect.  It can be played in two modes -- in full-screen mode, all the action is held on a static screen, but the image detail takes a serious hit. In scroll mode, the game has perfect pixel resolution, but because of the vertical arrangement of the maze, the screen must scroll up and down to follow the action. You can hit the L and R button to manually slide the screen up and down to glance at the location of the off-screen ghosts. The audio here has been sampled from the arcade machine, so the intro and intermission music is absolutely spot-on, compared to Ms. Pac-Man on the GBA where the tunes weren't quite right. The familar ~wakka wakka~ and constant siren noise is here as well...it's a brilliant conversion of the most popular arcade machine ever. And I wish I could tell you that the ~patterns~ work on this game, but I never memorized them...sorry.  Pac-Mania is a fantastic conversion of the 1987 update to the Pac-Man brand, bringing the action closer and more 3D by creating an isometric angle. Everything in the game has a pre-rendered, futuristic look with detailed colors and shading. The game design is the same -- eat dots, avoid ghosts, eat ghosts. But Pac-Mania adds one simple element to the mix -- the ability to jump. Since the maze has well more than the standard four ghosts floating around, Pac-Man needs more of a defensive capability, and this jump comes in extremely handy...until the ghosts learn the move in the later levels. Pac-Mania is a bit slower paced than the original, but it's still a lot of fun to play through. The GBA conversion is a one-to-one pixel conversion, which means the action doesn't fit as much on the LCD screen as it did on the arcade version's vertical screen -- the GBA screen has to scroll vertically a lot more than the arcade version did. Which means it's a lot harder to tell when ghosts are heading ahead or behind you. Pac-Man Arrangement is, without a doubt, the most elaborately designed games in the pack. Here, you've got the basic Pac-Man theme of eating the maze of dots, avoiding the ghosts until you manage to munch a power-pill to turn the tables temporarily. But what's added is deceptively complex: a fifth ghost named Kinky. This guy can combine with any of the other four ghosts to create a brand new, huge ghost with special abilities. If he blends with a red ghost, the two become a giant bull ghost that will charge Pac-Man if he sees him. If Kinky melds with the pink ghost, the two become a giant bunny ghost that can hop to any location on the maze (noted by a target). If the blue ghost gets combined, they'll turn into a large blue ghost that can split into two parts, and float around the board doing double damage. Kinky and the orange ghost will turn into a large orange ghost that will spit larger dots out on the field, and these dots will slow Pac-Man when he eats them. On the plus side, Kinky, by himself, can be eaten without a power-pill most of the time, so keep a watch out for his spontaneous change.  You'll also find varying maze designs that go uphill and downhill, feature teleport locations, as well as Dash points that will zip Pac-Man in the direction of the arrows, knocking ghosts temporarily dizzy if they get in his way. And, of course, no current videogame is complete without power-ups, and you'll find a few here that will work to your advantage in the mazes -- eat a certain power-up pill and Pac-Man can temporarily split in two to cover double the area, or trap ghosts in a burlap sack, or turn ghosts into presents. It's weird, fast-paced and a lot of fun, and it's an action game you may never have played before -- I've personally only seen the game in an arcade once in my life. Where the arcade version held the action on one static screen, the GBA conversion requires the screen to scroll up and down to follow the action. It's not distracting, though, as you've probably never played the arcade version of Pac-Man Arrangement anyway...  Finally, we have Pac-Attack, a Tetris-style puzzle title featuring Pac-Man and ghosts as tile pieces. This game came out in 1993 for the Super NES and Genesis, and also shipped with Pac-Man: Special Color Edition on the Game Boy Color. The idea is to fit falling groups of bricks and ghosts in such a way that a line of bricks will disappear, much like Tetris. Ghosts will only disappear if eaten by a Pac-Man tile. The Pac-Man tile will move in the direction he's pointing, and eat ghosts until it reaches a dead-end -- then it disappears, and the rest of the pile falls into place. It's a clever puzzle game, but it's definitely no Tetris. But it adds a bit of variety to the whole package if you're sick of the ~eating dots~ thing.  The entire compilation doesn't go beyond what it sets out to do -- offer perfect conversions of great Pac-Man games. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have more -- the Pac-Man engine was used in many, many different Pac-Man games during the big arcade days, games like Pac-Man Plus with its invisible mazes and Coca-Cola cans, and Super Pac-Man, a quick-and-cool Pac-Man game where the character can unlock doors and grow to immense sizes. Let's not forget Jr. Pac-Man, the horizontally scrolling Pac-Man title with huge mazes and giant dots. And, while Link Cable mode might have added a bit more to the game's development, the return of the awesome two-player mode from Pac-Man: Special Color Edition would have been fantastic -- you haven't played Pac-Man until you've eaten and sent all four of your ghosts to your opponent on a separate maze. The game lacks a battery to save high-scores, but that's a small complaint as each of these arcade machines wiped clean when the power turned off. All of these games are loads of fun to play, some more so than others -- Pac Attack is probably considered the loser of the bunch, but even this one has some merits in the compilation pack. Four games on one cartridge for the Game Boy Advance's low-end pricing. It's absolutely worth it, even if you bought Namco Museum just for Ms. Pac-Man.", "date": "Jul 16, 2001"}
