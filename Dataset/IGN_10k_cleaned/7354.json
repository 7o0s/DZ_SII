Among the continuing flood of RPGs slated for release this year, Sony has taken it upon themself to port over the latest role-playing outing from the producer of Wild Arms, Legend of Legaia.   The name ~Wild Arms~ alone is enough to cause a frenzy within the audience of RPG fanatics, since the game is still, after two years, one of the system's foremost titles in the genre. With its 3D polygonal battles and well-designed and developed characters, Wild Arms remains a memorable bright spot during the PlayStation's earlier RPG doldrums right before the release of FFVII. But now with Legend of Legaia, what have the producers learned from their previous outing?   Above and beyond storyline and characters, Legaia's main is its highly inventive battle engine. With random combat still a factor in traditional RPGs, Legaia has sought to vary the experience by putting in place an unique type of battle interface that places the game almost in the realm of a quasi-fighter. When entered in battle, each of the three characters in the game (Vahn, Noa, Gala) possess a bar or gauge which measures how many physical moves they are able to execute during each turn. The moves consist of different ~strike zones~ on an enemy: Left Arm (Weapon), Right Arm, Upper, Lower. Therefore, if an enemy is hovering above ground, a lower leg attack is rendered useless or if it's slim, any attacks to its sides (using the Right Arm) is also pointless. The character commands are entered manually, dictated by the directions on the controller (i.e. Right Arm attack = press right on the D-pad or analog stick, etc.). Therefore, commands can be strung in to create killer combos and multiple hits on a single enemy, increasing the interaction the player has with most RPG battle interfaces. Very cool stuff!  And on occasion, a special combination of moves in battle will result in learning a new ~Arts~ move, which will not only increase the amount of damage inflicted to the enemy, but also deduct a set amount of Art Points (or AP) from the specific character's AP gauge. The result of this innovative battle system makes for some intense battles and some incredibly strategic playmaking during especially brutal fights against tough enemies. Legaia definitely aims to up the ante in terms of how battles are played in future RPGs and how designers approach the usual one-button push tedium of most traditional titles. But, physical attacks aren't the only way to win a battle in Legaia.   The magic system, though very conventional at its core, does provide a little flexibility in its management. Because of how the game's enemies are divided throughout, certain foes will harbor special abilities that your party can learn in battle. In order to do this, one of your characters must defeat the specific monster during a fight without using any magic to deliver the final blow. Then, and only then, can your character have the chance to absorb the power of the fallen enemy. Afterward, the character who learned the spell will then be able to wield it during battle. The spells range from healing types to destructive single enemy blows, which can decide your fate during a grueling boss fight. The spells, themselves, can also gain levels throughout the game with repeated use. With each new level a spell gains, the magic becomes stronger and possibly takes on new qualities that increase your powers in battle.   Visually, Legaia does some interesting two-stepping throughout. Illustrated completely in 3D, the game's polygonal characters and environments may give gamers a weird warm familiar feeling. It's most likely because the on screen characters so clearly resemble those from FFVII, from over a year ago. Cutesy and superdeformed on the world map and in towns, the character designs and environments only really come to life during battle, when their fully fleshed out, proportional counterparts enter the picture. While the battle sequences show the characters full-sized, you'll find yourself almost wanting to see them in their full-forms in all other areas of the game, as well. Despite its clean layouts, the graphics feels woefully outdated and muted atop bland landscapes. But, then again, visuals only weigh in so much at the scale for an RPG with a strong storyline populated by deep characters, right?   In this category, Legaia seems to give its all, but never quite makes it to the finishing line. The game tells the tale of a young warrior named Vahn who vows to rid the land of the evil mist that has been plaguing his village ever since he can remember. The mist, which plays a big part in determining which enemies you'll find in which area, has settled across the landscape, turning humans into psychotic slaves to the Serus (magical ornamental creatures which had helped humans) that they wear. The Serus themselves have also gone stark raving loony, attacking any humans who happen to wander too closely to the Mist. But after saving his own small village from the encroaching threat of the Mist, Vahn discovers the power of the legendary Genesis Trees. The trees not only banish the Mist in the immediate area, but some of them also harbor mysterious Ra-Serus, which are unaffected by the Mist and seek to aid humans in destroying the source of it. Equipped with his own Ra-Seru, Vahn sets out to revive each of the Genesis Trees scattered throughout the kingdom.   Along the way, Vahn joins forces with two other wandering souls who have been called by the Ra-Seru within the Genesis Trees: Noa and Gala. Noa, a young girl raised by a wolf and Gala, a powerful Biron monk, both have questions of their own that can only be answered by following their mission to the end, where they must face off with the evil which created the Mist in the first place. While nowhere near a breakthrough in storyline, the way in which the story interweaves so directly with the action in the game is an interesting features that may be enough to draw gamers in. Unfortunately, many of the little details which usually serve to make an RPG truly charming or its character endearing are missing from Legaia. Most of the personality and quirk in the game come off as feeling incredibly superficial despite a decent translation and some interesting features.   On top of the fundamentals, Contrail has gone the distance to provide a whole host of mini-games, secrets and collectibles to keep the hardcore fans busy for 50+ hours. In contrast to more recent RPGs like Guardian's Crusade, Legaia is nowhere near an overnight game. The fights can be incredibly taxing and the sheer amount of items to collect from activities like a slot game, a battle arena and even a fishing side game are enough to make a role-playing veteran's head spin. There are even multiple endings decided by how you answer a set of final questions near the end of the game!   In the end, an RPG will always be more valued for its depth , storyline and memorable moments. And whether or not Legaia can pull this off in the face of a slew of similarly strong-looking titles remains in the balance. This is a game for those looking for a new twist in gameplay, rather than storyline or characters, and that might be enough to keep Legaia on the forefront until games like Star Ocean and FFVIII arrive. I wanted to love Legaia... I really, really did! But, while I nowhere near hated the game, it seemed to somehow miss the mark in terms of what I usually find appealing in an RPG of this length, caliber and background. Just like anybody else, Wild Arms is still one of my favorite RPGs on the PlayStation and I expected a lot from Legaia from the getgo. I wanted to have that same feeling that I got when I first saw the intro to Wild Arms  that ~I have to play this game NOW!~ feeling, but it never really happened with Legaia. Not 10 hours into the game, not 20 and not even 40. The characters never succeeded in grabbing my interest or sympathies and the storyline is so slow moving at times that I actually lost track of what I was doing! But in its favor, Legaia does have a few moments where its pace picks up (most notably in Sol) and some of the side missions do provide some interesting backbone to the story. Luckily, the game does have one of the more engrossing battle systems in an RPG. The sense of constant discovery in terms of learning new moves, gaining new magic spells and figuring out cool new ways to win against tough enemies is really all that its cracked up to be. And the amount of secrets and curiosities were also very well designed. It almost feels like a Final Fantasy game in terms of how many stinking items I ended up with as well as how many questions I had about stuff like ~What was that kid saying about that stray dog?~ or ~I wonder what happens if I win the Battle Tournament on Expert Difficulty!~. This is just that kind of game. If you don't mistake Legaia for a grandiose, sweeping epic that you'll remember for eons and you simply want a tough, challenging RPG to plod through before tackling the upcoming lineup of role-playing titles, this is a solid choice. If you can forego the game's lack of genuine personality or appeal, you may find that there's enough meat to keep yourself pressing on through the game.", "date": "Mar 18, 1999"}
