{"name": "The Next Tetris", "name_review": "The Next Tetris", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/29/the-next-tetris", "text": "If you surf the web, you've probably had the chance to sample a million varieties of the Tetris formula, from new colors to odd shapes, and even a creepy number called ~SexTris.~ You don't want to know. After all these years, no one's been able to snatch the magic and playability of Tetris and bottle it into a new gameable form, though some have come close. Puzzle Bobble is certainly as addictive, and Puyo Puyo has similar brain-numbing qualities, but still, it's funny that nothing has come as close as those games which take directly from the Tetris formula. Even the creator of Tetris Alexey Pajitnov lives in the shadow of his own creation, despite some attempts to create ~The Next Tetris~ (check out his latest creation Pandora's Box for some more addictive fun) over the years. Now Hasbro has gone as far as to imprint its newest game with the near-blasphemous title ~The Next Tetris,~ and guess what? It comes close to delivering a true variation on the Tetris formula -- though the title should technically be ~The Next Tetris Game With Some Breakable Blocks Added.~   The Nitty Gritty, Kitty  You've played Tetris before, so I don't need to go into the details of how the game is played -- just to add that if you haven't played it before, then you should really get a little less of a life. The most major difference in TNT are the ~Multiminos,~ standard Tetris blocks made of different colors that break apart when they land. Because using ~Multiminos~ in a standard Tetris game would make it much too easy, the developers have opted to force you to use garbage blocks in a standard game -- the major bane of TNT. Wondering how the new blocks look? I think I have a couple in my pocket...         On the left, we have exhibit one: your average Tetris piece. On the right, we have the Next Tetris piece, in a variety of colors. If you place a piece above or around piece of the same color, they'll stick together to form a larger glob of that color. Park that piece over different colors though, and the multi-colored Tetris pieces will break up, and continue their descent, if possible.  The Garbage Problem  Breakable blocks change the dynamics of how a Tetris game is played, primarily because of the need for garbage blocks. Single player games give you a time limit and a garbage height to deal with, while the marathon game keeps you in motion in level after level of garbage-filled blockdom. A puzzle mode gives you specific time limits and garbage configurations to get rid of, which start out fairly simple, but quickly get maddening (but isn't that what good puzzles are supposed to do?) Unfortunately, unless you choose the classic mode, you can't play a continuous game, only a series of short missions. It takes away a fundamental element of Tetris that only gets worse in two-player.   With two-player games, you and an opponent get similar garbage blocks that you must try to get rid of first. Because of the breaking blocks and the different goal, combos become much less vital to winning against an opponent. The key to slaying in TNT is to break off small pieces when possible, and get rid of lines quickly in order to get out the garbage. Instead of creating garbage with combos, TNT flips the opponent's screen around like a top, and confuses gameplay for a matter of seconds, becoming crazier with the amount of lines scored in a combo. It's a fun (and nauseating) concept, but one which doesn't work nearly as well as being able to toss a pile of junk into your enemies' already bursting playing field. The fact that the game only keeps score up to three games also ruins any chances of marathon gaming sessions, where the score can head up into triple digits, for those of you with the willpower, stamina, and eye-strength. The one fantastic concept involved with two-player is a sort of ~normalization~ feature, which keeps track of losses, and averages out handicaps depending on how much one player is winning. If you're slaying a particularly horrible opponent, you may find that the game ups the amount of garbage that you get, or speeds up your gameplay. If you're still slamming their face in the ground, then it may lower their speed. It guarantees that no matter who you play, you can still have an even gaming experience.  The ability to save a player name which keeps track of your level (changing the skill depending on how well you play, like the two-player game) is a major bonus, especially if you want to test out your brainpower against friends and family members -- it's a great feature that acts intuitively with the way you play. Unfortunately, you can't actually pick difficulty levels on your own, which is ridiculous for a game like Tetris, which has always been about customizing your game experience. It may make the game more easily accessible, but for veteran blockheads, it keeps the gameplay at a lukewarm, but not exciting level.  The Next Tetris really does add some new tricks that make the game worth playing, but the lack of options and customizability keep it from being as addictive as it should be. It's sad -- the core ideas behind the game are really fantastic, but the implementation is wonky at best. For Tetris fanatics this is a perfect addition to your addiction library, but if you're looking for blocky salvation, than you may find that TNT provides the glitter of nostalgia more than a completely new experience.  -- Vincent ~Alright I'll Stop Using .8's and .3's~ Lopez", "date": "Oct 29, 1999"}
