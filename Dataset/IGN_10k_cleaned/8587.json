If you want a good land war game, all you have to do is go down to the local software store and you can choose from dozens. And if you want a flight sim, there's no power on this earth that could keep one from you. But if you want a good naval strategy game, you're stuck with playing a game that's over five years old. Now some of you are saying, ~Okay, Steve. We see your point. But the thing is, RTS in a navy game sucks.~ You're right, but that's only because it hasn't been done right yet.  That's why I was so excited to get the chance to review Jane's Fleet Command. First off, Jane's has stood for accuracy and depth; not only in its publications but also in its simulations. For nearly 100 years now, Jane's has been the source for quick and detailed information on naval matters throughout the world. Incidentally, Jane is not a woman-it's the last name of the guy who started the whole series in 1904. Now I've saved you the embarrassment of looking stupid at the next defense contractor meeting.  While it's not what I expected, I liked this game. The controls are very basic but there's still a lot of depth to the orders. The graphics are pretty remarkable. On top of that, the game is exciting and has quite a bit of action. The last thing a wargame needs is to be boring. Despite all the advantages this game has, it still falls short in some significant respects.  All of the action in the game is controlled by the mouse. Left click to select a platform (a platform is anything that carries a weapon), right click to assign it a task. The various views and displays in the game are controlled from the keyboard. Switching back and forth between views while also giving orders is a totally painless process. You will balk at the nearly 100 key commands but rest assured that you won't need them all. Still, keyboard control is essential to respond in anything approaching a timely manner, so you'll be getting to know some of the keys pretty well.  You can assign all sorts of commands to your platforms. Primarily you will send them to engage or identify other units. Occasionally you will be required to do something a little more fancy. Your helicopter, for example, can perform rescue operations for downed pilots. Carriers will need to keep aircraft in rotation so that you can maintain air superiority. You can also set the altitude and depth of your air and submarine units. Platforms may be grouped but you have no control over the formation that they assume. This sort of defeats the purpose of keeping units in groups, but it still speeds up combat.  You'll be commanding some of the most modern ships in the world arsenal. There are cruisers and destroyers, subs and carriers and quite a few aircraft types as well. The attention to detail here is remarkable until you consider it's a Jane's product. In terms of realism, every platform looks and behaves uniquely. There's a handy, and none-too-shabby, online reference in the game. Each platform has a page of stats, a photo and a rotating 3D model so you can get a closer look.  The ships themselves look spiffy. Although they are extremely blocky, you can get really close and see all kinds of details. There are even planes and trucks on the decks of the carriers. That's a great touch. Missiles and planes look as stiff as the ships sometimes, but they still look good. The various missile effects and pyrotechnics are alright. The smoke trails are the only things that look really bad. Graphic changes have also been incorporated into the environment. Various times of day, weather and sea state graphics are more than just visual additions, however. They also force you to shift your style of play.  The gameplay is handled on a flat map. Icons representing the platforms are located here. When you select a platform, its status is displayed in a side window. Here you can view weapon load outs, fuel level and damage status. Make sure you're only committing units with high ammo loads to intense combat. This flat map can be zoomed in or out. Zooming in is often necessary to get enough space between your units to select them individually.  While the 2D view is very practical for ordering ships around, it isn't very exciting to look at. That's where the 3D view comes in. You can zoom in and out of this as well and rotate it fully around the targets. You can even view the underside of ships. Often a torpedo hit will show as a hole in the ship's hull. The 3D view can be tethered to a specific platform, or it can be unattached and free roaming. While they aren't the greatest graphics around, I really got a sense of these ships interacting with each other in real space.  So there's a downside too. First off, the manual doesn't explain nearly enough. Of the 44 pages, only four are focussed on explaining gameplay-another four are saved for key commands. That's simply not enough; not for a game this involved. And the tutorials aren't much help either. They explain the basics of some of the individual actions-i.e. how to ID a craft, how to shoot down a missile-but they never explain how to fight a whole battle against a large and quick enemy. The bones of 645 US sailors beneath the Straights of Malacca attest to my ignorance.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the campaigns are never entirely clear either. The amount of intel you receive before hand is minimal and I was often unsure how to proceed through them. Worse still, the campaigns are a little one-sided in favor of the Communists...and the Indians. The play of the missions seems a little stiff sometimes as well.  The campaign is polarized around traditional Cold War ideologies. Russia wants to take the Kuril Islands from Japan. China is strong-arming Burma and Taiwan. India has turned its attention from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. You are to sail your Carrier Battle Group, or CVBG, from India to Japan and defuse these various threats to world peace. Each mission has degrees of success and you have to get higher and higher completion percentages if you want to get very far. There are also thirty separate single missions which you can play individually. They're divided into four levels so you can work yourself up to a challenge.  The mission editor is difficult to use and I could never quite get the hang of it. In the absence of any Communist side of the campaign game, this is where you come to command the Russian boats. They've got some sweet subs too. It doesn't seem like the options are laid out to make selection easy. Everything is in these layered pull-down menus so you have to know exactly what you're looking for before you can find it. On top of that, the map where you place the pieces is ridiculously small. This means that by the time you've placed a dozen units, you can't see too much more of the map.  Naval warfare sims are few and far between in this business and it's hard to pass one up. Even if it's only mostly good. Perhaps someday the ships will rank right up there with the planes and the tanks, but it ain't happening anytime soon. If you do have a serious John Paul Jones for naval action (and I think you know who you are), then you should seek help. That's just not healthy, man. If, on the other hand, you like ship fights that are intriguing and multi-layered, Jane's is the ticket. It's a little thin in areas but it's still a lot of fun.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jun 16, 1999"}
