Of course you don't. You didn't buy this game. Nobody did. There are barely 400 names on one of the course leaderboards and just under a thousand on another.   Annnnyway, this $10 PlayStation Network title that was originally released in January has returned with a $7 expansion pack -- called Toy Home Expansion Pack -- containing three new game modes, four new stages, a multiplayer bump and six new cars.   But don't stomp on the gas just yet, that stuff sounds a lot better than it really is.   Big air! If you missed my first review of Toy Home, I'm happy to summarize what it's all about -- but for in-depth thoughts, you should really check out my previous 6.7. Basically, you choose one of eight windup-looking vehicles -- there's now a monster truck, racecar and more in addition to the original hot rod and mini cooper -- and set them loose on a level desigined to look like an area of the everyman home. Before you ran through a boy's room and a kitchen, but now you gain access to a girl's room and a birthday party-themed living room. These rooms are filled with coins, colored checkpoints and obstacles. You need to take your ride through the checkpoints before time runs out.   Beyond that, you'll need to jump to different platforms, smash into obstacles for time bonuses and boost to make it over giant crevices. While you're doing all of this, the game's giving you pats on the back with compliments such as ~Cowabunga~ and ~Killer Moves~ as well as scoring the performance. You finish the level, get a total and then are ranked.   So, yay. You're up to speed on how the game works. Back in January, I commended the game for its colorful graphics and environments that felt destructive, but I also ragged on it for making me play the eight tracks in order, having a weak/laggy multiplayer, and forcing folks to use the Sixaxis.   Only one of those problems appears to have been addressed. Playing the tracks in order isn't a problem anymore because along with the addition of four rooms, Toy Home has also added three modes. The Expansion Tour lets you tackle the four new courses in order, All Star Tour is a four-level circuit that chooses two rooms from both the old and new lists, and Free Run Mode lets you choose whichever course you want and have at it.   On the multiplayer side, I still feel like Toy Home is a weak offering even though this expansion pack bumps the maximum online and offline number of players from two to four. To begin with, it's just not that fun to drive around these massive levels looking for little cars, but beyond that, no one is playing this anymore -- course 12 has just 32 names on the leaderboard.   Awesome. How do I leave? Finally, Sixaxis remains the only method of control for your vehicles, and I wish that wasn't the case. No, I don't hate motion control, but I do hate falling off tight turns while I'm trying to climb a set of ramps and get to my final objective. It happened more than once, and it's because you can't corner tightly by turning your hands. Most of the time, you have a large area to work with, so the controls never feel too bad, but when it gets to crunch time -- like driving over a thin bridge -- they're sure to piss you off.Here's what it comes down to -- this expansion should have been free. The developers are just adding stuff that should've been in the original (which only had two cars and eight tracks) and charging you for it again. I thought $10 was too much to charge for the original game. If all of this stuff would have been in there for $10, I probably wouldn't have been so offended as a consumer, but they're not even giving it to you now. They're asking you to fork over another $7 for what should've been in the original title. Seventeen bucks for a game you've probably already played through and that no one's playing online? No thanks.", "date": "Mar 14, 2008"}
