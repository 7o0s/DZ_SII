Whether they wanted to know what became of the Kingdom of Baron in Final Fantasy IV or were curious about the future of Midgar in Final Fantasy VII, there's always somebody somewhere wishing that they could experience just a little bit more. Always hoping that they could go back to the world they spent so many hundreds of hours exploring to find out what happened next.   Up until now, however, it's always been a wish that's never been fulfilled. Despite the begging, pleading, and letter-writing campaigns that has seen fans clamor for future episodes of their favorite stories, Square Enix has never humored any of them. Choosing instead to push forward with new characters and new worlds while allowing its previous productions to fade off into history as a collection of pleasant memories.   But we suppose that things can change. Because for the first time in history Square Enix has decided to go back and revisit one of its most popular and critically-favored universes. Fresh off a platinum selling run and considered to be one of the best episodes in the franchise, Final Fantasy X has been given the honor of receiving the series' first official follow-up. Already released in Japan with incredibly positive results, Final Fantasy X-2 is now storming into the American market as well; and though it has come under fire by a predominately male audience as nothing more than a ~girly~ approach to the series, it doesn't change the fact that X-2 is still among the best RPGs on the PlayStation 2. In fact, it's one of the best overall games for the system, period.   Strategy Guide Available! Fulfill Your Fantasy!  One of the greatest RPG's of all time now has one of the greatest guides ever written. Every mission and sidequest, Dressphere, Garment Grid, secrets and more! You need this guide!  Get the Guide | See Other Guides  Story  In a clever ploy to make the game more accessible to players who may not have enjoyed IGN's RPG of the year in 2001, Final Fantasy X-2 does a great job of presenting its story without revealing too much of what happened in the previous installment. Taking place two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, X-2 reveals a world so different in terms of its philosophy that it's almost impossible to recognize. Though it's cosmetically almost identical to how it looked before, its people and their attitude have changed dramatically: as they're no longer under the oppressive rule of a destructive deity called Sin. As a result, the people of Spira enjoy the freedom of looking forward to an actual future and very much enjoy the simple idea of living out their lives.    At the forefront of this story is the returning Final Fantasy X character, High Summoner Yuna. Enjoying this newfound freedom quite a bit, Yuna has thrown off her formal robes and changed into a pair of revealing shorts as she teams up with her cousin Rikku and their companion Paine. Known as ~YRP~, Rikku, Yuna, and Paine belong to a group of sphere hunters named the Gullwings and set out on a series of adventures to locate their world's hottest new commodity. Of course, none of this ever would have happened if not for the mysterious sphere that Rikku discovered months earlier -- inside of which revealed evidence of a man that looks very much like FFX's Tidus struggling to escape an unknown captor. Is it really him or just someone who looks like him? That's what Yuna is determined to find out!   Part of what makes Final Fantasy X-2 so intriguing, though, is its decidedly different scope. Not nearly as epic as the previous ~save the world from Sin~ premise, the plotline in X-2 is still vastly intriguing. Though it expands on the earlier game's position of individuality and friendship, X-2 is really about accepting change and the consequence that comes with progress. A deep political drama at its heart, there's a powerful subplot that turns out to be much bigger than what's originally bargained for; and before you know it, the world is on the brink of war when Spira's two most powerful factions (The Youth League and New Yevon) begin competing with one another for spheres.   Despite its underlying message and eventual turn towards more sobering material, X-2 always manages to keep from taking things too seriously. Packed with a good deal of comedy and silly throwaway lines to evoke genuine laughter, YRP's adventure through Spira is greatly helped by its loose storytelling and frequent reverence to the original. Most importantly, though, Final Fantasy X-2 treats its history with intelligence. The location of the final battle with Sin, for instance, isn't treated as holy ground or a sacred spot where ex-worshipers of Yevon go to pray. Instead, it's become a tourist attraction for people to ooh and ah and celebrate their freedom -- not unlike our own civil war battlegrounds here in America. Probably what would really happen if that situation were authentic isn't it?    But more importantly, the game's treatment of its returning characters is just as clever. Though a lot of them may not have become what we had originally imagined, almost all of them have grown beyond what they used to be: transforming themselves out of their roles as inconsequential or moderate supporting characters and into that of important antagonists with significant effects on the storyline. Dona, Isaaru, the Aurochs, and a host of other players have all returned with new and interesting parts that see surprises we didn't expect. Our only real complaint here is that there wasn't enough Lulu to appease our personal tastes -- ask anyone: they'll tell you she rocks.   Mission Structure  Unlike previous Final Fantasies, Final Fantasy X did away with the familiar third-person overworld map used in its prequels and moved towards a menu-based system instead. Less random and much more to the point, it served as a quicker means of delivering the story bits without resigning the player to hours of wandering through an unknown field. If gamers wanted to stick around and level up their characters, however, they could do so by moving about the area they selected; this way they could at least choose where they wanted to level up at and do so for as long as they wanted without having to travel to that location on foot.   Final Fantasy X-2 works in a similar way and brings back the menu-driven map system used in X. But rather than have to earn your way from spot to spot through the storyline, X-2 allows its players to go anywhere on the atlas anytime they want. Because of this open-ended mission structure, users can move the storyline forward whenever they choose too -- with none of the accidental plot activation that we sometimes see in games of this type. To identify the difference between sections of the map that are directly related to the advancement of the story, key areas are given ~Hot Spot~ designations and flash all sorts of red and yellow. There are 14 storyline missions in all spread out across five chapters so they aren't hard to miss.    But don't be fooled by the relatively small number of plot quests, as X-2 is unbelievably huge. With 15 different cities and environments to choose from in each chapter in addition to numerous sub-quests and bonus games, there's more to do here than there was in Final Fantasy X. Of particular note is are the five different endings that players can go after with multiple points in the adventure where their decisions alter the storyline. Though truthfully, the most welcome feature of any of these, is probably the New Game + option. With it, you'll be able to go back and re-live everything complete with experience and abilities intact -- and give yourself the opportunity to play through again while making different choices for the other endings.   Mini-Games  Regardless of how many sidequests or bonus missions you choose to participate in, the sheer amount of mini-games available to you can be a nigh overwhelming. Obtainable in story and sidequest modes both, the time-wasters available in X-2 may overshoot every RPG in existence in terms of secondary activities. While some of them may be as simple as dressing up in a giant Moogle suit and passing around balloons to festive onlookers, other tasks can include super-complicated tests of skill and dexterity; like the Tower Calibration at the Thunder Plains or the Reptile Races in the Calm Lands. But none of them, and we do mean none of them, hold a candle to our favorite two entries in this category: the Gunner's Gauntlet and the LeBlanc Body Rub.   Initially available in chapter 2, Gunner's Gauntlet is an incredibly intense shooting mini-game that puts Yuna in a race against time. In possession of nothing more than a pair of pistols, the High Summoner must travel the paths of Besaid and sprint for her goal on the beach. Even though there are only five different screens to clear in seven minutes time, the catch is that if Yuna doesn't beat the current high score requirement she automatically loses -- having to repeat the process all over again. The only way to beat the requirement, however, is to rack up combination points by filling your combo meter and blasting your enemies with pistols without getting hit. All the while finding ways to replenish your ammo, earn special shots, and make it to the beach in time. If you want a source of pure unadulterated fun, look no further than here.    Our other favorite is a delight for different reasons altogether: namely, for it's camp value. What we're dubbing the LeBlanc Body Rub, this particular assignment commissions you to massage nine different pieces of LeBlanc's body. And while we won't tell you the circumstances of how this mission comes about or what you receive for accomplishing it, trust us when we say that there are few things in the videogame world as hilarious as this. But that's only the tip of the iceberg; there are plenty of other bonus games as well -- from Chocobo breeding to ticket scalping and more.   But perhaps the most detailed sub-game in Final Fantasy X-2 is the newly formed ~Sphere Break~ (which is to X-2 what Blitzball was to X). Grid-based with a very distant relationship to dominoes, Sphere Break asks players to match numbers and form combinations with a base set of 12 unique coins; Use the correct quota of coins before the turn limit is over, and you can win prizes, money, and more coins. It's pretty much as simple as that. And while this particular mini-game is moderately entertaining the first few times you play it, it just isn't as deep or involving as Blitzball, Tetra Master, or Triple Traid. Particularly bothersome is the fact that you can't look at what kinds of coins you have until you actually start an exhibition-- only then may you see what kind of inventory you have to work with. It's a pretty sloppy setup in that regard, but the majority of X-2's remaining mini-games make up for it.   Dresspheres and Upgrades  Final Fantasy X's sphere grid system was an interesting way to handle the leveling up of characters, but rather than follow that model, Final Fantasy X-2 uses a mixture of several different elements to create a new system of its own. Known as the Dressphere/Garment Grid combo, this setup mixes the level-up ideals behind the sphere grid with the traditional job switching ability used in games like Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics. This combination of styles not only makes for a less confusing upgrade dynamic for burgeoning RPG players, but it also allows for a much more varied set of characters.    Here's how it works: Yuna, Rikku, and Paine can equip Garment Grids as though it was armor and then assign Dresspheres to inhabit its empty nodes (which are connected with paths and gates). When not engaged in a battle, players can select which job they wanted to assume through a menu or by pressing L1 in the middle of a battle when it's that character's turn. Once that's been done and a job class has been selected, that character is ready for battle.   There are almost 20 different classes in all (some of which can be used by specific characters exclusively) and each one of them has explicit and unique abilities available only to that class. The Thief, for instance, can Pilfer Gil or learn an Initiative Strike to earn money or always go first in a round. The Black Mage can learn the most powerful attack spells, and the Alchemist can combine almost any item to create more useful and potent concoctions out of her many ingredients. The only restrictions given to the supply of powers at your command are the number of nodes available in a Garment Grid. If a grid has only four nodes, a character can only switch between four different classes at a time; if it's five nodes, it's five classes, and so on.   To use this system to its fullest, however, players will need to equip their hero with the correct garment grid and use a specific path for upgrades in order to use additional powers. Since ability gates separate most of the Garment Grid nodes, traveling through one of these sections activates a bonus power when changing from one class to another. Should Paine have the ~Terror of the Deep~ Garment Grid equipped, for instance, she'll automatically gain the ability to cast water spells the moment she switches classes regardless of her assigned job -- all because of the Garment Grid's inherent abilities.   But there's more to it than that. As players will also be able to earn special skills for each class based on how many kills the party has while that Dressphere is equipped. If, for example, a Gun Mage skill costs 40 points, then that character will need to be a Gun Mage present for the death of 40 enemies in order to learn that ability. Once that skill is learned, players can assign a new attribute to study and the process is repeated over again. It's simple, effective, and extremely challenging to accomplish a mastery of all skills over the course a game.    Battle System  Much improved over the combat engine found in Final Fantasy X, X-2's battle mechanics are faster, more fluid, and definitely more fun to play. Utilizing the same Active Time bar found in earlier installments, players have to remain on their toes at all times to avoid being destroyed by their enemies. Because the ATB meter begins to count down the moment a melee starts, users will need to come up with their strategies and tactics rather quick; or risk being chopped down by some kind of brutal fiend.   One of the more interesting aspects of the battle system is that it allows you to stop a monster dead in its tracks during one of its assaults. So if a Behemoth is about to come smashing down on top of you and your trio can coordinate their own attacks just right it will knock the creature back before it can strike you -- making the timing of your violence pretty important. Of course, you can further enhance your efficiency by chaining combos together similar to that of Chrono Trigger by ordering YRP to attack in perfect succession. The more perfect the combo, the more deadly the attack and quicker your ATB bar will start filling up again.   Each character class has its own sort of critical attack in addition to its regular one (usually earned and upgraded through the aforementioned Dressphere level-up system). Borrowing its ideas from all previous Final Fantasies and its many characters, these crucial attack types range from rapid-fire bullets and Armor Breaks to special magical assaults and ability stealing. Just another way to make the improvement of your character that much more important, working on these special skills into proves to be of high priority,    But then again so is figuring out how to use the right combination of classes. In the latter chapters especially, certain job types are practically useless against several of the 200+ enemies and it'll be your job to find the best way to combat them. It's because of this predisposed relationship between certain monster types and character classes that allows the job system to work as well as it does; and it helps to move the whole Dressphere idea out of the realm of the gimmick and into the realm of the practical.   That's not to say that we don't have a couple of legitimate gripes about the game though: mainly in relation to FFX-2's difficulty level and some of its finer nuances: specifically with the easy challenge in the first three chapters -- it's just not tough. Obviously built with presentation and story in mind ahead of everything else, the game doesn't pose a problem for gamers when they're fighting compared to the difficulty they'll have with some of the mini-games. And while we appreciate the fact that X-2 is ultimately made shorter into the 40-to-80 hour experience that it is because of this easy approach, we would have loved to see more difficult missions scattered throughout Spira.   Regardless, the game is still immeasurably fun with an addictive quality that several of the system's biggest RPGs seem to lack. We are a bit bummed that we can't import our save from Final Fantasy X, though; it would have made learning Al Bhed and searching for those primers all over again a hell of a lot easier.   Graphics  Final Fantasy X is generally considered to be one of the top five best-looking PlayStation 2 titles ever developed and its sequel is even better. Though it's lacking the progressive scan and widescreen television support we originally hoped it would carry, it's still among the most impressive visual productions we've yet witnessed. Easily on par with recent Xbox heavyweights like Crimson Skies and Soul Calibur II, Final Fantasy X-2's graphics are so enticing that it almost made us forget about the PS2's hardware limitations.   We say ~almost~ because X-2 is imbued with a couple of slowdown hitches in a few choice areas. In fact, there were instances where the chop gets so bad that the framerate drops to as low as 15 frames per second. Luckily this sort of decline was so rare that most people will probably fail to notice it; but because of our addiction to the area where it turns up most (re: the Gunner's Gauntlet), we definitely got an eyeful.    When you consider that this slowdown probably shows up for less than 1% of the entire X-2 experience, however, these technical limitations are more than forgivable -- and players can expect a solid 30fps the majority of the time.   For veterans that have already made it through Final Fantasy X, the game's backgrounds and environments should look pretty familiar. Directly ported from the original code, almost every single area that's available in X-2 had its origins with its predecessor. From the serene shoreline of Besaid to the snowy dangers of Mt. Gagazet, the familiar landscape of Spira is both uniquely separated and lavishly detailed. In order to give the world an appearance different from Final Fantasy X, however, Square Enix has gone back to the source and made a number of subtle and obvious changes. Whether it's the now-bustling port of Kilika or the politically charged city of Bevelle, the effective mix of old and new helps kick the nostalgia factor into overdrive. Fans of the first game will surely appreciate it.   The most noticeable changes, though, are probably found with the characters themselves. Despite the fact that each of the protagonists stays in the same outfit during their overworld explorations, all three of them are still given a bevy of unique costumes to convey their chosen job classes. Mixing an effective blend of proven and recognizable Final Fantasy styles with a revealing neo-modern fashion sense, the uniforms are absolutely brilliant. They're skimpy enough to please the game's predominantly male audience and yet clever enough to delight budding character designers. One of our personal standouts is Yuna's costume change when she becomes a warrior. Borrowing the fighting stance and various clothing elements from FFX hero Tidus, the skintight swordswoman completes her look by wielding the sentimental ~Brotherhood~ blade used by our favorite Blitzball player. It's understated little moves like these that really add an extra bit of personality to game already filled with it.    Speaking of personality, the facial animations are yet another area in which Final Fantasy X-2 improves upon the original. Much more expressive and believable, these faces are as authentic as they come and look even more striking during CGI cut scenes. And since players are given the option to play previously watched cinematics in the Luca Sphere Theater, re-living these amazingly rendered segments can be done over and over again. It's just another example of the high-quality production values and excellent artistry at work.   Sound  There was quite a lot of hubbub made over the fact that Final Fantasy X-2 was the first game in the series not to feature the award-winning composer Nobuo Uematsu. Renowned for his work on previous entries in the franchise, Uematsu's absence created speculation that X-2's soundtrack would suffer horribly. And while the end result definitely isn't as strong as its predecessor, it's still an appropriately fitting backdrop for a game that's decidedly more lighthearted than its earlier prequel.   Composed by the Bouncer and Bahamut Lagoon scribes Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi, Final Fantasy X-2's score will definitely have a lot more bubblegum than fans are used to. Because of the ~freedom~ ideal that X-2 promotes so heavily, the typical set of melancholy tunes and somber melodies are barely existent; and are instead replaced by poppy synth-songs that have repetitious and simplistic structures. Despite these nitpicks, however, the soundtrack still isn't that bad -- in fact, it's better than 80% of your typical RPG fare. It's just that it appears that there's something missing when compared to other Final Fantasies and its ilk. And that's probably because there is, as the legendary fanfare and crystal themes have either been omitted completely or incorporated so subtly into the existing tunes that they're unrecognizable.   But one aspect of the music that does have to be mentioned, though, is the quality of the vocal tracks. Known as ~Real Emotion~ and ~1000 Words~, the two lyrics-based tunes are definitely of a higher pedigree and are benefited by a strong translation from their singer Jade (of Sweetbox fame). Originally performed by the Japanese vocalist Kumi Koda, these tracks are incredibly catchy and in the case of 1000 Words offer up genuine heartfelt emotion that the otherwise upbeat score doesn't usually provide. It's a very poignant song -- especially when taken into context towards what it means in the game.    The songs aren't the only area in which Final Fantasy X-2's vocals shine, however, as the cast of characters should be held in high regard as well. Once again voiced by Foxfire celebrity Hedy Burgess and Bubbles Powerpuff Girl Tara Strong, Yuna and Rikku appear to be more comfortable in their roles and are joined very effectively by Gwendoline Yeo as their companion Paine. Though X-2 does run into a couple of uncomfortable pauses here and there, there's an absolutely gigantic amount of dialogue to be listened to -- possibly as much as what was in Final Fantasy X: the reigning world champion for digitized videogame speech. Needless to say, we're amazed that the sound engineers were able to keep the awkward pauses at such a minimum anyway; truly good work.   Speaking of sound engineering, the quality and technology of the audio is definitely first-class. Recorded in both Dolby Pro Logic II and Dolby Digital EX, players should have a nice array of effects to play with should they join their television set to an enabled receiver. For audiophiles looking for an added bonus, the Sphere Theater in Luca allow listeners to choose which format they'd like to watch their cut scenes in -- either DPL2 or DDEX -- a nice touch for those of us who like to mess around with our speakers; and one that you can definitely tell the difference with should your equipment support it.At the end of the day Final Fantasy X-2 may end up becoming the source of plenty of mixed feelings among hardened fans. As despite its stellar new gameplay additions, wealth of replayability, and absolute mother lode of mini-activities, its concept and presentation could ultimately hurt it. Never mind the fact that it's storyline isn't as strong as X's or that you're limited to only three characters for the entire adventure: here the prejudice is as simple as its perceived ~girlishness~.With the explosive popularity that Final Fantasy X-2 has received in Japan, however, we think that it's safe to assume that the Nippon audience has already come to accept how good Final Fantasy X-2 really is. And we hope that it will only be a matter of time before American players catch on as well -- even if it's female-heavy premise and bouncy atmosphere does alienate a good portion of its machismo fan base.But what else can we say about skeptics' apprehensions other than the fact that it's ~their loss?~ Simply put, X-2 is a brilliant and addictive romp through Spira that we're certainly glad to experience and one that could definitely mark the beginning of future opportunities for the franchise. All the RPG aficionados have to do is give it the chance.And while there's no guarantee that we'll ever get our hands on Final Fantasy X-3 or perhaps a sequel to our personal favorites FFIV and FFVI, it's no longer out of the realm of possibility. After all, the company is already hard at work on its next Final Fantasy follow-up, FFVII: Advent Children. And though Advent Children isn't exactly a videogame, it's still the second bit of proof in as many years that Square Enix is finally beginning to listen to the outcries of its fans; Establishing ever-so slowly, that our hopes of finding out what happened to our favorite characters of journeys past isn't so impossible after all.", "date": "Nov 7, 2003"}
