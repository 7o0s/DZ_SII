And that's only if you're really terrible at it. The new PC game, based off the third book in the wildly popular series, arrives alongside the recent film version of the story and, though it is in many ways a definite improvement over Potters past, there's far too much hand-holding and spoon-feeding in the game's puzzles and fighting sequences for it to ever feel like much of a challenge.  Before launching into the review, I should mention that I haven't yet seen the movie. Those around the office who have seen the film tell me that some of the main plot elements are present here but the actual encounters and gameplay challenges are almost entirely unconnected with the events of the film. So while the plot of the game does indeed involve an escaped prisoner who seems to have it in for Harry, and while the malevolent and suspicious Dementors are still hunting him down, the salamander-freezing, toothed-book shooting, ice sliding, rabbit-statue animating gameplay is entirely the game's invention.  Combat is the most open-ended part of the game but, even so, you'll rarely have the opportunity to try anything terribly sophisticated. In most cases, you'll simply be presented with a few enemies (never more than six at a time) right in front of you. Taking them out never really involves any puzzle elements; you'll simply have to point the mouse at the enemies and click the button. There are some more complicated moments -- having to hold enemies at bay a la Tapper, flipping over enemies and pushing them over ledges, freezing the flame that spawns monsters -- but for the most part the combat is, like the rest of the game, very low-impact.  You don't have to draw spells this time, for instance. Where earlier you were sometimes required to draw specific outlines with your mouse in order to cast spells, this time around, you just have to point the mouse at an interactive object and click the left mouse button. The correct spell will be cast automatically. And how do you find these objects in the world? Well, for the most part, they should be obvious. Lapifors transforms rabbit statues into real, controllable bunnies; Glacius freezes both fountains and fire salamanders; Carpe Refractum draws your character to large, rather obvious blue spheres. In all cases this is simply point and click. The only real challenge is the Expecto Patronum spell where you have to time the release of the spell just right in order for it to be effective. In the case of environmental objects, you'll only have to look for things marked with a giant red chevron in order to know which objects can be affected by spells.  Many of the game's challenges are managed for you so much that the entire game feels a bit like a tutorial for a harder challenge that never comes. This is particularly true of the puzzles where you're actually told how to solve each and every one. There's only one solution to each puzzle and, while there are some secret, optional areas you can reach through more enthusiastic exploring, there's no room to find your own solutions to a given problem. In any case, the path through to your next challenge is always obvious and rarely challenging. Even some of the game's jumping puzzles are managed for you. Simply jump on a green jump tile and you'll automatically be directed to a scripted landing spot.  There are a few puzzles that require you to use multiple characters to escape traps or perform more powerful spells. Unfortunately this cooperative puzzle solving merely relies on pre-scripted switching from one character to another or a follow-the-leader mechanic where your nearby friends automatically prepare to cast whatever spell you're throwing. It would be much more interesting to have the individual characters progress along three different paths, opening up new areas for each other as they switch back and forth. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Fharrypotter_060904_021_1086832299-000.jpg&caption=The bean, pumpkin and cake collecting that pervades the game has no practical benefit for your character during the game, leaving you to wonder what the point is. In fact, the only real use for the beans and such is as currency to buy wizard trading cards. You can even use these to gain access to secret areas of the game where you can collect even more beans. The whole point of this is to get 100% of the items and secrets in the game and qualify for third-year graduation. But since you can actually finish the plot of the game without grabbing each and every little bean and card, there's little incentive to get new cards. Perhaps if they allowed for some sort of gameplay upgrades based on collecting sets of cards it would be more compelling. As it is, it seems like an arbitrary mechanic thrown in for the sake of keeping the player busy.      Even if the puzzles and combat are a bit too easy, fans of Harry Potter will definitely enjoy the game's use of the license. The characters are all here and you'll have a chance this time to play as Hermione and Ron as well as Harry. They each have their own spell affinities so their individual sequences will seem consistent. Ron uses Carpe Refractum to lasso his way across vast chasms, while Hermione relies more on the statue-animating spells. In addition to the other characters like Dumbledore and Hagrid, the game also offers you a chance to get better acquainted with the school itself. The highlight here is the moving staircase that leads you from one floor to another. There's a map this time around, showing you all the floors of the school. Unfortunately, the lack of labels makes it decidedly useless when you're actually looking for a specific location.  Balanced against this authenticity is the complete absence of Quidditch in the game. Since it's such a signature event within the Potter universe, the fact that the third-year Quidditch action is limited to a short cutscene is plenty disappointing. Still, since EA has a separate Quidditch-themed game to push, it makes at least some sense that they've totally left that bit out of this game.  The graphics for the series have improved but they're still a bit inconsistent. While the three main player characters are generally well-rendered, the rest of the staff at Hogwarts seems to be suffering from some sort of low-polygon infection. Spell effects are generally nice but you'll be seeing them so frequently (there are only ten spells in the game and you use the same ones again and again in each challenge) that the impression starts to wear thin. Hogwarts is done quite well, with interesting architecture and some impressive textures.  I like the game's sound. The voice actors handle their roles quite well, even in comparison with the actors in the films. The soundalikes are generally believable, particularly for the three kids. Though the dialogue can get a bit cheesy at times, the acting makes it work. Effects are a bit monotonous -- most impacts sound like someone dropping a side of beef, for instance. Still the ambient sounds are pleasant and add to the ambience particularly in the few outdoor sequences. The score is Hoolywood-esque and quite well done. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Fharrypotter_060904_012_1086832296-000.jpg&caption=Let's face it; though the books and films have been enjoyed by adults and kids alike, Harry's PC games have definitely skewed towards a younger audience and this latest is no exception. And while the gameplay might be enjoyable for those who love the series, without that crucial Potter brand the game will inspire little more than indifference among the vast majority of gamers. The fact that the game actually requires you to backtrack through certain areas to collect all the cards and beans you can find merely indicates that the developers hoped to prolong the experience of playing without necessarily have to worry about adding new content.As I said, people who like the books or the movie will like the game, but only to the extent that they can appreciate the franchise. Those who are hoping for a challenging (or at least interesting) game would do well to look elsewhere.", "date": "Jun 10, 2004"}
