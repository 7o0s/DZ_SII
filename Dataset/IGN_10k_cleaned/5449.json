But that blaster, Star Trek: The Birds of Prey, was just a single course in the smorgasbord of ~Star Trek~ games planned by Jumbuck. Their newest game, Star Trek: The Cold Enemy, switches gear though. It's still something of a shooter, but it takes you out of the Enterprise cockpit and drops you into a more traditional side-scrolling action game.   And it even stars Scotty.   That's right, you don't slip into Kirk's boots in Star Trek: The Cold Enemy. The usual hero of any ~Trek~ game is jettisoned in favor of the ship's very capable engineer, the Scotsman who charms wonders out of the vessels with his brogue-tongued ~She can't take much more, Captain!~    Choosing Scotty to play the lead is a very clever choice for Jumbuck, but unfortunately, it's the only decision that dares take a step outside the box of conventional action-platformer design. The game is a six-level run-jump-shoot affair that pitts Scotty against a legion of Klingon warriors. Apparently the rowdy aliens have captured the Enterprise while in orbit above the mysterious planet Psi 20. On the surface, Kirk and crew have been taken hostage. Scotty must fight his way out of the Enterprise and reach the surface, where he must ventilate the Klingon marauders and rescue his randy Captain.   Where Star Trek: The Cold Enemy stumbles is control. For a game that requires some sensitive jumping and fast shootin', Star Trek: The Cold Enemy has loose, unresponsive controls. For example, you must often duck beneath laser blasts, then pop up to shoot, but it's too easy to accidentally jump instead of stand from a ducking position, and you often find yourself landing right on top of a laser blast.   Another frustration is your enemies' rate of fire. These foes have itchy trigger fingers, and are not afraid to unleash violent volleys of deadly force. Since you have to duck to avoid most fire, you rarely have a chance to stand up and fire before ducking back down. As soon as you do manage to stand and fire, you have to quickly fire then duck, and usually, by this time, your target has ducked, too. It seems the majority of most shootouts, at least those on flat terrain, happen on your knees. On uneven surfaces, you can use the terrain to your advantage and fire without constantly having to duck down.   One of the things we loved about Star Trek: The Birds of Prey was Jumbuck's incredible attention to detail. They really want to appeal to the franchise's considerable fan base, as their respect and understanding of the license really shines. Like their previous game, Star Trek: The Cold Enemy has some solid production values. Scotty really looks like Scotty. The Klingons are instantly recognizable. The sound effects sound right out of the classic series. Jumbuck should really be commended for showing such an intense desire to please fans.As much as I appreciate all the work that went into the presentation -- the art work, the sound effects, the packaging -- I just wish there was more to this game than rote side-scrolling antics. But even if Star Trek: The Cold Enemy was resigned to being only a side-scroller, it doesn't show the tight control and polished fun of The Brids of Prey. This is definitely a secondary effort on that front, and I was definitely let down.As I mentioned last week with my review of Fight Club, there really needs to be an effort to step up play values in 2005. Star Trek: The Cold Enemy certainly has the atmosphere and license use dialed in, but it's game play falls short. It's easy just to sign this off with ~but if you're a fan...~ but that's no longer fair. You may be a huge Trekkie, but your few bucks are just as green as a non-fan, and you deserve the best value for your money. Apply it to Star Trek: The Birds of Prey. But definitely keep an eye open for further Jumbuck ~Star Trek~ games, because the firm may hit another one out of the galaxy next time.", "date": "Jan 26, 2005"}
