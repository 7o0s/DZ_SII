In the second of the Star Ocean series, Star Ocean: The Second Story brings gamers the tried-and-true role-playing experience with several subtle twists and an endearing story that's bound to grip its audiences with the power of an epic novel. Comprising more than 40 hours of role-playing adventuring, Star Ocean: The Second Story brings together more than seven different characters whose stories all tie in to the Claude and Rena's own saga, as they uncover personal pasts and solve the larger issues of Arlia, Expel, and the Sorcery Globe.  Gameplay What drives every great RPG is the story, and in Star Ocean, the unwinding fates of its many characters immediately engrossed me. Actually, to take one step back, the early part of the game moved quite slowly. It was only after the relationship between Rena and Claude (or ~Mr. Claude~) began - specifically, when Rena found out about her mother -- that it seemed to get moving. But I was already hooked with Claude's bumbling move toward the transporter on Milocinia, and the after affect of the FMA had me in its trance. Later, as Rena and Claude grew more attached, I grew to love the game.  The characters are especially Japanese in their reactions. They're super respectful, and often don't say what they're really thinking. I liked this because you could read between the lines of the unsaid things. What Star Ocean does so well is to grab players and layer by layer, like an onion being peeled back, uncover Claude and Rena's adventure.   Having said that, my only complaint with the story is that sometimes the dialog isn't translated terribly well. There were times when I simply looked up and said, ~Huh? What does that mean?~ And I couldn't read between the lines at all. With a little more localization, Star Ocean's dialog would have been superb.   Adding to the overall story of either Rena or Claude (depending on whom you pick) are the set of mini-quests, or Private Actions, which pile on even deeper layers of gaming magic. After leaving a city or upon approaching one, players can choose to split up or stay together, by pressing Square, to venture off on their own or remain in a group. One such example is the meeting with Celine, which if you decide to heed her quest for treasure in a nearby cave, splits from the objective to solve the problems with the Sorcery Globe. The end result of Private Actions is their affect on your adventure. By changing your outcome, lead character, or something else, the game will slightly change. With 80-plus endings, Private Action quests only deepen your game. The only problem I can see is if you choose a mini-quest and then change your mind, or if you dislike the character you've chosen, you're stuck.  What I really liked about the interaction with characters is that they'll react differently depending on several aspects of your adventure. Initially they may say something generic, but after completing a quest, a little girl might, for instance, inform you of an area that needs visiting, or a man in a bar might suggest checking your skill development, a hint at learning new ways to grow. While typical, it shows the abundance of information to be gleaned by talking to everyone, again and again. The city dwelling characters all appeal to me, but even better are the characters who join your party.   Unlike other games, Enix chose to focus its attention on growing its characters, and didn't focus on environment interaction. In games such as Guardian's Crusade, everything -- bookshelves, pictures, beds, bedrooms, etc. -- were in some way explorable or at least gave a written response. I miss that here. When you enter an area, the item chests are totally obvious, and if they're not of importance, they remain static.   Although most gamers will be too engrossed to notice, Star Ocean's storytelling takes a long time. It's often like talking to a really old man, who pauses in between each word. The overall pace is really slow, and the overall amount of hours would probably have been cut down if characters spoke a little faster. There are a lot of conversations with about five to 10 seconds in which a little conversation bubble pops up and reads ~...~ with each dot appearing each second. Man, that's slow. The flip side if that it's simply just part of the story, which makes Star Ocean more realistic. In my mind, it's a double-edged sword, because the pace helped to create a mood, while others times, I felt that I was completely stuck listening to come curmudgeon seize upon by inability to get the heck away from him.  Innovation What makes Star Ocean so cool is its highly modified Item Creation. It's freaky, and it's definitely the greatest aspect of the game. By picking up gold lumps, silver or iron, or even food, players can later burn them down to create something new, almost always surprising. This is just an awesome aspect to Star Ocean, which kept me fiddling for way too long (and probably kept this review from going up earlier). You can create new foods, which might help you gain enormous strength, or create weapons or even recovery items. Your choice in skills affects the outcome of these processes.   The fighting sequences, while not polygonal, are fantastic and in realtime. At the beginning of the game, players can pick from Standard, Semi-active, or Full-Active fighting modes. I started with Standard, which is somewhat more staid, and then changed it in Options to Full Active. With Full Active, players can move away from the crowd and decoy enemies, or protect magic users. It's just another way in which Star Ocean shows its incredibly robust flexibility and customization.   Non-player characters fight with you, too, and often times their magic spells will finish off a fight. This is both expected, but sometimes annoying as hell, because it's all in realtime. You might go out to attack and someone from behind will yell ~Ray~ or ~Fairy~ and whollop the bad guys while you're in mid-action. And they do it often, so the giant explosions that were so enthralling in the beginning of the game become irritating in time.   With combos and Killer Moves, players can specialize even more so. Combos are just like what you'd expect, a combination of moves you've linked to pummel the enemy two or three times in one attack. And then there are the group attacks. Again, Star Ocean is strong in the ways of Customization. The biggest problem with fights is their chaotic manner. Explosions everywhere raining down upon everyone, all characters fighting on their own, and then the constant attention to the magic spells, which deter from what you're actually doing. It's certainly different than the turn-based battles, but it has its problems.  Graphics Star Ocean is a mixed bag of polarized graphics, ranging from really old-school sprite-based characters to a few brilliant FMV sequences. At the outset, the beginning Full-Motion Animation is just stunning. Stanley Kubrik would stand up and take notice of the emotionally charged mood the opening sequence creates. If you look really hard, it actually moves a little slowly, but the sense of ominous space and importance is delivered with near-perfect execution.   Transitioning from the brilliant rendered spaceships and colored galaxies, gamers will land sharply on their rumps as the tiny, pinky-tie sized, sprite-based characters dot the luscious prerendered backgrounds. For me, the transition was easy because so much excitement and wonder was stirred up by the opening movie. But I was also expecting a more spectacular set of characters. These guys could have been beamed straight from a Super NES RPG onto PlayStation, and not one pixel would be out of place. You couldn't even tell the difference. Sure, I was moved by their plights, but they're so tiny I'm surprised a mere seagull doesn't swoop down and eat them whole. They're like baby super, super-deformed characters. That in itself isn't a problem, and it didn't make me like them any less, but there are problems with this size. The characters are so small that unique, identifying details are lost. When you split up in town, Claude could walk straight by Rena and you wouldn't even recognize her! I couldn't even tell that Celine was a woman, or even a human when I first saw her. (I did eventually see the difference.) They're cute, even adorable, but nothing in the character design seems to use PlayStation's vast graphic capabilities to distinguish them. That's too bad.   On the other hand, the backgrounds are just short of amazing. Sure I've seen better, but the style is consistent with the rest of the game.  Deep caverns and vast jungles are brilliantly colored with luscious shades of green and blue. Water reflects perfectly in certain villages, and lots of detail help to develop a particular sense in each village. A flock or birds will fly by, for instance, or a castle is highly detailed with gargoyles and blanketed with fog. All of the environments are beautiful and interesting.     My gripe is with the difference between the introductory FMA and the spare times new FMA plays a part in telling the story. In almost all of them, you won't see any characters. You'll see towns getting swallowed or cannons and other weapons blazing, but you won't see the characters themselves. That's a small tragedy. Still, if you like FMA, there is something in the end that'll grab your interest.  Sound I'll be straight, I loved the music for Star Ocean. It's vast and epic in its reach, and the long, slow changes in tempo are perfect for an RPG of this kind. I liked the music so much that if there were a CD of it, I would listen to the music on its own. It's certainly not the kind of music you hum to, but it's sweeping and dramatic, and resembles a full symphony. The music is excellently reproduced.   On the other hand, the voices and sound reproduction of them are absolutely terrible. Even laughable. After a fight ends, each character will talk at the same time, making it difficult to hear what each ones says, but making matters worse, it's as if they interrupting one another. Second, The voices in this game are completely out of synch with the personalities of the characters themselves. They simply don't sound like the voices that should be coming from that character. Claude has this stark manly voice that seems so wrong for him, for instance. And the things they say are stupid, too, like, ~Not bad,~ or ~They were easy,~ or ~I did it!~ As if in real life, moving up to the next experience level was an ordinary thing.Despite the criticisms I have of it, I love Star Ocean. The little characters bugged me later in the game simply because I wanted to see them in full detail, and I guess that since the few FMAs in the game didn't feature them, I felt that they were never fully materialized. But what got me was the storyline, particularly the relationship between Rena and Claude. To me, the incidents that happen between them are funny and enjoyable, and helped me get past the occasionally slow pace. I love the innovation of the Item Creation, and particularly enjoyed the realtime battles. After playing through the turn-based battles in recent RPGs, it was a relief to play in this fashion. My final gripe is that there weren't enough save spots. There should have been just a few more.In the end, Star Ocean is a one-of-a-kind game. It's so full of optimization that's it's bound to be one of the classics for PlayStation. It stands out from the rest in several areas, the integral Item Creation, group spells, Custom Combinations, Individual Skills, and the many characters that can be played throughout. If you like old-school looking RPGs but want something new, Star Ocean is a quirky blend of both, with a great story to tell.", "date": "Jun 18, 1999"}
