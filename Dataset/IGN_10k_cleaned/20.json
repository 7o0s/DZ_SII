Here's what I was expecting from Army of Two. I was expecting a game with relatively innovative co-op mechanics. I was expecting solid, at times inspired gameplay, backed by a heavy dose of attitude. In fact, perhaps my biggest concern was that the game would be too obnoxious. That its loud-mouthed, wise-cracking private military corp protagonists would quickly get up my nose. That's certainly the impression I'd got from some of the early trailers.   Like I said, I was way off. Army of Two does indeed have some interesting ideas, and it was built from the ground up for co-op, but these mechanics are either shoehorned into irrelevance or just not executed well. And as for the forceful personality I was expecting aside from a little original-odd-couple dialogue and the odd air guitar moment (seriously), Army of Two is one of the blandest games I've played in some time. It simply has no personality  in the main characters, in the story, in the settings in the everything, really. That ain't a good foundation to be building on.       But let's take a step back. What's it all about? Well, on the surface Army of Two's setting would appear to be a treatise examining the increasing role of Private Military Companies (PMC) in modern conflict zones. Specifically, the real-world activities in Iraq of companies like Blackwater USA (in the game, you work for SSC, which merges with Black Mountain Industries  see what they did there?  to become the biggest PMC in the world). It's topical, true, but the use of a modern, real-world setting just makes the two-man-army-versus-the-terrorist-horde seem positively absurd and cartoonish  not a good thing if you're going to use the 911 attacks on New York as a story's jumping-off point. Why they didn't just set the game in the distant future we have no idea.   As it stands, we have two mercenaries  one who's just in it for the money and doesn't care about politics, and one who actually questions what's going on  getting paid to wade through Afghanistan, Iraq, China and a couple of other locations taking down Al Qaeda in a post-911 world. EA would have us believe that it's only through working together that the army of two will survive, and that's certainly true to an extent. The game features a mechanic known as Aggro  essentially a way for you or your partner to draw fire, thereby allowing the other person to flank largely unnoticed. Gaining Aggro is as simple as shooting at enemies; even blind fire will do. Get the enemies focused on you and your team mate can creep around to cap them in the back of the head. It's not a new mechanic per se, but Army of Two's metre does make the system nice and obvious. Unfortunately, the mechanic isn't as smooth or interesting as it could be in regular gameplay, thanks to the level design and cover mechanics (more on that in a minute), while the situations where you have to use it are heavily signposted. And you know what? Being the guy whose job it is to fire constantly at an armoured machine gun emplacement as a diversionary tactic while your squad mate works his way around, just isn't that much fun.   Army of three... oops, no, sorry - two.  Nonetheless, the Aggro system is very important in the game, and works smoothly in co-op. In fact, if you don't use it you'll spend a lot of time trying to shoot enemies hiding behind cover blind firing at you. And that ain't fun. Which brings us neatly to cover. Army of Two eschews a 'snap-to-cover' button in favour of a dynamic system. Sidle up to the edge of a wall and bring up your aiming reticule and your character will automatically pop out  or at least, it will look like he's popping out. Often you'll still shoot the wall, despite the reticule being trained on the enemy. Duck down behind a low ledge (or press Y to 'slide-to-cover') and you'll automatically be positioned to aim or blind fire over it. On the plus side, the system means that you can seamlessly step out from cover while still looking down the sight, but to be honest a proper cover system would have been a much better fit. Locking into cover and consciously choosing to leave it would definitely have made the gameplay feel more tactical, and reduced the frustration associated with just how quickly you can be knocked on your ass in this game... which then requires your partner to drag you to safety and administer some kind of multiple-gaping-bullet-wounds-healing shot.   The cover system is compounded by a number of quite clunky mechanics. Switching weapons, for instance, requires you to hold the left bumper to bring up a menu, then to hit a direction on the D-pad. Given that you can only switch between four things  primary weapon, secondary weapon, sniper rifle and grenades, it's a real pain going through this system, as opposed to  oh, I don't know  just cycling through with a single button. The amount of time it takes to switch to grenades, throw one, then switch back is just ridiculous. These guys are meant to be trained killers  shouldn't it be as streamlined as possible? Another clunky mechanic is the Overkill system: if you hold Aggro for long enough you can enter into Overkill, which ~greatly enhances your skills~. It's completely redundant. The game by its nature is largely shooting at enemies behind cover, so briefly entering into a pseudo-slow-mo mode where you're more powerful is irrelevant because the situations where enemies are actually running at you en masse are few and far between. Sure, there's the odd suicide bomber in Afghanistan (CRINGE) but they're not hard to take down. Simply put, you never get into a rhythm of trying to use the ability simply because it's more hindrance than help.    Moving on to the next thing that falls down in Army of Two. AI. Oh man. The enemies in this game are yet another example of 'intelligent' AI that just moves about for the sake of it  not for strategic reasons. These guys will run to a position parallel to you for no apparent reason. Hell, they'll even jump up onto a low wall right in front of you but they won't move away from a grenade that lands at their feet. About the only intelligent thing they'll do is blind fire from cover, forcing you to flank. And that's not as satisfying as it sounds.    The team mate AI  for when you're not playing with a friend  isn't great either. You can muddle your way through, but you're never going to rely on the guy or trust that he'll, y'know, shoot the bad guys. That said, the team commands work pretty well. It's a simple matter to get your buddy to regroup, advance and hold position. It would have been great to actually direct him, a la Rainbow Six: Vegas, but you'll generally be able to manoeuvre him into a position to take Aggro and allow you to flank. Still, this game is really all about playing with a friend, and that's definitely when it's at its best. Sadly though, Army of Two's best really isn't good enough.     But what about the much vaunted co-op abilities I hear you cry! What about giving your buddy a lift up to a higher level? What about going back-to-back to take on waves of enemies? Guess what  you can only do that stuff when the game tells you to. Switch to your virtual reality GPS for instance  the one that maps out exactly where you need to go and what you should interact with (no working out what to do for you!)  and you'll occasionally see the walk-here line scale a wall. That's a wall you can boost your buddy up! Anywhere else, uh uh. The whole back-to-back thing is more successful  throwing enemies at you in all directions and running the scene in slow motion. It's a decent-ish change of pace even though it's not something you can choose to enter into. Besides, during regular gameplay you can pair up at certain times. If you pick up a riot shield or wrench a (flashing) door off a car you can both crouch behind them  one person controlling the shield, the other taking out enemies. That's pretty cool, and shifts up the normal rhythm of the game.   What else, what else? Being in this for the filthy lucre you're able to visit weapons dealers during the course of the game to spend your cash. Buying new weapons is cool, but we have to say the upgrade system is just far too tame. You really can't do much. Oh, one thing you can do though  and I sincerely wish that this was a joke  is to 'pimp' your guns. Seriously. Have you ever seen a gold AK with diamond studs? You don't want to. Memo to EA  pimping your guns is lame. About as lame as beefy mercenaries doing air guitar and going ~widdly-wow!~. Sigh.   I mentioned earlier that the game has little in the way of personality, and this is especially clear in the environments  we've never seen decrepit, half-destroyed landscapes look quite so sterile. Technically the game looks quite good, but there's just something missing  something beyond an almost complete absence of interactivity. This sense of something being missing carries through to other aspects too. There are often huge jolts between locations  you'll be thrown into the middle of a firefight in a completely different place after a loading screen for instance, or pulled out of a mission after completing an objective even though you're still shooting it out. It's hugely disjointed, and while the story does kick in after the first mission, the opening to the game is very poorly handled. Why am I in Somalia taking out some warlord? Who are these people? Why should I care?   So decrepit, yet so sterile. How did they do it? Army of Two really doesnt get much right. The concepts that we were most excited about turned out to be all glitz, no substance, while even the core elements  the settings, the level design, the basic act of shooting your fellow man, left us cold. Not only that, but the dev team has taken a short game and stretched it to breaking point. I believe artificially protracted shoot-outs is the expression Im looking for. Youre either trying to take out some guy hiding behind a sandbag a hundred metres away or the game is throwing wave after wave of enemies at you. Either way its dull. Its also worth reiterating again that co-op is really the only way to play this game  whether online or splitscreen. The game may not have many redeeming features, but at least with a friend you can laugh together at the AI or attempt to make your own fun. Army of Two isn't terrible, but we're hard pressed to find a decent reason to recommend it.", "date": "Mar 13, 2008"}
