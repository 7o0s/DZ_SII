Well, stick Evel Knievel in your Game Boy system, because you're in for one horrific, unplayable ride...but at least it'll impress you with its stunning visuals. Features Four worlds Twenty levels Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Evel Knievel is a game where it's you against the stunts. In each of the game's 20 levels, you'll be challenged to get your bike from the beginning to the end completely intact without a single screw-up. With a little control, you'll jump and flip your bike over hills and bumps, riding upside down in looping slopes. But one screw up and it's back to the beginning of the level.  Technically, Evel Knievel is amazing. There's only you and the track, but the amount of frames of animation given to the cycle is stunning -- as the bike flips around, each conceivable angle has been rendered. It's almost as if the game has a rotation algorithm for the bike, something that's processor intensive if it's not built into the chipset -- and it's not something the Game Boy can easily do. The bike even has a little ~give~ when it lands on the pavement, simulating the fact that the wheels move independently from the chassis. The physics of the bike going over jumps and hills really provide a feeling of weight and substance. And even though it's not a Game Boy Color exclusive title, the graphics of the track and backgrounds are very well put together and vivid. If anything, the game looks really, really good.  But then, you actually start playing the game and you realize how unplayable Evel Knievel is. The message here is, being a daredevil is nothing but absolute grief -- you'll spend 99% of your time on the ~Bad Luck~ (crash and burn) screen, since anytime you bump your head on an obstacle, you have to start over. Your bike is dependent on the angle of obstacles, and most of the time you'll be flipping upside down because you'll find yourself going faster than the recommended two miles per hour. And momentum in this game is bad, since you really have no advance knowledge of what's coming up -- other than a useless map at the bottom corner of the screen that doesn't show your bike in relation to the land you're on.    It looks like the design team spend absolutely no time on helping you through the high learning curve -- right from the get-go, the very first available level (Las Vegas) and the very first stunt track (Casino Cashpoint) causes you to hit your head just after the first drop-off point. And when you hit your head, no matter how slow or fast you're going, the level restarts. How obnoxious is that?  What's worse is the corner-cutting that went on with the game manual. Like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto Game Boy release, Evel Knievel has a two page manual (more like a pamphlet) that tells you absolutely nothing about what you're supposed to do or how you're supposed to do it. What the heck's that all about?  I really want to smack around the person who green-lighted this game for publishing. I would not say this game is playable by any sense of the word -- did this game get any playtesting? Surely there must have been a few folk that might have mentioned the sheer impossible nature of the gameplay in Evel Knievel. If the designers gave a little leeway to the collision of your driver's head, the game would probably be tons more fun. But as it stands, a great looking game is not good if you can't play it.", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
