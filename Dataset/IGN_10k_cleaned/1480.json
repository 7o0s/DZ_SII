{"name": "Runabout 2", "name_review": "Runabout 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/15/runabout-2", "text": "The original Runabout, which was released as Felony 11-79 here in the States, wasn't too bad for its time as it was one of the very few mission-based driving games on the system at the time of its released. However, now that we've seen Driver and the genre is a bit more crowded and matured, the game's sequel, aptly named Runabout 2, just doesn't have enough improvements to make it a worthwhile title to own or even play for that matter.   Gameplay  While there are improvements over the original, which was an enjoyable title for its time, these upgrades to the game are quite minimal and none of them are really important where it counts -- in the area of gameplay. Runabout 2 is basically the first game with different missions and more cars. The missions are fairly generic and are quite tame in comparison to other games that are currently in the mission-based driving genre.   Most missions have the player try to race from point A to point B under an allotted amount of time while doing things like picking up booty along the way. While this seems all fine and dandy, it's quite limited in depth as the other cars onscreen are pretty much there just to get in your way and picking up goods and getting by police basically requires you to hit cars to collect goods and avoid hitting cops (or just crash into them -- although it costs you valuable time) to get past them.   The game's premise of accomplishing different tasks to complete a mission usually ends up turning into a simple chore of finding out how to get from the beginning to the end of the level as fast as possible, with the only thinking coming in the form of figuring out shortcuts, which aren't really that well hidden. The game doesn't have large city environments and it just sucks in comparison to games like GT Interactive's Driver.   Graphics  Just as the gameplay has only seen some slight improvements over that of the game's predecessor, the same can be said of the visuals. Runabout 2's graphics are only a minor improvement over that of the first game, which was first released over two years ago for the PlayStation. Seeing that the system has really come a long way since then, the improvements just don't really make the grade.   The framerate is decent enough, but the textures are uninspiring and a bit ugly, the car models are completely lackluster, a bit too blocky and very dated, and the backgrounds offer very little in ways of visual splendor. There's quite a bit of pop-up and other graphical glitches like seaming, clipping and warping polygons.   Sound  The only area where the game doesn't completely suck is its sounds. But, it's not good here, either. The music is generally okay to listen to, but it's never really good and the sound effects aren't what we've grown accustomed to in driving games now that we've heard stuff like what we've been given in games like Gran Turismo 2. The general feeling that I get from this game is low budget and it really shows in its audio.  Having actually enjoyed the first game, I was actually looking forward to playing Runabout 2. But after just the very first mission, but excitement for the game quickly diminished and playing the game became a test of my willpower to play through its dreadfully boring 13 missions. The game's style, graphics and design might have been passable when the first game was released over two years ago, but it just doesn't cut it now that we've seen much more advanced games in the genre. The warning at the game's boot-up suggests that the driving and action contained in this game occur in a fictitious environment and that you shouldn't try it yourself. I suggest that you just shouldn't try this game at home at all.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
