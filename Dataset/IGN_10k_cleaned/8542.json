Previous contemporaries like Super Star Soldier and Soldier Blade caught earlier attention, but Blazing Lazers is better than both.   Three things set Blazing Lazers apart from most other shooters: weaponry, difficulty, and history. The first of that list is the most readily obvious, as new gamers first turning on Blazing Lazers and jumping into its initial stage will likely be immediately confused at its robust but perplexing power-up system. Defeated enemies yield collectible orbs, a genre staple, but learning what each does can be tough. Here's a breakdown:           There are four categories of primary weapon in Blazing Lazers -- bullets, waves, lasers and rings. Each one of the four categories can be accessed by picking up orbs marked by Roman numerals. Bullets are I, waves are II and so on. Then, each of the four categories has five levels of power, activated by repeatedly picking up the same kind of power-up as each stage plays forward. Collect the right orbs in the right order and you can access powerful wave blasters that fill the screen with your firepower, heat-seeking, direction-changing laser blasts, rings that encase your entire ship and more.   But that's just the beginning. A whole other set of secondary weapon power-ups exists, and can equip your ship with force field shields, multiplying modules (like the ~options~ in Gradius), missiles and more. Only one type of secondary fire can be active at a time, though, so you have to pick and choose what weapons you'll need and when.   The whole system is complicated, but unique, making playing Blazing Lazers effectively a dance between the different choices in your arsenal and a game of avoidance, in trying not to touch the power-ups that you don't want to get. It's difficult to go too wrong, though, as you'll likely be able to succeed no matter what gun you're firing. That's the second aspect setting Blazing Lazers apart: difficulty.   Blazing Lazers isn't that hard. Not compared to the brutal challenge of many other shooters, at least, like Super Star Soldier. The later levels ramp up the madness to a considerable level, but the early going in Blazing Lazers is really pretty accessible and simple to blaze through.   The approachability of the design was likely a contributing factor to the third aspect: the game's history. History of popularity, to be specific, as Blazing Lazers was a fan favorite right from the start on the TurboGrafx. It predated Super Star Soldier and Soldier Blade on the system. It predated Gradius III on the SNES, and the R-Type games. Because it arrived in 1989, gamers of the day were blown away by its graphics and sound. It pushed the TG-16 to its limits, and early on. And it held up throughout the rest of that console's short life cycle as one of the most impressive games, both visually and aurally.Blazing Lazers may not have the power to dethrone Gradius III or R-Type III, but it still holds its own and is the best shooter ever for the TurboGrafx-16. Give it a look -- just be prepared to be confused at first at its perplexing path to powering up.", "date": "May 29, 2007"}
