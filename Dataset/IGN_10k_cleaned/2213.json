And it's a very popular thing to collect, since there's literally hundreds, if not thousands, of these tiny vehicles that you can pick up overseas. They even made the move to the states as Penny Racers, but they just aren't as popular in our market as it is over there. Like any hot license, Choro Q has been a series of racing games for years in Japan, but it's only been brought to the states a handful of times (as different names, of course).  Conspiracy Entertainment is the latest publisher to snag the Choro-Q game for the system, but don't blame them for the misbalanced feel and clumsy animation...Gadget Racers is an overall decent racing game for the Game Boy Advance, but it's a localized version of a somewhat sloppy Japanese development. Features Fifty vehicles 130 customized parts Forty tracks Mini games Battery save Link cable support for four players Only for Game Boy Advance Gadget Racers is the Pokemon of racing games for the GBA -- the task is to head out through the game's championship mode, winning challenges and earning vehicles by coming in first place. Every time you place first, second, or third in any given race, you'll earn a bit of cash which can be used to purchase better parts for your vehicle...and this is one of Gadget Racers better elements, as it actually forces you to build up on your vehicle by making certain tracks impossible to win without the needed car upgrades. For example, you'll need to buy dirt tires when the game starts going over the mud, or wet slicks when water enters the challenge...try to play these tracks without the needed parts, and you'll helplessly trail behind in fifth place.  The game has more than forty tracks, and while it's not one of the most difficult single player racing games to complete, it will take a handful of hours to play through.  The link cable focus is a definite plus, since gamers can ~bottle~ earned cars with messages and send them over to their friends who also have a copy of the game. Of course, players can race and battle each other, features that definitely bring up the game's replay value.  But on a technical scale, Gadget Racers slips a few gears with poor car animations, a sluggish 3D-style game engine, and very strange collision detection. Since the game features a total of fifty different cars that need to be rendered at several positions to give the appearance of 3D, the developers had to cut down on the amount of frames per vehicle...and this makes the cars look disconnected from the track when the camera flows around the cars at the beginning of the game. At the very least, this little presentation fluff should have been left on the cutting room floor so that gamers couldn't see just how weird the cars look with such few frames of animation. The developer also created a Mode 7-style engine for the 3D look, but it's probably the chunkiest one created so far on the system. Oh, it's still completely playable, but when you size this game up to the likes of F-Zero or Mario Kart, you can totally see that the programming isn't nearly as clean. Especially when the vehicles happen to smack into each other without really touching -- the collision detection is really wonky in Gadget Racers, since cars can ~bump~ from a vehicle's length away, or pass through them without any rhyme or reason.  Overall, Gadget Racers is a decent challenge for racing fans, but the development sloppiness is a little difficult to ignore...especially with other games like GT Advance and Krazy Racers performing the same technique with much better results. The game's charm comes from the collection aspect, its focus on upgrading, and its link cable support, so there's definitely some stuff to like about Gadget Racers...it's just a few notches below the other racers on the system.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
