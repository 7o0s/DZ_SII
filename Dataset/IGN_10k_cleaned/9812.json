As the system inevitably winds down, a few titles are still popping up here and there to grace the wizened console with a little more life, and NeoGeo Battle Coliseum is one such 2D fighter that's definitely a pleasant addition to the library. While perhaps not as enjoyable as King of Fighters XI, SNK Playmore's other recent fighter, Battle Coliseum, is a fun collection of characters to play around with -- especially with a friend.   NeoGeo Battle Coliseum pulls characters from a wide variety of different NeoGeo fighting franchises and throws them together to duke it out in tag-team battles. At the start of the game, you have over thirty characters to choose from with a handful to unlock. Once again, the expansive cast is a great highlight of Battle Coliseum and a good argument for buying it at only twenty dollars. Of course, there's more than just the character selection to consider, so let's get to it.    Battle Coliseum allows you to select two characters from the roster to fight against another team of two. All the battles play out in this manner, so anyone looking for one-on-one combat will be disappointed. The battle system is your typical 2D fighter with a wide range of Special Moves, Super Special Moves and even team attacks.   One great element of Battle Coliseum are the special team attacks (called Special Double Assaults) you can execute when you pair certain characters together, like Kyo and Iroi. These result in flashy, often times over-the-top sequences that totally pummel your opponent. Very satisfying indeed.   You have a few modes to choose from when you're ready to roll: Arcade Play, Tag Play, Survival Challenge and Practice (you can also face-off against a buddy in Arcade Vs.). One of the first problems that comes up when dealing with Battle Coliseum is the lack of modes. While it may seem like a normal assortment at first, Arcade Play and Tag Play are almost identical, only differing in how the battles play out. For example, in Arcade Play you only have to defeat one of your foes out of their team of two, but in Tag Play you must defeat both. Besides these details and a few other minor points, both modes are essentially providing the same experience, which feels a little repetitive. Survival Challenge is fun and helps you unlock a lot of content, but characters like Haohmaru can get by very easily (albeit cheaply) and make the mode way less challenging than it should be.   For the most part, the fighting mechanics in Battle Coliseum are responsive, fast and just as complex as other top-notch 2D fighters. However, we noticed (at least in comparison to King of Fighters XI) that certain Special Moves are very difficult to pull off. Whether this has something to do with short opportunity windows for command input or a lack of sensitivity for particular input is unclear, but certain Special Move combinations and dual-button presses were very aggravating. Moves that required three button presses at once were especially annoying to activate, even when trying to use three separate fingers as opposed to the broad edge of your thumb. These troubles may not bother skilled fighting game veterans who can compensate for the timing and sensitivity issues, but newcomers will be discouraged.   Poor Martian. He just wanted to be loved. Ultimately, the most disappointing aspect of Battle Coliseum, and the primary reason for our hesitation to recommend it over King of Fighters XI, is the lack of Special Double Assaults. Battle Coliseum clearly should have capitalized on this aspect of the gameplay, but the majority of the characters don't even have Special Double Assaults to use (over twenty of them are lacking in this department). We could understand if a few special characters didn't have partners to team up with, but having the majority of the roster lack a major technique seems plain silly.   Of course, we might just be overly fond of team attacks. We love our team attacks.   On a last note, be warned of occasional slow-down on certain stages. Even though all the characters are old sprites, certain levels will slow to a crawl for some reason, and that can really destroy the fun of a battle. You've been warned.NeoGeo Battle Coliseum is another fun 2D fighter for only twenty dollars, which makes it very appealing -- especially for fans of the NeoGeo franchises. Besides a few frustrating issues, the battle mechanics are tight and very rewarding, and the character roster is extremely impressive. However, with fewer modes and only two-character teams instead of three, we're hard pressed to place Battle Coliseum above King of Fighters XI. But if you want to have a dream match between two fighters from different backgrounds -- and try out new contenders Yuki and Ai -- Battle Coliseum is a pretty solid deal.", "date": "Jan 4, 2008"}
