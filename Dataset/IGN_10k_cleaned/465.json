{"name": "Zombie Revenge", "name_review": "Zombie Revenge (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/30/zombie-revenge-import", "text": "When it comes to video games, zombies are the perfect opponents. You can blow off their arms, legs, hell, even their heads  and they keep coming. You can't feel any remorse for taking their lives, because dammit, they're evil, and they'll eat your brain at the first chance they can get. You can't be diplomatic with zombies. You can't reason with 'em. Nope. The only thing you can do is blow their friggin' heads off.  Yes, zombies are cool. And so are games like Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil, and House of the Dead, which pitted you against relentless armies of the undead. Now, your buddy-buds at Sega AM3 have unleashed Zombie Revenge, a Dreamcast port of the arcade beat-em-up that dares to combine Streets of Rage with the Evil Dead. Zombie Revenge is a side-story in the House of the Dead universe, and takes place during the timeframe of HoTD 1. Woodside City has been infested with an army of shuffling zombies, and it's up to three people to go in and clean house. You can choose from three characters: the burly all-American ~Stick Brightring~ (no, that's not a typo), the curvaceous Linda Rotta (also not a typo), and the muscular Busujima Rikya, who is best described as a cross between Bruce Lee and Shaft.  From here on in, your job is to simple: find the source of the zombies, and kick its ass. Zombie Revenge takes you on a linear quest through ten or so stages, fraught with peril, danger, and really sexy special effects. Linda, Rikya, and ~Stick~ come prepared with both hand-to-hand fighting moves and weapons  you've been given a standard pistol from the get-go, so the stakes are in your favor. The way that gunplay is handled is relatively unique  a circular, 3D targeting reticule pops up over whoever you're trying to blast, and slowly turns from green to red. This corresponds to the amount of damage your shot will do, so keeping your distance and aiming carefully are to your advantage.  Of course, when you get mobbed by hordes of the undead, it's best to start busting out special moves with fists and feet of fury. Combos that include both hand-to-hand and weapon attacks can be strung together, and there are even grappling moves if you want to get up-close and personal with your zombie attackers.  If you've ever seen George Romero classic Dawn of the Dead, you know darn well that once a zombie bites you, you're a goner. The same holds true in Zombie Revenge -- after an enemy attack, your character is poisoned, and your life bar turns purple. The only way to avoid subsequent Zombification is to pick up the antidote, which can be obtained from fallen zombies. The fact that you're poisoned after every attack keeps the game tense, and if you're playing with a buddy, be ready to fight over who grabs the antidote.  It sure is pretty, though. Zombie Revenge never drops below 60fps, and the eye candy will rot your teeth. Per-pixel lighting, chrome mapping, true reflections, particle effects, and pseudo-specular highlighting are all used liberally, and the result is an unforgettable visual presentation. There are a ton of real-time cutscenes, which play in-between every level. And there's no trade-off in load times, either (which is good, since the ~Now Loading~ screen looks like it came off an Apple //e game). In short, it's a carbon copy of the arcade version, and that's not a bad thing at all. The only thing that's occasionally lacking is the animation  Soul Calibur raised the bar for motion design, and there are some odd-looking character movements every now and then.  Then you've got the sound. Good lord. While the music and sound effects are your standard B-grade horror movie fare, the voice acting actually beats Resident Evil in terms of god-awfulness. There is so much hideously executed dialogue in this game, I don't even know where to start. We've linked to a few sound files (in WAV format), so you can bask in unintentional hilarity. My favorite line is ~He's the one making the zombies. To catch him, we have to follow!~  Everyone . . . you say everyone is going to die? Evil, Evil laugh This one's funnier when you see what's going on. You especially must suffer. To catch him, we have to follow.    As we all know, a game that was fun in the arcade may not necessarily be suited for a home conversion, due to issues of length (just look at Dynamite Cop -- yuck). While Zombie Revenge is longer than Sega's other arcade titles, that's not saying much. Worst of all, Sega included the option for Free Play from the get-go  a feature that sucks a good deal of fun out of the game. This means a lot of players will just set the game to unlimited credits, and blow through the whole experience in about an hour. Come on, guys  this should have been a feature that unlocked itself after you beat the game fair and square.  Still, there are handful of new gameplay modes that may keep things interesting for awhile, including: Gun Mode: Bullets do a fantastic amount of damage, and new items appear. Insultingly easy. Bare Knuckle Mode: Hand-to-hand combat is more powerful, and ammo is limited. A good deal more difficult. Boss Attack: Forces you to dispatch one of the big guys as quickly as possible. Kill 'em quick for big points. Fighting Mode: A mediocre one-on-one fighting game that looks like it was slapped together in a week. We would have preferred a three-player simultaneous rumble, with all the game's zombies as playable characters. Ah well.  All right  so most of the new modes are kinda lame. But the big draw is that special objects are accessible in these games, which can be downloaded into your VMU. That's right  there's full support for our beloved little dot-matrix doohickey. When you enter Training Mode, you can download a 110-block mini-game for zombie action on the go! There are four modes accessible through the VMU: Food Mode: Use items you've picked up in Bare Knuckle and Gun Mode to increase your health and battle efficiency. Zombie Fishing: Select a level and a fishing location, then follow the on-screen prompts to catch a ~big one.~ Bordering on lame, but it has the same freaky appeal of Get Bass, so we'll let it slide. Zombie Doubt: A nearly incomprehensible guessing game, where the characters hold up signs with symbols on them. Nobody I've talked to has been able to decipher this one yet. Barometer: Gives you full stats on your character, including attack, defense, and experience.  While these new modes still can't top the brilliance of Chao-raising in Sonic Adventure, they aren't too shabby, and add justification to the game's price tag. We'll hope and pray that Sega includes this style of VMS ~enhancement~ in other arcade ports.  So, when all is said and done, is there an reason to import Zombie Revenge? If you can't wait until the US release in February, go ahead  it's a fantastic action title, if you can overcome the longevity issues. The game looks great, plays well, and has plenty of sick touches (just wait until you nail a zombie with the power drill). But just like a roller coaster, the fun is over all too quickly, and you may quickly find yourself waiting in line for something else. Nice job, Sega, but it's time to start beefing up these home ports just a little more.  -- Colin ~Stick~ Williamson", "date": "Nov 30, 1999"}
