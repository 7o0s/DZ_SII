I've just scrapped the first attempt at an introduction to this review after discovering that both Picross and Sudoku are actually a whole lot older than I thought they were. Both games were invented in Japan in the mid-late 80s and have been popular ever since, and Nintendo has even released a whole host of Picross games from the mid-90s onwards (almost all of which were Japan-only). So yeah, egg, face, etc. Not that you're ever going to see what I originally wrote, but essentially this is the first time I've come across Picross, and along with most of the Western world, Sudoku only came to my attention as the craze steadily built over the last few years.   Now, this could be due to a number of things. Blithe ignorance on my part, a reflection of the fact that I tend to think that people who read the paper are a little fruity, or the simple truth that I generally like my puzzle games to involve falling blocks, but the point is that the time is now ripe for a whole new audience to discover games like Picross. The sheer popularity of Sudoku, and the fact that Nintendo has helped create a new generation of gamers with the Nintendo DS, means there's no better time to bring this Japanese puzzle stalwart over to our shores. And we're really glad Nintendo has.     While Picross is quite different from Sudoku, Sudoku is nonetheless a good starting point for any discussion of Picross, thanks to superficial similarities. Picross also utilises a grid format, it can also be scaled in size and difficulty, and it also features gameplay that is all about rigorous use of logic - and at the higher difficulty levels, a little trial and error. And best of all, the fact that we think Picross is a better puzzle game allows us to call it Sudoku II: Electric Boogaloo.   Okay, so I'm not exactly making it sound exciting. I can't believe I actually used the words ~rigorous use of logic~. Point is, this is a fantastically well designed and addictive puzzle game. It's certainly far more contemplative than your average falling block puzzler, and the graphics are purely functional, but in the gameplay stakes, this game beats out almost all comers.   Second introduction out of the way, it's time to describe how it plays. Be warned, however, that the next couple of paragraphs could well see a repeat of the ~rigorous use of logic~ fiasco. Why? Simply because this is a slightly tricky game to describe without using strictly functional descriptions which brings with it the distinct possibility of sending you people to sleep. Oh well, here goes. The more basic Picross games give you an empty 10x10 grid, and tasks the player with filling in and crossing off the squares in the grid to form a rudimentary pixel 'picture' (hence the name). At the end of each of the rows on the left and each of the columns at the top, are one or more numbers. Let's say a row says '1 3 4'. This indicates that you need to fill in one square, followed by three squares, then four squares - in that order. Each set of squares you fill in must be separated by at least one space, and just as squares can be filled in using the stylus, spaces can be crossed out. Logically then, you know that the only solution for the ten tiles in the row is to fill in the first tile, cross off a space, then fill in three in a row, cross off a space, then fill in the last four. Another row may say '10' which means that you fill in all the squares, or '0', cross 'em all off. Anyway, as you gradually fill in more of the grid you're able to work out where to fill in the rows and columns that give you less clues.     So far so simple, and after you've worked through a few 10x10 grids you can then move up to the more challenging 15x15 arrays, and the gameplay evolves accordingly. The higher the difficulty of the challenge, the less useful information you're given and the more you need to logically (there's that word again) deduce which tiles to fill in and which tiles to cross. For instance, say you have a 15x15 grid and one of the rows is labelled '10'. Logically you know that regardless of where the tiles actually sit in the final solution (anywhere from filling in the first ten squares on the left, to filling in the last ten squares on the right), the five tiles in the middle will always be filled in. So, while you can't complete the entire row, you can at least fill those in, which may in turn give you a clue for the five columns that now have a filled in square. The more you play and the harder the grids get, the more ways you learn to eke out precious fills and crosses on the board. God, this is SO dry! But it really is a great game so bear with me!     The other aspect of the game is time. You're trying to beat each puzzle in the fastest time you can. Not that you're rewarded for setting a certain time, but it's certainly gratifying to go back to earlier, easier puzzles and blitz your old time with your now-expert Picross eye. During the easy and normal levels, any time you try and fill in a square incorrectly, you're penalised two minutes, but in the puzzles in Free mode - which is the game's hard difficulty - you're not told if you filled in a square incorrectly, which can make unravelling a mistake relatively tricky towards the end of the puzzle. Thankfully, at any time in Free mode, you can enter into a 'Try it Out' mode which lets you test out where you think things go. Get it right and you can lock in the changes, get it wrong and you can go back to the array when you activated Try it Out.   The main mode is a meaty challenge that ramps up perfectly, with 135 puzzles across Easy, Normal and Free modes (plus a handful of bonus challenges). The interface works really well, letting you quickly select the type of interaction you want with the touch screen (fill in, cross off, move around, zoom out). In fact, the only real frustration is accidentally filling in a square when you wanted to cross it off. Damn you two minute penalty! The top screen, meanwhile, displays a zoomed out shot of the 'picture' you're creating, and once you've solved the puzzle you're rewarded by the picture springing into colour and maybe animating slightly. Thankfully, you're not playing the game for the pictures.     There are a few other modes to sink your teeth into as well - Daily Picross charges you with doing things like solving a sequence of puzzles as quickly as you can or finding mistakes in an almost completed puzzle. Like Brain Training, it tracks your proficiency over time. Then there's My Picross, where you can create your own puzzles and share them via Wi-Fi. Speaking of which, Wi-Fi also allows for battling with a friend, racing to see who can be the first to solve two puzzles. Best of all, however, even if you manage to get through all the puzzles on the cart, there are a whole host of classic Picross puzzles from previous games online, just waiting to be downloaded.Picross DS may not leap out of the screen to gouge your eyes out with its sheer visual brilliance  in fact, quite the opposite - but honestly, what does it matter with such compelling gameplay? And trust us  it really is compelling. While the styles of challenges available may not vary all that much, if youre a fan of any of the other great puzzle games available on DS  the likes of Meteos, Tetris DS, Siltherlink and Planet Puzzle League, youd do well to check this one out.", "date": "Jun 6, 2007"}
