To date, Radical Entertainment has produced a series of workmanlike, reality-based snowboarding games for THQ under the MTV Sports brand.  MTV Sports Snowboarding and its sequel, Pure Ride, both had their share of over-the-top elements, but they still took place on traditional ski runs with the traditional selection of pro riders.  No big surprises in either of those games.   Then, what happened was probably something like this.  Pure Ride goes gold, and everybody at Radical goes down to the bar to celebrate.  The whole team gets brilliantly wasted.  Meanwhile, back at THQ, the producers and execs are having a little party of their own, and so they're kinda goofed up when a bunch of vodka-soaked Radical designers come in with a crank call: ~Hey, for our next game, can we make this post-apocalyptic sci-fi rebel snowboarding game with this neo-Fascist redneck ski run and big puddles of radioactive goo?  And land mines?  Can we?  Can we?~  And their producer, under the influence of one Johnny Walker shot too many, says ~Green-light that sucker!~   And when everybody's hangover finally wears off, we've got Dark Summit.  Dark Summit is, I kid you not, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi rebel snowboarding game set on a neo-Fascist redneck ski run with big puddles of radioactive goo.  And land mines.  If nothing else, I offer it big points for originality.  It's definitely got its problems in other areas, and SSX Tricky is still sitting very comfortably atop the PlayStation 2 snowboarding heap, but this kind of wackiness doesn't deserve to go completely unrewarded.   Gameplay  The most immediately noticeable thing about Dark Summit's control is the relaxed influence of gravity.  Your rate of descent is more or less normal, but everything changes when you decide to ollie -- you take off and calmly soar for some distance, temporarily freed from the bounds of the earth.  Very floaty, this.  It's a mixed blessing in the context of  the rest of the controls and physics, because while it's very nice for getting across gaps, landing yourself on a rail neatly is a tricky affair when you have to sort of soar on over to it, rather than just hopping on.    Well, now that I think about it, maybe you won't notice the floating thing first.  Perhaps the task structure is more of a standout, unusual as it is.  Dark Summit is built out of several large runs, which you gradually work your way through.  Earn Lift Points in a run by performing tasks and you eventually get to ride a little higher up the mountain, atop which evidently lies the secret of the radioactive goo and the neo-Fascist redneck sheriff (who, incidentally, would have been right at home in an episode of Scooby-Doo -- I expect he's just the night watchman under a mask or something).   So what are the tasks?  There are plenty of them, scattered around the expansive, nonlinear runs.  Some are trick challenges -- perform X tricks within the time limit.  Others are racing challenges -- avoid threat A, catch up with goal B, and so on.  Still others are, for lack of a better term, platforming -- clear these gaps, ride these rails, crash into that picnic table over there.  As you work your way forward, more complex goals arise that combine a little bit of all of those.   These tasks are just fine as far as they go.  The game starts to have problems, however, with the way they're arranged and linked together.  The courses, as I say, are large and nonlinear, with many forks and crossing paths.  Each time you go down (it'll require several trips through a particular run to get the requisite quantity of Lift Points), you'll only encounter a few of the many task triggers.  This is just fine early on when there's plenty to do.  Towards the end of a stage, though, when you've got only a few Lift Points left to get, you'll be searching all over the run looking in vain for something worthwhile to do, frequently going down the hill three or four times without being given a task.    Some of the tasks could have used a little tuning, too.  The tasks that require you to do a series of tricks could have used a little list of the requirements, ticking them off as you do them.  It's annoying to be told to do nine different grabs and then forget which grab is the last one you've got left to do.  The game also has some wonky settings for gap clearance and rail detection, now and again.  It's possible to clear a gap that's vital to a task and not get any credit for it, depending on how you land.   But is the actual snowboarding itself well-done?  Well, I'd give Dark Summit the nod over Shaun Palmer in this department simply because the environments are so inventive.  It's a pretty basic challenge, sure, but there's something about slaloming through huge spiky land mines that appeals to me, heaven knows why.  Cruising through the runs, catching air and smashing stuff is given a fair amount of life by the variety and interactivity of the environments.  The trick control could still use some work, though.  Special tricks are very basic -- you just tap three buttons in succession and hope the animation spools out before you land -- and grab tricks interfere with the spinning and flipping commands.  Up and grab performs a nosegrab, but unless you're very deft, it also begins the forward flip animation (since spins and flips are on the D-pad), which will plant you face-first into the snow.   Graphics  The Xbox version of Dark Summit is obviously the favorite son here.  The PS2 version doesn't look bad, but it definitely lags behind, with weaker texture detail and a skippy framerate here and there.  That said, does this look good?  Sure, especially since the style of the game gives it a little kick ahead in some situations where technical failings might hold it back (like the bizarre look of the trail your board leaves, an issue that appears on the Xbox as well).  The character and background textures are still very good (no shame in the Xbox version looking better in that respect, after all), and the track design is excellent.   These tracks are ostensibly part of a commercial ski run, but given the amount of stuff scattered everywhere, the patrons must have to sign a release form that'd scare you silly.  All kinds of equipment, junk, and wreckage litter the courses, along with the aforementioned land mines and radioactive goo.  A surprising amount of this stuff animates and persists, too.  For example, if you crash through a bunch of crates, they'll shatter and leave fragments all over the snow (like the barrels in Dark Alliance).  Plow through a snowman and his tumbling body parts will coast down the run after you, eventually catching up if you happen to fall.  The first time you see this happening, I guarantee it'll crack you up.    The character animation has a few flaws here and there, though, especially in the handling of bails.  The animators don't seem to have had the time to do a wide variety of crashes -- for the most part, you just get the same tumbling animation while the character bounces all over the course.  More often than not, crashes are vastly exaggerated in comparison to the events which cause them.  It's a little disconcerting to graze the corner of a portable toilet and suddenly see your avatar hurtle down the course doing half a dozen face-forward somersaults.  Keep your feet, however, and things generally animate alright, if a little quickly in the case of the special tricks.  There's a wide variety of them, with a cool system for building your repertoire (secret tricks are scattered in hard-to-find corners of the runs), but they sure do play quickly.    Sound  For such a visually loud game, it sure sounds quiet.  Sometimes you have a dark techno soundtrack quietly playing, but large stretches of Dark Summit are accompanied only by the sounds you choose to make, be they the skid of board on rail.  It's an odd design decision, but then it's possible that the game could approach sensory overload with too heavy a soundtrack (typical snowboarding hyper-cheese techno or awful punk rock wouldn't be an attractive combination with all the garish colors).   The voices are, well, a bit of a push, depending on how you happen to take Dark Summit's thoroughly silly premise.  It is, as I say, very similar in concept and tone to an episode of Scooby-Doo, albeit with fewer giant hero sandwiches and a little more of the generic ~edge~ that you have to have in a snowboarding game these days.   I haven't gotten to the top of the mountain yet, but if I don't get to unmask the evil sheriff and find someone completely unexpected underneath, I'll be very disappointed.    Hm.  I feel as if my thoughts on Dark Summit are just a little bit scattered.  But then it's a scattered sort of game.  Like I say, how this concept came to life I have no idea, but then it takes a little extra to set yourself apart in the market these days.Dark Summit is certainly not without its flaws, but it's better to be flawed and eye-catching than flawed and boring.  As such, I can certainly recommend this one as a rental, to see how its unusual atmosphere and gameplay happen to take you.  Maybe you'll get as much of a kick out of those land mines as I did.", "date": "Nov 27, 2001"}
