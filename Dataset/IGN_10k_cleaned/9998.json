Is it the blood, the gore?  Perhaps it's the satisfaction of tapping a button to make a fist fly toward your opponent's face?  Whatever the scenario, fighters definitely rage with popularity. Everywhere you look there's someone asking when the next Tekken is coming out, or if you saw how much blood flew after you planted that perfect uppercut to your buddy's nads.  Kicking butt is fun, especially when you've got a great game to do the kicking.  The sad fact is that, more often than not, companies are uninspired when adding their own ~special touches~ to the favored genre. Lately it seems that if it's not a Tekken clone, it sure as hell won't get much attention from the gaming public. And in many cases, it's probably best that people don't get too familiar with a fairly large amount of them only because, simply put, they suck. And hard. Which, naturally, provides the question, ~Why is it that so many fighters today leave a thought in my mind worse than one of a toothless old woman taking a shower?~ Titus seems to have helped answer that question with Evil Zone, the latest addition to the group of games that leave a taste in my mouth about as delicious as urine-soaked socks.   Thanks to the wonder twin powers of Yuke's, and the all-holy creators of the heaven-sent Superman, it's quite safe to assume that Evil Zone has more than a few flaws. With boring combatants, a lack of an interesting story despite the obvious attempt to have one, and a cliche fighting system that's been overdone a million times, there's certainly not much to brag about.  Gameplay Like most other fighters, Evil Zone has a one-player game that fails to impress.  Despite that, Titus attempted to soup it up with an optional story mode, one that's much more of a waste of your time than anything else. As you play this, you're able to choose from one of the 10 characters, the same as the normal version to play through, except now you get, and I use the term so it's looser than a woman wandering New York at night, ~treated~ to cut-scenes before and at the end of every battle.   It's actually amusing to think that people spent time on putting them together!  The voice acting is so very terrible, and makes little sense at all whatsoever. And for some reason, the story mode is made to seem as if the character you are playing is hosting his or her own TV show.  That's right, kiddies! You too can pretend that your fighter is the star of his or her own television program!   As for how the game itself plays, it has a feel that you've both ~been there and done that~ a billion times over.  All you do is sit there and beat the crap out of each other, except in this case it's slightly different.  You only have one frickin' button to push!  That's right, all you have to do is push the triangle button in conjunction with a direction on your D-Pad, and some sort of anime attack goes off.  Now, this is just a guess, but don't most types of interactive entertainment require some sort of variety in how you control them to keep you interested?   Evil Zone was fun to play at several parts, and it would be a lie if anything otherwise was said, but for the most of it, Titus' game feels like a redone version of almost every other fighter currently in existence.  With more things to add insult rather than lean in its favor, the gameplay proves itself to be a severely lacking element, and could have easily done with some creative touches instead of relying on flashy graphics to cover up for an overdone battle system.  This goes all around for every mode included.  Whether you describe the game by analyzing its versus mode, its survival mode, its story mode, or otherwise, it can easily be concluded that Evil Zone has about as much long-lasting appeal as probing yourself in the behind with a vacuum cleaner and then pressing reverse.  Graphics Admittedly, the graphic look of Evil Zone is one of the few areas where I have little complaint.  With a total anime look, the characters are nicely constructed and look as if they might be somewhat intriguing, although gameplay proves otherwise.  With some interesting attacks and several nice-looking special effects, its appearance isn't absolutely atrocious, which is a terrible shame since pretty, dressed-up graphics deserve to be accompanied with immersive interaction.   With lasers, magic, abnormal physical attacks, mind above matter, and beyond, there always appears to be a steady frame rate in place.  Although that only means you're bored while everything runs smoothly, at least it flows with some level of grace!  Sound The music isn't exactly something to commend or throw the game down in the dirt over. Your basic kind of ~battling~ game fair, it's neither good nor bad; it's just pretty much there.  The sound, on the other hand, could have used some serious tweaking, especially the voice acting! Absolutely terrible, the characters speak as if they don't know a single thing about what they're saying, and my eyes leer over at the ~Story Mode~ when I say this. Mostly, they talk a lot. Too much in fact. Every single action is somehow attached to a ~hyyahhhh!~ ~ha-ha!~ or ~yaaaa!~ My favorite lines are ~Where are you?~ and ~I love my missile launching technique. Hmm hmm hmmm!~ What the hell is that all about?  That, and as the character's mouths move during the cut-scenes, the voices hardly match. In fact, after the voice samples end, the mouths continue to open and close.Through all my years playing games, I've had the pleasure of wasting numerous hours on several excellent brawlers. From Street Fighter to Smash Brothers, Tekken and beyond, I've had a good time beating the crap out of my friends and foes alike. Unfortunately, games like Evil Zone pop up and beg to be seen, although they rarely have anything to upgrade over the blockbusters that everyone else in the universe hears about. In Titus' case, Evil Zone left a great deal to be desired. Some nice graphics aside, most everything else has been done and done and done and overdone in every other fighting game out there. One could easily complain about there only being 10 characters, one button to push for an attack, poor lasting fun, a disgusting lack of variety, and so very much more, and just couldn't help myself from doing so.In the end, Evil Zone is not really aimed at anyone with a brain. Certainly, fighting fans won't like it, and casual gamers will be disappointed. Who's left? Poor, unsuspecting gamers. Our advice: Stay away from Evil Zone.", "date": "Jul 30, 1999"}
