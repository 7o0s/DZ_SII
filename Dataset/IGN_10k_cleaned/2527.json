The destroyer (DD to those in the know) is quick and agile with lots of firepower -- the perfect setup for some serious sim fun. The speed and firepower of the destroyer lend themselves to a wide variety of roles -- from ground support, escort, interception and patrol. But the classic image of the destroyer is as a sub hunter, patrolling the waters of the world in an effort to find and destroy the threats lurking under the sea.  If you think that sounds like fun, you might want to stop reading now. For the rest of you, Destroyer Command is an average sim that rarely rises above its disappointing lack of functionality. A failure to live up to even some of the current promises made about the game is hard to forgive and even harder to overlook. Still, the game's not without some positive qualities but you'll have to be patient and persistent to ferret them out.  Sharing much of Silent Hunter II's interface, Destroyer Command is surprisingly easy to pick up. The interface lets you approach the game as you'd like. Super hardcore types will want to manually adjust every single system from within the appropriate stations on board the destroyer. Setting firing solutions for torpedoes and determining depth charge detonation thresholds is actually fun. The sonar's less so but it's still well simulated. Luckily the AI will pick up the duties you chose to ignore.  If the interface has one problem, it's that it has far too many components. Now, I'm aware that this is a simulation and that accuracy is a big selling point. But there's very little reason to visit some of the stations. For convenience's sake all of the engine room controls are accessible via hotkey from anywhere on the boat. This makes the engine room screen little more than a novelty. But even if you get off on switching back and forth among the sonar, torpedo and engine areas of the ship, you'll find that it's hard to jump back and forth from one of these rooms to a given gunnery station. You default to a particular view and a particular gun when you select a gun type. The two or three seconds it takes to get oriented can cost you a lot -- especially when the Stukas are bearing down on you. This makes it a bit chancy to switch back to shooting down planes after visiting the damage control room.  You'll need at least a few of these stations to take on the wide range of duties available for the budding destroyer captain. From single ship engagements to large armadas, you'll be able to take part in battles of various sizes. But it's the variety that's the real selling point here. You'll have to intercept enemy transports, protect your own shipping lanes, provide support for large capital ships and even fire on enemy coast defenses in preparation for troop landings. For me, this is the one strength this title has over Silent Hunter 2. When you're stuck in a sub, there's only so much you can do to help the war effort. But in a destroyer, you'll have all kinds of different tasks in front of you.   What did you think of Destroyer Command?  The game comes with two campaigns, one each for the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. Each campaign puts you in charge of an American destroyer and comes with 20 missions spread across a variety of tasks and situations. Merchant ship escort in the morning, shore bombardment in the afternoon and sub hunting at night. There's plenty to do here but the individual missions within the campaign are fairly static and progress along the same path regardless of how often you play them or how successful you are in them individually. This makes things a bit too predictable but with over 40 missions, it's not such a big deal.  The same can be said of the handful of historical missions included in the game. They're fun and interesting exercises but they play virtually the same each time you come back. Knowing what's going to happen kills the fun just a bit. The mission generator might open up the replayability of the game somewhat but it too is fairly predictable and doesn't permit you to fine tune the force composition enough for my tastes. If you want to set up a specific engagement, you'll have to continue hoping that Ubi Soft releases an editor for the title.  It's worth noting that while the ship models themselves are fairly well done, the effects in the game are a mixed bag. The wave model is quite nice with a very convincing (if repetitive) motion and there are some slight irregularities along the horizons. Weather effects are toned down somewhat with a heavily overcast sky substituting for actual rain storms. The best effect is the smoke from the stacks as they trail behind your ships. I kind of liked the flame effects and the spouts from the depth charges until I got a chance to see them up close. The flame effects are still pretty decent but the fact that the depth charge spouts are visible through your ship model is more than a little implausible. A few other bugs (like an ocean that disappears in the morning) are present as well.      But the stars of the show are the ships and they're rendered quite well. Each is distinctive and very well textured. The turrets all animate correctly and the damage textures are well done. A handy ship viewer has been included so you can familiarize yourself with the silhouettes and profiles of the ships you'll encounter. The punch is that the viewer doesn't work at all and crashes the entire game every time you use it. There's already a fix for this (that just involves copying one file to another location) but it's really the sort of thing that ought to have been caught and fixed in testing.  A few other key details are missing from the ships themselves. I think it's long since time we stopped complaining that there are no crewmen on board any of these ships but since none of the carriers we've seen actually have planes on the deck seems a tad silly. The view from outside is hampered somewhat by a ratchety pan and an under-sensitive mouse control. Having to pick up the mouse three or four times just to look behind you is ridiculous. What? I can't adjust the sensitivity? That's okay, I guess; I can't rebind any of the hotkeys.  All this graphical power comes at a high price though and, like Silent Hunter 2, Destroyer Command requires quite a hefty system. Running on a 1.7MHz with a Radeon 8500 and 256MB of RAM I still experienced more choppiness than the San Francisco Bay in December. It might help if the team had decided to include support for 800x600 resolution. Otherwise all you have to choose from are the unsightly 640x480 and stuttering 1024x768 screen sizes.  A game like this deserves to live or die on the strength of its AI. This is the part where the doctors come into the waiting room and tell you they've done all they can do. You'd expect engagements with destroyers to be very fluid affairs with each side maneuvering for a position of supreme concentration against the enemy. Sadly, the AI routine in this game is built along a kamikaze mentality. The great fleets typically run straight at each other in a mad contest to see who's war department will have to write the most letters.  While you can take advantage of this to some extent there are other, more glaring, errors. For one thing, it seems as if enemy subs won't ever dive below 45'. I don't know if this is another new tactic or not but it certainly puts a lot of destroyers out of commission. As you approach the sub to drop depth charges, you'd expect them to dive and get out of the way. Instead, they simply wait for you to run into them and then you can all have a hearty laugh about it in the afterlife.  Ship collisions among members of your own fleet are even more unforgivable. When you're trying to keep two divisions of destroyers in motion around the flanks of your enemy cohesion and timing are key. And when all this is taking place amid a flotilla of slow moving merchant ships, it gets even tighter. But that's still no excuse for ships turning directly into you. A few other AI issues, such as launching torpedoes well beyond range or, better yet, into your own forces, will give you no end of frustration.  And so we come to the biggest disappointment of all: the lack of compatibility with Silent Hunter 2. This is just inexcusable, particularly because the feature is actually mentioned in the game's documentation. We knew before the game came out that this feature was likely to slip beyond the game's release and, sadly, it still hasn't surfaced. The basic destroyer-only multiplay options are a poor consolation. Occasionally you play a game whose problems confuse more than frustrate. In Destroyer Command you get both. The ideas behind the game are relatively solid but the actual construction of the game is woefully weak. There are far too many little errors for this to be enjoyable by all but the most fanatical elements of the community. And while I like good sims, I dislike missing functionality even more.I used to like SSI's simulations and I had hoped that Ultimation would be able to take up the mantle and continue the legacy. The sad fact is that Destroyer Command is a below average title that should've stayed in dry dock for a few more months. At the very least the title might have been delayed a few more weeks to iron out the most offensive and obvious bugs. With a few patches they may be back to speed but the AI problems need to be addressed before any serious fun can enter the picture. Don't let the dearth of submarine sims fool you into trying this one unless it's part of a ransom demand and then only if you really like the person who's being ransomed.", "date": "Mar 5, 2002"}
