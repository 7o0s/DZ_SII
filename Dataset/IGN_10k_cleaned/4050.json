Spawned in 1984 by a healthy dose of green ooze and two hardworking artists, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the Mutant Ninja Turtles started a nationwide craze. These rat educated turtles popularized words like ~cowabunga,~ ~radical,~ and ~totally tubular.~ Everything from animated series, toys, comics, and lunchboxes to live action movies possessed some form of Turtle power.   However, out of the slew of licensed memorabilia, the one product that stands out is (at least in my mind) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade. Countless hours and quarters were sucked into Dimension X thanks to the addictive power of this brawler. It's doubtful whether this arcade classic would hold the same level of appeal if it weren't TMNT, but the combination of fast paced action and turtle power had a magical hold on those who played it. Now that the turtles have been resurrected in cartoon form on Fox, it's no surprise that Konami has tried to recapture the arcade spirit with a whole new TMNT experience.    The Facts  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appearance on current consoles  Based off the new animated series  Play as any of the four turtles through six foot clan laden stages  Two player story mode co-op  Two player versus mode  Discover scrolls and find items that will unlock special attack moves and special effects  Interact with Splinter, Casey Jones, April O'Neal, Baxter Stockman and Shredder  Unlock character art from the animated show   Gameplay  From the moment you boot up TMNT, you'll notice that everything reeks of turtles, albeit the new series. As the intro plays, you're introduced to the four turtles, you hear their new anthem, and catch a glimpse of the cartoon's new art style. Jump into story mode, pick your favorite of the four turtles (no one has an advantage over the others), and watch as the story unfolds via cut scenes straight from the cartoon. Once the animated portion ends, you're dropped into a minimally animated in-game dialogue -- once you get through the wordy conversation, it's time to kick some shell. This is where your excitement peaks -- you're about to face legions of mousers and foot soldiers just so you can eventually fight your nemesis, Shredder -- then the game actually starts and your interest soon fades away.     Your turtle heroes, for all the ninjitsu Splinter has taught them, have a limited arsenal of moves. A basic attack, a sweeping attack (can drop surrounding enemies), and an upper cut are the extent of your punches and kicks, although you can combine button presses in various ways for different finishing moves. You also can carry shurikens, but they cause so little damage that they're really only useful for igniting barrels of flammable material. The turtles can't even perform jump attacks at first -- for some reason it requires their sensei, Splinter, to explain how to jump and then attack.   While most brawlers don't have an extensive moves list, TMNT has been turned into a very simple button masher. There are only so many variations and no one attack is really more powerful than the other, which means you can go through the entire game just hitting the basic the attack button.    You're able to get away with singular button mashing because the enemies aren't particularly challenging. As you move around a level, various groups of thugs or foot soldiers will magically appear in front of you. However, they're held back by an invisible force field until you actually engage them. Once released, they all rush towards you in an attempt to surround and kill you. While there is a variation in character design, whether they are thugs, foot soldiers, robots, or mousers, they all follow this same attack pattern. This makes for some rather uninteresting gameplay, because you don't have to alter your attacks for various enemies. Just mash away until you reach a boss, which suffer from very generic AI, and then button mash some more until you've defeated them.    In theory, the limitations of both the AI and your moves list should make TMNT an easy game. It's surprisingly difficult, but artificially so. Your turtle doesn't know the meaning of the word block, so if you're unfortunate enough to get surrounded by goons you'll get hurt badly. You can't stop incoming attacks and have to rely on dashing out of the way (which isn't too effective when there's no where to dash). Also, there's no way to break combos, so once a foot soldier has started unleashing a move, you're going to take the full brunt of it. If the foot happen to beat you so severely that you die (even at the boss), you'll have to play through the entire stage again (which is composed of at least five areas).    The stages themselves are also poorly designed. You're just moving through areas beating up thugs. Occasionally there is a falling object or slicing implement you need to dodge, but for the most part it's just walk and fight monotony.    Even cooperative play, which is almost always fun, isn't exciting. All the same problems that are found in the single player game still exist, except that the frustration is shared by two players (why there isn't four player co-op since there are four turtles is still a mystery).   TMNT is simply missing something. It's tedious, monotonous button mashing. There's little compelling reason to play through game -- the story is cobbled together, often times introducing characters for the sake of including them in the game than for presenting a coherent storyline. Without even a solid storyline to motivate gamers through the adventure, story mode is more a form of exotic torture than a meaningful way to spend your free time.   If you still hold a soft spot in your heart for TMNT after the playing the story mode, you can always check out the versus mode. Here, you can pick one of the turtles or a number of guest stars (like Casey Jones or the Turtlebot) to fight one on one. If there were some form of fighting engine attached to this game, it would have been kinda cool, but since it's the same button mashing tactics that are found in the story mode (you still can't block) it's a relatively pointless inclusion. There's also a challenge mode that let's you see how many enemies you can kill without dying, but it's basically playing the story mode without the story.   If you do happen to be a devoted enough fan to play through the entire game, there are a bunch of extras to be unlocked. There's character art, toys, weapons, equipment, Splinter and Casey modes, and unlockable characters for the versus mode. It's too bad that the actual game isn't all that fun to play, because there is some cool stuff for fans (although no inclusion of the NES classics).      Graphics  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great looking game. Taking a cue from the anime style of the new cartoon, TMNT is entirely cel-shaded. While the art doesn't even look like that cartoon, the general idea is there do to simple lines and bright colors. Each successful attack is accented by a visual ~thwock~ and overall it's just pretty to see in motion. However, it does suffer from repetitive level and character designs, a little more variety would have made it more impressive.    The cut scenes look exactly like the animated series and usually run quite smoothly. However, the style is so visibly different than the cel-shaded graphics that when they suddenly switch to the in-game graphics your eyes are jarred by the contrast. Of course, what's more disappointing is that the in-game cut scenes use minimal animation and the dialogue, instead of lip synching, uses word bubbles.     Sound  Even the sound gets repetitive. There's only so many times you can listen to Raphael say, ~Take that nimrod!~ or ~Now I'm Mad~ before it drives you crazy. It's so bad that you want to turn off the sound effects -- which if you're playing co-op are multiplied. All the turtles have a catch phrase that they repeat every other hit. Leonardo prefers, ~Slice and dice,~ Mike says, ~Mikesaurus Rex~ (which doesn't even make sense), and the all time favorite is Don's, ~Want to play stick ball? I have a stick... you be the ball.~ Canned one-liners wouldn't be too bad if there was other aural variation. Unfortunately there are only three or four different thwock, twack or crash sounds. Even the background music is looped and often and sounds like some form of Turtle inspired elevator music than something you'd want to be fighting to.   Fortunately, the cut scene voice acting is spot on -- most likely because they're using voice actors from the show. However, when they switch over to the in-game story scenes, the dialogue is not only stale, but it sounds forced -- which doesn't exactly get you excited to fight those foot soldiers one more time.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a game I want to love, but hate to play. I've been a TMNT nut since the original animated series -- I own all the figures, a slew of the comics, and even TMNT sheets. I was so excited for TMNT -- with my false hope that it would in someway capture the essence of the arcade title. The magic just isn't there.If it weren't TMNT, you wouldn't want to touch this game. It's a typical boring and repetitive brawler. You die cheaply, are forced to repeatedly play through unimaginative stages, and don't have a whole lot of fun in the process. In fact, playing through any part of the game is painful -- it's unlikely anyone will want to take the time to unlock everything or fully explore the versus and challenge modes. Even multiplayer is boring, those even interested in playing co-op quit on me after their first death. I'm not sure what happened, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is lacking in turtle power. It's like a bad peach, it looks tasty and sweet from the outside, but once you sink your teeth in you realize that it's just mush.", "date": "Oct 22, 2003"}
