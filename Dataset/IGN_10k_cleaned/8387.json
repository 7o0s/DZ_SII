Some of the best and most memorable gaming experiences over the past few decades have simply defied classification. Games like Katamari Damacy or Mr. Mosquito. Games that are just so ridiculously odd that you can't help but smile at the preposterousness of it all  Bravoman is one of them. This side-scrolling 2D fighter from the TurboGrafx is one of the weirdest and wackiest games of its day, and it's almost worth a download just to see how purely insane it really is.   Bravoman is a super-suited superhero, some kind of costumed avenger like the Power Rangers. In place of a Megazord, though, Bravo's gifted with a more extendable type of crime-fighting tech  his own stretching appendages. This game plays something like a Street Fighter 2 spin-off would, if Dhalsim were given the starring role. Bravoman attacks his enemies by stretching out his arms, his legs, and even his neck for limb-elongating action.        That would be enough weirdness in itself, but Bravoman's nonsense extends beyond the self-extending hero and touches the rest of the game as well. His world is a parodical take on modern Japan. His enemies are spinning, grinning totem poles, robots, and knife-throwing dancer girls. His arch-nemesis is a man named Dr. Bomb, whose hairstyle looks like something out of your local organic food store's cauliflower section.   Add on to all of this a heaping of classic poorly-translated Japanese dialogue, and the stage is set for a winning experience. Bravoman's gameplay capitalizes on the presentation, too. It's not revolutionary, but it is entertaining  you run and jump through side-scrolling levels, scoring points and eating rice balls to recover health. You can also collect ~Luck Symbols~ to redeem for power boosts with sidekick character Lottery Man at the end of certain stages.   And, mixing things up, Bravoman occasionally goes underwater, transforming himself into a submarine. These stages alter the gameplay into something more similar to a spaceship shooter like Gradius, and it's a nice change of pace when they appear.    The icing on this kooky cake comes in assaulting the help. When loyal, friendly characters appear on-screen to offer you aid, you can relentlessly punch or kick them without warning. They'll be insulted at the offense and verbally retaliate, threatening not to help you if you keep it up. And, if you keep it up, they'll make good on their threats  Lottery Man, for example, will stop supplying life-replenishing rice balls if you smack him around one time too many. It's an extra touch of detail that rounds out a wonderfully wacky adventure.The Wii's Virtual Console has previously seen a few other side-scrolling brawlers from the TurboGrafx, with Vigilante and Splatterhouse. Bravoman proves to be a good companion to these titles, as together they form a picture of what a staple genre of the TG-16 line-up was like back in the early '90s. Given the choice between the three, I'd likely give a slight nod to Bravo. But it's worth considering a download of any one of them to get a sense of that part of Hudson company history.", "date": "Apr 19, 2007"}
