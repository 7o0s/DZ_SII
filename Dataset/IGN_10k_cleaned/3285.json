{"name": "The Guild", "name_review": "Europa 1400", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/27/europa-1400", "text": "Let's be clear about this: I was the first person who said, ~There is nothing new under the sun,~ in an interview given to an inquisitive young scribe longer ago than I care to remember.  He subsequently got religion, and added it without giving credit to a best-seller called Ecclesiastes, after a popular techno group in Minneapolis, Babylon.  So you see, I really do have a special sort of authority in pointing out how seldom genuine originality appears.   And are games any different in this regard?  Let's ignore the hype and emotional appeals such as ~400 years in the making!!!~ and ~so much pulse-pounding action that your brains will flow out of your ears and into your pancake syrup!!!!~  Technical upgrades and feature crawl in a given genre are as common as a politician's promises, but how often do you really come across a game that is truly different from everything else?  Not often, and the company accountants will smile through their tight sphincters and tell you why: originality isn't financially feasible.  They advise against investing in it.   That's why I cherish those game developers that buck the trend to attempt something off the beaten-into-the-ground path, and manage it well, living to tell the tale; like Ion Storm, offering up a mix of RPG skills, graphical adventure backgrounds and first-person action in Deus Ex, and A-Sharp, whose King of Dragon Pass blends RPG goals and personalities with strategy micromanagement.  Neither game plays like anything else out there.  As much can be said for Europa 1400: The Guild.  It's not quite as focused a title as either of the other two I've mentioned and the learning curve is steep, but it offers an addictive experience that doesn't resemble any game on the market.   It's 6 AM.  Time for the Mid-Renaissance to Begin.  The game's nominal plot places you in your choice of one of five European cities in 1400 ACE, each rated for number of competing dynasties, available building plots, etc.  You select your goal in Europa 1400 from several dozen possibilities ranging from extremely easy ones that could take a couple of hours to achieve to very hard ones that could require thirty hours or more.  There's great variety in them, too, with everything from upgrading your business to destroying several thieves guilds, to becoming Grand Inquisitor, to marrying and divorcing a specific number of women at a time when the religious authorities frowned on any divorce at all.   Next, you choose your parents (alright! for once!) from groups of five men and four women representing different professions: trader, thief, priest, etc.  (Yes, I know priests were sworn to celibacy by this period in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, but these things happened.  If that's still a problem for you, just think of yourself as a miraculous birth.)  Each parent contributes a sort of skills-based DNA to the mix, affecting your final rating in five important areas: negotiation (sales and purchasing), handicraft (business performance), rhetoric (bribes, sermons, court cases, etc), stealth (kidnapping, espionage, etc) and combat (attacks, duels, raids, etc).  You then select one of eight professions.  (Four more are designated as advanced professions, and become available only after you've started a game.)  At that point you advance to the age of maturity, and begin the game with a basic guild diploma, small house and adequate starting business.   From this point forward, everything in your world centers around money and political advancement.  Which of these two is more important to you depends upon the goal you chose, but these two elements are really intertwined.  You can't move up the political tree if you don't have the financial resources to impress and control others; while reaching the top branches of government will certainly help you control the kind of legal environment you live within, and the ease with which you ruthlessly sweep aside the competition.  Think: Bill Gates appointed to the highest office of the land, and welcome to my nightmare.   Actually, I lied above.  (I'm sorry.)  There is one more important factor to consider, and that's family.  Europa 1400 runs in realtime, with a clock whose speed you can control.  (Having enough time to do everything you want never seems to be a problem.)  Once a twenty-four hour period passes, the game jumps ahead a year and a season, so that Spring 1420 moves to Summer 1421, etc.  No matter how skillful, rich and powerful your current persona becomes, eventually he or she will age and die.  Sorry, I know that unremittingly sucks, but you can compromise with the tall emaciated guy with the sickle by marrying and having kids.  This lets you name one of your offspring as your heir, passing along all your titles, wealth, and goods to them.   Your New Life  You begin with a home that has one room, the study.  I'm sure there are more around; after all, you don't see a or cupboard or chimney stove (standard Renaissance issue) in the place, much less a bed and a chamberpot.  What you do have, however, is a place that functions as the center for your social operations.  All of these options are accessed by clicking on hotspots, whose locations against the backdrop you can quickly find by pressing the CTRL key.  For example, clicking on a nearby window brings up a menu that lets you hire a spy to get the goods on another inhabitant; clicking on the desk lets you view any evidence that's already been collected.  You can gain further master grades in your profession (when available, to a total of six), and train in the handicraft and negotiation skills, as well.   Using social activities isn't generally free.  Most rely upon the expenditure of action points, which are acquired each turn, and can be stored for later use.  While you can purchase residential add-ons and items that increase your action points, the sheer number of available social activities dramatically increases once you've upgraded your house twice and added up to five more rooms.  Who can resist the temptations of blackmail, bribery, wooing the favor of highly placed officials and improving your three other personal skills?     Meanwhile, the other anchor of your daily life is the main room of your business.  For many professions it's a storeroom, though it can be anything from a chancery to a thieves' underground hideout.  (Oddly enough, though thieves work in a series of underground rooms, their hideout is accessible from the outdoors 3D screen as one regular house among many, complete with windows.  Obviously, a disguise.)  Whatever its appearance, this room and any of its attachments provide an area for gathering and processing resources, as well as the assignment of subordinates to their respective activities.  As your funds increase you'll want to consider making improvements both to the building's outside and the various rooms.  These work like research trees: finishing one or two improvements creates the opportunity to do a third, etc.  Just as with your house, you can upgrade your business twice, then extend it by adding new rooms.   Let's take an example straight from the career of an alchemist I grew, the reputable Jules Schicken.  Jules' shop began with a couple of apprentices who could hunt for herbs.  He could also send his cart to the marketplace or another business and purchase ingredients.  From these resources, the apprentices created three items: two finished goods, bombs and Endurance Potions (supplying two action points when consumed; limit, one per year) and paint, which could be sold like the other items or used as ingredient, itself.  Further upgrades to the structure offered him the opportunity to add several rooms.  These included a cellar, which in turn yielded more ingredients and the production of a new series of potions, such as Toad Slime (slip it onto the door of someone's residence, and they'll grow ill from its contact) and Dr. Faust's Elixir (extends life a few years).  Jules also spent a small fortune increasing his shelf space to accommodate both raw materials and finished products, as well as buying a second transportation cart.  He hired another couple of apprentices (who can be promoted after four years; it costs more money, but they're much more efficient) and purchased all the improvements that could be made to each room and to the shop as a whole.  These gave him productivity and yield bonuses, protected his employees from illness, and his whole business from likelihood of theft.  Not that he went theft-free, but at least several attempts were foiled by his efforts.  Crafty, crafty Jules.   Finally, our alchemist hero rose to the top of his profession, become fairly wealthy, and wanted to move onto something more challenging.  So he engaged a master (the AI) to run the business for him, gave him a large allowance, and bought out a storage shed to resume life as an international trader.  Now he could construct or purchase alchemist's shops, take care of all the initial expenditures himself, then spend most of his time working in his new firm.  Life was good, especially if you had an unlimited supply of Dr. Faust's Elixirs at your disposal.    Magic Galore  As the potions demonstrate, Europa 1400 really isn't about history.  The complexities of a society can't be reproduced in a game; and if they could, they wouldn't be any fun.  To speak bluntly, do you really want to experience what it's like for one of the Sims to drive through rush hour traffic to work, listen to countless salespeople before buying a kitchen table, and experience the joys of going through a day with hemorrhoids?  Life is like that, except that in the real year 1400 people worked closer to home, furniture was more solid, and people feared the Plague rather than the piles.   So 4Head Studios did a smart thing when they traded off any semblance of accuracy to period and place for a nice, broad brushstroke of romanticized color and a cholesterol-enriched helping of fantasy.  For example, you can purchase a Metaphysical Belt that gives a dramatic boost to the wearer's combat talent for three years, or a Tirade of Hatred that lets you turn two of your competitors into enemies of one another.  An expensive Lucky Stone increases the user's reputation with all state officials for a year, while a Spinning Top, given to one of your children, increases their handicraft talent.  I counted more than forty manufactured items that came from various businesses in town, on sale at different times depending upon high demand and pricing for the item.  Your pouch only holds six unique items at one time, though, adding an element of strategy to your purchase and use of objects.   The AI runs all your opponents, and does a very competent job selecting what resources to buy or gather, and what items to create.  It will also buy and use them, occasionally targeting you.  I found myself taken aback when a message appeared indicating that one of the competitors for a job as Town Servant had surprised me with her bewitching scent, a sure sign that she was using a magical item to gain my favor.  Did the AI honestly view me as another AI?  Leaving the metaphysical implications of that question to one side, I wasn't under any compulsion to act favorably towards anyone who used the latest thing in Renaissance perfumed aphrodisiacs.  The AI players were, but I remained a free agent, at least after taxes were paid.  If the developers had really wanted me to react to magical potions with emotional effects, they should have taken control away from me during the subsequent voting for political office.  Had I found my selection of Kateryn Slyfield as Town Clerk already made for me after getting a whiff of her, I would have accepted the game's reality, just as I accepted it when my character got physically ill after someone smeared Toad Slime on the door knob of his home.   Competition in the Big Time  Sooner or later, it happens, and I don't mean telemarketing phone calls or visits by suited teens anxious to pray with you.  No, I refer to getting involved with Europa 1400's bureaucratic establishment.  The game has a relatively extensive political model in place with thirty civic and six honorary offices.  The privileges that come with the nicer offices can make a big difference in your lifestyle, though it's a long climb to the top.   The Grand Inquisitor can engage in Cheap Malice, for instance, meaning that he only has to pay half the amount for espionage and any dirty actions (such as sabotage) undertaken in the back room of his residence.  He can also Beg Forgiveness: if caught in his crimes, he can invest as many action points as there are crimes and go completely free.  (The modern version of this technique is known as the Enron Wrist Slap.)  Got a character without combat skills, and afraid of physical force?  Aim for the post of Prefect.  He can permit or forbid dueling.  Sure, you still might get challenged, but at least you'd have the satisfaction of seeing your attacker heavily fined and sent to prison.  (And these weren't the kind of prisons they have for drug barons these days in Columbia, either.  Even the rats complained about the discomfort and lack of basic amenities.)  You'd also better check periodically at the Town Council building  to see what the current occupants of high offices have done to the laws.  You don't want to be caught by somebody else's spies doing something illegal, since the penalties can be pretty nasty if your foes are in power.   Not that you can simply avoid the malicious attention of other town occupants through good behavior.  In fact, you can be the most upstanding member of your community, a paragon of such incalculable virtue that you would cause Billy Graham to go work in a casino out of frustration; still, people will covet your money or fear your growing prosperity.  They'll blackmail you, waylay your goods, hire thugs to beat you up, and lampoon you to damage your reputation.  You'll be brought in on trumped up charges before courts, and receive exorbitant demands for protection money against each of your businesses.   The AI is reasonably good and, like the Simtex-developed games of old (Master of Orion II, Master of Magic), doesn't cheat.  Unlike Age of Wonders II, your opponents aren't gifted even at the lowest levels with more gold and stuff than you've got.  They play by the rules; and you'll observe over time how they enlarge their businesses, build new structures, send out their own carts and create more expensive goods.  As you grow wealthier and gain new opportunities to blacken the name of your opponents, so will they.  At higher levels of difficulty you simply start with a lot more people who are pissed with you.  But even if you're exceeding well-liked, your boots squishing with the milk of human kindness at every step, the AI-controlled inhabitants of your community are still going to engage in preemptive attacks against you as you rise in the pecking order.  It's just sensible business practices, sir.   That's why you'll want to get into a little preemptive activity of your own.  Assuming you've got a high combat skill, you can insult an opponent, and if he backs off from a duel, grin as his reputation crashes and burns.  You can spy on others, find out their guilty secrets, then bring charges before the courts; or threaten them, and if successful, cause them to temporarily lose the ability to use their own dirty tricks against you.  You've more motivation to act in this fashion when you're advancing a political career, of course.  Getting rid of competition for an important post or bribing a superior to like you better is all part of the game.    One Deep Game, This  I was impressed by the way Europa 1400 plays as four somewhat different experiences depending upon the profession you select: handicrafts (smithy, alchemist, joiner, stone mason), service-oriented (landlord, preacher), merchant (trader, moneylender) or military organization (thief, town watch, robber/mercenary).  Thus, blacksmiths hire relatively cheap apprentices whose skills improve only once when they rise in rank, while the thief spends a lot to acquire assistants whose combat and stealth skills he can train up slowly but powerfully in his hideaway.  Preachers sell some of their products, like indulgences, directly to select members of the public, while traders buy low abroad in order to import and sell high.  The challenges and opportunities are distinct.  As a robber, you can raid businesses; as the town watch, you can fight off raids, and have your guards patrol the streets.  Both sides can buy a variety of melee and long-range weapons, while robbers and thieves also can employ bombs.  During battle, you control your men through a standard click-and-move or click-and-attack mode.   The sheer variety of options available to your character as you advance (whether through money, action points, Council appointments or increased social rank) is huge, and I've only mentioned some of it above.  Do you want to gamble?  There's always a dice game running when the local tavern's open.  How about cheating in a duel?  It's possible, and it gives you an edge, but if you accept the option then the attending physician won't heal any wounds you acquire, afterwards.  Fancy yourself a taskmaster, or a sterling example to employers, everywhere?  You can adjust the pay rate and working conditions of your employees, even offering them a periodic bonus of whatever amount you want, if you so choose.  This is really a rich game.   It's only fair to note that while all the activities are great, their application in Europa 1400 has a rather pale, abstract feel.  While sabotage displays nicely as an explosion and fire that spreads on the 3D outdoors screen, the results of most other activities are only conveyed to you secondhand.  You never actually witness an insult hurled, a potion's effect, blackmail, bribery, etc.  When you get the goods on someone via espionage, there's nothing tangible; merely a statement on a menu that he or she committed a specific crime, like a kidnapping, or a thrashing, or a lampoon.  No details are provided, and there's no life to the accusations.   So How Does It Play?  There are a lot of interesting ideas on display in Europa 1400, and they arguably provide a unique experience to the veteran gamer.  Certainly no other strategy game, much less an RTS, has attempted to do anything quite like this before.  Implementation is less successful, however.  I found myself repeatedly wondering as I played whether the developers had ever bothered gathering a large, diverse group of beta-testers to provide adequate feedback.  Surely some of the decisions that affect gameplay (and that includes everything from graphics to interface) would never have been made if plenty of gamers had offered feedback with the benefit of their own experience.   Take the matter of game options.  The game is pretty dark indoors, and there are no brightness, contrast or gamma controls.  Cut scenes, usually played for special events like births, marriages, and deaths, can't be halted.  The first time through, they're annoying enough.  Repeated performances didn't warm up my personal welcome.    You also can't turn off Random Events, possibly the single biggest nuisance factor in the game.  I don't object to them as a matter of course.  In fact, random events lent an attractive sense of variety and color to that hallmark RPG, Microprose's Darklands, back in 1992.  You expected to encounter the occasional rapacious bishop or arrogant knight on the road, a bevy of wild boars in a forest, or sudden ambushes in the darker, seamier sections of large cities at night.  But the events were appropriate to location, which can't always be said for Europa:1400.  Don't get me wrong: I don't mind when my character is pickpocketed while his stealth value is low; but I shouldn't get a message that he was pickpocketed for 500 gold pieces (ridiculous enough in itself) while observing an execution, when he's been indoors at the storeroom the entire day.  The variety of random events in the game is small, too, but their incident rather high, leading to too much repetition.   The visuals are definitely a mixed bag, here.  Europa 1400 is a curious 2D/3D hybrid.  Outdoors, you control a freely roaming camera that allows you to move across town and reorient direction.  The graphics are beautiful, mainly because the camera never gets very close to buildings or people, and the weather effects are attractive.  Rooms inside your home look good as well, because the camera simply turns on its axis while viewing 2D backdrops with hotspots.  The main rooms in stores are another matter.  Here, you and your apprentices move along prefigured 3D tracks through one or more rooms.  The lack of textures and object detail makes for a very unpleasant working environment.  Blockish polygons are particularly noticeable on your workers; you can slice a finger open on their corners as they wander around.  Presumably they were put in place to furnish a sense of realism, but they walk and look like automatons.  Nor does it make much sense for the storerooms to have eternally empty shelves, although the stores' pull-up menus show you as having a large and varied stock.     Menus that display objects you can make, items you can acquire and portraits of townsfolk are truly terrible, with poor art and few colors.  It doesn't help that the portraits feature only a couple of barely varied facial types, and many faces that are identical.  I had three female apprentices in one building who were complete look-alikes, yet no one informed me in advance that I was hiring the Andrew Sisters.  This made it very difficult to analyze work assignments.   Not that analyzing work assignments is easy, in any case.  There's no centralized screen showing what each of the apprentices in every one of your shops is doing; in fact, you can't even find out what apprentices are up to in any given shop unless you highlight a shop activity.  Then and only then are you given a visual representation of an apprentice's head, their name, and a symbol of their current activity.  Regrettably, some of the potions look so much alike that it's impossible to tell even then what all your workers are up to.  If you've hired a master who is controlling a shop's staff, you're not even allowed to look at his task assignments, which is ridiculous.  I had to turn off the AI, in order to see the assignments he'd made, then turn it back on.   Other aspects of the game's interface are quite good.  The clock that can be clicked to speed up and slow down time's passage is a nice touch.  I also like the small 2D floorplans that appear whenever you're inside any building, letting you navigate the various rooms at a click without searching for linking hotspots.  Outside, the floorplans are replaced by a small 2D map of the town you can pull up, with buttons that highlight the buildings owned by dynasties, council members, etc.  Hovering the mouse over a building brings up a few words about its function and owner; clicking moves you there quickly.   Another expeditious shortcut involves assigning F-keys to jump to various locations around town.  The game initially configures four of these for you, attached to the marketplace, town council, your home study and main business room.  But assigning locations is much more difficult than it should have been.  Instead of simply hitting an F-key while over the screen you want to link, you have to hit F12, scroll through pictures of the various F keys, then click with your mouse on the one you want to assign.  This is so high on the unnecessary complexity scale that it leaves me breathless with awe.  Why aren't these programmers working for defense contractors?    The Seamy Underside of Medieval Programming  European games have a reputation among US gamers for being shoddily designed.  Not badly designed; just given to the public without concern for final testing and polishing.  You know the sort of thing: misspellings, features that don't work as they should, etc.  It's a slur whose accuracy can be easily disproved: the manuals for many of the best games available from topflight American producers list developers in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere.  But there remain a core of foreign games that spread this impression in the US, and unfortunately, Europa 1400 is one of them.   Consider, gracious reader: in selected years, a traveling poet appears in your town.  If you take the time out to visit his open-air performance, your rating with all members of a specific profession may well improve.  The only problem is that both the manual and the game state that he shows up in the marketplace, when in fact he's nowhere near it.  He's actually close to one of the inner walls of the town, on a platform.   He's a bit difficult to locate even when you've finally found him, since the theatrical platform doesn't display on the game's 2D map, while the 3D map covers a lot of scrollable territory.  So why not set up an F-key link to that destination?  Unfortunately, the game regards the entire outdoors as a single destination.  No matter where you set the hotkey?in front of the poet's platform, by the town gates, over a specific building?an outdoors hotkey will always return you to the marketplace.   A feature I like is the way Europa 1400 provides you with instant event notification.  No matter where you are, you can click on a message icon and view the results, or ask to be transported to the relevant location if you think some further interaction is warranted.  However, the game engine only stores sites that exist when a new world is generated.  So if a message appears informing you that one of your apprentices has finished harvesting ten batwings in your alchemy shop's cellar (a room you have to build at some point) and you click to go there, you're simply transferred to your main workshop room.  It's a minor nuisance, but symptomatic.   Then, there was the time I'd forgotten to hire some protection while transporting one item from the marketplace, worth roughly 128 coins, back to my shop.  Normally this is an automated process that occurs while you attend to other matters.  However, on this occasion my cart was set upon by robbers.  I was offered the opportunity to fight, drop all items, or leave behind items worth approximately 22 or 70 coins while fleeing.  I chose the ~22 coins~ option, and wound up losing the only item on the cart.  Selections with the same numbers were provided on a similar occasion when I had items worth more than 300 coins in a cart.  Why hadn't the developers coded this bit of programming to look at the actual contents of the cart, and provided accurate statements of worth?   This sense of sloppiness is only increased by Europa 1400's superior English translation, where an occasional word left in the original German stands out like a tie-dyed shirt at a Bavarian beer garden.  Then, there's the automated tutorial: very basic, as such things usually are, but still good in explaining and exploring some of the interface controls and game locations.  At every visited site you're encouraged to experiment with those controls?for fifteen seconds.  Every ten seconds after that, a pleasant voice repeatedly and annoyingly asks you to move on to the next tutorial section.  I'm not quite sure, but it may be just about the most anal-retentive bit of coding I've encountered this side of trying to completely uninstall Microsoft Internet Explorer.   The manual, alas, is little better.  Important facts, like the banking and loan system, are completely ignored.  Large lists that belong in the appendix, like the privileges that cover six pages, are thrown into the middle.  Playing Europa 1400 is a frustrating experience.  There's so much about it that's conceptually clever and distinctive, counterbalanced by some inadequate execution and sloppy coding.  It could have been a great game.  As it is, it's the kind of game that either enthralls you for days on end or drives you up the wall to gnaw at the curtain rods.  Or both.  Yes, definitely both, in my case. I swear at some of the design choices made by 4Head Studios, but only after I've finished a four-hour gaming session. In the end, I find that the positives outweigh the negatives significantly. The AI handles the tasks of administering your businesses adequately, and manages to provide a reasonably nasty and versatile challenge as you advance into the social/political game.  Above all, the variety of gameplay in different professions, the dozens of goals and actions, the shifting panoply of magical items and interacting personalities makes this game high on my replayability list.  Sure, it would have looked better and played easier if Frog City (Imperialism II) had developed it; but flaws acknowledged, Europa 1400 is still a fascinatingly different, complex and addictive experience.  It's only fair to state that your opinion could differ, depending upon how well you can tolerate the maddening details I've discussed.", "date": "Nov 27, 2002"}
