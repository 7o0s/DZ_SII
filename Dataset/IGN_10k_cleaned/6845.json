Though it's far from perfect and not particularly original, it's nevertheless a mildly entertaining excuse to destroy all the rest of the Nazis you weren't able to wipe out in all those other Nazi-huntin' games.   Developed by Russian-based software studio Burut CT for Germany's CDV, UberSoldier chronicles the exploits of one Karl Stolz, a respected Nazi soldier killed in the line of duty just a year before the end of WWII. The plot wouldn't go much further here if not for the efforts of a certain Ernst Schafer, a Nazi scientist who'd recently discovered the secrets of...drum roll please...bringing the dead back to life. Stolz is resuscitated to aid the Nazi cause, but instead heeds the words of the first person he sees when he awakens -- a member of the French resistance -- and immediately jumps ship to join the good guys.    A Nazi-based shooter with elements of the supernatural -- who woulda thunk it?    The undead Stolz is a far superior fighting machine than your run-of-the-mill Nazi. He now has a few semi-superpowers at his disposal, including a nifty ~Time Shield~ that stops bullets in mid-air and fires them back at the shooters, and an ~Emotion System~ that automatically recharges his powers when he offs a certain number of Nazis within a predetermined time frame. Of course, he'll also utilize a wide variety of weapons along the way, including machine guns, rifles, and grenades. He'll temporarily commandeer anti-aircraft guns and cannons, fire torpedoes from submarines, and blow up tanks with sticks of dynamite. Indeed, Stolz can use virtually any weapon he sees, provided he first kills the original owner.   When you first fire up the game, you'll notice that UberSoldier takes forever to load. Whether you're launching the application, loading a level, or simply trying to replay from your most recent quick save, the game takes forever to plunk you into the action. This is a terrible bit of news considering how often you'll need to restart from a quick save.   If you can somehow see by the cliche-riddled plot, there's no guarantee you'll make it through the equally cliche-riddled, slipshod FMV segments. In fairness to the developer, UberSoldier is quite probably initially intended for audiences who speak a language other than English, but the voice acting and the lip-synching is nonetheless positively brutal. Like an Ed Wood movie, actors speak their lines as if it were their first read of the script. It certainly doesn't help that the script itself is lousy to begin with, or that tyrannical madmen speak with the lilt of pacifistic scientists and vice-versa. The obvious fact that the words don't synchronize with the movements of characters' mouths goes almost unnoticed because everything else is so ridiculously bad.   Then there's the little matter of system requirements. With all its graphical detail levels cranked, UberSoldier is a near-impossibility on all but the most muscle-bound systems. Even knocked back to 800x600 and medium detail, the game hungers for its recommended (not minimum) system requirements. The good news is that it's a visual treat even when operated well below its full graphic potential.   Indoors, the game runs the gamut from dank sewer to plush auditorium to disgustingly urine-soaked bathroom to human experimentation laboratory and all things between. The lighting varies nicely from location to location, and the walls and floors are liberally decorated with appropriate furnishings and assorted odds and ends. It's all very animated: air duct fans rotate, large pieces of machinery chug and whirr, and control panels blink and flash. The outdoor world is equally rife with realistic appointments, and at no time do you get the impression the development team grew lazy adding their decorative flair.   If you're an impressionable young kid, UberSoldier is likely not for you. Of course, warnings like that will probably compel you to immediately go out and buy the thing, but be aware that the game delivers a gritty portrayal of war and killing. Heads aren't decapitated and limbs do not fly asunder, but the ambience is gritty and at least marginally disturbing. Shoot a guy and the nearby walls and floor will run red with his blood. Shoot him a few times in the face and that face will quickly become a reddened, leaking pulp. And if your intended target happens to be in close proximity to a grenade blast, he'll grab his head and stumble about in concussed, wailing agony until you put him out of his misery. Indeed, rendering one or two or more of your enemies temporarily out of service with a grenade then finishing them off while they're still suffering is a ghoulish but effective technique.    The general atmosphere is one of bleakness and impending doom. You'll creep through the surgical home of madmen Nazi doctors, noting the trails of blood and the remnants of operations gone wrong. Bodies lie twisted on the ground or sometimes upside down, crumpled against a wall or other objects, or gruesomely suspended from ropes or balconies. Soldiers may die on the edge of a precipice, only to fall rag doll-like to the ground when hit by a stray bullet. The music is understated, moody and depressing, and the UberSoldier world is littered with rusting hunks of metal, broken glass, burning bits of scenery, and the raw stench of death. It ain't pretty, but it is grimly realistic.   Shattering windows aren't the only dynamic elements in the UberSoldier world. Boxes, chairs, tables, and the like are all movable. Shoot them with your gun, ensure they're in the blast zone of your grenade, or merely walk up to them and give them a gentle nudge, and they'll tumble around. Some of the larger objects are far too easy to push around, but better they be mobile than strangely stationary. And as expected in games of this ilk, explosives-laden barrels are positioned strategically throughout most levels, the flames and smoke from which are beautifully rendered.     UberSoldier hums along to the standard and now somewhat antiquated shooter standard popularized a bazillion years ago in the original Nazi-focused FPS, Wolfenstein 3D. That is, it demands an almost constant reliance on the quick save command. Yes, there are a ton of enemies out there, some of which are human, some of which are Nazi mutants. However, the game doesn't feel unreasonably repetitive.   UberSoldier enemies are not an exceedingly bright lot, but they're often cunning and very, very reactive. Indeed, they'll open up their machine guns within a millisecond of seeing you. They'll heave grenades that land on the ground with a metallic clang -- thus forcing you to run as far away as quickly as possible -- or hit you dead on and blow you up instantly. They'll sneak up behind you, and they'll generally spot you before you can see their faces. Ambushes are common.   When you're hit hard with ordnance or suffer the concussive effects of a nearby grenade explosion, you temporarily lose your eyesight. The screen darkens or becomes a blur of squiggly lines and muted colors reminiscent of a 1960s anti-drug public service film. The music takes on a dirge-like quality, and it's game over -- until you begin again at your last quick save point. In fact, because the enemy approaches in precisely the same manner each and every time you enter a given fray, you may want to plunge headlong into obvious traps several times over and consequently die several times over, just for practice. In this way, UberSoldier is far from unique.      But to truly excel, you need to adopt a somewhat stealthy approach that involves more sneaking than rampaging. An overhead compass keeps you apprised of the whereabouts of your goals and your enemies, and you can use this along with smart weapon management and crafty movements to continue fighting the good fight ad infinitum. In most zones, patience and a few opportunistic shots are infinitely preferable to running in guns ablaze.    Stolz can crouch and jump but he cannot run. He'll climb the many ladders you'll find within most levels, but will fall off and hurt himself if he doesn't keep a firm grip. Generally, you do not need to search about for keys or levers to unlock each new door you come across (though keys are sometime necessary), but you will absolutely need to take cover behind whatever crate, vehicle, table or other scenery element that happens to be close by. You'll also want to keep your eyes trained upward to watch for the numerous snipers and other ne'er do wells perched on second and third story windows and atop stairwells and catwalks.    Weapons, bullets, grenades, and health cubes (for want of a better description) are scattered liberally about most theatres of operation, and more of the same will pop instantly into view if you blow up or otherwise kill the evildoers. The game also allows you to retreat back through doors into rooms or sectors through which you've already passed to grab any first aid packs or weapons that you've left behind. One problem: When selecting a weapon from the five you're permitted to store in your arsenal, you won't know whether it's empty or fully loaded until you actually have it in your hands. This can be a real pain in the midst of a frantic firefight.   UberSoldier does not support multiplayer uber-ing, a real disappointment for those who know fighting a human is more rewarding and more interesting than dealing with AI enemies.Not exactly revolutionary and in most ways not even evolutionary, UberSoldier sinks even further into mediocrity with its appalling load times, pathetic voice acting, and power-hungry coding. However, its environments and scenery are quite magnificent, its battle concepts compelling and its AI adequate. The game is gritty enough for those who've already been desensitized to the cartoonish violence of typical shooters, and the hero is capable of at least one highly unusual, innovative trick. That's enough to make it worthy of investigation by the majority of FPS fans.", "date": "Apr 18, 2006"}
