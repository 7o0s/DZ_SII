What can another Final Fantasy offer fans and newcomers that couldn't be sourced from other games? That was the angle we took when plotting our course through another epic Square Enix adventure. Were we surprised? Do all new fighting mechanics add to the series? And what about the now-geriatric PS2 hardware? Can it do justice to the original vision? Above all, does the fire still burn brightly? Yes. Yes, and yes and yes and yes. XII further cements this series' place atop the JRPG ladder; its quality, art direction, storytelling and presentation shine like a beacon for gamers lost in a sea of mediocrity.   Yes, it is no exaggeration that this is arguably the finest playing, freshest Final Fantasy ever; from the opening moments of the game, after the stunning, typically eye-popping CG opening, you are thrust into combat. Your hand is held throughout the experience, since it would be a grand oversight to assume that players and traditionalists would be able to cope with tackling the new combat system from the outset.    In simplified terms, fighting, magic-casting and movement on the battlefield has been unlocked - no longer are your characters confined to a rigid line of three or four. Instead, you nominate a party leader whom you control, and you actively move your character around the world, without breaking away to a separate screen for combat.   Vaan, the slightly effeminate hero, in a Mediterranean-inspired town.   The result is the death of random battles and the rebirth of true gameplay. For autopilot gamers accustomed to hitting X repeatedly and then pressing on through the world, this might come as a shock to the system. On the other hand, another major tweak to the combat gives these gamers a series of automated strategies called Gambits to play around with. Gambits allow for automatic attack, healing, spellcasting, and a ridiculous number of very specific variations thereof. However, before we dive into how this system works and whether it is a sensible improvement, let's get back to basics.   Since combat no longer pulls you onto a separate screen, enemies are scattered around open plains and inside dungeons, fully visible. This means you can be as selective as you wish to be when it comes to picking your battles. Approaching an enemy prompts them to attack you. Doing so will cause a thin glowing line to project out of your character's head in an arc, connecting you to your target and vice versa. This is the first tentative steps towards a new fighting system. Tapping X brings up your traditional FF menu system governing your actions.   Aside from being able to roam freely, combat plays out very much like past FF titles. This is pleasing from a fan standpoint, since there are certain things that just shouldn't be messed with. On the other hand, some things should be. For instance, XII introduces two more game-changing elements to the mix: Licences and Hunts. To be fair, Licences are the logical evolution of ideas established in IX's Gem Board and X's Sphere Grid.     In order to use any newly-found piece of armour, weapons or abilities, you must spend your experience points on unlocking the licence. Each licence you unlock frees up ones surrounding it on an asymmetrical checkerboard grid. Simple, but by the end of the game, you'll have steered each character into very specific strengths; though, the underlying freedom means every character can potentially be a magic user or axeman. It's one of the niftiest improvements outside of the combat overhaul.   Hunting is an extension of the Final Fantasy Tactics system of assignment-choosing. In reality, it's just a large scale, worldwide assassination mission, where you are given a target to bump off (generally animal or monster), and a suitable bounty as reward. It can be a neat distraction that eventually nets good gear and Gil for those willing to trek the miles. How much this appeals to you is entirely dependant on your dedication and enjoyment of the combat system - but let it be noted, loot in XII is sparse. This is a good way to make up the difference.   The story, which many have rightly likened to the Star Wars series, is arguably deeper and more involving than anything that Lucas ever fleshed out on his jotter pad. This is high-fantasy with a heavy political slant. Attempting to summarise the story is futile (not to mention a joy-killer for fans), but revolves around a street-smart young boy, Vaan, and his desire to do his bit for the good of the nation. A nation which, as fate would have it, is sandwiched between two other warring territories and is about to be thrown into chaos. Your regular assortment of sideshow freaks, slick rebels and positive female role-models join Vaan early on.     Ashe and Balthier probably fall into the 'stereotype' pit more than they should - each play to a specific role - the tough, opinionated princess and the pithy, smooth-operating sky pirate respectively. What they lack in originality goes some way towards actually making the experience more digestible. Too much change to fundamental elements of the series and Square might as well have birthed an entirely new series of Japanese RPG. Basche, on the other hand, is fascinating and conflicted. His is a tortured soul; he is also an older, rougher face in amongst his cherubic, flawless companions. Great stuff.    Many trademark elements of the series make prominent appearances - Chocobos, Moogles, Cid, Summons, bad hairdos, sneering enemies and ridiculous, gravity-defying airships. This is undoubtedly token stuff for non-FF players. However, for fans, XII integrates all of these elements in surprising ways. Moogles particularly play a larger part than in past iterations. More akin to the MMORPG instalment Final Fantasy XI, they are a fully-fledged society and their appearance is more akin to a rabbit than a cuddly teddy bear.   Apparently, environmental polygonal detail and character models were simplified in XII; the reason being, the PS2 is not a powerhouse and sacrifices have to be made if you want to tinker with higher-quality textures and improved special effects. To be certain, Square Enix made the right decision. Not only is it virtually impossible to tell that the characters are composed of fewer triangles, but the world is sharp, varied and astounding. You'll genuinely wonder where the PS2 was hiding this kind of power - the truth is, it was never hiding; it just took one of the world's finest developers to get clever with the hardware.    This is a breathtaking-looking game. Cities, desert townships, grimy dungeons and verdant forests are rendered with care, mimicking the pre-vis artwork and demonstrating many real-world cultural influences, such as Mediterranean and Arabic fashion, mixed with the heavy arms of the dark ages and high-art of the Renaissance. They're the best at what they do, Square Enix.   However, there are definitely issues that need to be addressed by the time Final Fantasy XIII rolls out the door. Some could be attributed directly to hardware issues: constant loading between areas is grating and breaks up the otherwise flowing path of the journey. Then there is the inevitable level grind scenario, where you'll undoubtedly end up spending a good deal of your time just killing stuff on the open plains to raise your stats. Some might argue that this unavoidable for the genre; we think that you shouldn't ever reach a point in an RPG where you're forced to gain several levels to get past a boss. No matter how good the combat is, that's just padding the gameplay.   Other issues spring from creative direction decisions. Voice-acting is a mixed bag in XII, considering the spot-on job done in X. Some less critical people might let certain dud lines and flat jokes slide, but not this one. Balthier in particular is arguably miscast. He's just not right in that role.    Combat in XII looks complex in still images, but is logical and refreshing in practice.  Conspicuously absent from the production roster is long-time FF composer, Nobuo Uematsu, whose themes have attained classic status. He is replaced by another veteran musician, Hitoshi Sakimoto, of Radiant Silvergun fame. Sakimoto does a good job at composing an epic score, but many of his tunes fall short of catchy or even memorable. It's very good nonetheless, but it's no VI or VII.   Of course, such concerns are small potatoes. Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that PAL nation gamers are forced to wait for translations that can take up to a year to be implemented. And with no option for a Japanese dub, it makes the occasionally grating voices all the more regrettable. Still, with XIII coming to the PS3 at some point, perhaps Blu-ray's superior storage space will allow for the inclusion of a Japanese dub. That, clearly, is still a far off proposition. For now, as the lead curtain falls on the PS2, Final Fantasy is back for one last powerful, funny, lovely, surprising and - most importantly - improved outing. Ever wanted to dip your toes in the series? Now is your chance; for those returning, it's time to embark.    Final Fantasy XII should be remembered warmly for two main reasons. One, it proved that having a large budget and high ambitions doesn't mean the end result will be shallow and vacuous Hollywood-equivalent drivel. Two, Square Enix went out of their way to prove that there is more to developing an amazing game than simply riding a coattail or milking a series. They have successfully modernised the title by removing core elements and replacing them with superior ones - all without losing that unmistakable Final Fantasy 'feel'. Our favourite game in the series? Nah, that credit still rests with VI or VII. But for the best overall experience, XII reigns over all others.", "date": "Feb 21, 2007"}
