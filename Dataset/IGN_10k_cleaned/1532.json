{"name": "Chicken Run", "name_review": "Chicken Run", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/23/chicken-run-3", "text": "I don't like to think about the meat on my plate. I like to eat it. But Aardman Animation's Chicken Run was the kind of movie that made people think twice about their meat. How can you eat something that's so cute, so alive, so human?  You can, and even if you've seen the movie, you still do. But that's saying nothing against the immensely enjoyable animated film, which is basically a retelling of Stalag 17 (and half a dozen other WWII POW movies) re-enacted by chickens. The great escape is back on the drawing plans in Eidos' new Chicken Run game based on the film, and this time, it's your feathers that will be in the fryer if you're not careful.  Many have called this game Chicken Gear Solid, and the comparison is surprisingly accurate. You don't have Snake's studly sack of weapons and high-tech gadgets, but when it comes to espionage, these stealthy poultry take a page right out of the Foxhound textbook. Blitz Games has clearly seen the light in the shadows of Konami's classic, and though this game doesn't nearly pull off the sneaky covert operation gameplay as well as Kojima-san, it's still fun to cruise around the coups in the shadows.  What isn't much fun, however, is the camera system used for the stealth aspects. At every turn, you're fighting the camera system in Chicken Run, which is sometimes user-controlled, and other times completely and inexplicably automatic. The chicken and enemy characters are so big and the screen is zoomed in so much that it's tough to see what's up ahead. Also working against the mission is the radar, which pings too short a distance to be useful. By the time you see an enemy on radar on in the game, they've already got you in their clutches.  Other than the wonky camera, Chicken Run is an enjoyable adventure game. You guide Ginger (and eventually Rocky Rhodes the Rhode Island Red Rooster Wonder Chicken) around on the farm collecting up implements to build wacky contraptions that may help the flock escape. Sneaking into buildings and around the farm is a constant challenge, with monstrous patrol dogs and searchlights swooping all over the grounds. The chickens will have to stay out of the light and avoid stepping on things that might make a noise and attract attention -- it's Metal Gear Solid with a pullet in the mullet.  Adventure aspects are always enjoyable, and the game is structured to give plenty of replay value. The world is packed with tools to interact with, constantly creating new puzzles to solve. Each mission is graded and can be repeated for better scores. Better yet, Chicken Run's adventure is broken up constantly by wacky mini-games -- some straight from the film, some inventive and exciting new concoctions. These sections also can be replayed for better ratings, and all have solid and challenging controls. Some are simple arcade challenges, like firing chickens latched onto fireworks through windows or catapulting chickens onto floating boats (and in a sick twist, if you land two chickens on one boat, one knocks the other off the sinking float), but the handling is almost entirely unique in the game for these ordinary games. And major sequences, like where the chickens dress up as Mrs. Tweedy to escape the dogs, is hilariously drawn and animated, all while being a riot to play.  Visually, Chicken Run is well-handled and animated, looking very true to Aardman Studio's extraordinary style. Characters even look suspiciously like their Claymation counterparts, with smooth, rounded bodies and exaggerated motions in the oversized characters. Look carefully at the faces, and you'll even see the recessed, separated flat teeth that are a big part of Nick Park's trademark style of expression. Animation of in-game models in close-ups is disappointing, since the lip movement looks nothing like the Claymation figures. The lips tuck and move well, but they're not synched to the dialog, and the eyes don't work much for any expression other than dull happiness. Overall, the slack in the close-ups show pretty clearly that this game was designed for a kid audience and cut in some corners. It's a shame, because otherwise the game looks superb, and since so much time is spent talking, it'd be nice if this feature was more polished.  In the environments, Blitz has nailed the atmosphere and detail work of the motion picture. Every cage and slop pen is drawn dark and yet wonderfully colorful at night, then glowingly sunny again in the day time. Except for that crooked camera, which steps hard on the gameplay, particularly in action sequences and tight sequences, the game makes a good approximation of the film.  Unfortunately, you get the feeling that Chicken Run was rushed for Christmas without full polish. The audio is really sloppy, with missing or muted effects for things that are very, very important. When Snake ran across a grate and alerted a guard to his presence, you knew you were in trouble. Chicken Run doesn't have that immediacy in the low-res sound effects and weak key sounds. Also chopped badly is the FMV of the film used, which gets short-changed in poor transitions between sequences -- the load time kicks in before the film has a chance to even fade out.  And speaking of loads, the disc management in Chicken Run isn't very efficient at all. The disc will spin wildly even in transitions between environments that should be one intact unit -- when moving from different yards, the game loads even when you can see part of the yard you're moving to. Not that the chopped sequencing really affects a more or less static adventure, but it is quite annoying to sit so much of this short game staring at a blank load screen. We've also had a bad crash with a box copy the first day we picked it up off a shelf -- big no-no.  It may sound like harping on the bad sound and disappointing character animation, but this is what Aardman is known for, and it shouldn't have been done so weakly. This is the studio that has cinched plenty of Oscars and other accolades for sound effect editing, and the chirpy quality and limited sound here is a bummer, particularly since the music sampled from the film is so grand. The voice work is also of great quality -- sound-alikes were used (you really thought Mel Gibson would come back to dub a videogame?), but though they're not spot-on replications, the quality of the voices is superb in comparison to the original.  All told, the gameplay of Chicken Run is innovative and exciting to play through, and since expectations were probably fairly low anyway (who puts faith in a kid's game to be great), it's a pleasant surprise. Though quite challenging (and made unfair by the dreadful camera), it would still bowl young fans over. However, you might want to run it through a rental and see if the maddening camera doesn't stop you from baking this otherwise enjoyable game.   --Marc Nix", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
