But they haven't. Since Vice City, attempts at creating such large-scale working worlds have paled in comparison. Enter Midtown Madness 3. Although it is a much different experience than Vice City, MM3 offers some of the most fleshed-out game environments we've seen this or any year. It boasts two fully functioning metropolises for gamers to frolic in, and the cities are quite amazing to behold. But is the experience that takes place within them worth all the trouble? Indeed it is.   The third installment in a series developed by Digital Illusions and begun on the PC, Midtown Madness 3 is at its heart a street racer. But it doesn't boast merely the souped-up, tricked out rides of Midnight Club 2. Instead, in MM3, you'll race everything from a garbage truck to a MINI Cooper to a Chevy SSR, and you'll do it in the very recognizable confines of Washington D.C. and Paris.   While the single player experience is fulfilling (if a bit predictable), this game is all about the multiplayer, especially on Xbox Live. If you own Xbox Live and like racing games, MM3 is a no-brainer. In fact, if you like racing games at all, this is a reason to get an Xbox and Xbox Live.  Gameplay  Let's start with the important stuff. This game is fun. It's not just a little fun, it's terribly fun. It's call-in-sick-to-work, stay up until four in the morning fun. Is it ~buy an Xbox and sing its praises from the highest mountain~ fun? If you're into racing games, it sure is.  But before I get ahead of myself, let me clarify. I'm talking about the multiplayer experience. I'm talking about the mad scramble that is Xbox Live. Sure, the single player is cool, but it doesn't even begin to approach the level of enjoyment to be gleaned from online play. It's a training ground, a warm-up for the main event. More on single player later. What we're really trying to get to the bottom of is what makes it so enjoyable.  Strategy Guide Available! Stuck in traffic? We've got detailed, official maps of D.C. and Paris!   Find every paint can, know every turn, even learn the street names! Become the slickest driver online!  Get The Guide! | MM 3 Message Boards First off, as we've already stated, the cities are amazing. Just the fact that they are so open and interactive and, well... alive, is a technical feat. We've seen it flashes of this kind of thing from other games, but DICE makes it breathe. What's more, there are two gargantuan and fully recognizable metropolises for gamers to tear up. That means crashing through guard rails, plowing through cafes (you know you've always wanted to do that), dodging traffic, and terrorizing pedestrians... in two time zones!  Aside from the great environments, the thing that bears most mention is the excellent collision detection. This is always crucial in a racing game, and it's been nailed here. If you catch even the slightest corner of a building or car, your momentum will be affected. Likewise, if you're trading paint in a checkpoint or multiplayer race, you'll feel it, and your cars will affect one another. This is all based on collision detection, and it's nearly perfect.  So, too, are the car physics. While a lot of racing games feel good to drive, this one feels natural. Each car boasts its own unique properties, and as such, you'll need to master a broad range of skills to triumph. But you'll have slick, intuitive controls at your fingertips, and graceful environment physics so that you won't get too frustrated. What do I mean by that? In many racing games, if you're going to plow through a block all willy-nilly, your car will get turned by every little thing. But the emphasis in MM3 is on frenetic, cross-town driving mayhem, so if you get a nice head of steam going, even a MINI will turn back bigger vehicles and keep moving forward.  That's not to say that your progress can't be halted by a steel fence or iron dumpster, or by the large garbage truck parked across the road. It can. But the game is not hung up on these details. The challenge is to get through the city creatively and quickly, not to avoid everything in sight. In fact, using walls to bang off of, and driving down stairs, and plowing through the occasional row of station wagons is part of the charm.  So that's why the game in general is fun. As the old saying goes, ~it's easy to pick up but hard to put down.~ But what makes Xbox Live so damned enjoyable? The mayhem of it all. Although the servers are not yet hopping with the well-practiced driving studs of two weeks from now, it's easy to find a rousing game within any of the six online modes: Cruise, Checkpoint, Capture the Gold, Tag, Hunter, and Stayaway. There are a lot of set-ups options if you choose to host a game, and just as many if you're particular about the kind of race you want to experience.  The game types are all enjoyable. Cruise lets you wild out and explore with a group of folks. Checkpoint is, as you may have guessed, a checkpoint race through one of the towns. Capture the Gold is perhaps the best mode, and functions as Capture the Flag does in FPS games. In Tag, you have to touch another car to get rid of being 'it' before your times runs out, or you're booted. Hunter forces you either to be a predator or prey, and the object is to be the last car preyed upon. Finally, Stayaway is another game of cat and mouse. You have to hold an object--in this case the rabbit--longer than anyone else.  Except for Cruise, every mode has a frantic appeal. The thrill of the chase is captured perfectly. When you and five other gamers are in hot pursuit of one lone car, it feels cinematic, it feels exhilrating. It feels right. And when you give someone the slip and narrowly avoid a collision at the most opportune time, you're guaranteed a smile. The players so far have been plenty cordial as well. While some online games have been overrun by bickering and petty play, there is a good spirit and sense of camaraderie about this game. And that's a welcome thing.  The single player experience will prep you for online play, and get you used to the cities, but on its own it isn't quite as fulfilling. In fact, if the game shipped with the single player component only, it wouldn't be nearly as good. Why? It's much more exciting (and variable) to outrun a human than it is a calculating machine. And while it feels good to beat some of the races, it all gets repetitive after awhile. That's not say you can't a dozen or so enjoyable hours out of single player. When stacked up next to the likes of Midnight Club 2's solo options, it holds its own. But multiplayer is still where it's at.  Each city is split up into two game modes, which are further subdivided. In Single Race mode, you can choose to Cruise the city, or compete in Blitz and Checkpoint races. Cruise allows you to explore the city at your leisure, finding jumps and shortcuts, and learning the course. Blitz is a checkpoint race against the clock, while Checkpoint allows you to compete against other drivers in similar kinds of races. Both of these modes can be enjoyable, and quite challenging in the upper reaches. What's cool about them, however, is that your competition is based on the car you pick. If you choose to race a garbage truck, you'll have more time to complete the Blitz Race. If racing Checkpoint, all of the other drivers will be outfitted with vehicles in that general speed range. This makes for more variation, and allows for gamers with different styles to succeed.  The other option available in both cities is Work Undercover mode. This allows you to complete a story of sorts, where you work your odd jobs and progress up the employment ladder. While the Blitz and Checkpoint races can be very fun, working undercover simply gets tedious. The jobs aren't that interesting, and many of them mimic other games we've seen (especially Crazy Taxi).   In all modes, you can collect paint cans that are scattered throughout the city. You have to be driving the ride of the paint can you seek, so much of the challenge is getting the particular car into the right place to snag the item. The paint can challenges add a collection element to a game which is already stuffed with replay value. Like Vice City, this game just keeps on giving.    Graphics  Since there's already been so much said about the cities--their scope, authenticity and attention to detail, there is little left to say about them except this... they are gorgeous. Paris looks just like Paris, and Washington D.C. looks just as it should. For the most part, there is amazing draw distance, so you can see deep into the city when you're driving.  The vehicles you're exploring these wonderful burghs in are no slouches, either. From the tiny FLE to the mammoth Freightliner, the rides all look like their real life counterparts. Even when they get damaged they look pretty, mainly because the damage is done so well. Kudos to DICE  for procuring licenses they are able to rough up a bit...  In addition to damage effects on car models, the damage to environments looks convincing as well. Plowing into plate glass leads to a shower of shards on the hood of your car. Taking out a traffic light will yield a shower of sparks. Attention to minute details like these make the game that much more special.  Midtown Madness 3 runs smooth for the most part, and it needs to. It does a good job of promoting a sensation of speed, and that begins with framerate. It's locked down in the single player experience, and only hiccups slightly when players enter or exit the Live games.   Honestly, there is very little to gripe about in the graphics department. There is limited pop-up throughout the game, and sometimes the camera will take up a position halfway inside a car, so that only half of the texture shows. But these are minor gripes. None are disruptive, and only slightly loony graphics fiends will care.   Sound As you might expect by now, the technical brilliance displayed elsewhere in MM3 extends to sound. Featuring Dolby Digital loveliness, the game sounds great. The individual engine noises, coupled with the ambient noise of the city, are a delight to hear.  Voice acting is also good, if a bit over the top. Most is saved for the Work Undercover story mode, and some of it is quite humorous. The Parisian stuff could possible offend those who balk at stereotypes, but it's well-done nonetheless.  What the Xbox has over every console on the market, of course, is the ability to rip tracks to the hard drive. No place has it been exploited more than in driving games. The playlist feature is available in MM3, but it does not offer quite as many options as we would have liked. The interface for managing the tracks is a little clunky, and if you dump a large number of tracks onto the playlist at once, there is no way to re-sort them.   There also seems to be a bit of glitch with the randomization of tracks. Although I had three full CDs dumped into the playlist, it always seemed to hang on the same couple of songs, repeating them over and over. Through a particular series of challenges, I listened to the same track six times in a row. If only there were a song advance option while playing, this problem would have not been as annoying. But alas, there is not.  If you love Xbox Live games, buy. If you like racing games, buy. If you like the idea of driving a MINI over the cobblestoned streets of Paris, buy. As a single player game alone, it's about an 8.0, but as a multiplayer game, it approaches the mid-nines. This is the most impressive first-party title since Rallisport Challenge, and it's well worth your well-earned dollars.", "date": "Jun 19, 2003"}
