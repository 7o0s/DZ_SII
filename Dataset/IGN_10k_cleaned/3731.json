The game takes players through colorfully exaggerated locales complete with groups of enemies, libraries of platform challenges, and a host of minor environmental puzzles in between, all sewed together with tight, if unoriginal control mechanics. Like Luigi's Mansion before it, Wario World is generally fun while it lasts. The problem is that it doesn't last too long.  The Facts  Play as Mario hater, Wario, in his first GameCube title Quasi-3D platformer with classic play controls Explore four worlds spread across 12 different levels Use a variety of Wario-powered moves to stomp and throw enemies into oblivion Do battle with big bosses at the end of each world Game features WarioWare Microgames samples that can be downloaded to Game Boy Advance Single-player Requires 10 memory blocks for saves Runs in progressive scan Dolby Pro Logic II compatible   Gameplay Wario World features a typical Nintendo-ized storyline -- one that revolves around rescuing someone or something that has been kidnapped or stolen respectively. In past Mario games, it's always been Peach. Link has always gone after Zelda. For Wario, nothing is more important than his vast treasure. One day while picking his nose (no, we didn't make this up) Wario hears a loud thunder inside of his castle and soon discovers that his treasure -- all of his gold and priceless artifacts -- is being turned into various monsters. A mysterious black jewel stored in his treasure room is the culprit of the madness, and before Wario can do anything to stop it his entire world is inexplicably transformed into a warped version of its former self. The game begins as Wario embarks upon a quest to smack all of the monsters about the area back into their regular treasure form and rid himself of the pesky black jewel once and for all. The premise here -- like most Nintendo tales -- is flimsy at best, but it doest nicely set up the quirky adventure to follow.  The game itself is a pure platformer that takes place in quasi-3D form. What we mean by this is that while levels are constructed using polygons and there is depth for Wario to run in and out of, the action is shot in such a way that everything looks almost 2D in nature. Treasure has done an adequate job of executing on the style. Most of the levels unfold from left to right, up to down, or vice versa, but there are occasional areas where Wario will actually have to run forward in full 3D or backward toward the screen. The camera follows the character around without stutter, occasionally panning behind a tree or through rafters for effect and it generally works to our satisfaction. However, there are occasional points where, say, Wario will have to jump to a tree branch, but because the camera is shooting the action from a quasi-2D point, it can be difficult to judge exactly where to align him and as a result some players may fall a couple of times before they get it, and this is a flaw in execution.

Download It Now | Wario Message BoardsGet The Guide The point of the game is to simply go through the levels, beat up enemies, solve unsubstantial puzzles, and collect the various treasure needed to proceed. It doesn't sound like much, we know, and ultimately it isn't, but while everything lasts it's fun. This, due in large to very polished control for Wario, an achievement that makes manipulating the character through the locations extremely satisfying. He can be made to perform very precise movements with the analog stick. Meanwhile, A jumps, B punches foes, R executes a powerful dash attack, and L causes Wario to open his mouth wide and suck in coins and treasure. The Y and X buttons are not used. Wario's most unique moves, and perhaps the four that will prove most valuable in the game, are his abilities to pick up and spin enemies around (wild swing ding), throw them, piledrive them, and flip (corkscrew conk). Some puzzles and doorways require that Wario use these abilities to pass. For instance, he may have to pick up and swing an enemy against a lever in order to spin a wheel, which will then open a doorway. These types of tasks are well done in the game.  When Wario is not beating up on multiple enemies at once, he's usually jumping from one platform to another. The art of platforming is enhanced ever so slightly in the game due to Wario's unique ability to grab onto balled objects, which just so happen to frequent most of the worlds -- lucky for us. It's hard not to laugh as the big, dumb oaf jumps, practically sticks to, and then hangs onto one of these objects for dear life; it just looks so wonderfully awkward. More importantly, though, many of the balled objects are hooked to levers and pulleys which rotate around levels, and as part of the puzzles Wario must devise ways through the systems, and these challenges are highly entertaining, though not overly difficult.  No enemy is safe from Wario  Like in Super Mario Sunshine, Wario can travel to a series of bonus levels, too, and not surprisingly these areas look and play similarly to those in the Italian plumber's game. Wario may, for example, have to flip a series of switches in order raise and lower platforms so that he can get to the very top, for instance, or, as in this movie, he may simply have to figure out a way to a platform seemingly stranded in the middle of a hollow circle. In our experience, these additions aren't as difficult as they were in Sunshine, which may disappoint purists, but they're fun all the same. And to round everything off, Wario will also have to do battle with a few different bosses, all of them big and entertaining for their own unique reasons.      There are two problems with Wario World, though, one more important than the other. The first is that the game isn't original by any measure; it's a platformer, and a pretty standard one, that's made fun due to solid control and quirky presentation. The other, the big drawback, is that the game is short. Only four worlds constructed of two levels and a boss fight area each -- a total of 12 levels, if you count bosses. Sure, there are some bonus areas in between, but these are beaten in a matter of seconds, not minutes. Meanwhile, Treasure has created some incentive to collect all the jewels in the game to unlock some WarioWare samples which can be downloaded to a Game Boy Advance. However, because these downloads can't be saved and also because they're only a glimpse of the 200-plus games in the actual GBA title, buyers would be far better off if they just picked up WarioWare. When everything is said and done, Wario World can be breezed through in little more than five hours. Most platform fans will probably have a good time while it lasts, but money conscious buyers will want to consider the length before plunking down the cash.  Graphics Wario World has a colorful, clean look about it which is mostly easy on the eyes. Treasure has succeeded in creating worlds that vary greatly in design, from green forests to weird circuses complete with spotlights that follow Wario around the level. Along his journey, Wario will also visit a haunted house, an ice world, a fire world, and a series of bonus areas that float high in the sky, and each looks fairly good in its own way. There will be times when players will be dazzled. We were surprised in the second boss fight to see the enemy appear dressed in bumped-mapped textures and surrounded by particle and lighting effects. Likewise, there will be points when gamers will find themselves underwhelmed. Most of the environments in the game are constructed with a minimal amount of polygons and as a result objects lack structure detail. The same can be said of character models. Some level textures are crisp and clean while others are low-resolution and as a result lack clarity and look muddy. The game's particle system is fabulous, though, easily spitting out large numbers of sparks that blend gorgeously with the action, and the lighting system, real-time and very pretty, only complements the particle work. To top everything off, the fluidity is locked almost rock solid at 60 frames with the very occasional dip during high-action scenes with lots of enemies and particle effects on-screen at once. The game also runs in progressive scan for anybody with a high-def-ready television, and that's always a plus.  These two bosses team up on Wario halfway through the game Sound Over-the-top. That sums up the audio side of Wario World. And strangely, it works. The music is way out there, a mix of odd noises blended into something resembling a beat. Go the interface menu and players will hear Wario sing, ~Nah nah nah nah nah,~ as part of a song. It's a bit odd, but we like it. The voice work is less impressive simply because there isn't much variation in it. Wario has a couple of one-liners like, ~I'm-a number one!~ and ~Here we go!~; when he throws enemies he might say ~good luck!~ or ~have a rotten day!~ but after the first level or two players will be sick of it. He even puffs out a weird ~meh~ sound every single time he jumps -- funny at first, bothersome later.I have to admit that I left the Electronics Entertainment Expo 2003 with little care for Wario World. Maybe it was because I only had a few minutes with it at a time, or the fact that it was shown in an environment where I couldn't fully see or hear it well, but it just seemed so standard, so boring. The good news, though, is that my impression of the game was wrong. Wario World has turned out pretty well, I think. It doesn't push any boundaries as far as platformers go, but thanks to some great control mechanics and inventive level work I had a great time playing through it. Meanwhile, the visual and audio work both impresses and underwhelms at points. The big problem is that the game is over far too quickly -- about five hours if you try to whip through it and a bit more if you go for all the treasures to unlock the unnecessary WarioWare samples.Also, is there any good reason why this game -- from Treasure -- doesn't have a multiplayer mode of any kind? Like Luigi's Mansion, what's there is good. I just wish there was more of it. I can definitely recommend Wario World as a great rental. But anybody interested in buying it should consider just how quickly it's all over.", "date": "Jun 19, 2003"}
