This boxing series is Midway's entry into the sport, but instead of simulating the game, Midway exaggerated it. The game worked pretty well on the console side of things (especially on the Dreamcast)  on the Game Boy Color, it's a good try, but it lacks a few needed features to make it a great game. Features 10 boxers (seven available,  three hidden) Digitized speech FMV introductions Arcade and Championship modes Only for Game Boy Color  The one area this game excels is presentation. First off, it's in a rumble cartridge  makes sense, since not only is it a boxing title where it'd be cool to feel each hit, it's also called ~Ready 2 Rumble.~ Duh. Second, this game features some of the cleanest digitized speech samples of any Game Boy Color game to date  at the beginning of each round, Michael Buffer (the most famous ring announcer in the industry) announces each fighter by name, as well as the ~Let's Get Ready to Rumble!!!!~ catchphrase to kick off the bout. And finally, you absolutely need to see the awesome FMV introductions for each of the characters. Crawfish Interactive (the Game Boy Color version's developer) took the intro taunts from the Dreamcast version of the game and ported them over to cool looking taunts on the Game Boy Color. They lack the speech of the Dreamcast version, but it's no big loss  just ignore the lip movements.  The Game Boy Color game is as good a port of the console versions as you're going to get on the portable. Instead of the polygonal engine, the characters have been turned into profiled sprites  and only their key moves have been rendered, since the system only has two buttons. The A and B buttons are essentially Left and Right punch, and pressing up and down while pushing a button will get you a high or low punch. Each character has his or her own style, so some character's punches might be slower or faster than others. When you've knocked a fighter down three times, you win the match.  The problem is, the fight is all the Game Boy Color version has. Unlike the console versions, the portable version lacks any type of cool ~training mode~ to build a boxer from scratch. The only two modes in the game are Arcade and Championship  Arcade Mode is just a quick-play mode where you go up against one computer opponent, and Championship Mode is an eight-fight ladder that'll get you an extra fighter if you win. That's it  the game doesn't even have a two player link-cable mode. Huh?  Presentation isn't everything, as experienced in Ready 2 Rumble Boxing. I think the game plays pretty well for a portable version of boxing, but it's missing so much in comparison to the console titles  and even there the game isn't that deep. Why didn't Midway allow a two player mode to be put in? My guess is time restraints  Crawfish Interactive is a talented Game Boy Color developer, and they are certainly capable of programming a link-cable mode (just wait until Street Fighter Alpha hits the Game Boy Color in 2000).  With only two modes in the game, you'll grow bored of Ready 2 Rumble pretty quickly.", "date": "Dec 16, 1999"}
