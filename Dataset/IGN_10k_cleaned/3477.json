With Blue Shift behind the developer's wheel, World Series Baseball hit Xbox with a flourish.  Less than a year later, World Series Baseball 2K3 is coming to both Xbox and PS2.  Lacking online play, which every other Sega sports title has mastered, can WSB 2K3 offer enough improvements to remain ahead of the pack?  Features Full MLB license featuring every MLB team and stadium Hall of Fame team sporting some of baseball's greatest all-time players Hire and fire managers and coaches mid-season Endless oodles of statistics ESPN-style presentation including Pitch Trax Wacky Rex Hudler joins the booth as color man Dolby Digital 5.1  Gameplay Last year I called World Series Baseball the best baseball game I'd ever played.  After spending endless hours plowing through WSB 2K3's Franchise Mode, I'm here to say that the latest iteration of Sega's baseball franchise is even better.  But not by much.  The core gameplay of WSB has returned this year, so those who played the Xbox version last year will find themselves on familiar ground.  However, some additions have been added to the gameplay mix to raise the bar for WSB 2K3.  Fielding Most notable and probably the most wanted addition are wall jumps.  To dive or wall jump (it's context sensitive) just squeeze the right trigger.  However, just because you've got a bead on a ball, doesn't mean you'll automatically nab it.  For one thing, you've got to have impeccable timing.  Second, your player has to have a decent jump stat.  So, Torii Hunter has a much easier time stealing back a home run than Jose Canseco would.  Sadly, Blue Shift has not implemented any balls-bouncing-off-head physics that could recreate Canseco's finest fielding moment.  While wall jumps may be the most noticeable addition, there are actually far more important gameplay elements added this year.  By far the most crucial has been all of the new defensive stats.  Admittedly, your fielding rating meant little last year.  Just about any shortstop could make star plays.  Now, however, there is value in taking a defensive infielder over one with pop but a poor glove.  It's a hard thing to see quantifiable proof of in a game.  While I'm told it's there, that it exists, I can't actually know that the reason Manny Ramirez can't get to a ball in time is anything more than that it was blasted over his head.  I doubt anyone will immediately notice a difference in the way defense plays in WSB 2K3 over WSB.  But, having played the original Xbox version so much last year and giving lots of time to the new WSB 2K3, I've begun to see those differences.  It's more apparent in how great fielders seem to get to many more balls than an average or poor fielder.    Also, fielders will now throw off-target.  So you will see Juan Gonzalez throw a bullet towards home and the catcher may have to take three steps from the plate to secure it.  This is where the difference in fielding ability is most apparent, as a player like Ichiro throws perfect strikes the majority of the time.  With fielders stepping off the bag to get errant throws and leaping in the air as well, there are instance now where you'll see an infielder having to step back to the bag and try to apply a sweep tag on a baserunner.  The fielding is definitely a step-up from last year and adds more realism to an already authentic game.  On the other hand, there is still one major fielding element glaringly absent from World Series Baseball 2K3.  Balls thrown in the infield cannot bounce.  That means that when Eric Chavez moves to his right, spins and throws a ball, it will always fly high in the air.  It may not be caught, it may force the first baseman off the bag, but it will not bounce in the dirt.  The first baseman will never have to dig out a ball.  This makes no sense, since throws from the outfield do bounce on the way through the infield.  Wha?!?  But I have to say that the fielding mechanics are better than last year.  I've yet to encounter a situation where I failed to make a play because a fielder was busy doing some extraneous animation.  When you need a quick throw to first, it's there this year.    Pitching Pitching is handled the same as last year.  You select one of your pitcher's available pitches (there are only nine pitches total in the game), then aim with the cursor (though true gamers will turn the cursor off) and hit A to hurl the ball.  Nothing about the pitching dynamic has changed at all.  And while I dug the pitching last year and still think it's good, EA's exploration into more in-depth pitching with MVP leaves the pitching interface feeling a little less stellar.  However, when you turn the cursor off and try to pitch by feel, the pitching is much more inspiring than what ASB offers.  It's in the middle-ground, but should offer enough of a familiar feel to keep casual baseball fans from running for the hills.  I still think that only having nine pitch choices is acceptable.  However, it might be nice to see what Blue Shift could do with 20 pitch choices.  After all, there are a wide variety of fastballs and different types of change-ups and curveballs in baseball.  Maybe some differences would be subtle, but if Blue Shift is serious about competing to put out the most realistic baseball available, an expansion on the pitching interface is needed.  At least from the standpoint of offering more pitches.  Kudos to the BS team for including the much-needed pitcher mound view.  When playing against the CPU, you can switch to a view from the pitcher's mound.  This isn't to be taken lightly.  Honestly, pitching from this perspective is the way it's meant to be.  Best is that you can easily distinguish a hitter's normal swing from their power swing from the mound view.   Batting Batting comes in a variety of forms.  Blue Shift added a few new batting options to the standard cursor button.  If you'd rather have timed hitting, for example, you can go that route.  Or you can try the Power Hitting option, which is a meter.  Swing when the meter is full for a more powerful swing.  This one's best left for the Big League Challenge.  Blue Shift also added a power swing button, which wasn't available last year.  Now you have a normal swing with A or a power swing with B.  This tends to lead to a few more homers than last year, but still within the range of your standard ballgame.  I was a power swing skeptic at first, but I've grown to accept it.  I'm still not the biggest fan, but since you can turn it off, I can deal.    My main gripe is that it's incredibly rare to hit home runs without using the power swing and that's just not baseball.  Sure, in the big leagues some batters come to the plate trying to swing for the fences, but most successful home run hitters will tell you that the harder they try to hit a home run, the more often they fail.  It's only by keeping the same swing as they would to get a screaming liner that they end up whacking balls out of the park.  But a normal swing will almost never result in a homer in WSB 2K3.  I can accept having a power swing when you absolutely want to try and crush it, but you should still be able to get home runs from a normal swing.  Even a pitcher, not trying to hit one yard, can get a homer from time to time.  It's just about timing and hitting the right pitch in the right spot.    Running the bases Baserunning uses standard baseball conventions, with the addition of a stop button (Y).  This lets you choose how far you want a runner to go on a pop fly.  The more you range, the more likely you can force a throw, which could go offline.  But, go too far and you may not make it back to the bag in time.  Sadly, there's no slide button and no way to choose to run over the catcher (though the AI will choose to have you do this sometimes).  How hard would it be to allow me to choose when to slide, whether to go head or feet-first, and what side of the bag to choose?  Now that's the kind of realism and control I can get behind.  On the other end, Blue Shift has managed to make base stealing a tense situation, something no other baseball game has ever really pulled off.  First, you can choose to manually steal a base, or you can simple press the desired base on the D-Pad and the merely give the baserunner the steal sign.  The computer will then choose when to steal the base.  What makes it so nerve-racking, is that you can't arbitrarily lead off from a base as you can in every single other baseball game released this year.  Baserunners take a default ~safe~ lead.  You can then increase this lead by up to two clicks of the left trigger.  Now in most games you would just push the baserunner as far from the base as possible.  But WSB 2K3 keeps you honest.  Because if you go too far, even just one click, the pitcher will look you back or throw to the base.  If you don't tap the left trigger fast, you will likely be picked off.      What this means in terms of gameplay, is that whenever you take a lead with any runner, you must constantly be on guard for a pickoff.  And a slower runner is much more likely to get picked off, meaning you can't have Mo Vaughn ranging out more than a few steps from the bag.    Unfortunately, you can't use this to your advantage when pitching against the computer.  The computer rarely ever takes extra steps, meaning most pickoff attempts aren't even close.  And, while you can look at a base with the left trigger, the runner will never react to your look back and retreat towards the base.  So, the benefits come only when at bat, which sucks a bit.  But, I actually dig this a bit more than the wall jump.  And the wall jumps are pretty freakin' cool.  A.I. A.I. problems, which sometimes plague baseball games, are pretty much a non-factor in World Series Baseball 2K3.  While the pitching-hitting battles aren't as realistic as High Heat, WSB 2K3 does a great job of making smart decisions.  You'll see batters intentionally walked at appropriate times, pitchouts, and even pitchers trying to throw carefully to big boppers.  More importantly, WSB's AI makes the right decision 99% of the time.  This means that with two outs and a ball grounded to the second baseman, he'll take the easiest out, which is usually at first.  He won't throw to second (as some games this year do) with a speedy runner heading to the bag who'll then often beat the throw, leaving everybody safe.   World Series Baseball 2K3 the most important thing a sports game can do:  The AI never screws you over.  WSB 2K3 also hampers your ability to cheat.  Growing up with games where you could always take advantage of numerous AI mistakes, my first couple dozen games of WSB 2K3 made me easy pickings.  The most consistent example, comes with fielding.  If you've got a speedy runner on first and, because you're an idiot, you decide to have the left fielder throw to first instead of to second or the cut-off man, the runner on first will go.  Every time.  And that's because in real baseball, you don't throw to first base when the runner's already there.  WSB 2K3 with its AI, fielding, and baserunning, will keep you honest.  However, baseball game veterans should beware.  Blue Shift has made the default settings pretty easy.  In fact, you can pretty much win the majority of your games on this setting.  Fortunately, there are a bunch of tunable options to make the game tougher.  And on harder settings, you'll definitely experience some realistic baseball.  And more importantly, some fun baseball.  MIA There are some things that were missing from last year's World Series Baseball that are still MIA.  There are scarcely any broken bats, passed balls, wild pitches, collisions at the plate, and other little things that happen a lot in baseball.  These things do happen in WSB 2K3, just not that often.  In fact, some of them are incredibly rare.  When compared with a game like High Heat, WSB 2K3 is grossly lacking in some of the little nuances that make baseball, well, baseball.  These things have got to be more prominent in the game.  How often do you see a game where there isn't a wild pitch or a broken bat?  In WSB 2K3 you might only see an event like this once every dozen games.  That's just not right.  Franchise The Franchise Mode remains the best in the biz.  And it's been so greatly improved that it makes last year's version seem hollow in comparison.  This is absolutely the best baseball Franchise Mode on the market and may very well be the best sports Franchise Mode period.  There's a lot of other companies already ripping off ast year's version, but Blue Shift and Sega still do it best.    Coaches Last year, Blue Shift had a great innovation.  They created scouts, managers, and coaches that had an affect not only on how player's progressed, but also how player skills were perceived.  This year, those coaches are back, but they can do even more.  Each team must have a Manager, Pitching Coach, Batting Coach, Minor League Manager, and Scout.  Each of these influences different aspects of the game.  A good pitching coach can help your pitchers reach their potential faster, for example.  And a scout, well, they're responsible for how you see every player's rating.  A bad scout might overrate or underrate players.  A great scout will be far more accurate.  This year, you can assign game aspects for each staff member to focus on.  For example, you can have the batting coach spend more time focusing on discipline instead of power.  If he's a good coach, your hitters will learn to become more patient at the plate through the course of the year.  There are a variety of options for each member of the staff, allowing you to truly work for your ~dream team~.      Coaches and managers can be fired mid-season if you don't care for their performance and free agent coaches must be hired to replace them.  Throughout the course of a season, you may see a team has fired a coach and if you want, you can let yours go in order to hire the recently displaced coach.    There are a few problems, though, with the coaching aspects of WSB 2K3.  First, when you start a Franchise you must draft coaches from a pool.  Now, if I'm not drafting all of my players, why should I have to draft coaches?  Why can't a sucky team start off with a sucky manager and a great team have a great manager?  I raise the point, because, good teams generally have a good staff in real life.  But if you start as the Yankees in WSB 2K3, you will almost certainly end up with one solid coach or manager and a bunch of mediocre and even bad remainders.  That's not the Yankees.  But in WSB 2K3 that's how it has to be.  The second problem is in direct connection with the first.  If you've had some success your first season and increased your budget, you can try and hire better coaches and managers during the offseason.  Problem is, you may have won the World Series, but since there are higher rated coaches to be had, you may fire your entire staff so you can get yourself some better-rated coaches.  That turns coaches into nothing more than a numbers racket.  And I don't think that's what Blue Shift intended.  My only other concern is that, at least in my eyes, it seems that no other team has any coaches, scouts, or managers.  When pulling off trades, it often seems very tough to steal away a player.  But honestly, that happens a couple times a year in baseball.  What would be even more impressive is if coaches had management styles.  This means that one manager might be a hit-and-run type and another might be the Earl Weaver ~three walks and a home run~ type.  Then you'd have to play against more than just the players, but also against how a team is managed.  What's more, you could set your own manager's options so that he managed the team a certain way when you simmed games.  A nice thought, but WSB 2K3 doesn't offer that much depth with its engine.  Fixing problems A lot of the problems with last year's Franchise Mode have been fixed to make for a much smoother ride.  Last year there seemed to be an endless number of trades.  This year, the trades have been toned down a bit.  It does still seem like more than in a normal season, but it's a lot more reasonable.    The sim numbers are even more accurate this year and player stats seem pretty spot-on.  There are still more pitchers winning over fifteen games a year than in real baseball, and a few too many players with high batting averages, but overall it's an improvement over last year and definitely close enough to the real thing to satisfy most baseball fans.  Rounding out the fixes, created players are no longer treated as lepers and can find themselves voted onto the All-Star team and can win awards like Rookie of the Year.  And the All-Star selection actually works this year, without its major bug of re-tallying results every time you try and look at the current vote total.  It's good not to have bugs.  Fatigue A new twist has been added to the old standard of simming through the weeks and months of a franchise.  WSB 2K3 features player fatigue.  This means that a catcher can't play 162 games of a season.  He'll wear himself out and likely get injured.  In fact, most players don't make it through all 162 games of a season without taking some rest.   When players get tired, they are at a greater risk of injury and lose some bat strength.  But fear not sim-lover.  You can set up a substitution ratio in the lineup menu, where you choose how often a player gets subbed.  So, if you have a catcher who tires quickly, you could sub him out 20% of the time.  Quite cool.    Stats Each year gamers cry out for deeper stat-tracking and each year game companies add more stats.  World Series Baseball 2K3 is no different, offering more stats than in the past, though not as many as High Heat.  Overall, it's quite a heft load of stats.  Trades Trades remain difficult to pull off.  You generally have to trade for somebody another team needs.  This year, money also becomes an issue.  If you offer a team a decent deal, they may ask you to kick in some extra cash.  But you can't make a trade and ask another team to give you a cash incentive.  In general, the trading is good, but it's too balanced towards the opposition.  News and information Though it doesn't sound like a big deal, I'll declare it now: World Series Baseball 2K3 offers an astounding amount of news and information about as efficiently and well-organized as possible.  It's easy to scan through news to see who's been traded, free agent activity, milestones and records, current streaks, coach firings and hirings, and various miscellany.  A slew of info that isn't daunting.  What's really great is being able to see notes about players when they are on a hitting streak or when a player reaches a milestone.  In real life, whether you're a fan of the Cubs or not, you'll know when Sammy Sosa hits his 500th homer.  Now, in WSB 2K3, you'll know it too.  Pretty cool.    Save me Perhaps the sweetest addition is the ability to save in the middle of a game.  How likely is it anyone can really play through a 162 game season without any simming?  Now you don't have to set aside a full hour to play a game, because you can save at any time and resume from the last completed half-inning.  Seasonal awards Lastly, Blue Shift added a good deal of seasonal awards.  As with last year, special team awards are handed out like the ~Thrifty~ award and ~Executive of the Year~, but standard player awards are now included.  You'll get the Cy Young Award, MVP, Rookie of the Year, Reliever of the Year, plus Gold Glove winners and Golden Slugger winners for both leagues.  The only negative is there's no trophy case to view all your accomplishments years down the line.  Lastly, Blue Shift finally set up a true Hall of Fame, where you can view all added members to the Hall whenever you want.  You can even see the percentage of votes they received to get into the hall.   I said it a few paragraphs ago and I'll say it again, WSB 2K3 has an awesome Franchise Mode that holds up throughout numerous seasons.  If Franchise Mode is your number one priority, look no further.  Presentation As I've said, WSB 2K3 is a fantastic game.  And perhaps I'm noting more flaws than I would in any other game.  But that's because Sega and Blue Shift are so close to gaming perfection, it becomes hard not to nit-pick.  But the problems with the in-game presentation, sadly, is not nitpicking at all.  It needs to be addressed, because it's not up to par with the rest of the game.  WSB 2K2 is easily the most complete baseball game I've ever played, but it's weak link is certainly the action replays and cut-scenes.  The action replays, which are automatic replays showing off great plays in the field, start way too late, usually at the very end of a play.  I want to see Torii Hunter tracking the ball to the wall and then leaping.  I don't want the replay to immediately cut to him in the air catching the ball.  Most double play replays begin with the second baseman right before he throws the ball to first.  Uh-uh.  Show me the whole play, just like they would on TV.  Also, the in-game cut scenes are, for the most part, regurgitated from last year.  Now, if you're a PS2 owner, these will all look new to you, sure, but there's no applause for recycling the same old stuff.    Beyond this, the stat overlays could be a lot more in-depth.  When Barry Bonds comes to the plate, I want to know his stats against left-handed pitchers.  How hard would it be to have stat overlays rotate?  Also, the scoreboards don't reflect accurate scores for other games being played or the game you're currently playing!  So much for the power of the Xbox.    On a more positive note, by pressing the white button while someone's at bat, you can check out a variety of cool info.  This includes seeing the ready status of your bullpen pitchers, the next few players in the lineup, and stats on runners on base.  You can also press A for last pitch, which is ESPN's Pitch Trax.  This shows the path of the last ball and where it crossed the plate in relation to a 3D strike zone.  Very cool and very hidden.  Why doesn't Pitch Trax pop up as a replay on close calls and strikeouts?    Another curious question arrises on this game aspect.  While you can see the status of your bullpen pitchers and can see stats for baserunners, you can't perform any substitutions from this menu.  Instead, you have to pause the game and use the pause menu.  WSB 2K3 has a serious problem with streamlining their menus and options.  There is a ton (no really, a ton) of cool stats and charts hiding within the WSB 2K3 menus, but I promise that many people will never even see them thanks to the poor menu layout.  Not to beat a dead horse, but there are also some stadium problems.  While WSB 2K3 added some really cool ballpark functionality (palm trees sway in the breeze in San Diego, the Big Apple pops up in Shea after a home run), I noticed one stadium that was not correctly modeled.  Granted, just about every stadium looks picture-perfect, but Qualcomm Stadium in my hometown of San Diego is missing its batter's eyes (the section of seats that must be closed off during games to give a batter an unobstructed view).  How do you miss a batter's eye?  It's required for every stadium.  While it's not a big deal, it honestly bugs me every game I play in San Diego.  The home run replays look great, however, and the new animations are fantastic, as is the inclusion of wall jumps and other gameplay goodies.  But overall, the presentation is not what it should be.  And what's really sad is that WSB 2K3 has probably the best in-game presentation of any of the baseball games released this year.    Graphics WSB 2K3 looks fantastic.  The level of detail, the real-time shadowing, the gorgeous stadiums, and the spectacular animations add up to a true visual treat.  The fabric on the unis looks as good as ever.  The player models are realistic, though there's little variance between a lean and overweight player.  The faces are good, with some players, like Ichiro, looking spot-on.    Tons of new animations have been added.  In fact, you'll see so many new animations in the infield, that it may be hard to spot the carry-overs from last year.  The double play animations look especially nice and there are only rare instances where animations look awkward (something that's been a problem for baseball games in the past).    Running with silky-smooth framerate, WSB 2K3 goes off without a visual hitch.  The sky looks gorgeous, the fields look lush, and the six unis per team are frightening and accurate.  If only the unis picked up dirt, like MVP.  On that similar line, it'd be nice if there was time progressing as far as lighting went, so that stadium shadows could creep over the field during day games.   I've already whined about the inaccuracies at the Q, but other than this the stadiums look right-on.  If only the crowds were stadium-specific, wearing unis for their teams.  But, they do look good compared to what else is out there.  But, still, the crowds just aren't what we've all wanted.  Not that the crowds really matter all that much.  Still, it'd be nice to see some advancement here by someone.  Maybe next year.  Sound Mike Krukow, last year's color man, is gone, having fled to another game.  In his place, Sega placed Angel's broadcaster Rex Hudler.  Hudler is a nut.  And his frenetic, off-the-cuff commentary adds an extra spark of life to WSB 2K3.  A definite step up from Krukow.  Ted Robinson returns for the play-by-play and does a fine job again this year.  WSB 2K3 does two important things correctly with their commentary: 1) It's accurate and reflects what's actually happening on the field.  2) It's sparse.  Many games try to go overboard with color commentary, but not WSB 2K3.  Hudler isn't constantly jabbering during the game.  But when you do hear the Hud, it stands out.  The player-specific taunts are back and better than before.  Many of last year's taunts have returned.  Get ready to hear people shouting at Jermaine Dye about his leg.  But there are some new taunts as well.   Making great use of 5.1 Dolby Digital, WSB 2K3 immerses you in the true stadium experience.  All that's needed now is player and coach voice and we're set for the most realistic ballpark experience ever.  In the gripe department, it would be nice to have customizable soundtrack use for player walk-ups.  Beyond that, WSB 2K3 continues Sega's tradition of excellent sound in sports. Blue Shift has outdone themselves.  At first glance, some may think this is just a rehash of last year.  But play WSB 2K3.  Play it a lot.  And you'll begin to see that subtle gameplay changes make this a better game then last year.  If you're wondering why the score is just a notch about the one given in 2002, it's for one simple reason.  World Series Baseball is an improvement over last season, but there are too many things Blue Shift didn't fix.  No balls bouncing in the infield? Come on now, that's gotta be there.  World Series Baseball 2K3 is the best console baseball game I've ever played.  If you love baseball, there is no other choice.  Buy WSB 2K3 and if you have some extra cash, think about one of the other ballgames as a backup -- something to play once in a while for giggles.  But set yourself aside a serious amount of time, because WSB 2K3 will take over your life for a good long while.  I only hope next year I can say the same thing about World Series Baseball 2K4.", "date": "Mar 10, 2003"}
