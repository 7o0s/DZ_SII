The point-and-click genre doesn't even register a heartbeat anymore, so bringing an old game from that genre to GBA is a risk.  Though the standard point-and-click interface has been altered to allow direct character control and icon-based selections, the operation is essentially the same.  So, the question is, can a game like this survive in today's market?  Survive, yes, but thrive?  Not likely.  Fortunately BAM and Revolution Software have managed to pull off an engrossing story with Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars.  While the genre won't likely be resurrected by this title, it will at least get a solid bang before it possibly disappears for good.   Features  A compelling story  Icon-based point-and-click action  More than 60 characters to interact with and over 70 locations to explore  Over a dozen hours of gameplay  Battery Save (Three slots)  Only for Game Boy Advance    The Story  A clown, a Paris cafe, a briefcase, an explosion.  This is how Broken Sword begins.  Concerned American citizen George Stobbart finds himself quickly drawn into an intricate mystery with mystical ties.  His journey to discover the reason behind the cafe bombing takes him across Europe in search of the truth.  With the help of a beautiful photographer, who has motives of her own, George uncovers a mystery far more complex than he could have ever imagined.  Yes, there's intrigue, betrayals, and surprises galore waiting for gamers willing to deal with a somewhat antiquated genre.   The Game  The point-and-click system has been modified for the GBA version of Broken Sword, allowing for direct character control.  Players move from one scene to the next, interacting with different objects or talking to other characters.  The controls are simple and easy enough to learn.  Most everything can be looked at and examined, but only important items can be picked up or manipulated.  As with any adventure game, the items you pick up will later be used in conjunction with another item or character.  There's not much mystery here, though, as to what to use and when.   When you chat with another character, you'll be presented with a list of icons, representing different characters or objects.  Select the icon you want to ask about to read George's question and the response.  This is a pretty simple system of elimination where you ask questions until you are all out of options.  Occasionally, though, a wrinkle is thrown in.  You may ask about, for example, a certain murderous clown and the other character will respond with a departing statement, leaving the scene before you can ask them your other questions.  This can be a bit frustrating and even nerve racking, because you want to know the answers to questions about other characters, but you've basically blown your chance by asking a question that caused them to leave.   The main strike against Broken Sword is that it's not really very difficult.  Most of the puzzles are simple to figure out and though you have some freedom to move from scene to scene, the game is primarily linear.  This title won't appeal to everyone.  In fact, it will probably turn a lot of gamers off.  The joy of playing Broken Sword (and it is a joy) is not in the gameplay, but in watching the story unfold.  It's essentially an interactive movie (or novel, since there's so much text), one that is highly involving.  And there is a lot of story here, easily over 10 hours of gameplay.  As much as I tried to resist, I could not stay away from the game.  The story hooked me and hooked me good.              Broken Sword makes great use of the GBA color palette.  Every scene is rich in color and dazzling eye candy.  Hand drawn and colored, there are some locales that will actually have you gawking.  And the scenery isn't static.  There are birds flapping their wings, cars passing on the street, and pedestrians working in the background.  Though some of the characters seem a bit stiff in their movements, your eyes will be too busy appreciating the environments to notice.  With so many characters and such a long story, it's important for characters to stand out visually as individuals.  And they do in Broken Sword.  Someone you meet early on is easily recognized eight hours into the game.  All around the visuals are a treat, which makes up in some small way for the gameplay limitations.  In the handheld world, it's easy to just expect arcade-like bings and bops for sound.  But Broken Sword goes beyond that, offering a solid score that carries throughout the game.  Mixed in are the sounds of the city, random chirps from birds, and even the rumble of an explosion.  Broken Sword may not be your game.  It's there for those who love a good story and some attractive surroundings.  It's not difficult or particularly challenging, but it will absolutely hook you.  The only thing compelling you to continue the game is your own desire to know what is going on and how the story will end.  There's some nice humor thrown in and the dialogue is surprisingly fresh at times.  However, if you are more into action games, platformers, or standard RPGs, this may not be for you.  This game is about as old-school PC as you can get, which I found refreshing.  Who knows, you may too.", "date": "Apr 9, 2002"}
