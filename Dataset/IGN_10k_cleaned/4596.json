Back in my days in Ohio, it was all about cheap beer and going to the local destruction derby to see the locals wreck their junkers even more. Well, the beer's not included, but Destruction Derby Arenas packs in a lot of cars running into each other, online even, and little else in terms of any other redeeming value. So keep on reading if that appeals to you, because it's the only cheap thrill in town for this game.   Gameplay  Destruction Derby Arenas is a budget title and everything about the game has a cheap and flimsy feel to it. The car physics feel very floaty, as if there's very little connection between the car and the road. The only things that work well enough are the collision between cars. Since this game is all about the destruction, there's plenty of it, but that's not enough for a whole game.    The maps are split between the arena brawls and the races. The arenas are the only places where Destruction Derby Arenas gets a decent footing since they feature the most action. A time limit is set and whoever gets the most points during that period wins. Power-ups like nitro boosts, quick fixes (in the shape of a floating wrench), and better handling can be picked up to do more damage to the other cars in the game. Points are given for the effect you have on other cars and not the damage.    This ~effect~ on other cars means that if you spin them 90, 180, 270 degrees or more or flip them or destroy them then you'll get points. Similarly, pull off some tricks like a jump off a ramp (fairly simple) or a barrel roll in the air (more difficult) and you'll score points as well. The only way to get points through damage alone is to strike the fatal blow and turn your opponent into a charred husk of a car.    Since this action depends on lots of cars being around, the arenas keep all of the cars in a limited area and keep the number of crashes high. This is where the cheap thrills come in with cars flipping and burning up all over the place. Jumping online, you can play with up to 20 people in an arena and enjoy it with others as well. The cars still feel light and the crashes don't have the satisfying crunch upon impact, but there's enough chaos to occupy an hour or two.   Each of the arenas has power-ups sprinkled around as well as plenty of oddball additions to shake things up, literally. Pistons pop out of the ground, edges of platforms fall away, and huge walls spin around to mash up contestants. This all creates some extra action, but rarely does it open up any new tactics for crushing opponents. The only level that drastically effects the gameplay is a horror movie-themed map that keeps the cars driving around on a platform that shrinks as chunks fall off of the sides.  Other than that, it's just about driving around fast and slamming into other cars. It's all fun for a bit, if you're into that kind of thing, but nothing that will last very long.     To make the game complete, some races were required and the driving is truly shown to be the dog that it is. The floaty driving makes navigating the tracks more of a chore than an exciting race. The only things that make the races bearable are the possibility of smashing into other cars. Other than that, the feeling is closer to San Francisco Rush than Gran Turismo. There are plenty of jumps and destructible territory to rip through in order to get an advantage in each race, even if there are few significant shortcuts to take.   Take away the possibility of crashing into other cars in the races and Destruction Derby Arenas is a meager attempt at a real game. Put it back in and it's a meager racing game with enhanced collision detection. The only advantage to playing through the races, which only takes an hour or so, is to unlock the extra cars and arena modes. Beyond that, it's best forgotten.    Graphics  There's no way around it, the cars look like toys, Micro Machines to be precise. In fact, every aspect of the graphics make Destruction Derby Arenas look like it was designed by high-schoolers. The loading screens for the races feature character drawings that must have been submitted by a first-year art student that is still stuck on creating massive mammaries on all the women.    As for the graphics in the game, Destruction Derby Arenas has the look and feel of a PS One game. The cars and the environment are low in polygons and all of the textures are flat and low-detail. Even with all of this, the graphics are extra shimmery with aliasing all over the place. As for the camera, it generally does a fair job of keeping the car on the screen. When it gets near walls, especially in arena matches, it can freak out and fly all around. Unless you're playing in first-person mode, it's very difficult to line up the next target.    Sound  Destruction Derby Arenas is all about the visuals of the cars crashing. You're definitely not going to be staying around for the heavy metal soundtrack full of generic tunes. And there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the announcers colorful commentary will keep you tuned in either. Overall, the audio is mediocre at best and is better ignored in favor of just trying to get more points from the crashes.  Destruction Derby Arenas handles the arena smash-'em-up situations adequately well with some car crashes that can be fun for an hour or so. Playing online will provide another hour of smashing fun. Beyond that, the well quickly runs dry and the races leave practically everything to be desired. If you really, really, really, want to see cars collide, play Driver. If you're still not satisfied, this might be amusing for an afternoon.", "date": "Mar 30, 2004"}
