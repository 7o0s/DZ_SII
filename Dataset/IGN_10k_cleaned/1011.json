Sure we'd all like an extra limb, but at what price? Are we ready to combat the unending stream of mutants sure to rise out of the sewers of major urban cities after years of our dangerous testing? Sure we are, as long as we've got the Genohunters from Evolva to help out.  Evolva is equal parts team-based shooter and scientific experiment. Your job is to rid a planet of a foreign, mutating life form that is quickly destroying the natural flora and fauna that currently exist on it. But you're a little too civilized to actually get your own hands dirty -- in the future, you've got the power of genetics to keep things a little less messy. In fact, you've got four different powers at your disposal in the form of different Genohunters, each with a different advantage. While each character is pre-disposed to strength, speed, intelligence and agility, while on your journeys you'll have many opportunities to change their attributes, add special abilities, or specialize to your heart's content. It's a great concept, especially when paired with the squad-based control you have over the team.  The game is separated into missions, with sub-objectives for each level. Usually it's a matter of gaining the abilities to get through the level, but you'll also have to do things like combine different plants to create specific explosions, or defend the natural fauna from invading creatures. While you'll be spending a lot of time exploring, the bulk of your time will be spent on killing everything that moves (and we mean everything), taking it's genetic material, and then using it to add to your attributes. The mutation screen makes all of this a simple process by showing you two different branches for your selected Genohunter, and the effects of the mutation on your stats. Because you can't tweak each stat individually, it means that sometimes you'll want to wait before making a mutation, until you can get enough genetic material together to change the stats in a more appealing way. At special points in the missions, you'll also come into contact with new life forms with special abilities -- survive their attacks, pummel them into chewable meat products, and you'll gain yourself a brand new ability, such as fire breathing or shields. You may not want all your characters to gain all of the abilities available however, depending on how focused you want them on specific skills -- a shield may be a great addition to a character's stats, but not if it halves its speed.  While the concepts behind the game are pretty wild and woolly, when you get into the level-by-level structure of the game, it's straightforward to the point of tedium. You'll plop down into a level, and your objective is to get from point A to B, for the most part -- but where most shooters make the exploration the focus of the fun, Evolva lacks the eyeball appeal of games like Soldier of Fortune, or Rainbow Six. The game has an organic, uniform look to the world and it's inhabitants, so while it's impressive for the first few levels, you'll quickly tire of the unending terrain, the round tunnels, and the rock blockages that are around every corner. You know what to expect for the most part, and the game becomes a matter of killing the onslaught of creatures that lurk waiting for in order to complete the next mission objective.  Most of the terrain is open and spacious, so you'll be doing a lot of circle-strafing and back peddling as you try to kill the endless stream of creatures that the game throws at you. During the early levels, where your weapon options are limited, you're stuck attacking creature after creature for what seems like ages, only to deal with yet another troop only a few meters later. The game will throw small puzzles at you, or spicier objectives, but you'll spend 90% of your time just trying to get through the next wave of aliens. Because the weapons don't have the punch of games like Quake, you don't get nearly the amount of satisfaction that you would in a standard shooter.  And because killing is so tied in with the mission objectives, you're not even allowed to simply ditch enemies as you would in a standard shooter, but you've got to just slug away at them in order to complete an objective. Even with four characters, and the ability to evolve, the game becomes a sort of alien Double Dragon -- fun at first, but a game that quickly turns repetitive.  The team interface is what was designed to give you more options in battle, and to take the game another step in a new direction. For the most part it works effortlessly, allowing you to have the team follow the current character in your control, or use a simple key command, follow your mouse target to attack an enemy, pick up an item, or gather some genetic material. Most of the time you'll ignore the commands and have the characters simply follow you, even if it means running through an alien mine field, because having to actually guide them would be that much more annoying. Still after playing a few days of Vampire, you'll have to admit that the Evolva team did a pretty good job of getting your sidekicks to actually do what you want most of the time. But does it work? Sorta. It's great to have specialized team members, but the levels are rarely designed to capitalize on their unique characteristics. Perhaps it's because of the pure customizability of your characters that the designers couldn't create unit-specific tasks for areas, but it would have been nice to feel like each member was useful for more than just popping aliens.  The multiplayer is in stride with most multiplayer add-ons nowadays, which means that it's a few minutes of fun, but nothing that you'll sink your teeth into for the long run -- especially given that you can't jump onto Internet games. It's nice that you can put your own characters into the game, but it doesn't seem to effect the way multiplayer games turn out all that differently, especially if you're playing against a smart opponent.  The graphics, as I mentioned earlier, are crisp, creepy, and completely original. They're also very, very similar to one another, so similar in fact that you'll have a hard time deciphering what's alien and what's scenery at times. Like with Quake, the color palette stays in a very small range, which for some might not be such a big deal, but for me, it just added to the general monotony. The music is a nice ambient score, with some interesting bleeps and bloops that you wouldn't normally hear in a video game. The sound design is just as strong, with some truly creepy sounds, especially the flame-breathing, pig-squealing spider things. Soul Reaver pulled similar creepy audio tricks, and they were just as effective -- but Evolva's weird character design has the insanity to back it up.  Evolva is far from a bad game, and I'd almost tell you that it's worth playing just to check out some of the great new features it adds to the gaming rulebook. But unfortunately, besides the nice loop, and that first drop at the beginning, the ride is nowhere near as exciting as you'd hope it would be. The ideas are fresh, but the execution just doesn't match the initial ingenuity. Just keep working on that three-headed cat-rat in your basement, and you'll be happy.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
