No matter what we say otherwise, deep down in our hearts, we hate having to review RPGs.  We liked RPGs once, a long time ago, but not any more.  The first time we had to play one under deadline, investing forty-odd hours of our own time, we developed an implacable hatred of the entire genre and all that it represents.  Another boss?  Another dungeon?  Another unending talking-heads sequence?  How long, O Lord, how long?  Okay, I'm getting a little out of hand here.  I still love to play RPGs, and I always will.  Why else would I have spent so much time with Chrono Cross, Valkyrie Profile, and Legend of Mana?  But this issue sticks in my mind because I'm bothered by my reaction to Legend of Dragoon.  I was assuming that I would like it a good deal more than I actually did, and I'm worried that it's somehow my fault, that I'm letting aggravation cloud my judgment.  Despite my high expectations, it breaks the streak of quality in four-disc console RPGs, the realm of hugeness formerly occupied only by Square's amazing Final Fantasy VIII and Sega's awe-inspiring Panzer Dragoon Saga.  It's a little silly to directly compare Dragoon to those games just because they happen to have a particular amount of disc space in common, but even viewed on its own terms, even taking into account the ire that invariably fills a tired reviewer in the grip of a game he doesn't like, I don't believe Legend of Dragoon lands anywhere much higher than ~above average.~  It's a fine production as far as its visuals are concerned, but the combat system, story, and character development leave the graphics trudging about on a set of awfully weak legs.  It's a pity, because Legend of Dragoon looks as good as any RPG in this particular mold (pre-rendered backgrounds, realtime characters and battles).  It's a little sparse in the eye-candy department in its earlier movements, but once it settles in around the beginning of the second disk, you'll encounter some exceptionally imaginative backgrounds and settings, filled with detail and well-done animation, like running rivers and waterfalls.  The towns and dungeons are carefully drawn, and more than that they're intricately designed.  It's neat to wander around and see how the cities fit together, moving from room to roof to catwalk - it adds a little more spice to the casual home invasion that's somehow become an integral part of the RPG genre.  Another element you have to work your way towards are the CG movie sequences.  It's a little odd that they're being pushed as such a major selling point of the game, because while they're unbelievably good once you find them - imagine Panzer Saga's dragon designs with Square- or Namco-quality execution - the first of the really impressive clips doesn't appear until around the fifteen-hour mark.  To balance this out a little, there are some pretty nice cinematic sequences done with a modified version of the realtime battle engine.  It's not Metal Gear, but it's not bad.  It's too bad that the visuals don't really crank up in the early going, because that leaves little to buoy a story that failed to grab my attention.  Legend of Dragoon doesn't serve up a great deal in the way of plot or character that I found very original or interesting.  To the degree that they are fleshed out at all, the cast moves in fairly predictable directions - Dart, the hero, is that and little more, and he receives the most screen time by far.  Rose, the female lead, is a bit more interesting, but I had the major revelation about her character pegged well in advance, and once revealed, its potential doesn't seem to be explored anywhere near as deeply as it could have been.  Speaking of revelations, there was actually only one that I didn't get a handle on, and I felt a little foolish afterward - it's a simple application of the Law of Economy of Characters in conjunction with the Law of...um...something involving villain deaths, I don't remember anymore.  Anyway, I'd be interested to know if anyone else had it sussed before I did.   How much of the story's problems can be attributed to the original designers, I can't tell.  Yep, you know why.  No two ways about it: this is not quality translation, although my impression was that it improved slightly later in the game. Large portions of the dialogue employ syntax and colloquialisms that no human would ever contemplate.  There are typos, transposed words, voice clips that gave me flashbacks to Shining Force III, and at least one FF Tactics-esque discrepancy between translations of the same term (~Flurry of Styx~ or ~Ferry of Styx~ - pick one, guys).  Square seems to have learned the lesson, and I hope Sony will someday as well - it is hard as hell to connect emotionally with characters who speak this way.  Combine this with the story's very slow development - the plot doesn't really go anywhere very interesting for fifteen or twenty hours - and you get a script that's a struggle to endure in the early going.  The voice-acting proper is actually pretty well-done (the dubbed dialogue in the cinemas, as opposed to the dubbed battle-cries in the combat sequences), but there's so little of it, it can't come close to overcoming the weakness of the written dialogue.  Can you let the story take a backseat and enjoy the gameplay?  Hm.  The combat system's fundamental elements are Additions, chain combinations that you activate with well-timed button presses.  A square target indicator zeroes onto your enemy with each strike, and if you tap the X button at the moment it centers, your attack is stretched out with an additional hit.  Good idea?  Yes and no.  Early on, it's more or less the same as using the Gunblade in Final Fantasy VIII.  Your first Additions only have one extra stage, and completing the combo isn't usually necessary to defeat most opponents.  It's just a neat little twitchy element to expand the variety of combat a litte.  As the game goes on, though, the system wears out its welcome.  The later Additions, which you learn from experience, have four, five, and six hits, often arranged in a tricky syncopated rhythm, and you have to learn them, develop them, and hit them every time to deal enough damage against the more powerful bosses.  By about twenty hours in, I was dead sick of having to play Parappa during every battle.  The other conspicuous feature of combat is Dragoon Transformation, and the spells and special attacks that accompany your neato sentai transformation into a winged, armored master of dragons.  At certain points in the game, your characters acquire Dragoon Spirits, allowing them to transform into Dragoons.  The transformation is powered by Spirit Points, which you earn by connecting with more (and more powerful) regular attacks.  Once you transform, you can execute Dragoon Attacks, a variation on your ordinary combos based on a similar sort of timed button-tappping, or Dragoon Magic, the fun part, a set of powerful offensive and defensive spells.  The trouble with the transformation system is that while it looks dang cool, it isn't necessarily all that useful.  Dragoon Attacks are frequently no more or less powerful than your standard combo attacks, and attack spells are generally overkill for ordinary combat.  There doesn't seem much point in bothering with the transformation and lengthy attack animations outside of boss battles, and so transformation is generally reserved for the occasional powerful enemy, when the extra defense of your Dragoon Armor is a significant advantage.  The vast majority of battles consist of simply repeating Addition attacks, with occasional breaks to use healing items or attack spells, but despite the monotony, you actually have to concentrate fairly closely to use the Additions effectively.  There are other, more minor design issues that get up my nose.  For example, random encounters.  It's the final and clinching proof that I am no longer hardcore, but I am losing my patience with the random encounters.  I recognize them as a necessary game element, but I also submit that a game ought not inflict them upon me more than is absolutely required.  For example, when I've gone all the way through the dungeon and finished off the long, tedious boss fight, a game should be kind enough not to make me hike back out of the dungeon and back home to the castle or town or whatever, battling random monsters all the way.  It should, instead, be kind enough to return me to my destination, or move me forward onto a new leg of the plot.  Legend of Dragoon, unfortunately, is not quite so kind.  My third or fourth unnecessary hike through the Home of Gigantos, the Barrens, and the Valley of Corrupted Gravity was not an enjoyable experience.  Comments: Perhaps I'm getting old.  Perhaps I'm biased.  Perhaps Legend of Mana just spoiled me rotten.  I don't know.  But I can't escape the fact that despite Legend of Dragoon's undeniably laudable qualities, its lovely feats of computer graphics and its excellent displays of 3D pyrotechnics, a story that develops well in its very final chapters, as well one or two music tracks that I grew very fond of indeed (the soundtrack does some interesting things with light Middle Eastern rhythms), I did not have the best of times with it.  Maybe someone with a little more time to sit back and appreciate it, breaking it up over a series of shorter play sessions, might enjoy it.  They might just as easily lose interest entirely, though.  It has ambitions to be the next great cinematic RPG, but it never seems to quite grow the wings that would let it take off and soar like its other four-disk brethren.  -- David Smith", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
