People were starting to get a touch tired of the linear paths of King's Quest and Leisure Suit Larry and were thrilled by the new game's three-way play option. Even so, as time wore on, the genre started to loose its popularity and sales weren't quite as strong as they'd been in the old days. Even so, Quest for Glory managed to sell enough units in each of its iterations to warrant three sequels to the original game. Each boasted the same RPG feel while staying fairly true to the classic get item A and carry it to person B feel. Now Sierra is attempting to give the ailing genre a shot in the arm by bringing the series into the 3D age. Unfortunately, the end result doesn't work out quite as nicely as it could have.  Quest for Glory V's storyline is much as you'd expect it. The king of Silmaria has been assassinated, and the kingdom is in trouble. After poking around the main city a bit (and running into several friends from your past adventures) you'll discover that the new king is being selected by a process known as the Rite of Rulership. Five entries are given five great quests to complete and the overall winner is proclaimed king. Obviously you join in and the adventure begins. The quests are extremely dangerous and to make matters worse, that assassin is still out there trying to pick off candidates. In order to survive, you've got to be quick, or smart, or strong. Although the tale starts off a little hokey, if you're like me, it won't take but about an hour before you're sucked into the story and continue play simply to see what happens next.  As in the earlier Quest for Glory titles, you've got the choice between playing a fighter, a thief or a wizard character, each of which have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. While the fighter is very strong, and can use a large variety of different weapons and armor, the thief can pick locks and use his acrobatic skills to get into places he's not supposed to be, and the wizard has the power of magic at his command. All of the puzzles in the game are designed to be confronted differently by different characters. A warrior will most often find it easiest to just over-power foes, a wizard to use his magic to change the odds of a situation into his favor, and the thief will do best to figure out a way to just avoid the problem all together. The end result, as with most of the games in the series, is pretty entertaining, and doesn't hit you with that post-game depression that finishing most adventure titles leave at their completion.  The graphics this time around are spectacular. Quest for Glory fans will love getting a chance to see their old favorites displayed with such sharp color and in 3D fashion. The screens are animated everywhere it seems, trees sway in the wind, water laps on the shore, townspeople go through the motions of their job. The enemies in the game seem well thought out and well designed, and more than once I actually felt myself getting a touch creeped out. It's obvious (from both this game and the new King's Quest) that Sierra has been spending some serious time lately on their art production, and it finally seems to be paying off.  The game's sound is a mixed bag. Although I found the soundtrack and effects to be nice (although nothing to write home about), the voice acting in this game is just plain bad. Each of the different characters in the game has a different accent which were not only predictable and mildly insulting (the rug merchant has an Indian accent, the blacksmith growls at you, and the scientists sound like they just wandered off the Revenge of the Nerds set), but also just plain bad. In the end, you'll probably find yourself just clicking through the messages to avoid having to listen to the characters talk.  But it's not the voices that make this game so frustrating, it's the horrible perspectives and irritating combat system. As long as you're playing through the adventure portions of the game, everything's fine. Just point and click and you'll get where you're going without too much trouble. Once you get into a fight though, you're screwed. The main trouble is that Quest for Glory can never seem to make up its mind (at least during the combat sequences) whether it's an action game or an adventure game. Let me explain  if you point at an enemy with your mouse and double click, your character will stomp over and take a quick swipe at them with whatever weapon you happen to be carrying at the time  a simple, but effective system. Unfortunately, because enemy characters tend to dance around, you must use your arrow keys to make adjustments to your facing, in order to defend yourself, you need to cover the shield block key, and finally, in order to use your overhand smash option, you also have to cover the key for that as well. What ends up happening is that you need one hand to hold the mouse, one to work on the arrow keys, and a third hand to cover your combat options. I discovered after several losses that I don't have nearly that many hands. While all of this would be bad enough in its own right, many of these battle take place behind objects or so far away from your perspective, that you can't see what direction you're facing or how close you are to an enemy. If you're anything like me, after about your third battle you'll be ready to throw the game out of the nearest window.  In addition to the frustrating combat system, Quest for Glory V also has a few other quirks that ruin a great deal of the good in the game. The game's insistence that characters feed themselves every few hours will often cause you to die in your sleep from hunger during the first few hours of play. Even if you do get the hang of feeding your character regularly, you'll be in danger from the game's ominous crash bug that would send me out to Windows with no warning whatsoever. These are both issues that should have been picked up in bug testing and fixed before the game shipped.  In the end, Quest for Glory V is a good looking adventure game with an excellent storyline and laudable replay value that suffers a great deal due to a few really annoying play features. If you're a big fan of the series, you may want to brave the game's quirks and just save every few seconds in order to find out what happens to your old friends in this installment of the game. If you're new to the genre though, you may find that Quest for Glory's negatives make the game a little bit closer to work than fun.  -- Trent C.Ward", "date": "Dec 22, 1998"}
