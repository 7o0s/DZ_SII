{"name": "Digimon World", "name_review": "Digimon World", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/06/digimon-world", "text": "Published by Bandai, Digimon World is the latest attempt by a company to cash in on the success and general popularity of the entire virtual pet and monster collection phenomenon that has brainwashed kids across the world into thinking that they really have to catch them all. If you're a parent whose child is amongst the collective and are looking for someone to blame or to direct some anger towards, then you might want to direct some towards Bandai, whose Tamagotchi could be seen as the source of all this mayhem.   On the other hand, if you're one of the many hordes of children from across the globe that thinks that this stuff is the best thing since the start of Britney Spears' singing career, then you probably have nothing but love for company's like Bandai and will probably snap up this game regardless of the wondrous text that's soon to follow.     Gameplay  Kicking it old school style, Digimon World attempts to bring the phenomenon back to its roots as it is generally aimed towards the raising and nurturing of these creatures rather than the pure collecting and training that other games seem to have leaned towards. Throughout the game, players will have to keep a close eye on their monsters, keeping it fed when it's hungry, letting it sleep when it's tired, and pretty much doing everything that's needed to raise a real-life pet and/or child.   Everything about the game really revolves around nurturing your pet and making sure that each and every need of it is fully taken care of. It's very important to praise it when it does something good and punish it when it misbehaves. In addition to the constant management of your pet, the other main ingredient in the game comes in the way of recurrent battles with other Digimon creatures. While there are numerous options that are available to you when taking care of your Digimon, the options are actually quite limited in the battles. Players are only given a few control options and can only really interact in the battles by throwing in power-up items and calling on the creature's special attack when the time comes.   More often than not, the game's battles will make the user feel like he or she is a spectator rather than one of the participants. If one is in the mindset that they're simply trainers and their pet's success is a result of its superlative training, then being victorious in battles can be quite rewarding. Otherwise, they might just feel a bit unfulfilled.   Graphics  Overall, the game's graphics aren't really too shabby. While the textures aren't really that detailed, the game's backgrounds and character models are made up of extremely vibrant colors and clean polygons. There's nothing revolutionary being done here, the character animation leaves a lot to be desired, and it definitely won't make you say anything like, ~I can't believe that they did this on PlayStation~, but it still can be classified as a good looking videogame.   Sound  Needless to say, most of the game's audio is overly cute. Everything from the voices to the various sound effects and background noises and to the game's musical soundtrack is all very cutesy, which is pretty much a perfect fit for this type of game. The only real downer is that the music is pretty unnoticeable and the music that you do hear doesn't have any memorable qualities.  If you're not a fan of Digimon, there's nothing about this game that'll make you change your mind. If you're a big fan of Digimon, then there's probably nothing that I can say to change your mind here -- just go out and make your parents buy this game and every single plush toy that they can afford.", "date": "Jul 6, 2000"}
