{"name": "Ka-52 Team Alligator", "name_review": "Ka-52 Team Alligator", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/01/ka-52-team-alligator", "text": "Fans of Simis' last offering to the helicopter simulation world, Team Apache, have probably had their eyes focused in on this one for quite awhile.  The installment promised a newer, meatier engine called Daedalus (big poppa to the Icarus engine of days gone by), and fine tuned gameplay from the original.  There were to be slicker graphics, smoother animations, weather effects, and other improvements that are honestly expected in any sequel of this genre.  While KA52 hits most of these targets, some other areas seem to have been left behind during mission planning.  Getting acquainted with Team Alligator, pilots are faced with the formidable KA52 Russian attack helicopter.  This double-rotor aircraft looks just as mean as it is, showcasing an array of hard-hitting weapons certain to ruin the afternoon of anyone caught in their path.  Gamers take the position of pilot in this two-seater, with the job of weapons officer falling to the computer.  Don't worry, you still get to blow things up, and its far easier to just have to concentrate on flying rather than having to paint laser dots on targets at the same time.  At the onset, players will have their choice over four different game modes.  First and foremost come the Training missions, which are highly recommended for newbies and veterans alike.  The six missions come equipped with a full-fledged Russian voice-over to help guide you through everything from starting the engine to taking out enemy targets at the live fire range.  Once having gained at least a little confidence in the pilot's seat, players can move on to the Instant Action, Combat Missions, or Campaign modes of play.  Instant Action is just what it sounds like, getting you into the thick of it with a minimum of preparation.  You'll fly around taking out a never-ending stream of bogies until you quit or are sent to the pavement in a blazing pile of rubble.  For those with a bit more direction in life than that, the Combat Missions are more structured.  These tasks have specific objectives to complete, and therefore actually have a defined way to win (go figure).  Last but not least is the Campaign mode, which is where the majority of players will spend their time.  Choosing either the Belarus or Tajikistan versions (with the latter being a bit easier), gamers will be in charge of absolutely everything.  You'll plan the missions, choose your equipment, select and promote personnel, and of course, command the onslaught.  Recognizing the achievements of those who flock to your banner is also required, as this improves the moral of your troops and ultimately their performance.    Combined with the multiplayer option for you and up to seven friends, things are shaping up pretty good to this point.  Then you get into the actual game, and things start to fall apart a bit.  As previously stated, it's a good idea to start off in the Training mode, regardless of your personal experience when it comes to sims of this type.  This is largely due to the odd physics model of KA52.  Granted, the goal during development of this title was to merge the hardcore simulator fans of the world with those whose only reason for even being in the cockpit was because that's where the fire button is located.  However, it seems that just a bit too much was shaved off of the realism to accommodate the latter audience.  A simply horrid amount of dead zone seems to exist when trying to fly this heap.  Other copters have a lot of leeway between horizon level and a sharp turn, but the KA52 must not if the physics are on track here.  It's quite annoying when you're attempting to make a minute adjustment in flight path only to see the aircraft bank to the side as if being pulled by some sort of invisible tether.  Plus, things get most unpleasant when you find yourself flying low to the ground (which is quite necessary in some missions I might add) and then begin to drift down towards it.  One might think that a minor correction could bring the helo back to center, but instead a vast amount of what seems like an overcorrection is required to avoid planting the nose ten feet into the soil.  Also interesting, though really only a factor in Training, is the pause function.  While attempting to master the awkward controls of this title in the game's tutorial, my phone rang and interrupted the frustration.  Tapping Ctrl+P to pause the game, I got up from my desk and discovered that the Russian instructor was still chattering away.  Now, I may not be an expert helicopter pilot, but I am certainly a gamer of some renowned experience.  It is my understanding that a pause function is generally utilized when it is necessary to direct one's attention away from the game.  The gamer should not be required to look at or listen to anything going on at that point, otherwise attention is still required and the reason for trying to stop the action becomes moot.  Therefore, playing out the entirety of a field instruction (in helicopter maneuvering of all things) after the recipient of said instruction has paused the game and is out of the room seems just a bit odd don't you think?  My personal professor of avionics actually started to get ticked that I wasn't following his orders, even though I couldn't possibly do that since the game was 'stopped' at that point.  Fascinating.  If you can get over the strange physics, and are fortunate enough to get through the tutorial without interference from the outside world, you'll have some time to notice that the graphics in Team Alligator are actually quite well done.  Even up close the building and tank models are convincing, and only a small amount of blur is apparent in the distance.  Just don't crash though, since the shot of your downed 'copter is largely unsatisfying.  You'd think that crushing millions of dollars in Russian technology would look cooler, but oh well.  Also ironic is the fact that you'll have plenty of time to check out all of these images, since your helicopter appears to be unable to outpace a snail with a cement block in tow.  Any individuals out there hoping to glide along a canyon floor at breakneck speed in their vehicle should stick to watching Firefox and Episode One.  Though perhaps lending somewhat to the simulation aspect of helo flight, any notions of intense firefights with blindingly quick maneuvers are sure to leave some disappointment in their wake.  Even taking these flaws into consideration, Team Alligator probably still has enough muscle left in its engines to offer contentment for some sim fans in our midst.  The missions are challenging, explosions are satisfying, and the overall visuals are certainly better than the average bear.  Adding to that the option to join up with others around the world to wreak havoc on opposing forces and you've got a decent effort here.  However, it seems as though KA52 could use a little time in the repair bay if it wishes to join the ranks of the truly elite.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Jun 1, 2000"}
