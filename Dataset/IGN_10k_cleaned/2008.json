The genre quickly became popular thanks to Acclaim's Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 on PlayStation, but it followed with some of the worst racing that's ever been flailed upon a system. MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael hasn't sparked my IGN colleagues' imaginations much, but then nobody, including myself, particularly likes motocross too much here.   I've been playing this game for months, and despite my total lack of interest in the sport, I truly enjoy this game. MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a unique arcade motorcycle racer packing a powerful 3D engine, some tough enemy AI, and a wide variety of courses that'll make you work for first place. Built right into the core of the game is a strong sense of control that's particular to motocross -- quick acceleration, little top speed, instant control, and, relatively new to the motocross videogames, a flexible trick system. Personally, I feel that this game is better than just a good motocross game: It's a very good racer that's true to the sport and that re-creates the freestyle aspect of the sport better than any other prior to it.    Gameplay From the deep control to the continued license of Ricky Carmichael (and happily for THQ, Ricky just keeps winning) to the solid AI and balanced courses, Pacific Coast Power and Light has created a very well rounded game. PCP&L has developed a brand new 3D engine for this game on PlayStation 2 that's wonderfully robust. It renders large in-door and out-door arenas without pop-up, keeps the frame rate consistent, and maintains as many as eight riders on screen at any time. But the game wouldn't be worth two rusted spokes without delivering precise control. Based in the arcade school of motocross, MX 2002 is easy to pick up and play, but after a few levels, it's neither terribly simple nor is it very forgiving.   You see, the bikes are easily accessible at first. Players are given the standard controls -- brake, gas, turn, etc., and the courses start off with long straight-aways and some fun, big jumps. You can pass through the first few levels by just driving well. All of the riders in this game pack a great sense of control, regardless of the selected bike. With a slight twitch of the handle, bikes can carve out huge swaths of dirt, and can just as easily peel out or worse, stall on a tight turn. Power slides and wheelies are easily generated with these remarkably responsive bikes, too. Still, there is a need to learn new skills here. If you decide to progress through the Career mode, a tutorial teaches players to learn a few key controls that make the difference right away. Quite quickly, players will notice that learning to use the pre-loads and throttle are key to winning any kind of race at all.   Although introduced in ATV Off Road Fury, the preload concept was in MX 2002 long before that game was on retail shelves, maintains Dennis Harper, PCP&L Vice President of product development. The pre-load is a natural trick that's made its way to videogames, and it's just as apparent in real life motocross as it is in ATV racing. With the preload, Riders crouch and build up momentum while launching off a ramp or hill, and then they extend while in air, delivering a smooth transition and a burst in speed to the jump. In MX 2002, the preload is key. Adding to this more sophisticated technique is the mastery of the throttle. Using the throttle off a jump, when one lands, and coming out of a slow turn, timely use of the throttle spins your wheels faster then normal, generating an additional burst of speed.   With the control techniques mastered, players can then get into the other half of the game, the tricks and combos. Although nowhere nearly as control savvy as Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 or 3, THQ's MX 2002 is one of the first full-fledged trick-based motocross game that handles tricks worth their weight in salt. Yeah, I know, Excitebike 64 was many people's favorite, but it wasn't mine. I never got into it, never liked it all that much despite its great physics and great sim qualities. What's cool about the whole trick system in MX 2002 is that once you learn it, tricks can be pulled off in straight racing competitions or in freestyle events. It's not two different systems; it's one coherent whole.   Stunts are also easy to pull off, and ironically, less difficult to master than winning races. Press down on R2 or L2 while in air, and then press any of the X, Square, Circle, or triangle buttons, or a combination of these, and up to 28-plus tricks. Players can spin the bike for a 360, or push forward for a forward loop, or pull backward for a loop. Players can pull off three, four, even five tricks in a row. PCP&L has set up a bunch of freestyle courses with great variations in mini-games such as bus jumps, trick-based arenas, and courses that promote exploration and experimentation. Nearly every time you win another course in Career mode, another new freestyle course opens up.   In all, I liked the control. The bikes are light and squirrelly, and they respond instantly. The basis of the control is rooted in the arcades, but the level of competition, and the difficulty of the courses combines for a very realistic kind of play that brings the notion of arcade to another level. MX 2002 is a great hybrid that fuses both the forgiving coin-op and real-life simulation sensibilities quite well. Still, for those who like the more simulation style of game, best represented in Excitebike 64, they may not like this too much. I believe that the controls and levels are good enough to warrant their attention, but because it's motocross, few of the Nintendo guys here have given much time to this game despite the many times I have asked them to. They don't know what they're missing (but that's another story).   With that, I should mention the way in which MX 2002 is set up. Players have access to Exhibition, Freestyle, and Career mode from the get-go. Players can also go head-to-head in a two-player mode. What's nice about the menus is their graphic presentation and the automatic save system. Players select a rider, who appears on screen, and in Career mode, they have a choice of picking goggles, helmet, shirt, boots, bike, and a team. Additionally, players can select a name and a number that instantly show up on the biker's jersey and on the bike. Players can choose from three different camera perspectives -- close, medium close, and far away. There is no first-person perspective here.   For the most part, the menus are great, but there are some niggling areas I didn't like. From what I can tell, I can't rename my rider once he's named. Second, I can't go back and play the courses in the calendar once I have beaten them -- sure I can play them in Exhibition, but hey, why can't I just go back and play that other course? It's a videogame. Third, the calendar isn't so much of a calendar as it is a rigid slate. Not only can't I go back and play -- or even see the courses I played -- I can't go forward in the calendar (which kinda ruins the whole definition of a ~calendar~ itself) to see what race is coming up. Also, I really wished there was a restart option in the middle of the race. Instead, having to quit to menu and then choose the level and do all that over again is a pain. Just give me Restart! Ah well, such is life -- but those would have been easy little additions to create an ever better sense of control over your cycle career.    As with all of the other Ricky Carmichael games, this one is loaded with licenses. First of all, there's the exclusive use of four-time AMA National Champion and 2001 Supercross Champion himself, Mr. Carmichael. Along with Ricky are 30 extra riders, from the 125cc and 250cc and freestyle ranks, including Mike Larocco, Kevin Windham, Ezra Lusk, Carey Hart, Trevor Vines, Mike Jones, and James ~Bubba~ Stewart. The game mixes up real with imaginary courses, and while I hated the real ones at first, I came to like them because of their toughness, and their tried-and-true originality. The motocross, supercross, amateur, and freestyle tracks are all well balanced -- and include Loretta Lynn's Amateur National Championships, the Chevy Trucks US Motocross Championships, the Free Ride Moto-X Championships, and even the THQ Open. In all, there are 22 courses.   Perhaps the most wonderful/annoying aspect of the game is the AI riders. These guys muscle you out of the picture, force you into the dirt, they land on your head after jumps and force you into a crumpled, spinning fetus splayed in the dirt. In short, they aren't forgiving. I wouldn't say cheap, but definitely tough, difficult, sometimes even unfair. Still, I enjoy AI here. It's tough and challenges me in every race. Also, the riders don't unnaturally stay in front the whole race, or rubber band right behind me until the very end, no matter their performance. I have seen the AI riders fighting amongst themselves, them crashing into other parts of the courses, and landing on each other's heads, too. It's quite amazing to watch them go at it.   In this same line of thinking, I was bothered by the crash system. When I was knocked over by a rider, OK, I was knocked over, it happens in real life. But I can't see them from behind, and it's not my fault that I got hit. So, what exactly is the system for putting me back in the game at the same point? It appears to be a system in which players start exactly where they left off, regardless or whether they were driving perfectly in first place and were knocked over, or in the middle of the pack, and knocked over. I felt cheated several times by ruthless AI that bowled me over from behind and then ruined my chances to get back into the race. Is that just real-life racing? Or slightly over-amped AI at work? Methinks the latter.   Lastly, I have to mention that while I like the controls, the ultra flexible trick system, and the nearly perfect sense of balance in these bikes, I have a problem with the off-course deaths. If a rider strays off the course by more than about four feet, he automatically crashes. The computer just dusts your player and starts you back in the game, in short, punishing you by straying off course. This is, in my best French, lame. I understand that the design prevents riders from cheating -- you know, cutting courses -- but why halt the race and fluidity of the event? If someone cheats, disqualify him or her from the race. Set up clear boundaries that notify riders that cheating equals losing. Just don't smash them like this.   Graphics MX 2002 is a clean, good-looking PlayStation 2 game. The riders are extremely animated and well textured, and the bikes deliver a good sense of animation -- shocks, et al -- and they game moves at a crisp 30 frames per second. The courses are huge and are populated by a lot of polygonal objects. And the level of dust that spits up and trails from behind the bikes is cool looking.   It's pretty clear, however, that the riders and their bikes are the most detailed objects in the game, and that the textures of the backgrounds aren't quite up to the same level. I'm not sure if PCP&L had difficulty with the PS2's memory, or how involved Criterion's Renderware was involved in the management of the textures (the game uses Renderware), but the game's overall level of textures are quite blah, ho-hum, snory-borey, you get the picture. They're not horrible, they're not stunning, but they are repetitive, bland, and convincingly average. You'll see tons of the same textures in the game used over and over, much to this graphic tart's chagrin.   That said, the authenticity of the real courses is unshakable. They have been re-created from real true-life courses with scientific precision. PCP&L used topographic maps transmitted from satellite photography to map the size, scale, height and other dimensions of each of the 20 real courses.   One of the best visual treats in MX 2002 is the set of great bails. When riders lose their grip, or fall, or just plain crash, they hurl into the air -- or whatever -- with the most darkly amusing animations. These guys flail into walls, or other riders, and spin and twist into the air like helpless flailing people might -- only better. There are a few problems with these animations, the first of which is that on occasion, I have seen a rider react totally wrong to the incident. In this instance, he moved extremely slow, and looked all wrong. It's only happened twice, but it pissed me off because I had to watch him push through the animation as the other racers passed me by.   Sound The sound department is a mixed bag. I'll deliver the good news first. The bike sounds are totally authentic. They whine and grind with all sorts of variances with highs and lows that resemble the real bikes perfectly. When a rider jumps you hear the engine spin, and when you hit the acceleration hard at a standstill, it winds up real nice. Landing in the dirt produces nice skid sounds, and the grunting sound from the riders is actually quite simple. You'd think you'd hear an ~Aaaaaaiieeeeee!~ Or ~AAAGGHHHHHH!~ But here, when a guy lands hard on his head, you hear a simple, ~Ugh!~ Hm... Also, there is crowd noise, but it's really quiet in this game, almost hidden. What's up with that?   Now, music is totally subjective, so depending on what you like, this music either ~sucks~ or is ~phat.~ Whatever. I like all kinds of music and this kind -- indy rock, and the formerly-indy band Saliva -- is fine with me. I like the songs well enough, and I kinda like them more than before. They have certainly grown on me. They're heated songs, you know, that get your adrenaline pumping, and in that they work. Considering where Ricky Carmichael has come from -- Vanilla Ice from the first game -- the music in this game has progressed beautifully.   The big problem isn't so much the music, but that there simply isn't enough of it. You hear the same seven songs over and over and over and over... Variety is the spice of life, and this meal is a stale corn dog. It's got corn, and dog, and that's it.In the end, MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is the best motocross game I have ever played. I played Excitebike and I respect it, but I never liked it all that much, and what's more I didn't have that much fun playing it. MX 2002 fuses realism with arcade styles beautifully and it opens up the once stodgy motocross sub-genre into a world of stunts, tricks and freestyle racing like no game ever has before it. The deep career mode, with its amateur and pro 125cc section, plus the 250cc season should keep straight-forward motocross fans happy for a long time, and for those who like freestyle, too, courses such as San Diego Freestyle, Shaffer Arena, and Bus Jump will keep you going for days with their giant courses and hidden lines. I think that once people pick up this game they'll be surprised at how versatile and deep this it actually is. But so many folks won't ever play it because they think that because it's motocross it's no good, or it's limited, or whatever. They don't know what they're missing. Well, like my Dad always said, ~more for the rest of us!~", "date": "Jul 3, 2001"}
