While graphics were a considerable step up from the blip-friendly '70s offerings, developers prided themselves on their ability to make a title unbelievably hard. A vast array of monsters and waves of pitfalls and booby traps was the only way to make a game right. It goes without saying then that the list of difficult classics is as long as their respective enemy set; titles such as Ikari Warriors, Shinobi, Ninja Gaiden, and of course the king of all medieval action games, Gauntlet, are all card carrying members of club whoop-ass. Surprisingly, there hasn't been a sequel or remake to any of those games for years, and up until recent times, they'd been all but forgotten. Fortunately for us, Midway Games had quite the epiphany and after a long overdue hiatus brought us the arcade quarter-muncher Gauntlet Legends.   For me, a return to the world of Gauntlet was more than a welcome surprise. An avid fan of the older 8-bit NES cartridge, I played my soon-to-be banned Tengen cart like there was no tomorrow. I was up to my neck in monsters and perplexed by many a challenging puzzle day in and day out -- in other words, I had indeed been snared by the short and curlies (even though I didn't yet have said curlies).   And so here we are, long after the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation ports and following the Dark Legacy arcade update, Dreamcast owners can finally play their own interpretation of a new modern arcade beast. Gauntlet Legends has been delivered into our elongated, greasy monkey hands and I'm delighted to report that it's everything I hoped it would be.    Essentially the same game that powered arcade machines all those years ago, Legends has been improved for the new millennium. Brazen three-dimensional graphics and all-too spectacular special effects have suctioned themselves onto the classic play engine. Even better is the inclusion of all the puzzles, characters, and items from the Dark Legacy upgrade, providing the most complete rendition of Gauntlet Legends out there. Those of you who bought the inferior 32- and 64- bit versions should prepare for a trade-in.   The game itself couldn't be simpler; Choose from a wide array of characters ranging all manner of colors and classes to search out the sacred runes. Needed to banish the demon Skorne to Hades forever, the runes are your main target and must be found by accomplishing many a harrowing task. To recover them you must hack and blast your way through armies and armies of evil-doers, grab items along the way and gain levels RPG-style to unlocking the latter stages. Straightforward and easy to play, you'll only need to use three buttons (attack, magic, and turbo) to unleash your bucket of mayhem on a legion of baddies just waiting to die.   In an interesting turn of events, the onscreen action is actually much easier to handle than its arcade counterpart. The analog stick lends itself well to the 3D engine and provides more precise control than a stick does. Good news for those of us whose pockets aren't quite that deep, and even better news for those of us out there who want to prove that the Dreamcast default controller can be good for something after all.   Graphically, the DC rev matches the cabinet offering frame for frame. Much brighter and heavily detailed when compared to the other translations, graphics that proved to be the games biggest weakness on the other systems has turned into a leading strength on SEGA's. Busty barbarian babes and colorful clown freaks look every bit as good here as they did at the light gallery, plus the textures found in the environment here are a notch above any other version -- including the stand-up box.   If levels and challenges are what you're looking for, you can find them here too. Creative takes on famous fantasy locales and situations serve as the backdrop for clever but intuitive button-switching chores and the unstoppable battalion of creatures will keep you busy for hours. Nicely designed slopes, caverns, and rotating bridges help to form one an experience likened to those 8-bit days of yore in a stunning new package.   The real star of Gauntlet Legends, though, is the killer multiplayer mode. While the singular game can be quite engrossing in its own right, tackling golems and dragons with three of your buddies is unbelievable fun. Forming strategies and conquering the baneful minions without mercy as a group is what it's all about. The best part about it is, that with all the special items, weapons, and characters you can choose from, every adventure will feel like a new one no matter how many times you play through it. As any big game fan will tell you, titles that can pull that off successfully and not suck are the serious goods.   Now I'm not going to fib and say that Legends isn't without its problems. Having to reset your game options every time you turn the system back on can be frustrating, and playing through a tough mission only to find out that you missed a rune (which can be very hard to find later on) means that you'll have to repeat some of the same stages until you find it. But for the most part, all of these can be overlooked in favor of the excellent fun lurking in the GD-ROM.Fast, furious, and all together entertaining, Gauntlet Legends is one of the best mindless action quests to come along in a quite some time. For those of you in search of power, fortune, and challenge (it gets absolutely insane on the hardest difficulty setting) Gauntlet Legends won't (and can't) steer you wrong.", "date": "Jun 7, 2000"}
