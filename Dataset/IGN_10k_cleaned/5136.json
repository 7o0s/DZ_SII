Engagingly deep game play, well-written storylines, excellent and intuitive control scheme -- al have propelled the series to the top of the charts. So, when Sorrent decided it wanted to dip its toe in mobile RPG-dom, a fledgling field if there ever was one, it naturally turned to the high-quality, highly visible franchise. Does this wireless take on the best-selling Advanced Dungeons & Dragons-themed game do the fans right? Or should Sorrent have cast their twenty-sided dice elsewhere?   Features:   Seven levels  Main and sub-quests  Create-a-character   After enjoying two Baldur's Gate preview sessions with Sorrent's Stephanie Morgan and having a full weekend to explore the Forgotten Realms (the classic landscape where many D&D games take place), we can safely say that how ever much this game bloats your cellphone bill, it's money very well spent.   Mobile gamers now have two distinctly different RPGs to download on their handsets: Sorrent's Baldur's Gate and JAMDAT's Neverwinter Nights. If you are looking for an outrageously deep RPG, complete with tons of item management and an overworld full of towns and dungeons, then Neverwinter Nights is the choice for you. However, if you are more of a casual fan looking for an accessible RPG that still presents a rock-solid D&D experience, then may we steer you towards Baldur's Gate.   You begin Baldur's Gate as you would any self-respecting D&D game: character creation. Choose from races like humans and elves, half-orcs and half-elves and then select from numerous character classes like paladin, sorcerer, and barbarian. Certain races are better suited for specific careers, which is something that should be taken in consideration from the get-go. Bigger races are better off being fighters and barbarians. Thoughtful races like elves flourish as sorcerers or rogues.   Don't be fooled into thinking your choice doesn't matter in the long run. Sure, the story doesn't change, but because each class has powers that affect the overall game. The barbarian has a rage attack that will help clear out a room full of goblins. Rogues have lock pick skills that will possibly help you extract good items from sealed chests. So, think about how you want to experience Baldur's Gate before charging into battle.   Now, if you are a seasoned Baldur's Gate player with hundreds of logged hours on the PC versions, you're in for something of a surprise here. The handset version is only vaguely related to the PC edition. Controls, displays, and stories are different to the core. This is Baldur's Gate in spirit, existing in the same universe with D&D rules.   Baldur's Gate is played with your lone hero -- no party system here. Using the touchpad and the OK button, you must trudge through the seven levels and attack hordes of evil warriors all by your lonesome. Each of the seven levels is set up very linearly with a main quest and an optional sub-quest that usually results is earning more money, more experience, and perhaps a sweet piece of armor or a better weapon.   Our detailed write-up of the game's play structure and first level can be found here. It will give you a good idea of how the game unfolds.   The seven-level game will certainly keep you occupied for a half-dozen hours. And the best part of that is it's not artificially extended in any way. You are constantly progressing forward, completing goals and moving on to the next area. You're learning new skills and new attacks, and it's fun to start unleashing new spells on unsuspecting enemies as soon as they are learned. Even shopping, a normally tedious experience, is entertaining in Baldur's Gate because you're always curious what item will be available next. Thanks to a degree of randomness, you never know what will be in the next shop -- or even better -- in the next chest. Maybe you'll stumble upon an ultra-rare piece of armor that will help repel enemy attacks and allow you to live to fight another day.   Baldur's Gate is a reasonably good-looking game. We've certainly seen more accomplished visuals elsewhere, but Baldur's Gate certainly gets the tone and atmosphere of a fantasy game right. Dungeons are dark, forests are lush and leafy. Your character sprite is decently detailed, but it's unfortunate that it never changes with new gear or anything like that. Little touches like that go a long way, but there is always memory limitations to think of.  Baldur's Gate is a very worthwhile download for the more casual RPG fan, as I would suspect the majority of cellphone gamers are. If you're looking for a huge, deep RPG, you probably know that you beter start looking at your PC or at a game like Fable. But if you want an adventure with definite D&D trimmings that can be consumed in bite-sized portions, look to Baldur's Gate. Think of it as a companion piece to your PC and console RPGs, a way to take swords and sorcery on the bus. It has a good length, decent graphics, and smart game play.", "date": "Oct 19, 2004"}
