And if you have any pleasant memories attached to that game, there is an excellent chance you will enjoy MMJ Games' latest creation, as it borrows a few game play mechanics.   Features:   Nine levels  Boss fights   Air Wars is a simple shooting game where you must clear the skies of enemy planes. The big change-up? Your are constantly progressing through time, starting the game in a World War I biplane and finishing your adventure as a futuristic space pilot. As you shift time periods, you pilot different aircraft, from planes to helicopters, but your weapons systems pretty much stay the same.   Back to the comparisons to Scramble. The game play set-up is pretty much identical. You fly from left to right, blasting enemy craft out of the sky while missile silos at the bottom of the screen launch projectiles at you. You are always burning fuel, so you must keep blasting gas replenishing tanks and depots (marked by giant ~FUEL~ signs). You are armed with both a forward-aimed blaster and bombs, so any strategy you had for Scramble will pretty much apply here.   Air Warsis pretty fun. It's light and breezy, but the action does get hectic from time to time. At the end of each level, a boss machine from the era will confront you. For example, in the Gulf War era, you will square off against a SCUD launcher. There are nine levels, but they're not terribly difficult. If you're even remotely adept at the genre, you'll finish Air Wars in an afternoon. But for a few bucks, that's not exactly a bad deal.   The game looks okay. The backgrounds are just repeating textures, but there is some parallax scrolling to give the game a slight sense of depth. Some simple particle effects make explosions look good, but when there are a lot of bullets on the screen, these particle-spewing crashes can unnecessarily complicate things. There are different music themes for each level that loop, replacing any actual in-game sound effects  Air Wars is something of a throwaway game. You won't return to it over and over, but the time you do spend with it will be worth it. It's light and simple, like any good summer entertainment. So consider giving Air Wars a download when whiling away an hour or two traveling this summer, especially if you're a fan of the shooter genre.", "date": "Jul 23, 2004"}
