Remarkably we're given a fast paced, quick twitch game that'll have you reacting and strategizing on the fly like a fighting game but you'll also have to have the inventiveness and anticipation used in most strategy games for the PC. Battlegrounds brings key elements of these totally distinct genres together --without one getting in the way of the other-- and this is the game's greatest appeal even for PC gamers who live and die for RTS games. It might be a limitation of the license itself or a design decision, but it also feels like the developers were holding back to keep from alienating the masses of gamers, especially on the console. There's the potential for some grand things to come out of this strategy-fighting hybrid game system.   Gameplay  Much of the depth and detail of Magic: the Gathering beyond the basic magic systems had to be sacrifice or streamlined to keep the action fast paced. The interface is very much like a fighting game, or better yet, a volleyball title with the two combatants facing each other and a dividing line between their two halves of the battleground. Your character is a magic user, so the emphasis isn't on throwing physical combo attacks and flying piledrivers. This isn't to say mastering the timing of blocks and attacks isn't crucial, because they are. It's just that summoning creatures, casting enchantments and spells to attack defend and boost your own character's or your critters' abilities is the main point of Magic the Gathering: Battleground.  The system is setup around your ability to collect magic in the form of shards and crystals during the heat of battle to spend on the various spells that you'll be unlocking as you make your way through the solo Quest mode. Basic spells and creatures may cost only 1 unit of magic while the more powerful dragons and devastating attacks and enchantments will be much more expensive. Your character has to move around the battleground to pick up magic that's automatically generated, coughed up by deceased creatures (yours and theirs) or even generated magically by a spell or two. You have to be strategic in planning what kind of attacks you want to use but there are so many variables to consider. There's the time it takes to build up the mana you need, the enemy's mana status, what attacks they're vulnerable to, when to trade offense for defense, etc. In fact the game does an excellent job of compelling you to be efficient just like a PC real-time strategy game.   Sending multiple creatures to attack your enemy is the main means of getting stuff done in Battlegrounds. You summon creatures of varying abilities and strengths and they automatically engage in their attack routines whatever they may be. You're merely choosing the time and place for them to spawn and re-spawn. Like a turn-based strategy game, your creatures will engage an enemy and, should they fall during that ~turn~ and if they have enough life left, they'll respawn from the location that you first targeted and start the whole thing all over again. This is as important for cheap creatures with very little health, but when you have big treants or even cheapies enchanted to have extra life force, it becomes crucial. The time it takes for a creature to march or fly from their spawn point can mean the difference between victory and defeat. You can't summon creatures on your opponent's side of the battleground but hatching them right near the dividing line ensure they'll get to the enemy sooner rather than later. Similarly, powerful but delicate creatures might be better utilized if their spawn points are near the rear so they can safely attack while still being protected.  Throwing enchantments and booster spells in to the mix only makes things more interesting in Battlegrounds. The layers of strategy you can employ, especially once you start playing head to head online, are many and varied. The game's solo campaign has a pretty flat learning curve since the gameplay concepts are going to be new to everybody, but this is also very necessary. Requiring gamers to utilize newly unlocked spells and creatures to advance to the next level is a nice touch. Taking cheap melee units and quickly giving them a spell that makes them faster or tougher or more deadly will throw off both the CPU and a human opponent. A trick like this might end up costing less magic than some mega-expensive, and equally spectacular, move. In the solo campaign, just like when you hop online to play against others, you're limited to 10 spells in your spellbook. You can have the three categories of summoning, spells and enchantments but you can split up your 10 spells however you see fit across those categories.   One problem we had with the solo campaign was the way you're forced to learn everything in the five schools of magic from scratch. That is when you build up your abilities and skills enough to beat the master of one school, you're starting over when you begin the next color of magic. Red, green, black, blue and white schools of magic each have their strengths and weaknesses and you're obviously most effective when you have the best of each in your arsenal when you go to battle friends. It's similar to how many Xbox Live games have solo campaigns ultimately designed to reward online players.       Creating your custom spellbook is the major hook of the multiplayer game. Your skills using your attack and defense won't come into play as much as your ability to unleash a devastating combo of magic attacks and creatures. Like any head to head online game, you're getting a much different challenge out of human players since people tend to be either way dumber or way more aggressive than any CPU. There's no in between. It's the fact that you'll have to adjust to your opponent on the fly and read and react to what they're doing that makes the head to head game appealing. With only 10 spells in each player's book there's a counter for everything and at times you simply won't be equipped to deal with a particular caster's brand of magic. Retooling your spellbook is no cause for shame. In fact knowing what tricks you need to pull out is the mark of a skilled player.  Graphics  The look of Battlegrounds could be a little better especially considering there's very little camera movement and you're limited to the number of characters on screen by your magic abilities. The magic effects are decent with particles zipping about and flames dancing around. The main caster characters aren't nearly as detailed and spiffy looking as we'd like them to be.   It can be a little difficult to recognize the different creatures you're summoning once they're running around on the battleground doing their thing. Sure you can distinguish a flying unit from one that runs and little guys from big guys but often times the distinguishing characteristics of similar looking units can be hard to detect. There are several effects that could've been more dramatic than what we ended up with. Not all enchantments and booster spells you throw will be easy to recognize especially during the heat of battle when you're worried about keeping enemies off your neck and picking up magic and what not. We're not sure if super beautiful graphics wouldn't have been wasted on a game like this since there's so much info on the screen and it's all important and needs to be digested. Nonetheless the game's look could stand an upgrade or two given the power of the Xbox and most PCs these days.  The frame rate stays nice and smooth even with all hell breaking loose on screen, but this is mainly because the character models are relatively simple. Lighting isn't what it could be and this has a lot to do with the very basic look of the creatures that you'll summon and the casters themselves.  Sound  The main function of sound in Battlegrounds is to alert you to events that you're not going to catch with your own two eyes --or one eye if you wear a monocle. There's just not much voice or fancy musical elements to speak of in this game. Your surround setup isn't going to be totally wasted but this certainly isn't a game that's going to make you hug your 5.1 system.    The cutscenes aren't even showing off much production in terms of sound. When it comes to gameplay, all you're getting is sound effects to go with the magic you're throwing and the sounds of creatures hatching, battling and dying. It's all done well enough but sound is not one of the strengths of the game.  Battlegrounds is a nice change of pace for hardcore gamers because it combines elements from fighters and RTS games but I'm not sure if your average gaming schmo will be able to get into it. The interface and control is simple enough but the depth of this sucker will likely be lost on most. I can't help but thinking the best of what this game had to offer was left in the development studio somewhere for fear of overwhelming gamers who might not be ready for all it had to offer. It seems to me that it barely offers enough to get the attention of serious gamers but hardcore Magic The Gathering fans will likely want to stick to the card game that already know and love. We give Secret Level a ton of credit, however, for doing the obvious and including Xbox Live play in a game that demands it. Most developers would've just skipped it altogether and offered some lame excuse about user base or something.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
