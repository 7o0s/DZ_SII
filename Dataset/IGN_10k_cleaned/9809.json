Mortal Kombat, the media's favorite whipping boy when it comes to showing how violent videogames can get, meets the world's most popular game platform for kids. Of course, we're talking Game Boy here, so don't expect copious levels of gore and violence in the first color handheld incarnation of the arcade fighting hit.    Eight MK characters, including Fujin, Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Tanya, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reiko, Shinnok and Scorpion + hidden. Three challenge levels. Special Game Boy Kombat Kodes. FMV fatalities. In-game speech. Compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color.   The Game Let's face it, with its merely average fighting system, the Mortal Kombat series owes a great part of its success to the fact that it combined fast action with over-the-top violence and buckets of blood. But how does this translate to the Game Boy? In order to reach a broader handheld audience and receive a Teen rating from the ESRB, Midway had developer Digital Eclipse (is there any game these guys aren't programming?) tone down the gore level to a minimum. Gone are the puddles of blood from the arcade and console MK4 incarnations and we're  left with bare-bones ~kombat~ before drab backgrounds with short ~FMV~ fatality sequences that are little pay-off for braving the game's boring fights.  The eight characters that made the cut from the original MK4's 15+ are recognizable, thanks to the large, tricolored sprites and the animation isn't bad. But the large sprites have their price and the game just doesn't feel smooth, fast and responsive enough to call itself MK4. Running is easily executed by holding A and B, A throws a punch and B triggers the kick, while the Start button blocks attacks (if you can reach it without hurting your thumb). Entering key commands to pull off some of the few (and rather unspectacular) special attacks is simple. Three strokes do the job for the special moves and a maximum of four commands on the directional pad unleash each character's fatality on a stunned opponent.  In the sound department, MK4 disappoints with annoying ~percussive~ tracks and weak sound effects, but at least the game spits out a few amusing voice samples, such as ~Fight!~ and the ubiquitous ~Fatality!~  Sadly, MK4 doesn't support link-up gaming, which means you can only beat up on the computer. To make thing worse, the computer AI in the one-player mode is simply laughable and fails to present a serious challenge to any Game Boy fan. While it may appeal to die-hard Kombat fans, everyone else is best advised to skip this below average pocket fighter. I enjoyed Mortal Kombat 4 on the console systems quite a bit, but the Game Boy version just doesn't cut it for me. Playing alone with an overly limited set of moves against a dumb computer drone gets old real quick. The inclusion of lots of Kombat Kodes is nice, but it's just not enough to energize this lifeless port.", "date": "Jul 20, 1999"}
