Everything. There are costumes, frantic fights, throwing stars and gravity-defying jumps. These masked men and femme fatales dance though my nighttime dreams and karate kick my ho-hum days.   That said, imagine my elation when Sensei Dunham interrupted my mediation hour to hand me Taito Legends 2. I popped the title in and found two games to help me live out my neck-snapping dreams. In Kuri Kinton I'm kicking guns out of the hands of bad guys and in The Legend of Kage I'm wielding the cat-like reflexes of a trained assassin? Sign me up, Cobra Kai!   Stop -- ninja time. Although my world is traditionally a karate dojo and not a knitting class, there are plenty games in Taito Legends 2 for those of you unskilled in the way of the warrior. The game packs 39 titles ranging from Lunar Rescue, a simplistic 1979 spacecraft game that has you avoiding asteroids and aliens while transporting people from the moon to the mother ship, to Puchi Carat, a 1997 game that has you bouncing a ball back and forth Pong-style while destroying colored jewels.    The Legends 2 roster includes:  Alpine Ski  Arabian Magic  Balloon Bomber  Bonze Adventure  Bust-A-Move Again (Puzzle Bobble 2)  Cameltry  Chack'n Pop  Cleopatra Fortune  Crazy Balloon  Darius Gaiden  Don Doko Don  Dungeon Magic  Elevator Action Returns (Elevator Action II)  Front Line  G Darius  Gekirindan  Grid Seeker  Growl  Gun Frontier  Hat Trick Hero (Football Champ)  Insector X  Ki Ki Kai Kai  Kuri Kinton  Liquid Kids  Lunar Rescue  Majestic Twelve (Super Space Invaders '91)  Metal Black  Nastar Warrior (Rastan 2)  Puchi Carat  Qix  Raimais  Ray Storm  Space Invaders '95  Space Invaders DX  Syvalion  The Fairyland Story  The Legend Of Kage  Violence Fight  Wild Western   Silly, rabbit. Qix is for kids. The controls for Legend 2 are tight, responsive and customizable. Don't want to use square to cast magic spells in The Fairyland Story? Feel free to switch your magic to whatever button you like and then fly off on your broom to crush any of those pig/wolf soldiers that try to get in your platforming way.    Although some of the earlier arcade games look like  well  early arcade games, the more recent titles provide solid graphics and engaging gameplay. Hat Trick Hero, a soccer title from 1990, packs seven international teams into a bright and colorful game of slide tackles, fouls and the mandatory team celebrations after each goal. Throw in a two-player co-op/competitive mode and you're set for a night of annoying your friends by screaming ~GOOOOAAAAL!~ over and over.   Hat Trick isn't a rarity in Legends 2. Most of the games include a two-player mode whenever applicable so you and your favorite second player can beat the hell out of each other in the one-on-one brawler Violence Fight or team-up to take on evil poachers in the beat'em up Growl. Heck, have you always wanted to go head-to-head with a bud in Liquid Kids and see which of you can eat the most cake and get Hipopo to the finish line the quickest? Your prayers have been answered.   Get me off this neon rock. But it's not all perfect in the land of classic gaming. The fact of the matter is compilations are a dime a dozen on the PS2, and gamers have come to expect a certain degree of garnish with their classic titles -- y'know, nifty unlockables, loads of options and maybe some re-imagined titles.    Taito Legends 2 delivers none of those things.   Where are the high score inital lists, the 3D arcade cabinets at the game selection screen, the adjustable skill levels and the developer interviews? That might seem like a lot to ask for, but not when you remember that the first Taito Legends included all of those things. In fact, the polished package was what set the game apart from its competitors in David Clayman's 2005 IGN review.   ~Where Taito Legends will win admirers is in the presentation,~ Clayman wrote while praising the cabinets and dancing Space Invader. ~All of these elements add up to an enjoyable compilation that missed the pitfalls of most other collections. Taito could have simply provided us with a numbered list of ports but instead it took the extra time to add to the presentation and it shows.~   Why go to history class when you can play Wild Western? This time, Taito decided the numbered list of ports -- that you can reorganize if you like -- would suffice, and it's a painful blow to the overall product. Although ~Gotta catch'em all~ Gamers are going to pick up Legends 2 just to complete their collections, folks browsing the local EB or GameStop (the only places to get Legends 2) would be wise to pass this option-less compilation over for one of the other fleshed-out arcade experiences on the rack.Thirty-nine games for $20 is nothing to scoff at, and most of these titles are a lot of fun to play. However, in a market thriving with compilations, Legends 2 is just outclassed by its predecessor and other titles that have shown us how much could be packed into these collections.", "date": "Jun 4, 2007"}
