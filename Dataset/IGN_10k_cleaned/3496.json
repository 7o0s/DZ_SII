Piglet's Big Game and Movie are scheduled to release together on March 21 -- one week. In conjunction with the theme of Piglet's Big Movie, the digital Piglet proves that he may be small but he can still be a big hero. The title, which is developed by Doki Denki (the same team that made the N64 Tigger's Honey Hunt), is clearly targeted at younger players and as a kid's game it succeeds. It's full of character, literally, and truly capitalizes on the Winnie the Pooh license while simultaneously delivering youngsters simplistic, but relatively enjoyable challenges, puzzle solving, item collection and more. Parents looking for a solid game for their child should keep reading. Everyone else, turn away.  The Facts  Seven colorful, character themed levels Enter the dream worlds of your favorite Winnie the Pooh characters Confront Heffalumps and Woozles and scare them with a brave face Defeat enemies by correctly entering timed button sequences Collect cookies and use them to learn new ~brave faces~ Take control of different characters and utilize their abilities Unlock Disney's Winnie the Pooh cartoon clips as you progress Watch animated cut scenes of completed levels with the replay option Lots of quality animation and voice acting One player only Requires 14 blocks free on memory card Auto save feature   Gameplay Piglet's Big Game was designed with younger gamers in mind and would best suit players age 10 and under (oh, and Matt Casamassina). The play mechanics are simple and mostly self-explanatory. The player, as Piglet, is on a mission to explore the various dreams of his friends from the Winnie the Pooh universe and help them along the way. One can immediately pick which character's dream world they would like to enter. Once in a dream, Piglet can explore about colorful and detailed levels while solving basic puzzles and interacting with famous characters from the lucrative franchise. It's simple stuff, sure, but the execution -- from a tight and easy control setup to wonderfully scripted character interactions -- is well done and that makes all the difference between a successful kid's title and a really bad game.  Collecting plays a large part in the game play. Piglet must find hidden cookies throughout each level, which are found in various objects in the environment. For instance, kicking a tree will shake cookies loose from its branches. Chasing down the cookies can be a little frustrating because they disappear too quickly and scatter too far. It's a small ploy to extend gameplay, but it works well enough.  Confronting and defeating enemies is a non-violent match of nerves. Piglet may not be the bravest character, but he must face his enemies and scare them away with a brave face. When an enemy sees Piglet, players must press the A button will flash and once pressed the action begins; a sequence of buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen which must be entered correctly before the enemy reaches Piglet. It is a game of keeping one's cool under the time limit. The button sequence is never extremely long and players can always gain more time by confronting an enemy from a greater distance. Instead of pummeling an opponent with their fists, enemies are defeated by Piglet's beaming confidence. Piglet must learn new brave faces by spending cookies at special points in each level. This battle system is great for the parents of younger gamers who might be concerned with exposing their child to violence. However, it might prove to be a little too shallow for gamers expecting more action.  A lot of publishers try to shovel off bad software as ~games for kids.~ Piglet's Big Adventure really is a game for youngsters and one that sets itself apart from the pack with attention to detail, overall thoughtful design and enough for Pooh fans to really be happy about.  Graphics Piglet's Big Game is nicely complemented with top-notch graphics. Much attention to detail has been given to levels and character models. The residents of the Hundred Acre Woods all animate with the same personality and charm as in the cartoon. Players will find themselves immersed in each colorful level and appreciate their variety.  Piglet's Big Game on GCN  Pooh's level is a decadent candy land, complete with giant cupcakes and candy cane polls. While Roo's level is a cardboard cutout jungle, where one puzzle requires gamers to find an eraser to remove a draw in rock that blocks Piglet's path. The art direction is quite enjoyable throughout the game.      In addition to the environments, characters sport a variety of animations that change depending on the situation. Piglet does not have a health meter on screen, but one can observe his state by the way he walks and animates. Health is measured in how brave players can keep Piglet. After a couple bad encounters with an enemy Piglet will shake with fear and nervously jump with any slight movement of the control stick. Visual feedback from your character will be easier for the young player to understand than having to watch an abstract health meter.  Meanwhile, developer Doki Denki has done a decent job of using some of GameCube's power. While environments are nowhere as near open or large as in other 3D adventures, what's there is at least well textured, beautifully animated and stylistic, and even brought to life with technical enhancements like transparencies. Indeed, each character comes complete with real shadows that project and reform with the background locales -- it's an addition that many of today's big-brand releases don't include.   Cut scenes are numerous throughout the game, and are of high quality. Key characters and objects in the environments are highlighted visually. When the player enters the encompassing circle and presses A, a short cut scene will ensue. These little cinemas will pleasantly provide clues and tips for the player. Although the cut scenes boast high production values, they can become tiresome due to their frequency. This potential flaw is remedied by the ability to skip cut scenes with the start button.  Sound Very well done. The same talented folks who work on the cartoon provide voice acting in the cut scenes and narration. Narration is sewn seamlessly throughout the game and provides numerous helpful hits for the player. If you come into possession of a new item, either Piglet or the narrator will provide an audio explanation of what it is and where it might be useful. Fans of the Winnie the Pooh series will welcome the familiar voices as their guide to the game.  Music is very light and appropriate to Piglet's adventure. The music is comical at times, then mildly dangerous when players encounter an enemy. In a certain level one is given control of Tigger, who must sneak past watchful enemies as quietly as a Tigger can. As he sneaks his foots steps sound like a chromatic scale on the low strings of a bass. It confers an enjoyable feeling of cartoon stealth. Music, voice acting and sound design all contribute to aid the well-rounded package of the game.While certainly not designed for most post pubescent gamers, Piglet's Big Game is a nice little gem for the younger crowd. And if Winnie the Pooh is your thing, this just might be the best game starring the gang from the Hundred Acre Woods. Developer Doki Denki has done a great job tailoring the game to suit younger players. Gameplay is a little repetitive, but is spiced up with numerous cut scenes and the incentive to unlock cartoon clips. The graphics, meanwhile, are of surprisingly high caliber -- detailed and ambitiously animated, and the music and enjoyable voice acting add greatly to the production value. A true kid's game. Highly recommended for younger gamers and fans of Pooh. If you happen to be over the age of 10, though, this one probably isn't for you, even if it is well executed.", "date": "Mar 14, 2003"}
