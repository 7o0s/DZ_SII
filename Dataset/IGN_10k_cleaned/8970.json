The port of the arcade machine provided three new characters to raise the number of fighters to more than 30 characters, and added Ghost Mode to the standard Arcade and Versus modes.  However, the largest oversight to the release was the inclusion of online connectivity to stretch the replayability of the title after you'd crushed the AI and unlocked every item in the game's gallery.  To remedy this situation, Namco Bandai recently released this mode in a new ~patch~ for the game, entitled Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection Online.  While it's definitely something that strengthens the title, it's one of those features that should've truly been included in the original title.   Again, this new online feature set for the pre-existing Dark Resurrection title clearly focuses its attention upon providing a space for multiplayer battles by allowing players to fight in rooms based upon their relative player level.  There are three separate player levels: low, middle and high, which dictate just how good you happen to be.  Low ranges from Beginners to 1st Kyu, while Middle is 1st Dan to 7th Dan, and High is Shihan to Tekken Lord.  To reduce the chances of beginning players getting crushed by more skilled ones, Dark Resurrection Online allows you to search for matches by a variety of criteria, including the connection strength of your opponents and the host of the room, which is marked by three antenna bars.  Players can leap into an Opti Match, which automatically finds ranked match rooms with players of the same basic player level.  You can also try a Quick Match, which will immediately search for and list all of the available rooms that are being run at your current player level.  If these two don't provide enough challenge, you can also choose to perform a Custom Match search, looking for any and all available rooms with your search criteria, but be forewarned: you may find yourself radically outclassed by your fellow fighters.   Finally, we get online play for Dark Resurrection... Whenever you choose to join a room, you take your place at the end of the line, akin to placing your quarter up on an arcade cabinet and waiting your turn to fight the champion of that machine.  Up to eight players can fight it out, testing their skills against the winner, who remains on until he or she is dethroned.  As you wait your turn in each room, you'll be treated to Tekken Live, a direct feed of the battle that's taking place between the current challenger and champion.  This feed is particularly nice, because it manages to capture the action with minimal lag, even if the participating fighters have somewhat questionable connections.  What's more, if the room happens to be a ranked match area, players will wind up receiving Battle Points, which helps improve a player's rank online, as well as fight money that can be saved and used to purchase items within the gallery.   Players aren't solely left up to the mercy of opponents' rooms.  Players can choose to host their own matches, selecting from a number of parameters such as the number of rounds, maximum number of players that can join and whether they'll reserve slots for friends to join them in battle.  In fact, you can completely make an exclusive fighting area, kicking out other players and inviting friends that are solely from your PSN friends list to join you in a room.  Unfortunately, there's no internal friends list within Dark Resurrection Online, so you'll need to exit the title and add an opponent to your friends list (like most PS3 titles) to extend an invite to a match.   Apart from the online mode, Dark Resurrection provides Survival, a new offline mode for players.  Fighters are placed in one round matches against a never ending rotation of opponents to see just how many people they can defeat before they are eventually felled.  Depending on the number of enemies that you defeat, you receive extra fight money, which can be redeemed in the Gallery Store.  However, if you were looking for extra items to be added to the gallery because of the inclusion of Survival mode, you're out of luck.     ... But it's not anything that you haven't seen before. Obviously, the inclusion of the online mode helps when it comes to extending the play of Dark Resurrection.  It's a decent patch, and the inclusion of the online space is much appreciated.  However, there isn't anything particularly new or groundbreaking that you're going to find within this mode.  The rooms themselves look extremely generic, with bland text windows set in Tekken fonts that highlight the number of wins that a player may have or what region a player is in.  Plus, while the ability to jump online and challenge just about anyone is enjoyable, this isn't anything that shouldn't have been included with the original title when it was released in March.   The fact that you have to pay an additional ten dollars for this content is perhaps the most ludicrous aspect to the add-on for players that already own the original PSN download.  At the most, this should've been a free patch or one that provided additional fighters, costumes or gallery items to justify the extra expense.  As it stands now, it's squeezing players for money for practically no improvement on the overall experience.  This isn't a comment on the game itself, which is still enjoyable and still an impressive title.  But to justify making players pay for a basic something that should've already been in the game is a bitter pill to swallow.  It's great to see Dark Resurrection Online rectify the missing online component from March's launch of the title with an added patch.  However, for what you pay for the patch, you're not really receiving a huge return on your investment.  Apart from the offline Survival mode, there's no additional content to be found or unlocked. Online play, while fun, is relatively generic and nothing that you haven't seen before.  It's still a decent thing to have, but you're not really experiencing the best add on packs that the PSN has to offer.", "date": "Aug 31, 2007"}
