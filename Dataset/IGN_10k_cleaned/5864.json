This once mighty arcade cabinet has been shrunk down to fit in your palm, and the graphics look pretty spot-on, too. Which makes it all the more devastating when you realize that the game just isn't that much fun to play.   Everything that made the original great is present, from the multiple stages to the phalanx of enemy jets filling the sky. Each level is bathed in different colors, such as daytime runs over the ocean and sunset raids over the tundra. You have both your vulcan cannon and heat-seeking missiles to bring down the enemy. What's not to love?   The control.   If there's one thing that can undo a perfect good mobile game, it's the control. And that's what brings After Burner II crashing to the earth. Getting out of the way off enemy missiles and planes is a major pain. When you're not making barrel rolls by accident, you're unable to make them when the moment counts. Trying to dodge enemy fire while locking on to jets can be extremely difficult, especially if you've been locked on to.  My bottom totally tingled when I saw After Burner II on the decks for download. I skipped past a few other downloads to get it first, and what a disappointment. The game looks great, but the controls really torpedo the whole experience. Dodging, flying, and locking are so happenstance with the little thumbpad I threw up my hands in disgust. I really wish I could recommend this one, but... crap.", "date": "Jun 29, 2005"}
