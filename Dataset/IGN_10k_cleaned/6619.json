But such exposure can be a double-edged sword, as expectations for the mobile game might not be properly scaled. So, to avoid any disappointment, MFROMA decided to meet them halfway by stocking the mobile Call of Duty 2 with connections to the source material, rather than trying to directly recreate it.   Three-pronged story that follows Americans, Russians, and British? Check. Multiple missions in different phases of the European theater? Check. Authentic weapons and uniforms? Check.   Call of Duty 2 plays, in many respects, like the classic top-down shooters Ikari Warriors and Commando. The map stretches vertically as players push deeper and deeper into Nazi-controlled territory. At first, waves of enemies will come at you in an attempt just to overwhelm, but as you progress further into the game, you will find your quarry getting smarter. Sure, you'll still gun enemies in the streets, but you will also find them seeking cover behind sandbag bunkers, buildings, and other obstacles. The last third of the game is a tough slog, with Nazis digging in like rats, and you having to flush them out with tactical precision and pure bravery.   You should also make as much use out of cover as possible, such as ducking behind sandbags when the screen erupts in mayhem. You can move and shoot while ducking -- allowing you to exchange quick volleys with individual members of the Wehrmacht with several different weapons. The majority of weapons have a secondary fire mode, activated by holding down the fire button. Action is not exclusively limited to rifle engagements. You can use a sniper rifle to pick off lone enemies or use binoculars to call in an air strike. My favorite, though, is blowing up tanks with the rocket launcher.   You fight the majority of the good fight by yourself, but at times, you are flanked by fellow soldiers, eager to get in there and shoot some Nazis. I liked how they didn't behave stupidly -- some got cut down, sure, but not from just standing in the middle of the street, waiting to take one in chest.   Thanks to the way the story is set up, you'll see a variety of scenery. Snowy Stalingrad looks treacherous but the white snow makes it easy to pick out Nazis on the march, and the sandy African desert looks downright unpleasant. You'll work your way through train yards, bombed-out cities, and African townships ~decorated~ with craters. In all, Call of Duty 2 is a visually appealing game. It didn't look like it was pushing the limit of my Sony 710 or LG VX8000, but I thought the sprites and background were drawn quite well.  Call of Duty 2 is a pretty rich World War II shooter for mobile. Right now, there are three games vying for the same space: Call of Duty 2, DChoc's War Hero 1944, and Gameloft's Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood. All of them are actually pretty solid games, but I think gamers will appreciate the length and storytelling of Call of Duty 2. The way it shows you action all over the European theater -- one of Call of Duty's trademark features -- makes it a standout. Recommended.", "date": "Feb 14, 2006"}
