After playing several hours of Glu Mobile's Ancient Empires II, I'm quite comfortable in saying you can find a solid Advance Wars-style experience in this single (and much cheaper) download. Plus, if you prefer a more fantastical setting, rather than a military theme, Ancient Empires II has you covered. Knights, archers, dragons, elementals... all the staples are present and accounted for.   Ancient Empires II follows in the original game's footsteps quite a bit, but that game never saw much exposure on these shores -- so the familiarity is a total non-issue. What matters is that the game is swimming in depth -- there are hours of smart game play tucked inside Ancient Empires II, as you conjure on move your individual units across the grid-ridden landscapes that make of this contest fantasy realm.   The game employs many of the best features from other turn-based strategy games, from Advance Wars toMilitary Madness. You must capture towns and castle to earn resources needed to create new units. The stronger the unit, the costlier it is. All units have strengths and weaknesses, some of those affected directly by the terrain they stand on. There is a lot to remember and consider when making movies, but the game's interface is strong enough that you can track required info with few headaches.   When it is your turn to move, the grid helps out with plotting movements and attacks. Selecting a unit shows of its range, and after moving, you can see their attack possibilities before committing to the move. You'll find yourself spending a lot of time just trying different combinations before settling on the series of choices for your turn.    The units are plentiful -- and none of them feel arbitrary. Everything has a purpose, from the lowly soldier that seems like cannon fodder until you need to restore and occupy a building smashed with a catapult. Water elementals are cool units to deploy on maps with water. You'll have to watch out for sorceresses, as they have the ability to raise the dead. (This enemy is a huge pain in the arse to deal with, as you'll soon discover.) As you use units, they'll earn experience and rise in rank. Veteran units can be ferocious battalions, but they are also precious resources on their own. It takes time to develop a kick-ass unit, and you want to be careful that they aren't ganged up on too badly, because it's a real bummer to lose them and have to rebuild a fresh unit to offer such peak performance.   There number of battles you must go through to defeat the main heavy, some wicked demon dude bent on collecting magical gems for nefarious purposes, is actually fairly small. But the length of these battles is astounding. The first couple aren't too tough, as you sweep through enemy defenses with relative ease. But about the third battle, some solid intelligence kicks in. Suddenly the computer stops making any random bonehead moves. It conjures of the right unit for the right job without fail, knows exactly how to use the environment to its advantage (placing water elementals in the river right next to a township you control), and how to maximize resources. This level of aggression will keep you replaying many of the battles over and over again. Fortunately, it's easy to save your place.   Ancient Empires II has a great Skirmish Mode in addition to the major single-player campaign. Skirmish introduces a standalone multiplayer aspect to the game, where players can hand the phone back and forth and declare war on each other.   Ancient Empires II benefits greatly from its smart looks. Not only does the interface do its job with keeping track of information, but the overall appearance of the game is also top-notch. The unit sprites are nicely detailed on the main map, but in the individual battle scenes, they looks great. They don't have much animation, save for some small movement. Attacks are noted more with battle effects, like the dragon's fire breath stretching across the divide. Ancient Empires II employs some solid music to really get you in the mood for some dragon-busting.  Ancient Empires II is such a rich, satisfying game -- and it's an incredible value, too. This download packs as much play into a $6 download as some #40 GBA carts. That's pretty amazing, and a testament to the talent and care that went into the game's creation. If you want a meaty game with serious longevity, Ancient Empires II delivers over and over. My only complaint is that it sometimes gets almost too hard, and there were times I set the handset down out of near anger. But I always came back to it. And that, my friends, is the sign of a good game. A damn good game.", "date": "Dec 1, 2005"}
