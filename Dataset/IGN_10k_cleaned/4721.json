And almost as if it was true to form, quality be damned in favor of simply getting it up on shelves to sucker the immediate market; Van Helsing is an incredibly rushed GBA title that's has some of the ugliest graphics and sloppiest gameplay put to a handheld movie game. Features More than a dozen levels Password save  Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing, a man whose destiny is to vanquish the land of evil, unholy creatures, coincidentally all Universal Studios-licensed properties like Count Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman.  The Game Boy Advance game follows, almost to a T, the plot of the movie, which Rotten Tomatoes entries will tell you that it wasn't all that spectacular to begin with.  But crappy story and film aside, it's the actual game content we're concerned with in the GBA version of Van Helsing, and boy did the brand get butchered in the move from film to game...at least on the handheld. Vivendi Universal commissioned out the same game development studio responsible for the console game. And as solid as the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube editions ended up, Saffire's portable team didn't put nearly the same amount of effort into the Game Boy Advance version. In fact, it looks and plays like a first-generation title produced by a freshmen studio that had about a month to meet a deadline.  First of all, the game is downright ugly. The Game Boy Advance hardware can handle hundreds of on-screen colors from a palette of several thousand, but in Van Helsing it looks like the development team could only find about a dozen different hues...half of them gray. Everything, from the backgrounds to the sprites, has this pixelated, muddy look that one could argue was intended to match the ~dark~ style of the film. Character animations scatter and jump around so much that it's sometimes impossible to actually figure out what these sprites are supposed to be. Is it an undead skeleton that's attacking or an enchanted rake?  The gameplay of Van Helsing had about the same amount of focus as the art direction. Its all-out brawling design ends up falling flat on its collective butt thanks to sloppy collision detection and redundant button-mashing game mechanics. Players have access to tons of weapons, but the game doesn't do a lot to encourage swapping them mid-action.  The level designs are stupidly designed with elements that don't make a lick of sense: for example, players can throw a grappling hook outward in any of the eight directions, but it can magically grapple items above Van Helsing's head. Some levels restrict players' advancement to the next part of the area until they've attacked enough enemies...which would be okay if the game actually explained why the in-plain-sight exit was blocked off before those enemies were wiped out.  And the game engine can't even keep up with what the designers throw at it, with tremendous slowdown occuring when four or more enemies show up on-screen. And even when you struggle through the experience, it's over in a short gaming session, with absolutely zero encouragement to play it again. It shouldn't be a surprise to see a movie license like Van Helsing arrive on the Game Boy Advance as an absolute crapfest of a portable experience, since this isn't the first time a company rushed a GBA game to market. It still doesn't make it right, and regardless if it was Vivendi's fault for going on-the-cheap with the games development, Saffire's GBA team's inexperience with the hardware, or a little from both columns, Van Helsing is a terrible game on Nintendo's handheld.", "date": "May 26, 2004"}
