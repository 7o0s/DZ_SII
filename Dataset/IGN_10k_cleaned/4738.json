Capitalizing on the felicitous feline's exposure, SkyZone and developer Anthem have crafted a simplistic action game that uses several of the characters from the popular cartoon series.   Features:   Features Pink, Ant, Aardvark, etc.  Freeze other players   Pink Panther Freeze Tag is as simple as they come. It's a quick, easy game of tag where the various characters are turned loose in a maze -- forced to flee from the player as he hurls freezing icicles. The goal is to freeze all of the on-screen characters. And you have to be quick about it, because not only do unfrozen characters can thaw out those in deep freeze, but there is also a timer counting down in the lower-left corner. You can get more time on the clock, though, by collecting special power-ups.   Control is just as simple. Run around the maze with the 1-9 number keys, using 5 to throw icicles in the direction you were last moving. Thankfully, the icicles zoom pretty quickly across the board, so you can nail a fleeing Ant before he gets too far away.   Pink Panther Freeze Tag looks decent enough. It's bright and colorful, and the character sprites look good. Of course, everybody is close to being the same size -- if Anthem did the game to scale, Pink would absolutely tower over Ant.Is the game any fun, though? If you are a fan of the Pink Panther, then this isn't a bad download. It may be too simplistic for older players -- but if you have a younger player around that really wants to play something on your cellphone, give Pink Panther Freeze Tag a chance.", "date": "Jun 2, 2004"}
