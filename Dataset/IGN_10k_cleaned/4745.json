It was a perfect choice since it was the game that launched a gazillion NES systems 20 years ago.  Just two months later, Nintendo kicks off Volume Two in Japan. Why they decided to headline the series with Mario Bros. just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. For collectors, sure...it's an integral part of the Nintendo library and needs to be somewhere in your gaming hoard. Chances are, though, it's already in your collection in some fashion, which makes adding the Famicom Mini version nothing more than a waste of money, and almost a waste of space that could have been filled by another game in the Nintendo library.  Look, I've got nothing against Mario Bros. as a game. It actually has a special place in my nostalgic-filled heart, and I still think it holds up as a decent pick-up-and-play action game. The NES port was pretty spot-on to the arcade version, apart from hardware limitations that caused the crabs and fighterflies to flicker noticeably when they popped up on screen. And the sleek Famicom Mini packaging does make this game a tempting collectible.  But Nintendo's got serious cajones expecting that Japanese gamers will front the full price for a game it's not only updated and packaged a current total of five times in the Super Mario Advance series as well as in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,  but has given the game away, as is, as a collectable in Animal Crossing. It also packaged the game in the US on five e-Reader cards for five bucks. Granted, the past two NES emulated versions on the GBA don't have the two-player mode enabled like this game does, nor could they save high scores. So if you really need to validate its existence, this is where you should do it.  I can understand why it's a part of the Famicom Mini series, but good grief...did it really need to take up a precious slot in Volume Two? That slot could have easily been given to a more worthy classic NES game that hasn't had a chance to shine on the GBA yet. Why not give away the Famicom Mini version of Mario Bros. as a Club Nintendo collectible after purchasing the next ten in the group?  If you haven't already experienced the fun that is Mario Bros in the gazillion iterations already available on the Game Boy, then by all means complete the collection with this one. But that's the only reason why you should spend the twenty beans on this re-re-re-re-release.", "date": "Jun 3, 2004"}
