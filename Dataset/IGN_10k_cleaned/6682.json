{"name": "Sudoku Garden", "name_review": "Sudoku Garden", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/02/sudoku-garden", "text": "Surely by now you've heard of Sudoku, a Japanese number game that has become a worldwide sensation. It's not entirely unlike a cross between crossword and math, where players study patterns to fill in empty squares on a grid with a few ~seed~ numbers. Explaining the rules -- the artistry -- of the game to determine whether you might be interested would take too long for this review -- you either like it or you don't. What matters is if Sudoku Garden is a good mobile representation of the puzzle game.   I have played a few mobile Sudoku games, and none of them were bad. Some have been decent, mediocre, and even good -- but none were an absolute disaster that must be avoided like uranium. However, MFORMA's Sudoku Garden is perhaps the best mobile Sudoku game I have yet played. Not only because it is clean, but also because it is full of puzzles and comes with a great tutorial feature that I think could make a few converts.   In addition to the multitude of puzzles included in the download, the game sports a blank slate where you can input the seed numbers (the starting numerals) from a printed puzzle -- such as your local paper -- and the game plots out the puzzle solution for you to discover on your handset later on. There is also a community area where you can compare your scores against the already healthy slate of other players currently playing the game.   One of Sudoku Garden's best features is the immediate ~check,~ with tells you right away if you have used the correct number in a blank square. I guess you could consider it ~cheating,~ but it's great to have in case you get terribly stuck -- or if you are a beginner still feeling your way around the game. As you get better, you'll use this feature a lot less.   The theme of the game is zen gardens. The puzzle grids are set over sand fields textured by rakes, much like what you've seen monks do when seeking harmony and solace. It's a good theme because it doesn't distract. Throwing black numbers on a stark white background is somewhat harsh. The sandy backdrop and the brown-gray numbers just look pleasing to the eye.  Sudoku Garden is a great mobile version of the puzzle phenomenon. The game screen is easy on the eyes, it offers an incredible host of puzzles (as well as a great tool for using printed puzzles), and includes a great ~check~ tool that will help beginners catch on to the game. If you are a fan of the game and want to have it with you everywhere from the train to the bathroom (where a lot of mobile games are indeed played -- think about that the next time you borrow a friend's phone), Sudoku Garden is a good value. I also recommend it to beginners that want to try Sudoku for the first time -- it's far easier than learning via a book.", "date": "Mar 2, 2006"}
