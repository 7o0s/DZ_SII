Now, we have Rogue Spear on the PlayStation...a blend of first-person shooting and strategy, ported over from the PC.  Hm.  Rogue Spear is a well-intentioned piece of work, and it's better than the version of Rainbow Six (its predecessor) that hit the PlayStation a little while ago.  However, it's still not that good.    Having missed the popular PC version of Rogue Spear, I loaded it up on one of the IGNPC demo computers and had a go through a handful of the single-player missions.  I liked it, but throughout I was observing traits that just couldn't be successfully replicated on the PlayStation.  The planning system, the artificial intelligence, and the overriding emphasis on precision are what make the game good, and they're also missing on the home console.  Gameplay  Rogue Spear looks like a first-person shooter, but it's not; anyone who says otherwise is likely a Counter-Strike refugee who fled that particular battlefield on account of lousy reflexes into the comforting arms of auto-aim.  This is a strategy game -- a strategy game with action elements, certainly, but a strategy game nonetheless.  More important than the actual moment of execution is all the planning you have to do beforehand: absorbing intelligence, setting up your route and tactics, picking your team, and equipping the troops for battle.  Here's where Rogue Spear first runs into trouble.  The PC version uses a navigation system built around waypoints.  Before the mission, you plan your route through the area and what you're going to do from moment to moment by placing waypoints throughout the map -- you connect up those dots to define where your teams move, and attach actions to particular waypoints to define what they're going to do there.  If you want a team to toss a grenade into a room, for example, you stick a waypoint just outside the door and tag that point with the grenade action.  To coordinate team actions, you use ~go-codes,~ waypoints where a team will hold and not progress to the next action until you deliver a signal.  This works well enough in the PC version, because you can define very complex routes and actions.  You could have a team zig-zag or do loop-the-loops through a room if you want, tossing flashbangs in every direction as they go.  The PlayStation version, however, has to simplify things, and that's a problem, because even the PC navigation system isn't quite versatile enough to deal with some threats.  On PlayStation, you can only navigate room by room, not point by point, and the AI follows a set path through every given room.  It becomes immediately obvious that this isn't quite adequate, because your teammates die with unusual frequency, seemingly due to poor navigation and insufficient adaptability.    For example, the Pandora Trigger mission (the first one, in the art museum), breaks your squad into two teams.  One clears the ground floor, the other clears the second, and the two meet up for the climactic assault on the room where the hostages are kept.  On the PC, at the default difficulty, the upstairs team generally has no problem clearing the upstairs on its own (you default to controlling the downstairs team).  On the PlayStation, also at default difficulty, the buggers die like flies.  All-too-frequently, I heard ~Man down!  Man down!~ over the tac net and found myself with no backup once it came time to rescue the hostages.  That is, if I got that far at all.  The AI tends to die through its own foolishness; you yourself usually die due to the poor control.  Rogue Spear demands precision in movement and aiming, precision which is not afforded by the Dual Shock.  This is a game that very much wants a mouse and a keyboard, the latter especially when it comes time to manage complex inventory and command options (have fun managing four teams with the command subscreens), but more immediately just for getting around and whacking the bad guys.  The dual-analog controls are slow, not very exact (even with a heaping helping of auto-aim), and include no option that I can find for adjusting the analog sensitivity (which is ridiculous, because the default sensitivity is much too low).  A few other peculiarities of the console-PC transition rear their ugly head -- for example, the menu screens are often nigh-unreadable due to the small, blurry font.  Even on my sharp WEGA TV, I couldn't tell whether I was supposed to hold down L1 or L2 to rotate the map.  The same problem makes the map hard to read, and decreases the usefulness of the in-mission radar.  Finally, you lose the little map in the HUD that showed you around your waypoints in the PC version.  Now you just have the weak radar and an arrow leading you by the nose.  Two-player multiplayer is available, but not really worth mentioning, considering that there are four-player deathmatch games available on PlayStation with far better looks and control.  Rogue Spear multiplayer isn't any fun with just two players, anyway -- all the excitement of LAN cooperation is gone.  Graphics  The framerate is up in comparison to the original PS Rainbow Six, but it's still pretty slow, and the game in general still doesn't look too good.  The texture quality, for one, is very low, with the same flat colors of the PC version and additional blurring and pixelly bits.  The models are shaky, with plenty of breakup and the joints and strangely shaped limbs, and the quality of the environments leaves a lot to be desired at times.  The Arctic Flare mission, for example, which takes place on a hijacked tanker, includes no sea or sky or coast.  On the other side of the rail is nothing but inky blackness, not even stars, and the rest of the tanker takes some time to be drawn in as you move along the deck.  I'm willing to forgive the poor animation, because it's more or less the same as in the PC version.  I've often wondered why PC FPS developers generally produce such stiff character motions -- any opinions?  Perhaps a problem of sychronizing realistic animations to unrealistic movement speeds and maneuverability, I don't know.  Anyway, Rogue Spear includes the usual curious tendency of characters to seem as if they're running on an invisible treadmill and being superimposed over the environment as they move about.  Sound  Rogue Spear still sounds about as good as it did on the PC, which is pretty good.  The cool Hans Zimmer-esque orchestral score is intact -- sitting still on the intro and menu screens is fun just so you can listen to the soundtrack.  The voice acting is all there in both menus and missions, sounding very cool at all times (the intelligence reports are generally useless, but well-spoken nonetheless), and the effects do the same fine job of creating the atmosphere and hinting at what you ought to be doing.  The tac net chatter is fun (it's always very satisfying to hear ~Tango down!~ from your teammates), and being able to hear the bad guys just around the corner, before you silenced-MP5 them to death, is great fun in an admittedly evil sort of way. But those neat presentation elements can't save what was basically a bad idea from the start.  The interface has been too severely simplified, when in fact it needed some modification in the other direction, and the control scheme just doesn't translate effectively.  Some games need a mouse and a keyboard, no matter how hard you may try to stuff useful shorthand into a controller's limited variety of buttons.  Rogue Spear was a fine game on the PC, and that's where it should have stayed.", "date": "Apr 9, 2001"}
