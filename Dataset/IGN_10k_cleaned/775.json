You can't deny that the original Hot Shots Golf was the best golf had to offer on the PlayStation -- and quite possibly on any other platform. Yes, it was slightly kiddy and definitely has that quirky Japanese feel to it, but the graphics, sound, and presentation were all second to none. So, how does one go about improving on a formula that's already nearly perfect? You don't, you just give the hungry golfing masses more of the same. And folks, I'm here to tell you, that's a good thing.   The original Developers of Hot Shots Golf, Camelot (the same guys behind the fantastic Shining series of RPGs on Genesis and Saturn), are surprisingly enough not the developmental force behind the sequel. Newcomers (at least to the US) Clap Hanz Limited has taken the reins of golf's golden boy and quilted a masterpiece befitting the moniker of the world's greatest golf game. It wasn't until I actually popped the original into my PlayStation that I realized how amazingly good the sequel was, especially for something crafted from a completely different developer. Literally, everything that was in the first game is here (well, minus the super-deformed big-headed designs), and then some.   Gameplay The beauty of the Hot Shots Golf system is that you can still enjoy the game, even if you're not all that good. I personally blow at golf games, and blow hard, but with Hot Shots 2 I was able to get a handle on every subtle nuance of the swing. It's honestly as simple as this: point your cursor at the section of the course you'd like to hit to, press x once to set the power gauge, then again to set the impact. If you want to put spin on the ball (in whatever direction you choose), simply hold that direction before you set your impact. Draws and fades are executed by holding left or right, top or backspin by holding up or down.   Despite the slightly kiddy look, HS2 boasts rock-solid physics; Put backspin on the ball, and it'll be hit higher (for busting out of sand traps), but the wind will catch it easier. Put a little topspin on the ball and you'll cut down on the wind's effects and roll the ball further upon impact. Speaking of impact, weather effects still play a big role, so you won't get the same distance during the spring when it's raining, due to the ball not rolling as far. What it boils down to is the simple fact that you won't find a more solid presentation of golf on any console.   The real meat of HS2, however, isn't in the physics, or even the simple to understand gameplay. It's in the wealth of unlockable options. Just like the first game, you'll unlock players, courses, clubs, and balls via playing the tournament mode or by squaring off against unlocked (but not yet selectable) characters.   The characters are very wacky to say the least. In fact, the character designs are even more diverse than the original. In the same game, you may see a Jamaican, a spunky teen (who's name is Sam, and therefore the best golfer ever), and a bodybuilder look-alike taking up the links in the hopes of winning a skins game. And as in any good golf game, the different players excel or are lacking in different areas like spin, power, and control. In total, there are 13 players (10 of them hidden), five (four hidden) sets of clubs, and six (five hidden) different types of balls to smack around.   The game's depth doesn't end there, as there's also a wealth of play styles. Golf standbys like skins, stroke, tournament, and match play, plus a versus option (the only way you actually make the unlocked new golfers playable -- you have to play them one-on-one and win) and a 9-hole par 3 game. It's this kind of depth that keeps things interesting. Plus, you and up to three buddies can square off in almost all of these modes.    Graphics Hot Shots Golf 2 is the best-looking golf game to ever grace PlayStation. There, I've said it, and Sony; you're more than welcome to start using that in your ads. While the Tiger Woods and PGA Tours try to engulf the player in realism, HSG tosses that formula aside and instead serves up a more colorful, faster moving, and frankly more beautiful graphic experience. And unlike any of the other golf games, it does it with a framerate of pure silk. Never, at any point in the ENTIRE experience, does the graphic quality or smoothness at which it's brought forth diminish. Let me say that again for you developers at EA Sports: the frame is fast and solid.   The original Hot Shots' character designs basically revolved around short, bigheaded characters that gave the game a very ~kiddy~ feel that may have caused some people to just write it off as a golf game for kids. HS2 tries to fix this by introducing more ~normal~ designs. Although the golfers may have dreads or be a little pudgy, their heads never look like they outweigh the body by 50 pounds. What's more, the animations for each golfer are slick and hilarious. Pudgy Mel's toupee pops up on hard drives, and Cedric's birdie victory dance...well; let's just say it involves a hula skirt and some dancing.   The overall graphic presentation is flawless, boasting the same slick effects on long drives and even more ways to review a shot after you've taken it. Balls now scream through the air with streamers, and divots are ripped from the earth on long, powerful drives. Through it all, a gorgeous, colorful world perfectly reflects the seasons and the courses show some great designs.   Sound Well, if you can handle elevator-level musak, you'll be fine with HS2's aural melodies, but with the exception of the menus, you can just turn the music off (in fact, it's not on by default while you're touring the holes). They're light and cheerful little ditties, but nothing Mozart-level.   The effects are fantastic, however, with the sound of steel meeting plastic sounding exactly as it should. Birds chirp, wind billows, and the sound of a ball dropping into the cup are spot-on. The only real gripe I have is the caddy voiceovers, for some reason ~You're decent!~ doesn't make me want to run around screaming for joy, even though I just chipped a shot that landed half an inch from the cup.Clap Hanz Limited did something amazing. They took a nearly perfect formula and improved on it, adding better control, better graphics, more options, and just making it more fun. If you like golf at all, hell, even if you DON'T, pick up a copy of Hot Shots 2.", "date": "Mar 14, 2000"}
