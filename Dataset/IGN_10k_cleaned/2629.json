It was a damn good game on the PC two years ago. But now that it's on the PS2, the porting or re-creating process has taken its toll on poor Cate Archer and her comedic '60s underworld of cheesy code words and dumb American contacts. NOLF has not only aged visually, it's been apparently crammed into a box that doesn't like it so much, creating a world of production trouble.   At its core, NOLF is an excellent game. Boasting excellent level design, laugh-out-loud dialog, some of the best silly videogame characters we've ever seen, and a likeable, sexy lead character in Cate Archer as ~The Operative,~ NOLF is a rock-solid single-player experience. But it's not all rosy. If you can look past the hampered, out-of-date graphics, sticky, annoying controls, and crummy framerate, you'll enjoy it. For some, that's a very big ~if.~   Gameplay  A parody on Ian Fleming's James Bond's world of the British intelligence agency and its inherent sexism, psychedelic '60s mojo, and craggy old boy networks, NOLF stars the slim, sexy Cate Archer, a former cat burglar who's finally gotten the chance prove herself to the big boys at Unity (the secret agency she works for) that a woman can perform just like a man can in the spy business.    As players progress through the game, they'll learn more about Cate's dark past, helping to fill in her rather shady past, in addition to learning about HARM, the enemy organization she's been assigned to crack. And they'll travel all over the world chasing giant German operatic singers, one-eyed villains, and drunken Scotsmen, plugging hundreds of thugs and collecting dozens of excellent weapons in between.    Underneath its ancient looking graphics and poor framerate, this single-player first-person shooter experience is a deep, complex and worthy one that shares qualities with some of the best single-player FPS titles out there, from the stealthy Goldeneye 007 to the extraordinarily deep world of Half-Life. NOLF creates a world of secrecy and intrigue, all the while conveying an immensely sharp sense of humor about itself that's entertaining all the way through to the end.    Some of the best aspects of the game appear in the open gameplay style itself. Monolith's game offers gamers a Point A to Point B experience, like just about every first-person shooter out there, but the approach gamers take to the game isn't restricted, enabling them to seek out a few ways to beat a level, rather than a singular, repetitive path.    Buoying the open approach is the game's heavy emphasis on stealth. NOLF punishes you a little for not being stealthy, but it doesn't force the issue. For instance, video cameras and alarm buttons are located everywhere and a single guard can ruin your stealthy guise, but it'll only bring on more guards early, rather than destroy the mission. Also, the other reason not to trick the alarms is that they create an immensely loud and obnoxious sound that never ends. God, I hate that sound.    Part of the game's intrigue is that it's filled with intelligence items, letters, objects or manila envelopes each containing usually worthless information. The letters are funny or purely asinine, making fun of Harm's bureaucracy or an individual's letter to his girlfriend, and they compel you to search them out, only occasionally providing usable information. At the level's end, the game ranks your performance, counting up intelligence items collected, enemies killed (and which body parts you've hit), etc. Finding the intelligence items isn't even necessary in most cases, but they play to the gamers' desire for adventure, thus creating the need to explore.    The intelligence items just add to the game's core design though. The best levels cleverly place gamers in a wild variety of missions, from escape, rescue, and infiltrate, to detonating bombs, to a few of my favorite levels, including stealing a parachute from an enemy's back while falling from a plane, and revisiting young Cate in her early days as a cat burglar. The level in which she steals money from the restaurant and bar owner is just awesome.    Permeating the game's every scene is sharp sense of wit and irony. The cutscenes usually are worth the price of admission alone, providing some of the best dialog in videogames in years, and occasionally, players are given the choice to select an answer during their conversation, which just adds to the fun. Like an RPG, players can select several answers, usually a smart-ass or a neutral one, though it appears that your choice doesn't really have any bearing on the outcome of the game. It's awfully fun to go back and play each section just to hear what you could have said.   One of my favorite sections occurs in Morocco, when Cate ~tortures~ an enemy. She never touches him, and after patiently asking him three times where her boss is, he tells her his life story, how he has a msters degree at Harvard (or Princeton), how intelligent he really is, and then, sadly, he provides the information she needs. Another favorite part includes monkeys. ~Would you like to buy a monkey?~   These are all of the good things. But I'm a realist, or at least an optimistic realist. To be sure, NOLF suffers from a lot of problems. After having witnessed the game on PC two years ago, it's clear that while some little problems are inherent to the PC game, most of the dilemmas appear to have been added in the port process. NOLF delivers a chunky framerate that often becomes so annoying that its affects gameplay. The framerate also ties into character animations and is connected to the game's control, which is more than suspect.   More to the point, the game offers dodgy, jumpy aiming that quickly becomes a frustrating mess. Add auto-aiming into the mix (you can turn it on or off), and the controls grow near intolerable at times. Even when I jacked up the sensitivity controls in the menu bar, the game's controls proved to be jumpy and inaccurate. It's too bad, really, because a first-person shooter has to deliver a good framerate and smooth control, and NOLF delivers neither.   There are other things I didn't like. While a number of specialized (and cool) items were provided, such as barrettes, explosive lipstick, and body dissolving powder, you'll often find few of them are needed. It's just as easy to whip out an AK 47 or a silenced 9 mm and smoke some dude as it is to throw explosive lipstick at him, which takes extra time and usually costs you some health in a crowded room. The items themselves are cool, and yes, it makes sense that you aren't required to use them, but they just seemed to fade into the background in terms of usefulness. I was hoping to need them more.    Unlike other games of this nature, cameras and alarm buttons here are pretty brutal. Players can't shoot a video camera and expect to walk on by. It's realistic here: You shoot a camera and the alarm goes off. That's fine with me, but rarely do you have the chance to turn off the alarms (unless I'm mistaken), and I felt that adding the ability to turn them off would have been A) Fun, B) adventuresome, and C) a lot less annoying. The alarm sounds are undeniably irritating. Sure, I beat many levels without setting them off, but man, when I slipped up the game punished me with that piercing noise, with no way of turning them off.   Lastly, while NOLF didn't have much of a multiplayer game going on the PC, the PS2 version is void of the feature. On PS2, it's strictly a single-player game. When I think about it, NOLF is designed to be a single-player game at its core, and I'm thinking that a two-player mode would have been ruinous on PS2, given the sketchy single-player framerate and control. So, the lack of a multiplayer mode turns out to be a positive thing in a backwards sort of way.    Graphics  Even back in the day, when NOLF shipped on the PC, it wasn't a terribly brilliant looking game. Now, in the year 2002, it's not only weak looking, it's incredibly aged in appearance. If this game shipped on PS2 any time before fall 2001, it wouldn't have looked half bad, but with the onslaught of beautiful games on PS2 from just this past fall, NOLF just looks ancient.    The game was never meant to be a graphic eye-stopper in the first place (yes, it was certainly meant to look good), but now it just looks like a sun-tanned granny. Games such as Deus Ex, Red Faction, Quake III, and Half-Life didn't look half as old when they hit the PS2, each looking pretty good in its own way. And while the character models here are higher resolution than the PC version, they hardly help.   But that's not all. NOLF is filled with production problems, from eye-poking artifacts and rampant seams along texture edges to slow, clunky cut-scenes that appear to be under some kind of slowdown spell that makes them crawl and with no ability to convince gamers they're in some kind of fantasy world. The game as a whole appears to have been a huge struggle to get into the PS2, and it certainly shows.    Other than that, the special effects are average, the water one-dimensional, and the textures decent, with the occasional detail that's engaging or designed with care. There appears to be no major improvements that I can see in this port. In short, NOLF looks old and damaged in the process of being ported, and it's too bad.   Sound  Certainly one of the best aspects of NOLF is its dialog. The writers behind NOLF expressed an excellent sense of humor through their characters, and every single one of them, from the main characters to simple guards and assassins, offers an amazing sense of personality and flair. Naturally, Cate Archer is great to listen to, but mostly because of her ability to say so few words. When she says something, it's smart and razor-edged. And as you progress throughout the game, when she doesn't respond to an enemy, you get the feeling that you know what she's thinking. Monolith's writers have created an excellent character that's worth caring for, which is hard to do in a first-person shooter, or in any game for that matter.    Here is an example of a tiny bit of dialog (Cate meets her secret contact in a bar in Germany):  ~You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Can you cook and clean, too?~   ~No, but I can put you in the hospital. Maybe some can take care of you there..maybe.~    Here's another example, you have just stolen an enemy's parachute in mid-air. A cut-scene follows, and as the man heads for his death, in the form of a barn, he says, ~Please be full of hay, please be full of hay.~ Naturally, it's not. The fact is that the game is packed with great lines all the way through, which is one of the best reasons to try and ignore the game's major problems. The voice actors all did a splendid job of delivering great lines perfectly. You will continue to be entertained and humored throughout the entire experience by the dialog and writing alone.    Musically, the game parodies James Bond movie themes (catchy yet empty songs about brief lust and hard choices), while also dabbling in '60s pop music. All of the music is light-hearted '60s diddies, perfectly crafted to suit the game's atmosphere. Nothing in particular is terribly memorable. No One Lives Forever is not a tight game. It's not a game that controls very well, and it looks old and dated. But the game's design, storyline, hilarious characters, and witty dialog are all so consistent and healthy that Monolith's game somehow survives its production problems intact. The game offers an immense variety of missions, and because of its focus on stealth, I enjoyed it, despite its flaws. It's also a huge game, providing a minimum of 15 hours of gameplay. As a strict single-player game for PS2 owners, it's worth playing, primarily as a rental -- Definitely as a rental. Anyone who enjoys PC FPS games on a regular basis won't even want to look at it.", "date": "Apr 23, 2002"}
