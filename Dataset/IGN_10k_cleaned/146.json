And so EA keeps the train rollin' all night long (c'mon, who's an old Aerosmith fan?) with Sims 2 Castaway for your mobile phone. So is it better to just let yourself drown than swim for shore?   You play as, well, you, stuck on an island after an accident sends you and other travelers into the brink and floating to safety on a deserted island. Your main objective is to get off the island, but you'll have to complete some objectives and keep yourself fed and sheltered while you figure out what you have to do next.   Castaway is a simple game that throws in some complex mechanics so you don't get too bored too quickly. Your first objective is to find food and build yourself a shelter. Shake the trees to collect bananas and coconuts so you don't starve to death. There are different areas to explore but they're not all accessible at first. You'll have to complete goals in each area to unlock the next. There's a lot of going back and forth between areas. Luckily, there's a quick route feature and all you have to do is pick the area you want to go to and you'll be there. I'm glad they included it, because your dude moves way too slow to not have such a feature.   Each section has a person (or animal) you'll run into that you have to converse with and find out what goal it is you need to complete for them. Most have more than one goal. For example, Crazy Carl who lives in the caves will share his treasure with you, but only after you fetch him some fish stew. Sandi, who stays on the Bay, can cook it for you, but only after you've found the right ingredients. But you need the help of Higgins the Orangutan to build you a garden to grow the ingredients needed. Get the fish stew, only to find out Carl has another task for you to complete. It may seem a little maddening just from my description, but you're eased into the game and your tasks aren't very overwhelming.   Castaway is filled with small mini games you'll play to complete goals or collect food. You can catch fish but you have to press the center button at the right time to impale one with your spear (getting a spear, is of course, a goal). I guess you can cook the fish but I never found out how. Leyla, who stays in the waterfall area, will make new outfits for you to wear providing you dance with her of course. Use the control pad in a dance dance revolution pattern to complete this mini game. Other games include a surfing one where you have to keep your balance on the board and jump over sharks, play a game of three shelled Monty with the Orangutan and follow along to the beat with a group of monkeys.   Your info screen gives details on your overall status. Needs such as comfort, hunger and energy are indicated by a meter. Keep it full to make sure you don't perish on the island. I only died once because I forgot to feed myself even after the game warned me I was hungry. I guess they weren't kidding. Apparently my human can't go more than eight hours without food or he'll give up on life and swallow his own tongue. There are also social and fun meters but I ignored them, so I'm not even sure if they're essential to your overall survival. The Goals tab tells you what you need to do next and you also have Items and Tools tabs.   Bananas and coconuts are the biggest things to collect because once you scour the island for them, you usually have to wait a full day before collecting more. Playing the Orangutan's game costs you ten bananas, so try and save those. You'll sleep at night, but there will be times when you have to be awake at night to collect different types of fish or complete other tasks. Collect leaves, vines and other items to build shelters and as ingredients for cooking items. A dangerous area is marked with a skull and crossbones icon so try and avoid walking to those areas. I'm not sure if any of them instantly kill you though. I shook a bee's nest and got hurt, but I collected honeycomb in the process. I never used it, but if I had a bowl and some milk I could have had one sweet ass breakfast.   Once you leave the island you can still go back to it and try to complete other tasks that may not have been completed. For example, Sandi wanted a recipe book. You can try to win the book by playing Higgin's shell game and pulling on the slot machine. Different items can be collected, but since it costs ten bananas to play, I kept trying and never got the book. I always got the telescope or sunglasses so I gave up. I guess Sandi can go get her own stupid book.   The controls are simple to use. Move the arrow around to where to want to walk and hit the center or OK button. Interacting with someone is as easy as walking up to them, and the mini games are very easy to control and aren't very long but they can become extremely repetitive. The graphics were very nicely done and each character and part of the island looked very colorful and nicely detailed. The sounds and music were done very well.   All in all, I was on the island for a total of nine days, I collected 573 items and completed 35 goals. I would liked to have known how many goals there actually were and if I missed something but I was too tired of this island to bother going back and finding out.Sims 2 Castaway is a nice little game for Sims fans. It can get very repetitive and I started to lose interest about 4 days into the game, but for a cellphone game EA managed to pack in quite a bit for the money. There isnt a lot of replayability, but if you were stuck on an island how many times would you really want to go back to it after you managed to escape?", "date": "Apr 8, 2008"}
