{"name": "737 for Fly!", "name_review": "Fly!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/07/fly", "text": "I'm of split mind on this game. As a pure sim, it is top notch. As a game, it kinda sucks. Here's my thing. The plane interiors will blow your mind. They have been detailed down to the last screw. Everything outside the cockpit looks like an atomic bomb was set off flattening the landscape.   There are five planes you can fly in Fly! and every one of them has been modeled amazingly well, especially the controls. Every button, toggle and dial is in there and when you slip into the King Air you're going to marvel that anybody can fly these things.   Piloting is also impressive. In-flight overhead maps let you go directly to navigational aids to tune them to your radio signal. Airports are fully documented in pop-up windows that you can reference before coming in on approach, which is great since the air traffic control is hyper realistic. The pre-flight planning map is also a pretty amazing innovation for flight sims.   Fly! also just feels good to fly around in. Turn the lights off, turn up the volume on your speakers and the flight model is pretty damn convincing.   Now the stuff I don't like. First off, a crappy manual. These planes are so realistic you practically need the plane manufacturer's manual to understand what you're looking at. I consider myself a fairly experienced simmer, but I have to admit being daunted by several of the craft.    Then there are the exterior graphics. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and when I took my Cesna to San Jose and then to the coastline, there were some pretty glaring discrepancies in terrain. Also, the visuals don't match up with what the instruments say, with quite a few mistakes in elevation data. Also, if you've never been to San Francisco and do a fly by, you would get the impression that no new buildings have gone up since the 1902 quake: We're talking flat baby.   Then there is the force field around your plane. Okay, I'm being fecetious, there's no force field. But there might as well be one 'cause I haven't yet wrecked a plane no matter how hard I've tried!   Like I said, I'm divided on this one. Some great aspects, some bad aspects. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of civilian flight sim options to choose from. Flight Unlimited is rather old and X-Plane is really expensive  that just leaves Fly! So, I guess the bottom line is do the minnuses out weigh the plusses? They don't for me, but your mileage WILL vary.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
