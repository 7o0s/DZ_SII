{"name": "Thousand Arms", "name_review": "Thousand Arms", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/16/thousand-arms", "text": "Only two years ago, role-playing fans would be hard pressed to name at least two RPGs headed to the US within the near future. Now, on what seems like the cusp of the next generation of Sony hardware, fanatics of the genre can barely scrape up enough dough to afford the near dozen RPGs hitting US shores within the past few months. With so many of role-playing titles popping up in stores and appearing on the ~Coming Soon~ rosters for PlayStation, it seems that games must have a big brand name in order to stand out against the fray. Smaller titles, in kind, are seemingly forced to take a unique slant on the genre in order to survive. And it's in this category that Atlus and Red Co.'s quirky and slyly charming Thousand Arms has garnered much of its support and fan base. For all intents and purposes, Thousand Arms is every bit a traditional RPG. As the game begins, you jump into the role of Meis Triumph, the bright, energetic son in a rich and prosperous family. Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Meis is in training to become a stellar Spirit Blacksmith, a craftsman noted for being able to channel elemental essences into otherwise ordinary objects like weapons. But, the twist in Thousand Arms is that all Spirit Blacksmiths, being male, must find plenty of women to help them ~strengthen~ their tools -- an aspect of the craft that the Triumph family is known for taking to the nth degree. The whole male lineage of Triumphs, in fact, are usual subjects of village chatter because of their near legendary libidinous ways with the more than willing ladyfolk around town. But the Triumph's feudal estate is soon trashed by the treacherous Dark Acolytes who've been storming the countryside in search of an unnamed ~something.~ Meanwhile, Meis flees his village and must run for his life to the nearby town of Boyzby, where he meets up with the lovely, light-hearted and loyal Sodina. And thus the game really begins... Now on a warpath to uncover the meaning behind all the mass destruction and general chaos that the Dark Acolytes are causing, Meis must travel all across the world. Along the way, he joins up with several other wanderers and warriors who have a bone to pick with the sinister organization, as well. But the unique way in which the game is designed and plays out, the storyline is merely a backbone to the development of the bevy of different characters and features within Thousand Arms. Despite its rather standard trappings, Thousand Arms is anything but ordinary. GraphicsVisually, the game takes many cues from previous RPGs, such as Breath of Fire III and Xenogears with its polygonal, 3D environments and almost hand-drawn looking sprite-based characters. Occasionally (OK, more than occasionally), you'll stumble into a seamlessly integrated ~event~ that mixes 2D anime-style graphics directly on top of the polygonal backgrounds, resulting in a style that most closely resembles Japanese digital comic games (Snatcher, Slayers, 3X3 Eyes, etc.). It's a refreshing change that feels much more organic than simply sitting and waiting for a cinema to load, like you would in most RPGs. But this isn't to say that Thousand Arms doesn't have its share of cinemas to watch, including a stunning intro, all wonderfully drawn to make you feel as though you're watching a full-length episode of your favorite anime series. On the world map and in towns and buildings, characters appear in full superdeformed (SD) form using word bubbles to express different emotions like fear, lust (yes, lust) and nervousness (you guessed it  the massive anime  clich ~sweatbead~ is present and accounted for!). But when you enter combat, the graphics shift to show your party and the enemy in full-sized sprite designed glory. They remain atop 3D, polygonal backgrounds, but battle is steadfastly kept in side-view 2D, much like Namco's Tales of Destiny. With all of these visual styles going on in Thousand Arms, the mix is definitely unique and inspired. But, there are some problems with the framerates when traveling around town and on the map, making movement slow and messy at times. And though detailed and clever, the SD characters can look a little sloppy compared to the tight sprite compositions of characters in games like Suikoden II or Breath of Fire III. But, undoubtedly, there is a definite charm to the way Thousand Arms looks. The game's distinct anime style and the inclusion of some rather unique visual twists should more than make up for its graphic shortcomings. Anime fans will probably love this game for its graphics alone. GameplayThe brainchild of both Atlus (Megami Tensai series, Tactics Ogre) and Red Co. (Sakura Taisen), Thousand Arms incorporates both a traditional role-playing structure and a very distinctive niche sensibility. While the game plays much like a straightforward RPG for the most part, it's the quirky nature of its characters, battle system and dating elements that make it both appealing and strange (at least for those not familiar with dating sims and otaku-esque gaming) at the same time. Thousand Arms features plenty of the usual role-playing conventions, but manages to add a little of its own flavor to everything. From the quasi-realtime combat engine with its unique interface to the way in which you upgrade your weapons, it may take a while for even veteran role-players to get a grip on how to fight efficiently or manage inventory. And it's to this end that Thousand Arms ekes out its own niche in the genre. While some gamers may not take so easily to the way Thousand Arms is structured, it's undeniable that Red Co. and Atlus have at least tried to bring something unique to the role-playing category. The Spirit Blacksmith TradeMeis' role in the game is as not only the leader of the group, but also as the Spirit Blacksmith in training. By being a blacksmith, this means that Meis is in charge of upgrading the entire party's inventory of weapons by using his skills in the trade. So, how does this happen? Throughout the land, you'll find that most villages, dungeons and towns harbor Smithies that enable you to forge your weapons. But in order to forge a weapon, you must have a female in your group to imbue it with her own elemental power. Depending on the level of the weapon, her mood (as displayed by a ~Mood Meter~ consisting of a heart that can be filled in quarter increments for up to four to make a whole), and your level of ~intimacy~ with her. Sound wacky? It is and it isn't. Each time you forge a weapon, you consume a varying amount of MP, which is won from battles or found lying around different locations. Therefore, it's up to you to choose what type of elemental power you want to power a weapon with. Each female in the party possesses the ability to imbue weapons with different elemental powers, like Light (Sodina), Fire (Wyna), Earth (Kyleen) or Nelsha (Wind). You can make your choice dependant on what type of enemies you'll be facing or for the spells you're granted by different elements. You'll even be able to gain different ~Specials~ depending on which element you select. But you'll need lots of MP if you plan on really beefing up your weaponry at every Smithy and you'll need to save your MP for dating as well. All in all, the ability to forge weapons instead of the usual ~buy a new, more powerful (and more expensive) weapon at every town you come across~ method found in most RPGs is a clever and inventive step away from the ordinary in Thousand Arms. And the fact that you're able to choose how to strengthen your weapon, as well as which spells you can give to certain party members is a subtle stroke of genius. This way, you won't have to waste MP on a character that you never plan on using in battle until you have to. The Battle SystemOne of the most unique aspects found in Thousand Arms is its combat system. Though still tethered by the random battle conventions of role-playing, each time you enter a fight, you can bring up to three party members into battle at your side. The party is then broken up into two groups -- the attacking character up front, and two support characters in the back. During the fight, you must then enter in your command for your attacking character - we'll use Meis as an example. Meis has his own separate time gauge which, when activated, enables you to press the X button in order to carry out the command. Meanwhile, your two support characters rely on a different time gauge, and when it is activated will give them a chance to carry out an action. But, the front character is the only one able to attack the opponent with physical hits or specials. The support characters can only use items and magic spells to heal an injured party member. They can also use certain items to attack the enemy, as well, but that is the extent of their participation in battle. That is, if you don't count the special taunts that each character possesses. Taunts are special because not only do they add plenty of personality to the fight, but they also pack support abilities ranging from boosting the attack power of the lead character to lowering the speed of the enemy. And they're pretty damn funny to boot. And at anytime, you can dispatch the lead character in exchange for the next one in line in the battle party. While this option is barely ever a necessity, except for when your lead character is knocked out, it's nice to know that you can always rely on your backup. If you take into account all of these quirky, but unique elements, as well as some particularly dazzling specials (Meis' elemental Spirit summons may even rival some of those in the Final Fantasy series), Thousand Arms' battle engine definitely strikes out into new territory. But on the flipside, there are some drawbacks to the way you fight in the game. While clever and unique, the pace of battle can tend to slow down considerably simply because of the way the whole thing is set up. Since the lead character is the only party member able to physically attack the enemy, random stock battles will get pretty tedious at times and the entire structure doesn't provide for much flexibility. There just doesn't seem to be much movement on the battlefield to keep the majority of the fights (with the exception of the boss fights) particularly engaging or exciting. But with that said about Thousand Arms, these comments can be made about 95% of the RPGs on the market. DatingThough nowhere near a full-fledged dedicated dating sim, Thousand Arms does finally give Western gamers a glimpse of why Konami's Tokimeki Memorial 2 is such a highly anticipated game in Japan. As Meis makes his way through the game, he'll meet up with more than a few lovely ladies to woo. And woo them he must in order to not only boost his blacksmith skills, but to also live up to his Triumph name. Once you have a girl in your party and some MP under your belt, you can then visit a location in almost each town called a Dating Statue. When you do so, you're given the option to date any of the girls in your party and choose to either take them out on an actual date, give them a present or participate in a mini-game in exchange for MP. Depending on how bad or well the event goes, your Intimacy Level will either increase or decrease thus affecting your blacksmith skills. The success and outcome of the date also greatly relies on the mood that the girl you choose is in at the time you date her. If she's in a good mood, you stand a better chance at perhaps getting a kiss at the end of your date. If she's in a bad mood, you must be very careful to perform well and avoid generally pissing her off, lest you waste precious MP on the whole thing. Probably the most addicting and enticing feature in Thousand Arms, the dating segments are simultaneously fascinating and hilarious. Whether you're chatting up Kyleen by the docks, handing a present over to Nelsha near the fountain, or trying to successfully cook up a meal for Sodina in the mini-game segment, the appeal of the dating segments are compelling enough to force you to return to the Dating Statue in every town just to see what might happen each time. Taking your chosen lady to a scenic locale on a Date means answering a series of rigorous questions in hopes of choosing the right one to continue the conversation. Answer wrong too many times during the chat and you'll be left in the cold very quickly. The Present option enables you to bestow gifts on the lady of your choice, but you'll have to choose wisely or you may find yourself plummeting down the Intimacy scale in a big way. The same goes for the particularly wacky Mini-game option, which places you in different mini-games specific to each girl. If you score big, you might jump up a notch on the scale, but if not - you'll be headed in the other direction. While not exactly what we would call ~politically correct~ by Western standards, the dating segments in Thousand Arms are definitely a welcome change from the usual pace of role-playing. By treating it with plenty of humor and more than enough cheeky chatter to make an otaku blush, Atlus can be considered both gutsy and smart for scoring this game a release in the States. Just cross your fingers that this may pave the way for games like Tokimeki it's certainly not hard to see the appeal in dating sims after going on a few dates in Thousand Arms. SoundThough not necessarily the most standout element in Thousand Arms, there is something to be said about not only the voice acting but more notably the soundtrack in the game. The music is pleasantly modern for the most part throughout your journey as Meis Triumph, but not in a bad way. There are atmospheric pieces as well as enough catchy tunes to make you listen closer. But the biggest coup d'etat in Thousand Arms is Atlus' conscious choice to leave the opening track, as is -- Japanese lyrics and all. And the game definitely benefits by its inclusion -- adding an even more authentic and genuine feel to the anime style of the whole production. But unfortunately, the same can't be said about the voice acting in the game. While not reaching the horrid depths of say, Konami's Silent Hill or ASCII's Master of Monsters, some of the voice actors still come off as if they're reading from cue cards instead of sounding like rehearsed professionals. And there are a lot of vocal tracks throughout the game to get through, so you'll have to make do. Luckily not all the voice actors are inept. Quirks and PerksThousand Arms as a whole is a distinctly anime-type RPG, from it's character designs to the visual style to the themes that it explores. Quirky, unique, inventive and charming, it may not be the RPG to speak to the masses, but it will definitely appeal to those immersed in the culture of import gaming and the already converted. Squeezed onto two discs, and packed with a plethora of collectible goodies like a cloth map, trading cards and a soundtrack (yay!), it's difficult to forego a decision to buy this game for the mere fact that it's a bargain in its own right. OpinionThousand Arms is definitely a top-notch RPG in many ways in my mind. Interminably cute, incurably wacky, and hosting some of the most highly polished anime-style characters and cinemas this side of - well, anime... it's also really difficult for me to pinpoint why I can't score it higher than an 8.5. Though I had to take much of the dating dialogue with a grain of salt, (Oh, geez, what girl really asks these types of questions?) I found the dates to be surprisingly addictive and probably the biggest draw to the game. Who could resist choosing what you think is the ~bad~ answer in order to see what kind of reaction the girl would give? And who didn't run to the Print Club stand in each new town just to check out the new frames? Or how about trying to be smart in deciding which gift to give to whom? It almost feels like taking a really bizarre aptitude test and it left me wanting to try my hand at a full-fledged dating sim to see how clever I could be in getting the best possible outcome. In fact, the further I got into the game, the more and more I liked Thousand Arms. The variety of gameplay in certain areas and the game's overall sense of humor and light-hearted feel will no doubt win over its share of skeptics. But, for some reason, I felt that the characters were never really likeable enough to care deeply about  something vital to really establishing a solid framework for an RPG. Meis is an adequate hero for the most part (when he's not trying to get into some girl's pants, of course), but not nearly as endearing as someone like Rudy in Wild Arms or even Joie in Suikoden II. When Meis make valiant gestures in the game, it never feels natural or genuine. Even some of the girls in the party feel like cardboard cut-outs at times, with one dimensional personalities that never dive deeper than the caricature traits they're given at the outset (i.e. Sodina, the virginal girl-next-door; Kyleen, the fast-talking, gold-digging thief; etc.). But, I'd still whole-heartedly recommend Thousand Arms to any role-playing fan. Just be prepared for a game that may take a little while getting used to. While perhaps not a classic, it certainly does deliver the deeper you progress into the game.Francesca Reyes", "date": "Oct 16, 1999"}
