There are Fords, Pontiacs, Chevys and Dodges in America's fastest growing sport (it's been that for 10 years, you know) but it is amazing how similar these vehicles look both in real life and in NASCAR Thunder 2002. Overwhelming uniformity is, in fact, the theme when it comes to evaluating EA Sports' stock car racing sim. Why? Because nearly all of the real-to-life racing tracks are some variation of the oval. However, that is NASCAR and Electronic Arts has faithfully reproduced the high profile racing league down to the smallest details for Xbox fans.   The EA game is pretty much air tight, so if you have a problem with it, then you likely have a bigger problem with NASCAR as a sporting event.  Features:    Full 43 car field.  New rendering engine which includes 3D cockpit movement.  New career mode allows you play over multiple seasons.  New damage model.  Dynamic environment interaction.  Easy Play features for novice racers.  Four player multiplayer competitions.  All 23 NASCAR tracks.   Gameplay The technological magic of the Xbox has allowed both EA and Infogrames to achieve that Holy Grail of stock car racing sims --the full 43 car racing field. It used to be, way back in '99 that you could only get about 22 cars in a race but we're all about reality now. So real in fact, that you even get the custom paint jobs that different drivers use from time to time. Bobby Labonte, for example has nine different skins for his Pontiac that you can choose from, but most of them are green and feature a huge Interstate Batteries logo. I prefer the Looney Tunes motif that drivers like Jeff Gordon and Kevin Harvick have available because the Tasmanian Devil on a race car is funny.  The Career Mode, as with any other sim, is the backbone of NASCAR Thunder and the game mode diehard stock car racing fans will jump into first. You can race as one of your favorite real life drivers, but building your own racing team and car from the ground up will be a little more rewarding. Nothing better than seeing your own name at the top of the leaderboard and driving your custom made, custom painted racing machine. You get to choose from one of the American car makers mentioned above and then choose from all sorts of design and color options. All of the double and single digit car numbers --like  jersey numbers in football-- are accounted for in Thunder, so you'll have to pick one from 100-199. That may suck, but entering your real birthdate and hometown more than make up for that numerical limitiation.  Sponsorship is the key in Career Mode. You can select primary, secondary or associate sponsors a couple of times during your first season. Sponsors will put their logo on your hood (primary), trunk (secondary) or rear fenders (associate) and then demand that you meet certain requirements within a certain number of races or over a certain period of time before they will pay you. Some are basic like ~Finish in the Top 20 once in the next three races.~ Others are more personal ~Beat Jeff Gordon once in the next four races.~ The point is, they are all reachable goals at first, but they become more difficult in later years of your career. You'll have to maintain a certain level of excellence like ~Finish in the Top 5~ for a long period of time like 12 races (an entire season).  Once you get the hang of things --thanks to Thunder's flat learning curve-- you can agree to a sponsorship package where one sponsor will ~buy~ your entire car, slap it's logo all over it and pay you if you meet its multiple requirements. With packages, the sponsor basically owns your car so they will repaint it, renumber it and put you in the make of car that they decide, giving you one coherent advertising vehicle. With the individual primary and secondary sponsors for example you're still driving your created car but with an assortment of non-matching logos. I sold out and accepted a package with NBC Sports and let me tell you that rainbow and that peacock didn't make winning races any easier.  Sponsorships last for a certain number of races and when they're done you get the cash for a job well done. That money is what you'll desperately need to upgrade things like your car's engine, handling, braking and your team's pit crew. You'll need to upgrade too because Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt Jr and Mark Martin will always be your biggest competitors and they get upgrades as often as you do.   I have to admit one of the most enjoyable  parts of Thunder is tearing up the super delicate racing machines. The damage model is so precise that you can consistently tear up one corner of your hood --I usually do the right side from rubbing against the barrier-- and mangle it beyond recognition.   Speaking of mangling, you won't be able to go two laps in Thunder the first time you play it, without swinging your rig around and racing in the opposite direction hoping for a collision. This is a quick, harmless guilty little pleasure that will allow you to see the extent of the damage physics and the authenticity of the different tracks. I highly recommend if only so you can see how great the burning hunks of mangled stock cars look under a North Carolina sky at dusk.  Oh yeah, almost forgot about the racing. There are lots of left turns and all of the other drivers are extremely good so don't crash and pit when you see them pit. Once again, that is NASCAR and we're getting it in Thunder 2002.   Graphics Best looking stock car racing game to date, that's what NASCAR Thunder 2002 is. Lens flare isn't just a dated showboating technique in this game, it's a driving hazard when you're racing one of those dusk races and the sun is a blinding orange. And dusk does turn to night right before your eyes with shadows stretching and stadium lights turning on.  Because there are so few models to animate in stock car games, Thunder is certainly supposed to look as good and as detailed as it does. The sun should sink lower each time you come around for a lap and it does. You should be able to recognize that tools and actions of your pit crew as they work furiously on your ride and you can. Skid marks, smoke effects, fire and little bits of body work flying off of cars should all look and behave realistically, and they do. This kind of detail is possible now on the Xbox and there is really no excuse not to have every little bit of NASCAR realism on display.   The cool stuff is seeing your car warp and bend back into shape when you hit the L trigger to repair all of the damage you've caused to yourself; watching the Goodyear Blimp actually complete a circuit around the track; not being able to see the track anymore because of the haze generated from smoking tires. That's the next generation difference that Xbox promised and EA Sports has fulfilled.  Sound Engine noises and crew chiefs, that's all pretty much all you'll hear in Thunder. You will, however, hear your engine differently depending on what driving perspective you use. The cockpit view is pretty loud and the far chase camera is nice and quiet until other cars creep up behind you. Now I know what a stock car will sound like if I'm ever hovering behind one at 35 feet up in the air.  There's a certain ~twang~ to NASCAR Thunder 2002 that you'll come to appreciate as you play through Thunder. It pretty much comes from your crew chief's constant yapping in his southern accent and the original Lynyrd Skynyrd version of ~Sweet Home Alabama~ that plays on the menus. Unless you switch to the generic menu music, you will know the words to ~Sweet Home Alabama~ within hours of owning this game. It's really a lovely accessory when you first boot up the game, but EA put an alternative soundtrack in there for a reason. I think EA Sports nailed stock car racing with this Xbox effort. The only essential element NASCAR Thunder is missing is maybe a fight or two in the pits after a race. That seems to be a pretty exciting part of the sport since they show them on TV all the time. Either that or they should go all the way back to the sport's roots and have players smuggling moonshine across county lines. But that's all wishful thinking. For now NASCAR Thunder 2002 is as good a stock car sim as you're going to see, but the overall appeal of this game is truly a matter of taste.If you play videogames to escape the real world, then Thunder is only going to get you so far if you're not a diehard NASCAR fanatic. Sure you can go 200 mph in some marvelous machines, but 90% of the time you'll only be going in a circle on tracks that demand more raw speed than driving skill.  Put another way, there's a reason other racing games like Gran Turismo 2 always use ovals for test driving and it ain't for their level of difficulty. Thunder 2002 is an excellent stock car racing sim that cannot and should not moonlight as a mass appeal racing game.", "date": "Nov 9, 2001"}
