Set in the year 3000, the world's computers are getting bored with calculus and spreadsheet programs. What to do? Get rid of all humans and engage in weapon-equipped, virtual off-road races with animal-based cars, of course!  In other words: Super Computer Animal Racing Simulation. It all makes sense now, doesn't it?  The Facts  10 different tracks with alternate routes Changing weather conditions Nine vehicles to race (including Lion LK, Tiger Shark and Rhino Roadster) Simultaneous four-player split-screen races A plethora of weapons including missiles and ~hot potato~ mines Head-to-head, custom cup, ghost and special challenge gameplay modes Impressive 3D graphics engine with real-time light-sourcing effects   Gameplay Up to four players go head-to-head on 10 gorgeous tracks, ranging from a snowy mountain with ski lift to a futuristic military base, complete with UFOs and translucent bridges. Although S.C.A.R.S is Vivid Image's first Nintendo 64 title, the London-based developer managed to squeeze smooth framerates, vibrant colors and unprecedented lighting effects out of the hardware that put even Rare's efforts to shame. Especially the night races, where the tracks are illuminated only by street lanterns and the racers' headlights, are a sight to behold.    But S.C.A.R.S isn't only about eye candy. Vivid Image can look back on years of experience in creating addictive multiplayer racers, such as Street Racer (Super NES) -- and S.C.A.R.S  doesn't disappoint in this respect. During the races, players can pick up weapons and power-ups to boost ahead or take out the competition. You will find turbos, ~hot potato~ time bombs (toss them back and forth until they explode), barriers, magnets, missiles, and more. The one-player mode is already challenging enough, but plug in three more controllers and you will be playing into the wee morning hours. Sick of playing the same old Grand Prix over and over? Create your own by picking and choosing the tracks and take on your friends.    Unfortunately, S.C.A.R.S isn't without its share of problems. While there are plenty of shortcuts, there are equally as many invisible barriers that keep you from leaving the tracks. As a matter of fact, unless you get really good at handbrake turns, you will meet with many ~sticky~ walls that detract from the overall racing feel.  It's extremely annoying in the beginning, but once you learn the tracks and know the routes that lead through them, the gameplay turns out to be very rewarding. The physics engine could have used a little more work as well, as the cars don't feel significantly different when going uphill or hitting banked tracksides. The somewhat lazy physics engine becomes especially notable when racing on the one underwater track -- which feels just like all the other tracks.  In the end, those gripes don't spoil the gameplay fun, but they keep S.C.A.R.S from becoming an instant classic. Still, if you're bored with Mario Kart 64 or Diddy, rent it and see if you can live with   Graphics The graphics have a definite PlayStation look to them. While that means it all looks a little pixelated, the vibrant colors and pyrotechnic effects make this game's graphics stand out from many other arcade racers. The cars even possess subtle specular highlights (although you can hardly see them during the races) and their headlights illuminate the tracks at night. Especially some of the later courses are drop-dead gorgeous with snow flakes whirling through the air and many strange buildings and road features, such as a glass bridge or hovering UFOs. Overall, the graphical style is a bit strange though. The oddly designed ~animal cars~ don't quite fit to the more realistic tracks. It's a nice attempt at creating a style of its own, but the mixture doesn't work in our opinion. Still, awesome graphics, especially given the fact that this is Vivid Image's first ever N64 game.  Sound As impressive as the graphics are, the sound is simply atrocious. Instead of coming up with engine sounds that fit the animal-based vehicles, the racers in the game all sound like the same dying lawnmower. Cutesy sound effects also do little to bring home the cyberesque atmosphere of the courses and the background story. The music is equally weak, simply streaming off the cart without really adding to the game. Vivid Image has put together a good-looking battle racer that only has a few flaws: Invisible walls, the infamous dither filter, and horrendous sound. But once you get used to it, you will find a rewarding, highly addictive game. Especially the multiplayer modes stand out with smooth framerates and a high amount of detail. It's no Mario Kart, but I definitely recommend taking a look.", "date": "Dec 5, 1998"}
