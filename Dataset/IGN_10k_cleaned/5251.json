How does this isometric action-RPG stack up to the other two contenders in the category, JAMDAT's Neverwinter Nights and Sorrent's Baldur's Gate?  Pretty damn well, actually. Features:Isometric visuals15 levelsAction and puzzle gameplayGameloft doesn't make crap. It never has, and if its most recent batch of games proves -- Might and Magic, Vans Skate & Slam, and Prince of Persia Warrior Within -- it just doesn't have mediocrity anywhere in its corporate DNA. And nothing about Might and Magic betrays a desire to do anything less than create the best mobile RPG on the decs. Because that's what it is.  Now, there are two schools of thought in the wireless gaming community. American carriers are looking for big, flashy titles that offer copious gameplay and the kind of graphics that fuel handset upgrades. That's the kind of game Might and Magic is. However, when IGN Wireless visited Korea for DICON, simplicity was heralded at every meeting. Might and Magic is anything but simple -- but is has an ease of play that many puzzlers can't even boast. Might and Magic tells the tale of Ewan, a young adventurer in the land of Erathia. The world has been rended by a fierce battles between humans and demons, and in an effort to force mankind into checkmate, the demons have taken the human king hostage. It is up to Ewan to venture forth with his party of kinsmen to take down the demon threat, restore the king to his throne, and end this conflict once and for all. Might and Magic is an action-RPG, not unlike Fable or Zelda. Turn-based battles are a thing of the past as you must engage the worst of the demons in real-time combat. Demon-employed ogres, bats and undead will stop at nothing to leave your bones to bleach in the sun, so you must learn to dodge attacks and return fire to survive. And every monster has a weakness to be exploited. Some are as easy to a good cleaving between magical blasts, but others require a little more thought. If an enemy isn't allowing you to get in close, is there a way to break its defenses and make with the hack n' slash?  Between these battles, Ewan and his crew -- which include an elfin archer and a shape-shifter -- must use rudimentary puzzle-solving rationale to keep moving through the games 15 levels. Of course, simple thinking only lasts for so long. Within an hour or two, you really need to step up the cerebral activity and figure out how to use your team's talents to get through doors, cross crevices, and flip switches. Many traps require teamwork to solve -- other require special items be found and equipped to survive. Some of these hazards are accompanied by little hints to help you decipher the winning solution, but don't always count on the hand of Gameloft to help you out.  The control schemes offer you two ways to navigate this isometric fantasy realm. You use 2, 4, 6, and 8 to move about. Hopefully, you can quickly translate that pressing either 2 or 6 -- depending on your preferred set-up -- makes you move up-right instead of directly up or directly right. We're all used to pressing in the actual direction your character moves, so it's kind of unfortunate that Gameloft didn't add a third control scheme that assigns movement to the odd-numbered keys. Might and Magic is a stunner. Again, Gameloft is known for quality visuals, and Might and Magic certainly helps maintain the deserved rep. The character sprites are crisp and detailed -- and they have a nice assortment of animations. Monsters are also well-designed.  The backgrounds are also really nice. The winter levels are covered in bright, white ice. The ubiquitous fire levels have gurgling lava. Even meadows have their own grass texture instead of flat kelly green squares. Top-notch stuff. Might and Magic opts for in-game sound effects instead of a looping score. It's too bad the game cannot handle both, but it ends up being a smart choice for Gameloft to go with swordplay sounds rather than a MIDI string section on repeat. Might and Magic is a marvel. I wasn't sure how Sorrent's and JAMDAT's RPGs could be bested, but leave it to the good folks that made Splinter Cell to decisively do it. I think my favorite thing about Might and Magic, besides the visuals, is the way it treats the player with smarts. The hints keep coming until the game rightfully decides you should know better. And every time you find something new, you get a nice little blurb about its function. No guesswork here.With 15 levels, Might and Magic is sure to keep any RPG enthralled for as long as they cans tare at their phone. And Might and Magic gives plenty of reason to stare, as the game looks remarkable. I love that we're in GBA territory these days.The real choice now is if this is the mobile game for you. If you're a big RPG fan, this is a no-brainer. Part with your doubloons and make with the downloading. However, if you're the kind of gamer that players cell games in five minute spurts, then Might and Magic may not be your best investment. May we recommend Gameloft's Block Breaker Deluxe instead?", "date": "Nov 10, 2004"}
