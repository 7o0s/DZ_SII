The reality is that basketball videogames on the whole haven't quite reached the same level of quality that we've seen with sports like football, hockey and soccer and this can be clearly seen within the EA Sports family, as Live hasn't been as good as the company's NHL hockey, Madden NFL football and FIFA soccer titles in recent years.   It seems that the game's developers had this in mind, though, as they approached the development of the latest release in their top-selling basketball series, NBA Live 2002, with the mind-set that the game was in need of improvements in several different areas. Although, while it's clear that they knew of the biggest problem areas and addressed each and every one of them, the majority of improvements were only minor ones and didn't really add up to much in the end.  Feature Set The only improvement that would be considered major is the addition of the ever-important Franchise mode, which has been added to a staple of play modes that were in the previous version of the game including Season, Practice, Playoffs and 1-on-1.  The Franchise mode has become a must-have feature for any worthwhile sports simulation, so the inclusion of one in Live 2002 is fairly substantial. Best yet, it has a lot of nice franchise mode features and doesn't have the feel that it was thrown together at the last minute. Not only do you have the ability to customize the way the game is played and the length of the seasons in the Franchise, but you also have the ability to have every single team in the league be a user-controlled team, so it's possible to play with some friends and/or family members.  Additionally, the Franchise mode offers a nice set of off-season features including the ability to re-sign players, pick up player and participate in a multiple round NBA draft that makes use of a draft lottery to decide the top picks much like it's done in the real NBA. And when taking part of the rookie draft, you'll be able to access scouting reports for each available player that gives you information such as his projected round, attributes like height, weight, position, birth date, location, and school, and other cool bits of information including potential for development and a list of current strengths and weaknesses. A wannabe dynasty maker could literally spend hours sifting through the scouting reports of each of these players to find the one that he thinks is best suited to fill the needs of his current team.    The one problem that I had with the draft is that it wasn't that user-friendly in the way the menus were setup. The available players are in an alphabetical list that can't be sorted in any way. So, if you're looking simply to fill a point guard slot, you'll need to scroll through the entire list to see who the available point guards are. Likewise, it's not possible to sort by any other useful attribute such as height or projected draft position. It's only a minor grievance, but one that's hopefully addressed in next year's game.  Outside of this flaw and problems in general with poorly laid out menus that are often hard to navigate (it's a pain in the ass sometimes), Live 2002 is about as jam packed with features as a sports game can get and is on par with the latest releases that EA Sports has had to offer in these areas, including NHL 2002, Madden NFL 2002 and NCAA Football 2002. And it goes well beyond just the play modes.   Live 2002 has a very deep create-a-player feature that allows you to make a player with various sizes and with different customizable parts and features including things like hair color and style, face shape and size, whether or not he has tattoos on his biceps or forearms, and even shoe type. You can even have the guy where old-school James Worthy-like goggles or socks that come up to his knees, if that's what you wish. It's quite deep and the ability to edit players extends beyond just the ones you create, as you can tweak the hell out of current ones in the league. Although, much to my disappointment, editing players is limited to the player's position, jersey number, accessories and skill ratings, as you cannot mess around with the facial features -- so, you can't put a goatee on MJ if that was what you were looking to do.   Gameplay Even though something like a Franchise is considered a must-have feature in a sports game, it obviously is secondary to gameplay and this is the area where the improvements that have been made to Live 2001 aren't quite as significant in nature. It's obvious that the people making this game knew of the problems and put forth effort to improve the game in these areas, but what was done just isn't enough.  One of the biggest control issues with last year's Live was that movement was a bit sluggish because many of the move animations were too slow or just too long. Players would go through an excessively long animation for taking a simple jump shot, spin moves were exaggerated, drop steps in the post left you out of control for too long, and things just never moved as quick as they should in a game like basketball where everything happens insanely fast.  But even though each of these problem areas has been improved, the improvements are all fairly small in scale and might not even be noticeable by some. The only of these spots that has been improved enough where it's no longer a big issue is with the length it takes to shoot a jumper, as the timing of the player taking the shot is about right when you compare it to reality.   The other areas on the other hand, still are major concerns. The animation for a spin move, while a bit tighter and quicker moving than it was in Live 2001, is still a bit overstated and because of this, the move is pretty useless and will often take your player unwillingly out of bounds. And it's pretty rare that you'll ever be able to use any of these moves, whether it be the spin move, crossover, juke or between the leg dribble, to actually get around a defender because they happen too slow and often leave you without control for a brief period after the move is completed.  This moment of being out of control is most noticeable when doing a spin move of drop step when posting up a defender. Once in the spin animation, there's no way to stop and pull up for a jump shot, as you have to wait until the full animation is completed, which often allows beaten defenders to recover. Because of this, the post game really leaves a lot to be desired. Sure, there might be good moves that you can actually control in the post, including a hook shot and fade-away, but the quick drop step and shot is one of the most often used post moves down low and it's almost completely useless here because of the problem with getting stuck in an animation.  The in-the-paint problems extend to another very important facet of basketball, which is rebounding. You will find that it is easier to get in position to grab rebounds manually than it had been in the past and that you'll be able to snag some boards in the air while you jump, but the mass majority will still be picked up unrealistically off of the court. Boxing out is almost completely non-existent, too, as it's really hard to do it when you're in control of a player and the players that you're not controlling don't even seem to try. Because of this, you're going to find that there'll be an overabundance of offense rebounds by both you and the CPU-controlled team you're playing against.   While in the NBA you'll generally find that defensive rebounds outnumber offensive ones by about a 3-to-1 margin, you'll find that it's a bit more evenly distributed in this game and in games where a lot of outside shots are taken or shooting percentages are low, the number of offensive rebounds may dwarf that of the defensive rebounds.  These discrepancies with the typical in-game statistics with those in the real NBA can also be seen in other areas, including both steals and blocked shots. If you play a full length game, you can expect to get about five times the number of steals and blocked shots that you'd see in a real game, while scoring about the same number of points. This, however, doesn't really hurt the game as much as the rebounding, as at least in this case it's an issue of you actually making the extra steals and blocked shots instead of it just happening because the AI doesn't react correctly. Plus, being overly aggressive with steals and block shot attempts will usually put you in foul trouble early if you're playing with longer period lengths, so there's at least some kind of a drawback for the increased defensive stops.   A much less forgivable flaw is the Live's near complete lack of a transition game. When you're on a fast break, there's no such thing as a two-on-one or a three-on-one where you can quickly pass it back and forth between teammates or fake a pass to get the defender going the other way, allowing you an open lane to the hoop. Your CPU teammates won't aggressively attack the basket and even if they do, passing is simply not quick enough, so most fast breaks end up being a one-man attack that ends in a dunk or lay-up.   Likewise, things are even worse for the CPU's team, as they rarely take advantage of fast break situations and will often pass up relatively open lanes to the basket, whether playing on the rookie, starter, all-star, or superstar difficulty settings. Instead of going for the hoop, they'll slow down, stop, or pass the ball to yet another player that's not aggressively attacking the basket. I'm sure you wouldn't want the computer to always make a strong move to the basket every single time there's an opening because it might make for too difficult of a game or an even more realistic game, but fast breaks are an important aspect of the game and the computer should take advantage of opportunities more than it does here.  Yet another problem of concern with the control is with regard to the play calling. Whereas the plays available are pretty abundant and actually work well at times and add a lot of play depth to the game as mastering some of them will help you get more open looks in a realistic fashion, the method of calling them is completely junk. In order to call an offensive or defensive play set, you must press and hold the SELECT button plus the corresponding controller button that you've mapped to the play you're trying to call. The problem with this is that it's impossible to call a play and move at the same time, leaving you completely open for a steal whenever you try to call something.   And while there's a lot of offensive plays available, the defensive plays are limited and don't even include any zone defenses, which is now legal in the NBA thanks to some recent rule changes. The rule changes themselves, which include the elimination of the illegal defense, a defensive three-second lane violation and an eight-second rule to get the ball past mid-court, are all actually represented in the game, but since zone defenses can't be called, the only affect is that it's possible for you to manually do things like double team guys without the ball without fear of an illegal defense penalty.  A lot of these problems might each seem pretty small, but the end result is a game that just doesn't feel completely right. Don't get me wrong, though. Live 2002 is still fun to play, offers up a good multiplayer experience, and has a Franchise mode that is worth giving a shot, but it simply fails to capture the true essence of the real-life sport of basketball. And if that's what you're looking for, you're not getting it here.  Graphics It might have a lot of niggling problems as far as gameplay is concerned, but the good generally outweighs the negative in the other facets of Live, including its visuals. It's not a huge leap over last year's title, but it was already a good-looking basketball game and at least for now, Live 2002 is the best looking sim-styled basketball game that you'll see on any console.  You're not going to see any earth-shattering improvements with the player models, but they are improved. The skin looks a little less ~plastic~, body parts are a little more rounded, there are more realistic accessories, players have life-like tattoos, and the player faces look a lot more like the real guys -- though, there are some that are completely off.   The court also looks great and you're going to see realistic shadows and reflections of the players on the surface of the court. The net animation is good, the rim and backboard move and the players' shoes look good. Plus, there are fully 3D and animated players on the benches and 2D, animated people in the crowd. On the downside, there aren't any 3D referees on court during gameplay and you won't see any coaches walking around on the sideline.  The game offers four different camera angle options that can each be tweaked a little, with some having the option of zooming it in or out or having the angle reversed. The base camera, called Live, is different than what the series has offered as a default in the past as it gives you a vertical look at the court and pans a little back and forth to stay behind the action at all times. It works really well, but if it's not to your liking there's also three other views including a Court view that follows directly behind the player with the ball, a Press view that has the camera stationed at a spot in line with center court that pans left and right, and Wire view that follows the action from the side.  Where you'll notice the most improvement is with the animation for dunks and lay-ups. There's a plethora of new dunk and lay-up animations, and the dunks in particular help add a little more excitement to the game. With the larger variety of dunks, you're less likely to keep seeing the same old dunks over and over again and the new dunks that are available pack a lot more punch and look damn good. Sadly, dunks don't seem to vary much from player to player, but until they get around to mo-capping the entire league, we might have to deal with this for a long time.  A problem that I hope we don't have to deal with much longer, though, is the problem with the game's transition animations. While the mo-capped special moves, dunks, and lay-ups all look fine enough, the animation that blends everything together is really weak. Because of this, the game has a very choppy look to it, as player unrealistically jerk from move to move, so as soon as you think you're watching a real guy on the old tube, the game quickly slaps you in the face with some bad key frame animation, letting you know that it's just a game.   Sound The sound is probably the game's strongest area, but not because it really excels, but that it just doesn't bring up as many problems. The general play-by-play and color work are good and get the job done. It's never really all that exciting, you won't notice much in the way of advanced commentary that mentions what happened earlier in the game or that's related to the players' stats beyond just the game you're playing in, but it's never annoying and doesn't hamper the game in any way.   The crowd noise is actually a lot better than it was in Live 2001, but still not quite as dynamic as I would like. It sounds a little more like a real live crowd than just some constant noise in the background, though, and it helps create a better feel of being at a game. It would be nice if it reacted a little better to changes in the game, though. Here's where I try to wrap things up and basically summarize what the preceding text proclaimed. When you come right down to it, NBA Live 2002 is an improved version of the 2001 game complete with all of the prerequisite updated rosters and rules. It's a shame that the game doesn't allow you to use zone defenses, as is now permitted by the new NBA rules (which are used in the game), but this omission is sadly only one of the smaller of the game's negative issues. Even though player control is tighter than it was in last year's game, there are still way too many moves that leave you out of control for much too long, with the spin move being the biggest perpetrator. There's still an overabundance of offensive rebounds and steals and you're still going to see CPU controlled players do stupid things like pass up wide open lanes to the basket. It might be improved, but the Live franchise still has a far way to go before it reaches the same level as EA Sports' NHL, Madden and FIFA games. That said, those of you who enjoyed NBA Live 2001 or have been a fan of the series will likely find this game to your liking. It plays better than it did last year, there aren't as many bugs, and the addition of a full-featured Franchise mode will likely make you smile with glee. Just don't expect any significant improvements outside of the feature set, because you won't find much.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
