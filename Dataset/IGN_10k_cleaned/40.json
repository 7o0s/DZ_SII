It was Columns III, the follow-up to the original Columns, and my overall opinion was that it wasn't as good as its predecessor. I asserted that puzzle genre sequels rarely, if ever, outclass their original installments, as it's just too difficult to improve on established puzzle designs. Well, it's time to reverse that opinion.   Or at least make an exception  because Puyo Puyo 2: Tsuu is every bit as good as the first Puyo Puyo, and beyond that it actually improves upon the original design by adding in several modifications, tweaks and tricks that help make it a more balanced game (all without defeating the appeal of the initial design). Those other puzzler series might have only gotten worse after their first editions, but for Puyo Puyo the second time was the charm.   First up, the basics. Puyo Puyo is a one-on-one vs. puzzler that presents you with a pit full of multi-colored blobs. The blobs fall from the top of the screen in joined pairs, and your task is to position them in such a way that four or more of the same color end up touching each other  when they do, they disappear. Blobs that are left hanging in mid-air after the disappearance of other blobs below them will then immediately fall, filling in the gaps left behind and sometimes creating new matches. The trick to winning in Puyo Puyo is to take advantage of that fact, and try to set up your stack so that when you finally set off one complete group of four, the resulting avalanche causes a chain of multiple further matches and rains down garbage on your opponent.   Anime-styled opponents desire your destruction.  Where Puyo Puyo 2 begins to change things is in how it handles the effects of chains, as garbage sent to your opponent's side of the screen can now be countered, negated or even bounced back to you. For example, if you send 30 blobs' worth of garbage to your enemy, he or she will have a short period of time to answer with their own chain of matches to counteract it. If they manage to score their own chain worth 30 blobs, the garbage will be eliminated completely. If they only score 10 or so, the garbage will still hit them  it'll just be lessened a bit. But if they manage to totally trump your play and strike back with a chain worth 50 blobs, for instance, your attack will be broken and not land at all  and the overflow will fall back on your stack. Ouch.   So Puyo Puyo 2 becomes a battle of balance, as you can try to take a strategy of first strike to potentially pile up your opponent, but you risk that they'll be able to answer your attack and send it back at you. It's quite a change from the first Puyo Puyo, as in that edition the garbage you sent to an enemy always landed. There was no way for them to counter it, but there was also no way for you to counter trash heading your way either.   Another alteration here in 2 is the ability to now flip your falling blob pairs vertically  if a duo of dropping blobs is trapped on either side by stacked up columns, you can now double-tap the rotate button to spin them even though you don't technically have enough room to do that. It's not a major tweak, but one that helps out in the lategame.   Beyond all of this, though, the most important thing to consider in weighing out a potential purchase of Puyo Puyo 2: Tsuu is the fact that it's completely in Japanese. Totally untranslated, this download arrives as part of the American VC's Import category, as this particular Genesis version of Puyo Puyo 2 never made the leap to the States in a localized form back in the '90s. But the language isn't that big a deal here. The fact that every piece of text remains in Japanese detracts from Import games like DoReMi Fantasy because you miss out on a lot of dialogue and story scenes there  but this is a puzzler, and there isn't any real plot that you're missing. The story has something to do with climbing through a tower to fight the devil or somesuch thing. It doesn't matter. It's Puyo Puyo.The Puyo Puyo puzzle design first came to American home consoles in two forms  as Kirby's Avalanche for the SNES, and as Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Genesis. Both of those versions are available for download on the Virtual Console, and both are solid editions of the standard Puyo Puyo gameplay. But if you can handle investing an extra 100 Wii Points and don't mind the fact that this version's still completely presented in Japanese, then Puyo Puyo 2: Tsuu is a more balanced, robust and impressive offering. Kirby and Robotnik were good, but Tsuu is a bit better  and it's Tsuu's version of the Puyo design that has been utilized ever since its original release, in those more recent editions of the game that have managed to make the jump to domestic shores. Puzzle fans, give this one a look. It's the exception to the rule that all puzzler sequels are worse than their predecessors.", "date": "Mar 17, 2008"}
