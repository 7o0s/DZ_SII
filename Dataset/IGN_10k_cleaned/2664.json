Thankfully the promise of Dead to Rights and Soul Calibur 2 is more than enough to remind us that Namco is embracing Xbox and that this Smashing Drive, if we can in fact call it a game, is nothing more than an experiment gone bad. You can take the time to read our whole review or just check the results of our brief reviewer's checklist:Smashing DriveNumber of Players: 2Genre: Racing/ActionESRB Rating: TeenFun: no.FeaturesCompletely destructive, fare-driven gameplayLeave a path of destruction behind you as you deliver customers to their destinationsRace against an opponent cab driver, such as crashing through buildingsClear or even destroy traffic with your ear-piercing ~claxon~ hornGet power-ups including boosts, wings, and a battering ramTwo-player mode GameplaySo you're this cab driver, whom we never see, and you have to deliver these passengers, whom we also never see, all around New York City using all kinds of daring driving maneuvers and assorted power-ups. You compete against an AI driver, or a buddy if you can shanghai somebody into playing this disc with you, and the clock simultaneously in different segments. So you may be racing to reach Little Italy or Wall Street even though there are hardly any recognizable landmarks to let you know you're in those  neighborhoods.The powerups include the Cutter, Sonic Blast, Glider, Turbo, 4x4, Repair and Crash. They each behave in the manner you would expect except (that reads weird eh?) for the Glider. Your cab sprouts wings but it can't fly unless it goes off a ramp or jump, in which case the wings merely guide your slow descent back to the surface. All of the powerups with the exception of Repair, Turbo and Glider help you obliterate the pesky traffic that can be found on the streets of NYC. Shortcuts and powerups are what drives Smashing Drive and most of the time you will need to use shortcuts to find the cool powerups and you'll need certain powerups to access certain shortcuts. Either way the combination doesn't lead up to nearly enough fun. The physics of the cabs are out of this world, as in ~not like anything that we've seen on earth.~ The cars are floaty but with a hint of nuttiness. I have no problem abandoning realism for some good natured arcade fun, but Smashing Drive  doesn't offer much of the latter either. The sense of speed just is not there. Even though you can crank into turns hard enough to get up on two wheels, and you're encouraged to do so, there just isnt enough to do in terms of gameplay to sustain interest for more than 14 minutes. The truth is it will only take a few more minutes to actually finish Smashing Drive. The game was designed to eat the quarters out of the arcade consumer's pocket but that experience includes a seat, a neat steering wheel and lots of flashing buttons and lights. On the Xbox the value just isn't there.GraphicsWe first saw this game on the GameCube and the bright colors and simple looking models looked right at home on Nintendo's console. I don't know why we expected something different for the Xbox version, as if Point of View would suddenly conjure up some nice new textures and lighting where there previously had been none.The animation isn't impressive either. Beyond the little sequences where your vehicle transforms into its powered-up state, there's not too much moving around in Smashing Drive. When you do see pedestrians scurrying out of the way, they look like tiny flat action figures waddling to safety. Poorly drawn, yet animated Shrinky-Dinks is a good way to think of them. The fish-eyed camera gets annoying right away. When you get large objects on the screens like, say, a 747 landing right in front of your cab, the distortion near the edges of your TV screen can't be ignored.SoundWorst soundtrack ever.You know how a big corporation will get a tacky 1980s studio artist/band to cover a popular song when that big corporation wants to use it in a commercial, and your favorite song ends up pasteurized and watered down for the mass market? No? Well anyway the ~Smashing Drive~ theme is horrible on all levels because it sounds like somebody put effort into making such an annoying tune. It's not even a Japanese-pop type of suckiness,  just pure synthesized, acid-washed crap.The crashes and other sound effects aren't very effective and the attempt at surround sound is laughable. Heheheh. See?I wouldn't mind the fact that there are no other controls in this game besides gas, brake and horn (which can destroy your car if you abuse it) if that meant I had to use my driving skill to get by. On second thought, the music is far too irritating, as are the graphics, level design and user interface to sustain my interest. This game isn't fun at all and it does nothing with the Xbox hardware. Makes a good gag gift or gag rental, if there is such a thing.", "date": "May 14, 2002"}
