Intelligent Systems designed an incredibly challenging and thorough turn-based strategy game for the handheld that put all of the hardware's strengths to use, from its focus on multiplayer to its rewarding single-player campaign. The successful game has received the sequel treatment in the form of Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising, but players might be a bit concerned to see that not a whole lot was added to the existing design. It's a case of ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it~ which certainly works in favor of this follow-up...even if it's just a little disappointing to get more of the same in a newer package. Features Five different armies each with playable commanding officers Campaign and Skirmish Modes New Neo Tank unit Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cart) Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising is honestly not deserved of the ~sequel~ moniker. It's more of what's known in PC circles as an ~expansion pack,~ something that's not really possible in the cartridge world (except for maybe a piggyback cartridge like Sonic & Knuckles on the Genesis). So the developers did the next best thing: take the original game and tweak it with only slight upgrades in areas. The changes to the original Advance Wars aren't obvious, but they are there.  But just as Nintendo and Intelligent Systems lifted most of their assets from the original Advance Wars title for the sequel, it's only fair that we to do the same here by using the text from Advance Wars and updating it for our review of the sequel.

Get The Guide | Advance Wars Boards Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising  is an incredibly deep and addictive turn-based strategy game, where you assume command of an army that's out to reclaim a world that's been broken up by warring factions. The battle map is essentially a grid, and moving units is like moving chess pieces on a board -- each of your army's units can move a specific amount of spaces within this grid, and can only attack at a certain distance from specific enemies. Each of the dozens of maps in the game have their own specific task to complete, but generally speaking the fighting's never over until A) you've wiped out every enemy off the map, or B) you've infiltrated the camp and captured the enemy's headquarters. Advance Wars 2 adds to this by offering missions that require a specific task to complete; you'll have to take out a gigantic canon in one mission, or knock out a section of pipe in another. Fights will take place on land, in the air, and over the sea, and you'll have command over several different units...each with its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, infantry are needed to capture buildings in order to increase your war funds during the battle, but they're extremely weak and susceptible to attack from nearly any other unit in the game. Artillery Cannons can take out many units, but it can't attack any unit that's in its immediate area, nor can it hit specific anything in the air. Advance Wars 2 adds a whopping one single unit to the game design: the NeoTank, a much more powerful armored vehicle that is a bit costly to purchase during battle, but comes in extremely handy nonetheless.   It's important to learn how areas can change the effectiveness of an offensive attack or a defensive posture. Plant an infantry unit in the mountains, for example, and he can see through the optional Fog of War, as well as be relatively well protected from attack...it just takes an additional move to get into this area. Weather effects also come into play -- units are unaffected by pleasant conditions, but watch out when it starts to rain or snow. The level of strategy in this game is incredibly complex, and that's why the designers force gamers into a mission tutorial mode before letting them into the Campaign mode; it's a little awkward to have the same characters from the original game go through similar training exercises in the new game. But since the learning curve is extremely high, it's definitely a good thing that the tutorial mode holds your hand until, gradually, you go on your own against the enemy Command Officer.   And it's the Commanding Officer that adds an additional layer of strategy to the gameplay. As you move further into the campaign mode, more COs become available. The COs are your battle persona, and each one has his or her own strengths and weaknesses in battle. Some can move units further, but feature a weaker attacking ability; others can capture bases more quickly but lack strength in defense. Each CO also has a special offensive or defensive ability that can only be accessed when the powerbar has been given enough time to charge; one character can repair all his units at once, while another can strengthen every unit's offensive attack during a single move. In the sequel, there is a second tier of CO power, the Super CO power that is essentially an advanced version of the standard CO power; by letting the meter powerup beyond the CO power level, players can put the more intense CO power to use in battle. There are more commanding officers to control in Advance Wars 2 than in the original, and they're unlocked in the War Room as players move through the Campaign mode and spend the points they earn.  If you're feeling a bit on the creative side, you'll be able to design maps from the ground up through Advance Wars 2's very deep and detailed map creator. You have full control of what goes where, so you can potentially create as good as, if not better, maps than those already built into the game. These maps can be saved to cartridge, and then be traded to other players' cartridges and played over link cable. It's a great time killer creating some truly customized maps.     The original Advance Wars' presentation is extremely energetic with its very anime, and since the sequel uses many of the identical assets and effects the same can be said for Advance Wars 2. The game has very minimal animation in the well-drawn character sprites, but they slide around the board and battlefields with a fluid motion. The game takes advantage of the Game Boy Advance's hardware for its special effects, zooming the character and unit sprites all over the screen. The graphic style matches the game extremely well, since there's so much to keep track of -- the developers kept the clutter to an absolute minimum, and unless you've really screwed up a mission, it's very hard to lose your troops in a mob of units. Overall the gameplay in Advance Wars 2 doesn't miss a beat when compared to the original, and the sequel is just as fun -- if not moreso -- than the original with the subtle differences Black Hole Rising adds to the design. The strategy has been streamlined a little bit with incredibly slight alterations to the COs abilities, and the artificial intelligence has been bumped up to make the sequel that much more challenging. The Campaign mode has been altered so that players assume the different CO roles in each of the different armies throughout the storyline, instead of the original's sticking with one army throughout the game. The multiplayer aspect is just as addictive in Advance Wars 2 as it was in the first game, as Intelligent Systems put both the single-cartridge and multiplayer modes to work in the four-player options. The original title definitely kicked a whole lot of ass on the GBA, and it's the same with the sequel.  But the original Advance Wars had the luxury of having the innovation, being a unique addition to the Game Boy Advance library. Though the Wars series is not new to the market (it origins were in Famicom Wars), there was really nothing like it, not only on the handheld but also on the consoles. And it's just a little disappointing to discover that Intelligent System's didn't put a whole lot of effort into advancing Advance Wars for its sequel; the development team use many of the same sprites, background tiles, and, surprisingly, identical background music with only slight alterations and additions to justify the sequel's existence. It's really just an upgrade, not a sequel in the videogame sense of the word. The Advance Wars design is incredibly fun and addictive, and the sequel proves that the game design still works even if you've played the original to death. But you'll just have to keep in mind that the game is made for players looking for more of the same, not for players looking for ~more.~ It's such an incremental improvement over the original that the number 2 in the title honestly doesn't deserve to be there. But don't take this gripe the wrong way; Advance Wars 2 is still one of the finest games to hit the Game Boy Advance, and it's the version to get if you haven't been introduced to the stunning game design.", "date": "Jun 20, 2003"}
