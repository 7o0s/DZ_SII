Branded ~Survival Panic~ by Capcom, but called an adventure game by anyone else, Dino Crisis brings back the stylistic still camera angles, the multi-level labyrinthine structures, and the gallons of blood and gore with all of the shock and suspense that Resident Evil 2 delivered. Yes, RE2. Once you've played this RE, it's never quite the same -- or as scary -- again.   Dino Crisis has a different take than Resident Evil. Less sci-fi, and more adventure, less supernatural and more, well, Jurassic Park, Dino Crisis delivers a vicious, flesh-tearing fright than its originator. This new face in the Resident Evil library has loads of merit, and is a fresh and original game in many ways.  Story (Just to let you know there are a lot of comparisons to the Resident Evil series here. We tried half-heartedly to edit them out, but after killing, and then drinking the blood of the big, evil T-Rex, and howling at the moon all night, there was little holding back.) Players assume the role of the slim, red-haired military government agent Regina. She looks like a mixed Japanese-Caucasian with blood-red hair, and you can bet that she's worth looking at, from all angles, throughout the entire game. Along with a small band of similarly skilled agents, she begins this adventure by parachuting onto the island at night. You get to see one of them land on T-Rex's favorite lunch spot and then, well...we'll save that for you to see...and hear...and feel.   Dino Crisis takes place in the not-so-distant future on Ibis Island. At the heart of the game is the primary ~villain,~ 29-year-old Professor Kirk, a scientific genius, who apparently died in an accident some years before. New data suggests he faked the death and has now formed a secret laboratory to complete an experiment after his own country discontinued funding of the project. Kirk's research focuses on a revolutionary experiment to compile the ~Principle of Clean Energy,~ the ultimate energy source. He can take energy from the existing atmosphere and convert it to clean, useable energy. When this new source of energy is released, it can provide new life to our polluted planet, desperately in need of new power sources.   But there's a strange catch. Ibis Island is also covered with real live, real hungry dinosaurs. The once lush, virgin landscape is actually rampant with hungry Raptors, T-Rexs, and other Jurassic-era carnivores. Your mission is simple: find Professor Kirk, get off the island alive, and discover if there is any relation between Dr. Kirk's experiment and the dinosaurs.   Capcom does a brilliant job of telling a story through the medium of videogames. The little bits of information, followed by landslides, followed by deeper investigations, and then finally the big crescendo at the end is sheer genius. If ever Hollywood wanted to learn how to integrate story into games, all they would need to do is play through Dino Crisis or any of the Resident Evil games. (But shhh....don't tell anyone.)  Gameplay If you've played Resident Evil, you'll instantly feel at home playing Dino Crisis. Capcom's new dinosaur hunting adventure takes the RE paradigm and fleshes it out, brings new subtleties to it, and advances the game in weaker areas while adding new puzzles and strategy elements. But let's be clear about this (because we may not have been before), it doesn't create a whole new paradigm. It enhances and alters the one we all know and love.   Gamers will notice several new control abilities not found in the Resident Evil series that make this smoother and more satisfying to play. First off, Regina can walk and hold any weapon simultaneously. Believe it or not, you couldn't do that in Resident Evil or RE2, you had to enter into the inventory system to grab a weapon. It's a necessity to have your guns out here. The predominant dinosaur here is the Raptor, a fast-moving, vicious predator that you'll need to preempt whenever possible. Enabling Regina to shoot while walking is a logical step, and it's welcomed.   Players also can perform all of the predictable abilities available in RE, such as walking, running, picking up items, shoving large objects (shelves or boxes), using electronic devices, such as doors, computers, and switches, reading documents, spinning, and climbing stairs and ladders, etc.   The inventory system has been revamped, too. It may just be my imagination, but it seems you can hold more of the stuff necessary to keep you alive and well armed for most of the game. Two interchangeable screens list items and weapons. Both show up on-screen simultaneously and move much faster than before. Selecting and arming weapons is also quick and easy. By selecting weapons, two menus appear on-screen, a weapon and an ammo menu, both of which are instantly interchangeable. Not only can you enhance weapons, like adding new pieces to your handgun, but also the ability to mix rescue aid, or tranquilizers, to enhance their effects strategically deepens the game. Instead of using that last buckshot, use a tranquilizer dart in the shotgun, and put the dino to sleep for a while. In fact, I wish there were more of this kind of solution in the game. Too often, I find I have to run or shoot straight bullets to avoid becoming instant prime rib.   Storage is essentially the same as in RE. Instead of storing excess stuff in trunks, you get plug-based electronic retrieval systems. You need two to three colored plugs to open a storage area, and at any other area, you can retrieve the same goods you stored.   Where Dino Crisis is an improvement over Resident Evil 1 and 2 is its speed. It's much faster during the action parts of the game in many respects. Dinosaurs attack with such 'realistic' speed that players have to be constantly on the lookout for attacks. And of course, the carefully placed cameras set up situations where Regina walks around dozens of corners essentially blind. As for dino speed, with Raptors, you can run away from them, but they're just as fast as you and they can jump over fences and large crates, etc. With the T-Rex, it simply lunges at you and, usually, eats you whole. In one special instance, the Raptors team up on you, like they're believed to have done in their day, definitely assuring a bloody, horrific ending. If you're smart -- and have seen Jurassic Park -- you'll know what to do to escape.   What's especially challenging with the dinos is the way they surprise and fight you. They spring and pounce, they circle and snap, they knock and pin you down -- and they bonk weapons out of your hands. A Raptor may pin you on the ground and just like in, gosh we hate to say it, but just like in wrestling, you must rapidly press certain buttons to free yourself. A special blue arrow points to the weapon's location for you to pick up and fight back. There's none of this slow zombie stuff. These guys hungry and fast and you're dinner. It's a great new aspect that fits the bill perfectly.   Another strong element adding to the game's depth is the new branching points. In several places during Dino Crisis players will have to make a choice to follow one person or another, and each path leads to a different section, but later meets up with the central story. You don't miss major parts of the game by choosing one path or the other, but I wanted to play again and again to find out what happened along the ~other paths.~ Near the end, there are more crucial branches, and the story gets murkier and more complex.   Adding to the new fighting aspects are the quirky, mercurial puzzle systems. They're simple yet complex, changing as the game progresses. The key system (the DDK System) is based on discs. Players must locate a number of these, two for every door, to unlock new areas. But after a few hours, certain word games are added to lock systems, followed by a combination of word and number games, and so on.   In other cases, Regina needs to find fingerprints and an electronic, rewriteable access card to open up new lab areas. The discs lead to a hell of a lot of backtracking, which is annoying after awhile, and is one of the less stellar qualities of Dino Crisis (and for that matter, RE 1&2). But, at least in Dino Crisis, the save points are cleverly placed in between major areas, and the ventilation system enables shortcuts between the ever-extending territories you uncover. Several times when I needed to save, I stumbled upon a new save point. That's genius game design.  Other interesting puzzles include (but don't end with) colored battery matching, cranes and crates, and an odd pipefitting logic game that took this dummy longer than I'll admit to.   My biggest complaints with the gameplay are three-fold. With essentially four kinds of dinos in the game, once you've seen them all much of the thrill is gone. Adding to that is the dominance of the Raptors. The game is filled with what seems like 90% Raptors, 2% Pteradons, 5% T-Rexs and 3% Compies. There are tons of other killer dinos that could have made a stand here, like those weird spitting guys and loads of variations of Raptors and Compies that I saw in my first grade dinosaur books. So what the hey? Where are they?  OK, so maybe you'll be thrilled with the limited amount of dinos. I wasn't. But another big complaint -- the very complaint I fought against when Dino Crisis was first announced -- concerns the dinosaurs. After much playing time with Dino Crisis, I have to agree that these dinosaurs -- no matter how cool and new they are -- simply aren't as cool, scary, or creepy the way the zombies and totally weird sci-fi monsters are in the Resident Evil series. RE was creepy, dark, and scary. It gave me chills. Dino Crisis feels clean and sterile, and it's just not as scary. I looked forward to the new, totally bizarre creations that Capcom came up with in RE. Here, I am only half as scared because even when I am attacked, I know what the beasts are going to look like and do.   Last, but not least, is the smaller, less compelling cache of weaponry in Dino Crisis. It's not as large, and the guns aren't as cool. I don't want to ruin the whole damn list, but needless to say, it's not as impressive as the set in RE 1 or 2.  Graphics One of the reasons that I feel Dino Crisis is more sterile than Resident Evil is because there is less stuff cluttering it up. Being a guy with a generally clean desk, you'd think I'd like a less cluttered game. This game uses completely realtime polygonal backgrounds, environments, and realtime lighting. Gone are all of the Resident Evil-style prerendered scenarios. So I should be jumping for joy having said that, but the end-all result for me was that the ~clutter,~ or amazingly detailed prerendered backgrounds, were part of what made RE so unique, artful, so creepy, supernatural and organic.  But I can't deny that Dino Crisis is a great looking game. And there are great reasons to like the polygonal goodness. I mean walls and outdoor areas are all well textured, and the outside areas, in particular, are wonderful. The frame rate is steady when there are two or more dinos are on screen and there is almost no graphic glitching, seam problems, or bugs. This game is clean.   Last but not least are the new camera changes. While still, set cameras are the name of the game, much of time, a camera will follow you down a hallway or across a room, exactly like in a horror or action film. The result being a more fluid game with a better sense of control. What's kind of amazing is that you hardly notice it. It's that subtle. Shinji Mikami should have been in pictures.  Sound What's always been a great plus of the RE series and now with Dino Crisis is the eerie background sounds and stylized music. Just like in the movies, the action in Dino Crisis is heightened by sound effects and atmosphere. But honestly, at times it's not even music, it's just a wave of sounds that create a feeling. It works, but it's not MUSIC. I guess I'd take atmosphere over music any day, seeing as how ~alternative~ bands keep finding their way into just about everything.   The dinosaur sounds, while not at the Jurassic Park level, are awesome. The imagined sounds of every creature, from the little squeals of the Compies to the trembling roar of the T-Rex to the ripping of flesh, are extremely well done. As for the dialogue, well, let's just say that it's better when they don't talk. It's not as bad as Resident Evil (~since you're such a great LOCK PICKER~), but at times it reminded me that I wasn't watching a movie, I was playing a videogame. Awww well. Can't have everything.  In the end, the narrow view is that Dino Crisis is Resident Evil with dinosaurs, and the big picture view is that Dino Crisis broadens the vision that Resident Evil once conceived. I really like Dino Crisis -- and all of the changes it's made to what once was Resident Evil 1&2. In a way it's remarkable what's been done. In fact, I'm on the verge of loving it. But it doesn't scare me, and it doesn't creep me out, and it's not Resident Evil, so I should really stop comparing the two. The only problem with that idea is that Dino Crisis -- no matter how many changes or advances it's made, or how big it is -- is...well, Resident Evil...with dinosaurs.", "date": "Oct 1, 1999"}
