The miniature golf course was filled with long paths, windmills, water hazards, banks and hills that made mini golf challenging but fun. Superscape's Classic Mini Golf 3D takes those simple mini golf course mechanics and throws them right out the window, leaving you with a frustrating and unmemorable experience.   Classic Mini Golf 3D has a 50's vibe to it, from the course settings to the main characters dressed as extras from Grease. You can only choose the male character Bobby T when you first start out. Trixie is unlocked when you beat her in one of the game modes. There are five main courses to choose from with nine holes each but the later courses can only be accessed once you've completed the previous course. In order to complete the course and unlock the next one, you must be at or below the course's par total.   The courses themselves are the main problem I have with this game -- and that's a pretty big problem in a golf game. The courses range from a Jukebox theme to an old black and white Hollywood movies theme. There aren't just windmills or water hazards in your way. Instead, you sometimes have to hit switches, hit targets, time your hits to falling levers and obstacles, objects that block the path, pits, conveyer belts, rising and lowering walls, musical notes that push your ball, etc. Most of the courses are a complete mess and trying to get to the hole without going over par is a real exercise in patience. Before you begin, the camera pans around the hole giving you a bird's eye view of what could be in your way. Some of the holes were downright confusing and I had no idea which way I was supposed to go. I guess that's why trial and error exists. Control of your character is simple, but the power meter can be misleading. Sometimes you think you have enough power to get up a hill, only to watch the ball roll right back at you. Other times you hit it too hard and the ball goes flying off of the course. The ball's physics seem to be off, especially when you try and angle your shot. Luck, more than skill, seems to eventually determine your score.   Your main objective is to score as low as possible, but there is also a side objective if you choose to try and achieve it. On each hole is a special item you can collect. These items are usually out of the way and hard to reach, costing you strokes. Collect all nine items and you unlock a special tenth hole. Collecting all of the items within the time limit on this hole unlocks special items that you can use in the game. The items are putters that let you control the direction of the ball after you've hit it, a pencil with your name on it, or a watch to extend your time in the Time Trial mode. You can certainly go after these bonus items if you wish, but miss just one of them and you won't get the unlockable. You'll have to do the course all over again if you want to get to the tenth hole.   Getting all of the special items in the tenth hole also knocks 10 strokes off your final score, which can unlock the next course if you were way over the par total. I didn't like this added feature at all, and after unlocking the Bronze Putter I really didn't care to try for the other putters. The game is hard enough just trying to get to the hole. Now I have to worry about collecting special items as well? Mom's going to need a pallet full of soap to wash your mouth out because going after the special items while trying to make par can cause an avalanche of swear words to come spilling out of your mouth.   Another game mode is Saturday Night where you compete against Trixi to try and win her affection. This is done by trying to match her score and not embarrass her. If you pick up flowers that are on each course, you'll impress her as well. Trixie's dog sits on the course to mark where her ball is and you have to avoid hitting him. The dog may as well have been an elephant because my ball always seemed to find a way to nail him. After each hole, you'll know how Trixie is feeling towards you by the heart meter. Hit the dog and it goes down. Get the flowers and it goes up. Get the flowers and hit the dog in the same hole and the meter goes up, then down. Time Trial is just that, except you don't have to worry about strokes. You just have to complete the course in the shortest time possible. There's also a two player mode where you can hand the phone to your friend when it's his turn. Or throw it at him after your ball has magically leaped out of bounds.    The graphics are simple and cartoon-ish, and each course's theme has its appropriate look. Piano keys adorn the pathways of the Rock & Roll stage while cars whiz by on the Route 66 course. The sounds and music are non-obtrusive and can always be turned off if you think otherwise. The controls are very simple and easy to figure out. If you get a special putter, you have a certain amount of time after you hit the ball to try and control its direction. It's mostly useful for long putts if your aim is off.  While I do love a good game of mini golf, I'm afraid that one cannot be found here. It was a good try but the distracting special items, iffy ball mechanics and frustrating obstacles take its toll on you by the time you reach the third course. Take my advice and swing your putter somewhere else. If this game had sand traps like real golf does, Classic Mini Golf 3D would be stuck in it.", "date": "Sep 20, 2007"}
