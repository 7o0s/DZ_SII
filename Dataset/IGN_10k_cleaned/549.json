{"name": "Classic Bubble Bobble [GBC]", "name_review": "Bubble Bobble", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/17/bubble-bobble-2", "text": "You might recognize these little dinos as the creatures that supply the bubbles to that classic puzzle game, Bust-A-Move. But do you remember the game where these guys originated? That's right, it was a little game known as Bubble Bobble, released in arcades back in the mid 80s. These little guys flowed through the game, tossing bubbles at baddies and popping them with their spines -- it was a simple, yet addicting game, and it's seen versions for the NES, Saturn, PlayStation, PC...even a couple sequels on the Turbo Grafx 16. The Game Boy Color is an accurate rendition of the arcade game, but it's designed in such a way that the original feel is somewhat empty. It's still a great game -- it's just not as good as it once was.  Features Hidden worlds  Time Attack mode  Special powerups  For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  The game is very simple in design -- in each of the game's levels, you jump from platform to platform, blowing bubbles at the enemies -- if you hit them with a bubble, they'll be trapped for a few seconds, giving you the opportunity to ~pop~ them and put 'em out of commission. You can also group enemy bubbles together and pop them in a chain reaction for the most possible points. Collect the fruit left over before you're forced to the next level. And that's pretty much it. Oh, yeah -- you can pick up power-ups, like fireballs or cascading water to eliminate enemies in one shot. Did I forget anything?  For the Game Boy, the developer took the original screen of the arcade game and made it pretty much a pixel-for-pixel conversion. On the Game Boy screen, you may get the accurate-looking sprites, but the viewable screen is about a quarter of what you'd get on the original, forcing the screen to scroll to follow your actions. The problem here is, you can't see the creatures that are waiting for you to pop them at the top of the playfield. You actually have to hunt them down instead of actually seeing them up there. It's no big deal once you get used to the way the game plays, but I would have much rather had a version of the game that showed the playfield all at once. Sure, the detail would have been lacking, but at least I could see where my enemies went.  The other problem -- the game does not support two players to cooperate on the levels and compete for the highest score. There's no two player mode at all -- a shame, considering the arcade version encouraged two player participation. The writers explained the disappearance of the blue dino (he's sick, and the green dino is off to find a cure), but I still would have loved to link up with a friend to play this cooperatively.  Classic Bubble Bobble is a decent game, but its newer design issues fail to make it an accurate port of the game I used to play in the local 7-Eleven for hours on end. It's a definite keeper, but it could have been a much better conversion -- full screen mode and two-player mode are the  Classic Bubble Bobble is a decent game, but its newer design issues fail to make it an accurate port of the game I used to play in the local 7-Eleven for hours on end.
