Last year, Panzer General 3D really impressed me by combining a new 3D engine with the same turn-based gameplay that made the first two titles so popular. But then this fourth version came out with the confusing Panzer General III title. After playing the game for a while, I began to understand why the title was chosen. PGIII isn't all that different from PG3D and so SSI decided to stick with the whole ~three~ thing. But that's not to say that the game doesn't have some noteworthy additions.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the series, Panzer General is a turn-based, platoon level game set during the Second World War. You take command of a pool of leaders and units and must use them to wage a land war against your enemies. At the most basic level, Panzer General is about capturing and defending cities (although there are a few seek and destroy and breakout missions). Each unit and leader has unique strengths and weaknesses and you'll need to develop the separate units within your army into an effective fighting force. But enough with the general stuff already. Let's talk about this game.  The game is set in the Eastern Front. The four campaigns allow you to recreate the battles waged as the German and Soviet armies marched against both Berlin and Moscow. You can play either of the two Russian generals (Zhukov and Konev) or the German generals Guderian and Manstein. The leaders and units that you use persist from mission to mission within the campaigns allowing for a greater sense of progression and unity within the campaigns. There's also a new strategic map for each campaign. This new map feature allows you to pick and choose your own path through each campaign. Each completed mission branches off into several other missions, each of which has its own branches.  Following on the success of its predecessor, PGIII maintains the same sense of leader management. You begin the game with a pool of leaders that grows as the game progresses. Each leader specializes in a particular equipment class. Any leader can control any type of unit, but you'll do better to assign leaders to the equipment class they specialize in. That way they can take advantage of several special abilities. As each leader is involved in combat, he has the chance to receive special equipment specific bonuses. They are then eligible to obtain new general bonuses that apply to all units under their command regardless of type. You also get promotion points to spend depending on how well you do in the individual missions. These points can be awarded to your leader to allow them to take more actions during a turn.  The second biggest strength of the game is the unit design itself. There are over a hundred impressive new units in the game. It's not so much the appearance of the units, which isn't all that much improved, that's so refreshing but more the sense of different unit abilities. Tanks, infantry and artillery must be used appropriately or you'll be wasting your units and putting your leaders at risk. But it goes deeper than that. You've got recon units that you must used to spot enemy units. Then once your artillery and bomber units diminish enemy resistance, your tanks and infantry can move in. Fighters, anti-tank units and air-defense units must act to screen your other more offensive units. And remember how all the units looked the same in PG3D? Well now the overhead map lets you see a unit's equipment class as well.  There are a few more changes to the game that make things a little easier. The auto-deploy feature removes the need to place each of your units before a battle. In all the auto-deploy feature tends to separate units too much for my tastes, but I'm a concentration person. The pop-up windows that describe your units and leaders are also a little friendlier than they were in the previous game but it would still be much nicer to see the abilities of all of your units and leaders at a glance. It would also be nice if you could see more than six units at a time in the toolbars within the missions. Whatever.  Even though the units haven't been improved in terms of appearance, the game map looks a lot better. Although there are still no real 3D elevations, there's a much higher detail level on the game maps. Cities are pretty generic and there aren't that many notable landmarks but since the game adheres to a board game experience, you can't really complain that the map design is simplistic. I wish there was more of a sense that the map was an actual real world location (the forests are just dirty blobs on the ground, for instance), but I guess you have to take what you can get. The new snowy maps for the Eastern Front are a nice way to break up the monotony of the washed out maps of the earlier version. And speaking of segues...the game also has some new weather effects. Rain, snow and fog can impair the ability of your units to do battle, especially the bombers. The snow is particularly nice.  So in the end, PGIII isn't as much an improvement over the previous title than PG3D was. But hey, why mess with a good thing? We'd like to see more range in the camera in terms of angle and zoom, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the game. There are still some small problems with the selection of aerial units since they sit high above the space they occupy but again, this is a small issue. This has been a really impressive series all the way through and this latest version lives up to standard set by the previous versions. If you're a fan of turn-based games or the Second World War (and who doesn't like the war?) then PGIII is definitely worth your attention.  -- Stephen Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
