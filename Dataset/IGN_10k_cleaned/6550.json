Obviously, there is no way to recreate the point-and-shoot interface of a cabinet on a cellphone, so it was up to Namco to craft a control scheme that would render the fast-paced shooter playable on the smallest screen. While it is impossible to claim that nothing was lost in the transition from arcade and PS2 to mobile, Time Crisis Mobile captures the essence of the games quite well and ends up being a very fun experience for mobile gamers looking for something to offset their favorite puzzle and word games.   The game is accompanied by some semblance of plot, with you as an agent of the VSSE, forced to shoot your way to the heart of a terrorist-controlled facility and take out the ring leader. You can follow the plot through the Story Mode, or opt to take on a collection of Crisis Missions that are unlocked by satisfying in-game challenges, like scoring over 200,000 points in Story Mode.   Once the game is underway, you find yourself behind cover outside the complex. Enemies pop into view in the far background, as well as incredibly close to you. Some enemies can be dropped with a single shot, while others require multiple slugs. A small meter over their heads empties out as you shoot them over and over. To avoid getting shot, you must duck behind objects in the environment, such as walls or boxes. When you have cleared out the enemies around your current position, the game automatically moves you to the next position and helpfully starts you off in hiding.   Time Crisis Mobile offers two control options. One gives you control over an on-screen cursor that you must maneuver towards targets. When the cursor gets close enough to an enemy, it automatically locks on to it, and you can start shooting. This is somewhat iffy, and not recommended. Better is the grid method, which divided the screen into nine squares, and associates each square with one of the nine number keys. If a terrorist thug pops up in the center square along the bottom, you press 8 to fire. To toggle between ducking and stepping out to fire, you press 0. This method works exceptionally well, especially if you know your handset well enough to dial numbers without looking down at you thumbs. Seriously, without that second control option, I doubt I could really recommend Time Crisis Mobile.   On a test LG VX8100, Time Crisis Mobile looks great. The game is in full 3D, and the texture work here looks much better than Namco's previous 3D effort, Ridge Racer. The environments are hardly empty, the enemies nicely animated, and your movement through the levels is very smooth. Enemies that pop up right next to your current position really fill the screen and are well-constructed. I was also struck by just how colorful the game was -- in general, this is just a pleasing game to look at.   The audio is a mixed bag, however. You can choose to either listen to looping audio or the sound effects. Go with the effects. The music clip is quite short and, after a few plays, gets a little tiresome. The gunplay, on the other hand, sounds fine.  Time Crisis Mobile uses a smart control scheme to bring the arcade experience to handsets without too much of a loss in game play. Sure, there's nothing like actually playing with a real-deal Namco GunCon, but using the number keys sure beats moving a cursor around the screen. The production comes together very well, with extra content in the Crisis Missions, as well as a Story Mode that is no push-over. If you're looking for an action game for your 3D handset, Time Crisis Mobile is certainly worth consideration.", "date": "Jan 12, 2006"}
