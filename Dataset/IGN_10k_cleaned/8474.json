Taito's Space Invaders has appeared on dozens of platforms, from coin-op to the Nintendo DS. It's even ~invaded~ mobile a couple times in the last four years. But now a new port of the arcade original is bowing, so the classic is revisited again.   This is Space Invaders with absolutely no tweaking. The game aims to replicate the original, right down to the colored overlay that turned the black-and-white monitor into a Technicolor display. The aliens still march down-screen in lockstep, an endless assault that renders the player claustrophobic if they fail to keep them at bay by ducking out from behind bunkers to return fire.   The only thing that is missing is the soundtrack of the alien attack, the ever-intensifying dirge. The exclusion of the sound effect is a serious blow to this package, as the noise was a huge contributor to the game's signature tension. And think on this... one of the first games ever reviewed on IGN, back in March of 2003, was Space Invaders. That edition didn't have the dum-dum-dum of the descending aliens either. What gives? There have been four years of mobile advancements and the handset we tested the game on -- an LG VX8100 -- is lightyears ahead of the old Samsung N400.   Space Invaders does give you the option to start with extra bases and lower the bonus threshold, but that's as far as Taito goes with any sort of update. Otherwise, this is Space Invaders for the purist.   This is the same Space Invaders that launched a pop culture phenomenon three decades ago. Unlike Glu Mobile's recent update to Centipede, which offered new backgrounds and extra play modes, this is a strict port. It's also pretty much the exact same game released four years ago -- and four years is a lifetime in mobile. Unless you have an irrational hankering to bust those aliens in a minimalist package, take a pass. Even though the core game is still endearing, you deserve a little extra for your download dollars.", "date": "May 15, 2007"}
