For over a year now, N64 fans have awaited the wacky follow-up to the excellent World Driver Championship from this talented and successful studio with only heartbreak to show for it. Having first survived a name change (from ~Stunt Racer 3000~ or SR3K), the title was then thought to be cancelled by publisher Midway and not scheduled for retail sale. Many had followed the progress of this game through the companies' developer diaries on its website and were pretty disappointed by the news, for sure. Well, all hope is not lost, as out of the clear blue we find Stunt Racer 64 now resting happily on the shelves of rental stores across the U.S.  In what is becoming a trend for most lackluster N64 titles, this title has been deemed a ~rental only~ cart. Meaning, don't bother looking for it at the mall; it's not for sale kid. However, SR64 certainly looks to be at the top of the rental-only crowd -- the game honestly deserves a lot more credit than it's getting from its publisher. And despite having joined one of the most competitive genres on the N64, this little racer has turned out to be a good one. SR64 looks to add a few wacky twists to standard racing affair, putting it side-by-side with games such as the San Francisco Rush series (also by Midway, oddly enough). Let's take a look at precisely where this title shines, and where it just sort of sparkles.  Features  1 to 4 players simultaneous Futuristic arcade racing with a retro twist, including both aerial stunts object collection Three modes of play: League, Quick Race, and Practice Extra stunt modes including Half Pipe and Stunt Bowl 12 tracks and 12 cars, with extra goodies left to find  Optional high-resolution letterbox mode Designed for the N64 Expansion Pak Rumble Pak support Save data via N64 Controller Pak  Gameplay It's pretty easy really: A button for gas, B button for braking. And let's not forget about the Z button for boosting. Master that strategy, and you'll be a SR64 champ in no time. But don't think this basic control scheme takes away from the fun of the game. Anyone who's already played one of the Rush games will tell you that simplicity is what helps keeps it fun.  As far as a pure racing game is concerned, SR64 is really very simple. Don't expect to use your brake button for precision power-slides or gear-changing speed reductions in anticipation of hairpin corners. This game is a departure from World Driver Championship in every sense of the word. The tracks are really laid out in a very head-on fashion where you can simply release the gas if a sharp turn should every cross your path. You'll even find the occasional hidden shortcut or jump to send you zipping past the pack. Most of the time, however, you simply cruise down the long and hilly straight-aways and glide through the gentle extended curves as you look to jump through rings and collect coins.  Yup, you heard us right -- coins. How else are you going to buy upgrades for you car? As part of the SR64 experience, players must not only race against the five or so other AI competitors, but also try to collect money in three different ways: coins, rings, and doing stunts. Each stunt you pull off will have a certain dollar value attached to it, and the more tricks you bust, the fatter your wallet -- it's that simple. Players can then purchase upgrades to their hot rod between races such as engine tune-ups, better tires, more boost power, etc. This all seems to work nicely in the game and gives the player a reason to stick with the League mode besides simply ~to win.~  The car physics also seem to be good -- most cars handle smoothly and feel appropriately heavy as they fly through the air. It's inevitable that SR64 be compared to San Francisco Rush 2049 in the stunts department, so let's just get this over with: Rush is the clear stunt king. While SR64 does offer a few crazy flips and twists, it just can't compare to the variety of wacky maneuvers capable in the latest Rush. Honestly, as nice as the physics in this game can feel, they just didn't end-up being very stunt friendly. The only time you'll pop a flip is when you pass the pre-determined course ramps and use a boost. There's very little over-the-top wall bouncing action in this game, and being the stunt fans we tend to be, we were sadly disappointed.  But otherwise, the gameplay is fairly solid. A few minor gripes here and there with the menu systems exist, and the lack of an in-game controller pak management system is always sure to annoy. But really, SR64 is a fun little title to play, and the best reason is yet to come.  Graphics That's right, you guessed it. Boss Game Studios does it again with perhaps one of the slickest set of racing visuals we have seen on the N64. If you liked the crisp graphics of World Driver Championship, you're going to love the eye-candy in this game. Remember, this game is not set in the beautiful rolling countryside of Europe. This race takes you through the crazy imagination of a five year-old kid, and the visuals are a real treat. Slap in your N64 Expansion Pak, kick the optional high-resolution letterbox mode, and let the drooling begin. The textures rock, the colors pop, and the reflections shimmer. Well, they're not actual reflections, but they look great regardless.  And the best part of it all: the framerate is slick. What a great combination -- graphics and framerate, holding hands and skipping along merrily in sweet unison. Yes it can be done, folks, and yes, Boss Game Studios has proved it again. There are the occasional stutters, but this game is 95% chop-free with virtually no pop-up or draw-in to be seen. And it doesn't stop there. As you race through the tracks, you'll notice awesome five-story tall animals, bouncing buildings, and psychedelic clowns -- all animated for your gaming senses to be nicely aroused. Unfortunately, the high-res mode chops entirely too much off the top and bottom of the screen to enjoy some of these treats, but the full-screen mode is really worth it to catch them all.  Sound Well, if you've been an N64 gamer up to this point, then you realize that there's just only so much that you can do when it comes to the audio department of its games. A few titles have managed to push this barrier to the limit, but SR64 isn't one of them. It's not horrible stuff really, but there's nothing to get you excited enough to make you want to crank up the old home theatre. The car effects sound average, and the music is appropriately wacky to compliment the entire wacky layout of the stages.When I first heard that Stunt Racer 64 had hit the local Blockbuster down the street, I was admittedly less than thrilled. I managed to drag my sorry butt down there and slap down my membership card thinking ~Well, let's just get this over with.~ And for that, Boss Game Studios, I am truly sorry. After having actually played the game now and getting sucked into the League play a bit, I've realized that this game has a lot more going for it than the generic title it sports. It could have easily been brought to the retail market and done fairly well, except that Midway already has its latest Rush title out there as competition, and that's probably not smart business.But the good news is that all the hard work and developer diaries have not gone to waste, and gamers who are interested in some stunt racing action on the N64 can head out and give this title a rent sometime. If the comparison need be made, then yes, Rush 2049 is the better stunt racer all around. But don't overlook this little gem in the process -- it does a few things right and will be one of the better rental-only titles you're sure to see in the near future.", "date": "Oct 5, 2000"}
