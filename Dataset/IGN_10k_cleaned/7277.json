In fact, as you'll no doubt recall, one of the machine's very first titles was ESPN Extreme Games, developed by then Sony Interactive Studios America. Nearly four years later, Electronic Arts has delivered its first multi-event extreme sports offering: Rushdown. And though the potential of what EA could have done with such a title was certainly exciting, it ended up complete unlike a title you'd expect from one of the industry's largest and most respected publishing houses. In short: It's a stinker.  Developed by France's Canal+ Multimedia, Rushdown features three extreme sporting events: Snowboarding, kayaking, and mountain biking. Players have four characters to choose from (all of which have identical skills, unfortunately) and several types of snowboards, kayaks, and bikes. The racing itself takes place on world-wide courses, ranging in location from Africa to the United States. Doesn't sound too bad in concept, does it? But then you actually play it.  Rushdown delivers what is perhaps one of the least enthralling gameplay experiences we've ever had on our PlayStations  it's simply the farthest thing from what we had expected from EA this far into the system's life span. Visually, the game offers little to differentiate it from first-generation titles, and it only goes downhill (pardon the pun) from there. The snowboarding events pit you against one opponent and offer no capacity for executing tricks; just steer and jump. The kayaking segments consist of piloting your boat down a river that you never feel (or look like) you're actually in. And the mountain biking is nothing more than an ~avoid the obstacle~ contest. Compounding matters further is the fact that hitting obstacles in any of the events causes your character to fall down several feet after the collision. Realism is definitely not this game's forte.  Just for comparison's sake, we popped in a copy of SISA's aforementioned ESPN Extreme Games, a game released back in 1995 and consisting entirely of bitmap graphics, and soon found myself playing a game that looked better, controlled better, and was certainly more fun. Not that it's a good game, mind you, but it serves to illustrate the simple truth that a first-generation game could out-do EA's current effort. Not good.  These massive shortcomings, combined with lackluster sound (the effects are horribly raspy, the music repetitive), and barely passable design result in a game of the lowest order that won't even please the most seriously devoted extreme sports lover.", "date": "Mar 10, 1999"}
