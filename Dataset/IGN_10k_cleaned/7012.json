No real reason, actually. But if you find yourself reading this review, you probably find it funny. Chances are you know a parent looking for a kid-friendly videogame; maybe you're a parent yourself. Either way, there's a good chance you have this little jingle memorized because you've seen Franklin on Noggin like a thousand times.   As a videogame, Franklin: A Birthday Surprise caters to the same audience as the show. It offers non-violent entertainment while trying to teach cultural niceties like teamwork and friendship. So basically, it's like most kid games that don't have rocket launchers or expendable prostitutes in them. What makes Franklin a little different, however, is that it's not insulting to adults. Parents won't mind playing this one with their kids.    The game splits into two different modes, Adventure and Recreation. The first, and biggest, is Adventure. Here, you help Franklin prepare for a birthday party by performing a number of different simple attacks. The first level has you collecting different types of fruit so you can make fruit salad, for instance, while another has you picking up decorations for the party. Whether delivering invitations or making a present, most of the game's objectives have you scour the town for items.   Adventure mode plays like a 2.5 sidescroller. Certain objects have been rendered in 3D, but you can only move characters on a 2D plane. Those who don't know much about videogames need know only one thing: it plays somewhat like a super simplified Super Mario Bros. game. This means you will spend most of your time jumping on platforms, collecting items and avoiding environmental dangers. But don't worry, by dangerous, understand the most quasi-lethal thing here are bees. You just have to make sure Franklin avoids them.    The game's target audience demands gameplay be kept simple. You won't find any fancy acrobatics here. You can hop from platform to platform, crawl through small spaces and move boxes. It may not sound like much, but developers have made good use of each move. Young players will have to solve puzzles and make their way through several different stages collecting hidden items. It's all absurdly easy for veteran gamers, but they'll never play this game, anyway. It's made for kids.  In addition to the main Adventure mode, there's a compilation of mini-games, known as the Recreation mode. You can expect 15 of them, which is a pretty good number in any case; kid's game or otherwise. Each is pretty fun, too, though they're simple just like everything else in the game. Your little gamer can enjoy sailboat and scooter races, hide and seek, and even word games. Some of these actually show up in the middle of Adventure mode, and you need to beat them to proceed, but here you can try them in any order you like.   Franklin: A Birthday Surprise offers a good deal of variety for younger gamers. Adventure mode is long enough to satiate the needs of bigger kids, while the simplicity of Recreation mode should appeal to smaller players. Throw in decent graphics and a pretty good score, and youve got a surprisingly decent game for the youngins.", "date": "Jun 20, 2006"}
