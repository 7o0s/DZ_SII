Essentially, it's Pong, but with a slightly more complicated set of rules. However, after the serve, the game pretty much settles into the back, forth, back, forth rhythm of the classic video game granddaddy, and that's when my interest starts to wane. Unless, of course, there's some sort of hook to hang it all on. Nintendo's Mario Tennis, for example, has that huge stable of mascots and their whimsical behaviors. I-play, when it licensed the likeness to the very comely Maria Sharapova, went for a more realistic route. And the problem with being realistic mobile tennis is that after a few minutes, it settles into back, forth, back, forth.Mario Sharapova Tennis isn't a bad tennis sim for cells -- not in the least. It's twin modes, quick game and career tour, let both casual players and big-time tennis fans choose how deep they wanna get into the game. Quick game just spawns a court and gets the action started, while the tour places you at the beginning of a tournament where you must play your way to the finals. And it's not entirely out of the question to not see the actual finals every time you enter the tournament -- it sounds cruel, but it's nothing if not realistic.The success of tennis games hinge almost entirely on control. Mario Sharapova Tennis is somewhat hobbled in this manner, because even with the ability to choose shots, ball control is very limited. Normally, you would expect to be able to put a spin on shots and try to bounce them into the corners of the court. Unfortunately, you don't have that level of functionality in Mario Sharapova Tennis -- it's just back, forth, back, forth and the game suffers for it.Mario Sharapova Tennis is not without reward: Players that stick with the career mode will earn bank. The more libidinous will probably prefer the images of Sharapova that are earned with success. At least I-play knows its audience here.The game looks pretty decent. The player models are fairly small, but they do occupy a nice-sized court that is dressed up with good color and texture. Line umpires watch the ball in the distance. There are three types of courts to play on, too, such as grass and clay.Mario Sharapova Tennis is a missed opportunity, but I'm not sure how much I-play could have done with it anyway. This is certainly one of the better tennis games out there, but that's not exactly saying much -- as the last couple I have played were real stinkers. I wanted a little more control over the ball so that the game didn't degenerate into Pong as quickly as it did. If you tingle for Maria, maybe this is a decent download. But if you're a fan of tennis, put down the phone and just watch it on television.", "date": "Sep 13, 2005"}
