{"name": "Dragon Riders -- Chronicles of Pern", "name_review": "Dragon Riders - Chronicles of Pern", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/01/dragon-riders-chronicles-of-pern", "text": "Based on the popular series by famed sci-fi author, Anne McCaffrey, Dragon Riders - Chronicles of Pern offers up a world inhabited by futuristic, yet technologically backwards dragon-riding people in a continuing struggle against a parasitic and terribly destructive space-faring entity known as the Thread. You'd think a premise as rich as this would be a cool thing for a videogame... You'd think.  Thousands of years into the future mankind will inhabit many other worlds, Pern being one of them. Too bad for Pern's new inhabitants, it seems about every two-hundred years the planet is ravaged by a menacing alien life form native to a passing red star. For thousands of years the colonists have tried to find ways to combat this jerk alien -- only through breeding local lizards into controllable dragons have they found a proper defense. You take on the role of D'Kor, one of a group of famed and respected soldiers known as dragon riders, who fight off the Thread from the back of psychically bonded dragons.  Now there's also this Weyrwoman who rides on a golden dragon and is somehow in charge of everyone else. But she's dead, so you have to find a new Weyrwoman to bond with this new hatching gold dragon. Unfortunately, the significance of all of this is rarely touched upon within the game, something, that if remedied, could have been a notch in the sadly empty 'pro' list of this overwhelmingly 'con' title. There's also a bunch of other story elements that'll come into play throughout the span of Dragon Riders, but hey...who cares, right? Your name is D'Kor and you walk around doing lame stuff that you wouldn't even want to do in real life, none of which ever includes controlling your stupid dragon.  Despite some highlights, the graphics are strangely and sadly reminiscent of the first Tomb Raider. Compared to today's standards set by even lesser games, Pern falls substantially short with its uninspired environments, uninspired characters, and rather lacking animation. Saving graces when speaking of aesthetics come in the form of average to above average facial animation and articulation (as far as these games go). I found them to be comparable to the heads in Red Faction, for those who'll know. And for those who won't, that means their mouths, lips, and eyebrows all move in coordination, and they even have teeth. The rest of their bodies are a different story, however, and animate as stiff as anything else out there.  Aurally, Dragon Riders is passable, even enjoyable at times. While the sound effects are nothing revolutionary, the speech is passable, and the music is quite pleasant. Comprised of a collection of appropriate period-based themes, the game's tunes are of the fantasy, lute variety. They're appropriate alright, and I should know, as I'm the master on distant future human colonized devolved planets where they play the lute and use big dragons to fight off parasites. Anyhoo, the Ultima lute music and atmospheric beats and growls are all solid.   Not an action RPG as most would believe, Dragon Riders - Chronicles of Pern, is instead an un-action RPG. It seems being a cool dragon-riding soldier isn't all it's cracked up to be. Apparently all you do is wander around, shop for groceries, perform tedious, menial tasks, and find toys for children, with the occasional lame-ass fight thrown in to spice things up a bit. Life in the fast lane is right. If the throbbing headache the game gives you in the first hour of play isn't enough to warrant the immediate destruction of the CD on which it came and subsequent purging of all related data from your hard drive, then the tiresome hours of conversational, plodding gameplay to follow certainly will be.   It controls like Resident Evil only everything done via prompts. So, you basically walk around until you are prompted to perform some action (initiate conversation, fight, use, etc.) and then you hit one of the two action buttons to cause some effect. Combat is also on a prompt only basis. When an enemy is within range, a prompt will appear and you can then hold down the spacebar button and depress the forward arrow key in either short or long spouts for weak or strong attacks accordingly. Blocking and strafing are also possible in combat mode via the down and left/right arrow keys respectively. Combat sucks... Stupid Dragon. You can get through pretty much all of the game's fighting by holding down spacebar and pressing the up arrow key a billion times. Which is super fun since the game is pretty unresponsive in this department and combat is where the most underdeveloped of animations reside.  It's all good as long as the exploration is cool, right? Right! But alas, I wouldn't exactly use the word ~cool~ to describe Pern's exploration. The camera system is so atrocious and debilitating that whatever shred of joy gamers, and die-hard fans of the fiction alike could have found in the title gets blown so far out the door it hits some poor bastard ordering a double-froth latte at Starbucks across the street. It's like a terrible, terrible take desecration of the system effectively employed in Resident Evil: Code Veronica. The camera is at times both static and roaming, and affords the player absolutely zero control, something you'll grow to hate in about four seconds of play.  As if the wild swings, awkward placement, and twitchy positioning weren't bad enough, Pern also has the innate ability to get your character caught outside the realm of viewable screen. In fact, it gets so bad at times, that you'll completely lose track of your character and the only way of getting him back into a playable area is by stooping to the ridiculous task of holding down a directional key in the hopes that he'll come into view entirely by chance. If he doesn't (which he won't) you'll then have to turn in small increments and repeat holding down the directional arrow until he eventually hits the proper trajectory to get out of wherever the heck he is. I lost literally five to ten minutes of my miserable life I'd have better spent getting mauled by a disgruntled horse on just this exact type of thing. I think I'm griping a little too much, because at least these unacceptable camera problems where I was actually completely incapable of control my player, afforded me respite from the tedium and aggravation of the rest of the game. I would have actually sold it as one of the game's features. ~New and improved puzzles keep you occupied for a long time!!!~   ~None of this matters infidel! So long as I can ride me my dragons all will be well,~ I hear you say...  Ah, my sad, sad friend... If you've still retained hope for this title then you're even more hopeless than I. You don't ever get to control your dragon. When you want to travel from one location to another you open up a menu, select, ~I want to leave,~ and choose your destination on a map. The rest is all in-game cutscene. I think this is awesome, because the way dragon flight is so flagrantly flaunted on the box you'd think you'd get to control the bleeding thing. But why is it awesome? Because it's like a total surprise when you get the game home! You're like, ~Dragon Riders, sweet!~ Then you play and are all like, ~Crap.~  The RPG aspect comes in the form of character development (you gain experience that's automatically allocated across various attributes, but I God knows I don't care about that, and neither will you) and the many, many conversations found throughout, none of which are skippable. Oh, how I hates me some non-skippable conversations. I must have spent two hours alone just sitting through dialog I accidentally got myself into by hitting the stupid action button at the wrong time. While, as mentioned, the acting is passable, some of the dialog can range from boring to mind-rattlingly dumb, ~Dragonriders are only reasons their houses aren't razed and their flesh seared from their bones.~ At which point our lad replies, ~And they should be grateful?~ Um... Of course they shouldn't! Who would be grateful for being protected from a little house razing and flesh searing? Not me. To hell with that. I ain't showing nobody no gratefulness whatsoever.   I also find some of the other interactions to be a bit confusing. Take this one for example, which I still can't quite understand the relevance of...      Our hero D'Kor is now afforded a choice. Should he let the pretentious girl touch his beloved dragon? For all he knows she could hurt him, or get him sick. Still, he's kind and always willing to let girls get their hands on his dragon, so he goes along with it... For the time being.      Excellent! The dragon likes the girl very much and the two seem to be getting along well! As you can see all fears and apprehensions our hero may have had have long since faded. The dragon is very accepting of the girl and the two seem to be getting along swimmingly!       No, no no. It appears she's been touching it for far too long. The dragon cannot maintain this level of prodding for much longer and the effects of the girl's prying are starting to show on D'Kor.      Now that the girl is finished, D'Kor, master of oiling dragon hide, is generally glad she took such pleasure in touching his dragon. He's not so sure about the whole mom thing though but I suppose if she also wanted to touch his dragon he would allow it, being the considerate bloke he is. Provided she were also clean and gentle, he shouldn't have much of a problem. But then, would not every person in town want to also touch his dragon? One would suspect that after so much touching the dragon would become agitated and sore.      Finished with their interaction, the girl leaves D'Kor with only a handful of slightly sticky sweets to remember her by.  See, I'm just not so sure I fully understand the point of all of that.   I suppose if the game weren't so boring, so visually unpleasing, so tedious, so poorly controlled, and if it pretty much wasn't Dragonriders Chronicles of Pern then it could be okay. Too bad, as is, one of those lazy dragons needs to turn its fat ass around and blow some fire directly at the game from which it came, as a little smoldering action is the only salvation I can fathom for this beast. Steer clear, far clear. Even if you just like to buy games with the sole intention of sticking them in your microwave just to see what happens there are certainly cheaper things out there, and most won't even require you to cleanse any dragon ass. Sure, the game might have been good had it been released in 1994...and not been so awful.", "date": "Oct 1, 2001"}
