{"name": "Aly and AJ", "name_review": "The Aly & AJ Adventure Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/29/the-aly-aj-adventure-review", "text": "When teen pop stars Aly & AJ were asked about their thoughts on evolution, Aly answered the question with a question, ~Are they teaching that in schools now?~ (Yes, for a couple of decades.) AJ made her position clear, ~Evolution is silly. Monkeys? Um, no.~ (Eloquently put.) So let's just say we're not dealing with MENSA candidates here. It makes sense, then, that The Aly & AJ Adventure is a minigame collection that puts the player in the role of the girls' assistant, helping the girls out as they helplessly bumble their way from concert to concert.    As the new assistant for Aly & AJ, the player follows the lovely blondes to four cities - Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, and London - and helps take care of the ~necessities.~ Tasks like cleaning graffiti off posters and helping with rehearsals are fairly standard. But then the player has to also help the sisters match basic objects and try to recognize their own photographs. They're pretty much lost without me.   I feel as helpless as they do when I'm trying to figure out which one is Aly and which one is AJ. It's really important too, because only one of them is of legal age. Maybe it would have helped if the game didn't have such horrible art design that turns two hot, home-schooled Christian girls into reject Bratz dolls. And since the artist managed to make the girls too generic to tell apart (which is actually accurate of their real selves) then the least they could have done was label them. I want to know which idiot is asking me to help her complete mindless tasks.   The minigames are usually pretty basic, but to actually beat them requires getting an A ranking. None of them are hard at all, but they also don't have a lot of instruction. They just kind of dump the player into the game without explaining controls, though they are usually something along to the line of ~tap that thing with the stylus.~ So kids that are playing might have to try a few times since the first time is spent wondering what's even going on here.   If you fail the girls, they'll send your sorry butt packing. By beating the minigames in each city, players unlock the concert venue where Aly & AJ perform one of their songs in a rhythm game. The developers took a concept that Elite Beat Agents made popular, and butchered it. Taping the geometric shapes as they fill in is far less intuitive than the closing rings. Plus, the taps don't even seem to be based on the music at all. Both Happy Feet and The Cheetah Girls managed to produce far more engaging knockoffs of the EBA design, and those games actually have better music.   The problem with the music in this game isn't that the songs suck. Don't get me wrong, they suck, but at least the girls write their own stuff and play instruments. The main issue is that there aren't even full songs, only about minute long clips. Go play one of those lame website banner ad games while listening to samples on iTunes and you pretty much have the entire experience of The Aly & AJ Adventure.   In addition to being mindless, boring, and repetitive, the game is only about four hours long. And since the minigames repeat themselves, the entire gaming experience is played within the first hour. The only reason to keep going is to unlock songs that can be played in the extras menu, but, like I said, they're about a minute long, so what's the point?If I had a hit single on the Billboard Top 20, I'd be pretty pissed if my video game tie in turned out like The Aly & AJ Adventure. It's clearly a budget made cash in that's trying to sucker some parents into buying it for their kids this Christmas. The game is not rewarding in the least, and offers no motivation to play the uninspired minigames. Plus it's over in a few hours. I never thought that a game about me traveling across the world, alone with two hot singers, could suck, but Aly & AJ proved to be about as engaging as listening to them talk about evolution.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
