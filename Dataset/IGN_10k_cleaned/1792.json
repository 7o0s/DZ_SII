From now on, with rare exception, I'm going to cap off the amount of time I spend writing a review for a game by the amount of time it took me to pass the game.  So, let's say it took me 40 hours to pass Shenmue II.  I will then be forced to finish writing a review of the game in less than 40 hours.  Things get a bit tricky when you have a really short game, as while writing a review in less than forty hours ain't too tricky, the same can't be said of a game that takes all of fifteen minutes to get through from start to finish.  Alas, as the first test of this new review policy, I'm forced to write about Capcom and Takumi's short-lived Gigawing 2.  Set your timers to fifteen, boys.  But first, let me explain why this review has been delayed for so long.  I picked up my import copy of Gigawing 2 nearly two weeks ago, and as with most titles, I began to sample the game on my VGA monitor before recording footage for screens and videos and what-not.  Usually, I sample a game for ten or fifteen minutes so that I can write something with at least moderate detail for first impressions.  Gigawing 2 managed to surprise me in that in those few minutes, I actually finished the game - that is, I saw the ending credits.  As a result, I totally forgot of the game's existence after having written the impressions, and it wasn't until yesterday that I had a few friends over and I realized that I had this two-week-old, four player simultaneous shooter featuring high-res graphics, orchestral music and some intense shooting action.  And with that realization, Gigawing 2 was brought back to life in multi-player form.  Fifteen minutes later, we'd passed it.  I think many who pick up Gigawing 2 will have a similar experience [the fifteen minutes have begun, by the way].  The one player mode is ever so short, capping off at only four normal vertically scrolling stages followed by three successive boss encounters.  Get rid of those boss encounters at the end, which actually manage to be a bit tedious, and you have, really, ten minutes of scrolling shooting.  You may feel a bit short changed.   There are a few things to extend the life of the game.  Capcom has included four selectable characters, each with their own story-line, complete with Japanese voice-overs and still animation pics, and ship.  The characters differ enough in weapon form, speed and bomb form so that you gain a somewhat new experience replaying the game multiple times.  Each character plays the game in a different order, meaning you'll see different levels under more difficult conditions, and if you like, you can play each level in score attack form once you've accessed the level.  You can also play the game over eight difficulty settings, the first level being a complete walkthough and the eighth level approaching Mars Matrix tough.  Don't expect too many rewards for playing the game over and over again, though - a few pieces of artwork in the game's gallery mode seem to be about it.   As mentioned, if you have a bunch of friends over, you can take part in what, if memory serves me correctly (although I'm certain someone will correct me) is the first four player simultaneous shooting game ever in the home.  You can actually play this mode with one, two or three friends total, all contributing to the same score.  There isn't too much difference from single player mode - no extra levels or team-up attacks of any form.  Unfortunately, this mode features far too much slowdown, on top of the already abundant slowdown in the game's single player mode.   Either through single player mode or multi-player mode, the game is far too short, perhaps even shorter than its predecessor.  The problem, in addition to the lack of normal levels, seems to be in the infinite continues.  You can keep on dieing over and over and over, and keep on continuing over and over and over.  Sure, if you're disciplined enough, you could forbid yourself from continuing, but I wish Capcom had given you the option of turning off the infinite continues in the options menu (even better would've been a Mars Matrix-style system in which you had to earn extra continues).  You can also adjust the number of ships and bombs in the options menu.  With nine lives and five bombs per life, you can probably breeze through the game's default difficulty setting with little interruption for entering your initials and selecting to continue.  I'd also question the general gameplay of Gigawing 2.  It all seems so basic and features the same problems of the original.  You shoot things, you collect occasional weapon upgrades and bombs, repeat over and over.  The game makes use of a reflect force or reflect laser system (you now have the option for two different versions) which sucks in enemy bullets, making you briefly invulnerable, then spits out the bullets back at the enemies (or blasts lasers at the enemies in the case of the laser version).  If you time your reflections correctly, you can make the screen fill with slow-down inducing money items.  Timing the reflection can be tough, though, as the reflect meter has to charge up for about a second or two before it activates.  In general, I found the timing of the charging to be too lengthy to use this for defensive purposes, as the time from when a bullet appears on screen to when it strikes your ship is usually shorter than the charge time.  There's a word for this when the screen is full of bullets: CHEAP.   Additionally, like its predecessor, the game has a serious flaw when it comes to bombs (this is a problem that many other shooters have as well).  Whenever you die, your bombs are replenished.  So, let's say you have three bombs remaining when you die.  You'll come back to life with a full stock of bombs.  Same goes for if you have one bomb remaining, no bombs remaining - whatever.  This poses a big problem because the game encourages you to make sure that you've used all your bombs before dieing - otherwise, you'll have wasted a bunch of fire-power.  For me, I couldn't get past a string of bomb-bomb-bomb-die-bomb-bomb-bomb-die repetition in the last level.  Using the bombs strategically is not particularly encouraged.  Games like Mars Matrix and Radiant Silvergun solve this problem by doing away with the bomb item all-together.  It's hard to go back... although, given the short length of the game and the infinite continues, the problem is mainly academic. Takumi has improved upon their shooting formula in just one area - presentation.  Unlike the original Gigawing and Mars Matrix, Gigawing 2 was designed from the ground-up to run on Sega's Naomi arcade board.  This results in high-res, sixty frames-per second polygon graphics for all ships and most of the backgrounds.  Of course, this means backgrounds warping in and out all over the place, and while the game remains vertically scrolling throughout, there are some awe-inspiring transition sequences (the opening of the air-ship stage, where your fighter descends upon the tops of a fleet of ships MUST be seen).  The power-ups and fire-power seem to be a mix of polygons and sprites, and there are a whole lot of these on screen, resulting in a whole lot of slowdown, especially when you make use of the reflection system and when you play the four player mode.  The slowdown doesn't actually get in the way too much, though, and it sometimes results in a cool effect.  The game's sound has also been revamped over previous Takumi titles.  The music is fully orchestrated, in stark contrast to the generic arcade-generated techno from Mars Matrix.  It's not choreographed to the level like you'd find in a few of the classic Turbo Duo shooters, but there are some inspiring moments.  Overall, this isn't a Lords of Thunder or Axelay as far as artistic values are concerned, but Takumi's move to more advanced hardware has clearly let its creative force show their stuff.  We can hope that next time the creative force can add a few more levels, options and some better gameplay ideas so that the game will warrant a much longer review.  -- Anoop Gantayat, Contributor", "date": "Feb 16, 2001"}
