OK, that's silly. All supa nasty rhymes aside, Codemasters has indeed brought a new, updated version to the PlayStation 2: in some ways it's absolutely annoying, and in other ways it's improved. I'm excited to have made a few good songs, but not necessarily pleased with the way in which I had to make them.  MTV Music Generator 2 is revamped with a fresh new interface and menu system, and it's draped with two new flashy extras, Funkmaster Flex's endorsement, and if you have the cash and the wherewithal, a Sampler Kit to bring in your own voice, music, or homemade riffs. Overall, it's a great program to make songs with, plush with more riffs than the first game, and more genres of music, too. But if you have played the first one, you'll have to relearn everything from scratch.   Gameplay MTV Music Generator 2 is a program rather than a game. It follows up from the first game on PlayStation that enables players to sort through riff libraries, select the right ones, and paste them together in a nice, occasionally original composition. MTV Music Generator 2 provides more music samples than the first game, more genres of music, and delivers a different layout in which to compose them. Along with the core of the game, which is making the songs themselves, players also can make movies that accompany the music, and can hook up with three friends to ~jam~ in a four-player session. For those who have the cash, a Sampler Kit can be attained to input your own voice, sounds, and music of your choice. It's probably the best new addition to the game, if you want to spend the extra cash.   Codemasters apparently wanted to re-create the game, but not exactly like the first. For somebody who thought he knew how to make music in this series of games, I was simply pissed off at the changes. I swore, I yelled, I was ready to quit. Everything I knew about the first had essentially been changed. Music is selected in a different way; the songs read down the song palette rather than across; there are tons of little extra things that don't make sense, or are simply beyond the standard gamer, like BPM and even song effects, because they take so long to figure and then to implement; and you simply cannot make a single song without first reading the manual. I tell you, I would have returned it if I didn't have a lot of patience. The menu system, in case it isn't obvious, is not intuitive or easily useable, and that's putting it nicely.   Then, of course, with much despair and truly disgruntled, I read the manual, just waiting to read one slip up so that I could slam the game (because by then I was in a stink). Even after reading the basics I couldn't get it right. So, I read the Tutorials, word by word, step by step, painstakingly, begrudgingly, until finally I got it right. I made the song that was laid out in Tutorial 2. I tell you, I am not a Luddite, and I don't mind change, in fact, I'm fond of it. But the first game was fine! It did things well. It just needed more RAM and more riffs. Anyway back to my story. So, angry, I slept on it. The next day, I drove to work and started composing another song. This time, I knew the basics and could move around the menu fine. I recognized icons. I could demo the songs, select them, place them in my song palette, group them, copy and repeat them, etc.   When I finally made the song, I was sort of happy. Not thrilled like I was the first time I used the first PlayStation game, but mildly pleased. Then as I explored the game further, I realized how some of the changes improved the program. The game is much faster than before, thanks to the PS2's huge engine and its heavy dosage of RAM. You can now select samples and quickly use them in your palette. The vertical scrolling song palette is not bad, it's equally useable. The magnetized pointer is generally a good thing, sort of like the auto-aim in Red Faction -- occasionally annoying, but often very useful. The four music element icons -- rhythm, bass, melody and vocals -- are not entirely stupid (although only the vocals and the melody icons made graphic sense as icons). And so on, and so on. I also re-realized something: making just one song right takes a long time.   So, after my big-ass bitch-fest, I made some music. Then I made more and more, and I was OK. In the end, MTV Music Generator 2 is a better program because it's bigger, offers more than before, and in some ways is a more refined program, but in other ways, it's just too complicated for its own good. In my humble opinion Codemasters should have not redone everything, but instead bolstered the first format, which still required a menu system, but not the same degree that this one does. MTV Music Generator 2 functions, but many folks will simply drop this thing like a hot frying pan because of its lengthy, often difficult set of instructions. This game is not, by any means, even moderately accessible.   Aside from the core program, the other assets are interesting, but unfortunately even more targeted toward niches within niches of gamers. Changing things like BPM and editing riffs is cool (like they were in the first), but they're not as interesting as inputting your own music. With the Sampler, folks can really dig in and make unique music. It's truly needed for this program to live for more than a few days. There are two reasons: First, while there are more riffs in this game, pretty much all of the vocal riffs suck -- big time. I went through and sampled all of the Indy and rock vocal tracks and they are utterly useless, hurtful riffs that made me wince.   Second, and in part supported by the first, once you get the rhythm, bass and melody together, nothing really tells a story except vocals, and even if I liked the vocals selections, none actually work well enough together to create one song that A) makes sense, B) sounds decent or C) works with the song you have created. In short, the vocals are useless as vocals, and work decently at best substituting as rhythms.   Just a few other aspects make this thing run. The video maker falls in line with most of what I have said about the music making aspects of the game. It's awkward at first, and makes some sense after much manual reading. It does produce better-looking videos, though nothing unusual. The multiplayer aspect of the game is decent too, but once again, it's more of a demo, and good for late nights when you're brain is influenced by chemicals and three other friends are sitting around bored.   Graphics The graphics in MTV Music Generator 2 are essentially icons and squares. There isn't too much to talk about. The video section of the game produces better looking graphics than before, so there is a stronger benefit in creating them. Also the skins, which are essentially like dashboards, come in several flavors. They're all quite neat, but at least in my opinion, the best are the ones that take up the least amount of space, and are intuitive. And that's about 50% of them. Sci-fi, Post Apocalyptic, and Flashy hi-fi are the best, and although I personally like the others because they are funny and purposely old-fashioned, they're less useful.   Sound It's important to note that the best riff libraries are once again the same ones from the first game. The Pop section is best in some cases, and the Trance and and House are in others. It all comes down to creating songs, and I found that just like in the first title, the best songs created by this program comprise breakbeat, house, and trance. It's not much for Rock or Indy. If you buy this game, definitely, definitely buy the Sampler Kit!   As for the sound quality, almost of the samples are of high quality. They are sampled crisply and clearly. The voice tracks are pure sounding, without static or extra artifacts getting in the way, and all are edited perfectly.   While it might have seemed like a good idea at first (at least to Codemasters' marketing department, I suspect), the intro with DJ Funkmaster Flex is just lame. No offense Mr. Flex, but your sales pitch is wasted on those who already bought the game, and the 45-second load time it creates to see you scratching with a Dual Shock is not only worthless in content, it's stupid to think that anybody could ~mix~ with a Dual Shock. As with many games these days, I have mixed emotions about MTV Music Generator 2. The unintuitive menu system, which is essentially 80% of game, is frustrating, even after reading the instructions. This program is not for a little kids, or even most teenagers, and perhaps not even for game editors who liked the first Music Generator. It's for single males with unfulfilled dreams of making music, but can't play a chord on a piano, or can't sing tune, and who have phenomenal patience. Even for these people, the game is mostly satisfying, but equally frustrating. MTV Music Generator 2 is not an accessible game, but a highly placed niche game that will appeal to very few, very determined gamers who want to make music. To reach the next level with this game, it's an absolute must to buy the additional Music Sampler. Of course, I did not use this tool, but I know that it does enable you to sample your own music, voices, and riffs from any other CD. If it works as Codemasters says it does, then it should be a valuable tool. In short, MTV Music Generator 2 is a great idea. It's truly satisfying making a song and hearing it for the first time along with others who are usually turned on by the idea. There is no other game on the PS2 like this, and for what it is, Codemasters' game is a valuable, original game, even if it is frustrating, occasionally unintelligeble pain in the ass. You must really, truly, dearly want to make music -- and be good at reading pages of instructions and have lots of patience -- to buy this game.", "date": "Jun 11, 2001"}
