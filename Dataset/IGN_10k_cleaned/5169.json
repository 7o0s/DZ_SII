In March, Team Ninja introduced one of the greatest action games of all time in Ninja Gaiden. Now, as the year comes to a close, Team Ninja brings us the best fighting game on Xbox with Dead or Alive Ultimate. As with Ninja Gaiden and truly every Team Ninja game on the 'box, DOA Ultimate maximizes the hardware, creating an absolutely gorgeous visual experience. Not only is this game pretty, it is a whole lot of fun.  Let me be clear that DOAU should not be mistaken for DOA 4. This is not the next chapter or a follow-up to DOA 3, which was an Xbox launch title. Instead, DOAU is a two-disc set that offers the original Sega Saturn Dead or Alive and a remake of Dead or Alive 2. But this isn't some cheaply thrown together collection. The remade DOA 2, which is the true focus of this release, offers completely redesigned arenas (so different some may not be recognizable), a bevy of unlockable costumes (oh, Santa Kasumi, how I love you), and online play over Xbox Live. Though it is not DOA 4, it sure does feel like a whole new game and is easily worthy of a $50 purchase.  Fight Club Nothing is more important in a brawler than the fighting system. You can have the prettiest game in the world, but if the fighting sucks, the game becomes miserable to play. Fortunately, DOAU gives you the cake and lets you eat it too. While the fighting system is not as deep as some games, it's accessible to just about any gamer with a pair of opposable thumbs.  For the uninitiated, DOAU is a fast-paced 3D fighter with a focus on eccentric characters. Three things set the DOA series apart from other 3D fighters: The arenas, reversals, and cleavage.   16:9 Video Review As one of the first online 3D fighters, Dead or Alive Ultimate is easily one of the biggest releases of 2004. It's also one of the prettiest, which is why we've created this sweet, widescreen video review. It covers everything extensively, and even highlights many of the new costumes and stages. If you've got questions about DOA Ultimate, this has the answers.  Download It Now  Arenas: There are two types of arenas in DOAU: enclosed and multi-tiered. There are only a half-dozen enclosed arenas, which are primarily used for Tag Team matches, though one-on-one fights also work. The walls of enclosed arenas are often quite dangerous as seen with the Cyclotron and Dangerzone, which offer some explosive fireworks upon contact. Multi-tiered arenas are where it's really at, with players able to throw, kick, and even ride opponents to lower levels for devastating damage.   Reversals: Almost every attack can be reversed, meaning that with proper timing and the right button presses you can gain the advantage on an attacker. Reversals are very powerful, but do require precise timing. Reversal (or hold) moves offer the very best animations in DOAU.  Cleavage: Though only six of the fifteen available fighters are female, DOAU is intensely focused on its ladies. The women are better balanced, have far more costumes, and are, for video game characters, quite beautiful. With big, expressive eyes, these babes seem to have come right out of an anime and have that school girl innocence to them. Anyone who denies that the face of Dead or Alive is a set of hooters is foolin' themselves. Just accept it, DOAU is pre-occupied with hot babes, but then so am I, so that works out nicely.  Some other recent 3D fighters have tried to mirror the formula, but no one has mastered these three elements like DOAU. Though others may prefer the stiff animations and death traps of Mortal Kombat: Deception, I'll take the elegance and speed of DOAU any day of the week. It's like comparing a Saturn to a Mercedes. Sure, some will argue that a Saturn is a good investment, reliable, and offers friendlier service. Hell, I drive a Saturn to work every day, but given the choice, what intelligent individual wouldn't choose a 'cedes instead?   A Question of Depth DOAU's greatest asset is its accessibility. It's why so many hardcore fighting fans despise the game, because anyone can pick up DOA and play well after only a little bit of practice. But, as with even the simplest game, those who devote themselves to DOAU will easily be able to best a newbie.   There is depth here, it just isn't as intricate or technically demanding as Guilty Gear or Virtua Fighter. Each fighter has roughly 70 moves, including throws, reversals, and numerous combos. When I watch even the good players in the office fight, I see them using about 40% of the moves available. They are capable fighters, but they are also easy to reverse and playing them is, at times, like fighting in slow motion, because it's easy to anticipate just about every combo. That's because I'm the only one in the office who has played a significant amount of DOAU. Should someone come along who utilizes more moves and mixes it up better, I'd likely get my ass beat badly.      It's not that there are many complex moves to perform in DOAU. In fact, I would say that 95% of the moves can be done by just about anyone, no matter the skill level. It's just that most players don't use all of the moves available. So while, on the surface, they can look great fighting, it's difficult for a mediocre player to best anyone who knows DOAU inside and out.   I love DOAU and can accept its faults. It's not as good as Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution and certainly not as deep. However, those who think they can best a good player on a regular basis by mashing buttons hasn't played anyone who knows the game. DOAU rewards gamers who spend time learning every move and practicing, because anticipating your opponent's attack is the key to dominating a match and mixing up your own combos is the best way to avoid reversals and counters.  Reversals What makes DOAU easier for some is the inclusion of reversals. DOA 3 used a simplified three-point system, where you only had to worry about pressing back-up, back-down, or back-middle with the X button to reverse a move. It's pretty easy once you learn the timing. However, being a remake of DOA 2, Ultimate uses a four-point counter system. This system uses the same three-points as DOA 3 but adds a fourth counter-point, which requires gamers to press forward and X to reverse some moves. Generally these are middle kicks, but can be other moves as well and the only way to know these is to practice, practice, practice.   The reversal system is meant to force gamers to mix up their combos. If you keep attacking with middle punches or you cycle through the same three combos, your opponent can easily anticipate your attacks, reverse them, and take you down quickly. However, keep mixing it up and you will be able to avoid most reversals. Better still, when your opponent attempts a reversal and fails, they leave themselves wide open for a brief second. There is a balance, but reversals do too much damage this time out. If Team Ninja included a slider to reduce reversal damage to fit your own preference, there would be no problem, but you have to accept the almost prohibitive amount of damage done by some reversals.  Reversals aren't as easy to pull off as in DOA 3, but unfortunately they are a lot more powerful. The damage done can sometimes cut your health by a third or even by half. If Team Ninja made one mistake in all of DOAU it's the power of reversals. I love having them in the game, but they do too much damage.   Arenas DOA Ultimate's biggest improvement is the arenas. The 22 available fighting stages have been assembled from all three Dead or Alive games, but each has been redesigned. While a few look similar to what we've seen before (Danger Zone, Aquarium), many more are almost unrecognizable thanks to some brilliant revisions.  Where in the old days, you usually had one or possibly two ~edges~ in an arena where you could knock a player to a lower level, you now have up to a half-dozen, depending on the arena. This means a lot more variety in fights and a lot more little secret places to stumble across. Slopes have also been added as a new means of dropping to a lower tier. This introduces slope moves, which is a special throw that drops your opponent down one tier. Some are complex and awesome in motion (Tina riding Bass down a snow hill like a sled is priceless) and others are a bit more basic and a tad less spectacular (Kasumi offers a single, powerful punch to drop her opponent). Slope moves are a nice, small addition that don't have much impact on gameplay, but offer something new to watch that hasn't been seen in previous Dead or Alive games.    Just like reversals, though, drops to a lower tier cause way too much damage. While it's awesome to see Zack rolling down the steps of the Great Wall for 20 seconds, it's not so great that he loses a huge chunk of health in the process. Again, sliders or better tuning would solve this problem. As is, the main strategy becomes knocking your opponent to a lower level, because it's the fastest path to victory.  There are a lot of nice touches in the arenas that overcome some of the balancing issues. Arenas are bustling with activity and life, with bunnies running past fighters, perched vulture observing battles, elephants stomping their discontent and meandering hippos chilling in the water. What's amazing is that none of it seems to detract from the fighting, it just adds a greater sense of vitality to each area.    Characters DOA Ultimate has 15 playable characters, 14 of which come straight from Dead or Alive 2. The extra character is Hitomi, who first appeared in DOA 3. Sadly, there's no sign or even hope for Brad Wong or Christie from DOA 3, unless they are incredibly well-hidden. Since I played DOAU for 60 hours, besting it every which way to Sunday, I highly doubt they are in the game. Maybe if you play it for 2000 hours they magically appear? Yeah, go for it!  For those curious, here's the full list of playable characters:Kasumi Gen Fu Tina Zack Jann Lee Ayane Hayabusa Helena Bass Leon Lei Fang Ein Bayman Hitomi Tengu Each character starts with only two costumes, but there are plenty more to unlock. While Team Ninja won't give us the full skinny on the total number of costumes, to date I have unlocked 169 total outfits, and there may be more. That is damn crazy. The girls, of course, have far more costumes than the boys.  Overall there is a good balance between characters. The ladies are almost perfectly balanced between speed and power. Take any two ladies into a match and go at it and the better gamer will usually win. Bass, Leon, and Bayman are strong and do a lot of damage, but they are also slow and much easier to block and counter. Hayabusa and Ein are much like the women, strong but not over-powering. There are two characters, however, who are totally out of whack. Zack and his over-powerful kicks and Jann Lee's ridiculous ~Watah!~ attacks that are far too easy to pull off and way too devastating.    Jann Lee is the worst of all, because his attacks do massive damage and knock the other character halfway across the screen. Do the double-elbow back attack and you not only score a major hit, but you can easily knock an opponent off the edge, causing even greater damage. The good news is, Jann Lee's attacks are among the easiest to defend, but he's certainly an off-kilter combatant.   Modes DOAU's big mode is online, but there are some other modes that shouldn't be ignored. These modes (Story, Time Attack, Survival, Tag Battle, Team Battle, Versus, Sparring, and Watch) have all appeared previously in DOA and offer nothing particularly new other than the ability to upload your winning time/score online so that you can compare yourself to others around the world.   Many of these modes offer the ability to play single-player or tag team. A tag team match means two-on-two, but that doesn't mean you have four players in the ring at the same time. Instead, it's two characters battling it out, with the ability to ~tag out~ and switch with the character waiting outside the ring. There are combo throws that utilize your ally, but otherwise, DOAU keeps it a one-on-one brawler.     Of these modes, I was surprised that I actually went back to the Story Mode over and over. Mainly this is because it's the fastest way to unlock costumes, but I must say that this is a much less frustrating Story Mode than seen in DOA 3 (which had a horrendous boss battle). A seven stage battle ending in a fight with Tengu, Story Mode is short and it's only real failing is that it lacks the gorgeous CG endings seen in the last Dead or Alive title. However, Tengu's stage and the way it changes during battle is impressive. It's actually worthwhile to play through the Story Mode multiple times, which isn't something you can say about most fighters.    Online Originally titled Dead or Alive Online, DOA Ultimate is the second 3D fighter to hit Xbox Live. While there have been some 2D online fighters (with Guilty Gear X2 by far the best), no online fighting game has offered as much as Ultimate. The beauty of this game has not been altered at all for online, so you can enjoy the complete visual experience while battling someone on the other side of the country.   DOA Ultimate introduces the idea of a Virtual Arcade. Each online game creates a lobby where up to eight people can join from around the world. Though you can have battles with up to four people (two-on-two tag team), the rest of the crowd watches in spectator mode, with full camera control and the ability to talk to one another. As matches end, new players in the arcade cycle in and fight, depending on the game mode. This nullifies the one-on-one mentality of other online fighters, where you are stuck fighting one person in any mode unless you want to create a new game and find someone else to fight against.  The Virtual Arcade really does work like an arcade and features six different fighting modes: Winner-Stays, Loser-Stays, Kumite, Survival, Tournament, and Team Battle. Since I've previously covered these modes in greater depth, I will say that Winner-Stays is easily the best mode, though each mode has its positives. Okay, I still don't get Loser-Stays, where the loser of a match continues to fight, but I suppose it could serve as a good training tool for inexperienced players.   While a bunch of nifty modes is a definite plus, no fighting game is worth a cent if it's laggy online. Until today, I had never experienced any lag while playing against others in my region. However, this afternoon I did hit some laggy games, which means that DOAU may not offer as smooth an experience as originally expected. It's tough to say whether this will be a problem or not, since it's the first time I've run into any slowdown while playing online. The good news is that the lag was minimal and didn't hinder me from getting my ass kicked.    The numerous modes, relatively smooth online play, and great ranking system (which includes lists of the most popular online characters) easily make this the best online fighter on any console. Though DOAU has plenty to please you offline, it's the online play that will provide the longevity.   DOA 1 Remember way back at the start of this review when I mentioned DOA Ultimate is a two-disc set? DOA 2 Ultimate is actually the second disc and the one you will keep in your Xbox 95% of the time. The first disc is Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate, which ports the first DOA from the Sega Saturn. This is relatively untouched, though it seems the models are a little smoother (or perhaps I'm crazy), the framerate sped up and smoothed out, and the game now playing in 640 x 480 resolution, so that it actually looks pretty good on a TV. Though there is no widescreen support for DOA 1, it's still a nice looking flashback to the early '90s.    While you may not want to play much of the first DOA, it is interesting to check it out for a bit. A lot of the moves here have carried over through the next two games. If you are at all curious about the origins of the series, now that curiosity can be answer. And it's playable online. Reversals are there, but less powerful and instead of complex arenas, you battle on explosive disco floors. Worth a try and it's cool to have, but not a significant part of the package unless you are a diehard DOA fan.  True Beauty Good Lord, Team Ninja knows how to make pretty games. What can be said about the graphics that you can't see instantly in a screenshot or video? Those aren't touch-up jobs -- every screen you see is actual gameplay. That's how amazing this game looks. Using a different engine than DOA 3, Ultimate pushes the boundaries of what Xbox can do. With 480p widescreen support (on- and offline), and running at a truly consistent 60 frames per second, DOAU is the most technically proficient game on Xbox. I doubt we'll see a better-looking fighting game this generation.      It's not just the smooth animations, vivacious girls, and detailed environments that get the job done as each stage appears specifically designed to push the Xbox hardware further. Throwing in a few hundred floating cherry blossom leaves amidst a hectic fight or adding a snowstorm to a battle must be no biggie to Team Ninja. How much better does it look? The Aquarium, which in DOA 3 was the most incredible sight at Xbox launch, is now one of the less-impressive stages. Damn does DOA Ultimate look fine.  The technical excellence carries through with the audio, which utilizes 5.1 Dolby Digital. While it may seem that sound isn't as big a deal in a fighting game, Team Ninja took care to make sure that the sounds matched each environment. Those with 5.1 will know when they are indoors or when it is windy or when there is a thunderstorm. If you only have stereo, you will miss out on a lot of the environmental effects, including some muting for certain indoor areas (yes, they simulate a change in acoustics). If you're doing the old school stereo sound option all you have is the music to enjoy... Or, not enjoy.  The music playing during the menus and in-game is the same we've been hearing since DOA 2 and it's really getting old. With no custom soundtrack support, there is no way to avoid listening to the overused techno garble that was once acceptable but has begun to wear on me. It's not bad, I'm just sick of having to listen to it after all these years.  Voices are solid though and you can choose between DOA 2 and DOA 3 voice actors. There's also an option to alter the announcers voice, including the ability to use some of the lady fighters, who speak in almost broken English to announce the start of each round.    Dead or Alive Ultimate is indeed the Ultimate fighter on Xbox -- there is none better. The online set-up goes well beyond what has been previously done for fighting games and betters some online first-person shooters to boot. Team Ninja is master of maximizing the hardware and the fact that DOAU can look this good and run so well online is a testament to Team Ninja's dedication to Xbox. Few console games can compete visually and the amount of content in terms of unlockable costumes far exceeds what is seen from today's fighters. Sure, there's no concept art or storyboards to unlock, but I'd rather have 20 costumes for Kasumi over some artwork.Not everyone in the world is a Dead or Alive fan. A lot of hardcore fight fans bemoan the fact that this is not Virtua Fighter. No, it's not. But guess what? There is no Virtua Fighter on Xbox. DOAU makes up for any lack of depth with addictive, fast, and fantastic fighting that takes place in some jaw-dropping locales with characters that fill up the screen and leave little to the imagination. DOA Ultimate is fun and while it's easy for anyone to pick up and play, those who are truly good at DOA know that there is skill involved. It is not just a button masher.This is, in the end, a remake of DOA 2, with DOA 1 thrown in for nostalgia's sake. As such, don't expect a revolutionary change in how the game plays. But the greatly improved arenas, the plethora of costumes, the addition of slope moves, and the implementation of Xbox Live play makes DOA Ultimate one of the best games this year. If you have enjoyed the Dead or Alive series to date, then there's absolutely no reason to shy away from DOA Ultimate. For those who aren't fans or those who have never given the series a try, I warn you that this is not Virtua Fighter, but it is the best brawler on Xbox, hands down.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
