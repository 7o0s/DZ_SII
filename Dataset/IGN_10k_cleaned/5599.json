OK, it makes for some pretty funny commercials -- like the one with Spike Lee yelling at the little girls -- but who knows if we'll actually get to see some hoop action this year?  Well, NBA Live '99 may be the closest thing to professional b-ball this season . . . and the great part is that you're in control of all the action.  Using NBA rosters accurate as of July 1, 1998, NBA Live '99 faithfully recreates the action of pro basketball down to the individual players and their signature moves.  You can choose from several different types of gameplay (exhibition, season, quick play, playoff, 3-point shootout, practice, and multiplay), giving NBA Live '99 incredible game diversity and its fluid movement makes NBA Live easy to play with a gamepad, joystick, or even the keyboard.  Gameplay is fairly fast, but you're in control of the action so you can slow it down with a heavy passing game if you're ahead, or throw the ball the length of the court to a waiting player in an attempt to score a fast basket if you're down a few points.  The computer AI is pretty good and even changes given the particular situation.  For example, your computer-controlled opponents will play even harder if they are behind, so your comfortable lead may quickly dwindle as they triple-team you and go for the steal.    In the setup options you can choose to play a real simulation or arcade-style.  While purists will want to stick with the more rigid simulation rules, casual gamers will certainly want to dish up a few buckets in arcade mode, where your players can jump ridiculously high and make the stoopidest dunks you've ever seen.  NBA Live '99 even lets you create your own players and teams.  So you can create a team comprised entirely of your friends and see how they fair against the Bulls or build your own Dream Team from all of the available players in the NBA.  Not only does it play well, but it looks good too. Each virtual player has a unique skin that matches that of his real-life counterpart.  Malone looks like Malone, Pippen looks like Pippen . . . it's really kind of eerie and freakish how real the players look. Utilizing motion capture technology, the designers at EA have incorporated actual player moves and animations and, with reflective lighting and rotating ad boards, even the arenas look amazingly realistic. There are a few graphical problems like overlapping polygons and vibrating players (the same epileptic seizure problem that's prevalent in most of the EA Sports games), but they hardly take away from the action and beauty EA has managed to capture with NBA Live '99. Even if you sit back and let the computer control the action, NBA Live is a pleasure to watch . . . almost better than TV because you get to see the individual player stats and you can jump in at any time if your team isn't performing well.  One of the best qualities of the other EA Sports titles is their spectacular use of realistic sports sounds and play-by-play commentary.  NBA Live '99 is no exception.  Al Poier provides the play-by-play calls, which really enhance the gameplay and gives you a televised feel.  The new coach, player, and crowd chatter is neat and the crowd goes crazy when the opposing team is attempting a free throw, egging them on to miss the shot.  So how does NBA Live '99 differ from NBA Live titles from previous years?  Well, there's new player moves, new facial animations, coach and crowd chatter, multiple season play which allows players to develop over time, and improved computer AI.  Plus it just plain looks a helluva lot better.   As good as it is, NBA Live '99 isn't perfect.  I did find a few minor bugs and quirks in the game.  For instance, the clock continues to count down when a replay of a good shot -- like that monster dunk you just jammed from the baseline -- is being shown. This only really becomes a problem when there is precious few seconds on the clock, you're down by two, and the computer just made a great shot that deserves a replay.  It only affected my game once, but those extra 7 seconds it took to replay the shot would have been very helpful in setting up an effective 3-point play.  Another problem I encountered was with camera angle.  While NBA Live '99 usually does a great job of keeping the camera centered on the action, when you're standing around the key waiting to rebound a free throw, the camera angle suddenly changes after the ball is thrown making a human-controlled rebound virtually impossible since you usually go running off in the wrong direction.  But these blemishes hardly take away from the action and charm of NBA Live '99.   Is it worth getting if you have '98?  Well, that's something I'll let you decide for yourself.   It is a great game and a solid improvement over last year's showing.  But, if you're a basketball fan who doesn't own a previous copy, this is the definitive basketball game for you.  -- Tal", "date": "Nov 11, 1998"}
