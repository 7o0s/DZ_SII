If you owned a PC, you would have undoubtedly played games such as Jazz Jackrabbit or even Commander Keen Episode I: Marooned on Mars, a game which would go on to spawn 6 sequels. Of course, gaming has evolved since then, with 2-d platformers going the way of the Dodo. Yet Billy Blaze or, as he prefers to call himself, Commander Keen, seems to have found one last hurrah, giving gamers a new chance to familiarize themselves with an old friend. Features Three levels of difficulty Three realms to explore More than 24 levels Password system Only for Game Boy Color   The Game Boy Color version of Commander Keen plays remarkably like its PC counterpart, which should come as no surprise. As 8-year-old Billy Blaze, you take to the skies in an effort to thwart the evil Vorticon menace, which threatens the very existence Earth. In true 2-d platforming pleasure, you'll hop around on a pogo stick while firing at the alien scourge with your trusty blaster at your side. It's nothing new to platform games (well, the pogo stick is a bit strange), but it makes for good gameplay. Billy will also have to collect numerous key cards and find different portals in order to make his way through the dank, dark, alien landscapes, but hey...he is Commander Keen and this is something he can handle.  Ok, well, perhaps he can handle it, but there are certain aspects of the controls that will make Billy Blaze's adventure a bit more unbearable. The problem lies in the pinpoint accuracy necessary to complete jumps correctly. More often than not, Billy will meet his untimely end simply because he couldn't make that one jump, that single leap which will cause him to fall into a crevice or spikey pit, killing him instantly. Ouch.  Timing in the game is crucial and, at times, seemingly impossible. Even with enough practice it seemed more commonplace to see Billy just plunge into the shadowy abyss, rather than grab that last keycard that could lead him to safety. Well what are you going to do? Just keep on pushing!  Where the game definitely stands apart from its PC family is graphically. The graphics have been upgraded, making the game seem more colorful, richer than what had been done on the PC. Yet the backgrounds and animations still seem lacking. Backgrounds are single layered, for the most part, as in the PC game, and overwhelmed with background details and objects -- which makes the game seem busy, in a graphic sense. Characters themselves also seem to have only 2 to 3 frames of animation, giving them an extremely choppy feel and sense to them.  In an overall sense, the graphic enhancements, while nice, could've been so much more with a little more love and attention.   While the graphics do make traversing levels difficult, level design in general seems well thought out and, with the exception of the numerous leaps of faith, somewhat of a challenge to get through. Boards are quite expansive and give Billy numerous areas in which he can shuffle off his mortal coil. Ideally, players will find themselves traversing the vast worlds in an effort to retrieve all of the well-hidden key cards (and many of the not-so-well-hidden-ones, too). As I stated earlier, key cards are an essential part of this complete gaming experience, allowing young Billy to travel to and fro through doors within the level. However, Key cards are often tricky to find, hidden atop the highest-most platforms within the game. Levels have been blessed with this over all simplicity, if you can call it that. Hop around the board, fry some aliens with your blaster, and find the key cards necessary to find the next area and then hop around the board, fry some more aliens and so forth and so on. It's no Mario, that's for sure, but it makes for an entertaining jaunt.   While Commander Keen was a fun game for its time, it certainly has shown its signs of aging. Many people will purchase this game for its nostalgic feel, while others will buy it in their quest to find another good platform game. Neither would be totally correct. Ideally, Commander Keen is a sound title, but when you line it up against more current titles it tends to fall a bit in comparison.  Interestingly enough, tough, even when given its shortcomings, it seems apparent to me that Commander Keen was meant more for console gamers, though the GBC incarnation is a bit rough around the edges.", "date": "Jul 6, 2001"}
