{"name": "Extreme Mountain Biking", "name_review": "Extreme Mountain Biking", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/16/extreme-mountain-biking", "text": "I've had a morbid fascination with the Head Games' Extreme sports line-up ever since Trent threw Extreme Paintbrawl my way nearly a year ago (quite literally ... he played it for about 30 seconds, hit the CD eject button, and chucked it as far away from his computer as possible).  I was so mesmerized, in fact, by how bad the series was that I even wrote and recorded a song devoted to everything Extreme!  So you can imagine how excited I was when I finally had some spare time to get around to playing Extreme Mountain Biking, the latest in the Extreme series.   Extreme Mountain Biking was developed by Creative Carnage, the masters behind Extreme Paintbrawl, a game that they actually admitted shipped without any AI routines whatsoever.  So, obviously, I was expecting a real dog of a game.  And, for the most part, I got what I expected.  Like most of the Head Games line-up, there's just not much here.  Sure, there are four different game types (stunt trials, single track race, downhill challenge, and gate racing), but the gameplay for each is basically the same: Push up, go forward.  Push back, stop going forward.  Push left, go right (whoops, had my keys mapped wrong, my bust ... now I'm going left).  Push right, go right. A monkey could play this game, and it looks like a few might have had a hand in its production.  While the stunt track does offer up a brief bit of excitement and the occasional trip to the 'Alt' key, the game basically boils down to nothing more than keeping your fingers firmly planted on the arrow keys.  And to make matters worse, the controls often lock up when multiple keys are depressed (a requirement for performing stunts) making it impossible to steer your bike.  As you can probably imagine, this makes it difficult to avoid the occasional tree and numerous promotional banners that are scattered around the courses.    So, the control system isn't quite up to par with big-budget games, but we can excuse some of the wonky controls because Extreme Mountain Biking is a budget title, especially if the actual game and course design is decent.  Well, it's a damn shame it's not.  The courses are a nightmare to navigate.  Instead of a well defined race path, you follow a floating green arrow which points in the direction of your next checkpoint.  You know, just like in real mountain bike racing.  And to make matters worse, the course areas are lined with invisible barriers.  Invisible barriers are the bane of gaood racing games.  At least devise a way so you can see that you're not suppose to cross the boundary, like adding a tree line.  This was particularly frustrating on the stunt track where you pretty much have free range of the area, catching air off of big hills and performing sick tricks in midair.  Well, I was making my way up a huge hill when all of a sudden -- *WHAM!* -- I hit an invisible barrier and flew off of my bike.  Now I know how David Rappaport must have felt when he reached the end of the world in Time Bandits.   There is one thing that surprised me about Extreme Mountain Biking, though: this Extreme title actually looks pretty good, at least for an Extreme game.  I mean I'm used to the Extreme line featuring characters comprised of upwards of 6 polygons floating on a blocky, grainy, flat background.  Imagine my surprise when the natural terrains were rendered in full 3D and resembled Tribes more than Extreme PaintBrawl.  There's not much variance in ground textures (it's basically just green or brown), but it all looks nice enough for a $20 game.  However, it still has its share of nasty clipping problems, and there was more than one occasion when my bike simply disappeared beneath the sands as if I was being swallowed by a sand worm.  Oh well, maybe the sand was just a bit loose that day.  As far as the audio portion of Extreme Mountain Biking goes, I can describe the entire soundtrack in five words: fwomp, fwomp, fwomp, fwomp, fwomp.  Bleech!  Horrible synth musak!  Get it off, get it off!  Even though I swear I did hear a riff from the Cars' ~Moving In Stereo,~ which then forced me to sing the song the entire time I was playing the game.  The most extreme part of Extreme Mountain Biking is the voice overs, and I do have to compliment the developers for at least using a different voice actor (or a number of different folks from around the office, which is probably a bit closer to the truth) for each individual racer.  Each of the bikers shout out phrases like ~Bam!, Kick It!, Yeah Baby!,~ and ~Who's Your Daddy!~ every time you hit a big jump.  This one feature alone made everyone in the IGN studios stop what they were doing and surround my desk for a few quick bellylaughs ... even Peer, and he never even breaks a smile.  They were all screaming, ~Hit another jump, hit another jump!,~ just to see what ridiculous phrase the biker would say next.  For some reason, several of the female characters would scream ~Hurt Me!~  Hmmmmm ... makes me wonder what the guys at Carnal Creations are into.  Of course, the ~Who's Your Daddy!~ makes me wonder, too.  In the end, I can honestly say that I've played the best game in the Extreme series to date, and it still blows. And what good is being King when you're the King of Crap?  Sure, it looks good, but there's just not much of a game here.  While the trials stunt track can be fun, the thrill lasts for less than an hour.  So, even at $20, you'd get twice the entertainment for a quarter of the price from a good movie.   Now pass the popcorn.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Sep 16, 1999"}
