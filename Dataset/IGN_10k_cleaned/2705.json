Dark Colony, from SSI, is the game and it feels just like a Sci-fi opera from a 50's pulp novella. Major Earth corporations are colonizing Mars when aliens begin attacking and you get to choose between playing the very alien biomechanical Grays or the industrialized corporate shock troops. Depending on the side you take, the game leads you through a surprisingly compelling plot and a wide variety of different terrain types including jungles, deserts and underground complexes.    Creating variations on the WarCraft/C&C model of real time strategy has become a cottage industry, with innumerable games attempting to recreate the play mechanics that made both games great while offering something just a little different so they won't be branded copy cats. Dark Colony sticks to the formula pretty closely, with a limited amount of Petra-7, the games only resource, available to both the aliens and the humans. The twist is that the vents on the planet's surface that you must tap to capture the Petra-7 can go dormant or become active without warning, introducing a certain amount of uncertainty into your resource planning.   Despite many similarities to the genre's mainstay titles, Dark Colony does do some interesting new things that will get real time strategy gamers excited. The construction cycle is based on a platform motif. The players starts with a single platform base, and improving the modules on that base yields better units. The base can be defended with perimeter defenses like auto missiles and mines, but the base itself is immobile. A cycle of day and night also makes quite an impact on how the game is played. Grays are nocturnal, seeing and fighting better in the dark, while the humans do better during the day.   The game ships in a Mac/PC hybrid box, so it may not be located with Mac software at all. Inside the box are actually two discs, though, one for PC, one for Mac, so if you have access to a PC you can play a friend over a LAN or modem.   Dark Colony doesn't break any new ground but it is still quite fun to play offering lots of single player action and a compelling multi-player component. The game is getting a bit older now and can usually be found in bargain bins or for a reduced price.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
