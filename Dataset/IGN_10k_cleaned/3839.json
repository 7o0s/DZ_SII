Better known to Japanese and American audiences as San Goku Shi and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the 113-year account of the reunification of second-century China is the most celebrated window into Asian culture there is. And while several of our readers have no doubt experienced the countless novels, plays, movies, and television shows dedicated to this incredibly popular subject matter, most of us were probably first exposed to it via KOEI's almost as legendary videogame series.   First released for PC and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, Romance of the Three Kingdoms has quickly become one of the hobby's most respected franchises. But as software and technology has continued to improve, so too have our expectations. And though its depth and scope have definitely enlarged over the 15 years since its initial inception, RoT3K is at its foundation, the same straightforward strategy/simulation title that kicked off the series so very long ago. Besides, how long can a terrific idea remain unchanged before falling victim to its own redundancy?   To answer that question with a resounding ~never~, KOEI has hit us hard with the PS2's second version of the franchise, Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII. Though not quite the leap over its predecessor that VII was in terms of technology or additions, Romance VIII still weighs in as the most feature-rich installment of the bunch. Much like Vice City was to GTA3, Kingdoms VIII manages to take all the great ideas from the previous title and refine them to an exact science. And what we get in return is not only the system's best strategy game to date, but further proof that the franchise still has a long life ahead of it.    Gameplay  Much as Romance VII opened up a world of possibilities by allowing users to assume the role of five different character varieties, Romance VIII allows players to select their destiny via six different class types. Unlike the older titles that limited the player to that of a ruler exclusively, however, Kingdoms VIII changes how the game works on a number of levels by altering the ways in which the player can participate. Little did we know just how effective this turn out to would be.   The most immediate difference is that ruler's no longer have complete control over everything in their empire. Cultivating land, investing in commerce, researching technology, repairing the castle walls, and patrolling the city are still very much a part of your ruler's every day life, but beyond the total sum of their command points (a pool that serves as a base for all activities per turn), your ruler's can do nothing else. The trick to becoming a successful leader in this class is learning how to delegate commands effectively and properly assert which of your officers is best for a given assignment. In an effort to keep your ruler from being completely helpless, however, KOEI has implemented a seasonal council meeting that adjourns every three months. It's in these meetings that players can set guidelines for cities and regions, prepare attacks, draft soldiers, and perform the more political and militaristic duties of the job.   Should players not want the awesome responsibility of becoming a Ruler, they may opt for the Viceroy/Prefect position instead. Invariably similar to the Ruler, Viceroys and Prefects have almost all of the same powers as their bosses - with a few small exceptions. Any decision you make that involves changing city policy or moving troops to different locations, for instance, must be approved by the Ruler, and if you yourself decide to move to another city, you'll lose your rank as the honcho of your town. It's a great class to play if you don't want to start off with all the liability and want to build up your prestige and statistics for several years before going out on your own. Once you've had enough of the boss, you can arrange a coup and succeed from his nation to start your own clan - but be warned: this doesn't go over very well with his empire and unless you can convince some his underlings to go with you, it could be a very short ride.    Next down the ladder is the Warlord. Known in earlier games as the Advisor, the Warlord is an officer that acts as the right hand man to the person who governs his city. Only available to those characters with an intelligence of 70 or higher, the Warlord's main responsibilities include espionage and organizing battles. A fun class to play and one of the most conducive to advancement, the Warlord can offer some unique challenges and toss you into battle more often than any other class but one: The Captain/Comrade class. Similar to the Warlord in scope, the Captain/Comrade class' main job is to act as military warhorse. Drafting, marching, and claiming land is what this character is all about - and he sees a lot of action.   Of course, none of the above classes are entirely necessary to win the game. The remaining two classes of Vassal and Free Officer can let you coast under the leadership of a ruler and do whatever menial tasks they ask of you; or you can wander the countryside in search of adventure searching for the Ruler that best fits your ideals. Regardless of which class you choose, however, every approach is different and when combined with the options that allow you tweak the difficulty level, adjust historical accuracy, or choose what period of turmoil to start within, no two games will ever be the same.   Battles and enemy aggression are more diverse too. Depending on territory, officers involved, the relationship between combatants, and the stakes, the tactics in warfare segments can change dramatically. If one character kills another character's brother, for instance, the one seeking revenge can earn special bonuses to increase his troops' morale in his quest.    In fact, the game's inclusion of relationships has a very important affect on everything. Players can get married, earn blood brothers, meet with friendly (and not-so friendly) rivals, and even develop mortal enemies based on the progression of events. These factors can strengthen or weaken ties with nearby countries and can save your hide on more than one occasion. There's a whole circle of influence dynamic going on here that means the more popular and close-knit your character is within his group of friends, the more likely they are to go out and find you new companions.   But that's only scratching the surface of what Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII has to offer. As everything we've seen in the previous games has been improved upon and expanded. There are over 600 historical officers in all with 100 character creation slots, there's skirmishes with almost no limit on how many sides can participate, and a new tactics system that diversifies units ever further. The hidden eight-player feature from Three Kingdoms VII is also readily available from the start and you don't even need a multi-tap to enjoy it (why bother with so many controllers in a turn-based game?). Pile on top of that well over 50 scenarios, a special ~all-officer~ fictional campaign, 80 different kinds of items, 100 exceptional events, and 40 different endings, and you have yourself one of the deepest games yet available for the PlayStation 2.   The only real downfall to Romance VIII is that the lack of micromanagement options from previous games could make returning fans a little disappointed. As user-friendly as the new structure and interface is, there's a lot to be said for being able to control every single officer on a point-by-point basis. Granted, doing such a thing in a game of this scale could mean taking a whole day out of your life just to play a single game year, but an option that would have allowed more experienced players to swap between delegation options and total control would have been ideal. Even so, with an A.I. as challenging as this, a built-in encyclopedia and tutorial, and a more realistic approach to troop relations on the battlefield, we don't have much room to complain (we'll wait until next time before demanding online).   Graphics  If there's a department in which the Three Kingdoms team has failed to meet modern day standards, it's with the visuals. At its graphical peak with Part IV on the Super Nintendo, KOEI's famous strategy series hasn't been competitive with contemporary videogames in almost a decade.    Using a two-dimensional, sprite-based layout mapped over nearly invisible basic polygons, Kingdoms VIII is still fastened to the imagery ideals of two generations ago. Only distinguishable by a richer color palette and examples of activity in cityscapes and battle scenes, the graphical engine that powers the game doesn't even come close to taxing the capabilities of PlayStation 2.   Duels and cinema events fair a little bit better with a 2D quality reminiscent of the early 32-bit versions and a few extra details. The most impressive example of eye candy in the entire game, however, is the introductory cinematic. All too brief and of the same quality of the cut scenes in the Dynasty Warriors series, it's the only segment in the whole experience that can match modern day competition. Either way, fans of the series already know what to expect with the game's visual style, and it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but newbies.    Sound  Surprisingly Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII appears to have even better music than last year's version. Faithfully reproducing (or remixing) some of the tunes found in Part VII, Romance VIII has a distinct Chinese flavor infused into every harmony. Interestingly enough, the newer compositions are extremely reminiscent of the original Record of Lodoss War OVA series, and have an almost mystical quality to them. If you're unfamiliar with that comparison, take comfort in knowing that just about every song is pleasant, soothing, and just as impressive as today's top RPGs   Just a minor step above 16-bit quality, the audio effects aren't quite as satisfying. The clang of swords, trampling of horses, and crackling of fire is clear enough for players to understand what they are, but the decidedly short sampled representations don't do much for the ears. It doesn't help that Romance VIII lacks current-generation surround technology either, and the music and effects will occasionally skip or stop mid-stream while the PS2 accesses the disc. This problem isn't a frequent one, but it does happen and the vocal segments are so sparse that they're barely worth mentioning.Though it wont appeal to everyone because of its turn-based tactical nature, poor graphics, and simple technology, its not a stretch of the truth to proclaim Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII the single best PSOne/PS2 strategy game ever released. Better than any previous title in the Romance series, easily eclipsing the Dynasty Tactics and Kessen franchises, and trampling all over the SimCity and Civilization ports, KOEIs excellent simulation of Ancient Chinese diplomacy and warfare is worthy of every compliment we can shower upon it.Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII is a truly special experience for any strategy or simulation fan lucky enough to play it, and if skeptical first timers are willing to sit down and give the game a try, it will be for them too. Just dont let the formidable learning curve or lack of things that explode dissuade you; and whatever you do, dont let it pass you by.", "date": "Aug 11, 2003"}
