IGN Wireless awarded it the Game of the Year for 2005 for its charm, accessibility, and incredible addictiveness. Gamevil could have easily farted out a sequel with different backdrop graphics and swapped out the whale for a dolphin, but instead opted to take the cast of Skipping Stone and drop them into a puzzler along the lines of Slyder and, well, Super Slyder. The results are certainly playable -- but if you're looking for the Zen of Skipping Stone, you might be disappointed. This puzzler can inspire some teeth-gnashing.   Instead of bouncing across a lake, the friendly rock star of Skipping Stone IQ must not fill holes in a series of grids on the beach and ocean floor. You direct a crab around the periphery of the grid and toss the stone in a straight line. The stone flies across the screen, shooting over the holes unless it hits a wall right in front of one. Once a hole has been filled by a stone, you can throw another stone to fill the hole right in front of it. You must also use angled bouncers to ricochet stones around the grid and drop them into holes. If you ever make a mistake, you can use a hammer up to five times to break a stone. These are useful if you ever get ahead of yourself a fill a hole near the border of the grid that ends up blocking a hard-to-reach one somewhere in the center.   You will soon encounter other obstacles that affect the stone's trajectory, such as starfish. These act as warps. When you throw the stone into one starfish, it emerges from the other starfish of the same color traveling in the same direction. Learning how to use each obstacle, which is introduced with a solid explanation of how to manipulate it to your benefit, is the key to working through the game's 99 puzzles. When you finally reach stages full of starfish, bouncers, and whirlies, you better bring your A-game. Skipping Stone IQ -- cute as it is -- knows no mercy.   As tough as these puzzles get, you do have a few special tricks in your beach bag. There is a ~direct~ power-up that, when assigned to a throw, lets you slide a stone into place without succumbing to the effects of any obstacle. You start the game with just one, but will find others along the way inside treasure chests. You also have occasional hints if you ever get stumped. There is typically just one solution to every puzzle, so thinking a few moves in advance is imperative. If you do need a push in the right direction, though, the hints will never steer you wrong. You just might wish you hadn't used it when the next puzzle grid is even more complex than the last.   After each puzzle, you are graded on your completion time and the way you attacked the grid. As you get faster and learn the intricacies of the puzzles, you'll slowly inch up the evolutionary scale. It's not even remotely scientific, but it's a fun way to judge your performance. You can also upload your scores to an online leaderboard and see if you're a super genius, or as slow as Cro-Magnon.   Much like the original Skipping Stone (and almost all Gamevil games), Skipping Stone IQ is drowning in charisma. The game is ultra-sugar-cute -- like you just jammed a Ho-Ho in the headset port. When you break a rock by firing it off-grid, it emits a baby-like cry like and jets of water spurt from its eyes. C'mon, why don't more games revel in silliness like this?  A smart puzzler with charisma earns a solid score on IGN Wireless -- shock and awe! Gamevil was wise to change things up for the Skipping Stone series before heading back to the original well for more rock-bouncing one-button action. (There is a Skipping Stone 2 in Korea... luckies.) The game's pacing is good -- you're given ample time to learn how to use each new obstacle before the game turns the screws once again, so even though it gets hard, it never feels mean. The game mechanics aren't entirely new; we've seen this style of game before, but if you're looking for a puzzler with charm, Gamevil's latest should not disappoint. Just don't download it expecting another skip across the pond.", "date": "Apr 5, 2007"}
