Capcom's Magical Tetris Challenge was just released to stores, and I've been tooling with the game for literally 10 hours straight. I waited until the last possible minute to put this review together, which is a good indication that this Tetris hasn't lost a beat. In fact, I will start out by saying that this version of Tetris is definitely the version to own...even if you have Tetris or Tetris DX.Features Seven different game modes Battery back-up Link Cable support for two players Only for Game Boy ColorYeah, I know what you're thinking...how could Tetris be done better? The big deal is that this is still Tetris. The game hasn't changed a bit, remaining the classic puzzler it always has been. And while you absolutely have to know the game by now, I have to do my reviewing duty and explain the general gameplay in a nutshell. So here goes:Blocks constructed of four square pieces (a total of seven different shapes) fall from the top of the screen one at a time, and its up to you to fit the pieces (by rotating them in 90 degree increments) in such a way that a complete horizontal line is formed. Once that happens, the line disappears and the pile of blocks on top of that line settles down a notch. This gives you more room to work with. The game ends when you fill the bin to the very top.Okay, but that's just the classic part of the game. While Magical Tetris Challenge has the standard solitaire marathon game, there are other options to take advantage of:Up/Down Tetris. In this mode, you're up against an unseen opponent (or a human player through a link-cable setup). Every time you clear a line, it gets sent to the other player with one gap missing (if it was a solid line, it would be completely unfair...wouldn't it?).Magical Tetris. Like Up/Down Tetris, you're playing against an off-screen opponent. Every time you clear a line, it puts a Magical Tetris piece in the waiting queue of the other player. A Magical Tetris piece is a more-than-four block piece that's much harder to place on a playing field. The higher the combo, the more Magical Tetris pieces get sent to the other player. But (and here's the big deal) if he clears more lines than you, his Magical Tetris pieces will pop out of his queue into yours. The more they bobble back and forth, the more they stack up...and grow. It gets a little crazy.Signal Tetris. Here's a hard-to-describe mode, and one that'll really throw Tetris fans for a loop. At the bottom of the bin is a pattern of red and blue lights. On top of that is another series of red and blue lights. Your task is to clear out lines in such a way that turns the red lights blue and blue lights red of the second line in the same pattern as the bottom line. The lights change when you clear a line, but only the light that's immediately under the last block that filled in the solid line will change colors. Confused? Well, you'll understand when you actually play it. Let's just say it's one of the hardest modes in the game.Tower Tetris. This is a standard game of Tetris, with one twist: your task is to constantly clear out the rising pile of gray blocks until a keyhole shows up. Clear out the line with the keyhole and you've passed the level.Target Tetris. This mode is very similar to the puzzle options in many of the Tetris clones on the market. Here, you're given a specific layout of blocks, as well as a specific number of Tetris pieces. You must clear out the acorn blocks with the given Tetris pieces  this mode teaches you the ~wrap around~ technique where you can rotate blocks into gaps where they would usually stop falling. There are approximately a hundred of these puzzles to solve.Harmony Tetris. Harmony Tetris is only available with a link cable  in this mode, you're actually playing Tetris together in different bins, but the lines you form won't immediately disappear. When you form a solid line, it'll stay on screen until the other person forms a line himself. You two must constantly clear out lines, otherwise it'll cause the other person's bin to fill up and end the game. It's a unique twist, but really, really odd.Sure, it's got Mickey & Co., but they do add a certain element  especially during the quest modes. That's right, quest mode. In this mode, you play one of four characters (Mickey, Donald, Minnie, Goofy), and must wander the land, challenging other Disney characters to games of Tetris. When you win these games, you're awarded a coin  get all the coins on your card and you win the game...uncovering a few hidden Tetris modes. All the modes above (with the exception of Harmony Tetris) are available in Quest Mode, and it depends on which character you challenge that determines the game you'll play.The Tetris game has been tweaked for the better  it's obviously giving early players guidance, since the bin is marked with tiny dots to show the columns and rows the blocks will fit into. The pieces also don't immediately lock into place when they hit another block  but that's the way I like it...it's kind of a last ditch option just in case you screw up. In some modes of Tetris, you'll also find a two block piece that can't be rotated...instead, it spits a limitless one block pieces into the bin every time you hit the button. This thing is a neat addition, and if you don't like it you don't have to use it.There is one single flaw in an otherwise perfect presentation: the records do not save the record number of lines cleared. This is mark we judge Tetrisphiles by, not by the points but by the number of lines cleared. It's a minor complaint, but it should have been included. I'm just glad the game has the battery back-up  there's nothing more annoying than a game that shows high-scores but loses them when the power shuts off.This is the Tetris game to own folks, even if you don't like the cutsy Disney characters. There's a ton of variety in this little Game Boy cartridge. The graphics are excellent, the music is catchy, and the control is right on...it's a perfect Tetris game. And since Tetris is one of the greatest videogames ever created, Magical Tetris Challenge well deserves a perfect 10.", "date": "Feb 29, 2000"}
