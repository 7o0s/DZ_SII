We could point the finger at Acclaim for making the development team crank out duplicate games for ECW: Hardcore (exactly the same as WWF: Attitude) and Mary-Kate and Ashley: Get a Clue (virtually identical to the first MK&A title on the Game Boy), but we're slowly coming to the conclusion that the development team is doing it to themselves. Just look at Godzilla The Series: Monster Wars and you'll see what I mean -- other than a few graphics and control tweaks, the game hasn't changed since the first Godzilla the Series title released last year.  Features Ten levels 16 different enemies Six different attacks Password save Only for Game Boy Color   The game's based on the now non-existent Fox Kids animated show, where Godzilla's the misunderstood hero that's used for good, but is always assumed to be the bad guy. Hey, if a 200 foot lizard was stomping though your town, I'm sure your survival instincts would kick in...until, of course, you become the inevitable toejam. Godzilla's at your command in the game's ten levels across desert, cityscapes, and the ocean floor -- but the problem is, though he's trying to save the world from the other giant creatures, the rest of the world is trying to put an end to Godzilla. So you'll have to use Godzilla's techniques to stop the constant flow of army attacks before they send him crashing to the ground, all dead-like.  I'm all for the idea of gigantic creatures in videogames (just read the Making the Game project and you'll see what I mean), but this game just isn't the way to do it. The most impressive aspect of Godzilla is and has been the lizard's size on the Game Boy Color...but that's really all it has going for it. You don't have full control over the big guy, and most of his attacks are generally useless outside of his fire breath. He can clawswipe and tailwhip, but they're all slow and limiting that you'll take more hits than hit the onslaught of enemy craft. So what's left is the fact that this game is just a side-scrolling shooter featuring the world's largest target.  What's worse is that the game's intention is a sequel to the title released last year, but all it really is is a repackage of the original. The game engine is nearly identical, only offering a slight control tweak -- in the new version you have the useless control over his walk, and the game now offers a crosshair target showing where his head's aiming. The graphics, like the vehicles and location backgrounds, have been given a slight upgrade, but it's the same Godzilla model used last year. Exactly the same.  The game's a lot harder than it was last year, so if you really liked the release last year, you'll find a much more challenging title this time around. Your blocking meter and health doesn't replenish by itself this time around, so it takes a bit more skill to keep your giant monster alive in the new game. But just a little -- you'll quickly learn the technique that'll keep you alive, and then it's a relative cakewalk.  This game is a side-scrolling shooter, and nothing more than that -- a disappointing design for a license that has so much potential. And they did it twice. The first time I can understand, but releasing this game a second time is just proof that the company did the sequel in a very short time with a tiny development team. It's an obvious, quick cash-in, and the ironic thing is that the license they're capitalizing on isn't the hot property on Saturday morning anymore.", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
