{"name": "Pain!", "name_review": "Pain Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/01/pain-review", "text": "It was somewhere around the time GameScoop's own Daemon Hatfield pulled back on the human slingshot, launched Jarvis through the air, snagged a grandmother by her hair, dragged her down a staircase leading to a subway and slammed into an exploding crate that I realized how much fun Pain can be.   Sadly, that fun only lasts for so long.   The newest downloadable game for the PlayStation Network, Pain charges you with launching Jarvis -- a spikey-haired punk with a Tarzan-like scream -- through the air and into a destructible downtown environment. You'll need to shoot the man into a picketer in a cow suit, bounce from there into scaffolding and try to make it to the exploding mailbox while a score keeps accumulating on the right side of the screen tracking the destruction you're causing.     See, each run at the city begins from a human catapult in a barren construction site. Your left stick will control the direction and angle of your 'pult's orientation, while the right stick moves Jarvis in the sling. Pull it all the way back, and Jarvis walks to the part of the device that is farthest from the front -- thus, putting more oomph into the launcher.    Sigh. You really should've paid attention in high school physics  or I should've.   Anyway, you move Jarvis around and your choices change the placement of the green arc depicting your path on the screen. You hit X, Jarvis flies and you use the left stick to control his drift while switching between left shoulder buttons/face button combos to do cannonballs, Superman poses and other hot dog moves. Drop the shoulder button magic, and you can use the face buttons to grab objects you come in contact with on your flight -- swinging from the suspended beam is sweet -- and hurl them into the town.   So, you have basics now and you'll need to take them into three single-player modes and three multiplayer modes. When you're all by your lonesome, PAINdemonium will unleash you on the city without any restrictions -- just rack up the points, young man; Mime Toss has you pluck a black-and-white Frenchie out of midair and hurl him through panes of glass while playing for the best time; and Spank the Money has you ram Jarvis into furry guys all over the city. If you have friends over, you can go at it in Horse (you'll have to hit a specific object and then try to pull off the best score to avoid getting the dreaded letters), Bowling hurls Jarvis at a set of pins while an opponent sets off obstacles, and Fun with Explosives shoots for high scores and big booms.   Bonk! However, PAINdemonium will be the main mode for your foray. There's no story; you just slam Jarvis into stuff and try to rack up the high score while pulling body-bruising moves such as Nutcracker, Stomped Grapes and Croth-a-licious and stringing these moves together for combos and bonuses.    Now, I know what you're going to say: ~Wait, Greg! You're a flippin' idiot! How can you string moves together if you're just launching yourself into things? You suck! IGN is biased!~ That's where ~ooch~ comes in.    See, after you collide with your initial object, you'll be able to press the d-pad to move Jarvis and that depletes an ~ooch~ meter at the side. As long as the word ~ooch~ has some coloring in it, you'll be able to get Jarvis to bounce around the environment. When he first makes contact, you'll be able to shake your Sixaxis and get ~Super ooch,~ which gives you even more range on your moves.    When Jarvis comes to a rest and the destruction on the screen has stopped, you can tap R1 and be magically transported back to the launcher to continue to wreak havoc on the town or tap select and have the whole scene reset. Sound complicated? It isn't. You'll get the hang of the basics pretty easily -- although cracking a million is going to take practice -- and be able to beat the hell out of Jarvis.    But what's going to keep you coming back to this single level that never ends? Trophies. Pain has more than 55 trophies stretched out across all of its game modes. There are simple awards for stuff such as your first grab and scoring 500,000 points with achievements ramping up from there as you're challenged to throw a mime 100 feet and travel 2,000 feet in one launch.    If you're a completist, there's a mountain for you to climb in Pain.     Now, here's my problem with the game -- and it's going to sound funky after talking about achievements -- this game just doesn't feel incredibly deep. Yes, there are trophies for 1,000 grabs, 5,000 ooches and 200 strikes, but there's one level and two characters. How many times can I watch the construction worker hammer his hand or slam Jarvis into the tunnel-blocking granny before it all starts to feel old? Keep in mind that every time I press select, the game resets to its default set of actions -- the cow walks in from the right, the train starts its path onto the screen and so on. It's like Groundhog Day.   Sony's solution? It would appear it is downloadable content, and that's a slippery slope.   When you boot the game up, you'll find you have access to Jarvis and unlockable Ed. However, beneath them are Santa and the curvaceous Cookie. To play as them, you have to buy them for 99 cents each. There are plans for new areas -- the ~Indoor Amusement Park~ is advertised in the game as coming soon -- but no plans have been announced as far as cost.    Why weren't these elements included? Right now, there's a ton of achievements with one barebones place to go get them. Ten dollars is a high cost of entry for something so sparse, especially when it looks as if you're going to be expected to fork over more money to expand the experience and keep you interested as you chase the trophies.   The first time I saw Pain was at Sony Gamer's Day in the spring. There, we were told the game's inspiration was folks watching idiots hurt themselves on YouTube, laughing at the hurt people and calling friends over to see it again.    That sharing aspect is lost in Pain.   Save Me, Monkey Although there's a robust replay system, you can't save your replays. There are leaderboards, but you have no way of seeing how your friends got their scores. There's a community section to the main menu, but all it links to is Pain's official website. But, perhaps one of the game's greatest flaws is the lack of online multiplayer. You can only play your games of Horse, Bowling and explosives locally. At the time of this writing -- the day after the game's release -- Travis Williams, a senior producer with Sony Computer Entertainment America, posted a few housekeeping bits on the Pain website. One of those pieces was that people were expressing their desire for online multiplayer and that the team would look into it.    Was this really something the team needed to be told? Wasn't the genesis of this game watching someone get seriously injured as a group?Pain is fun enough. Slamming Jarvis into the Manhole sign and then attempting to ooch him into the police car's path so that he can grab on and get propelled into the propane tank can be a riot. The game looks good, controls well and has lots of trophies to keep you going.However, the game is underwhelming and feels incomplete. You're paying $10 for two characters and one map that has the same routine every time you reset it. Leaderboards don't let you see how your friends racked up their score, there's no online multiplayer and the in-game ~Community~ is just a link to the Pain website. There seems to be a movement to include these things as downloadable content, but I can't review the game based on what it might be one day -- and even if I could, I'd still worry about the price of these additions. As of now, Pain can be fun but has a number of shortcomings that make it feel like a demo and hold it back from being the PSN standout it could've been.", "date": "Dec 1, 2007"}
