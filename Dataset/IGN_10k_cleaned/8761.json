With only a few weeks left until graduation, it's up to you to work your charms with the campus' many cliques, ingratiating yourself so that the brains of each social stratus ill feel compelled to help you with a particular subject. But every clique has its own agenda, so you must conform long enough to win their favor and get that coveted FU diploma.   After creating your custom avatar from a host of options -- the litany of costume and hair choices in impressive -- you get a crash course in campus life from your dorm roomie. You learn the ins-and-outs of controlling your student, navigating the campus map, and how to fit in with the different crowds. The sprawling campus is complete with lecture halls, cafeterias, frat houses, and work opportunities for making the necessary dough to pay tuition, buy nourishment, and essentially bribe the cliques.   You have a daily schedule and each task takes time. Just eating a hot dog carves a chunk off your waking hours. But you must balance setting aside time for homework, hygiene, and your social life if you want to succeed. The majority of your day is spent running errands for the cliques, such as the nerds, hippies, goths, and jocks. Each clique is skilled at a subject you're currently failing, but if you can get in good enough with the members of each clique, you'll ace. Pay attention to the information that follows each person's name when you approach them for clues into their personality. Some people like to talk smack about rivals, others want to discuss death and misery. Jocks love to talk sports. Hippies are down with charity. You must giggle, coo, fight, and fornicate to get in tight with the clique.   Earning the final trust of each clique is unique. The king of the nerds really wants a date with a cute waitress at the local diner, so you have to go soften her up and bring her back to your room for the waiting crush. (Important: You choose the gender of your avatar, which affects the later game. I played through as a boy student.) The goths want the dean's parrot for a sacrifice. The hippies want you to burn, un, incense in class to mellow the scene.   Gameloft has almost perfectly captured the essence of college life viewed through the prism of Reagan Era sex comedies. Think ~Revenge of the Nerds,~ ~Summer School,~ or ~Hamburger U.~ (Actually, scratch that last one.) The writing is silly and sly, but hardly afraid to go for some low hanging risqu humor when the opportunity presents itself. This may be the first mobile game that references herpes and shows standing coitus, albeit with some necessary pixilation.   The game looks like a natural descendant of New York Nights and Miami Night. The colorful, expansive campus is viewed through an isometric lens. The students and teachers are just shy of bobble-head proportions, giving face enough on-screen real estate to show a variety of expressions. Unfortunately, not all of the animations and moods match up with your conversation selections. I complimented a co-ed on her bodacious ta-tas, but it looked like my avatar was grimacing and shaking like he was at an anti-war rally.   There are some problems on campus, though: The work mini-games are just too easy and mindless. It's not a challenge to earn cash by assembling orders at a bar or a diner. Paying off tuition or buying things for people is never that tough. The hints at the beginning are great, but eventually you must turn them off or the game pretty must plays itself. And it's definitely too short.  While Crazy Campus is definitely modeled after New York Nights and Miami Nights, its linear story and more defined goals should appeal to casual gamers that may have been put off before. (Miami Nights has a lot going on... it can become overwhelming.) The writing is among the best seen in a mobile game -- it isn't afriad to be a little ribald. The game is definitely short, though, so expect to graduate in just a handful of mobile sessions.", "date": "Jul 5, 2007"}
