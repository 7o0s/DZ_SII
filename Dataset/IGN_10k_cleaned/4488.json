The game continues the Red Alert situation  quite simply, World War II never happened. With Hitler never having risen to power, the Soviet empire has stormed through Europe, and the Allied forces are out to stop them. Pick a side: become the Soviets and conquer Europe, or take control of the Allieds and eliminate the the Soviet threat.  If you've never played Command & Conquer, you've missed out  but here's the deal in a nutshell. In a point-and-click interface, you command your troops, from soldiers to tanks to airsupport, and attack the opposing side. You don't actually take control of them  rather, you just tell them what to do and they'll go out and do it. Each unit has its own abilities, and obviously the more you spend on them the stronger they are. In some missions you'll also build your fortress to train and earn your army, earning funds through the harvesting of materials. But since most game players have seen Command & Conquer in one form or another, I'm going to stop this abridged explanation right now.  Red Alert: Retaliation utilizes a more refined game engine from the PlayStation version of Red Alert. The menuing system for troop and structure management is a little easier to navigate. Retaliation also features the seven new units from the PC add-ons, as well as new video sequences specifically filmed for this PlayStation disc.  And if you've got two PlayStations with the link cable, you'll only need one copy of the game (since Retaliation spans two discs). There are 100 different two-player missions to play in Retaliation. Here's the problem I have with Retaliation  the developers expect you to have the gameplay knowledge from the original Red Alert. What happens is the first missions dump you into incredibly hard situations, assuming you know what to do and how to do it. Even I, who absolutely loves the C&C series, threw my controller at the television a half-dozen times...and that was during the first couple missions.The graphics, just like the first Red Alert, aren't much to write home about. But you can see your troops and vehicles pretty easily. Navigation does take a bit to get used to, and the PlayStation controller doesn't exactly have as much functionality as the PC keyboard (grouping troops, for example, isn't the easiest thing in the world to perform.). If you've never played PC Command & Conquer, pick up the original Red Alert first. You'll need the training before you jump headfirst into the damn tough situations of Retaliation. Only then should you pick up this game.", "date": "Sep 9, 1998"}
