While both games use squad-based combat to fight terrorists they both have their own unique flavor. Jungle Storm is the outdoorsy, fighting through open landscapes side of Ghost Recon where Rainbow Six 3 focuses more on clearing out buildings and going from room to room. As a follow-up to the original Ghost Recon, Jungle storm provides the franchise with a couple of much-needed updates and 16 new missions. It may feel like more of an expansion pack than a whole game, but it's got plenty of action in it.   If you're not familiar with the series, the Ghost Recon system uses squad-based combat in order to deal with some tricky terrorist situations. This means not just going in alone, but ordering a group of soldiers as well as fighting yourself. In the near future, Fidel Castro has finally kicked the bucket and the power struggle that followed has dictated that some foreign intervention is in order. Enter the Ghosts, elite soldiers from the United States who favor some quick and tactical moves over massive firepower. With two squads of three Ghosts each, a stealthy approach can have more of an effect than an entire army.   Gameplay  The original  Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon came out for both the PC, Xbox, and  PS2. This was followed up on the PC and Xbox with the expansion pack,  Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder, which contained eight missions and featured 16-player online matches for the Xbox version. With Jungle Storm, the series makes its way back onto the PS2 and adds an expansion pack of eight missions onto the Island Thunder missions. It also brings the series to PS2 online for the first time. Sadly, the large numbers aren't there and only six people can play against each other.   These new missions are a continuation of the Island Thunder missions in terms of the Cuban storyline, but that's the only connection within the game itself. In Jungle Storm, there are both sets of eight missions each, but progress in either one has no relation to the other. By completing levels, characters can gain new attributes, but these can only be seen in their own section. Instead of a complete game, the overall feeling is that of a compilation. Each section feels too short to be a complete game and without a continuation throughout the both sets of missions there's a lack of an overall adventure. There are plenty of chances to take down the enemies like there's no tomorrow with a steady stream of combat, but the missions stand alone and have little relation to each other. Think of Jungle Storm as a double expansion pack and you're right on the money.    Since the missions focus on the outdoor areas, Jungle Storm often becomes a sniper's paradise. Having squads to help you out is a definite bonus, but with many fields and pastures, it's often easy to go it alone and forget about the other squad mates. One of the main drawbacks to the open nature of the levels is the lack of suspense of moving around corners and being surprised by enemy locations. You can't just run around the maps, blasting away. Stealth is required here, but it's usually a matter of creeping over hills and firing from a distance. This is all well and good for a casual round of popping off enemies, but only a couple of missions show where the true flavor of Jungle Storm should have been.     One mission is set in a dock where enemies are hiding out on several of the boats and making it through alive was a matter of judging each and every boat and possible angle so as to avoid getting a bullet in the head. After numerous retries and several times where I had unwisely sent my men ahead into a crossfire, completing this mission gave a feeling of accomplishment. The challenge was truly overcoming the terrain and learning to use the nooks and crannies and cover to make it through. The open levels are more accurate, sure, but after a while it's not as exciting to creep into a field and take out all of the enemies who are just standing around.   It's not just that these open spaces make for some simple gameplay, but they also make them easy to get through for an experienced player. Playing through the 16 missions should take about eight to 10 hours. Once you get in the rhythm of moving slowly and picking the shots, the rest falls quickly into place.   Beyond the addition of more missions and the online component, there have been some improvements over the original PS2 version of Ghost Recon as well. These relate to the movement of the Ghosts themselves. It's now possible to quickly swap between any of the six characters to easily take charge of a situation. In other squad-based games like SOCOM: U.S Navy SEALs or Rainbow Six 3 where the control is only on the team leader, once the leader dies the game's over. Here, leadership can be easily switched. Unless the mission requires no casualties, a death is not the end of the world. Simply by holding down L1 and moving the analog stick, the next man is selected.   Another improvement is that waypoints are easy to set. Used to direct the other squad, waypoints are crucial in working together as a team. This is done in either the map or the first-person view. With the map, it's easy to set multiple waypoints to give a precise path. In the first-person view, placing the crosshairs on a flat piece of land and selecting it will set a red spot on the ground and the other squad will head for it. This is more useful for precise waypointing in a location where finesse is required. The addition of the realtime waypoints are a big bonus over the last game.    Despite the fact that the squad-based action may sound to be appealing for more hardcore gamers, the shooting system is geared more toward the easy-to-use side. A basic radar system gives an idea of how close and in what direction all of the nearby enemies are and when the crosshairs cover a target, they will turn red to indicate a definite kill. Both of these features are in the easy mode. The normal difficulty setting removes the red crosshairs and the hard setting removes both, but the shooting still feels a little automatic.     While sniping targets, aiming is a very imprecise science in Jungle Storm. Instead of aiming for the perfect headshot, it's often the case that close is good enough. Even while obviously a couple of feet off the target, I managed to get consistent kills from a couple hundred feet away. Instead of a simulation feel, Jungle Storm has a much more forgiving system. This is perfect for players who don't want to fuss with such details, but a letdown when you're lying down and waiting for the enemy to stop so you can get the satisfying headshot. Who's to know if you did it right when even a near-miss is fine for the kill?   The AI in Jungle Storm is both a blessing and a curse. The computer controlled members of the squad have an uncanny knack for spotting the enemies and taking them out quickly and effectively, but when hills and walls get in the way it can be a mess. I've watched a squad mate unload all of her ammo at a wall as she was trying to shoot at an enemy on the outside. I thought this was pretty funny until I switched to her and realized that she had wasted all of her bullets. Since then, I've noticed squad mates tearing into hillsides and small buildings. It's not enough to bring down the experience of the game, but it does go to show that Jungle Storm has a ways to go before it fleshes out the whole experience.   Combine the straightforward missions with some easy-to-use controls for the squad and assisted shooting and you get a game that will provide some fun for a few light-hearted afternoons. It's not overly deep or complicated, but it's a good introduction to some of the squad-based shooter action. For better or for worse, Jungle Storm is an extension of the original with more missions, but lacks the feel of a true sequel.   Graphics  Jungle Storm would have been amazing to look at if it was playing on a PlayStation, but on the PS2 it's a damn shame. The textures are blurry, there are woefully few polygons in the environments themselves and even still the movement can be a bit jerky, especially if the enemy is far away. The graphics do a good job of providing some feel for the different locales, but just don't try and zoom in close to anything. If you like polygonal blocks, chunky trees, low resolution textures and little detail, then this is your bag...    While the graphics themselves are manageable and the zoom functions for the guns are smooth, it's the jerky animations of the enemies that really stand out. While zooming in on a location with a sniper rifle, the enemies will teleport along instead of walking. It makes it extremely difficult to get a bead on a target when instead of a smooth motion to lead, the guy will be ~popping~ ahead, 10 feet at a time. If it weren't so easy to get a shot with the automatic aiming function, sniping would be out of the question.   One large problem with the graphics is not even in the 3D effects, it's in the 2D map. The maps for the stages come in two sizes: regular and super-pixilated. With one single image for the map, zooming in to get a better view only shows bigger squares that roughly display the areas. There is also only one zoom mode with no gradation of sizes in between. This makes giving orders of the maps more difficult and makes giving precise orders almost impossible. I kept wondering why I couldn't send my men to one spot until I actually got there and found it was a boulder.   Sound  The sound effects provide an effective backdrop for the action that goes on onscreen and off. With plenty of gunshot sounds and comments from your squad mates, it's easy to figure out what's going on without having to check the screen. The different guns have their appropriate sounds so you'll know if it's a sniper rifle or an assault rifle that you need to be on the lookout for.   Musically, it's filled with military-style music, the kind you'd hear on a military commercial or in an opening sequence of any generic military movie. In other words, if you have heard a Tom Clancy game before, you won't hear anything surprising here.For a session of quick and easy sniper missions with some squad-based elements, Jungle Storm fits the bill for a few afternoons of crawling through fields and cleaning up Cubas political landscape. There are plenty of problems with the graphics and the lack of an overall feel for the whole game, but with a game that's easy to pick up and play, Jungle Storm provides plenty of sniper and squad action. Recommended for those who need their sniper fix or for those who are new to the genre.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
