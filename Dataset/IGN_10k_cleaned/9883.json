But while the feeling of wanting to scream, pull your hair out and snap your controller in half could be found in several NES titles, few adventures so perfectly packaged the pain as Capcom's Ghosts 'N Goblins. This game was so tough that it required true dedication and true lack of common sense to master its madness, as time and time again your hero found himself reduced to a dead and dormant stack of bones. And now the frustration is available again, on the Virtual Console. It seems true madness never ends.   The two 16-bit sequels to this game are already available in the Wii Shop  Ghouls 'N Ghosts from the Genesis, and Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts from the SNES. Those titles follow the continuing adventures of Arthur, the knight in shining armor who sets out across a somewhat-cartoonish land of horrors to rescue the kidnapped Princess, Prin-Prin. And those titles present Arthur as a fairly capable and worthy hero, able to power himself up, throw weapons in multiple directions, cast magic spells and more  but those are the sequels. This is the original.   And in the original, Arthur can do none of those things. Here he's a hero whose only abilities are to run, jump and duck, as well as to throw his current weapon either directly left or directly right. He takes two hits before dying  the first removes his armor, leaving him exposed and in his underwear, while the second kills him outright. He can find an upgrade to restore his plate mail if he's lost it, but that collectible appears so rarely that you may never see it show up at all. This is a restricted warrior, friends.   This massive Cyclops is no match for my many dinky daggers!  The later games in the ~GNG~ series retained some of Arthur's old-school restrictions purposefully, to maintain the feeling of his control in later years. But in this first Ghosts 'N Goblins adventure, the old-school can be oppressive. Arthur runs, crouches and jumps incredibly stiffly, with no fluidity at all to his movements on the screen. And he can't change directions in mid-air after he jumps, so you have to hope you placed his leap well before you hit the A Button.   The enemies are much more mobile, swooping down in diving arcs, carving sinusoidal waves in the air or rushing straight at you head-on  it's nearly impossible to dodge some of them, so you have to hope a well-timed strike with your flying lance, torch or dagger will do them in. Many foes take multiple hits, though, and will plow right through your assault to kill you anyway.   And even worse are the parts of the game with no enemies at all, but moving platforms instead. That locked-in jumping style that forces Arthur to commit to the initial direction of any leap turns out to be maddening when crossing bottomless pits, and there are enough of those scattered throughout the quest's six levels that you'll certainly be seeing Arthur tumble into quite a few before the end of the journey.   One thing that does help to counterbalance Ghosts 'N Goblins intense challenge is its unlimited continues, which let you start over again and again on the same stage even if you get a Game Over. And most of the levels have mid-stage checkpoints, too, so you aren't thrown all the way back to the beginning when you fall in battle. But still be warned that, even with those helpful elements in place, Ghosts 'N Goblins is a truly difficult game that will very likely cause you more frustration than fun.In our past reviews of ~GNG~ titles on the Virtual Console, we've praised Arthur's adventures as difficult, but addictively fun  which they are. Both Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts are solid games, and are definitely worth your consideration for download. But this installment, the original NES Ghosts 'N Goblins, is comparatively even more difficult and potentially frustrating, to the point where its value as a VC selection rests well below its sequels. So check out the 16-bit installments first and see how you like them. Then, if you truly enjoy the difficulty they offer and want an even more elevated level of challenge, come back to this first home console edition of the franchise and give it a go as well.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
