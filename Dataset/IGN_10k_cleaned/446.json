While it isn't a great basketball videogame and it needs some improvement in many areas, NCAA Final Four 2000 is a solid effort that should keep 989's fans busy until they release NBA Shootout 2000 (assuming that it actually does make it to store shelves).  Gameplay 989 Sports has earned itself a reputation for packing its games full of features that die-hard sport fans love (and expect) to see in their games. NCAA Final Four 2000 lives up 989's solid reputation as it comes packed with over 300 Division I-A teams and gives the hardcore sports fan just about everything that one would expect to find in a college basketball videogame.   The game options that are available to the player include a Quick Start game, Exhibition Game, Season, Tournament and an Arcade game. In all of these modes, you can adjust the length of the half's, the speed of the game, difficulty of the game, and turn on or off features like injuries, fatigue, fouls and touch shooting. There are four difficulty levels (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior) which affect the computer's offensive and defensive skill levels.   In addition to making the computer play smarter, upping the difficulty also makes it harder to make open shots, easier for the computer to steal the ball and harder for the player to steal the ball from the computer. The player will also need to work harder on getting open shots because the computer will block more shots as you up the difficulty level.   One of the game's negative aspects is that there is generally an overabundance of steals and blocked shots in any given game. Whether playing with top-quality teams like the Duke Blue Devils, or lesser teams like the Delaware State Hornets, getting in excess of 20 steals per game by a single player happens way too much. The CPU will also typically end up with steals and blocked shots numbers that far succeed anything you'd normally see in a real college basketball game.   The best gameplay feature in Final Four 2000 is the Touch Shooting, which was first introduced in last year's Final Four. This feature utilizes a shot meter that appears when the player is attempting to shoot the ball. As you shoot the ball, the red bar will rise on the shot meter and you're supposed to release the shot button once it reaches the yellow triangle. Depending on the skill level of the player and the distance that the player is from the basket, there is a varying amount of green area that allows for some inaccuracy in hitting the yellow triangle.   The controls are very responsive and the players have a variety of moves at their disposal. You can execute advanced moves such as crossovers, behind-the-back dribbles and spin moves all with the press of a button. And you can setup quick plays such as give-and go's, alley oops, and screen plays almost as easily. The free throw meter is a little awkward at first, but it does a good job of making it easier to make foul shots with people that are good at the line and more difficult for those who are not.   In addition to making use of the rumble feature, it also takes advantage of the analog stick on the Dual  Shock. Although, the analog stick is really only used in a digital fashion and doesn't provide true analog control.   Graphics Graphically, Final Four 2000 is one of the better looking basketball games currently available on the PlayStation. 989 has once again done an excellent job of creating quality 3D motion-captured players that animate smoothly and significantly enhance the overall realism of the videogame.   The player models are scaled accurately based on the height and weight of the player they represent and there is an extensive array of new player animations like players congratulating each other and coaches yelling orders from the sidelines.    One gripe is that the game has substandard and limited ball animations. You'll see the ball spin around the rim and then pop up and out more in Final Four 2000 during one game than throughout an entire year of watching basketball on TV. There are rarely any long rebounds from long distance shots, because the missed shots generally do what I just described above.  Sound Overall, 989 Sports has succeeded in recreating the true college basketball atmosphere with the audio in Final Four 2000 with play-by-play commentary by Quinn Buckner, school fight songs and crowd chants. Although, when compared to EA Sports' NCAA March Madness 2000 in this area, Final Four still needs some improvement.  The big question that is likely on most of your minds is whether to buy 989's NCAA Final Four 2000 or EA's NCAA March Madness 2000. That question will get left unanswered at this time as we've yet to get our hands on an actual review copy of March Madness. As soon as I'm able to review March Madness, I'll be able to give my opinion on which college basketball game is superior. As is, Final Four 2000 is a very solid college basketball game. It just isn't a great game by any means. There's a lot of room for improvement in this game and hopefully 989 will make those improvements in its NBA game, assuming it actually comes out this year.", "date": "Nov 24, 1999"}
