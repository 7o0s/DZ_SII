Offering a number of innovations, it stood as a challenge to the Warcraft and C&C clones that made up too great a percentage of the RTS market. A clearer and more manageable command concept, an economic model that rewarded efficiency rather than hoarding, the either/or approach to town development; all these features combined to make Kohan a real standout.  And the sequel is even better than the original.  The story of Kohan 2 is told through a 25-mission campaign. It begins as the immortal warriors known as the Kohan are rebuilding after the Great War against Ahriman and the Ceyah. At the start of the game an unknown force launches an attack on the borders of Istaria. Fearing that it's the Ceyah, the Istarians send out a Seeker named Naava Daishan to check things out.  You begin by leading this force against the invaders. I won't spoil the story here by telling you who's involved and what they want but I should give you some indication of where the story goes from here. As you make your way from battle to battle here, you'll recruit other allies across the world of Khaldun. This gives you access to a variety of unit types and gives you a chance to play with each of the sides.  The game makes an unnecessary and jarring switch at one point, letting you take charge of the evil forces as they run from the hero you were previously leading. This just seems distracting to me and it kind of kills the emotional momentum of the game. Some of these missions are very enjoyable but since there's a story point much later in the game that opens up some of the evil side's units for use by the good characters, I'm not sure why it's important to play through five or six missions as the enemy here. My only other criticism of the story is that it seems to suffer a bit from an abundance of climaxes towards the end.   I'm intentionally being vague about the details because the story itself comes with some pretty interesting twists and surprises. Sure, you can see some of alliance shifts coming a mile away but, even so, they're exciting moments in the story. Fans will also be happy to see how this game eventually connects with the characters and events from the prior games.   Even people who weren't Kohan fans originally will still appreciate the game's tighter focus during the missions. Until a few years ago it seemed that 95% of real-time strategy games focused on wiping out your enemy as the main mission objective. In the last few years, a lot of developers have focused on limiting the player's responsibilities within a mission to add a little more direction and tension to the experience. Kohan 2 frequently features missions where you're leading a small force within a bigger conflict. This gives you a chance to have meaningful tactical interactions with your allies and adjust your actions to the rhythms of battles that don't directly involve you. This means that if you're trying to lift a siege or track down an enemy, it's not the only thing going on during the mission.  Though we frequently lament the industry's reliance on elves and dwarves as fantasy staples, one possible problem with Kohan 2 is that it just isn't a world that's familiar to players. This means it requires a little more effort on the part of the player to ~read~ the game. If I see an army of dwarves coming my way, I know what to expect from them. Players of Kohan 2 have to get used to a new set of races. You'll eventually be able to separate the Haroun from the Gauri of course but in the end, you'll find that the differences between the races is largely cosmetic; the only meaningful differences that you absolutely must understand are those that relate to the combat units.  The best part of this entire series has been the company creation system. In Kohan you build groups of units together and lead them into battle in companies. Each company is composed of a leader, four frontline units, two flank units, and two support units. Though finding the right combination of units is key to success here, there's no one right answer for all situations. Some may prefer a frontline of infantry with archers on the flanks and wizards in the rear. Others may opt for cavalry in front and on the flanks with healers as support.      The combinations become important because the tactical AI takes charge of which units fight each other. You can't simply order all the units in your company to attack the lone healer standing at the rear of an enemy company. Instead you'll have to build units that have good overall performance.  When you add the multipliers and bonuses that come with attaching Kohan captains to these units, you can really tailor the companies to match your needs.  Although it seems like it takes it a bit easy on you during the campaign, the enemy AI offers a reasonable challenge for most RTS players. It's aware of facings and formations and uses positions well. It's also capable of drawing the player away or diverting his attention from a secondary attack. The game's three formations allow you to shift the emphasis from speed on the field to effectiveness in combat. I'm disappointed that there aren't any options any longer for putting multiple companies in a single formation but, since you'll rarely be leading more than a dozen companies in most of the missions, this isn't too much of a problem.  You'll need to worry about keeping at least one member of each company alive during every battle. As long as one unit of a company makes it out, you can send them back within your own supply lines to be rebuilt. Each town in the game has a supply ring around it and will automatically heal any friendly unit that steps within that radius. This is even true of the Kohan leaders. Where the previous games required you to pay gold to revive fallen leaders, the new automatically revives them but resets their experience level to zero. This makes it easier to get your heroes back but still manages to put a priority on keeping them alive in the first place.   The economic modeling has always been one of the most intriguing aspects of the series' design. Though Kohan offers up the resources of gold, mana, iron, stone and wood, gold is the only resource you'll actually stockpile. The other four resources are rendered as a net income or loss per minute. If you have a few companies of archers with a magical support unit or two, you may find that they eat up a few units of wood and mana each turn.  As long as you're producing a surplus, you'll be fine. The extra wood and mana that you generate each turn are automatically sold for gold which is then placed in your treasury. If you're not producing enough wood or mana to keep them in the field, you'll suffer a net loss which will be offset by a gold outlay from your treasury.  It's much less confusing in practice than it is in description. Moreover, it's an economic model that encourages the player to find the right balance of resources to support their armies. Having too much iron ore is alright as far as it goes, but it means that you're not developing your settlements and armies to their full potential. It's a really great system that puts the focus on resource management rather than peasant management.  One change from the previous games is that you no longer have to envelop your resource nodes within your supply lines. Instead of building towns and outposts near key resource points, now you can simply send your engineers out to build a mine wherever the resources are found. You'll still need to protect these nodes of course but the game now allows you to build forts to protect them. These forts come with their own garrisons who can (hopefully) fend off an attacker long enough for you to move some troops in for support.  Towns are protected the same way but they'll have the additional advantage of being surrounded by walls. Some of the larger towns will also force the enemy to destroy the surrounding buildings before attacking the town center. One of the more interesting features of the game is that you can issue a single order to attack the town center directly and your attacking forces will carry out the entire assault on their own. First they'll take down the walls, take out any defenders, destroy any buildings in the way and finally assault the town center itself. This definitely frees you up to deal with other tasks in the meantime (or just to sit back and watch the assault play out).  In a change from previous games, you'll actually see the individual structures within each town on the map itself. For those who don't know, each town size can support a certain number of buildings -- lumber yards, barracks, etc. -- and you never have enough slots to build everything you need to. Each town takes on a really distinct flavor as a result. Unfortunately, given the nature of defenders and town assaults, you'll never see any purpose to taking out certain structures in a town. While Age of Kings might reward a player for sneaking in a taking out a smithy or stable, in Kohan 2 it always makes more sense to wipe out the town completely.      Another big change is that towns can't be built just anywhere. Like in Rise of Nations, potential town sites are limited by the map designers. This eliminates the need to build a long string of towns to key resources or targets and gives the overall conflict a little more focus.  Though we didn't particularly fault them for it, the 2D graphics of the first game caused it to be passed over by gamers looking for something a little flashier. Well, Kohan 2 finally offers up visuals that match the freshness of the game mechanics. I was genuinely awestruck by some of the spell effects which are definite highpoints for the genre. While it's not as unusual to see these effects in action or role-playing games, you just don't offer see such fantastic particle work and attention to lighting in RTS games. It's as aesthetically pleasing as it is technically impressive.  But though that's the high point, that's not the only part of the game's visual presentation that's worthy of praise. The unit animations are varied and full of life. I love the way that the cloaks snap up in the air whenever a character casts a fireball. The units themselves are a bit blocky but the overall designs are quite nice and more than sufficient given the scale of the game.  The environment that these fights take place in is almost as good. There's a lot of personality in the world, from running streams to swaying trees. In terms of overall personality, it's not quite on par with something like Battle Realms, but you definitely get a sense of the reality of the world. I think the tree cities are my favorite.   You can get a good look at these features thanks to the game's rotating, zooming camera. There's no option to tilt the angle up or down and I'd have loved to zoom in even closer to the action but, as it is, the camera does a good job of letting you see the action in a details-oriented or big-picture format.  The game's sound is pretty good across the board. For the genre, the voice acting works well. There's lots of personality in the voices for the different characters. (This is helped somewhat by little talking heads like those in Warcraft 3.) Battle sounds are generally satisfactory and the music definitely supports the martial character of the game.  Once you're done with the single player campaign, there's still a lot to enjoy about Kohan 2. Granted, the linear nature of the campaign means that there's no real reason to go through it again, but the multiplayer and skirmish options add a lot of life to the title. There's a random map generator and an editor to help keep things from getting stale. I couldn't find an option for direct IP connections so you'll have to use the Gamespy browser to find the games you want. Though there are a few holes in the game's overall presentation, TimeGate's done a wonderful job with Kohan 2. Any RTS gamer who's tired of the same old crap will definitely enjoy the unique take on the genre. There's certainly been more innovation among RTS titles over the last few years but Kohan 2 still stands out as one of the best. The mechanics are solid and the visual presentation is honestly better than I expected.This week puts RTS fans on the horns of a dilemma. Kohan 2, The Creative Assembly's Rome: Total War and Relic's Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War are all being released within days of each other. This is what we cynics like to call ~an embarrassment of riches.~ The good news is that each of the titles offers a clear and distinct approach to the genre, both in terms of mechanics and content. That, at least, should make the decision easier. One thing's for certain however: those gamers who choose Kohan 2 will definitely not be disappointed.", "date": "Sep 21, 2004"}
