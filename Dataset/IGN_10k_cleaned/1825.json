It's still a game that won't appeal to the meticulous baseball purist and it's only a negligible enhancements over last year's title, but it's still clearly the best that the series has yet to offer on Sony's celebrated gaming console.   As with we've come accustomed to from the series, Triple Play Baseball gives gamers an ample amount of gameplay features, customizability, and roster management, while not really offering everything that the diehard fan really looks for in baseball game.   For one, while you have the ability to perform trades, sign free agents, create players, shuffle your batting order and adjust your pitching rotation, trades are limited in that you can only trade for an equal number of players and there's not an option to go with a four man rotation. Because of this, the gamer can't easily emulate trades that happen during the season, which often include uneven numbers of players. And real-life baseball strategies that pertain to the use of a four-man rotation or the arm strength of a starter wearing out over the course of a year never come into play.   Statistical tracking is another area where stuff is a bit on the slim side. All the major team and player statistics are tracked and league leaders are kept, but all of the regular season stats are completely wiped out when you move from the regular season to playoffs. The season stats should be left alone and playoff stats should be tracked independently, and there's no reason at all to completely eliminate everything that the player has worked for over the course of a season. Sure, some people might not care about stats at all, but the chances are that if someone's going to play through an entire season, they're going to be the type of person that would like to have his stats kept.   The create-a-player, on the other hand, is actually fairly adequate. Players can be created with a variety of attributes from the normal stuff like height, weight and handedness to more advanced stuff like batting eye, batting power, reaction time and arm strength. Plus, there are more than 20 different batting stances that can be used, such as Ken Griffey's or Cal Rikpen's general styles, and there are 10 different pitching styles available including the styles used by players like Randy Johnson or Kevin Brown. The only real deficiency in this area is the fact that it's not possible to adjust and alter the attributes of current players on the game's roster.   Even though it's not something that the purists will necessarily adore, Triple Play Baseball does make up for some of its shortcomings in the feature set with the inclusion of cool extras in the form of its Big League Challenge Mode and Season Mode Points Play. The Big League Challenge offers a variety of home run derby type games that are a lot of fun to play and a good way to kill time with friends or alone. And with the Season Mode Points Play, players can earn points throughout the season by doing stuff like hitting home runs or getting double plays, that can be used to open up secrets, such as hidden stadiums, or upgrade the abilities of current players on their rosters. This is definitely not something that helps make Triple Play a better baseball game, but it definitely helps make it a more enjoyable videogame.  Gameplay This trend of being good, but not exactly for the purists, continues with the actual in game action. There are two different batting modes, which can be viewed from high, medium and low perspectives, with the easy mode requiring the player to only worry about the timing of the swing and the hard mode giving him a box-like cursor that can be moved to nine different positions. Users can also move the player around the batters box have him use an open, normal or closed stance, with simple clicks of the shoulder buttons.   It's simple and easy to use and gets the job done, but the hitting facet is somewhat hampered by the fact that the variety of hits off the bat is a bit limited. Over the course of a game or season, players will see all sorts of hits off the bat, including foul balls and infield pop-ups, but the frequency doesn't seem to match real-life in that there are very few ground balls in comparison to line drives and grounders through the infield, and especially up the middle past the pitcher, are far to rare.   On the pitching side of things, everything's pretty much handled the same way that fans of the series are used to. Pitchers have four or less pitches in their arsenal and after choosing the type of pitch, the user can then choose the direction in the zone for a strike or a ball, and then the speed of the pitch can be determined by how long the button is held down. The only significant problem here is that in cases where you're dealing with a pitcher that has more than four pitches in his arsenal or more than a single kind of fastball, you won't get a completely authentic experience here in Triple Play Baseball.   The baserunning is also handled exactly as it was last year, with the ability to use the X button for a speed burst to help beat out singles or leg out doubles. The general speed and quickness of the baserunners seem in tune, with most hits that should be doubles for a fast player, but a single for a slower player, actually working out that way. Over the course of a season, players will see mistakes in this area, such as players getting thrown out from the outfield at first base, but it's generally not too bad.  Graphics On the visual side of things, Triple Play Baseball is one of the best looking baseball games that you'll see on the system and the framerate isn't quite the problem that it has been in past years. There are some areas of slowdown or general choppiness by it's typically not too bothersome and only really comes into play when playing the game on the faster speed settings when trying to field hard hit grounders through the infield.   As far as the player models are concerned, this game offers the most realistically proportioned players that you'll find on PlayStation and even on PlayStation 2. The players have the right shape and size and their body parts are all proportioned like real human beings. The texture detail is also really nice, with the only real negative being that the background textures used for the stadiums seem very unclear and a bit muddled.  Sound Triple Play Baseball does equally as well in the area of audio. The play-by-play and color by Buck Martinez and Jim Hughson is pretty standard stuff on the hole and does get repetitive over the course of a season. But there are some very good commentary moments where baseball history is brought into play, such as the mention of how Carl Yastrzemski was the last player to win the Triple Crown and that Rafael Palmeiro came close to it last season. The only problem with this kind of stuff is that you'll start hearing the same comments over and over a lot when you play through a full season.   The game makes use of a lot of spiffed up sound effects for when balls are hit hard and when balls go into the stands, but whether or not this is a good thing is up to each individual. Purists will surely wish that EA Sports included the option to completely turn these sound effects off while the casual fan probably won't care much either way.  After having played through an ample amount of both Triple Play Baseball and 3DO's High Heat Baseball 2002, I can say that I'm still not completely satisfied with any baseball game on PlayStation. High Heat actually has a lot of the sim features that I look for in a baseball game but has some shortcomings in its execution. And, while Triple Play Baseball is a solid game of hardball and one that can be enjoyed by the casual fan, it's not for the diehard baseball freak. Nonetheless, it's the best game in the series on PlayStation and if you've liked the previously released Triple Play games, then you'll definitely want to pick this one up.", "date": "Mar 7, 2001"}
