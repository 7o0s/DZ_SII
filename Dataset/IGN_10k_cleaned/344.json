Sure, it's a tad difficult to make a good baseball game, however that shouldn't be an excuse. Since the release of Triple Play '97 and World Series Baseball II, it's almost a waste to even purchase this game.  What can we say?  This game is stuck in a time warp. The game stats are out of date, the whole at-the-plate cursor deal is played out, and the batting view, well, we can't even see who's on first base. This reminds us of an old Abbott and Castello act.  Even though MLB may lack excitement, it's still a strong baseball sim with all the perks:  Home Run Derby, 28 MLB Stadiums, World Series and Season options, yadda yadda yadda.  It's all there, but it just lacks excitement.  MLB Pennant Race would make a great PC game. For the console however, it doesn't quite make the draft. SNK's Baseball Stars for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a better alternative.", "date": "Dec 18, 1996"}
