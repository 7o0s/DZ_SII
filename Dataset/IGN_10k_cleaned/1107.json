Leave it to HeadGames to defy reason when a corporate sponsor comes a callin'.  If you've ever entertained fantasies of running a stable at one point in your life, you might be impressed early on by the concepts behind Daily Racing Form Horse Racing.  Once you get the game loaded up, you'll want to jump right in a start making money, but, as in real life, it's not quite that easy. Without first buying a horse, it's terribly difficult to enter a race, so first you'll have to take some moolah down to the glue factory and see who you can save from certain death.  Colts, fillies, stallions.. you name it, they're all here, and they all need a good home and training program to improve those attribute scores.  Treat 'em good or fill 'em up with steroids and you'll bring home the big bucks.  Turn the lights down low, throw some Marvin Gaye on the stereo, and they may even produce a little tyke with star potential.  As a reward, you'll get to give your steeds catchy professional names like ~Sleeps with Midgets,~ ~Sweetmeat,~ or ~Lingering Stench.~  Keeping a horse fed, groomed, and well cared for is an expensive proposition.  To maintain a respectable farm, your freeloading four-legged friends need to prove their worth on the track.  Afternoons at the clubhouse pass by in the blink of an eye as overgrown ponies compete for prize money and their owners play the odds and put markers on race outcomes.  Going bust is never really a concern though, because you can always get more cash by playing trivia or clicking on sponsor links.  Say what?  No joke, there's a built-in marketing gimmick that lets you earn more cash in the game by collecting codes picked up by visiting sponsors' websites. Mmmm, that's corporate bootlick like mom used to make. Thanks HeadGames!  At the starting gate, the action switches over to a 3D view of the track.  While a guy with a crusty British accent shouts out position updates, the horses thunder around the bend in realtime.  You're forced to watch the race unfold to collect winnings, but having to play jockey isn't mandatory.  If the option to hire a computer rider is declined, you'll dust off the mouse, grit your teeth, and use left and right clicks to control the speed of the beast.  Horses tire easily, and the difference between a first and last place finish is determined through pacing and stamina management. In case you haven't figured it out, this isn't much fun and eventually you'll just decide to stick with the computer jockeys.  Obviously, the system of play comes off looking pretty crappy on a shallow level.  But the game's troubles run much deeper, as the effects of practice and training aren't clearly reflected by your moneymakers' performance.  Freeware quality sound effects and graphics add to the discomfort.  Topping it off, there's no incentive to stay at it besides the opportunities to amass great wealth or mash it up with other players online.  While Daily Racing Form Horse Racing is a cut above the average Extreme title, that's not saying much.  This one's a snoozer, but it's hard to place all the blame on any one area, so take your pick from the horrors that are available to you.  Is it the unattractive presentation, inane gameplay, or underlying concept which doomed the game to less than mediocrity from the get go?  99.9% of the consumers out there will never know, and frankly they're better off that way.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jul 15, 2000"}
