{"name": "Dino Crisis", "name_review": "Dino Crisis (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/14/dino-crisis-import", "text": "You can label me an easily-amused mental midget, but I liked The Lost World. Yes, both Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg sold out big-time. Yes, the plot was completely predictable. But dammit, it had what mattered: snappy one-liners, dudes in humm-vees, and dinosaurs running around and eating people. The mass public are suckers for Paleolithic carnage, and we can never see enough people get munched by mildly irritated T-Rexes, because that's entertainment. This Jurassic fixation was undoubtedly what prompted the survival horror masters at Capcom to leave the Resident Evil universe for a bit, and try out a new excursion into terror. The result was the mildly successful Playstation game Dino Crisis, and now the same title has thundered its way onto the Sega Dreamcast.  I played through the majority of Dino Crisis last year on the PSX, and I enjoyed what I saw -- the full 3D environments were solid, the gameplay was very RE2-ish, and the overall experience felt like a testing ground for Code Veronica. In short, it didn't suck. So when Capcom announced that they would be porting Dino Crisis to the Dreamcast, I grinned in anticipation: with a few graphical tweaks and a frame-rate boost, a tweaked DC version should have been able to hold its ground with the DC's top adventure games.  Here be the setup: a group of rough-and-ready soldiers is dispatched to an exotic island laboratory, ordered to investigate the shady goings-on of some potentially deadly egghead. The team winds up finding a decimated security force, and evidence that some very large -- and very hungry -- animals are prowling the area in search of raw meat. You step into the thigh-high combat boots of Regina, a foxy red-headed uber-babe whose mission is to cut to the thick of it, infiltrate the research facility, and discover the true source of the dinosaur scourge. We reckon you've got a loooong night ahead of you. Dino Crisis follows the rules of the survival horror genre to a T. Throughout most of the game, you're wandering through abandoned industrial areas, finding keys, unlocking doors, and solving puzzles most frequently involving switches or buttons. Naturally, there are scares aplenty: if you walk into an empty room with a key sitting on a desk, you can bet the farm on a velociraptor dropping from the ceiling and mauling your ass. See a hallway with lots of glass windows? Get ready for a horde of raptors crashing in uninvited. And these dinos are a bit more formidable than your average zombie - your standard raptor moves quicker and takes more hits than a shuffling undead brain-sucker. And you'd better like 'em, since they're the most common enemy you'll face (encounters with other creatures - like the tiny compys - are strangely limited). And in the fine, established Capcom tradition, there's a major shortage of ammunition (though ~Ammo-mixing~ provides interesting results), and the inventory system is a bit crap - hope you enjoy fiddling around with the futuristic equivalent to those other-dimension storage boxes.  On the other hand, the free-roaming 3D camera sets the game apart from the first two RE titles.  Instead of pre-rendered backdrops, Dino Crisis features cameras that move, track, and pan with your every movement. While they're not quite as suspenseful as the ones used in Veronica,  they do a good job at framing the action - and keeping dinos off-screen, unfortunately. There are few things I despise more than entering a room, hearing the clicking of raptor toes on floor tiles, and not seeing anything that's in front of me.  And this brings us to the game's biggest flaw - the visuals. As we all know, Dino Crisis was released on the PSX over a year ago, and straight ports from 32-bit to 128-bit systems are going to be bunk if they're denied the love and attention they deserve. Capcom has spared no effort in bringing us a carbon copy of the Playstation version, complete with low-resolution textures, low-polygon models, and cheeseball animation intact. Not only that, but they've also given us lovely amounts of psychedelic - and most definitely un-Dreamcast-like - texture warping, leading us to believe that Regina loaded up on 'ludes before boarding the attack chopper. Considering that the DC supports perspective-corrected texture mapping by default, we can only deduce that somebody at Capcom has no clue as to what they're doing, and should read up on the Katana development docs.  There's also a stunning lack of extras. Capcom's other quick-and-dirty Dreamcast port, Resident Evil 2: Value Plus Edition, featured the game's secret, unlockable missions playable from the start. Dino Crisis does not offer the same courtesy, forcing the player to pound through the game with a respectable score before unlocking the arcade-style Operation Wipeout mission. Analog control is unsupported, and the only noteworthy addition is the VMU status screen, which tells you your current weapon, ammo, and health.   Musically speaking, the game is a bit of a mess -- the laid-back pianos of the RE series have been dumped in favor of bejoobled strings that obnoxiously jet across the upper register at the slightest provocation. Audio is sub-par as well, drawing from the same sound libraries that you've heard a thousand times before. And the voice acting? There are some really stupid one-liners in there, but it's not up to the cheeseball level of the original RE (which I'm starting to miss, actually).  So is the game worth a $70 import? Considering you can get the exact same experience with a cheap, used copy of the PSX Dino Crisis and a copy of Bleem, I believe the answer to that is a resounding ~Hell no.~ Adding further insult to injury is the fact that Dino Crisis 2 just launched in Japan - and if Capcom wanted to shovel a half-ass PSX port down our throats, we would have been much more receptive of the sequel. Hopefully, the Japanese gaming public will show some self-respect, and ignore this carelessly-ported, unneeded chunk of gaming earwax. The game is fine; the presentation is appalling. Shame on you, Capcom.  -- Colin ~Too Sleepy to Think of a Clever Tagline~ Williamson, IGN DC", "date": "Sep 14, 2000"}
