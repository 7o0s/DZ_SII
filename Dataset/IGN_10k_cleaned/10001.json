Sowing seeds, tilling soil, milking cows -- it all sounds more like tedious work than engaging play, and yet somehow all of these activities come together to create an experience that doesn't feel at all like a chore. The game is Harvest Moon, and its concept of casting players as a young and unproven son trying to reclaim his father's farm was so well received 11 years ago that it went on to become the foundation for one of the gaming industry's longest-lasting and consistently entertaining franchises. Who could have guessed?   Jack is your character's name by default (though you can change it to whatever you want) and your adventure in Harvest Moon begins when your parents leave you, abandoned, alone at home on the family farm. The old farmhouse, chicken coop and surrounding fields have fallen into disrepair and it's up to you to restore them to pristine productivity in the span of two and a half years. At the end of that time (which is just 300 days by the game's internal calendar) your father reappears on the scene and assesses your work, either praising you for your diligence or admonishing you for being too lazy.   Harvest Moon's 16-bit visuals are still gorgeous today. So Harvest Moon is an RPG/ simulation that plays out in a specific amount of time, and the way you choose to budget that time is where the core gameplay gets going. You can choose to focus on growing crops, working the land to produce bountiful harvests of turnips, potatoes, corn and the like. Or you can choose to center your efforts on livestock, raising a coop full of healthy chickens and a stable of milk-producing cattle. Or you can choose to just blow it all off and spend all your time exploring the mountainous countryside, fishing and taking trips to the spa. It's up to you.   The most successful strategy is likely a balanced combination of each of the above, but it will probably take you a while to find your rhythm -- Harvest Moon limits your total play time to 300 days, but then each individual day is also limited to a set portion of time as well. Jack can stay up as late as he wants plucking weeds and moving fenceposts around, but more physically-demanding activities like chopping up old tree stumps with the axe or pulverizing loose rocks with the hammer become impossible when the day's drawn on too long and he's too drained of energy.    It can be frustrating to see Jack get tired and the sun go down as quickly as it does each day, and new players may get turned off by the fact that this sim is so accurate in that regard. It's hard work to be a farmer, and it always does seem like you never have enough hours in the day. But with persistence you'll persevere, and you'll learn how to schedule Jack's time and energy well after the first week or so as you're also learning what it takes to successfully raise a healthy crop. Harvest Moon's planting and reaping aren't as simple as, say, Animal Crossing. Here you'll have to clear the land, and then use a hoe to prepare the earth, then sow the seed into the ground, then water the freshly-planted seed with the watering can. And that's just for starters. You'll also have to remember to re-water the plants each day and wait for several days to go by before your efforts bear any fruit (or rather, vegetables).    It can sound again like tedious work in laying out the formula one step at a time like that, but again Harvest Moon feels more rewarding than its individual components would suggest. You'll find yourself getting into a consistent rhythm after a while, and it's at that point that more of the game will open up to you -- you can find the free time to explore more of the game world and even catch the eye of some of the nearby village's local single girls. One of Harvest Moon's signature sidequests (and an element that has gone on to be an important part of the entire franchise) is that you can win the heart of any of several different eligible bachelorettes in town, and ultimately get married and have a family. Whether you choose to pursue that goal can also have an effect on the ending you earn after the two and a half years are finished, as there are multiple different ones you can potentially achieve.Harvest Moon was a weird but well-envisioned game when it first came to the SNES in 1997, and those who had the chance to play the original were probably not too surprised to see so many sequels and spin-offs in the decade since. What makes the game especially compelling in the end is its simplicity and value. Also, because this is the first Harvest Moon game, it's more accessible than some of the most recent and more complicated franchise installments. In short, give Harvest Moon a shot. It's a great role-playing experience and great sim rolled into one, and there's a reason why it kicked off a full franchise that's still releasing new installments on nearly every platform today -- farming is fun.", "date": "Feb 11, 2008"}
