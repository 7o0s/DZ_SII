So, when I peeked the puzzler 1000 Words on the Sprint game deck this weekend, I was more than curious. Is the good ship GL able to steer safely through the rough seas of mobile brainteasers? Naturally, the answer is ~yes.~ It seems Gameloft is incapable of making a tanker, and 1000 Words is please puzzler fans much in the same way Prince of Persia raises the pulse of swashbuckling adventure junkies.   1000 Words is essentially a take on Scrabble, where you must glean how many words you can create from a  six-letter rack. You must crate three-, four-, five-, and sometimes six-letter words to juice your score and earn bonuses. Every rounds has a set of requirements, such as finding at least six of the possible X number of words that can be created. (That's actually one of my favorite features in 1000 Words, that it tells you how many words can be created from each rank. It gives you a frame of reference as you frantically assemble the letters.)   There is a time limit in each round, but you can score a bonus that adds precious seconds to it. Every successful word created adds to the green bonus meter on the left side of the screen. When it fills, you get a bonus -- such as added time, or rearranging the letters in your rack, which helps spur thought. If you try to enter is word that doesn't exist, such as ~trextl,~ a red meter on the right starts to fill. If the red meter fills, you get some sort of setback. For example, the letter tiles will be temporarily covered, leaving you to look at blank tiles, trying to remember which letter is where.   The game is simple to pick-up and dig into. The quick game mode gives you a nice tutorial, and then turns you loose on some easy puzzles. The story mode is kinda goofy, in that you must defeat word masters and whatnot, and it blends some elements from Greek mythology into the whole ordeal. However, the story mode offers some fun, fiendish puzzles, so just roll with the text and whatnot. Finally, there is an online mode. You try to challenge the top score of the day, and if you do, you're name is posted for all to revel at. That's kinda slick, even if it's not as cool as a head-to-head challenge might have been.   The system for entering words is easy. You just click on each letter, then choose enter to submit your word. You can use a status option to check your progress. There is a clear button that wipes whatever word you were working on, should you make a boo-boo.   I downloaded 1000 Words on to a simple Sanyo 8200, so needless to say, I didn't get an eye-bleeding experience. However, clever packaging is not essential for a puzzle game -- what matters in a word teaser like this is whether or not you can quickly read and easily identify the letters. You can. The Greek-inspired stage and score are just gravy. The story cutscenes look reasonable, but I've seen screens of 1000 Words on a higher-end handset that definitely have a lot more detail.  One of my favorite things about mobile is that it's, well, mobile. And 1000 Words is the kind of game you can appreciate anywhere and at anytime. I played a few rounds between painting a bathroom and while watching over my dog napping in the ivy in the backyard. You can easily click in and out of the game and get a good little puzzle session. If you like word puzzlers, 1000 Words is an excellent download. However, if you're an action gamer drawn by the Gameloft pedigree, be warned that while 1000 Words can feel as frantic as a Splinter Cell action scene, it's a different kind of game from the firm with the Midas touch.", "date": "Aug 23, 2005"}
