Along with star-studded designer Core, it created one of the most popular game characters of all time in less than three years. Lara Croft is one of the icons of PlayStation lore, along with Sonic, Mario, and Crash. But, despite its great marketing efforts, Eidos has this one big hang up that won't go away. With the exception of Tomb Raider, Eidos likes to dumb things down to sub-dumb levels.    Let's take Fighting Force 2. The first Fighting Force was a simple beat-em-up, with a tad of hackneyed charm. It was action-packed, one to two player, and it sort of brought back the good 'ol days of Final Fight and Strider to the console. I know, I'm being way too nice, but you get the point.   So here comes Fighting Force 2, which Eidos and Core told us has drastically changed. FF2 was supposed to be a single-player game packed with stealthy objectives and spy-like qualities, using a new engine with gorgeous new graphics and technical effects. The emphasis wasn't supposed to be on simple action, it was on the same hard-core qualities that gamers liked in Tenchu, Metal Gear Solid, and Syphon Filter. Well, guess what? Core must not have had the development time it needed, or something, because despite what Eidos said, Fighting Force 2 is so tired and repetitive, so mind numbing and simplistic that it's a sham. FF2 is basically a better looking Fighting Force, except with one player.  Gameplay I don't like slamming games for the fun of it, and I have a lot of respect for developers who spend a good portion of two-plus years creating a single game. That takes dedication, focus, and a lot of hard work. But when the game is so different than what you've been told it was going to be, you feel cheated. And, you will feel cheated if you pick this up.   In FF2, you are Hawk Mason, back from the first game, far slimmer and more brutal than ever. You're a bad-@ss mercenary. How can I tell? It's easy. Hawk holds his gun sideways. (Tip o' the hat, John Woo.) In each level, Hawk reads through his directives, and then must walk, climb, blast and bash his way through large, interior levels to meet the objectives. Oftentimes the objectives change mid-mission. But it doesn't matter, because no matter what you throw at Hawk, the real mission is to smash the buttons as often and as hard as possible. He likes action. You like action! He likes guns. You like guns! He's dumb. So are you if you buy this game.   What is cool, however, is how much stuff can blow up. Ninety-nine percent of the objects are totally destructible. Big objects usually require a grenade or missile launcher, but most everything is ready to burst into flames with a few punches. That's right, kids!  Stuff that doesn't normally blow up now does! Desks burst into flames! Woo-hoo! File cabinets churn out a dozen of so files after a few kicks, and then they burst into flames! Boxes! Boom! Crates! Boom! Computers! Boom! Desks! Boom! Door switches! Burst into flames! Oh, and watch out for those flammable barrels! They go boom too, and they hurt! Ow! Oh yeah, karate kick a chair, and BOOM! Then kick it again and watch it spin around!   Beneath the flimsy sheath of stealthy descriptions and spy-like veneer is a lame-brain, button-mashing game -- just like the first one. It's Eidos' old trick. Add more enemies, more fighting, more action. Then dumb it down and blow it up. Remember Ninja? This is kind of like a good-looking Ninja, except you're bad-boy Hawk Mason, loaded up like the A-Team with weapons and destructive goods. You can even punch giant pipes and computers with your bare hands! And Boom! Everything goes up in flames! Boom! Boom! Boom!   Everything about this gameplay is silly. From the game design to the hilariously dumb enemies, who, regardless of their size, are easy to cream, to the objectives, which are simply more reasons to beat up on bad guys who hide out in dark corners, waiting for you clobber them with a few punches. Boom! Hey! Why don't they explode?   Character control is mixed. Hawk spins slowly around, just like our favorite videogame pinup girl, Ms. Croft. He slowly turns around after a few hits and also takes cheap shots from enemies, who bash in his shins, as Hawk climbs down ladders. One of the more idiotic things Hawk is capable of is changing weapons. Switching from one to the other is actually clever and efficient (press down Triangle and scroll through your inventory), but once a weapon is out of ammo, Hawk goes macho. He simply chucks it away, like an old sandwich or a bad piece of fruit. Fling! I'm a little surprised that once it hits the ground it doesn't blow up. BOOM! Oh well, one more lost opportunity.   Graphics The best thing about the game is its look, with several exceptions. Whether outside of inside, the Fighting Force 2 engine is almost a substantial piece of work. It looks like Core revamped the latest Tomb Raider engine and sped things up a bit. It's not like the game is gorgeous, but two things work well. The lighting is solid. Just like everything that blows up and goes Boom (!), nearly everything sizzles with light and particles. The panels of the doors crackle with light, the grenades, which actually bounce and roll like in real life, explode with a nice dome shaped fireball explosion, and occasionally after blowing out a fuse box, everything crackles with energy. It's cool looking. The game is filled with contrasting light and dark areas, changing the mood of each level with a moderate amount of success. There are lots of blues, reds and black. But unfortunately, just like Tomb Raider III, Fighting Force 2 is way too dark for its own good.   The camera does a few interesting things, too. In the small rooms, it zips around, moving up and down in the third-person perspective as it follows Hawk. It looks like Core needed about three or four more weeks to perfect it, but didn't get the time. Occasionally, you find that you don't know where you are: Small crevices and little inlets are the cause, and I'm not entirely sure why Core built these problems into the game. But, for the most part, the camera still pans around, trying to find the right spot for you to see and fight. It's pretty quick and capable.   One last little chuckle. Hawk can attack enemies from several different floor levels. By aiming up, he can shoot or throw grenades. In one area I encountered a baddie who did something very strange. He had grenades in his hands and he was trying to blow me up (Boom!). Well, he waved at me after he threw one. It almost looked he was saying ~Hi Hawk! What's up, bro?~ But it also looked like he was shaking his fist at me, as if to say, ~Damn you Hawk Mason! I'll get you yet!~ Needless to say, the enemy animation and AI are pathetic.   Sound Another great part of Fighting Force 2 is its sound effects. Everything that blows up goes Boom! And sounds just like that, too. On the opposite side of things, Hawk and his opponents all sound ludicrously primitive, as their only response to any encounter goes like this, ~Arrgh!~ ~Ohhfff!~ and ~Uhhnnn!~ Sounds like a bunch of Neanderthals. Not that games should be the pinnacle of culture, mind you, but hey, a little variety in sound does make a difference.   The atmospheric and moody music and is nice. Overall, the sense of doom is always around the corner and the eerie collages of sound successfully work that particular advantage. It reminded me of Doom 64, but didn't scare me as much.I take that whole thing back about not liking to slam games. On rare occasions I do. I had fun slamming Ninja back in the day, and Fighting Force 2 provided a good laugh, too. I admire Core's attempt to change the format to a more intelligent one, or at least a slightly more intelligent one, but this didn't even get that far. It's like they took an old, tired genre and made a bad game even worse. The original Fighting Force wasn't great, but it seemed like a Final Fight type game, which was its attraction. This one seems like a bad mutation that couldn't shake its Final Fight clothes, but wants to be something more, like Metal Gear Solid. It's half way between both, and fails in both categories. And everything goes Boom a lot.", "date": "Dec 23, 1999"}
