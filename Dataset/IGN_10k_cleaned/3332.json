{"name": "Point Blank", "name_review": "Point Blank", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/04/13/point-blank-4", "text": "While Namco's other light-gun shooter, Time Crisis 2, may be eating up the darling critics' award for coolest graphics and great game design, etc., etc., it's Namco old-school light gun game, Point Blank, that's really where it's at.  In fact, the reason that Point Blank is so cool is that it's incredibly fast paced, moving from event to event with little load time and little other crap in the way to keep you from shooting at the silliest stuff you've ever seen. And for all of this 'old-school' talk, Point Blank -- which started as a coin-op more than four years ago -- is a testament to great game design and an important title for game companies that made the likes of Judge Dredd to pay attention to. (Note: For those of you who haven't already purchased a light-gun peripheral, here's your reason to buy one.)  The graphics aren't that great, but they aren't the point here. And as the old adage says, ~It's the gameplay, dummy.~ The flat-sprite graphics, which are appropriate to the game, add the necessary humor and zip that help to make the game that much more fun.  Essentially, Point Blank is an arcade gallery shooter, consisting of dozens of little events and contests from which you earn points to continue on, or vie against a second player for bragging rights. Players can simply pick up the second controller and start in the competition at any point in between games and start a rollicking good contest. The myriad of games have a huge scope, ranging from single-shot contests in which a little leaf must be hit the first time, to saving a character from arching piranhas which leap from three layer water waves, like those seen in Broadway plays, to target ranges, full-blown blast fests in which you must hit as many animals as possible, pop-up bad guys in hallways and evil looking alley-ways.  In the end, Point Blank doesn't have any pretension. It's quick, dirty shooting, that is simple and fun. When you get through the varying difficulty levels, then you can go back repeatedly with friends and family. Make sure to bring your annoying sister or younger brother in a few spells, and you'll get a real thrill, by giving them a real licking. For those of you who haven't already got the point -- go buy this game, it's a great addition to your PlayStation shooting collection.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Apr 13, 1998"}
