The Contra series has always been known for its difficulty, a near-maddening level of challenge that meant only the best and most practiced of gamers could find success in their play  unless you cheated, of course. The famous Up-Up-Down-Down Konami Code granted players 30 lives in the first Contra title on the NES, allowing everyone significant room for error throughout the side-scrolling, gun-blazing adventure. But the code won't help you here. This SNES sequel removed the classic cheat, meaning there's no easy way out of this game's challenge factor. Contra III: The Alien Wars is tough, and you'll have to play the old-fashioned way.   The Alien Wars was the fourth Contra game to come to the States, after Contra and Super C on the NES and Operation C on the Game Boy. It was April of 1992 by the time Contra III was ready to roll out here in America, and it did so as the first installment of the series to be built from the ground up with a home console in mind. (The previous games had been ports of arcade hits.) The power of the Super Nintendo allowed for greater graphics, enhanced sound and unique new spins on the classic run-and-gun gameplay that was the series' signature style.   Two of those new spins came in literal form  the second and fifth levels of Contra III combine an overhead perspective with a Mode 7-powered spinning playfield. You  or you and a friend simultaneously  must run through the ruined environments of a futuristic Earth, hunting down and destroying enemy-generating checkpoints. The L and R trigger buttons rotate the landscape both clockwise and counter, and after searching through and scouring the revolving levels you'll find yourself in a similarly gyratory boss fight.   The rest of the game is more traditional, presented in the same side-scrolling shoot-'em-up style that formed the foundation of the franchise in the late '80s. You'll run, jump and blast your way through waves of alien enemies, collecting power-ups along the way. The grabbable gun upgrades include the classic spreader rifle, heat-seeking homing missiles, laser cannons and more. Unique to Contra III is the ability to hold two different guns at once and switch between them on the fly, as well as the addition of screen-clearing bombs that can be activated when you really get pinned up against a wall.   Contra III is arguably the best installment in the Contra series, as it polished the gameplay of the earlier titles and kicked up the action energy even higher than before. Its only drawback is its length  The Alien Wars only lasts for six levels, which is not a deep experience by any stretch of logic. You'll likely have a blast playing this one, as so many gamers did back in 1992, but it won't keep you satisfied for long. Harder difficulty settings and the ability to adjust the starting number of lives (maximum of seven) help to offset the short scope a bit.  Contra III proves that priorities have shifted in the industry over the past 15 years  for a new title to ship with only six levels today would be laughable. But the six levels that are here are jam-packed, focused and a lot of fun, especially when played together with a friend. They're also tough as nails, especially on the more extreme difficulty settings, so getting through to the end may take a lot of trial, error and repetition of the same half-dozen stages. If you don't mind a shorter shooter and aren't frustrated by a true challenge, cash in your Wii Points  800 will get you a ticket to a war-torn tomorrow. (But not 30 lives when you get there.)", "date": "Jan 30, 2007"}
