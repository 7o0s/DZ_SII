The original game was a Shockwave-based minor phenom, and if its original audience is still interested in soaking the poor pedestrians of this digital metropolis, they will likely find similar pleasures in Water Balloon Drop.   The game is an easy pick-up. Your mischievous water balloon lobber is perched on top of a series of buildings, charged with raining down inconvenience on the unlucky sidewalk denizens. Cellphone gabbers, businessmen, automobiles, and skateboarding punks are all fair game. You need to avoid splashing police officers and grandmas, though, as this will negatively affect your score.   While the poor folk on the ground cannot necessarily return fire, you must be wary of hazards in the air. Birds, for example, will swoop from side-to-side and try to nail your in-game avatar.   And, really, that pretty much sums it up for Water Balloon Drop. The game is not particularly deep, and while I enjoyed it for a while, I must confess that the action grew a little rote. This is a game best played in quick doses, and if offered via subscription, rented for a month before the big deletion.   The game is bright and colorful, and the different locales certainly have individual flavor. The audio is pretty solid, too. For example, if you soak a grandma, they will cry out, ~You bum!~ You bum, indeed.  Water Balloon Drop is a total bite-sized game. It lacks the kind of depth that will keep you coming back, but it's good enough for a few gaming sessions. After a while, I got a little bored dropping balloons on people, screen after screen. There are better simple pleasures on the decks, but if you have fond memories of the original, there's likely no reason you won't enjoy the mobile Water Balloon Drop.", "date": "Sep 1, 2005"}
