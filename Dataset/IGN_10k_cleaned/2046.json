It's not even a very good GBA title, as this mini-game compilation/board game hybrid is extremely misbalanced. The board game is way too long, and the mini-games are way too short and simple. It's as if the title was originally intended as a Game Boy Color game, and moved to the Game Boy Advance at the last minute. Features 16 minigames 18 different items to use during the board game Link cable support for four players (requires cartridge per system) Only for Game Boy Advance  It's a simple story for a simple game -- Tweety stumbles upon a box in the forest and opens it, unleashing dark magic that begins to slowly turn the tweetybird into stone. The task for the game players is to traverse the entire world, grabbing five different colored gems that, when combined, will stop and reverse the stone process on the poor bird. But even though Tweety's life is at stake, the other Looney Tunes characters have made a game out of this adventure -- the first person back with the five gems wins.  Tweety & the Magic Gems is laid out like a simple board game like Sorry or Uncle Wiggly, with players drawing cards that will advance them around the board one space at a time. The board is the entire world map, and the required gems are scattered within city sub-boards. You'll have to wander this massive board to find all five gems, which will literally take players a couple hours to do in optimal circumstances...  Unfortunately, there are way too many penalties hidden in the game that make the game's overall required task an absolute chore. Randomly throughout the game players will have their gems stolen...for good. So if, say, you spent a few turns trying to secure the green gem only to have it stolen by a random event (or by another player), you have to spend another few turns heading back to the same location to grab the gem again. It's unbelievably irritating when this happens, since the game board is incredibly huge...too much for its own good.  If a player lands on a red square, it could open up one of 16 different mini-games that are incredibly basic and most require nothing more than a super fast finger on the A button -- carve a totem, knock down brick or ice walls, launch a rocket. climb a tree...all these tasks are simple rapid-fire challenges. Some mini-games, like Bigger/Smaller (a high-low guessing game) or Guess the Color, are just baffling to find in this cartridge, since they require no technique or challenge...it's a random event. None of these games take advantage of the system hardware, and everything, from the game design to the graphics, could have been done on the Game Boy Color. And that's no exaggeration.  Worse, once you enter a game, there's no way out. If you need to break for lunch, you'll have to keep the system on -- there's no battery save in this game, and this is inexcusable for a title that requires so much playtime investment on a handheld system. On a console, it's a bit more acceptable - but when you're on the move and have more distractions at hand, having the ability to stop the game is almost a necessity.   The only real Game Boy Advance feature is its four player support -- and when you look at the basic graphics and simple minigames, it's a wonder why this game doesn't feature single cartridge link play. It certainly would have worked to the game's favor if it didn't require the purchase of four copies of Tweety to take advantage of the multiplayer features. Playing this game in single player mode definitely doesn't make me want to pitch the sale of another copy to my friends, that's for sure. Infinitely better GBA titles such as Bomberman Tournament and Chu-Chu Rocket offer much more elaborate gameplay, yet these games feature the downloadable link option. While Tweety & the Magic Gems isn't the worst game in the GBA's line-up, it's definitely among the bottom of the barrel. The board game is annoyingly long, and the mini-games are surprisingly short. There's no real balance in the game design...it's just all bad.", "date": "Jul 30, 2001"}
