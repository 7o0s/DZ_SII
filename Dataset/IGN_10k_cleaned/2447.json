{"name": "Demon World: Dark Armies", "name_review": "Demon World", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/29/demon-world", "text": "~They actually have the gall to charge forty dollars for this game?~ Get used to hearing that, because if you purchase Demon World it's what you will be shouting, yelling, saying, and muttering day and night (other, more explicit forms of vocabulary aside).   Demon World is Xicat's quick localization of a German RTS based off of, you guessed it, the Demon World miniature role-playing game! When I say quick localization, I mean it appears as if Earl in janitorial got stuck with picking it apart and putting it back together again in just a week's time. Not only do all of the cutscenes and art still refer to the game as ~Demonworld II: Dunkle Armeen~ (it's a sequel over there), but a noticeable and unwelcome amount of the in-game text is still German, and those parts that aren't are translated inconsistently.  What's worse is the complete and utterly baffling lack of any form of helpful instruction whatsoever. No manual, no electronic documentation, and no tutorial (at least not one of any worth) round out a completely production value devoid forty dollar package. This type of startling player neglect wouldn't even fly in a budget title, let alone a full-priced one. Technically a tutorial does exist -- there's a button in the main menu labeled ~Tutorial~ that you press and it takes you to a portion of the game with missions that are supposed to be instructional. But, if you want to get technical, then I can just as easily argue that for something to be fairly classified as a tutorial it must in some way tutor, and not ~make a da person stupider while a givin' him da brain anger.~   Without any relevant instruction of any kind, the tutorial amounts to a free practice muddle session where you can order your units to do different things and experiment with them in various ways, trying all the while to come to grips with even the most basic of actions. Instead of actually telling you how to accomplish the tasks set before you, you're merely told to do them, and that's that. Inconsistent and misleading syntax only serve to amplify the problem. Imagine telling a child to drive to point B, not ever teaching him or her how to drive, and then not even having a point B, but points 1-5 instead. It's just insane!    Still, I'll be the first to admit that even the most novice of us can, after time, acclimate to and master a game starting with no information at all. But, that requires two things: the game at hand must first be enjoyable, and it must, second, have some kind of a logic driven GUI or OOUI with actions that can be accomplished in similar ways to titles before it. The extra digital comic that comes with Demon World is still in German, and its text is too damn hard to read anyway, so do you really think the interface is going to shine like the brightest star or even just be familiar and workable? Yeah, keep kidding yourself.  Demon World is an easy contender for what is quite possibly the most horrid interface I've yet to see in an RTS. Not only is it unresponsive, backwards, and twitchy, but nothing is clearly defined, and what little information is poorly displayed is usually uninformative.   Mouse clicking, something real-time strategies generally use in abundance, is so sloppy that a majority of the actions to be done will almost come off as a random affair. Sometimes when you click a character one thing will happen, and then at other times an entirely different thing will happen. I still, for the life of me, can't get the magical sub-command box to display on cue. I figured, through extensive trail and error, that right-clicking a unit without actually selecting them first would open up the actions box, but that doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes it will, sometimes it'll do nothing, and other times it'll cycle between the generic actions like march, run, and set fire to stuff. If you like needlessly aggravating yourself to enraging levels that would make English white van drivers blush then go ~play~ some Demon World, the game that guarantees to throb them head veins up real good.   Mouse movement is incremental. You know how in ~normal~ RTS games when you push the mouse to the side of the screen the map will scroll in that direction until you move the mouse somewhere else? Not going to happen here. Pushing and leaving the mouse at one edge of the display only causes a very short predetermined movement to that direction. It's cool how the cursor will also often become stuck on the bottom of the screen as if it were being held back by some kind of an invisible barrier. You can try and move it, but it'll drag and squirm a bit before it breaks free. Who needs smooth, flowing movement anyway?   And yet here are still more annoyances... Once an order is given, you must actually reselect a unit or group to have them perform an additional action (picture having to re-click a tank in C&C after every time you've told it to do anything). Dragging and dropping the selecting box on two or more units at a time will pair them together like normal, but they'll remain grouped even if you try and select one of those units individually at a later time. The grabbing of all these units is also way off. It either requires precise placement directly above said unit, or even moving a full inch to an inch and a half below it and clicking on invisible space to grab them.  Did I mention you also can't deselect anything...ever? You actually have to first complete an order to be able to select another unit or group of units with the mouse. I suppose technically you could somehow be able to, but hell if I know what it is. Let me just check the manual here. Well, that didn't so much work (no manual and all). Hey, why not check online? Ah, too bad the developer's site is only in German, and Xicat's fluff piece is just a tad less than helpful...  ~Planned attacks + planned missions + stunning visual = Flight sim drama of immeasurable proportions.~  Hmmm... I can see five major problems with that last sentence (and yes it is really from the official site). Better just flex my transatlantic German understanding psychic powers here and read the Bavarian beer soaked minds of the lederhosen clad that came up with this one.  It's as if whoever designed the interface to this stupid, stupid game didn't even take introductory classes in any kind of generic interface design. They so totally don't know what the hell they're doing that it boggles the mind. I'd wager Tori Spelling could do better, and she barely qualifies as sentient.  And why the hell are the menus and game so choppy? It's not like the darn thing is doing anything that would bring a Pentium 4, GeForce 3 Ti 500, and 384MB of RAM down. Ooh, drawing all 256 of those colors must be real taxing. And moving that mouse cursor around, all the time having to correspond with the hand of the player? You got to be lame if you actually think you're going to be getting both of those ~additional features~ to work well simultaneously.  Unfortunately, eventually coming to grips with the interface only means you'll have to then contend with the substandard game that lay below it.  In a nutshell, Demon World is a no resource, formation and attribute driven RTS that provides an in-game pause feature, retaining the ability to command and control (Baldur's style).   Oh yeah, you can set formations, space your units, force their direction, and plan out your strategies from the get go, but it's not going to matter any. The only thing you have to do to attain success is keep your units who are capable of ranged attacks the hell away from everyone else. Even something as simple as this morphs into a chore because as soon as any of your army engage an enemy they aren't going to do a damn thing they're ordered to unless you get lucky (which you won't). The best you can hope for is that they either win on their own, or get scared and flee with a white flag waving high above their head, as they seem decidedly unresponsive and uncooperative when in battle.  In the game's defense, this next complaint will kind of negate the purpose of the last (it's a good thing when one big problem makes a smaller one before it less prevalent, right?). Combat immediately gets so jumbled and hectic that there becomes no easy way of acceptably controlling your units if they haven't already been assigned to keyboard numbered groups (from which they can apparently never be de-assigned without more groups being added). Discerning who's who in a writhing blob of clipping and crowded activity is trouble enough (especially since info windows pop up all the freaking time and further obstruct vision), but wrestling down the crippled interface to actually get your armies to do something is downright maddening, and worse still because even when you do at last gain control of someone, chances are they'll disobey whatever order you dish down, just like I said before.   The single-player campaign of noble Jason Klingor against the foul orc horde is strung together by little cutscenes and the narrator, Prince Klingor himself, is done fairly well, at least passably so. Leading a grand army that's the last hope for salvation from evil, and being able to choose which course you next take, and with what units and special items, before actually initiating a battle are all nice touches, but fail to save the already failing game.   I won't even pretend to know how the fog of war works. Sometimes it's like a traditional RTS where when you move to an area it becomes revealed, but when your character leaves said area the vicinity behind gets lightly grayed out and the units in it become invisible. Then at other times, it will become lightly grayed and the units will remain visible, and sometimes it will do neither and just blacken entirely, like you've never traversed that land to begin with. Okay.  A myriad of options are presented to liven up the combat, right down to ordering your units to take refuge in homes whose roofs become transparent, revealing a nice bit of detail therein. Sadly, like everything else Demon World, hell if I know what good this is for. A house can only hold one or two units, assuming they can get through the door (most are content with bouncing into one another and twitching like crazy), and the enemy ~AI,~ if it's not too busy standing there doing nothing or blindly rushing at you in waves, will just attack you regardless.   I don't know whom good Klingor enlisted to serve his nation, but your army sure is stupid. Groups almost always need a reassurance click to get them to do anything and often times they'll take a round about way to get that thing done. Order them to attack someone and instead of going to that unit, they'll sometimes walk in a big circle, go where that unit last was, and then follow them until they meet. Or, they just plain walk the other way and then stand in a stupor.   Demon World's strict reliance on combat and a complete lack of resource gathering don't work in this case because the combat is so poorly implemented. Heroes and other units (most come in groups) with experience, attributes, levels, and special assignable items are all great inclusions, but naturally amount to nothing when built atop a cracked interface and mediocre battle system. There are a multitude of units that comprise the three races (Orc, Dwarf, Human), but most opposing units seem to serve the same purpose (the WarCraft II effect).  Speaking of, I swear this game looks like WarCraft with terrible banding, a borderline 256 color palette, rigid lifeless animations, and the sparsely thrown in particle effect and 3D lameness. There's nothing of worth or even of note. There can at times be a lot of characters on screen, but no more so than heavy battles in Starcraft (fleets of Protoss carriers come to mind). Rain, snow, wind, terrain that effects speed... Fine and dandy, but not quite candy.   No doubt coaxed by marshmallow peeps, many of the unit acknowledgements might very well be from the localization team. Aside from the tolerable Klingor, voices are redundant and never excel beyond average. The music feels like it came straight out of Castlevania, but was remixed in an unpleasant way. It works, but only in a laughable way.  In keeping with the exceedingly low production value set by the install/repair prompt that appears at auto-run even if you have successfully installed your game and then furthered by the complete lack of anything of substance, Demon World's online play doesn't even work. The server will never, ever acknowledge your request and initialize. That's okay though, considering no one is going to be wasting their time playing Demon World. I tried to get a LAN game started, but shouting out ~Wanna get in on some Demon World~ and then having to concede that the game is a ~Sorry ass RTS~ when questioned as to its nature doesn't usually bode too well when it comes to assembling a few players for a LAN party here at the office. I suppose I should have realized that my chances at getting a multiplayer game up were slim to none when the average passer-bye at my desk would stop only long enough to query, ~Why does it look like this game sucks so much?~   Masochists and mucho time wasters alike, go purchase this game right now. For the rest of us... 2001 was an exceptional year for strategy titles on the PC. In a majority of those games, every aspect of Demon World was done, but done right. No production value, no catering to the player, no interface, no substance, no purchase. Look to siege, command, and control elsewhere.    -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
