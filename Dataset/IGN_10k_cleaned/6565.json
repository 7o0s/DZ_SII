While it is the first of the King's Quest games to include elements of traditional role-playing games, it still holds true to its graphical adventure lineage.    In KQ:MOE, you assume the role of Connor, a simple but brave un-hero.  The storyline is fairly basic as storylines go, especially for fantasy adventure games.  While talking to a friend, an ominous storm begins to brew and  a strange piece of golden metal (a piece of the Mask of Eternity) comes crashing through the sky, landing at your feet.  You bend over to pick it up and, at the same time, a magical force encases all of the inhabitants of Daventry in stone.  Connor, still holding the piece of the fabled Mask of Eternity, is spared this petrification.  Connor has been chosen to save the world and free his people from their stone prisons (I guess it would make a pretty crappy game if you just happened to be one of the people who was turned into stone). To do this, you must travel through seven lands and recover the other four pieces of the Mask.  Reintegrate the pieces and the land of Daventry will return to normal, fail and your friends are doomed to be statues forever.    As I said before, KQ:MOE does include some elements of traditional role-playing (although real RPGers would laugh at this as Connor advances extremely fast ... I hit level 5 in under 20 minutes).  Connor advances in levels as you gain more experience through combat or quest fulfillment.  However, advancement only increases Connor's combat ability and the game still focuses on the elements that make the other games in the King's Quest series adventure style games: gathering items and figuring out where to use them.  While the combat and RPG elements may put-off some of the fans of the King's Quest series, it still plays like an old school graphic adventure.  Every object you come across will come in handy later in the game, and there are plenty of puzzles to master in KQ:MOE.  Plus, the combat system isn't difficult to master involving little more than continually clicking on the beast you wish to attack.  The rewarding parts of this game are deciphering its innovative brain teasers and figuring out what to do next to advance in each world.   The graphics in KQ:MOE, although rather dark and sparse at times, are really well done -- especially in 3Dfx mode.  You can play from either a third person or a first person view, switching between the two at will.  As with every third person perspective game, the default camera angle can sometimes cause major confusion and it will sometimes focus directly behind you, blocking your enemy and making combat nearly impossible.  However, by holding down your right mouse button and moving your mouse you can adjust the camera angle on the fly.  Although it may take a while to get used to constantly adjusting the camera angle, this feature really makes KQ:MOE extremely playable and it is a feature that every third person perspective game could use.  Another problem in many third person perspective games is that combat can become hectic because it is difficult to accurately land a blow on an opponent.  KQ:MOE solves this by allowing players to jump into Connor's eyes and get the perfect bead on the baddies.  As with every graphic adventure, KQ:MOE relies heavily on sound, and the audio team did a superb job of integrating the soundtrack as well as the sound effects into the game.  There is a dramatic, dynamic fantasy soundtrack that fits the settings perfectly and the environmental noises and sound effects are extremely well done, actually changing with surface characteristics and distance.  For example, the sound of your footsteps will change as you tread on different surfaces such as cobblestone paths, earthen trails, or grass.  The voice are recorded and mixed well too and the voice acting is actually pretty good, even if the dialog does sound a bit too much like a Renaissance Faire (too many 'tis' and 'zounds' in my opinion, but it does add flavor).  Of the few downsides to KQ:MOE, one of the biggest is the long load times between levels.  I suggest you use this time to go make a sandwich or throw a load of laundry in the wash.  Another downside is the use of too many jumping puzzles.  Since you can't control the distance of your jump or walk to the edge of a surface without falling off as in the Tomb Raider series, the jumping puzzles become really frustrating.  And this frustration is only compounded by the long wait as you load your game after dying.  I also got stuck in the environment a couple of times, but over the span of 50 hours of gameplay, this glitch isn't that bad.  If you can get over these slight flaws, then you're in for a real treat of a game.  Overall, KQ:MOE is a welcomed addition to the King's Quest series.  More traditional fans of the genre will probably scoff  at this one because of its combat system and the major graphical change from the relatively flat look of the rest of the series, but they're only going to miss a chance to play an entertaining game that really does continue the spirit in which the other games were created.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jan 9, 1999"}
