I purposely avoid the word sequel, because 2002 FIFA World Cup isn't really a follow-up as much as a sort of director's cut or an add-on chapter to last year's game. As the name suggests, EA's latest focuses squarely on the World Cup tournament which takes place in Japan and Korea from May 31 to June 30 of this year. Though FIFA 2002 featured a Road to the World Cup mode, players who wanted to take their favorite national team to victory were out of luck: qualification was as far as you could go. 2002 FIFA World Cup picks up where the old game left off and brings the excitement of the tournament home like no other game, but it's an upgrade and a downgrade at the same time.  The Facts  Official 2002 FIFA World Cup license, including accurate signage, mascots, music, and presentation Licensed players, uniforms, and teams Two modes: World Cup and Friendly Tournament Mode mirrors World Cup set up All the official Korean and Japanese stadiums New player-to-player animations near the ball Improved Air Play control system simplifies headers, volleys and aerial moves with one button Four levels of difficulty Star players Dynamic stadium/crowd effects, including streamers, confetti, and crowd chants Slow-motion victory and goal celebrations Four-player gameplay (both versus and co-op) Commentary by John Motson and Andy Gray Dolby Pro-Logic Surround sound Bonus content Requires 49 blocks on your Memory Card   Gameplay If you're into soccer, you've no doubt already read our review of the last game, so I won't bore you with too many control and gameplay details. To nobody's surprise, 2002 FIFA World Cup plays a lot like last year's game, but there are some key differences and enhancements that make the gameplay more solid all around. The game still uses directional passing (instead of the old search passes), you can add ballspin with the shoulder buttons, you still have to pump the turbo button to run faster, one-twos are performed via the C-Stick, and shot and pass strength is still determined by how long you hold down a button. But there are a few enhancements, some are mostly visual, others affect the overall feel of the game. But first things first: before you play this game, crank up the game speed to ~faster~ from the normal setting, then change the difficulty level from ~beginner~ to anything else. Unless you've never played a soccer videogame before, you'll end up beating teams 8:0 and higher on the default difficulty. There is virtually no opposition. Take the ball, tap the turbo, run straight to your opponent's goal, hold down a shoulder button to add ballspin and score a goal. This really shouldn't be the default setting. Luckily, there are three other difficulty levels where the opposing AI is a lot smarter -- and you can of course play as one of the lesser teams for an even bigger challenge. Speaking of which, the AI players and goalies still execute the occasional strange move, but it's a much more solid affair this time around. For example, the players will make a much more concerted effort to save the ball when it's on the line, and the goalies defend much more aggressively.  Players no longer just accidentally kick the ball out when it's on the line. They actually try their best to save it.     One of the gameplay enhancements EA has made over last year's game is a more intuitive airplay control system that makes for more realistic trapping and headers. Depending on the height at which the ball reaches the player, he uses the appropriate part of his body to play the ball. You can also determine the strength and direction of a header or bicycle kick while the ball is in the air. Fully powering up a header, for example, means you'll hit it far -- but the move becomes less accurate. If two players are fighting for an aerial pass, the player preparing for a less powerful volley is more likely to be successful. The developers have also made improvements to the players' special moves. In addition to step-overs and fake shots, you can also juggle the ball to really show off your skills. Using a juggling bar that appears on screen when you trigger a juggle (let go of the stick and press L or R to scoop the ball into the air), you can then effectively evade slide tackles by bringing the ball up to your chest or thigh, flick the ball over your opponent, or direct a badly executed pass into your own path. Another subtle, yet much appreciated improvement is better collision detection. The players in 2002 FIFA World Cup have a much more physical presence in that they block each other from getting to a pass, knock each other over, and even hit each other with the ball. You can now actually score an own goal by trying to clear the ball and have it bounce off the back of another player. The ball physics also appear a bit tighter, but like previous FIFA games World Cup still features the ~rubber band ball~ (the ball turns with the player -- the player doesn't kick the ball to turn) and there the are occasional shots that just wouldn't work in real life (like when a ball bounces off the post, only to be kicked by a player who is 5 feet away). While not 100% realistic, the player control feels great. You're not limited to eight-way movement as in most other soccer games (Virtua Striker, ISS), so you can run curves and move about just like a real football player.   Another returning feature from last year's version is the player run indicator. To set up for a better passing game in single-player matches your teammates will tell you when they're ready to make a run. All you have to do is press Z and face in the direction of the player in question to make him break away from the defense, then pass the ball. You can of course also combine this with one-twos to really outplay the defense. But asides from these two features, FIFA is still less of a ~team game~ than competing soccer titles. As a matter of fact, if anything, the focus seems to be more on individual talents since EA even added star players that are capable of outstanding feats of skill. Basically, all players are rated across a variety of categories like speed, shot, fitness, etc on a scale of 1-7, with 7 being the highest. The best players will have a 7 rating somewhere in their skill set. Brazil's world class defender Roberto Carlos gets a 7 in speed and his shooting ability, but you won't need to look up his numbers to know he's great. Streaks of light will appear on a player or on a kicked ball whenever he's exhibiting his perfect ~7~ skill. When you hit turbo with Roberto Carlos, you'll get a streak of yellow behind him indicating he's blazingly fast just in case you couldn't tell by all of the opponents getting lost in his dust. When a good shooter shoots, the ball will get a streak of light on it, travel extremely fast and will bend on its own to sneak inside a post even if you aren't putting ballspin on it. You get the same thing when a star passer makes a long enough pass. As you can imagine, the use of star players makes for some great moments (especially when playing against friends), but it would have been nice if EA could have paid equal attention to team play. You can set your formation before the match, adjust aggressiveness, and determine kick takers, but once the game starts any changes you want to make interrupt the flow of the game -- not to mention that they will be visible to the opposing player in multiplayer matches. World Cup 98 was the first EA soccer game to offer in-game formation control for more realistic team management (you could trigger offsite traps, instantly strengthen your defense when you're ahead, etc). The through runs are a great feature, but a full-fledged IGM system could help the make the new FIFA game a whole lot deeper. Another negative, and this one only applies to the GameCube version, is a lack of control over shot height when shooting at the goal. On Xbox and PS2, the analog buttons function is used to determine height of the shot (there are two pass buttons, so it's not really a problem with passing). On GameCube, the shot height is correlated to the shot strength. I'm sure a better solution could have been found somehow (such as holding turbo for a low shot and releasing it for a lob shot).   Do you own FIFA 2002? All in all, though, the play control and gameplay in 2002 World Cup is hardly shallow. You've got plenty of moves, good player control, and a challenging yet intelligent passing system, not to mention a great engine for multiplayer matches. But -- you knew this was coming -- there is one big problem with this game. Once you beat the World Cup with your favorite team, the play value drops considerably. Unlike FIFA 2002, World Cup only lets you play as the 32 qualified teams (plus unlockable European/African/American, etc ~All-Star~ teams) in the whole World Cup tournament or compete in a single friendly game -- that's it. No player or team creation, no challenge mode, no classic World Cup mode, no league play, no penalty shootout mode, no training. I realize that the game is supposed to be about the World Cup, but can you imagine a baseball game that just features the play-offs? A complete soccer package would be a game that lets you qualify for the World Cup, then compete in it. An even better one would let compete in the leagues, do player drafts and then build your own favorite World Cup team. Given the fact that EA has the basis for such a game -- and the fact that both ISS and Virtua Striker feature fleshed out ~story modes~ -- it's a major disappointment that the best playing game out of all three is so shallow in the features department. 2002 FIFA World Cup plays and looks better than FIFA 2002, but FIFA 2002 remains the better game.   Graphics Graphically, 2002 FIFA World Cup is a step above all the currently available console soccer games. Many of the players look a lot like their real-life counterparts, complete with small little details like differing hairstyles and facial hair. The mo-capped animations display a much wider range than ever before with players blocking each other from getting to the ball, raising their hands to indicate they're ready to receive a pass, and even getting their hands dirty to save a ball from going out. The game features all the official stadiums and they're reproduced with great attention to detail, down to shadows cast by the tribunes, cameramen that turn with the ball, and oversized mascots that give the game that official World Cup look.  And once again, EA upped the ante and produced the finest sports game crowd yet. In addition to fully animated spectators, you'll see waving flags, streamers, confetti, whole sections spelling out messages, and more.   The game's presentation is fantastic. It's obvious the developers spent a lot of time on making the celebrations memorable. When you score a goal, narrowly miss it, or commit a foul the camera instantly zooms in to get a close up of the player in question. Goal celebrations are delivered in slow motion, with confetti cannons going off in the background, the crowd roaring, and the orchestral music really driving the point home. Even it sometimes seems like EA's laying it on a bit too thick, it really captures the passion of football -- and its fans -- perfectly.  The framerate in the GameCube version is overall a bit more stable than both the Xbox and PS2 ones, but it does chug occasionally during player celebrations or when the camera zooms in for a replay. It may not be as smooth as the competing games from Sega and Konami, but the framerate drops never actually impact gameplay.  Sound John Motson and Andy Gray once again return as the official FIFA commentators and deliver timely and realistic play-by-play. Motson calls out all the correct player names (none of that ~Number 2~ stuff like in Konami's MLS game) while Gray butts in with the occasional color commentary about a team's World Cup History or some background info about the hosting city. If you play the game a lot, though, you're bound to hear repeat sentences at which point it's best to just switch it off and enjoy the game's excellent sound effects. Running in Dolby Pro-Logic Surround, 2002 FIFA World Cup not only lets you hear the crowd chants and ball sound effects, but also the players scream on the field below. EA recorded a bunch of different calls for a variety of languages, so if you ever wanted to learn what ~I'm open~ means in German, here's your chance to learn some deutsch. Not every team has their own calls, however, so get used to hearing the Polish and Danish team shout stuff in English.   Sadly, the game doesn't feature the teams' national anthems -- a strange oversight considering how accurately World Cup tries to bring home the atmosphere of the tournament. To make up for it, you'll hear a variety of chants from the spectators that make you feel like you're watching a real soccer match.2002 FIFA World Cup suffers from the old ~one step forward, two steps back~ problem. The game controls, looks, and sounds better than FIFA 2002, but with only two modes and very few options it feels a whole lot more limited. Even the token Friendly mode seems more like an afterthought than a full-fledged game mode -- you actually have to select your stadium, time of day, and other settings in the options menu before you go into the Friendly mode. Strange. Like EA's own SSX Tricky, World Cup features ~behind-the-scenes~ FMV content. In the case of the GameCube version, you'll find three documentary featurettes about the World Cup, soccer in general, and the fans. It's nice that EA spent some time and money on giving gamers some background on what the tournament is all about, but I wish more time was spent on adding more gameplay modes instead of a handful of shortlived documentaries. Still, it's a neat little extra bonus that helps establish the game as the only official, licensed game of the World Cup. If you're getting swept up in the excitement surrounding the tournament and you're looking for a great soccer game to help you relive your favorite moments, you certainly can't do wrong with 2002 FIFA World Cup. Like its predecessor, it's a fun soccer game that delivers both single-player and multi-player action. But if it's longevity you want, go for last year's FIFA -- you can probably pick it up for a better price, too.", "date": "Apr 24, 2002"}
