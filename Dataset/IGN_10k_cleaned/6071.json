And that's not the best ~mobile representations,~ that's over all. And I've been playing digital mahjong since I convinced my mom to buy Shanghai for the SEGA Master System. It's a puzzle game that lends itself perfect to the smallest screen, and it pleases me greatly to see JAMDAT giving the game the same treatment it would any of its other triple-A titles: Clean graphics, copious content, and nice production values.   For the uninitiated, mahjong is played by pairing matching tiles from a deliberately positioned stack. Tiles can only be yanked if they have no other tile on top of them (even if it's obscuring only a corner) and the ability to freely move out to the left or right. Most tiles have an exact match, but there are season and flower tiles that can be removed with another member of that tile group.   JAMDAT Mahjong offers thirty boards to clear. Unless you are a seasoned master, you will not do this in one sitting. Or maybe not even thirty sittings. There is some significant depth, as there are multiple approaches to every collection of tiles -- but it is possible to paint yourself into a corner where no matches remain. You have no choice at this point but to start over. If you manage to conquer the thirty boards, you unlock the Emperor mode for an extreme challenge.   JAMDAT Mahjong is an excellent single-player game, but there are multi-player functions, such as timed pass-and-play mode. The tiles are exquisitely presented -- easy to read and match up. I also liked the music, which was appropriately Asian-tinged, and the in-game sounds match the game perfectly.  If you like mahjong games or even if you are just a puzzle fan in general, give JAMDAT Mahjong the download. This is a satisfying, deep puzzle game with a few hours of play value -- and that's just on the first pass-through. I can imagine mahjong fans replaying several portions of the game. The online leaderboard is also a nice touch, and if you make it up there, feel good. It looks like there are some real pros already heavily into JAMDAT Mahjong.", "date": "Sep 23, 2005"}
