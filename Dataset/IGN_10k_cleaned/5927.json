Of course, that involved staying up late for no good reason and playing Keep Away with some poor bastard who had too much to drink and was trying to get his car keys back. Just because we were doing the right thing didn't mean that we couldn't have some fun with it. And some of those thrills (the air-grabbing, that is) are back with the best reason to attach a webcam to your PS2, EyeToy: Play 2. It has far surpassed the original EyeToy: Play as well as the other EyeToy games that have come out since then. That makes it number one of, well, five games, but it's still the best.   If you're not familiar with the whole EyeToy thing, then let me first congratulate you on the ability to blank out massive chunks of time since a few million of the gadgets have been sold around the world in the past two years. But as for what it does, the webcam puts the player in the game in that the video from the camera is displayed on the screen while the game overlays some graphics on top of it. In this way, the player is ~inside~ the game and with the EyeToy's ability to read the player's movement, the player can then smack and push around the different characters and objects that are falling, bouncing, and running around the screen.   In the first Play, the gameplay was innovative for the time, but most of the games included in it were basically about the player swatting things about. Cleaning the bubbles from the screen, smacking away ninjas, flailing away at ghosts, and so forth. It was a kick to be on the screen, but for the most part the games all felt like the same beast with different skins on top. So even if there was a large variety of games to choose from, they didn't feel very different. With the goal simply being trying different difficulty levels and getting a high score on slight variations of one game there wasn't a ton to dig into.   Play 2 seeks to change this up by providing much more context and freeing up the players from a static position on the screen. In terms of context, the DIY game is all about making your rapid hand movements mean something around the house, that is. Indeed, all the glorious activities of tending to a suburban home are taken care of here in a rapid-fire set of mini-games. Taking care of a flooding basement is done by alternating between sealing up leaky pipes and pumping the water out. Right after this, the task is to throw branches into a wood chipper followed up by the tasks of sawing some wood and then laying down some bricks into a wall. Shades of Wario Ware's rapid games are definitely felt here.    This collection of different types of activities rolled into one game help make Play 2 feel so much more involved than Play where there was just one thing to be done and done over and over. But when it comes to freeing up the players, one quick look at the GoalAttack game shows some of the future of EyeToy. Instead of being on the whole screen, the video from the EyeToy is shown inside of a soccer goal. By reaching out to the left or right, it's possible to shift the whole bit of video to the side. In this way the players get to actually block the soccer balls.     Moving over to the HomeRun game, Play 2 shows a way to make the player even more a part of the game. Here, the player swings with his or her hands at a ball and then ~runs~ by waving his or her hands up in the air, like the pumping of fists during a hard sprint. The EyeToy video turns into a square that moves around the bases and even slants down to slide into a base. It's a fantastic fusion of the player and the game and manages to show how people can have their own avatars inside the game instead of being relegated to windows in a screen such as the EyeToy use in World Championship Poker.   Looking through the rest of the list of games there are several other ways that the EyeToy has been given some more novel uses as well as games that have a fair amount of variety within that make them feel like more of a complete experience. There is the hand-waving fun of AirGuitar, the food prep and cooking in MrChef, and the advanced ninja fighting in Kung2. There are a couple of games that don't hold up quite as well as the others such as the repetitive action in SecretAgent and the odd physics of TableTennis, but overall the collection here is much more interesting than in Play 2.   But no matter how good these little games fare this time, they're still mini-games that don't lend themselves to extended play sessions. This collection is still about the goofing off from time to time and the multiplayer games here hold up just as strongly as the single-player games to provide a solid new party experience. Invite some friends over, make sure that the lighting in the room is good enough for the EyeToy to pick up on (a white wall in the background is a plus) and have a few laughs.    But all fun and games aside, Play 2 throws in a new treat that's sure to appeal to kids everywhere: the SpyToy. With this, the EyeToy can act as a bedroom security system. When activated, the camera can sound an alarm when someone enters the room or stay in stealth mode and record screens of the intruder so that the EyeToy owner will later have proof of the intrusion. The appeal of this for most adults is admittedly pretty slim, but I would've killed to have such a thing in college.   This is easily the best reason to own an EyeToy or get one with a Play 2 bundle. Still, no matter how good the games in Play 2 are and how much innovation there is here, the overall feeling is still like that of a collection of disparate games. This is a title that's well worth having for when friends come over or when you're feeling especially fond of seeing your own mug on the screen. There are numerous innovations that show what can be done with the little webcam, but the feeling of a whole game is still lacking.Just make sure that people use the camera on their faces if possible when they win a game and get to save a photo from the EyeToy. A buddy tried to take a photo while pointing the EyeToy down the inside of his pants. Fortunately, the light was low and the result is a bit like the Shroud of Turin that we fought valiantly to later cover up with a new image.", "date": "Aug 13, 2005"}
