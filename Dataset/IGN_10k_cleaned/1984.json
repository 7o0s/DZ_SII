Most people won't argue with the notion that car-combat has been quite dead for some time. I personally had fun playing Vigilante 8 in its time, but the latter two Twisted Metal games (3 and 4), Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012, and Vigilante 8: Second Offense just didn't draw me in like the original Twisted Metal titles. These games, at least on the systems they arrived on, pushed their respective systems to their limits (or didn't), expanded on the genre's original idea, but were bereft of fresh, original gameplay and, more importantly, an edge. In later days on PlayStation, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 turned the series into a stale, derivative property, a rerun series that 989 Studios had essentially run into the ground, clearly sending the message that with each title, gameplay was secondary to marketing.   With a conscious effort to bring fun back into car-combat games, Incog Inc. banded together to create the newest game in the series, Twisted Metal: Black for PlayStation 2. Their new effort is nothing short of amazing. These guys aren't saviors or gods, and they're not Satanists (as far as know), but they sure have tried hard to rip the old perception of Twisted Metal out of our collective consciousness in the effort to bring back respect to the Twisted Metal brand.   With black as a theme that runs throughout the game's marrow, the hard-edged, M-rated Twisted Metal: Black bears no resemblance to its precursors, save a few exceptions (such as genre and characters), and it is based on a strange adherence to violent images, death, and destruction. A strange adherence is a subtle way to put it. It almost seems like the designers at Incog. Inc. felt a certain loathing for every other car-combat game that was shoveled out before it and felt a violent, bloodthirsty necessity to wipe the slate clean. Personally, I don't blame them.   What they have created in their mad drive to perfection and purity (or something like that) is a fantastic romp of gameplay efficiency that's never really been seen before. Twisted Metal: Black punches through the old car-combat mold with a psychotic cast of hell-bent characters and death-machines thanks to the force of a visionary team that appears to have compromised nothing to achieve a pure car-combat game. I could just say that this games ~roxorz,~ and you'd get my point, but that's not the half of it. This thing kicks ~f*cking assorz,~ might be more like it.   Gameplay While the credit for this game certainly lies squarely in the hands on the creators, Incog. Inc., Twisted Metal: Black is also a product of the horsepower behind the PlayStation 2. For all of my talk about the last series of car-combat games being derivative, part of the problem wasn't just the direction or the staff. Part of it rests in the limitations of the system. You could only do some much with the PlayStation, as we all know. OK, so now, we have a new system, and Incog. Inc. has not only tapped the surface of the system, it's dug into its belly, and untwisted its intestines. In doing so, the team has created a game that executes on all levels. Twisted Metal: Black is a fast, fast, fast game. FAST, you hear? In the single-player modes, it moves at a blistering 60 frames per second, and it looks, feels, and plays with instant reactions from the cars. In the multiplayer mode with four cars on the screen, split-screen style, it slows down just a touch, but with a slightly altered camera and just a wee bit more fogging, it still works unflinchingly. On every plane, the control, AI, and level design equally fire on all cylinders.   The controls are solid, but they take some time to master. The control system enables players to choose from three different setups, from Classic to 'Run and Gun' to Control Freak, and somewhere in there, people can find what they want. I personally choose Classic, and use the analog buttons, while my cohort, Dave Z. likes the same setup, but uses the digital pad. With Classic, players use L2 for projectile pickups, and R2 for machine guns. L1 and R1 function as the select weapons buttons.   Incog brought back ~moves,~ in which players connect a set of dpad movements for a Special, like in a fighting game for instance, and they incorporated ~skill~ moves, as well as rear drops, too. For Skill moves players need to aim and time their shots for maximum effect, with a risk-and-reward system that is exactly that. These add a new layer of depth that enables players who absolutely love Twisted Metal to extend their skill to the next level of combat. And with a game of this depth, casual gamers can get to grips with the basic moves but not feel left out, while diehards can quickly move up to the next level.   Twisted Metal: Black is not a short game. It's deep with relevant gameplay modes and replay value. Comprised of a three-part single-player game, and a three-part Multi-player setup, this game offers long hours of play. In one-player, you can choose from Story (one character's fight to the top of Calypso's Contest and an accompanying story), Challenge (pick a character and a level and fight to the finish), and Endurance (Fight an endless series of opponents with one car). The Multiplayer mode offers two four-player deathmatch, two-player co-op (a two-player split-screen cooperative version of Story, with one set of lives), which I have never seen in a car-combat game before, and Two-player Lastman Standing (pick an identical set of cars and whoever is left standing wins). The Story mode is my favorite, and the Multiplayer is handled wonderfully. Both are awesome.   The cars handle and feel good. Each has its set of characteristics that enable it to move faster and corner better, but may provide less armor or special attack power. Many cars lie somewhere in between the driving specialties speed and handling or the weapons-based armor and special attacks. Even though, for instance, Sweet Tooth moves as slow as molasses, he has a brutally powerful Special Attack that makes up for any lack of speed. Likewise, smaller, more speedy vehicles, such as Mr. Grimm, may not have as much Armor or as powerful as Specials, but he's one fast dude.   Every car is equipped with a limited amount of Turbo (press down R3), and every vehicle can perform all of the same basic moves as the other. Each is also equipped with a special weapon. I found that I liked almost all of the car designs, and found that they're all balanced relatively well in performance. They respond instantly to your commands, with no slowdown or pause in between pressing the button and action. The power is instant and each car feels great as a result. They're extremely versatile on the whole: Players can spin on a dime. They can turn in mid-air off a jump and have a seemingly natural tendency to land on their wheels. Fly off a jump and you may find that the car has landed on its side or upside down. No sweat, it instantly turns over. Well, it's not instant, it takes a second or two, and I wish it were faster, but perhaps if you have landed on your head, there is a little punishment to suffer as a consequence, no? Still, the cars in total feel responsive and speedy. Even the trucks and heavy dudes respond quite quickly for their respective heft.   While I have never given two hoots about the characters in the previous games, these characters are so messed up, so hopeless, and presented so well, that I actually care about what happens to them. For instance, I wanted to know what happened to my character, John Doe, and I felt true emotions for his outcome. I smiled when he discovered his identity, and likewise, I felt a wave of sorrow rush across me when I learned about his outcome. Incog Inc. has taken great care to set up their profiles, and the game, very seriously; it's a feeling that is well presented in the overall design.   Twisted Metal: Black is set up so that players select a character and a car together. So, you always drive the Ice Cream truck when you pick Sweet Tooth, Roadkill when you choose John Doe, and Brimstone with the preacher. The list of instantly accessible characters includes Junkyard Dog (Bill Ray), Brimstone (Preacher), Outlaw (Agent Stone), Mr. Grimm (Mr. Grimm), Roadkill (John Doe), Crazy 8 (No-Face), Spectre (Bloody Mary), Darkside (Dollface), Shadow (Raven), and Sweet Tooth (Sweet Tooth). The extra characters feature a partial cast from the first games, including Black, Cage, Axel, Mr. Kane and Son, and Raven. Minion and Calypso appear as the first and second bosses, respectively.   Against the game's AI, players will find that this cast of rebels, suicidal maniacs, and deadly losers is anything but easy. In my first hours of playing Twisted Metal: Black I admit, I was sucking hard. I hadn't played in so long that I had essentially lost my skills. Part of my learning experience, however, was not entirely all due to my weakened skills. The game itself has a steep, fearsome learning curve. For the first couple of levels, until I felt good and ready, I played on Easy, and I can't remember the last time I did that on any game.   The enemies burst away at turbo speeds, avoiding your weapon fire. They use the obstacles, such as seemingly randomly placed junk piles of small blockades, pillars, mountainsides, cliffs, and walls to escape your long-range projectiles. They are programmed to recognize when they are weakened, and zip away at ultra-fast speed to avoid uncertain death. They also appear to know when you're low on life, too. Also, they often attack in packs, although I'm not sure how much of that is actually programmed in or is the culmination of programmed patterns that simply collide at given moments. This game ain't easy if you haven't played before; and for those who have, it's going to be months of play.   The bosses are especially annoying. When a boss is cheap and stupid, annoying is a bad quality. But here, their relentless attacks were unswerving. These guys have weaknesses, but you truly have to work hard to beat them. That's the way it should be, right? Bosses should be hard, and when I beat a boss without trying too hard, I'm disappointed. When I beat Minion and Warhawk, I was relieved and full of haughty pride. Finally! I beat them -- F@ck yes! These bosses will certainly work you over.   Lastly, the level design is both interesting and challenging. I liked the first two levels, Zorko Brothers Scrap and Salvage and Suburbs. Scrap and Salvage is an excellent level that shows off a solid set of environmental traps, interactive areas, and lines that lead to rewards on at least two stories. It's big but not too ominous. On the other hand, a level like Snowy Roads is much simpler. It's an arched road, lined with mountains on both sides, with only a few places to hide, but it works. And then there is Highway Loop, which I initially hated. It seemed difficult to get away from anyone, and while this is actually true, when I began using the branches and the multiple tiers to my advantage, it became more friendly, and I grew to like it as one of my favorite.   The level design is multifaceted. The sheer scale of these levels has never been seen before in car-combat games. This is certainly an advantage that a next-generation system brings, but Incog Inc. has created a wide range of levels that, whether you like them or not, offer variety, size, and require slightly different skills for each.   Suburbs floored me at first. It's huge. I mean, that's not even the right word. It's massive. At first, all I did was plow down houses and shoot missiles as far as I could, a wild frenzy of glee. My first impressions were of awe. This is, of course, the famed level in which players can knock off the Ferris Wheel that rolls into ocean. As I played more levels, and came back to Suburbs, I realized that I actually liked the more condensed levels, and that this area was just too big. Later on, I came back to play it and realized that it just requires different strategies to use to for the best advantage. It took me a while to grasp the Suburbs' complexity.   Speaking about stunning stuff, this game is totally combustible, filled with details, and does things that no car-combat games have ever done before. Almost everything in Twisted Metal: Black is somehow purposefully breakable. Churches can be driven through or smashed to bits, houses crumble like cards, and barriers near the parameters of levels brace players against dying, but they are also destructible and can give way to an untimely death. These levels are not just breakable, but multi-tiered, filled with secret passages, jumps, lines that lead to special power-ups and health pick-ups, and huge jumps -- and falls.   Some are just amazingly innovative. In Prison Passage, one of the most stunning levels, players start off in a jail cell, which later opens up into to reveal that it's actually a jail cell on a moving ship. Then even later, the ship docks on a beach, and players can then drive onto hard land. You may not even notice this all happening at first, but it's all happening around you. In short, these levels are well tested and proven combat grounds. You may not like them all at first, but even Minion's Stadium is unique in its own way. Suffice it is to say, the levels are amazing.   Graphics With the framerate at 60, the game is just speedy as hellfire. But with crappy animations, bad vehicle design, and cruddy particle systems, it would all be for naught. Luckily, with Twisted Metal: Black, everything is taken care of -- the car design, animations, particle systems, and the level design: They're all top-notch.   While keeping the framerate high, it's difficult to create a great set of textures that greatly differ from one another. Naturally, not all of the textures in the environments are Egyptian hieroglyphics or painterly Van Goghs, but the highly detailed cars and the variation of the textures are still quite impressive for any game. As for the location backgrounds, it appears that the designers knew they had to reduce megabyte size, so the colors are speckled, rusted, and layered to create something out of nothing. The color palette is dark, but its uses variations of dull and dark colors to infuse differentiation. Nary is there a primary color for the Mario kids. (And hey, I liked Mario.)   Most of the car designs and animations are very good, and a few are just brilliant. Instead of picking up and dropping weapons from the side of the road, players pick up weapons, and each one automatically appears from a secret compartment on the side or rear-end of the car, and then the delivery unit closes back up again and disappears once it's used. It's clean and neat; it's cool looking and always unique to the car. It's awesome. Sweet Tooth's special is the clear benefactor of this design: When activated, Sweet Tooth's humble, broken down little ice cream trucks morphs in realtime into a rocket-shooting transformer, accompanied by a evil laugh and the distorted sounds of an ill-tuned ice-cream melody. Everything about the game's presentation suggests evil minds at work.   On top of that, the particle system is bitchin'. When I first launched a missile across the Suburbs, and watched it sail across the sky -- all the way to the other end of the screen, followed by a little explosion in the distance and the enemy's life gauge lowering -- I was in awe. The level of exploding bits, firepower, and fiery items is just outstanding. The culmination of them, in a crowded fight, is all too amazing. It's even more than most people can take. But if you look at this thing is slow motion, you would see an enormous amount of stuff happening. Smoke and fire look like smoke and fire, and when something explodes, it's not just on one level. It's jaw-dropping. For example, there is a huge gaseous fireball, with a ring of larger fiery stuff that blows out, and also with tiny little white-hot bits splintering off into the air on top of it all. Ashes? Yes, ashes, too. Perhaps my favorite set of special effects is the contrails on the Zoomy. Oh yes, these are sweet.   Sound The musical design is this game builds a wall of metallic, off-tune, and eerie sounds that throw players off the center, and thereby creates a sense of brooding and anxiety. This it does well. While no bands are credited for creating this music, the menu music alone sounds as if it were created by Nine Inch Nails.   Credited in the manual, SCEA's Chuck Doud worked with the outside studio, Scorpio Sound, who mustered up an epic round of menacing tunes that all sound as if they're from the last minutes of a suspense movie. From arcing gothic tunes to battle scene music, nicely decorated with choirs and strings, the original music for this game is unique and suiting for the battles. The game delivers overbearing melodies that mix techno sounds with orchestrated instruments, for an overall effect that could be quite frightening when listened to on their own.   The special effect sounds are loud, numerous, and some are truly incredible. One of the most intimidating vehicle sounds for me is that of the trucker, Darkside, driven by Dollface. When I hear that ominous truck horn, I know I'm in trouble. The only question I have is, how bad will it be?   As with the graphics and other areas of presentation, the music and sound effects help to create a twisted, dark and menacing set of sensations that run right down to the game's core.After many, many hours of Twisted Metal: Black I am still quite awe-struck with the overall gameplay in this beautiful, incredible title. It's just as impressive in gameplay as it is as in a technical sense. The only flaws are really my own preferences for weapons and cars. I don't like the slower vehicles, such as Darkside and JunkyardDog, but I do like Sweet Tooth (and honestly, who doesn't?). I'm not fond of the weapons that have to be heaved, such as JunkyardDog's, and I'm not a big fan of the Rico, for instance. But I can see why these elements are used, and I can see why they might be liked. But Twisted Metal: Black is so much bigger than my petty little grievances. It's gorgeous and deep. It's a great as a single-player and a multiplayer game. Packed with secrets that are cleverly placed in all sorts of game modes (not just in the Story mode), it's as sharp as a knife. The game delivers the ultimate car-combat experience, and is leaps and bounds above any games of its ilk. I highly recommend it. No, I issue you as a PlayStation 2 owner to go buy this ASAP. Go! :) I have beaten the games a couple of times, and I have many hours left to go before I can truly say I have finished it. So, now, I'm going back. Warhawk, your ass is mine. Go get this game, it's one of the very best on the PlayStation 2, period. Where are you, Warhawk?", "date": "Jun 18, 2001"}
