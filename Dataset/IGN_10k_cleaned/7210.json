It was almost a benchmark to system power back then  today, it's how many polygons you can push, but a decade ago, it was how many moving objects are on the screen. And back in the eighties, you couldn't get a shooter with more quality graphics and gameplay then Irem's R-Type series. And now, you can get the two biggest R-Type games released in arcades in ASCII's compilation pack, R-Types.  R-Types features the original R-Type that made it to arcades in the U.S., thanks to Nintendo. The disc also has R-Type II, a lesser-release arcade unit that, chances are, you've never played. You're not going to be bowled over in terms of graphics  but brother, you've never played a game on the PlayStation that's as challenging as these two.  Both games have the same formula: you're a lone ship flying into enemy territory, and there are tons of bad guys out to destroy you. Problem is, one shot and your ship is toast. No shields, no hit-points, nothing. Hit an enemy, bullet, or wall, and you've lost a life. Luckily, every once in a while you're offered a power-up or two that will speed up your ship, or better yet, give your ship the added firepower. There's an orb that shows up that you can attach to the front or back of your craft for increased weaponry  or you can throw it ahead of you and let it hover on its own for a bit.  The difference between the two games is mostly cosmetic, since both games share very similar gameplay. Obviously R-Type II looks a little better since it was released later than the original, but other than the different stages of shooting action, you'll be doing the same thing in R-Type II that you did in R-Type. The game is one hell of a challenge, though, and even if you're a seasoned gamer, you're going to have a hard time getting through this game. And that's the big reason to give this game a shot  for the challenge of it all. And besides, many PlayStation gamers haven't experienced the same style of game that we did who grew up in the 1980s. You want to feel a bit nostalgic? Go ahead and get R-Types. But don't expect more than what the game offered a decade and a half ago.", "date": "Feb 27, 1999"}
