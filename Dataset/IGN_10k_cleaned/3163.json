On the one hand, Enter the Dragonfly is nearly identical in every manner possible to its predecessors. It's got cute, likeable Spyro, the levels are filled with easy-to-collect gems, enemies and enough space to create a feeling o exploration. It's filled with mini-games, too, lots relatively clever mini-games to steal your valuable time. And since nothing was ever dislikeable about Spyro, these are all good things.    But much like Universal's Crash Bandicoot on PlayStation 2, Enter the Dragonfly is essentially a replica game, a side step or a lateral move rather than a step forward. It's not like I want every new game to be revolutionary, but at the very least, it's got to hold my interest. And considering the high quality games from last year as well as several great games from this year, Enter the Dragonfly doesn't hold up. What's perhaps more disappointing is that neither visually nor with regards to gameplay is the game an equal game to the remake of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex. It's inferior in quality to that game.   So, what it comes down to is this: Are you up for more of the exact same Spyro game? If so, this is your game. If you're looking for something more sophisticated, complex and representative of a next-generation platformer, then you may want Ratchet and Clank.   Gameplay  If you haven't played any of the three Spyro the Dragon games on PlayStation, then you have missed one of the more charming, classy and well-rounded platformers on the system. Originally designed and created by Insomniac Games, the Spyro series brought new little essentials to platform games, including a looser, more free-roaming camera, gems that could be magnetically collected and a substantial and likeable supporting cast of characters. The result was an incredibly likeable franchise platformer that spanned three games on that system and sold millions of copies.   Now that Universal Interactive has taken full control of both the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon series, the current-generation versions of these series have maintained the games, more or less, right in line with the previous ones. That is to say, very little has changed; very little is new. If you have played the previous titles, you have essentially played this one, too.    That said, I hadn't played Spyro in quite a while, and steeping myself deep in Spyro's world again was, in a way, a relaxing, comforting experience. This is a game you can pick up and play for a while, set down for days or even weeks, return to, and continue playing. Enter the Dragonfly is like peanut butter and jelly or grilled cheese sandwiches, it's the comfort food of videogames. You won't be shocked or surprised by any of it, but it's good fun if you just need something light and easy to play.   The story is quite generic. After having stolen dragon eggs, elder dragons, and baby dragons in previous versions, evil forces have now kidnapped the new generation of dragonfly companions that would otherwise guide the youth of the dragon race. Thus, it's up to the ever-young Spyro and Sparx to re-capture them and to restore order to the dragon world. In doing so, you explore nine areas, each packed with collectible gems and dragonflies. Each world contains 10 dragonflies, and the approximate value of 600-900 gems (some gems are worth more than others). The new worlds, like before, are full 3D arenas, branching into smaller areas and catapulting Spyro into a variety of sub-worlds. They're all quite expansive, including tropical islands, Japanese dojos, icy plains, country farms (complete with farmers and flying saucers), and more.    Like I said before, Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly, with a few minor additions, is a lateral iteration of Spyro: Year of the Dragon, with a few minimal additions that amass the little dragon's repertoire and expand his expertise driving vehicles. The biggest new features to the series come in the form of a slew of inventive mini-games, a solid garage of vehicles to pilot, the ability to climb specific walls, and new forms of dragon breath. The kinds of additions made in Enter the Dragonfly are essentially little ones. Spyro can now pilot tanks, planes, UFOs and a vehicle called the Mantaray; he can participate in numerous races, and he even gets to play a little music, Simon Says style.      The collection bit of Enter the Dragonfly is not terribly annoying, though it's clear this is a 32-bit platform model, based on predominantly on collecting. The only slightly interesting wrinkle, which involves collecting dragonflies (each with its own name), is that you have to, um...catch them all. Yes, it's a little Pokemon-ish. You also collect different kinds of breath, which add a little bit of newness to an otherwise familiar palette. You get flame breath, and earn bubble breath, with which to capture dragonflies, ice breath, to freeze things, and electric breath, with which to shock enemies. Each performs best on the level it's designed for (with the exception of bubble breath, which is solely for capturing dragonflies). Spyro can also now protect himself with a deflect ability, and can perform similar moves from previous games, such as gliding, head bashing and hovering. Climbing, however, is new. When Spyro sees a wall with ladder likes lines on it, by pressing X he can climb it. And those familiar magic spirals are back again, enabling Spyro to return to higher platforms by simply stepping into them.    Level-design wise, you'll experience nothing new. There is a hub section, gates to open up after having collected enough dragonflies, and more arenas and sub-worlds to explore, all opened up when you have collected enough dragonflies. With regard to characters, numerous pals from Spyro's past have returned, including MoneyBags, Hunter, Zoe, Bianca and Sparx.    The load times are long, there are various little glitches here and there, and essentially, the game doesn't change its course from the beginning to the end. Like I said, it's the comfort food of videogames.    Graphics  While many Enter the Dragonfly's visuals are worth noting on their own, overall, Universal's game looks like a high-res PlayStation game, and it's not impressive by any means.   Many of the animations have improved over previous games. Spyro zooms around with excellent motions, and the particle effects, as always, create a magical, Fourth of July-style feeling. Stalks of corn sway back and forth as do tall grassy patches when Spyro moves through them, and there's a rich fantasy-style look to the worlds. Flowers, bushes and trees all look substantial. The icy levels show off great reflective surfaces, and the underwater locales are rich with ornaments, too.    But after that, the visuals quickly careen downhill. The framerate suffers often, chugging from around a maximum of 30 fps downward, depending on the area. Which is kind of strange, because these worlds aren't much bigger than those on the PlayStation versions of Spyro. There aren't many more enemies on screen, and the textures are still the same, simple flat shaded swaths of primary colors, just like the others. Oftentimes, entire areas pop in because of weird problems with load issues.    Sound  Perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of Universal's game is the music. As with the previous games, the music has been a big plus, with the first two games featuring former Police drummer Stewart Copeland. Here, the musical scores seem to continue the trend of lush musical landscapes, but this time, the themes tend to flow with mellower flavors. The music is actually soothing, and though I listened to it for hours on end, the repetition never bothered me once. The sound effects are decent, too, as are the voice actors. All of the characters are cartoony is sound, but they're cute, goofy and enjoyable to hear. All in all, Spyro the Dragon is only a slightly better than average platformer. Slightly. Up against games such as Sly Cooper and Ratchet and Clank, it doesn't hold a candle. Even up against games such as Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Spyro falters. Shoulder to shoulder with previous versions of Spyro, it's essentially the exact same playing experience, with minimal additions. Which is the crux of the matter. If you want to play something that's easy and comfortable, that doesn't challenge you in any way, then you'll like this. If you want something entirely new, or even remotely resembling a next-generation experience, then forget it. Spyro is still a cute, adorable and very likeable character and this game is mindless, easy fun, but its simply more of the same old stuff.", "date": "Nov 8, 2002"}
