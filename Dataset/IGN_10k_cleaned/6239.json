Players didn't react to your input commands in a timely manner and just navigating the menus to set things up just how you wanted them took far too long with the game struggling to load each screen. With FIFA Soccer 06 the gameplay has become much smoother and the controls are far more user-friendly. Is it good enough to justify a second purchase of a soccer game from the same company? Probably not, but if you missed FIFA six months ago and have been waiting for another soccer game, your wait may be over with FIFA 06.   Gameplay   The biggest enhancement to gameplay is the unique PSP-specific feel to the game. Jamming the PS2 version of the game into the PSP console didn't turn out so well last time. For 06, the players are more responsive and crucial features --like first touch control-- that are so popular on the console have been re-mapped in a way that makes more sense. When you want to throw freestyle moves or play the ball into a space of your choosing as a pass comes to you, just hold down the left shoulder button and point the analog stick to pull your move or use first touch. This is a huge improvement over using the D-pad, something that made the feature useless last time out.    There are little things that show the development team was paying attention this time around. With no right analog stick to wiggle when you want to jostle with a player while going after a 50/50 ball, you just have to madly tap on the conservative tackle button (circle) and your guy will muscle in and make a play on the ball. You don't have to worry about him getting in and wildly shooting the ball once he gains possession since circle is also the shoot button. Pace control was an addition that works on top of the freestyle moves that came on the console versions and it hasn't been ignored for the PSP. Holding down the select button and moving the pseudo-analog stick (we call it psanalog) will put you into slowed down pace control mode where you don't have to worry about your player being to fast and overrunning the ball or play in front of him.     The new Juggling minigame is another major addition to FIFA for PSP. It's a simple game that merely requires that you tap in a proper direction on the D-pad with proper timing to keep a soccer ball bouncing off of a player's feet, knees, shoulder and head for as long as possible. The cool thing is, you turn the PSP itself 45 degrees counter clockwise with the D-pad towards the bottom to play the Juggling game. The player of your choosing is shown from head to toe and takes up the length of the screen while playing in this mode.    Visuals   During the run of play, the players move a bit more smoothly than in the previous edition of FIFA even though the player models themselves are so tiny that they barely look better than the colored blocks of Intellivision-era videogame athletes. When you get cutscenes and replays after goals, fouls and other pauses in play, the guys still have the heavy outline that makes them look a little like cardboard cutouts from the rest of the background. The player faces, uniform details and hairstyles all look impressive however, even if they don't have the rich facial animations seen in the Xbox version of FIFA 06.   Stadiums and crowds again don't matchup to their console counterparts, but they get the job done on a system that fits in the palm of your hand. You'll see team-specific signs that are actually legible and supporters that buzz with activity when their team does something great.   Audio   The commentary is actually spot-on with the same announcers doing the duties in the PSP version. Of course it gets repetitive as you play game after game, settling into established patterns of attacking and defending.   One new twist is the stoppage time alarm. Whenever the game clock is showing 45:00 or 90:00 rather than try to flash how much time has been tacked on like we see in the console versions, you simply hear an alarm sounding to indicate the official may blow the whistle at any moment.     The EA Pocket Trax is jammed with all kinds of music from around the world too. This time around K'naan and Embrace are the big winners as they have music videos for their singles included in the PSP version of FIFA 06.  FIFA Soccer 06 is an improvement and pretty much the FIFA for PSP soccer fans have (and should've been) waiting for. It's smoother, feels better and doesn't feel so much like a PS2 game squeezed into a PSP's body. The juggling game is a nice quick way to get in some gameplay (and drain your battery) without committing to an entire game but really isn't much more than DDR with a soccer star. It would've been nice to see some connectivity between this PSP version and the PS2 version of FIFA 06 like we saw with Madden NFL 06 for both systems. Franchise mode is a big deal to soccer fans too, so it could be something we see in the future.", "date": "Oct 28, 2005"}
