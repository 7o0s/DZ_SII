He's been on nearly every system known to man, even making it to the PC in a network game a few years back. Hudson's put this little guy to the test, too -- though his real success has been in the overhead multiplayer battle, they've tried him in everything. Adventure, puzzle...heck, he was even in a racing game on the PlayStation. The last time Bomberman made it to the portable screen was Pocket Bomberman, an action platformer that wasn't too bad, but it certainly lacked the original's flair.Bomberman Max is Hudson's attempt to capitalize on the success of Pokmon -- or rather, to borrow its multi-cartridge elements in order to extend the gameplay (and make a few more cartridge sales in the meantime). What's great is, this is true, classic Bomberman -- if you loved the overhead challenges of the classic games, you're going to like what you get here. But even though the game is an absolute blast to play (no pun attended), like most Bomberman games of late, something's not quite right about this one too...FeaturesEighty areasBattle modeBattery save (two slots)Only for Game Boy ColorIf you're familiar with the classic Bomberman overhead game, then you know what to expect here. In Bomberman Max, your task is to jump through five zones with a dozen levels each. At the beginning of the round, you're given your quota to meet -- in some levels, you'll have to destroy all the enemies. In another, wipe out all the blocks in the land. In another, rescue the level's Charabomb (we'll get to those guys in a second). And in others, simply make your way to the target square in the set amount of time. But they don't make it easy, since many enemies just don't stay still for you to walk up and plant a bomb next to them. It's all in the strategy of bomb-placement. Plus, once a level's complete, you'll have to pick the proper exit that appears. Remember it well.Bomberman's abilities really haven't changed in this new edition. You can plant bombs to take out blocks -- some destroyed blocks reveal powerups that give Bomberman all his cool skills. Some increase the width of the bomb explosions, others let Bomberman drop multiple bombs at the same time. There are those that give you powerful explosions, allow you to throw and kick bombs...powerups play a HUGE part in the overall Bomberman experience.Remember the mention of Charabombs? These little guys show up from time to time -- pick up one of these animals and he's yours to keep. As you play through the levels, you'll pick up powerup icons that will only affect the Charabomb in your inventory -- the whole idea is to improve the strength of this Charabomb for the Battle Mode. In Battle Mode, you have one of your Charabomb critters go up against another player's that he's earned. This is a simple game of Rock/Paper/Scissors -- you get one turn to choose three attacks from a list. When you've made your choice, you link up with your buddy through the Infra Red link -- once the data's been sent and received by both systems, the battle is on. The game is completely predetermined ahead of time based on the Charabomb's abilities, class, and what attacks you chose, so the animation on-screen is merely cosmetic. The winner actually gets to keep the other person's Charabomb, so you better choose wisely. This Battle Mode is nice, but it doesn't make up for the blatant omission of another multiplayer mode...Bomberman Max is sold in two different flavors: Blue Champion Edition; and Red Challenger Edition. Like Pokmon, both versions of Bomberman Max have the same elements as one another -- the obvious difference is in the fact that in the Blue version you play as Bomberman, and in the Red edition, Max. Both characters move, play, and act the same -- the only difference is in the graphics. There are slight changes in the bomb and explosion sprites between the two characters. But don't think that's all there is...Those Hudson boys are really sneaky -- the only way you're going to complete the game at 100% is to interface one version of the game with another. Some levels and Charabomb creatures that are in Champion Edition aren't in Challenger, and vice versa. To get them all, you'll have to have a friend send over levels he's uncovered in his edition through the use of the Infra Red port. It's not a trade -- he can hand over levels and get zilch in the process. Isn't that nice of him?The single player game plays great -- it's very much like a scrolling version of the classic Bomberman we all know and love. Some of the missions are EXTREMELY difficult early on, but thankfully the game has battery back-up as well as unlimited continues. Even after playing the game for more than five hours, I still have only seen 10% of the levels. Now that's lastability.The only real problem with the game is the absolutely disappointing lack of link cable mode. What's Bomberman without two or more people duking it out with a flurry of bomb explosions lighting up the playing field? The Battle Mode included is nice, but a FAR cry from what should be in the game -- a full-on, classic Bomberman game experience. It's just common courtesy, guys. You tease us with a great single-player mode that plays just like the multiplayer games, but then don't offer what we really want. Sheesh.Bomberman Max is a great game for the Game Boy Color -- vivid graphics, nice tunage, and gameplay that'll last you a good long time. The game even has a cool feature using any infra-red device -- land on a special square, and you'll be prompted to beam a remote at the Infra-Red eye at the top of the system. Do this, and you'll enter a secret bonus stage to earn lives. Pretty cool. But darn it, why couldn't there be link cable support in this game? I can't believe we finally get back the classic Bomberman design, and not get multiplayer in the process.  Still, I'll take what I can get, but I'm still voicing my disappointment. But overall, you should definitely put either version of Bomberman Max in your collection because the single-player mode is top notch.", "date": "May 26, 2000"}
