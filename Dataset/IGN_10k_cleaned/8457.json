There's narry a screenshot, impression, video or preview of the a new heist game from Crave Entertainment, Monte Cristo Games and Eko System on any U.S. videogame site, and that's usually not a good sign. Add in the $15 price point, numbers for letters in the title and minimal box art for the casual gamer to garner an impression from, and Th3 Plan has all the makings of an industry pariah -- so imagine my surprise when I actually found myself enjoying it.   I  I like Th3 Plan  is there something wrong with me?   If you've seen any of the recent string of heist flicks -- The Italian Job, Ocean's 13, etc. -- the plot of Th3 Plan is easy enough to get into and predict. Robert Taylor (codename the Mind) and his college buddy Stephen Foster have formed a team to snag two Rembrandt paintings and sell them for a huge diamond. Things go awry during the robbery, co-cat burglar Alan Siegel (codename Poker) gets pinched, and Foster nabs one of the paintings while leaving the Mind to deal with the disaster. Jump forward five years, and the Mind busts Poker out of the pen and forms a new team to take down Foster.   Everybody, stand! The saving grace to Th3 Plan's tired plot? You control all three members of your team in real time. When you begin a mission, the screen splits into three parts -- one takes up the majority of the TV while the other two divide the space below -- and each gives you a real-time look at what the characters are doing. It's like watching an episode of 24. You can command the secondary team members with the D-Pad, or swap them into the main area via the shoulder buttons and have access to their position in the level and all of their supplies.   The control scheme might sound complicated, but having control of everyone is essential to accomplishing your objectives (see: screwing over Foster). For instance, one level had the team on a train trying to capture photographic evidence of the backstabber meeting with the Mafia. With soldiers crawling all over the locomotive and the squad chumming around with a wanted fugitive, keeping a low profile was paramount. So, Val Carrera -- the buxom femme fatale of the group (codename Cat) -- distracted a waitress so the boys could slip into a restricted area. The Mind held open the train's trap doors, Poker climbed onto the roof of the train, and Cat wandered the cabins distracting guards as Poker shimmied past windows when his path on top of the locomotive was blocked. As I clicked back and forth between mini-screens, there was no denying how cool the teamwork mechanic was.    Although the majority of missions has you running to yellow dots on the map to grab something so that you can open something else and enact some other event, the process isn't as monotonous as it might seem -- at least not all the time. Sometimes you'll have to sneak up behind guards and pickpocket items. The process begins with you approaching the John, choosing to pickpocket and then moving to a yellow marker on screen. Once on the directive, the outline of a hand appears on screen, and it's up to you to use the left analog stick to navigate a matching, moving picture of the hand into the outline. Keep the moving picture over the shadow as you grow closer to your mark, and you'll successfully rob the unsuspecting grunt. Even if it's not a primary mission objective, you can rob people at will throughout the missions. If you get enough money, you'll unlock the ability to replay the level with one or two in-house friends.    Now, even through there's a handful of cool moments -- such as marching through the train tasering anyone and everyone who gets in your way -- this game's not perfect. For starters, developers decided to forgo computer-animated cut scenes and instead used graphic novel-type imagery. That's not to say the comic book style is a bad idea, it's just poorly used in Th3 Plan. If you're going to use art as images, at least get someone who can draw. These images look so bad that they make the in-game graphics, which are going to hurt the eyes of next-gen gamers, look great.   Although the comic book interludes use voice work -- cheesy voice work -- the text that pops up on screen in game is only spoken about half the time. A scene that had no voice work will suddenly be followed by a scene that has the characters ready to chat it up. I guess I'm an all or nothing guy, and the mix in Th3 Plan is sloppy.   Pick this. I enjoyed the thought-provoking gameplay (what do I need Cat to do to let Poker get in that air duct?), but I did find myself getting frustrated whenever my team went into a tight space and the game bricked an otherwise awesome moment. While attempting to flee from the train, Poker and the Mind have to take out a series of armed guards. This means one of the guys has to surrender and the other guy has to sneak up on the arresting agent to choke the enemy out. It's an awesome idea, but when a guard would get caught on a doorframe or not give me enough room between his back and the wall to choke him out, I'd have to restart the level and figure out a way to make the apprehension easier on the game. Lame.Look up ~not for everyone~ in the dictionary, and you won't find an entry -- that isn't a word, dumbass. But if we could look up that phrase in a dictionary, we'd find a picture of Th3 Plan. In a market filled with run-and-gun action games, Plan's level-wandering and switch-throwing isn't going to appeal to everyone. Yet, if you have $15 and a day or so to kill, this title will keep you entertained as you unleash your inner-Clooney.", "date": "May 10, 2007"}
