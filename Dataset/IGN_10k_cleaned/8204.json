The smell of putrid vomit flying overhead at one hundred feet, the curdled screams of obese women, rolling flesh cut raw against the ever-tightening safety bars, refreshments so expensive they'd cover the cost of third-world vaccinations on one soft drink alone for a month. FUN! It was only a matter of time then before someone realised they'd make the perfect fodder for a videogame.   Of course, by ~time~, we're referring all the way back to the halcyon days of 1994, when teenage boys demanded more of their computer-based entertainment than gruff-voiced marines with crew cuts. Back, in fact, when Peter Molyneux's Bullfrog studio was responsible for some of the most original, acclaimed software on PC - or anywhere else for that matter. One such game, Theme Park, captured the hearts of sim fans everywhere - well, my mum at least - spawning countless imitators in the form of Roller Coaster Tycoon, er, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 and well, you get the picture.     It's a funny old world is the videogames industry and now, 13 years later, the game that started it all is back parading around on Nintendo's DS. Of course, fans of the handheld have been clamouring for some decent management sim action since some bright spark put two and two together, making ~Oh my God, the touchscreen's a bit like a mouse~. Apparently heeding that soldier's cry, EA's Japanese studio has been hard at work, transforming Bullfrog's aging PC classic into a modern day stylus-prodding wonder. Quite a feat when you consider the massive pig's ear previous developers made of everything from Zoo Tycoon to The Sims itself on DS.   For late comers or the perennially forgetful, at its heart Theme Park is your traditional resource management sim, demanding the constant, minute adjustment of myriad variables in order to squeeze as much money out of your endeavours as possible. All wrapped up in a glorious theme park bow, this means tending to the whims of your park guests - laying down new rides, keeping things tidy, minimising walking distances and other causes of grumpiness - all to make them so delirious with glee, they won't notice how much you're wringing out their wallets on admission prices, gift shop merchandise and refreshments.     Of course, it's not that simple and there's plenty of micromanagement involved in Theme Park - whether it's keeping an eye on stock, dealing with belligerent staff members and union strikes, juggling R&D costs, to name a few. In other words, there's so much to do in Theme Park, you'll barely have time to stop and consider whether you're actually having fun. Chances are though, the sheer charm, humour and undeniable depth that punctuate the proceedings guarantee that you will. Frankly too, kudos to EA's Japanese team because, bar some simplification of visitor tracking (which sadly means your guests don't quite have the same degree of personality as in the PC original and, alas, no longer wave umbrellas around when it rains), pretty much everything you could hope for has made it over to the DS.   Even more impressive is the elegant interface EA has crafted, ensuring every option, detail and statistic is always readily available, clearly presented and but a stylus tap away. Cannily spread across both screens, the default view displays your simplified park map on top and your interactive close-up park below. Laying down rides, paths, shrubbery and staff (of which you'll find a few new additions for each) is simply a matter of making your selection via the conveniently organised tabs at the bottom of the screen, then dragging and prodding appropriately. Likewise, detailed information on guests, rides and everything else can be accessed by tapping your point of inquiry, bringing all relevant information overhead. If you need to adjust your rides (whether that means speeding up, shutting down or repairing), prices in your shops or lay down routes for your staff members, a simple click switches everything to the lower screen.     However, while EA has done an excellent job of organising and presenting information, it's occasionally a shame the developer didn't go that one step further. For example, it's a pain in the arse - albeit a very small arse - to have to manually increase figures by single increments when a calculator-style interface would have sped things up no end. Likewise, it's frustrating that you can't switch off rides and visitors to get a better view of your park when laying paths and so on - although this was true for the PC original too. Evidently though, these are relatively minor quibbles and do little to detract from the incredibly addictive theme park-building on offer.   There is a more significant issue here however. For all the compulsive glee you get from micro-managing and fashioning every aspect of your park - from your choice of foliage to the number of loops in your rollercoaster - the fact that this version of Theme Park is almost 15 years old shows. More recent franchises have taken Bullfrog's basic idea and managed to craft a deeper, more fulfilling set of goals and objectives to proceedings.     Unfortunately, following the original game to a tee, progress is simply a matter of building your park up to a certain value then starting from scratch elsewhere. It's all a bit aimless and - once the admittedly significant thrill of building your own theme park wears off - it's likely you'll start to feel apathetic toward the whole thing. Adding a simple objective/reward structure to the game - attract a certain number of guests to unlock a new set of park themes, for instance - would have increased the game's longetivity significantly. Sadly, even a slightly arbitrary wireless multi-card offering, adding the ability to visit fellow Theme Park owners' creations, isn't enough to lengthen the game's appeal.Don't get us wrong though - there's a reason why Theme Park is considered a bonafide classic. Simply, that's the incredibly solid, entertaining resource management game at it's heart. In that respect, there's no faulting the job EA has done squeezing that onto the DS, incorporating some brilliant touchscreen controls in the process. What you have here is a deep, genuinely entertaining, fully-featured management sim, likely to appeal to anyone that's ever thought Cinderella's Castle would look much better with a toilet on its top. While the lack of any real goals to work toward ultimately hurts the game's longetivity, 13 years on, Theme Park should still delight and entertain old hands and newcomers alike.", "date": "Mar 14, 2007"}
