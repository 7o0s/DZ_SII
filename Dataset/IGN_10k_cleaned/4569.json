Hudson must have really scraped the bottom of the barrel to get this game into Nintendo's first volume of Famicom Mini games, because it's obviously the dud of the bunch.  That might sound a bit harsh, and to be honest the game isn't as terrible as that sounds. Star Soldier is just a basic, and uncreative vertical shooter that can't come anywhere close to Xevious, the other vertical shooter in the first batch of classic Famicom Mini reissues.  There's really not much to the design of Star Soldier; players do the standard weave-around-the-screen, blasting everything in the path. If the game stayed put on the starfield background it would have probably been better; the original designers felt the need to spruce it up with gigantic, interactive space stations with shootable girders and other structures that tend to clutter up the game screen. And since enemies (and their bullets) get lost in the clutter, the game's increasingly frustrating simply because hazards can't immediately be recognized.  That's all there is to Star Soldier. The game features the standard high score save thanks to backed-up SRAM, but it never had any two player support. It's as basic as the Famicom Mini games come. Sorry, Hudson. Time has not been as kind to your game as it has to the other nine initial games in the Famicom Mini line. Surely you must have had something better to offer Nintendo for the first batch of classic reissues?", "date": "Mar 20, 2004"}
