Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire is the 4th of 11 official installments, not including spin-offs or cross platform ports.  A turn-based strategy game created by Koei, Romance follows historical fact to the smallest detail.  Based on the events of the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms during 2nd and 3rd century C.E. China, players are charged with uniting warring kingdoms in the era of Wei, Wu and Shu.  Other than minor modifications such as ships catching fire and the ability to recruit barbarians to siege opposing leaders, the series remained true to its original focus up until the 7th installment, when RPG elements were added to the mix.  This particular incarnation of the series arrived on the SNES in 1995 and caught micro-managers and strategists by storm.   The main essence of the game is to control all of China's main cities and create one unified China.  Accomplishing this, however, is no easy feat.  There are four possible scenarios to undertake, and ruthless and cunning leaders to combat.  The country is constantly on the brink of war, and despite the necessity for attaining alliances, the only true allegiance the player has is to himself - treachery, deceit, and betrayal are commonplace.           A great feature the game boasts is the ability to create the very leaders and officers that will command the garrisons and administer the cities, and lead troops into battle in unfriendly territory.  The player can create up to 8 rulers and 100 regular officers in the design mode, to be used in the game.  Each leader and officer possesses the attributes of leadership, power, charm, intelligence, and political savvy.  The game starts by selecting a starting city and then gaining the support of local citizens, raising an army, recruiting more officers, plotting against rival leaders, and beefing up the city's defenses.   While this may sound fairly simple on the surface, the game has dozens and dozens of micro-facets that enable the player to customize the game to the utmost degree.   The game is actually in many ways quite similar to Sid Meier's Civilization.  While not as rapidly advancing through age in Romance(one turn equals one calendar year, while turns in battle are the equivalent of one month), players still must act with urgency and care; if only two officers are available to command (each officer may only commit to one command per turn), it is easy to forget to manage certain things.  For example, if the player decides to dispatch his most diplomatic and charming leader to recruit foreign officers - where one can beg, insist, request or demand that they join - if the negotiations go sour, such a skilled leader may not be able to stave off an impending invasion elsewhere.      Players must find a perfect balance between domestic and foreign affairs, as famine, revolts and locust outbreaks at home can put a major damper on the success of field and castle battles if there is no city to return to afterwards.  Engaging in battle is quite complex itself, as even before committing troops to attack or defend, the player must assign officers to draft, train (for a determined number of months - a nice touch), and arm soldiers.     So with all this micro-managing, is the game any fun?  It's probably quite obvious by now that this is quite the niche title, as most players simply won't have the patience to plot and organize and train and negotiate and maintain order and so forth.  The game is essentially one long build up, with conflicts interceding periodically.  While this keeps the gamer on the edge, it may not be quite as rewarding for some.  Graphically the game definitely shows its age, as it appears the developers spent more time developing complex AI routines and giving the player various responsibilities than rendering pretty effects.  Conversely, whilst engaging in such extensive micro-management, it is doubtful that the dedicated player even gives the slightest consideration to the game's graphical display.  But to become immersed to that level of blissful ignorance will take a special kind of gamer.  There is a ton of gameplay to be had here, far more than youd expect from the average game, let alone one released 12 years ago.  The type of gameplay to be had isnt for everyone, though.  Because the attention to every last detail takes precedence over an easily recognizable sense of accomplishment, many players may be easily frustrated.  However, for what it is, the game is great.  It allows one to be fully immersed in 2nd century China with the fate of the nation rested firmly upon ones shoulders.  The game is a micro-managers and strategists dream, and the game cannot be faulted solely because it may not appeal to everyone.  Its worth the 800 points if this (masochistic?) minutia and depth of gameplay appeals to you.  The developers sure spent a lot of time making the game as refined, deep, and responsive as it is, and they cant be knocked for their dedication to detail.", "date": "Mar 26, 2007"}
