{"name": "Harry Potter: Find Scabbers", "name_review": "Harry Potter Find Scabbers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/23/harry-potter-find-scabbers", "text": "The absence of a mobile Harry Potter game until now is pretty inexplicable. The bespectacled spectacular is half boy wizard/half cash cow, and for Warner Bros. to wait this long had me expecting Potter's mobile debut to be something special. Especially something timed relatively close to the release of the new book! So, what is Harry's task for his first wireless adventure? Play a Quidditch tournament? A wizard duel with some sorcerers? Fight off the Basilik?   Find Scabbers?!?   I dunno whose idea it was to make a Harry Potter-themed edition of Lock n' Chase, but it was one that should have been wiped off the dry erase board in the first round of narrowing game concepts.   In Harry Potter Find Scabbers, you are tasked with searching for Ron Weasley's pet rat, Scabbers. The rat scrambled around a series of mazes that are full of locked doors and beasties like spiders, or heavier heavies, like Dementors. In order to get through the doors, Potter must scoop up like-colored keys that correspond with the desired portal. The beasts can be frozen with a blast from the wand, and with the sheer number that love to converge on poor Harry at once, you'll need to keep your finger on the fire button.   The problem with Harry Potter Find Scabbers is that not only are neither of these game play concepts innovative (not that every mobile game has to push boundaries), but also they aren't very compelling either. Matching keys with doors gets old. Fast. Collecting Bertie Bott beans? Zzz.   Harry Potter Find Scabbers's game play is just so uneventful that it makes no difference if the game looks any good. The little Potter sprite is certainly identifiable and the mazes have a nice bit of color. The lack of audio is curious, though.  Harry Potter Find Scabbers isn't much fun to begin with, but when you consider the richness of the source material, the game becomes disheartening and disappointing. The license has the potential to be a major attraction on mobile, so why salt the earth by making the debut so dull and paint-by-numbers? Rent the DVD or re-read the books. That's time better spent with Harry.", "date": "Aug 23, 2005"}
