{"name": "Balloon Fight", "name_review": "Balloon Fight-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/17/balloon-fight-e", "text": "Thanks to the ~power~ of the e-Reader, actual Nintendo Entertainment System games released back in 1986 can now be reissued on super inexpensive trading cards. By scanning in each of the data strips spread across five trading cards, players literally can turn their e-Reader device into an NES cartridge.   Take to the air with balloons strapped on your back in Balloon Fight, an action game that pits players against other balloon-fitted fly-boys out to pop your latex. By landing on their balloons at a higher point, you'll take out their inflated spheres and send them falling to the ground in parachutes. You'll have to knock 'em out again in order to take them out of play. Get far into the game and there will be increasingly difficult opponents to take out...and more of them.  The game also has an additional mode where you'll fly through a scrolling map...if you touch the sides, that's it. Game over. One try to get through the whole thing...if there is an end, that is. Balloon Fight is, honestly, a blatant ripoff of Williams' own classic arcade game Joust. Which isn't a bad thing, actually, since the Joust that was made on the Game Boy Advance is so darn crappy...for five bucks you can get a much better clone of that classic Williams game. The only problem? The e-Reader NES games do not support link play...so the NES emulation will not allow two players to get into the action. A shame, because the game really took off when it was a competition against a second player. Without the two player support, the e-Reader version is much more limiting. But the single player game is a lot of fun regardless...and a recommended purchase, especially for five bucks.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
