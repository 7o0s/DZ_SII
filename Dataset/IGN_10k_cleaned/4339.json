Sorrent, one of the leading game developers in the mobile arena, has latched on to the license for their latest creation. Can the wireless sports titan squeeze out a decent game that doesn't have a jockstrap?  Features:  First-person shooter (of sorts) Scavenge gear from alien facilities Full sound effects  ALIENS: Unleashed professes to be something of a first-person shooter. And in many ways, it is a corridor blaster -- but with one slight, uh, difference: it's a static screen action game. You don't actually crawl down the hallways of alien-ravaged bases or across terrible landscapes. The action blips forward screen by screen.  Now, any reasonable cellphone gamer by now would never expect to play a FPS on this gen of handsets. They just don't have the horsepower to handle it. But a corridor blaster without motion suffers from the lack of intensity that comes from never quite knowing what's around the next corner.    However, Sorrent does the best it can to overcome the tech limitations holding back ALIENS: Unleashed by producing a very quality static screen shooter. The game looks very, very tight. The sprites of the different aliens, from the drones to the facehuggers, are well-executed. They look exactly like their movie counterparts.  While ~running~ through bases, you will encounter various aliens that must be shot up if you want to live. The action system is quite similar to what you find in Sorrent's football games. You attack by pressing corresponding number keys as soon as they flash on screen -- speed is the key to not ending up as facehugger food. Now, it sounds kinda lame in principle, yes. Pressing numbers to shoot aliens, but we counter with this: You're holding a cellphone, not a GameCube.  After surviving attacks, you recover gear that will help you in later battles. Helmets and boots provide extra armor, while bigger boom-boom, like pulse rifles and bazookas, will certainly make later battles much easier. Gear management adds a nice extra element to ALIENS: Unleashed -- there is genuine pleasure in holding the same weapons that Ridley used to tear down alien armies in the films.  ALIENS: Unleashed features a FOX-sanctioned storyline, too, that pits you in the middle of an training camp where things go, unsurprisingly, awry. The synthetic aliens you're supposed to use as clay pigeons seem to get minds of their own and start running amok. In addition, Sorrent was allowed to inject alien screams that certainly go a long way toward preserving the license. ALIENS: Unleashed was a game I actually had a hard time getting excited about. I love the license, but when I first heard how the game was handled -- pressing numbers to take down the Alein Queen? -- skepticism settled in. However, developer Amplified Games certainly upheld the Sporrent tradition for high-quality productions, and the extra effort to deliver a solid take on the ~Alien~ universe goes a long way to overcoming the ~meh~-ness of the gameplay.", "date": "Dec 16, 2003"}
