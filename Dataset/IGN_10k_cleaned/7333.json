One of these days the saying will change to include DDR. Even if the world split in half and God himself smashed each portion to oblivion, DDR would somehow still make it to store shelves somewhere in the cosmos. Perhaps it's meant to be. Whatever the case, the latest entry in the long-running and indestructible series has landed.   Konami calls the latest incarnation DDR: Supernova. It improves upon its predecessors by adding attractive game modes and polishing older ones, but the rest remains the same. Those looking for a massive overhaul will need to wait, while those new to the series will probably find it more accessible than previous games in the series. The most critical aspect, of any music game for that matter, is the song list. DDR Supernova presents an eclectic mix this time around, as it mixes the traditional J-Pop with the likes of Kelly Clarkson and Fall Out Boy.    Whether this makes it a better game is entirely up to the individual. If you prefer ~Do you want to~ by Franz Ferdinand to ~Peace~ by BeForU, then this change will definitely delight your feet and ears. But if you find yourself leaning toward the J-Pop front, then the latest DDR title may seem a little tarnished, or even watered down. Of course, it also has its share of songs that transcend most tastes, if only for the time it takes to dance your way to victory. David Bowie's ~Let's Dance~ has limited appeal in a game of this type, but in the end, it works just fine. Other tracks, such as Paul Van Dyks ~The Other Side~, fit better than most and will garner more attention.  You dance to all of these songs through SuperNova's different game modes. Fans of the series will recognize a bulk of them, as Konami carried over most from the last iteration. Still, it did so for a reason: they have mass appeal. You can still try to lose weight by playing through Workout mode, for instance. You program your current weight and goal weight, choose what songs you want to sweat to and go at it. Nothing better to get those lady friends playing, huh? For those DDR virgins out there, the game includes Training mode. It helps you find your footing by teaching you the myriad steps needed to conquer the game. You can also rock to Advanced mode, which has a few options for expert players. It also hosts a multiplayer Battle option where two dancers can actually ~fight~ each other by dancing well.   The coolest addition in all of SuperNOVA deals with the single-player mode. It's called Stellar Master Mode and it actually gives the title something of a campaign. You actually need to dance your way through several ~joints~, which look a lot like planets floating out in space. Each joint or planet has a series of dance-centric tasks to complete. Once you finish them, you move on to the next joint and so on. You eventually partake in dance showdowns, which act somewhat like boss encounters. If you complete them successfully, you move on down the line of joints. It's actually a fun mode, if only because it actually feels like an honest-to-goodness addition to the game, as opposed to the enhancement of a mode already in place.   Fans of the DDR series will find a lot to like in DDR SuperNOVA. Only they've liked the same stuff for several years now. Enhancements abound, but most will fail to grab the attention of diehard fans or those who never bothered with the series. The coolest addition, Stellar Master Mode, adds some depth and variety, but it would have been nice to see it as part of a family of new modes. Instead, it's the only one that really feels any different. In the end, the old DDR formula works well, but it feels irrefutably tired. Again.", "date": "Oct 10, 2006"}
