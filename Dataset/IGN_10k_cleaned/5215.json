PC gaming is full of deadly serious games, from Call of Duty, to Rome: Total War to Max Payne, so running into something like Scrapland is like finding a balloon artist at a wake. Like all good humor, it's more than just funny lines or goofy-looking creatures. It's also about situations and slightly subversive overtones.  The story opens up with D-Tritus entering Chimera, an all-robot asteroid, and looking for work. All the good jobs are taken, though, and he has to settle for being a lowly journalist. He quickly unearths a murder mystery that will have him risking life and limb on his way to a heroic finish.  But how does a robot get murdered? There's the Great DataBase, where the matrix of every person is saved for retrieval in case of an accident, so everyone should be safe. However, someone is stealing the matrices themselves from the GDB, and D-Tritus has to figure out who, because he might be next in line. Early on, he'll gain the ability to hack the GDB and change into virtually any type of character, and he'll need this ability to complete certain missions from time to time, as some of them have unique abilities. However, Beholder robots, little flying security guards, patrol and scan everyone, and they can catch you in someone else's skin and call the guards, who will blow you to bits.  Since you're in the GDB, all is not lost, of course, but you only have a limited number of extra lives. You can buy more from a GDB bishop, three for a thousand credits, but if you run out, the game is over and you have to go back to your last save point. In fact, since you can save anywhere, the extra life design feels unnecessary--more appropriate for the consoles.  D-Tritus will also be able to ~over-write~ someone, which basically means walking up to them and replacing them where they stand. This can be a quicker way than finding a GDB station, but it also counts as murder and will alert all police in the vicinity. When you trip an alarm, you'll have a meter that has to go all the way back down before the heat is off, like in Metal Gear Solid. The Beholders also have a similar cone of awareness. For the most part, though, it's pretty easy to escape the fuzz. While in flight, however, the police are a lot better at tracking you, and there's enough of them flying so that you often run into another just as you're about to lose the first guy.    The flight model is actually quite well thought out, and you can tell the devs have played plenty of dogfighting and racing games, particularly Wipeout with a little Winf Commander for good measure. The outdoor environments are also pretty damn awesome, with a keen eye on making everything larger than life. Imagine Blade Runner meets The Fifth Element and you'll be pretty close, although MercurySteam makes an effort to integrate organic objects into the mix. It's not just all shiny skyscrapers and roads in the sky. You'll fly through the Scrapyard, which is a huge ship cemetery shot through with cave tunnels, warrens, husks of enormous vessels, and hornet-like nests of little flying robots who don't take too kindly to you getting to close to their hives. Then there's the spot where the GDB itself is housed, and that's just fantastic.      The art style is varied, imaginative, and rivals World of Warcraft for sheer personality. Light fixtures are given the subtle ~bloom~ treatment you may recall in Tron 2.0, where the edges are fuzzy and natural. Sound also gets high marks, with extensive and professional voice acting across the board, a host of cool sound effects, and a polished, techno-oriented soundtrack that kicks in dynamically.  But getting back to flying. The story here is upgradeability and modification. Over time, you stumble upon or be granted plans for ship types, weapons, and engines. You can cobble together something pretty mean after a while, and customize it so that you can maximize certain aspects while saving money elsewhere. For example, you may find yourself using the cluster missiles and chaingun a lot, but then you find the Devastator and Tesla guns. Suddenly, the old weapons aren't so neat. Well, go ahead and remove them, and add another rocket instead. Each ship type comes with a preset allotment of hardpoints and weight allowance, and each weapon type is further broken down into a maximum number of slots it can occupy. Weapons also have partially tracking reticules, and the swarming missiles have a quick image recognition lock. Oh, and the weapons are pretty powerful. Every major area in Chimera has a shop where you can tweak your ride.  Your first ship, practically a loaner, will only have a couple slots for swarm missiles, and a chain gun mount, but not much else. But eventually you'll have a beast that can mount multiples of pretty much everything. Interestingly, the order in which you find engine upgrades is a little disorganized, and the secretly-lain plans of a few high-end items are accessible virtually from the moment you begin the game. It doesn't necessarily detract from gameplay, but the design here isn't as strong as it could be. Further, the upgrade interface isn't completely intuitive. It took me a while to figure out how to build upon a different ship type, and took me longer to figure out that I could put different types of rocket engines on multiple mounts. The heavier the ship is, the slower it moves, naturally. The more armor you put on it, the longer it will take for your afterburner boost to bring you to full speed.  So far so good. The flight and combat model, while on the twitchy side, is solid and fun, with lots of eye candy effects giving you the sensation of speed, rollicking explosions, and super science weapons. Inertia on the heavy ships makes it difficult to get through the racing segments easily, but your hangar of sorts has plenty of space for multiple vessels. You'll also have a R2-D2 kind of buddy who'll be able to summon your ship to any parking space in the game--provided it hasn't been destroyed in combat.    This is the rub, because reconstructing your ship costs the full price you paid to begin with, and that can get mighty expensive. Money isn't hard to come by in Scrapland, and man, it can go just as quickly. Considering how easy it is to get your ship blown to itty bits, it would be nice to be able to get the ship back for a reduced price, or buy extra lives for it like you can for yourself. Many times I found myself stealing a vessel and flying that instead of risking my precious and expensive beast.   It's not necessarily that the weapons in Scrapland are powerful--it's that it's really difficult to shake somebody. Every weapon comes with a potentially useful countermeasure--something you can drop behind you to frustrate or damage the enemy--but there isn't a lot of speed delta from one ship to another, and the afterburner only gives you a one-shot burst of speed followed by a recharge phase, instead of steady velocity. Every location is scattered with ~speed gates~ so to speak--thresholds appearing as a ring or short tunnel that traffic is flowing through--and those apparently increase your speed and keep it there until you bump into something or thrust sideways or in reverse. These are handy for getting away from people or for quickly reaching scattered targets, and it's also fun to go fast.      But one of the player-friendly things about Scrapland is that you don't have to fly all the time anyway to get from point A to point B. The whole asteroid has a subway system that will take you to almost all the major locations in a little more time than it takes to load the area, which isn't long at all on a reasonably powerful gaming rig.  Unfortunately, MercurySteam appears to have applied the ~larger than life~ idea to these on-foot locations. From the police station to city hall to your press building, these places are just too darn big. There's a lot of just plain running around to find someone, who's usually deep within the complex. They're marked on your compass, so there's almost always easy to find, but it's kind of a hassle when you have to run all the way over to them, talk, then find your way out again. There aren't any side missions to stumble on, interesting conversations to have, or cool and useful items to pick up (aside from the occasional hidden plan), so it just feels tedious, especially when you do a lot of communication with a video phone.  Here's a rule: when I have a phone, I want to be able to use it when I want to simply call someone instead of physically tracking them down. People are always calling me in Scrapland, so I end up feeling like a bit of a gofer, particularly when these face-to-face conversations almost always end up with me having to perform a few tasks before I can gain some information that will allow me to continue the investigation. The denizens seem particularly paranoid, since these missions they make me do are almost always a way of proving my trustworthiness and invariably involve making a hit on somebody or blowing up some vessels.  In fact, when you think about, D-Tritus is a pretty chipper guy for all the death and destruction he leaves in his wake. I would have much sooner had the bulk of these missions converted to optional side quests, because there's a lot of ~before I can talk to this guy, I gotta do this thing that will allow me to get in here so I can get this item that will convince this guy to talk to me so that I can yadda yadda yadda.~  Scrapland has a highly imaginative, shiny and charming art style, plenty of humor, and a hefty amount of play time, but it would have benefited from making the on-foot locations quite a bit smaller and from reducing the amount of required combat. Chimera is a very open environment where you can just bomb around, cause havoc and steal ships, but you won't stumble across any additional game content, even though the design is ripe for it. There also isn't as much mission variety as there could be.   I know the potential is there because there were some cool segments where I had to race someone else to hunt down a certain number of items, and a few escort/defend missions, and some fun racing. The flag hunt and deathmatch modes are present in multiplayer, in addition to team deathmatch and CTF, and you'll get to play them in areas taken from the game, which is cool, but I would have liked to have seen more variety and lateral flexibility in the single-player.", "date": "Nov 4, 2004"}
