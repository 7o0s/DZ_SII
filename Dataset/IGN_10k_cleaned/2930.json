{"name": "Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix", "name_review": "Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/17/soldier-of-fortune-ii-double-helix", "text": "Not content with laboring as a professional whittler, leather tender, or postman like most gritty and surly middle-aged men of his type, John Mullins, the hero in our tale, likes the action, and lots of it. A mercenary by trade, Mullins hires himself out to the highest bidder with intentions of quelling threats P.C. governments might not be able to handle by traditional means. This involves mucho killing. Primarily, his discretely delivered and tax free paycheck currently comes from ~The Shop,~ a very secretive, technologically advanced, and in-the-know consortium of vicious do-gooders who will go to no end to protect their beloved United States. Hell yeah!  What begins as a simple VIP rescue in Prague many years ago quickly escalates into something bigger, badder, and potentially far more deadly. Chemical warfare is the name of the game, and somebody is already unleashing this new plague in small doses that obliterate entire villages. Go in, kick ass, kill everyone, and try and find out what's going on, if there's time.  Not nearly as pretentious as the long-winded and heavy-handed Metal Gear Solid, Soldier of Fortune II doesn't attempt to cram down hours of pointless prattle designed to convey some tripe moral insight someone once had while eating a sandwich on the toilet. (~Cloning is bad! I'll make a game!~) And if it did, that thankfully got lost in the shuffle. No, Soldier of Fortune II's story is one of an action film. It uses real world settings, premises, and matters of concern to create immediacy and intensity. It's important to find out what's going on in order to discover who's behind it all so that he can be promptly murdered, thus saving the innocent children of America, and I suppose other countries. Simple, to the point, and pleasantly delivered, it's like a James Bond film, but without all the glitz and pointlessness. Ever wondered why Bond didn't just go and murder Dr. No? Clearly he's no good. Just shoot him already and save the time. Why play the charade? Soldier of Fortune II follows this ideology, only it's necessary to get to the point before the shooting begins. I don't want to give away more of the plot, so I'll leave with, ~Talk about finding bad. Find bad. Kill bad. Talk about finding next bad. Kill him too.~ No frills, but plenty of thrills. Besides, this rather long game has got the Joker himself, Mark Hamill, in it.    This is an action game -- a straight up first person shooter. Anyone can then see the problem: this type of title can become redundant. Recognizing this, Raven attempted to solve the problem by implementing two fundamentally different play styles to augment the straight running and gunning. In come stealth and on-rails shooting. The latter is for the most part done well. Naturally the vast exteriors scrolling by at blinding speeds aren't going to look nearly as good as the articulated buildings and bases of SoF II, but they run fast enough and are scripted well enough to be entertaining. Later on into the game some pretty exciting rides occur, delivering on exactly what they were designed to do: break up play and add diversity.  The problem is with the ~Stealth~ missions. Like Elite Force and Red Faction, they are poorly developed afterthoughts that actually hamper play and frustrate more than please. I detest instant failures and trial and error. I absolutely abhor that kind of copout gameplay, and Soldier of Fortune II has some of it, enough anyway to displease me and dissuade those with tempers and egos. See, me and you, we're real gamers. When we see a bunch of difficulty settings, we skip right over the first two (sissy and pansy, respectively) and pick one from the harder settings (normal to us is hard for everyone else, and then there's our, ~I have no life and will play until my eyes bleed,~ which of course equates to ~don't even try it~ for everyone else). But playing like we do means contending with limited saves, and in trial and error situations, this thoroughly sucks.  In most of the stealth missions, the second someone spies Mullins, or is in anyway alerted to his presence (uncovering a corpse, pistol whipped foe awakening, camera capturing his image, etcetera) the alarm sounds and the quick load button gets depressed. If the game doesn't just flat out fail the mission and force a restart, the insanity that ensues most definitely won't be survived. Think endless streams of heavily armed evil punks. You heard me, this happens the instant he is uncovered. No running to push an alarm button, no hesitation, no phone call to the superiors... Instant alarm. Forcing players to go stealth and then punishing them so harshly when they are uncovered is just wrong.   Dare I say it, this game may actually be better than Medal of Honor. In-view weapon sounds are generally solid, the conversations of bad guys are in their appropriate languages, and the dynamic music ranges from joy to unobtrusive. The real coolness comes from bullet impacts, ricochets, stellar positional audio, and weapon effects that, depending on range, vary in tone and intensity. A far off gunshot may sound like a low muffle whereas one closer to damaging Mullins' frail moustache will shatter eardrums. The end result is near brilliance. Only some scruffy acting mars the experience.   And this singer can dance. When not being sneaky or stuck in the back of a truck, the combat is frantic, fast, intense, and highly enjoyable thanks largely to the new AI algorithms.  Not keenly aware of every move made, the enemies are certainly not blessed with the Spidey sense that also urges them to rush whenever possible. Guards under fire will retreat, work in seemingly coordinated packs, peek around corners, and even be met with a shotgun round to the back if they happen to look the wrong way. It's not uncommon to carry on actual distance firefights with groups of dauntless guards across the way. In these cases, jumping behind strategically and meticulously placed cover, moving to safer positions, and waiting patiently as they turn the corner, expecting to find you one way, but meeting your shells from the other, can be a real blast in more ways than one.   Characters behind crates and around the bends of walls (perhaps the result of some sloppy scripting that also cause enemies to spawn illogically) will occasionally vainly shoot at the obstructing object in front of them, not knowing the importance of aiming their weapon away from the wall in order to hit the enemy, but other than that, Soldier of Fortune II is a lovely effort, provided the difficulty is set above sissy.   And on to the swimsuits... Yes, Soldier of Fortune II is a looker. It can really chop up in some levels but then will run beautifully in others. My advice would be to respect the automatic configuration, turn off anisotropic filtering and vertical sync and then crank the resolution a bit, provided the graphics card employed can handle it.  Aside from choppy idle animations (the shotgun spin), the game is aesthetically amazing. Character models are assembled with a startling number of polygons, come accentuated with crisp, surreal texturing, move fluidly, die fluidly, and even do their best not to clip into the surrounding environment when many bullets hit them. Coolness!  Environments, in and out, are also wonderfully detailed, drawn, and textured. The flora in some of the levels really adds something appreciable to the game, as does SoF II's weather effects (rain on a boat is scientifically described as ~yum~). But then when glass shatters it doesn't look as good as Red Faction! Clearly, this game sucks.  And then there was the violence.  Yes, shooting people in different places with different weapons can be very disturbing. Hands, feet, shins, legs, chunks of bodies, chunks of faces, chunks of heads, halves of bodies, chunky blood splats, decapitation, squirting holes, gaping wounds, bone fragments, brain globs... I could go on for some time. But honestly, after the novelty wears off the graphic violence becomes more of a subconsciously appreciated graphical touch than something that's required. It's nice to be able to mutilate a pesky guard, but it's also nice that the focus of Soldier of Fortune II is clearly on intense combat and not shattered skulls.   Still, the game is not for children, even with the parental lockouts.   After all this visceral singleplayer is thoroughly enjoyed, there awaits a rather robust online and LAN component, but it comes with limited maps and no bots. Different from the singleplayer's random mission generator that drops players into actual levels with goals and easily defeated AI opponents, the random map generator of the multiplayer mode is a bit useless. Cool in premise, it simply isn't as good as the Raven developed multiplayer maps, but then nor would it ever be. Those actually developed ones were carefully labored on for months, while each random map is generated in a minute and is entirely outdoors. An awesome step in the right direction? Absolutely. But that's all it is -- a step. Other than that, multiplayer Soldier of Fortune is fun and appealing. More maps would be sweet, but what's there is a blessing, because at one point there was to be no multiplayer at all.   About the Macintosh version Buy as much RAM as you can afford and get the best video card you can find because this game is DEMANDING! Running on a 733 with a GeForce 2 this game was ch--p-p-yyy, even with everything turned off! If you have anything less that a G4 500 and 256 MB or RAM, I would consider buying a different game, despite the what the system requirements say.  The PC version of SoF II was riddled with bugs that our friends at IGN PC found quite disturbing. I'm pleased to say that a lot of them (but not all) have been remedied in the Mac version. No hangs or crashes at all. The title is OS X only, so I was able to create a shell script to quit the finder when kicking off a game and the result was a slightly faster, more responsive and delightfully stable play experience.  Multiplayer gaming works wonderfully on a local network or over the internet. Mac users can get it on with their PC adversaries as well.  We here at IGN Mac play on Radeon cards and SoF II looked stunning on our test machine running an 8500. Colors, reflections and details were all spectacular and the frame rate on our 733 was bumped up pretty dramatically over the stock NVIDIA card.  Overall, the Mac port of this title by MacPlay is awesome. The guys here in the office haven't been able to stop playing it since we got our copies. The last really spectacular game we played was MOH:AA and I have to admit that I'm pretty hard pressed to make a call as to which one is better. If you're looking for your next FPS fix and want a really, really good game, look no further.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
