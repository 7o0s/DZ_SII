First, there's the arcade fishing game that's all about catching fish -- lots and lots of fish, and, in many cases, really big fish. Natsume's Reel Fishing II isn't that kind of a fishing videogame. Reel Fishing II falls in the class of fishing games that are more of a simulation of the entire fishing experience rather than the simple tug-of-war between man and fish. The actual reeling in of the fish is only a very small fraction of the entire experience in these types of games.   Gameplay If you're looking for a quick, arcade fishing experience, then just stop reading this review right now. This is definitely NOT the game for you. If you're not hardcore into fishing and fishing videogames, then you'll probably be bored out of your mind playing Reel Fishing II. The main reason for this is because it's insanely difficult and it takes more skill just to hook a fish in this game than to catch a few dozen large mouthed bass in other fishing games.   Reel Fishing II is only for the diehard fisherman that wants to try and get the same fishing experience that he can get on the lake in the comfort of his home. Because, just like in real-life fishing, you aren't guaranteed to get a fish to bite every few seconds in this fishing game. Successfully catching fish in Reel Fishing II requires an enormous amount of patience in addition to knowing how to correctly ~hook~ a fish, use the right lure, know where to cast, and performing the right techniques in the right area. All of which are also integral parts in determining your success at catching fish in this hardcore simulation.   Assuming that you have the intestinal fortitude and willingness to deal with being unsuccessful at catching fish for extended periods of time, Reel Fishing II will actually prove to be one hell of a good game playing experience. There's not another fishing game out there that offers the insane amount of depth that you can get here. Complete with over 70 different types of fish, over 500 pieces of tackle, and four different types of fishing methods, players are given an endless amount of play value. Just perfecting the technique of fly-fishing can take up an entire weekend without much thought.   Whether using standard digital or analog control pads, or one of the licensed fishing controllers for PlayStation, the player is given a tremendous amount of control over the fishing experience. Everything from the speed of the reeling in of the fish, to the depth of the lure, and the distance of the cast is completely in the control of the player and is easily done with simple button presses or movements with the fishing controller. The only aspect of control lacking is that players are unable to move around their boat, as the gameplay area is limited to a flat FMV background instead of a full roaming 3D environment. While you can choose where to cast in these particular areas, you lose some of the fun of riding around a lake trying to find a special fishing spot.   Graphics The majority of the visuals in Reel Fishing II are comprised of static FMV backgrounds. On the positive side, it means that the water and various background environments are some of the most realistic that you'll see in a fishing game on PlayStation. There are some artifacts with the full-motion video but not any more or less than what you've come to expect with PlayStation.   In addition to the FMV, the game does have some underwater environments that are made up of polygonal fish and background objects. For the most part, these are very bland and suffer from the typical pop-up and clipping problems that seem to be significant in any game that involves underwater environments.   Sound Whether you go with the soft orchestral music or just the ambient background sounds, the audio in this game provides one of the most relaxing and calming effects that you could ever get in a videogame. The soft sounds help soothe your soul and the various water sounds and environmental audio effects make you believe that you're out on a fishing boat on a nice, cool summer morning.  You really have to love fishing and fishing games in order to enjoy this one. This isn't your typical fishing title where you can catch fish like crazy -- it takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, and quite a bit of skill to catch even a single fish in this game. In some respects, catching fish in Reel Fishing II is even harder than in real life. Because in real life, it's possible to catch fish, quite easily I might add, without really knowing how to fish correctly. A few years back, when Reagan was just starting his second term as President of the United States, my brother and I went out and caught in excess of 100 fish between us during a span of about 12 hours -- neither of us being master fisherman. We were throwing each of them back in, so we probably caught the same ones quite a few times, but doing that same thing in Reel Fishing II would be impossible. The game is really hard and requires more patience and skill than most people will be willing to put into it. On the other hand, if you're a player that is looking for this kind of a challenge in a fishing game and would prefer sitting there for a few minutes just waiting for a fish to bit, rather than catching five or six fish per minute, then Reel Fishing II is a great game. There's an enormous amount of depth and will of the fish, lures, and options available, it will provide the tolerant player with an endless amount of gameplay. It's only for those that can stomach the frustration of going out and not easily catching the fish, though.", "date": "Aug 5, 2000"}
