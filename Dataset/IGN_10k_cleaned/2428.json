I saw the movie on a cross-country flight last summer, and if I could have walked out on the flick, I would have. Plot, dialogue and acting aside, Driven's overall situation does offer a few nifty ideas for a videogame...and Crawfish Interactive worked with what they had to build on the film license. But you honestly can't blame the name of the game for some of the design issues in the game. The development team looks like it wanted to offer a fast-paced, semi-realistic racing game, sprinkled with a handful of over-the-top elements from the flick...but it's not a great marriage. The designers should have moved the dial all the way to the ~extreme~ side of the switch. The final product is an OK racer, but it could have been so much better if a lot more flair was introduced to the game engine. Features: A full Story Championship mode, plus Arcade, Test, and Muliple Race modes Race as a team, with a blocker and a leader crisscrossing the field Unlock cars and tracks with your Championship wins Be part of one of six teams, each with its own strengths on the track Four player racing with one-cart downloaded Link Play Only for Game Boy Advance   Let's push the whole love triangle story thing right out the window. The interesting bits of Driven the movie were the actual race portions...and even that went a bit over the top for what actually happens in the Formula One circuit. But that's okay, amplify that into larger portions and it should make for a pretty wild videogame right? Well...it should, anyway. Crawfish's started with a great foundation: an R/C Pro Am style game engine. The perspective is fixed at an angle above the vehicles so you can see all around your vehicle...plus the Game Boy Advance has a tough time with true 3D graphics, and we already have a glut of Mode 7-style behind-the-vehicle racers, thank you very much.   The sprite-based engine is a bit more friendly to what the Game Boy Advance can do, and the development team put together a decent one with a bit more life than usual. For example, if you look closely at the front of your car,  you'll see that the front wheels actually turn independently from the chassis...it wasn't necessary, but the programmers did it anyway. But this detail comes at a cost, and the game unfortunately takes a performance hit when more than a couple cars are zooming on-screen. It does get noticeably choppy and slower...and what's worse is that there's so many sprites on-screen that the engine has a difficult time determining which object should take priority. You'll see some sprites go under others when they shouldn't, and occasionally you'll see buildings, crowds, and road objects glitch out into a mess of random pixels every once in a while. It's not the cleanest programming job out there.  There are several modes of play in Driven, all of which revolve around the Driven racing racing engine. It's a race around eight tracks against a pack of eleven other vehicles...and of course, you'll want to come in at the highest position possible. Your car can take damage, so it's all about clean driving...otherwise you'll find yourself flipped in the air and pile of scorched metal shattered on the track. And that's a costly time penalty. If you make it around the track unscathed, you can find yourself ~in the zone~ like in the movie...your car turns into a flaming streak of a fireball, earning a much higher top speed, completely repaired and totally untouchable from the opposition.   The movie elements come into play in Story Mode...you'll have to run ~challenges~ that follow the plot of the movie, including a race through downtown areas, passing dangerously close to conveniently parked 18-wheelers. And if you're one of the few folks that has actually seen the movie, yep, there's even a level where you'll have to collect three coins sitting on the track. This mode is important to the Driven license, but in all honesty it feels like it's been tacked on as an afterthought. The ~cutscenes~ are simple text screens with a small, drawn portrait of one of the characters from the flick. No digitized snapshots from the movie, and no Sly Stallone. And even though this game has a battery, you can't save the Story Mode in the middle of the action...what's up with that?  When compared to other racing games using a similar engine, Driven's controls don't feel as tight, nor does the gameplay offer any sort of rush. The problem is that the designers fail to exaggerate the action beyond the occasional car explosion and the ~in the zone~ fireball streak -- the car is pretty glued to the track otherwise. Don't expect wild powerslide or spin-outs, which is unfortunate since these cars really should be wildly whipping around the track. It honestly feels like the cars are on rails as they head around the curves, assisting you in getting your vehicle pointed in the right direction. It doesn't seem to matter if you take a turn slow or fast, since it'll turn at the same rate regardless of your vehicle's speed. Some cars will fishtail if you over-compensate trying to drive in a straight line, but that's just not enough challenge to keep racing fans happy.  On the plus side, the game features link play for up to four players...and anyone can take advantage of this since there's a mode where all you need is a single cartridge. Of course, if you want to play around with all the tracks in the game, you'll need a cartridge per system...but it's great to see third-party developers learning the multi-boot function of the GBA.  This game could have been the RC Pro Am for the Game Boy Advance.  But a game design that's not sure what it's trying to be keeps the game from ending up as good as it should have been. It's a great first shot with this engine...but I highly suggest Crawfish work to make the game a bit more ~wild.~ Because that would have made Driven loads more enjoyable.", "date": "Jan 16, 2002"}
