Acclaim continues the tradition with the release of Burnout, a visually improved and control-tweaked port of the PlayStation 2 version that released November 2001. It's an arcade racer through and through, and is a markedly different experience for Xbox' still growing next-generation system. The Criterion-developed racer pits you in vehicles and environments reminiscent of the real world. Burnout brings gamers on the edges of their seats, and sends them rocketing down four-lane highways into oncoming traffic at 60 frames per second. Featuring an unprecedented sense of speed, tight control, and addictive gameplay mechanics, Burnout is more than worth a look for racing fans. Only its longevity, lack of extra polish, and arcade influence may turn would-be buyers away.   Features  Drive dangerously -- force traffic into your opponent's path and risk a head-on collision to secure a win Slide, cut close and drive into oncoming traffic and you'll be rewarded for your risk-taking Impressive crash replays, based on realistic damage physics  Blaze a trail through 14 US and European themed courses Tracks are massive, featuring traffic at every turn and diverse territory Advanced artificial intelligence makes Burnout fun to play even alone After the race, check out your best crashes in instant replay mode where you can control the camera, add motion blur, and zoom in Tight analog control works brilliantly with the Xbox controller Intense two-player mode Supports Dolby 5.1 True 16:9 widescreen mode, so videophiles with compatible TVs can see more of the courses Progressive scan HDTV support lets you play Burnout in 720p (yes 720p) for a sharp, vibrant display   Gameplay Burnout is an arcade racer developed by Criterion, the same company responsible for the widely used RenderWare game engine.  Burnout's basic formula is simple: risk equals reward. And, to that same accord, the more risks you take, the more exponential your rewards will be. The risks include driving head-on into oncoming traffic, glancing by other autos for near misses, and drifting for extended periods of times around corners. By performing and combining these risky driving methods you can gain boost, which fills a yellow bar located in the lower-left corner of your screen. You won't have access to this turbo boost until it's completely full. Crashing depletes some of the amount you've earned, creating for a suspenseful driving environment. If you successfully manage to fill the boost meter you will be able to draw upon a nitrous-type effect and turbo past the competition.    The sense of speed is incredible, but the chance of crashing becomes all the more likely -- something you don't want to do after you've built up all that turbo. Lose it and you can kiss that boost goodbye. Successfully use all the turbo without crashing and you'll have performed a ~burnout,~ the very core of the gameplay design. That said, crashes play a very big part in Burnout. There are lavish replay sequences that force you to watch your crash take place from numerous angles. In the meantime, you may see the opposition pass you during the replay. There's no way to skip through these, and the point of that is due to the fact that since the crash takes time to take place your opponents will catch-up. There's no way avoiding it.       This is where the depth of Burnout comes into play. You're not just managing corners, working with the simulation element of driving vehicles around twisting streets. You spend a lot of time trying to build your burnout meter and avoiding crashes, so you can keep up with the competition. Combining drifts with near misses and driving into oncoming traffic earns you turbo more quickly. The first time you get two burnouts in a row, it's an adrenaline rush. This is where the break-neck speed and control come together beautifully, making the experience all the more worthwhile.   Burnout features several modes including Championship which sends you across locales based on European and US locations; Single player mode to practice the tracks you've raced in previously; Head-to-Head pits you in two-player races against friends and CPU opponents if you wish; Time Attack lets you practice without the threat of CPU; and, Special where you can indulge in secret modes you've unlocked. Championship mode is the biggest draw, as you'll be racing, usually, in three-race competitions. It's a bit tricky as you have to place in a predetermined spot or higher. You don't get points for your placing. This can be pretty difficult later into the circuits, but will definitely bring you even closer to the edge of your seat when you're fighting headlight-to-bumper for first place with the impressive AI CPU drivers. The mode is well designed, but lacks enough unique courses to keep things fresh. There are about six unique locations, and a total of 14 tracks thanks to the use of night courses and different routes. It actually works quite well due to the massive size of each track. Laps can take anywhere from three minutes to upwards of seven, which you'll experience on one of the marathon courses. Let us tell you, putting yourself through an 18-minute race against oncoming traffic and smart CPU drivers is intense.   As you move through the Championship you will unlock special match-ups under the Face Off mode. Basically cars can be unlocked by defeating the CPU driver of the vehicle in a head-to-head racer. You don't race through any new tracks, but there's something about taking on just one AI racer instead of four that feels a bit different. You'll also open up something called the Free Run mode, which leaves the highways and byways devoid of all traffic so you can race solely against the CPU drivers. The idea is that you're not crashing every 30 seconds and successfully burning out more. In these modes the AI actually improves because it's not processing all the oncoming traffic and frequent crashes.     If you pay close attention to the AI, it's easy to see that it's quite impressive. The cars handle naturally and anything like computers. Just like you they will swerve off the road, crash frequently, and misjudge turns only to scrape against a wall. As aforementioned, you can see this at its best in Free Run. They react more to you as a driver instead of driving some pre-programmed line. For example, you go to swerve into them to push them off your side a bit and you find that they swerve before you hit them. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it's like the CPU is ~seeing~ you and reacting. This, of course, happens in the Championship races and is also very random. It gives it a very natural feel, creating for a compelling race environment instead of getting tired of the classic perfect CPU drivers you see so often.   Overall, Burnout can be described as a stirring arcade racer with tight controls and a stylish concept. The title delivers break-neck speed racing with an edgy twist that encourages recklessness over perfection. And, let's face it, when you're breaking the speed limit so excessively there's plenty of other rules you'll want to bend. Burnout lets you do that and rewards you for it. This much is very entertaining, but it's very apparent that Burnout is a ~first-of~ type title. After you polish up on your technique, you can get through Burnout without too much effort. It's certainly not easy, and we know of plenty who find it tough.      In the end, Burnout tries to target both ends of the spectrum. Simulation veterans can explore the depth of getting big drifts and earning more boost for impressive lap speeds, while amateur race fans can enjoy taking things at their own pace and still complete the game with enough effort.   For extra replay value Burnout comes equipped with a dandy two player mode, which is very fun with two skilled drivers, and something called ~Survival~ mode where try to make it through an entire race without crashing. In truth, it has more ~hardcore~ value than it does ~replay,~ because you won't be unlocking any stunning extras -- it's mostly a dare for drivers who have something to prove. Even with all this, though, it's missing that extra polish that would have made it truly amazing. For starters, random weather effects would have made a huge difference.  A number of extra tracks and more cars would have definitely helped too. In the end, the core gameplay of Burnout is great, but much like a fine automobile it needs all the extras and upgrades to make it more valuable.   Graphics Burnout does a number of things very well visually. Above all it retains and, in fact, proudly touts a rock-solid 60 frames per second framerate. For the sense of speed there can be no other alternative, and it rarely falters to a lower framerate. At first glance you'll note that the car models are none too impressive, and modest at best. Things such as the rims are modeled, but they lack the detail you see in something like Gran Turismo. Of course, there's a very big difference in Burnout in that you're racing in the midst of a constant stream of traffic. There aren't just four AI-controlled drivers trailing along with you. There are dozens of vehicles -- also composed of a modest number of polygons -- around every corner, and as aforementioned the framerate will not stutter. As well, this all takes place under the cover of gaping cities and expansive mountainside environments. The tracks are quite diverse, wrapping through tight city corners and opening up onto the mountainside. Load times in this regard are stunning. It's a short four or five second load with no delays.   Also striking is that Criterion proves its RenderWare engine is quite powerful. Burnout, thanks to all the traffic, level geometry, and blazing framerate is probably pushing upwards of 10-12 million polygons a second. The company demonstrates that if you use its tools correctly, the benefits can be numerous. Burnout features soft and moody real-time lighting and realistic texture design, giving the entire world a true-to-life appearance. It's definitely not the most realistic racer we've seen, but for its speedy framerate it excels visually.     Sound Burnout does a great job utilizing Xbox' 5.1 capabilities.  Only in 5.1 can you hear oncoming traffic wizz by.  There's not a lot going on behind you, except when your competitors near.  Then you will hear the roar of their engine, adding to the tension.  When you bust out your boost, you'll hear your heart thumping in your chest.  The music never rises to meet this tension, always staying low in the background.  It was an artistic choice to keep the score almost inaudible.  It flitters quietly in the background, completely antithetical to other racing game soundtracks.  This is, it seems, an attempt to heighten the sounds of the round.  And it works effectively.  If you don't care for this muted soundtrack, you won't be able to do a thing about it.  Customized soundtracks are not allowed in Burnout, which is a real shame.  The best of the sounds comes with crashes.  The squeal of tires trying to hang on to the black top, the bang of impact, the shattering of windows, work in perfect conjunction with the vibration of the controller and stunning visuals.    So far the majority of Xbox titles have done a poor job properly using Dolby 5.1.  Burnout is not on that list.  A solid use of sound, though the softened score fails to add to the experience. I had toyed around with Burnout just a little on the PlayStation 2. And, when I say a little, I mean, like, a few minutes. I just wanted to see what was at its surface. Of course, when the Xbox version came into the offices I gave it my full attention, as it stood out from the other racers on the system. After I looked past its exterior I saw there was enough depth to overshadow the highly arcadey elements such as the constant checkpoints. Burnout is about more than just racing around the same lap three times. The challenge is always different because you're racing through heavy traffic performing near misses and drifting at every available opportunity. It's entirely another layer to the game when you dig into it, and anyone who overlooks it isn't giving it a chance.  That said, I highly recommend Burnout to those looking for a solid racer to own on Xbox. A dedicated gamer can beat Burnout in a weekend's time, so only purchase it if you're planning on enjoying the well-done two-player mode and unlocking the extra goodies like the extra vehicles. All in all, I really found myself wishing that Burnout had dynamic weather effects, more cars, and some extra polish. If it had, I'm confident Burnout would be one of the better arcade racers -- not just on Xbox -- but all systems.Give me a totally fleshed out sequel Criterion, and I'll be very happy.", "date": "Apr 30, 2002"}
