That said, don't be turned off by Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance on the handheld, because you'll be missing out on one of the most fun, impressive, and thoroughly designed fighters to hit the Game Boy Advance. Features 12 playable characters Dozens of secrets Statistic and Kurrency tracking Cartridge save (three slots) Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridges) Only for Game Boy Advance  The Mortal Kombat series of fighters gained notoriety through its use of real, digitized actors and over-the-top violence. Though the series shifted dramatically in Mortal Kombat 4 by ousting the actors and moving into 3D, the blood and gore stayed. Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is the first Mortal Kombat sequel that's made specifically for the home console market; the creators reworked certain gameplay mechanics, creating new ideas and keeping some old ones for its brand new fighting design. The console versions of MK: DA are great games in their own right, but wait until you experience the title on the Game Boy Advance.  Unlike most Midway-published GBA titles, Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance for the handheld was an internal development, put together by members of the team responsible for Midway's last internal GBA development, SpyHunter (and one of the secrets in MK:DA offers a nod to the GBA game). Don't think of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance as a conversion of the console versions. This game definitely follows the same game design formula as the sequels that hit the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but the fighting engine is more tailored for the Game Boy Advance hardware and button configuration.   The move from console to handheld must have been a daunting task, especially with what the designers were pulling off for the PS2, GCN, and X-box systems. Cartridge space is definitely the largest factor in its development, and for the GBA game the developers lifted 12 of the most prominent fighters from the arsenal of 23 created for the consoles. Fighters that have made the cut this time around are Scorpion, Sonya, Jax, and Kung Lau, with newcomers Kenshi, Frost, and Li Mei rounding out the normal set of troops. By playing through the game, players can unlock Kano, Sub-Zero, Kitana, Quan Chi, and Shang Tsung. Incidentally, the Game Boy Advance version of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is the only version of the game that actually features the Shang Tsung morphing element; the console Shang Tsung cannot morph into other characters. Props to the GBA edition!  The Game Boy Advance isn't a 3D system by any means, so the team reduced the 3D models into pre-rendered sprites with several dozen frames of animations apiece. But to simulate a 3D environment, the engine utilizes the GBA's hardware scaling and rotating abilities to provide a freeflowing set of arenas, with a camera that zooms in, out, and around the action as the action progresses. Blood, a Mortal Kombat staple, explodes out of nearly every attack, landing on the rotating arena and remaining there until the end of the bout. Several arenas even utilize the team's impressive ~reflection~ technology established in SpyHunter; shiny floor surfaces will actually show a hazy mirror image of the fighters and background terrain.    But as impressive as the game engine is, it's the gameplay that's the real test of a game's fun; after all, as good as last year's Mortal Kombat Advance looked and sounded, it played like absolute garbage. I'm pleased to say that Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is a very solid, controllable fighter on the Game Boy Advance. The commands are easily pulled off using the four-button configuration, with A and B buttons used for punches and kicks, R trigger for block and the L trigger for switching types of fight styles on the fly.      The GBA game, like the console version, focuses both on distance and up-close fighting, with emphasis on stringing combos together by juggling opponents into the air. It's a very satisfying experience discovering which moves can be connected together for a multiple hit series of moves; all characters have a wide range of different attacks, and the developers leave it up to you to figure out the best way to link them all together for the most powerful combos. And like the Tekken series, there are a couple of canned combos that players can pull off as well. Some special moves aren't balanced quite as much as they should have been; Kitana's fan blade throw, for example, is extremely wimpy compared to previous versions of the series, almost making it a worthless attack.  New to the series is the extremely fluid 3D interaction; players can simply sidestep by walking around the arena. The way the developers worked the controls on the GBA has to be commended, because it's near seamless the way you can both duck and jump, as well as sidestep around the arena using the same D-pad...all without worrying about a secondary button command.  Of course, it wouldn't be Mortal Kombat without the fatalities, and those key moves are also in here. After winning a bout, players can pull off a move that will violently finish off the loser. Like the past 2D Mortal Kombat games, MK:DA doesn't waste a whole lot of cartridge space on these animations; these violent moves, like Scorpion's head yank or Sub-Zero's spine remover, simply use existing frames of animations, adding a few extra chunks of gore during the motion. They're still fun to pull off, though...but nothing terribly nauseating.  The developers also put a lot of emphasis on single-player fighting, which is an area that most console fighting games seem to forget. In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, each fight will net the player currency (called Koins in the game) than can (and should) be traded in at the Krypt for dozens of hidden extras. There are 120 different Koffins to open, each with a special treat inside. They can only be opened with a specific number of Koins, and the more expensive the price, the more significant the prize. Most of the extras are simply cleverly-named palette-swaps of the 12 different fighters, but there are some major items, like stage select mode and extra fighting arenas. These Koins can also be earned from other players by betting them in the Versus mode; a victory against another player through the use of the link cable will award you the Koins he put up for grabs. The developers really put the cartridge save to use; up to three players can create and name their own profile, which then will record elements from the game. Their win/loss  There are even a couple of mini-games included during the single-player modes. Test Your Might makes a return from the first Mortal Kombat title, where players must hammer away at the trigger buttons and time their strike to shatter the block of wood or concrete. Test Your Sight lifts the ~shell game~ idea, quickly swapping the right goblet between four of the wrong choices. Funny how this looks and plays almost exactly like the mini-game in Midway's classic Tapper arcade game. I'm sure that's intentional... Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is one heck of a polished GBA production, but there's a few areas that could have used a couple more tweaks. Some battles have an odd glitch where the loser will stand around for a couple of seconds before the game registers his knockout. Some fast-moving attacks, like Kano's somersault, are too fast for the camera to follow, so if players dodge the move, Kano will be off-screen until the ~camera~ can catch up. And by default, the game is set at a brightness level that seems to wash out the colors just a tad too much; the brightness level can be adjusted in the options menu, but the setting doesn't get saved to the cartridge. And, as awesome as the mode is, it would have been great had the profile screen kept track of other elements like number of fatalities, most used character, largest or most powerful combo, or other goofy stats. Midway hasn't exactly had the highest standards when releasing titles for the Game Boy Advance. NFL Blitz, Defender, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, and Midway's Arcade Classics are by far the worst titles the GBA market has ever seen. So how did Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance get so good?As solid as the console games are, the Game Boy Advance version is equally so...maybe even more so. A lot of attention was poured into this project, from the fighting and graphics engine, to establishing enough presentation and extras to make the game an excellent single-player title. Little sprite quirks during the game keep the game from being absolutely fantastic, but any 2D fighting fan shouldn't miss what Midway's GBA team pulled off for the handheld.", "date": "Nov 20, 2002"}
