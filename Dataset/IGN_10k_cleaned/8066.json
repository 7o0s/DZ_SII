It's also true that Square of recent times has been broadening its game library with titles other than those in the RPG genre. Ehrgeiz is a good example of Square's segue into other game areas, following the releases of Tobal No. 1 and Tobal 2.   In a rather bizarre situation rare for Square, Ehrgeiz appeared in the Japanese and then the North American arcades prior to its home release. While performing decently in the Japanese arcades, distribution for Ehrgeiz was rare here in the US, and the game, while interesting in its exploration of 3D fighting, did not fair well.   The home console version relies on qualities similar to the arcade, but it's been improved, updated, and added to in many ways, making Ehrgeiz a more complete game than its arcade counterpart game - and more specialized for the home market. Special to the home version is a Quest mode and Mini Games mode, each adding strong replay value aspects and a broad kind of depth to the straight fighting game.  Gameplay Starring characters from previous Final Fantasy and other games are Godhand, Lee Shuwen, Dasher Inoba, Sasuke, Prince Doza, Yoyo Yoko, Jo, Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockhart, and Sephiroth (all three from Final Fantasy VII), and Han Daehan. Each character has his own her own strength and weakness as well as his or her own special moves. Cloud uses his giant sword, Tifa shoots off energy bursts, Godhand shoots off missiles from his hand, and Jo turns into a wild cat.  What's cool about Ehrgeiz is its free-roaming 3D engine, which developer Dream Factory worked especially well on, and which is actually a big improvement over its arcade cousin. Characters move quickly around the rings or environments with grace and ease, and are motion captured better than the average fighter. Adding to the overall feel of Ehrgeiz is the 12 different arenas. Gamers fight on several different platforms in each arena, complicating strategy and adding to defense against overly excited projectile shooters. The arenas also were constructed in rather small spaces, which counters the free-roaming sensibility. This at first seems kind of lame, but it's clear the developers wanted to fighters in range of one another, and it provides for a more tightly fought match. For a fully roaming 3D fighter, it's really just good game design to keep things tight.   In either Arcade or Vs. and with a few exceptions, Ehrgeiz is remarkably easy to pick up and play. That's its biggest strength, and ironically, its biggest weakness. Basic moves are all explained in the game, but the standard controls will give you some indication of how to fight. In the standard configuration, Triangle is a high hit, Square is a mid hit, and X is low. Circle is used for a special attack and is measured by a gauge, so special forces are limited. L1 and L2 are used for jumping and R1 and R2 for targeting, so players are always facing the opponent. Combining shoulder buttons with other buttons provide variations of moves and newer ones that are equally or even more effective than the basic moves. All characters are in the basic defensive position already, and almost all moves with the exception of specials can be blocked relatively easy.   The big problem with Ehrgeiz as a fighter is its simplicity. It's shallow and not terribly well balanced. For example, by picking Cloud Strife, players can kick the crap out of just about anyone by carefully managing his special attack, which is his sword attack. But by picking another character, say even Godhand, you'll have a much more difficult time getting through the game. Another big dilemma with the fighting system is the J moves, and in my opinion, the throws. The J moves are horrendously difficult to pull off, and they make the throws look easy to perform.  These should be less complicated and more intuitive to perform for a fighting game of this quality.  Specials Modes Standing alone, the fighting game wouldn't be of much interest. But along with the Mini Games and Quest, players have a fully-fledged set of related games that make for great single or two-player fun. The mini games are specialized track and field events, including a straight sand race, hurdles, and a funny crawling competition. The last one is my favorite, a version of the board game Othello, but with characters who run around fighting each other for the best squares.   The Quest Mode is also quite unique. Like Bushido and Tobal before it, Ehrgeiz enables gamers to wander through a set of environments in whittled-down hack-and-slash fashion. This is actually fun and intriguing, since players can collect all sorts of armor, weapons, and magic spells for their quest. It takes a good eight hours to play all the way through this, and it's especially cool to see it in a fighting game.  Graphics As usual, Square never spares the details when it comes to visual effects. With lots of Gouraud shading and details to body shape and color, the fighters all look gorgeous. What's more, they move exceptionally smoothly, although Tobal 2 seems to have the edge over Ehrgeiz in completely human movement. Still, response time is quick, and the frame rate is soaring at 60 frames per second.   And for all of those Square fans that love excellent CG movies, Ehrgeiz has one of the better openings I've seen in some time.  Sound After the opening sequence in which a barrage of visuals and sounds slash across your memory banks, your excitement level is bound to be in high gear. The music in the game is great through and through, especially memorable in the Quest mode.  The dreamy synth and moody themes are perfect for a long time in a dangerous dungeon, and provide gamers with a kind of audio experience than never dulls. The menu sounds are cool, took especially the club-lazer-ish zap from screen to screen.   In the fighting mode, the jazzed up rock brings a kind of mixed mood, ranging from the whiz-bang of a flashy heavy metal rock concert, to the low-key electronica sensibility. Overall the music is great, staying on par with the overall high quality production level of the graphics.OK, Ehrgeiz is a disappointment. I would have rather been able to buy Tobal 2 without the excessive import price tag, than buy Ehrgeiz. But, while not the best fighter on the block, Ehrgeiz has a number of good things going for it. After players zip through the piece-of-cake single-player fighting mode, the game has what it takes to content in the overall entertainment category. Two-player fighting is good enough fun, and will take up a lot of your time, but the simple little Mini Games are good enough to be games on their own. They're great fun. Man, I had a hell of a time beating the straight sand race!  And I can play the Othello type mini game for hours on end. I also found myself playing the Quest mode for more time than I had figured on -- always a good sign.All in all, Ehrgeiz is not for the hardcore gamer. It's for the more casual player who wants a little of everything and who may be intimidated by hardcore fighting games such as Tekken, Dead Or Alive, or Tobal.", "date": "May 6, 1999"}
