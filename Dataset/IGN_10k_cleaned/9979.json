Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/07/downstream-panic-review", "text": "Puzzle games are arguably the most inventive genre found in gaming these days, with developers deftly blending new and existing features into original titles. Last year's Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords was a great example of this, a game that managed to blend match-three gameplay with RPG elements and a storyline.   Developer Eko System has done a bit of mixing of its own, blending elements of LocoRoco with Worms to create the rather fascinating Downstream Panic! The game's use of water simulation mixed with destructible environments and a limited tool system has resulted in a challenging, unique and, at times, fairly complex puzzle game that's sure to test your problem solving skills.    The goal of Downstream Panic! is simple. A blob (or two) of water starts at the top of the screen, and when you press Start, it begins flowing downward into the environment. It's your job to make sure that the fish contained in said water make it to the bottom of the stage in a safe manner, with sectioned-off areas of the lower water filled with vicious piranha. To clear the first level, all you need to do is use your trusty rockets to blow holes in two sections of the land, and your fish will gracefully flow into the ocean below.   After that, things start getting much more tricky. You'll have to use a number of tools, like seeds that grow plants to stop the flow of water or fans that blow flowers to open bridges, but these are hand-selected and very limited in each level. Generally speaking, you start with the exact tools that you'll need to complete the level and no more, so careful planning is necessary to complete the stages by saving the requisite number of fish.   The stage design here is generally fantastic for a number of reasons. First, when a new tool or hazard is introduced, the game scales back the difficulty a bit to let you practice with the new elements, and then immediately cranks the challenge back up to where you left off with new abilities in tow. But more so, the puzzle setups are just great. When you begin a new stage, the first thing you'll have to do is scroll around and see how things are laid out. We tended to start at the bottom and work our way up, but given the complexity here, we imagine that everyone will use different planning methods.   Make sure your fish wear their coats when it's cold out. You'll have to come up with some pretty inventive (and timed) uses for your tools. For example, you could use a plant to block a fall-off spot to protect your fish, but the ~correct~ way to do it may be to save your plant for another spot and instead use a rocket to set a boulder free, and let that roll through the level and settle into the hole to protect your fish. Timing plays a very important part in many of the puzzles as well, as you'll need to get the water to certain levels before releasing it to another section, or you'll have to manipulate elements of the level in a certain order to save your fish. There are times when you'll need to sacrifice some in order to pass a stage, and timing is of the utmost importance here as to not lose too many.   The game is also very good about introducing new tools, hazards and all sorts of things throughout the course of the game. Every few stages you'll find something new to use or avoid, or at least a new way in which you'll have to approach things. For instance, the boulders we mentioned are simply a border to be passed in early levels, but after a while they'll become essential tools for completing the levels.    The thing that makes Downstream Panic! work is its water dynamics system. While it's obviously not of the fidelity that ILM would use it on Poseidon 2, it's pretty impressive for the PSP. Water will run between gaps, fill in craters, creep over crevices as the level rises and so forth. It's a really cool mechanic that really helps provide the game with its unique approach to the genre.   The title's replay factor is extended quite a bit by the Free Play and Survival modes. You need to play through to milestones in the game to unlock them, but each offers up compelling reasons to go back and tackle previously-beaten stages. Free Play lets you use the money that you've earned in the game to buy any amount of any tool for use in each stage. This makes things rather simple, but when trying to absolutely perfect everything, you'll need to be diligent about your purchases on one stage so that you have enough cash left over for another. The Survival mode runs you though most of the game's stages, but you don't regain any fish after each level. Kudos to anyone that can actually manage to finish this mode.    While Downstream Panic! certainly has a number of positives, it isn't perfect. Some of the timing issues are a pain as there's a bit of luck involved with things like the automatically spinning sea shells that let water flow from one area to another. If they don't spin when you expect them to, you're screwed. There's also sometimes a bit of luck involved with how rocks and such will move and roll, and you'll have to hope that they go where you want them to. They're largely predictable, but you can't always count on them.   The fluid dynamics are great. Our biggest gripe, however, is that you need to be pretty much pixel-perfect with the use of your tools in certain circumstances. For instance, you might need to have a tiny bit of water creep over a ledge to trigger something as to not lose too many fish, but the land that you're chipping away may be rather thin. If you cut just too much away, the game will mistake a thin slice of earth for a gap and the water will flow out. But if you don't cut enough, it'll continue to block the water. And since you have a limited supply of rockets at all times, one mistake generally means you'll fail. In other examples, which relates to the luck thing we just mentioned, you might need to cut a hole for a rock to go through, but if you don't cut it perfectly then it won't bounce or roll correctly and you'll be screwed. There were a handful of puzzles that we knew exactly how to solve, but had to retry them five or six times to get our slices just right so that everything fell into place.Downstream Panic! is one hell of an impressive puzzle game. It has a ton of character, and you won't find anything else that makes use of water like this on the system. It can be incredibly challenging at times, though the clever level design rarely makes you feel like something is unsolvable. There are a few issues with having to rely on pixel-perfect use of your tools at times and you'll occasionally need luck on your side, but these fallacies certainly don't outweigh the game's strong points.
