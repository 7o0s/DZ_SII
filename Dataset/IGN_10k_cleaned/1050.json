{"name": "Fur Fighters", "name_review": "Fur Fighters", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/24/fur-fighters-2", "text": "Who hasn't seen a fuzzy, big-eyed, undeniably cute mascot and had a deep-seeded desire to pound him into oblivion?  I wouldn't swear to it, but I'm guessing that the birth of Acclaim's Fur Fighters occurred somewhere between Barney's fall from grace and the rise of the Teletubbies as some sort of response to this insatiable craving to knock the uber-cute off their pedestal. Over a year has passed since information first started leaking out on Bizarre Creations' quirky little action title and now that it's finally here, the time has come to decide if killing all that's fit to cuddle is everything it was fluffed up to be.  From square one, Fur Fighters faced an uphill battle, as titles of the 3rd-person variety are certainly no stranger to the Dreamcast, with games like BioWare's MDK2 and Eidos' Soul Reaver having already made quite an impression.  To its credit, Fur Fighters manages to stand up against these titles in many senses, and in fact, combines the better aspects of both titles to come up with an interesting mix of shooting action and puzzle-driven adventure.  The gameplay itself is actually pretty solid.  Levels are well thought-out, and switching from character to character isn't as much of a pain in the ass as I thought it would be. The game's AI is pretty sharp, and will keep your palms sweating if you aren't making the most of your available arsenal. My only complaint here would be that General Bristol is way too generous in offering up guidance for a not-so-confused gamer.  He at times serves as the game's story teller, so you get used to speaking to him.  The next thing you know, he pops up, and you innocently walk over expect some plot detail, and he flat out tells you how to solve the next puzzle.  After a while, he seemed to show up for every single slow moment in the puzzle-solving process, and it ruined numerous puzzles that I could have figured out on my own.  Unfortunately, touch the guy and you get stuck with his spoiler message, as Bizarre made it impossible to skip any dialog.  Granted, you don't have to talk to him, but I almost wish there was some way to get rid of this guy, because the puzzles that do exist would have seemed a lot more challenging had I not talked to him at all. Sure, the game looks cute, but did it have to treat you like a child the whole time?  I may not like to be babied when it comes to game progression, but as for controlling the action, Fur Fighters is right on the money, followed Interplay's alien shooter in emulating the controller-friendly ~Turok-style.~ As a result, it manages to move along quite effortlessly.  Everything from negotiating a crowd of bad guys to choosing with which weapon you'll bring about their stitch-splitting end is fairly natural, and fans of the genre will be right at home here.  In fact, the control would be perfect were it not for one small problem: the camera.  As an action-adventure title with lots of platforming elements, the game's viewpoint seems to go out of its way to obscure where your character's feet are headed via a camera angle that is way too low to the ground.  Basically, the camera sits level with your feet and this certainly goes a long way to show off the game's awesome architecture and sense of humor, but personally I'd rather see my objective than my character. The camera also has a really hard time when your character gets closed in, and cuts to a first person view that further complicates the problem.  Between the two, my fuzzy heroes had to repeat countless platforming performances, and after the 10th time of trying to land a simple jump because I couldn't see where I was going, the game managed to get annoying real quick.  If they would have pulled the camera out and tilted it up a bit, Bizarre would have hit their first 3rd person nail on the head.   Despite the camera's problems, the visuals it highlights are nothing short of awesome.  The levels themselves are huge, and often sport tons of interaction and moving elements that show Bizarre spent a lot of time trying to make you feel like you were in the center of a vibrant, engrossing world. Sporting a very cartoony look, the game offers a wealth of wonder from a graphical standpoint, and the kiddy look makes the in-game action all the more amusing.  You almost feel bad when a stray bullet catches a big-eyed bunny, but the goofy reactions of your character and the bad guys make you loose all hope of taking the game seriously long enough to call the P.C. police.  And this has to be one of Fur Fighters' strongest points.  The game is pretty dammed funny. I've mentioned some of the tongue-in-cheek humor in earlier looks at the game, but nothing prepared me for sitting down and getting a look at all the little things they've packed in there.  From the movie theater in New Quack city featuring A Thin Red Lion, to blasting a bad guy to the tune of a flushing toilet as he steps out of a port-a-potty in the ~Beaver Power~ level, there are tons of things that will leave you bustin' a gut.  The humor is definitely skewed towards an older audience at times, but pop culture buffs will get near-endless kicks out of the flood of references tucked away in this sprawling adventure.  Depth is another element that isn't in short supply in FF.  As is the case with other recent 3rd person adventure titles, for better of worse, this game will give you plenty to see and do, and hosts a heavy dose of transitional cinemas to carry both the story and the aforementioned level of comedy.  If you like your games long, you won't have any complaints about the Fur.  Between collecting babies and tokens, a 20 hour run your first time through is almost generous, and when you throw in the game's multi-player mode, this game offers plenty of bang for its buck. Almost a little too much for my taste at times, but thankfully, the humor and variety found in the game's various characters pick the game up by the tail when it starts to drag.  The Fluffmatch itself has taken some huge steps since we first saw it, and the final product offers up a multi-player mode that, while obviously not as deep as the likes of Perfect Dark or Unreal Tournament, is a nice compliment to a strong 1-player offering. The maps have a fair amount of variety in terms of look, layout, and size, and this really helps.  The addition of a first-person view helped make this aspect infinitely more playable, and the framerate is flawless, even with four players, which makes it one of the best in-game deathmatch experiences available on a console.  If they would have added in a few options such as team play, ctf, etc., this aspect of the game would have been a lot more worthwhile, but as it stands, it's still quite fun.  In fact, that kinda sums up my thoughts on Fur fighters as a whole.  It is obviously a product that has a lot to offer, and you can tell Bizarre went to great lengths to make sure that the game was something special.  It's a bit of a shame that they didn't pay a bit more attention to other titles in the genre, though, as they missed a few easy key areas that really kept it from being a must-have title on the Dreamcast. When all is said an done, FF is certainly worth a look, but its short-comings keep it from being as enjoyable as it could have been.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 24, 2000"}
