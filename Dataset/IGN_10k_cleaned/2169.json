This game is puzzling to me. Do I like it? Is it boring? Is it good? Where's my pants? These are all questions brought up by a game, that when broken down, is fairly decent, but for some strange reason is both boring and addicting at the same time. For those uninitiated into the land of the railroad games, they generally challenge you to one of two things: a) drive a train along a track making sure not to crash... yeah, or b) create a successful network of railroads. This particular game follows choice b by putting you in a race to map out the United States with as much track as possible before your competitors can.  The game takes place from the start of the railroad revolution to the near future where cars are forgotten for the romantic appeal of a good train ride... okay maybe not the last part, but they are pretty... a little... okay nevermind. Anyhow, in your attempt to railroad the United States into falling under your monopolistic thumb, you'll need to build tracks connecting to the many cities present on the map of the US and some in Canada and Mexico. But the goal here isn't really the money you make, but the prestige you gain from building the most and longest lines. It's a different way of looking at things, but a strange one in some cases, as I'll explain in a minute.  But this isn't a game where you're going to be able to sit on your duff and consider things for a while. It's a real time strategy game and the computer opponents you'll come up against in single player will be able to manage their businesses and consider their next move a lot faster than you will. This isn't really a bad thing as it adds a certain sense of immediacy into the game which is nice, but when paired with taking care of your tracks and planning out attacks on other rail barons, it can take away from the fun of planning a bit. There's just something a little strange about playing a fast paced railroad game I guess.  Part of the initial lull comes from the difficulty of getting started. For some reason, the game was shipped without a tutorial and only a basic walkthrough to the beginning of a level to give you cracked foundation to jump in and play. The interface can be a little intimidating at first if you don't know what anything means and while the manual explains a lot, it doesn't help with everything and you might just end up feeling a little lost for a while.  Building railways themselves is really very simple, select your starting city, click the lay track button, and then click the destination city, and then hit the purchase button. You can even ask the computer for suggestions as to where you should go with the next track. The interface will show you how much the rail will cost and how long it'll take to build so you can make sure of the route you want to go. Chances are, you'll need to take out a loan or two to get your railways up and moving, so be prepared to be in the hole for a while. It's a necessary evil and one that can actually be strangely used to your advantage. If you borrow as much money as you can towards the beginning of the game and build some tracks, and then after you've gone as far in the hole as the game allows declare bankruptcy, you can get out of debt for little penalty. You'll still have your railroads minus a couple that may get auctioned off, but it was well worth the waiting period to get out of bankruptcy in certain cases. There were a couple of games that after getting out of bankruptcy (at which point you're making money but not spending it) I went to get a loan and saw that I could get a huge chunk of money out making it much easier to complete my missions. One particular free form game I declared bankruptcy twice and ended up spanking my competitors. There's something a little wrong with that I think.  Of course, you could always earn money the old fashioned way. This takes some serious effort however. After completing a track, you can assign different types of passenger and freight trains to run the track. You can set these as the default trains on every track you build which is nice. What isn't nice is the amount of time you'll have to spend in the track list (which can get absolutely huge) making sure you have the right number of trains running on the tracks to take care of all of the traffic. You'll end up running down the list adjusting everything yourself unless you have a huge some of money to pay for managers for each of the tracks, which is my experience, weren't very good anyway. And money can be hard to come by when you're trying to keep up with computer opponents.  After you have the basics down, you can begin to see some of the strategy involved in choosing what city to connect to or how to hurt your opponent. Getting to know the cities in the game is really the only way that you'll be able to decide the direction you want to take your railroad. Effectively blocking off areas from other players is a hard thing to do, but one that's necessary for certain regions. Letting a player build a transcontinental railway all by himself is a big no-no.  You see, the game is not based on how much money you can make in the game, but how much prestige you build in the course of the game. You gain prestige by actions like achieving the highest rail saturation level in a territory or building a huge railway such as a TransAmerica railway that spans across the US or the Canada to Gulf of Mexico railway. These ones will win you a bunch of prestige points depending on how much of the railway connecting both areas was yours. So naturally, connecting certain expanses will be necessary for blocking opponents from potentially connecting the entire US themselves is a must.   There are other ways of effecting the prestige levels of other players that your up against aside form doing good for yourself. A curse on both your houses as it were. During the course of the game, different cards will flash upon the screen (usually too fast to even notice that it just happened) and you'll have the option to either cash these in for money, or use them towards some dastardly deeds. If you choose to do this, you'll need to access the politics panel or a specific track influence screen at which point you can choose which opponent you want to hurt. Here you'll be able to influence investigators to turn their heads in your opponent's direction, influence unions to strike, commit sabotage, or even raid their coffers for some money. If you have more of a certain type of cards than your opponent, then you're deceit will succeed and your target will lose prestige, money or use of his rails. Its a fun tactic, but much more fun if you're actually playing against a human opponent in multiplayer.   Of course, the way you play will also have to reflect the objectives of the game you are playing. Regular single player games and multiplayer games challenge players to gain the most prestige by the end of a span of time, while the scenarios in the game challenge players to various tasks which much be completed in a predetermined time period whether it be connecting a few cities in a small amount of time to reclaiming you ruined railroad network after the civil war before your competitors can beat you to it. Actually losing a game because your prestige level isn't as high is kind of strange sometimes. In one particular game, my network was worth around a billion dollars more than the next guys, but I still lost because he had more prestige. That just doesn't seem right to me somehow.  While all of this is nice, this is where I really start getting confused. You see, the game really wasn't all that interesting to me, but for some reason, I just wanted to play it more. I guess its my old 4X mentality coming out of being able to beat my opponent that much faster with that much more satisfyingly. So to say that it succeeds in certain areas wouldn't be an exaggeration.  There are some areas where it doesn't really succeed at all however. Sure, in a game like this, the graphics aren't really the most important thing. The suspension of disbelief factor is really toned down due to the overview nature of the game like you're sitting in some ethereal control room of the railroad god, but still, the look is just boring. It seems like something could have been done to spice things up a little bit... but aside from being able to zoom out to a satellite view of the United States and into see the rails themselves and the trains on them, there really isn't anything here to shout about. Cities are dull little blobs, trains are blocks traveling over low definition tracks, and the back of my aunt's leg is more interesting looking then the veins of railways crossing along the nation.  Sound is equally as bland but I'm not exactly sure what it is they could have done to help this out. A smattering of sound effects are used mainly to indicate alerts to trains being finished and messages from your opponents. If you zoom in close to the railways you can hear the horn, but it isn't really anything you need to hear twice.  So we come back to my problem... the game seems to be addictive and at least passably fun while in the middle of it, but I can't really say that I ever got excited playing it, or ever really looked forward to playing it when I was off doing other things. The only conclusion that I can draw from this is that Rails Across America is great for certain people that like railroads a whole lot or are really looking for a change from the overused resource, build, and destroy formula of most violent real time strategy games.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
