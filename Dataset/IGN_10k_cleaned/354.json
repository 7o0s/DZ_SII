{"name": "Gex 3", "name_review": "Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/28/gex-3-deep-cover-gecko", "text": "Many years ago Crystal Dynamics introduced Gex, a fast-talking gecko with attitude, for the ill-fated 3DO system. With snappy one-liners provided by comedian Dana Gould and the ability to walk on walls, the wily lizard was supposed to be the biggest thing since Mario. He wasn't. But this hasn't stopped Crystal Dynamics and [insert publisher here] from rolling out sequel after sequel. Last year Midway Entertainment released Gex: Enter the Gecko, a sloppily executed port of the average PlayStation 3D platformer, for Nintendo 64. Now, Nintendo 64 owners get the Crave Entertainment published Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, a continuation of last year's title with new levels, one-liners, enemies and the like. The big problem here is that these ongoing 3D Gex platformers just aren't very good. And quite frankly, releasing this title into Nintendo 64's already proven 3D platform library is like pitting the original Turok against the PC market's current first-person shooter lineup.  The Facts   256-megabit (32MB cart) 27 levels (including three new exclusive N64 levels) Arsenal of moves includes wall-climbing, tail-whipping, tail-squashing, karate kicks and the all new tongue swing Drive vehicles like tanks, go scuba diving, gliding and more All new costumes for Gex to wear Three hidden characters and loads of secrets One-liners courtesy of wacky man Dana Gould Memory and Rumble Pak compatible   Story No.  Gameplay Deep Cover Gecko plays identically to last year's offering. Players move Gex around with the analog stick, the A button jumps and the B button executes the reptile's tail-whip. Z-Trigger activates Gex's tongue, which sucks in fly food for energy and the R button makes the character duck and swim underwater. There are a handful of other moves, of course, such as tail-squashes and the ability to walk on walls, but the mechanics are not very deep.   Control is a bit on the loose side, partly due to a sometimes-stuttering framerate and partly because of design. Nintendo 64 platform lovers are likely to notice the fact that Gex moves digitally. The analog stick works, but it doesn't offer precision movement. Rather, it works as the D-Pad would, offering a limited degree of movement. Pressing the analog stick to the right makes Gex run to the right regardless of how much pressure is applied. More importantly though, the selection of moves is tired and controlling the wise-cracking lizard around the game's 3D environments, in all honesty, is just plain boring.  Each of the game's two dozen theme levels have a specific set of goals that must be accomplished, some easier than others. In one world we might be asked to knock out a group of snowboarding elves and in another our goal could be to activate a number of switches in order to solve a puzzle. None of the action is terribly difficult, but some of it is tedious. Depending on what level of difficulty the game is set on, for example, players will be required to collect 100 flycoins (the equivalent of musical notes in Banjo-Kazooie) to unlock secret areas. If you've played Banjo-Kazooie, you know how annoying these tasks can be.   The game plays well enough and serves up a good amount of variation (whether it be riding animals and vehicles, visiting different theme worlds or acquiring new abilities), but, in spite of all of this, it still doesn't deliver a very enjoyable experience. Like last year's game, Gex 3 isn't awful, but it's nowhere as good as a title like Super Mario 64 in terms of design and appearance. Compared to some of Nintendo 64's already available platform games, in fact, the reptile feels clunky, poorly designed and repetitive -- it just can't compete, and it has no place on the console.  Graphics The game opens to reveal what appears to be a gigantic earthquake in the sky and then later on a boat displaying the Crystal Dynamics logo. After a moment of watching, we realize that this is, in fact, not an earthquake after all, but a demonstration of the game's seizure-inducing camera system (and of some very shaky gameplay to come). The viewpoint, unfortunately, never smoothens out and we are left to battle through shaky environments with our lizard host.   On a brighter note, Crystal Dynamics has managed to unlock a decent amount of flashy graphics this time around, as opposed to last year's fog-drowned first effort. Textures are crisper and now feature shadowing (as well as some tacky animation), objects are well modeled and detailed and, for the most part, animation of characters is top-notch. Again, though, the camera system seems to be in direct competition with Earthworm Jim 3D for the title of Worst Viewpoint in a Videogame. The 32MB cartridge has been utilized to digitize (FMV) the likeness of some supermodel who Gex is evidently in cahoots with. The footage is grainy, but it gets the job done. If you're anything like us, you'll probably press the start button and skip through it all anyway.   All in all, the visuals aren't too bad, nor are they incredibly good. Like last year's game, they fall somewhere in between and can be classified ~PlayStation-esque.~ If you have any doubts that Gex 3 is a port, its visuals are the proof to be sure.   Sound ~I would have a problem playing Gex because I don't want to hear me that much.~ -- Dana Gould, the voice of Gex.  We absolutely couldn't agree more. The one-liners in this game are like a Saturday Night Live sketch -- they're mildly entertaining for 30 seconds, but after a half-hour of the same old routine we want to vomit. Half of the comments make no sense whatsoever, with Gex spouting gibberish like, ~Hey -- yeah, look at me, I'm wearing socks.~ That's not actually taken from the game, mind you, but it could very well be. Unfortunately, Dana Gould's unfunny one-liners do not stop after a half-hour of torturous repetition. They continue on and on and on some more, pounding themselves through your head and into the very core of your brain.   The music and non-Gex sound effects are executed well enough, but are unfortunately drowned out by Dana Gould's one-liners. Truly a miserable listening experience If you must play this game, please, for the love of all those who might happen to be near the television, play it with the volume all the way down. The Gex franchise has never been a great one. This makes the many sequels it has spawned particularly baffling to me. Even more baffling, though, is the fact that the below average series has actually popped up twice now for Nintendo 64 -- a console that has the best selection of quality platformers available. Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko is marginally better than last year's title. It offers more variety and slightly prettier graphics, but the uninspired gameplay mechanics remain intact. Add in the fact that Dana Gould's one-liners make me want to kill the main character and I can honestly say that I want nothing to do with this game. Please, Crystal Dynamics, no more. No more.", "date": "Oct 28, 1999"}
