It was so different that many argued it could be considered a whole new game.   So when Norwegian developers Funcom sat down to decide how they could follow that up in their next expansion they clearly had no interest in churning out a 'formula' expansion by just throwing out a new land mass and maybe a new playable race or class. They also wanted to bring Anarchy Online firmly back to its pure sci-fi origins.   So what did they come up with? A good old fashioned alien invasion! Little green men (albeit rather nasty looking Geiger-inspired little green men) coming down in their oversized spaceships to terminate the existence of the local population.   Since the expansion was originally intended to add player cities and new social features like non-combat orientated costumes and new vehicles, the established player base was slightly surprised when it was announced that their new player cities would be the targets of invasions! In this expansion the mobs have turned the tables and are hunting the players for a change!   So how does it all work?   In terms of actual content Alien Invasion's new features can be broken down into sections: the promised arrival of new social clothing, new vehicle models and the ability for players to craft their own player-maintained towns and cities. On top of those features you have the invasion of the aliens themselves, which throws in some new gameplay mechanics into the Anarchy Online mix.   Before we get into the details of the invasion itself it's worth exploring the options provided by the new player built cities. Despite the age of the engine the new player buildings are stunning, both inside and out. Tall spires dominate the skylines towering above towers, radar dishes, landing pads and silos flanking the streets of the new player cities. They really do have the 'wow' factor the first time you glimpse a city from just about any distance, be it the tall skyscrapers in the distance as you travel Rubi-Ka or the lovely details on the interiors of the buildings from large conference rooms, through film-noir inspired bars to dark and industrial styled PvP arenas.     Each building has a purpose. Most buildings offer a side benefit in the form of minor stat buffs for the organisation that owns it. Organisations are Anarchy Online's version of player guilds or clans, and each city plot is owned and operated by organisations, not by individual players, so players need to pool their resources to create and maintain the new structures. Building itself is handled by the nice and clean city interface that the organisations' leaders can use to place new buildings. Each plot is divided up into sections that can fit a given number of buildings; more buildings can be placed on more expensive plots.   Beyond the social locations in the player buildings (things like bars and swimming pools) you'll find new clothing quests which add further to the already strong social aspect of Anarchy Online. There is more to Rubi-Ka then blasting your enemies, you know, and you're just as likely to find players lounging in one of the in-game nightclubs as out in the fray; this expansion adds a whole slew of new threads for these party animals! Rather than offering stat bonuses and abilities like other equipment armor items are purely for roleplaying and offer cosmetic benefits. They range from skimpy French maid outfits through cowboy suits to full on biker leathers. In fact we are fairly sure the entire cast of the Village People get a look in!    Many MMORPGs have had major problems with player cities and buildings. The main problem that most suffer is that it leaves older population hot spots undervalued and spreads the player base out quite thinly. This makes the world seem somewhat unpopulated. This is where the invasion comes in; by tying the player built cities to a new game mechanic Funcom have neatly sidestepped the issue of them being underused on an ongoing basis and at the same time given the players reasons to keep visiting old haunts.   The alien invasion aspect is actually another incarnation of Anarchy Online's 'content on demand' style of gameplay and players are actually able to prompt alien attacks by shutting down the defensive shields that normally cloak their cities. This means that by and large, though there are still occasional random attacks, the organisation itself can control when the aliens attack allowing them to schedule them for when they have the right number of players available to deal with the aliens.   The attacks work in two stages. First an alien landing craft drops down near to the city and several waves of aliens disembark to attack the players. The game's AI can account for the numbers and levels of the players present at the time of the attack and will spawn an appropriate amount and type of mobs. This way players in smaller cities won't be overwhelmed right away. Similarly players in larger cities will still see a lot of action.   Several waves of aliens will attack and if the players are successful in repelling those invaders a large boss mob will come down. The action on the ground is fast and frantic (and often pretty chaotic!) as players try and fight off the aliens and hopefully do away with the boss mob. If they can also defeat the boss then a group of the defending players will be selected board the alien space craft and launch a counter attack!   These sections utilise Anarchy Online's long established AGC system (Auto Generated Content) to create the interiors of an alien space ship which will be different in layout every time. Just like during the ground section the player's goal is to fight through to a boss mob that lies at the control centre of the spaceship. There is a time limit though and the players have to complete the counter attack before the alien vessel leaves. The action is fairly frantic and the players are given the incentive to keep a good pace and not be overly cautious.   Players also earn alien experience for killing the aliens which gives them access to a special alien set of 'perks' special abilities and bonuses that allow players to further customise their characters.   Like the player cities the design and effects associated with the attacks are very impressive, from the huge mother ships that loom overhead during an attack to squadrons of small fighters buzzing about the encounters with the aliens are literally dripping with atmosphere.    The new player experience has been completely overhauled. Once a new player creates their character the shuttle taking them down to Rubi-Ka is shot down and they end up crashed just outside a shuttle port where various NPCs get them accustomed to the world of Anarchy Online. They also provide some introductory quests with some nice rewards to get a new player started. This is just the ticket for a game that has always had a steep learning curve. The game's GUI has also been updated again and is now fully customisable and XML based to allow for player made 'skins' the first of which have already started to appear.   It all sounds very good, doesn't it? There are still some troubling issues. Various balance concerns in regards of the costs of the new player housing and associated tasks will need to be addressed to keep the players happy in the long term. Some smaller organisations have also bemoaned the size of some of the smaller city plots which can only support a couple of buildings.     The mechanics of the alien attacks themselves do have some weaknesses. Although the aliens do spawn enough mobs of the correct for all the players present there is nothing to stop higher level players killing the weaker aliens intended for their lower level friends. Likewise the high level aliens won't think twice about turning on the lower level players if they get in the way, meaning that if there is a wide range of levels in an organisation it can be fairly frustrating for the low to mid level players.   More disappointing is the omission of the player managed shops. A last minute bug during beta testing meant that the feature was pulled. Whilst it is promised 'as soon as possible', and anything that could have meant the loss of player possessions was better out than in, it is a feature much anticipated by the players of Anarchy Online.   The downside of trying something different and innovative is that the usual collection of minor irritations and bugs familiar to all MMORPG expansions rear their ugly head early on. But no less than seven days after release Funcom have already started the post expansion patches to quash these issues. However if these kind of teething issues are not something you easily tolerate you might want to give the expansion a few weeks to settle down before diving in. Unlike Shadowlands which offered content for all levels and types of players, unless you are a member of an organisation you will potentially miss out on much of the content of Alien Invasion.    Alien Invasion is very much an expansion pack aimed at the game's existing player base and organisations and should be judged as such. The new starter area aside, Alien Invasion will only yield value for your time and money if you either are, or plan on becoming, a member of an organisation in Anarchy Online.    There are things do to for the solo player in this expansion, but they are the exception rather than the rule, so if you are not the social type then you might want to think twice about Alien Invasion. If you've never felt like there was a reason to joining player organisations in the past then this expansion might very well offer you the incentive to go out there and make friends to join in the alien bashing!  Despite some problems, the expansion succeeds at what it set out to accomplish. It has added another dimension to the gameplay in Anarchy Online and you can't help but admire the style with which it is pulled it off. It can only be good for the genre as a whole when a developer is prepared to stray from the formula expansion path and try something different, something for which Funcom should be commended, even if everything hasn't quite worked as expected out of the gates. The beauty of the MMORPG genre is the developers get the chance to quickly patch the problems. So we are sure many of the teething problems we mention will be addressed sooner rather then later.From the majestic scope of the new buildings to the impact of seeing an alien mother ship dwarfing them from above ala Independence Day, all you are really missing is a few Will Smith wisecracks and you have the recipe from the late summer movie blockbusters: fast action, lots of eye candy and a good old fashioned sci-fi story best enjoyed with friends.", "date": "Sep 8, 2004"}
