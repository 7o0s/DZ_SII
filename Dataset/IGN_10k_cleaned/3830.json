{"name": "Syberia", "name_review": "Syberia Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/06/syberia-review-3", "text": "is a return to times of old. A PC adventure appearing in ported form on the Xbox, Syberia retains the point and click aspects of games like Grim Fandango, Curse of Monkey Island, and Myst. It's odd that a game with such an antiquated interface is appearing on the Xbox. A purebred adventure, Syberia relies on its immersive story to captivate gamers rather than flashy explosions and gimmicky comedic wit.   Kate Walker, lawyer extraordinaire, is sent to the quaint French town of Valadilene to negotiate the takeover of the local automaton (wind up robots) company by the Universal Toy Company. However, her arrival coincides with the untimely death of Anna Voralberg -- the sole owner of the automatons. Fortunately, you thought something like this might happen, so you have all the proper legal documentation at your disposal. It's simple, talk to the notary, get some papers, confirm the deal, and then Kate can return home. Things, as usual, don't go as planned. In her last will and testament, Anna reveals that the company does indeed have an heir. Her thought to be deceased brother is, instead, very much alive and resides somewhere in Syberia.    It's up to Kate to figure out the whereabouts of Hans Voralberg (the heir), reach him, and get him to sign a couple things. This riveting plot is the basis of your some twenty hour adventure into a world of deception, giant wind up robots, a mammoth fetish, and the personal life of Kate Walker.   Gameplay  Syberia isn't all that complicated. You guide Kate through her quest with the left analog stick. Accessing her large inventory (which is kept in her form fitting jacket) is done with a press of the Y button. The A button is your action button, and B lets you cancel such actions. Oddly, the ability to run wasn't mapped onto the analog stick, so unless you want to plod through the entire game you'll need to hold down X.    As you wander around town, certain areas will be highlighted by a small golden halo or magnifying glass. These icons mean that you can interact with the highlighted object, whether it be picking up a fax or knocking on someone's door. The magnifying glass lets you explore a specific area of a room like shelving, desks, or closets. Finding items is easy in these areas because you just need to scroll the cursor around the screen until it changes to the ~pick up item~ icon.     As you meander through your adventure, you'll encounter odd automatons and other obstacles that prevent you from getting Han's needed approval. Passing such obstructions requires you to solve what are usually simple puzzles. If an ~interact with~ icon pops up, zoom in on that location and scroll over the entire area until you find something you can interact with. Sometimes the puzzle is as simple as pulling a couple levers, but at other times you'll need to insert objects to get something to work (Kate will tell you that you need to insert an item).  If you're stuck, you can simply try every single item in your inventory until you find the one that works -- if you don't have any that do, it means you missed an item along your way. Even when things get more complex than simply applying an object, Syberia makes sure you won't get confused. Early on in the game, you pick up a set of gears that you need to make a machine work. Near these gears is a depiction of how they should fit together -- so you think that you need to remember this. When you finally find where these gears go, you'll learn that you can't put a gear in an incorrect slot.   Other than your sporadic encounter with puzzles, you'll occasionally need to read documents (which you'll have to zoom in on with the right trigger to make them legible) that will give you background information or clues. Some of these, like the faxes, will give you numbers you can call to get that needed hint or relevant information. Luckily for you, Kate comes equipped with a cell phone that allows her to both make and receive calls. At certain intervals you'll even be treated to banter from Kate's friends and husband that have nothing to do with her predicament, but are meant to give you some insight into her personal life.    Basically, you'll encounter a lot of instances where you aren't doing anything but sitting and listening to phone conversations, talking to the few residents (via a menu of talking points allows you to pick your line of inquiry), or reading through pages of text. While it's meant to make you more immersed in the story, it instead makes Syberia a rather trying experience. The story is starts out slow and your motives do little to inspire you along on your journey.    Even the simple act of exploring (basically the entirety of the game) gets tiring. Moving between screens often takes more work than finding items because Kate has to be in a certain place on a screens edge (instead of any point) to advance. Equally annoying is that you'll be able to see an area in a room -- in front of you -- but you can't get there. You aren't given free reign over the environment, instead there is a very specific path that you must take. Almost as annoying as the navigation is that most of the time you'll have to repeatedly press buttons to get them to register. Rarely have I encountered an instance where opening a door or picking up an object only required me to hit A once.   Graphics  Like the Resident Evil series, Syberia employs pre-rendered backgrounds and static camera angles. Sure, the art is great -- environments are both beautiful and detailed. They give you the impression that you're traversing through a painting. Unfortunately, Kate is usually the only thing moving. Yes, there's the occasional character that moves as you speak with him or an animated cut scene as automatons are deployed, but for the most part you're walking through static backdrops.    Kate's movements are fairly lifelike and fluid, whether she's walking or running.  However, most of the other characters look fairly comical when they move around.    Sound  Syberia does a great job with sound effects. Every surface Kate walks over has a different clang or bang, whether it be metal stairs, cobble stone walkways, gravel paths, or wood floors. Background noise is also full of birds whistling, running water, breeze moving through trees, or the odd clinking of automatons.     Equally impressive is the musical score used sparingly throughout the adventure. It seems to reflect the inquisitive nature of Kate's quest while also sounding distinctly foreign. The voice acting is also decent, although suffers both from translation and uninspired dialogue. It's pleasant enough to listen to, although usually uninteresting.  I can see the appeal of Syberia, it's like playing through a book in game form. The problem is that this doesn't really work. Controls are frustratingly unresponsive, which is just unacceptable for a title with such simple controls. The actual puzzle elements are not only easy, but compose a mere fraction of the game. The rest of your time is spent waiting for Kate to wrap up dialogue or re-trekking from one end of a town to another. The story isn't all that captivating, and there's little that compels you to find Hans. While the sound and graphics are artful, far too much time is spent looking at static screens as Kate talks to people. If you're captivated by story telling and love adventure games in the style of Myst opposed to the comic wit of Grim Fandango, then you'll probably be content with Syberia. If you enjoy actually participating in games, you'll be fighting boredom throughout your adventure.", "date": "Aug 6, 2003"}
