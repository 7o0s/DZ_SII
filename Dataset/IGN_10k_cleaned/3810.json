This game is nothing more than a US release of Gremlin's Actual Golf, retitled and slapped with a snazzy Fox-style video sequence at the beginning. Still, it's a quality product that deserves notice in the saturated PC golf market.  In Fox Sports Golf 99, the developers opted for real-time rendered characters to serve as on-screen golfers, instead of the usual run of photo-realistic players used by other golf titles. Obviously the characters don't look as real as they would if they were captured directly from video, but having the character in 3D delivers a far more convincing 3D perspective. The camera can be placed in any location on the fairway, and the game can even be seen literally through the player's eyes. Cooler still, during foursomes, idle players pace back and forth or watch on as the current player takes his swing. Hey, it's the little things that make a game jump.  The game also takes advantage of 3D hardware - it's a good thing, too, since the framerate on fast machines without 3D assistance is rather low. Direct3D and 3Dfx support adds smooth animation on top of detailed course graphics. There's also little nuances, like transparent trees ruffling in the wind and ripples in the water -- tiny ambient details that become noticeable if the system is powerful enough to handle it.  Unfortunately, graphics alone rarely make a good golfing game. It's not that the developers didn't try -- it has the familiar three-click club swing ripped straight out of every other golf title, not to mention an easy-to-follow interface. The problem is the classic make-or-break scenario for PC golf titles: the ball physics suck. After hitting the ball, it sails into the air (or rolls on the ground, depending on whether or not you duffed it) at a particularly slow pace, almost as if the thing had been filled with helium. This is a good example of how fun gets ripped out of a golf game simply because the ball doesn't react as it should.  That's a shame, too, because this game is rather thorough in presentation. Every base has been covered: skins, stroke, and match play, amateur and pro tournament modes. Within each of the eight courses, two color commentators offer their take on the game at hand. Heck, there's even a pitch-and-putt and driving range for practicing off-season.  But even with all these options, it's just not possible to recommend Fox Sports Golf 99 over some of the true gems of the PC fairways, including EA Sports' PGA Tour series and Access' Links Pro. If only the developers worked on the way the ball moves. Well, on the plus side, we can always wait for the sequel -- after all, putting a year after the game's title almost insures that one is in the works.  -- Craig Harris", "date": "Aug 1, 1998"}
