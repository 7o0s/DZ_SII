The terrible dictator Darkstein has overtaken Europe, and it's up to a squadron of three freedom-lovin' pilots to save the day. The game spans several missions across real-world environments, such as England and Germany, each full of wave after wave of Wehrmacht.   Once you select a pilot from the hangar -- each pilot has different strengths (PT, for example, is slow but has the most powerful weapons) -- the game follows the genre's basic staples. You scoop up power-ups to increase your firepower, gain shields, or earn temporary flanking units to help spread the mayhem. In the case of Air Strike, you're joined by the two pilots you did not select. You can also bolster your hangar with 1Up icons and earn bonuses by picking up medals, usually dropped by dispatching an entire enemy pattern. You also have a megaton, screen-clearing explosive. However, you can only use one bomb at a time -- after detonating it, a bomb meter slowly refills until a new explosive is available.   Air Strike has three difficulty settings, each one offering fewer continue opportunities than the last. The easy game, with its unlimited continues, presents little challenge and should be avoided by gamers actually wanting a little value for their money. The normal setting provides 20 continues, which you might get pretty close to using as the you strike closer and closer to Darkstein's castle. Hard gives you only five continues -- only the best mobile players, with thumbs of steel that can overcome the basic drawbacks of mobile game controls, will even come close to finishing Air Strike 1944 on this setting.   Controls are usually what torpedo a mobile shooter, but Air Strike 1944 comes off pretty well. The game moves at a decent clip and the planes are pretty responsive. Auto-fire works well, thanks to a solid job of lining up enemy patterns with the rate of fire. You can get overwhelmed in the game, but it's never because your guns fire too few bullets to handle what's on-screen -- it's mainly because you didn't keep up with the patterns or properly memorize boss plane moves.   So it's technically sound -- but is it any fun? It is, at first. When the game's elements click together and you're dropping some big wings from the sky, you'll enjoy Air Strike 1944. The clever tunnel runs are a nice addition. But soon it's just to wave after wave of planes, choppers, and tanks -- but with new backdrops. And that's when you reaalize that most mobile shooters are starting to run together. If you played, say, Glu's Alpha Wing 2, then you've likely seen the best this generation of handsets can do with the category.   As expected from a Gameloft title, Air Strike 1944 looks pretty good. I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson W810i, which features a bright screen. The game has its charms, with little character portraits to accompany cheeky dialogue scenes. The planes and locations mimic the World War II era, but Gameloft employs plenty of fantasy -- check out the size of the tank boss, for example.   Coming off of Glu's superlative Alpha Wing 2, Air Strike 1944 suffers slightly by comparison. The game is good -- but never reaches greatness due to the fact is a formula shooter that follows the rulebook without err. The theme is fun and the action is certainly frantic, but halfway across Europe, your interest in reaching Darkstein may wane unless you are an absolute disciple of the genre. Gamers looking for a solid shooter will be entertained, but it just doesn't have as much ~pop~ as you would hope from a Gameloft title.", "date": "Sep 19, 2006"}
