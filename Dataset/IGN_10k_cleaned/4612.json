So instead of losing sleep over it, they did what any true players would do: they took it to the streets. They put the word out that they were looking for unsigned hype to lace up original raps about the game. Before you know it Midway was inundated with a plethora of jams, some sent from underground legends like Phife Dawg (of ATCQ, in case you didn't know),   Jurassic 5, and Supernatural, who also happens to be the MC in the game, and others were sent in by new jacks like Point Game, Raskal, and others.   The core requirement for all tracks that were eventually used in the game was that the emcees had to mention Midway, NBA Ballers, and generally have lyrical finesse that talked about basketball. For the most part, the soundtrack is laced with the music of up and comers who represent all the diverse styles of rap. Point Game kick it off with ~You A Baller, Right?~ in which a tinkling synth gurgle repeats, dipping into some darkly lit nether synth regions every now and then while a confident MC flexes his game, giving out generous props to Midway and the game itself on the chorus ~You an NBA Baller, right? Midway presents. True players get it on tonight. Gotta gift with the vertical and J in the wrist. Name another baller who can play like this~   Synth drenched beats continue on Raskal's ~Ballin Outta Control.~ This time the beat lurches and chugs under R's nasal tanged flow, cool faux symphonic keyboard snippets slipping in amidst some swirling laser fog. The mood shifts rather drastically with Nicole Marie F.CI's ~Holla At Me,~ the only R&B styled joint on the album. It's a sexual, sensual blast that ultimately feels and sounds out of place when put up next to the ruff, rugged, and raw raps that comprise the rest of the album.   Jatis, who actually represents twice on the soundtrack, first delivers ~Skills Like This,~ dedicating his rap to ~all the youngsters who gotta get their skills off, all the street ballers I know~ before he dips into rapping about crossovers and running the court. Kenny Knox goes for some horror core sounding gruffness on ~Shake The Glass,~ which rumbles along to a Halloween sounding keyboard squiggle as Knox raps like he's been gargling glass and sulfuric acid.    Synth continues to dominate the beat schematic on A Tribe Called Quest's 5-Foot Assassin's number. Phife Dawg gets down-n-dirty on ~NBA Ballers,~ stepping to the court with a decidedly battle rhyme mentality. It's a drastic change for Phife, as he renders his words with a considerable amount of verve over the ominous beat. Jelly Joe keeps the heat on with ~Floss Out,~ this time the synth augmenting into a faux Japanese stringed instrument layout. Crazy flutes kick in over the chorus giving the track some rich, layered ambiance.    Jatis returns with his second flavoring on ~Rags 2 Riches,~ in which he exclaims ~Basketball is my favorite sport~ The laid back vibe is a nice contrast to the clinky-clanky synth dominated styles that preceded it. Additionally, his liquidic flow is like a speedy breath of fresh air.   Some almost Miami Bass sounding boom gets kicked out by 4Pound on ~It'z On Now,~ which reels to a decidedly crunked out chorus. The multiple MC crew definitely instills a genuine fist-pumping-in-the-air vibe that should get players hype, if nothing else. Then the tempo shifts yet again as Jax delivers a Shaft-styled slice of blaxploitation funkness on ~We Can Do This!,~ which is one of the better tracks on the entire album.   ~I Live The Life~ is the first track to actually take elements of the gameref's whistle, the squeak of rubber on wood, cheerleader clapsand work them into the track, the squeaks, whistles, and claps all creating a creative beat over which MC Jsin Sinatra flows fluidly. Definitely the most innovative song on the entire album.    The high marks continue with ~No Boys Allowed~ by Psique, who rumbles over a wall of faux horns and a flurry of strings that give the track a forebodingly fierce ambiance that swells and swells into an intense display of rhymes that center around many of the players featured in the game from Steven Nash to Julius Irving. Supernatural's ~NBA Ballers Theme~ begins with a kind of cheesy basso chant of ~N-B-A~ and then a stutter-sung ~B-b-b-ballers,~ before 'Natch kicks in with his commanding freestyle flow over a nice bass and guitar groove, proving that he's one of the greatest unsung heroes of the game (the rap game, that is).    The final two tracks come from Iron Fist,~ whose ~Getcha Gameface On~ is a slinky slice of funk that only loses points for its brevity (it's only 1-minute and 41-seconds long!) and the indomitable Jurassic 5, who kick ~We Love Those NBA Ballers.~ It's classic J5 material, a cool and slick string imbibed groove creating a nice bed over which the J5 get mad live. Nice.   Like any compilation, the soundtrack for NBA Ballers has its share of hits and misses. The tracks that miss, well they fall like bricks. The tracks that hit, however, are like a glorious 3-pointer winning the game in the final seconds. And that's a good thing indeed.", "date": "Apr 2, 2004"}
