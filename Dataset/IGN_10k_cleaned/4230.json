Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/20/contract-jack-review", "text": "When it comes to franchises, you expect a certain consistency of feel and tone, and a certain degree of quality. No One Lives Forver and NOLF 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way were both kooky stealth-action spy games. They were known for silly characters, goofy gadgets, a storyline, and satirizing 60's spy movies. So when a game comes along that positions itself as the official prequel to NOLF 2, you'd think this trend would continue, right? Except this time from a male perspective.   Contract J.A.C.K. starts out with you tied to a chair and about to get shot execution-style. You break out, beat a guy to death, grab his gun, and proceed to lay waste to everyone in your apartment. There's lots of splashy blood and wave after wave of identical-looking enemies who appear when you trigger a spawn point.   Unfortunately, this is the game in a nutshell. Gone are the gadgets, the storyline, most of the humor and satire, most of the random overheard conversations, all of Cate Archer, stealth and dossiers scattered throughout the level. Jack is described as a contract killer--In fact, J.A.C.K. stands for ~Just Another Contract Killer,~ but only one weapon in his entire arsenal comes with a silencer, and it's a submachine gun. There's no knife, piano wire, sleeping gas, silenced pistol, or even a blackjack. Instead, you get a pump-grip shotgun with incendiary rounds, a Tommy gun, an AK-47 that can fire rounds that set people on fire, a plasma gun, frag grenades, and a crossbow and hand cannon equipped with explosive rounds. Jack is by no means a contract killer. This guy is death incarnate.   And you'll need this huge and brutal load of killing, because you'll fight more enemies in the first couple levels than I remember fighting in all of NOLF or NOLF 2. After a while, it becomes a numbing symphony of death, and you enter a zone where you're mowing them down viciously again and again and again, blowing them away with the shotgun, switching to the pistol when you run out of ammo, switching to the Tommy gun and filling them full of lead--this is nothing like NOLF. Jack barely exists as a character, and his Client, Volkov, is present only as a two-way radio connection until the very end. While there's some genuinely funny dialogue in J.A.C.K., it isn't a consistent element, and it's not worth slogging through the dull and constant combat.    The levels are incredibly linear, with your pathways artificially forced into one direction. There's the Invisible Wall in the outdoor levels, where you can't climb a modest slope off to the side. (And it doesn't help that outdoor levels have pretty dated and blocky terrain). There's the waist-high boxes and fences that your Angel of Death is ironically unable to get over. There's door after door after door that exist only as a differentiation in the wall texture (except for those doors that unexpectedly burst open with people rushing at you guns blazing).   Where the game allows exploration, things simply become confusing and frustrating, since your compass almost never has a destination on it, and there's no map, and your objective list is hopelessly vague. ~Kill the guy,~ ~Rescue the dude,~ ~Explore the base.~ Yeah, thanks.   Let's get back to the weapons for a second. First of all, your only silenced weapon is useless as a silenced weapon, since those spawn triggers send enemies coming after you before they could have possibly heard or seen you. The submachine gun is weak compared to the AK-47 and Tommy gun, but it's difficult throughout the game to have a consistent amount of ammo for these weapons. Ammo boxes store a small, randomized variety of rounds, so you'll have to kill people with the ammo you want to use for that gun. But the amount of ammo they have is also randomized. It might be a full clip, or there might be one round left. It's usually closer to one.    The Bacalov Corrector featured on the retail box with Jack holding one in each hand cannot be held akimbo and is only available at the tail end of one level, at which point you never see it again. And it has a grand total of three rounds before you're empty. The shotgun can kill an enemy in two hits at distances that would usually render buckshot no more harmful than BB pellets.   The frag grenade can set people on fire. You can only carry a maximum of two, but you can have 330 rounds of machine gun ammo. The crossbow with the explosive rounds is the closest thing you will come to a rocket or grenade launcher, and the few times you will come across it, it will have one round left. The plasma blaster is a close second, but the rounds are slow and you'll never find any ammo for it. And it only appears in one level, although it's hidden in at least one secret area later on.   So there are some issues with the weapons. Further complicating matters are the sheer endurance of your enemies. Unless you have the luxury of aiming for the head, which you won't since they'll be coming at you 2-4 at a time, expect to unload 15-20 rounds in order to take someone down, and sometimes a full clip, even with every round hitting. Expect them to fire at you and hit you even as you are filling them full of lead. You will have to quick-save after every wave, and lean around every other corner in the game unless you want to be gradually torn to shreds. Snipers will be waiting for you around corners. Groups of four or five will be waiting to ambush you, waiting behind non-interactive doors that will not open until you are standing in a wide-open space right in front of them like a sitting duck. If one or more of them is armed with a shotgun, you can be dead in one hit if standing close enough. Enemies will shoot blindly and continuously at the corner you are hiding behind, instead of firing when you show your face. The enemies in the early part of the game that are manning watchtowers are all armed with pump shotguns instead of rifles.   To their credit, they will flush you out with well-placed grenades if you hunker down for too long. They will take cover, raise their arm over an obstruction and spray randomly, avoid friendly fire, and spread out. But it becomes apparent after a while that when they take cover, swing out and fire, then swing back, that they're just following a drone pattern which you could almost set your watch to. They fire for a couple seconds, hide, then you pop up, they swing out, you unload and take a few bullets from them. They also don't take the best cover. Some of them will run behind potted trees, or a low obstruction that leaves the top of their head exposed. They also don't run away from grenades.   When you can pick up NOLF and NOLF 2 in the bargain bin for less than J.A.C.K., combined, there's no compelling reason to recommend J.A.C.K. If you want contract killing from a male perspective, Hitman 2 will give you a superior experience, and is also in the bargain bin at a fraction of the price. You'll also get more than five hours of playtime. J.A.C.K. contains seven different areas, with the last one seeming almost interminable, but you can still get through it in one sitting. There's multiplayer, with the usual deathmatch, team deathmatch and CTF, but Call of Duty is superior here, too, for only ten dollars more. At the end of the day, J.A.C.K. feels like a throwback to the old ways of action gaming that the genre moved beyond a while ago, from the dated graphics to the trigger spawns to the tiresomely repeated music.", "date": "Nov 20, 2003"}
