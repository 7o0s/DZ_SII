Actually, first person stealther is probably a better way to describe the gameplay. It was no surprise then that it barely made a dent in the charts. The Darkness, also made by Starbreeze, is in some ways the spiritual successor to Riddick.It's got a very similar look and feel, and even ties the concept of light and shadow into the gameplay, albeit in a different manner than Riddick. But in other ways, it's a very different game - unlike Riddick, you don't skulk about in the shadows to avoid wandering guards or deadly prisoners. In The Darkness, shadows are all about attacking, gathering the power of the inky depths to give you the strength to rip the still-beating heart out of the dumb mobster in front of you. It's much more of a straight shooter than Riddick ever was, probably in an attempt to make it a more accessible game than the cerebral Riddick. But can it fill the Vin Diesel-sized boots of Starbreeze's last project?If you're a fan of the incredibly gory comic books, you'll know all about the game's main protagonist, Jackie Estacado. A 21-year old hit-man with the gravely voice of a two pack-a-day, 40-year old, he's led the stereotypical life of a Mafia Assassin. Raised in an orphanage, adopted by evil mobster uncle, blah, blah. But in a unique twist on the hitman origin story, on his 21st birthday Jackie discovers that he's been possessed by a demonic force known as The Darkness.   Voice wonderfully by Mike Patton and an army of synthesised filters, The Darkness is the true star of the game (Update - 2k Games just let us know that there were no voice filters used. The Darkness is pure Patton, which is simply astonishing... and a little scary). Where Jackie seems a little wooden and  clichd, The Darkness is a truly menacing and interesting personality. Just when you think The Darkness is kind of nice in an evil mentor kind of way, it toys with the player's expectations, forcing Jackie to go through the most disturbing scene in the game. It's animated beautifully as well, in the form of tentacles that protrude from Jackie's shoulders, each with a serpent-like head. They whip and sway as living entities, and even fight over the hearts of fallen prey. It's their powers that separate The Darkness from your run of the mill shooter. As the game progresses, you'll unlock a number of them, turning you from an already bad-assed assassin into a bulldozer of unstoppable violence. The first power, creep, allows you to detach a small tentacle which then slithers through the environment, like a remote-controlled drone but with the ability to bite off people's faces. They're great for recon, stealth-kills and the occasional mundane puzzle-solving section. Unfortunately they're marred by some awkward, sticky controls, often getting snagged on the environment and the corpses that will inevitably fill it. You'll soon get another ability which allows you to whip things with your tentacles, be it people, cars, boxes and lights. They're really only useful for taking out lights, allowing you to conserve bullets for more important things, like busting heads.   Next up are The Darkness guns, two rather odd looking pistols that can take down most enemies with a single shot. Due to the fact that they run on Darkness powers, you'll use them when your regular guns run out of ammo. Finally, the coolest ability by far is the Black Hole power. This casts a giant vacuum of an orb wherever you point it, sucking anything and everything into a spaghettified mess. The only problem is that it's too powerful - for the last half of the game we relied on this power for 90% of our kills. The Darkness tentacles rely on a Heart Foundation-approved diet of hearts. Stand next to a fallen foe, tap the A button and watch as they rip out the heart, gulping it down with glee. The more hearts you eat, the more your powers are heightened. If only real life was this easy!All of these Darkness powers are fed by, you guessed it, being in the dark! Stand in the light and you'll hear the tentacles start to sizzle, before they disappear completely. But shoot out the lights around you, and you'll see the tentacles inhaling energy from the shadows, powering up to their full capacity.     As well as your tentacles of doom, The Darkness allows you to control cute little critters called Darklings, which come in four demonic flavours. Gunners pack a chaingun, Kamikazes explode around enemies and pre-scripted puzzles, Light Killers helpfully blow out light globes (and the odd enemy) while the Berserker is all about hands-on, skull-chewing killing. They can really help out when it comes to clearing an area, but have a few limitations. It's never clear how many more you can spawn before existing Darklings start dying, and they have invisible boundaries which they simply won't cross. Still, the way they defile corpses by peeing in their faces is kind of endearing, and their amusing banter is some of the best dialogue in the game. While you'll probably rely on the Darkness abilities for most of your killing, it'd be a shame not to use the gun-based weaponry when you can. Many of the guns are dual-wield capable, with each trigger on the 360 controller corresponding to a gun. Dual-wielding two sub-machine guns and cutting up the environment is a truly satisfying experience.   In fact, for the first few hours at least, the action in The Darkness will have you thinking this game is the second coming for action fans. Combat has a meaty, gutsy feel to it that is lacking from many games, thanks to a combination of great visuals, booming sound effects, the dual wield and Darkness powers and a healthy bucket or two of blood. As you unlock more powers, and get access to bigger, better guns, you'll feel like you're a god amongst men, mowing through the bad guys like a dog armed with a machine gun in a barn full of kittens. You'll be pumping your fist into the air, screaming at the decimated corpses of the vanquished, asking them ~Who's the boss? Who's the man? I F$%#@G AM YOU B@#!@S!~. It's an explosive testosterone-fest.  Sadly, this feeling only lasts for the first few hours of the game. Considering how much we absolutely loved these hours, we're still trying to figure out why the game stopped being so satisfying, so abruptly. Could it be the incredibly linear and bland level design? The game plays out in a micro-sized chunk of New York, which is broken down into even smaller sections, all accessed via a subway system comprised of two stations. Moving between each section results in a lengthy loading time, although this is disguised by a pretty cool cutscene of Jackie delivering a few lines. The tiny city section is broken up by travelling into another, far more interesting area, but these sections are limited, and just as linear. We won't go into detail about this area, as discovering it is one of the game's highlights, but we will say that it's one of the most disturbing gaming environments we've visited. But even with this ~other place~, there's very little variety to the game's environments, and even less freedom.Perhaps the reason that we started to feel the evil weight of repetition atop our Darkness tentacles was the fact that there was little to no variety in the action. Every single encounter played out the same way. Enter an area. Shoot out the lights. Power up Darkness. Unleash Black Hole/machine gun fire/Darklings. Eat hearts. Enter next area. If the AI wasn't so brain-dead, we could forgive the above-mentioned faults. F.E.A.R. had similar issues, but its brilliant AI meant that each fire-fight played out differently. Not so in The Darkness. They tend to just stand around, waiting for you to enter the area, and then they'll do the only thing they're capable of - shoot back at you. Occasionally they'll move around a little, but their behaviour is more reminiscent of ducks in a shooting gallery rather than hardened warriors. Check out our US Video Review of The Darkness.Some gamers might be able to overlook these flaws, as the combat is still quite a satisfying experience. But in the crowded first person shooter genre we at IGN want more variety, more innovation - not puzzles where we have to pull a lever, or one of the worst on-rails sections we've ever played.Don't think the multiplayer is going to save the game's longevity either. The concept of humans versus Darklings is kind of cool, but it's let down by very laggy netcode and the fact that humans feel so much more powerful.Jaime Griesemer, lead designer on Halo and Halo 2, used the following sentence to describe why the Halo games were so enjoyable, there was maybe 30 seconds of fun that happened over and over and over again, so if you can get 30 seconds of fun, you can pretty much stretch that out to be an entire game if you don't nail that 30 seconds, you're not gonna have a great game.It seems that this sentence became the mission statement at the core of The Darknesss design, to its detriment. Halo might be based around that 30 second concept, but it takes that crucial half minute across new environments, with new bad guys and new things to do. Unfortunately for The Darkness, it adheres to the 30-second rule too strictly, with a severe lack of variety casting a dark shadow over an otherwise great action title.", "date": "Jun 28, 2007"}
