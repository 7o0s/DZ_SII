{"name": "24: The Mobile Game", "name_review": "24", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/02/10/24", "text": "Yes. Now, this is how you do a licensed movie/TV game on mobile.   The concept of 24: The Game is very similar to Atari's Enter the Matrix -- instead of just mirroring events from the source material, the developers tried to give you a side experience that complimented the action that you already knew all about. But the developers of 24 learned from Enter the Matrix's biggest mistake: You never really got to interact with the favorite character in the source material: Neo. In 24, you are very much in communication with Jack Bauer, so that instead of feeling like you're doing something completely removed from the hero, you are riding into battle right alongside of him.   Of course, it helps the entire 24 experience is actually set up quite well for a mobile game. Everybody in the show uses technology, so you hovering over a cellphone and working alongside Jack and Chloe doesn't seem that foreign of an idea. That initial connection with the ~realm~ of the show is pivotal to the game's success.   You play as a new member of the Los Angeles CTU office. When you start out, you're just in time to start investigating some unsettling chatter over unauthorized channels. Chloe brings you up to speed, getting you used to the rhythm and flow of the game before you finally meet Jack and things start snowballing. A terrorist plot is underway (surprise!) and it's up to the CTU to defuse the situation -- and what's cool, is that it's not entirely up to you. (Just mostly.) Because you exist alongside characters like Jack and Chloe that know how to do their jobs, you can count on them to do certain things on their own.   24 never devolves into a basic action game. Instead, the plot (which was written by actual scribes on the series -- and it shows) is unspooled through a series of mini-games. Each mini-game is an activity that would make sense for the CTU team to tackle. Some of them are more puzzle oriented, such as decoding messages, cutting bomb wires, and cracking security measures on a computer through a color-coded sequence. There are certainly several action scenes, too. When you assign an agent to investigate a site in Los Angeles, you monitor traffic from above and help ~steer~ them through ridiculous LA traffic.   There are also stealth scenes where you use a thermal reading to direct agents into hostile locations. These play out kind of like Metal Gear Solid-to-go. Guards have vision cones you must avoid.  There are security cameras to carefully step around and sleeping darts you can use to knock out enemies when their backs are turned. (Wow, MGS game play without the need to sit through 30-minute cutscenes? Thanks, I-play!) There are actual gun play scenes, but these move as slow and methodical as the stealth sequences, and I didn't necessarily think they worked as well as some of the other sequences.    The game clock counts down exactly like the show, with each game play episode consisting of an hour or so in the plot's timeline. Of course, the timeline is slightly truncated to make sense on mobile. You can play an hour's worth of action in just a few minutes -- which is great for gamers that want to sneak in a mission while on the bus or between meetings. Now, you can sit there and play through the entire ~season~ (and that's what the game feels like -- a season of the show distilled in a little more than an hour of game play) if so inclined. But since the plot is naturally broken apart in bite-sized portions, it's easy to stop and start several times while weaving through the plot.   24 offers a reward system for players. Each episode is timed and making a mistake costs you precious minutes. At the end of the adventure, your entire time is totaled and you are awarded a badge for your performance. Because the overall game doesn't take that long to complete (if you played it in one sitting that is), there is reason to go back and try again to be a better CTU agent without too much of a time sink.   And that's another one of the many slick aspects of 24 -- it's really a casual game at heart. The entire thing can be played with just a single thumb, but because the consequences (according to the plot) are so dire, it doesn't feel like you're just burning time with something like Tetris. But even though it feels a little more ~hardcore~ in places, it doesn't require the amount of time of more traditional action-arcade games.   24 doesn't dazzle with incredible graphics -- they mainly just get the job done. While I would have enjoyed a little more detail (I tested on a couple handsets, including a Sony Ericsson 710), the game doesn't require it to be enjoyable. As long as you can understand the puzzle screens and see the heat signatures in the stealth sequences, you can handle the task at hand. However, it does feature portraits of the shows stars -- including Kiefer Sutherland -- and that means a lot in something like this. It's one thing to have the game tell you you're ~talking~ to Jack Bauer, it's another to actually see the face of the character. Fans have developed an emotional attachment to the character, and since television and games are a visual medium, it completes the connection to see the actors.  So, why am I giving 24 such a high score? Because it is the best example of a licensed mobile game based on an entertainment property (film, TV show) that I have seen thus far. Rather than going to simple route and making a cookie-cutter action-platformer starring Jack Bauer, I-play successfully created the illusion that you are a pivotal member of the CTU team working alongside your favorite characters from the show. This is a way to augment your enjoyment of the show -- and that's a really cool concept.I also feel the game has significant replay value. If you are a fan of the show, it's apparent you enjoy spending time with these people each week. After finishing one of the days in 24, I think a lot of fans/gamers will feel inclined to go back and see if they cannot beat their past times, see if they cannot be a bigger help to Jack, and enjoy the story one more time. This is solid, smart mobile gaming that is easily worth the admission price for fans of the series.And I hear there are quite a few of them.", "date": "Feb 10, 2006"}
