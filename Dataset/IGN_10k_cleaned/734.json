In fact, did Acclaim improve the ECW game at all, or did they just shell out another roughshod hack and expect it to sell just because it's a wrestling game? Here's the play-by-play:  Tonight's Match-up: ECW vs WWF!  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the match you've been waiting five whole months for! The champion, WWF Attitude, is looking a little worse for wear after being on shelves just a couple of months. The chunky graphics, the stuttery gameplay... the champ just doesn't look much like a champ anymore. But the challenger, ECW Hardcore... well, it looks a lot like his opponent, and ECW hasn't even stepped into the ring yet. Yes, this should be a very hard-fought match, because these two are evenly-matched mediocre wrestlers. Let's go down to ringside! Entrances It looks like another sold-out show here tonight -- that's right, all two rows of crowd sprites are jam-packed to capacity in this otherwise empty arena. And already, it looks like ECW is the same game as Attitude. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding... of course, they also say that only babies and geezers eat pudding.  Now lumbering down to ringside is WWF Attitude. And what an entrance it is -- the wrestlers really looks like their true-life counterparts. Now if only the camera weren't placed in far off Nova Scotia, we would be able to see some of this action.  And walking in after Attitude is ECW Hardcore. Well, surprise, surprise, surprise. It's the same entrance as Attitude, only without the charisma of the WWF superstars. But still, you can't say that the wrestlers don't look like their real-life counterparts... unfortunately. ECW now steps up to the ring, and notice that the ring ropes are now black instead of red. A tremendous improvement, but -- oh no! There's the rope clipping, ladies and gentlemen, and it's is just as horrible as last time! This does not bode well for the newcomer.  The wrestlers square off, eye to eye. Attitude says a clever little quip, and the crowd goes wild because they actually know who the hell these guys are. Now EWC takes the mike -- it looks like the camera department has decided to shoot this sequence from the rafters for some odd reason, but I say the farther away and more awkward the camera angle the better. And here's the quote -- it's a garbly, out of context phrase with no lip synch. Wow, almost a windfall, and they haven't even tied up yet.  Gameplay  That's the bell, and this thing is underway. Already we see that ECW Hardcore hasn't learned a damn thing from its time at The Power Plant, because this is the same tap-tappity-tap combo wrestling that we've seen since Warzone. Each opponent is dialing in a devastating combination -- it looks like ECW has strung together an amazing eighty-four taps, so this should be amazing -- and, it's an arm bar. Well, that's not exactly what we were hoping for, but Attitude isn't doing much better. Or any better. In fact, they've got all the same moves. It's a good thing players have memorized these talentless combos from playing these wresting games for years now, because neither game is any fun until one has committed to memory all of the moves.  It looks like ECW has thrown down WWF. And he's back on his feet. Now ECW is down on the mat. And back up again. It looks like both competitors play very unrealistically, with too-fast fighting that doesn't let a player feel like they're winning. Let's watch to see if ECW at least sells the moves so you believe these guys are getting hurt -- no, they just get up, like a couple of marionettes. Still, I have never seen as many nut punches thrown in a wrestling game. Now if only these wrestlers acted like this hurt, this would be heaven!  Things do not look good for ECW. The collision detection is like wrestling with a waterfall, and the AI is bone stupid. Just look -- the steel cage has been lowered from the rafters, but the AI opponent is too dumb to climb out when an opponent is down on the mat. The wrestling is not at all based on timing, and the gameplay is  dial-a-combo battling, just like Attitude -- only nobody cares about ECW. I see that somebody has replaced the ring ropes with barbed wire -- we haven't seen this since Data East's World Heroes (which isn't the greatest game to copy from). Unfortunately, none of the other ECW signatures -- the fire, the in-the-audience battles, the drama -- has made the transition. In fact, there are no other significant additions to the option menu besides barbed wire -- everything from Attitude has simply been carried over and renamed. Weapons are being tossed in now, and both opponents bend undignified at the waist to pick up their tool of destruction. And, yes, every weapon is a blocky, crappy object with no detail or differentiating quality. They both swing -- and both thud loudly across each other's empty noggins! They're both down on the mat together!  Graphics  While they're down, let's get a closer look at these two competitors. It looks like there is some bulbous thing growing out of the backside of both wrestlers, and we have now determined that this is, in fact, their enormous asses. Again, the butts are twice the men, and the same can be said about these very mannish ladies. Just look at those gigantic booties! Sir Mix-a-Lot once said, ~My anaconda don't want none unless you've got buns, hun~, but in this case I still think my anaconda is saying no thanks.  There's another something showing up on these wrestlers bodies in ECW. From this distance, I can't tell if that's a tumorous cancer growth, a badly botched tattoo, or blood. A quick look in the manual, and yes, we have confirmed -- that is supposed to be blood. And I think that thing on the wrestlers head is also supposed to be their face. Again, let's turn to the manual -- no, it doesn't say exactly what those washed-out textures are supposed to be. How unfortunate.  But, if there is one thing that can be said about ECW, it's that it certainly won't offend those who are color blind -- they're not missing a thing with ECW's four-tone pallet. Maybe that's why the sound department in this game doesn't have color commentary. But, here at IGN we do have a color man -- ~I'm not so sure what pinko commie country this Austin, Texas is where ECW Hardcore hails from, but this here is America, the land of the red, white, and blue. Around these parts we like this color thing. And we like our color like we like our women -- brassy, sassy, and with a whole mess of sisters. ECW had about much color as an episode of Hee-Haw. There's blue on the ground, black on the ring ropes, blood on the bodies, and bleagh in the crowd.~ Wow, harsh words, but if ever one deserved it, it would be ECW Hardcore.  Sound  It looks like both combatants have suddenly jumped back to their feet as if nothing had happened, and are rearing to go again. Listen to that capacity crowd roar. The crowd is realistic in both games, but what's this coming from ECW? Ohhh, it's foul language! That's poor sportsmanship, but I'll allow it.  Still, you can't help but notice that nothing in this ECW game sounds like it's really coming from the game. The chants and cheers come up when the heat is building , but the wrestlers don't move their mouths or bodies when they speak. Again, WWF Attitude matches the newcomer fairly, but the champ has the advantage of having interesting characters and clever, funny lines. This ECW tries to talk the talk, but nothing really comes across better than mush-mouth garbling and gratuitous cursing. Let's turn you back to our color man -- ~Well lookie here boys, it's a wrastlin' game that swears! HOOOO-WHEE, well if that don't beat all. Only it don't beat all, because every sound in the game sounds like it's coming from the neighbors house two doors away.  Body slam effects, wrestler voices (coming from lips that don't move), audience shout-outs -- everything sounds like it was recorded at Roseanne's house last Christmas and then synched up by Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles.~  We turn now to the commentator of the game, who seems to have just joined the match. That's right folks, the man's calls come about a half hour later than a pizza boy. This is really a surprise, seeing that Acclaim has eschewed the two-man booth that made WWF Attitude's commentary so fun. ECW goes for a move, and the announcer Joey Styles has come up with ~Awww, come on!~ Now, off the top rope, and the commentary comes back with ~Awww, come on!~ A low blow! What will Joey have to say about that?  ~Awww, come on!~ Very creative.  The Final WordIt looks like ECW Hardcore is, in fact, a lesser Attitude in every way. Honestly, I have to wonder how the decision is going to go. These two are so evenly matched because they are, in fact, twin brothers! Amazing, but I think that comes as a shock to none. What do you think, color man?~That's exactly right, and let me put my two cents in here. I'm not saying that these ECW boys couldn't rise up if they had a better game to showcase what makes ECW the EC-dub that these fans love. But right now this is the same game as WWF Attitude, and that's like going to see Star Wars and getting Wing Commander tickets instead -- same genre, but if I wanted tickets to that piece of crap I would have beat it out of the box office attendant! WWF Attitude was a weak game, but it had style. ECW has about as much style as a White Horse Cafe marathon.~True enough, and it seems like the match is going to go to Attitude because it has more interesting characters, better graphics, more fitting gameplay, better audio... What's this! ECW has five goatees in the Create-A-Wrestler mode to WWF Attitude's four! What an upset! Ladies and gentlemen, I have never seen anything like this! The crowd is standing on its feet -- OK, these crappy sprites never sat down in the first place -- but still, five goatees! What a stunner! I just can't believe they're calling ECW the winner. He looked so bad out there, but apparently the judges bought it anyway. This is just... DEAR LORD! Are you seeing what I see? WWF Smackdown has run down to ringside and is taking on both challengers! This is unprecedented! Oh no, Smackdown has both ECW and WWF by the neck, ready for a choke slam! Can THQ pull this off! Will the slam go down! And we are all out of time -- what will happen? Wrestling fans, you can't miss this! Tune in next week to find out what happens! My God, is Smackdown going to do it! Oh, the humanity!!!", "date": "Feb 24, 2000"}
