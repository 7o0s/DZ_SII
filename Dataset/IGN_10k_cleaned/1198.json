It brings a lot more to Age of Empires II than we expected and it does it all while preserving the character of the original. The game does alter a few rules and modifies a few units, but it's all done for the sake of more balanced gameplay. We've already written an extensive preview of the game and provided you with campaign overviews straight from the team at Ensemble. So we're not going to go into tons of detail about the basics here. But just to recap, there have been some notable additions to the game in terms of AI, a lessening of administrative headaches and a whole bunch of new races, units and technologies.  The new races are the most intriguing thing about the game. Five new civilizations have been added to the original thirteen included in the basic game. Overall, they fill in some holes left by the earlier civilizations. The Huns have excellent cavalry bonuses and are adept at lightning quick attacks on structures. They also do not need houses to support their population. The Spanish civilization is also predominated by horses and uses them as mounts for cannoneers and monks. Their technological superiority as well as their gold collection and construction bonuses makes them ideal for building elaborate cities. The Aztecs and Mayans both suffer from a lack of cavalry but both also have excellent foot substitutes. The Mayans also have an exceptional ranged unit in the Plumed Archer. The Aztecs benefit from shortened unit production time and gold collection bonuses. Last come the Koreans, whose emphasis on defense will put any attacker to the test. A few extra units have been included for all the civilizations as well. Halberdiers and Hussars are improved versions of Pikemen and Light Cavalry while Petards offer a cheap alternative to cumbersome siege weapons.  Each race also has its own unique technologies but for the most part, these just tend to fall into military advancements. The one exception is the Hunnish Atheism. This advance increases the time it takes rivals to construct wonders and halves the cost of Hunnish spies and treason. More interesting are the universal technologies added to the game. Bloodlines and Parthian Tactics are purely military advances, but there are some more subtle advances that you might want to concentrate on. Caravans increase the speed of trading vessels and Herbal Medicine helps garrisoned units heal faster. More impressive are the two religious advances -- Theocracy and Heresy. Theocracy allows you to convert enemy units while only forcing one Monk to loose faith. Heresy makes it impossible for enemy monks to convert your units. Instead of going over to the other side, your units merely die when converted.  The game comes with three six-mission campaigns. You should already know about the Attila the Hun Campaign, the Montezuma Campaign, and the El Cid Campaign. (Isn't saying the El Cid a little redundant?) In any case, each of the campaigns offers loads of new challenges for the seasoned Age player. As Attila the Hun, you'll have to refine your hit and run cavalry tactics as you scour across the fields of Central Europe. Montezuma will have to cope with the Aztec's lack of cavalry as he fights off the Spanish in dense tropical jungles. The Spanish leader El Cid must learn to fight with two very different types of armies -- the Spanish and the Moors. I was really irritated to see that there aren't any new campaigns for the Mayans or the Koreans, but there's so much else here, I can't really complain. I should also mention that a new tab has been added to the campaign overview button to tell you who your enemies are and where they're located.  The fourth campaign is just a loose selection of battles from the medieval period (although a few of them are really pushing into the Renaissance). The battles are a great quick fix for those of you who don't want to get too deep into the campaigns, but because they're so much shorter, they can kind of seem a little superficial and unrewarding. That's not to say they aren't well designed -- they've got lots of interesting mission variety. Lepanto, Tours and Noryang force you on the defensive as you fight off wave after wave of enemy attack. Agincourt and Kyoto present different challenges as you try to rescue your hero from being overwhelmed by enemies. Vinlandsaga you must help Erik the Red establish a colony in the ~New World.~ Hastings and Manzikert are a lot more straightforward in that you must eliminate every living thing from the face of the earth. Remember that speech Mr. Teasedale gives at the beginning of Red Dawn? That's the kind of thing we're talking about here.  On the multiplayer and skirmish side of things, The Conquerors looks just as good. There are three brand new multiplayer game types. Although they're not really that interesting to me personally, they do offer a nice way to mix up the standard deathmatches of the previous game. In King of the Hill, you must maintain control of a Wonder in the center of the map. The Defend the Wonder game type begins late in the Imperial Age with tons of resources, units and technology. Now it's up to you to defend your Wonder from your enemies. This is a really great kickstart kind of setup. In the Wonder Race game, you and your enemies must compete to build a Wonder without ever coming to blows with each other. I know, I know, but some people like that kind of stuff. Like I said, these new game types aren't really my thing, but it is nice to have some other options when you're squaring off online. There are also some new advanced allied commands that are quite useful.  The new maps are good as well. Eight new maps and ten ~real world~ maps add a lot of variety to the multiplayer experience. The eight new maps are more like traditional levels in a shooter with all kinds of boundaries and limitations on movement. The importance of a strong naval force is a little better here than in the previous maps as well. The ten real world maps are based on locations as diverse as Texas and Norway. The maps are really nice but take a lot of geographic liberties for the sake of gameplay. By far, the best thing about the maps in this game are the inclusion of tropical and winter tilesets. Now you can get your Age on in dense jungles or frozen fjords.  One of my biggest complaints against Age of Empires II was that the villagers were often kind of thick-headed. I don't want them totally autonomous but sometimes they just didn't seem to take any steps to make things more convenient for me. Not so in The Conquerors -- these villagers are much smarter. Not only will they automatically begin harvesting a resource after building a resource camp. And when you order a resource gathering villager to construct a new building, they'll drop off their resources before going to construct the new building. The Conquerors also eases the horrible farm replanting headache that plagued the previous game. Now you can queue up 15 replants at your Mill. As a farm runs out, the Mill automatically replants it, leaving you to focus on kicking your enemies' into the dust.  There are a lot of other balancing issues in the game -- units changes, new civilizations restrictions and possibilities but if we went into everything that's new about this game, we'd be here all night. All too often expansions are just an excuse to cash in on a game's popularity and innovation almost seems to be an afterthought. I won't say that The Conquerors takes AOE to some whole new level -- it doesn't. But what it does is enlarge the game a little beyond its original scope. And even more surprising, manages to preserve the fun and enjoyment of the original without being a simple mission pack. The big question here is whether or not you liked Age of Empires II. If you did then Conquerors is more of what you love minus a lot of the management frustrations and with a whole lot more options.  -- Stephen Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
