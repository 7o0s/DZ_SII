{"name": "Zapper: One Wicked Cricket", "name_review": "Zapper", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/05/zapper", "text": "is a videogame hero without an original bone in his body. Which I guess makes it appropriate that he's a cricket (no bones, geddit?). In this Game Boy Advance game (which is a portable version of a recently released console title), Infogrames, Blitz Games, and Atomic Planet work together to essentially recreate the original Frogger arcade game in a brand new adventure. And considering the Game Boy Advance already has several versions of Frogger in official form, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to bringing this game to market. Especially since it doesn't really do anything better than what Konami has already done with the ~hop-and-dodge~ gameplay for the handheld...and a few cases, it's a little worse. But at least it has single cartridge multiplayer! Features 20 different levels Link cable support for four players (single cartridge) Cartridge save (Three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Zapper's a cricket with a problem. His little brother Zipper, a grub of a cricket, has been kidnapped by Maggie the magpie and carted off to her nest. Why the little guy wasn't immediately turned into bird food isn't exactly made clear, but regardless, it's up to Zapper to get hopping through the different challenges, picking up orbs, tokens and Maggie's eggs in order to get back his brother. Zapper really doesn't try to be anything more than what Frogger has already become on the Game Boy Advance. The gameplay of this cricket's adventure is the same, where players must hop one tile at a time through different, patterned hazards like snails, masked beaver/squirrel hybrids, bees, and other strange Zapper universe critters. There are five different words of 20 total Frogger style levels, each with the same goal: Hop through the area while collecting six eggs, a hundred blue orbs and 20 yellow orbs. The yellow orbs have to be collected in a specific order; if you don't follow the order, the yellow orbs will turn into blue tokens...and then you're screwed. Zapper can also jump two blocks for extra far leaps, as well as utilize his electrical antennae to zap open boxes or enemies; his electricity ability must be charged by power-ups to destroy stronger objects and enemies. If all of the levels in a world have been completed 100 percent, players can head into a bonus round for even more points and extra lives.  The standard levels in Zapper drag on a little too long for its own good, and they tend to get a bit stale and boring during the challenges. Worse still, in some cases the designers force players to go through the same level twice because some orbs, locked away in a vending machine, cannot be acquired until the orbs have been collected in later levels The graphic layout, an overhead perspective, is a little awkward to look at, and most of that can be attributed to the fact that the Zapper character doesn't have a shadow to help with the illusion of depth. While the scenery and level design rise and fall in a semi-3D fashion, it's extremely difficult to see exactly where Zapper will land simply because he doesn't have a shadow to guide the players on where he's bouncing. Players can definitely get used to the game's look in these levels, but it will always look like something's missing.  To its credit, the game does offer a little more variety by borrowing from another videogame for a different take on the hopping levels. Anyone who ever played Tower Toppler on the Atari 7800 or Nebulous on the NES (or computer incarnation) will recognize the few clever challenges in Zapper where players must work their way up a tree by hopping around on leaves clinging to the bark. Zapper will always remain in the middle of the screen as the tree rotates around; it's a neat effect and a nice way to change up the hopping gameplay...but it's far from an original idea.  All of the levels, once completed, can be re-entered in arcade mode where players can challenge their best times. Where the game shines, though, is in its multiplayer option. Players only need one copy of the game to take advantage of a nice variety of competition levels against other friends on other GBA systems. Zipper Soccer is a simple sport where players try to hurl the Zipper icon into one of the two open goals; getting zapped by the other player will cause him to drop the Zipper. Stranglehold puts players to the challenge of holdign onto Zipper for the longest amount of time.  Deathmatch and Last Man Standing are pretty self explanatory modes. All of these modes are fun, but they're all based within the same overhead graphics engine of the main adventure, so Zapper still doesn't have a shadow.  The single player adventure is a pale, watered-down clone of Frogger that doesn't come quite as close to what Konami has already done with that property. The standard levels in Infogrames game are somewhat dull and lifeless with bland graphics and animation, but at least the developer spiced things up with clever FMV bonus minecart levels and the Tower Toppler challenges. The multiplayer support is what's the real winner here, giving the game something original to share with other GBA owners without the need for extra copies. Konami's Frogger Adventures series eats this cricket for lunch, though, so unless you can't get enough of the bouncy-bouncy gameplay, stick with the classic Frogger.", "date": "Dec 5, 2002"}
