That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.   Now that we're officially out of the 90s, it's OK to start getting nostalgic, and there's no better place to start than 1992. On top of fantastic hits like X-Wing and Star Control, you had not one, not two, but three genre breakers that went on to define gaming in the 90s, and into the new millennium.  Wolfenstein 3D created first-person shooter fans where there had previously just been ~action gamers,~ Alone in the Dark taught people that a controlled camera and a good storyline could make for some good ~survival horror,~ and last but certainly not least, Dune II put a ticking clock into turn-based action and changed strategy gaming forever.  Dune II is arguably the first RTS game, but more importantly, it's the first RTS game to spark what is now considered a core genre of PC gaming. As hard as it is to believe now, there was truly nothing like it, and almost 10 years later, everything from Homeworld to Dark Reign still builds upon the foundations put down by Dune II. Although the game was played out in realtime, that was far from the only innovation that made the game so memorable. Dune II was a complete package, and one that still holds up under the microscope, even under the gaze of our RTS-addled brains of this new century.  Don't let the ~II~ in the title fool you -- Dune II was completely unrelated (other than by license) to the original game. Virgin Interactive had picked up the Dune license, and was to release a set of games, the first of which was developed by Cryo, and the second developed by Westwood. Dune II had you playing as one of three races battling for spice and power on the sand planet Arrakis. House Atreides and House Harkonnen were familiar to readers of the novels, while House Ordos was a new race created by Westwood for the game. The game was quick to get into. Once you selected your race, you popped into a map and began to build resources and units, and take out those nasty enemy troops. While on the surface the game was familiar to other strategy games of the time, it only took a few minutes of gameplay to prove just how different it really was.  First off, you had the realtime gameplay -- it was just more alive than turn-based games. While you still had to worry about managing troops and building units, like in Civilization, you didn't have the luxury of thinking over your decisions for seconds, or even minutes. How you placed a structure, and where you sent your units had an immediate effect on the gameplay that was felt moments after your decisions, and because of this you were suddenly forced to think on your feet if you wanted to survive a mission. You had all the momentum of action games, but without dumbing down the strategy elements involved.  Then there was the structure building concept, where you were actually in control of how, when and where you placed your structures. No longer was your focus simply on how to attack the enemy; suddenly it was up to you to decide how important a Spice Silo was over the Barracks. If you were stuck in the corner of the map, what was the best way to lay out your structure for maximum defense/offense? It was up to you to figure it out for yourself. Plus there was the resource tree, something that had been implemented the previous year in Civilization, but was put to use brilliantly in Dune II. The structures you built would give you access to bigger, better and just plain new structures that were key to winning campaigns.  You also had race-specific units and special abilities, something that would become a Westwood trademark in the Command & Conquer series, and be honed to perfection in Blizzard titles such as Starcraft. Atreides had powerful Sonic Tanks, the Ordos had the Saboteurs who could destroy structures or vehicles, and the Harkonnen had the deadly Devastator, to name but a few. While we take replayability in games for granted nowadays with extra bits like Multiplayer and skirmish maps just part of the standard package, to be able to play the game through as the three races, each with unique special units and weapons, was a fantastic addition. Unfortunately, you weren't able to try all of these devious strategies and attacks out on your friends, as multiplayer in 1992 meant having your friend get you a coke while you played. Still, the computer AI was strong for the time, and the open-ended structure in each campaign meant that you could spent tons of time just honing your skills and trying out new techniques, something that many fans did, and still do in popular strategy games. What realtime really brought to the strategy genre was technique, the ability to use your reflexes and brainpower to react to situations on the fly.   The in-game graphics were solid for the time, but the opening movie was truly impressive with its limited animation, and graphic representations of the units, worms and races. And sound actually matched lips! If you were lucky enough to own a high-end sound card at the time, you could receive verbal warnings when an enemy approached, or confirmation of your commands to your units, on top of the voice-filled intro, all of which was squeezed onto four slim little 3.5 disks. Once again, these simple concepts have now become standard when it comes to RTS gaming... something we take for granted nowadays.  Unfortunately, licensing problems kept there from ever being a Dune 3 (we're gently going to ignore Dune 2000), but most of you have seen the structure and feel of that game in a different form. The development team decided to create a new license for what was to be Dune 3, and in 1995 Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn was born. One look at the multitude of C&C expansions will tell you just how much the public actually minded losing the license -- but it's still sad to think that the rich storyline of the Dune universe could have continued throughout the 90s, given the success of the original game.   The game definitely has its flaws in retrospect, particularly the odd command interface (you have to click on a unit, then on a command, then on location) and the lack of a coherent grouping feature, but despite those flaws, the game still holds up to some of the best RTS games out there. Despite the older graphics, and in spite of the limited AI, what made Dune II great in '92 is still what makes it great now -- flavor, and fun.  -- Vincent Lopez Presentation  The opening movie still looks clean, and the characters actually talk, and sound moves with the their lips! Who woulda thunk it? The box is still one of my favorites.   8.5  Graphics  The characters could be a bit more detailed, and the sand motif is definitely repetitious -- but the menu screens are very nice.   7.0  Sound  The music is dynamic, responding to your gameplay, and the voice technology plays a big part of how the game is played (~your base is being attacked from the east~). More than just music, the sound in Dune II adds a lot to your experience.   9.0  Gameplay  While the AI certainly isn't as advance as some of today's big games, the simplicity matches the structure. Dune II is a solid, fun, and frantic experience, and even today, it'll grab you from the first few minutes you play. The nostalgia rush alone is worth giving this one another spin.   9.5  Lasting Appeal  Despite the fact that you've got three different races to play with, there are still only nine missions to experience with them, and each is fairly small in scope and size. You'll definitely play this one again, but it doesn't have the unlimited appeal of today's modern-day strategy titles.   8.5  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Definitely. For those of you that played it the first time around, it's nice to see just how much of RTS gaming came from this one title. For everyone else, think of it as an interactive history lesson, that just might surprise you with its charm and substance. You may just find yourself setting down your current RTS faves to give this one some quality time.   YES!!!  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   9.5 For those of you that played it the first time around, it's nice to see just how much of RTS gaming came from this one title. For everyone else, think of it as an interactive history lesson, that just might surprise you with its charm and substance. You may just find yourself setting down your current RTS faves to give this one some quality time.", "date": "Jul 13, 2000"}
