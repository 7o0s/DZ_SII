What's that, you say, a puzzle game that is good and that I should buy? What? It's not the third in a series, it's not a franchise, it's not a bad remake of an action title from three years ago?   Yes, Devil Dice isn't the only puzzler game around this year. Roll Away, the sleepy, quiet little game that Psygnosis slipped into its enormous PlayStation lineup is the surprise hit of the year.  Very little explanation is needed for Roll Away. Or, at least it seems that way. You are a beachball (easy enough, right?) and your world consists of connected golden 3D blocks that hang loftily in space. Stretched out in front of your are items to collect, including fruit, coins, tablets (mother's little helpers), keys, and occasionally killer spikes that'll end it all for you on the spot. Your object is to collect all items available and find the exit to end the level. Your only real obstacles consist of a time limit and your mind.   In many ways the logic behind Roll Away is similar to that of Rubic's Cube. The 3D squares you can roll on in key joints enable you to switch to the bottom or side of that square, on which other items can be collected. Progressing through the game, you'll find that your ball can jump, and as the levels increase in size, the courses are split, and disjointed, and force you to figure out how to bridge the gaps. The trick is to start thinking in three dimensions, and to learn the ways in which you can move from ledge to ledge.                                                                                                                          The first 10 levels are easy to zip through, which is a smart move on Psygnosis' part. Despite their simplicity, you feel unabashed pride in your accomplishments, and then the game gradually becomes more difficult. But you're so confident, you won't know the depth of the madness until it's far too late. The next 20 levels will zip by relatively quickly, and you'll just want more. Like hot brownies, or freshly baked cookies, you'll just start in on them. And like any of the best puzzle games, you'll blow more hours than you had expected in the wink of an eye.  Roll Away is a large game, with as many as 200 levels, including bonus levels and other little oddities, and it will take up much of your time -- thankfully. Gamers won't have to start over again at the very beginning if they die, they can start again at that level's beginning and when you want to save a game, you can simply save right there and then. In turn, if you want to simply play without a time limit, you can turn that off, too.   Roll Away is a thinking person's game, and thus it's stark in the graphics department. It's about using your imagination. What you'll see is a beachball, backgrounds that appear to the sands of Egypt or a section of our solar system in the background, and a few other light, generic environments, and the paths on which you tread. Not surprisingly, the graphics are made up of cleanly programmed polygonal models, and special effects such as realtime lighting, lens flares, and repetitive texture maps are all included. It's tightly designed, and backed up with a surrealistic set of moody atmospheric soundtracks that would be great in the designated chill room at a Rave or club.   Roll Away supports force feedback, which occurs very seldom: When hitting a spike, or jumping from path to path. It's a nice touch that adds a little energy and breaks up the tense moments quite well. The game doesn't support analog control. Roll Away is a one- to two-player game that is made up of an arcade mode and a time trial mode.  Puzzle fans will flip over this gem, and what's nice is the smooth learning curve that should have casual gamers falling over themselves to play it. I have very few complaints. The only thing to ask for is a greater variety of backgrounds and textures to break up the occasional monotony of same colored blocks. Other than that little complaint, Roll Away is an extremely attractive game that's intelligently conceived and executed.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Dec 10, 1998"}
