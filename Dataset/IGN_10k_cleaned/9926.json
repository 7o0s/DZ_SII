When launching this Retro channel, I wanted to spend a little time highlighting these personal favorites so you could get an idea of what kinds of games really left a lasting impression on me. Yes, I'm on board with the usual suspects like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, but there are other key titles that have shaped my appreciation for the art. Alex Kidd in Miracle World for the Sega Master System is one of them. The classic Activision shooter Dreadnaught Factor nailed home the power of an emotional narrative. In the case of that game, that emotion is right in the title: Dread. Skullmonkeys for the PSone underlines how personal vision and true craftsmanship can overcome the confines of a genre.   Mountain King, a game I originally played on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Colecovision is another title that remains near. The mechanics of this adventure game are simple -- gather up enough gems to open a hidden door and then escort a prize to an exit -- but developer E. F. Dreyer understood something that far too many videogames to this day still unfortunately overlook: The weight of a striking soundtrack. Spartan visuals abdicated space for a pair of melodies that lift the game up and marry it with real drama.   The two songs are culled from classical music -- ~Anitras' Danse~ and ~In the Hall of the Mountain King~ by Edvard Grieg. The game starts out absolutely silent, which makes the later appearance of the music all the more effective. Your hero starts on the outer slope of a multi-tiered mountain. Bats occasionally flutter through the night. A lonely flame flickers at the summit -- the Perpetual Flame. You must find the flame spirit that matches the summit fire into order to gain passage to a hidden chamber at the heart of the mountain. However, the flame spirit is invisible to the naked eye. In order to force the spirit to reveal itself, you must collect 1,000 points by gathering up the gems that sparkle along the tiers. Once you have the necessary points, the flame spirit can be located.   Spotting the flame spirit in the 5200 edition of Mountain King.   That spirit, though, only flashes briefly. So in order to spot it, you must explore the caverns with your flashlight in hopes of catching sight of the dancing silhouette. Fortunately, the flame spirit does offer an audio clue. As you close in on the spirit, you hear a faint beep-boop rendition of ~Anitras' Danse.~ It grows louder as you close in on the flame spirit, playing full bore once you've reached its hiding spot. Now, bow before the flame spirit and claim its power.   Once you have the flame spirit, you can now enter the secret alcove at the bottom of the mountain. The flashlight reveals a skull spirit standing watch over the portal. Bow before it, surrounded by the aura of the flame spirit, and it will relent. Once inside, you glimpse a glowing gilded crown. This is the prize of the Mountain King, but it will only be yours if you take it to the fire at the top of the crag.   As soon as you exit the chamber with the crown, the bats become more aggressive. They scream down the caverns trying to intercept you and snatch the crown. If a bat touches you, the crown is restored to the hidden chamber and you must collect another 1,000 points to relocate the flame spirit. But it's not only the bats that make the journey to the surface harrowing. The music is chilling. ~In the Hall of the Mountain King~ is the perfect accompaniment to this desperate climb. The coldness of the composition, synthesized through the Atari's limited audio capabilities, registers real panic. If you do not make it to the surface before the music runs out, the crown is also lost. So, with that haunting melody breathing down your neck like one of those determined bats, you must jump and climb up the ledges and ladders.   Let me tell you, those bats love to make a last-second grab just as the summit flame is in sight.   Nabbing the crown is only half of the game.   As described, Mountain King doesn't necessarily sound like a deep game, but understand that this was no cakewalk. Not only did you have the bats to worry about and a soundtrack to freak you out, but you also had a time limit to contend with. Every crown you win, the time limit grows shorter. Plus, there is not an unlimited supply of gems in each mountain. If you fail in your task enough that there are less than 1,000 points worth of gems remaining, you have no choice but to reset the game. And just for good measure, there is a hungry spider that scurries along the bottom of the mountain that will trap you in its web if you spend too much time in the basement.   Mountain King's difficulty was also augmented by its jumping system. Timing the jumps was tricky, thanks to the decision to assign jumping to pressing the joystick diagonally. (The analog Atari 5200 stick made this a real treat.) But if you lined up a jump, you could easily escape a bat. I remember spending a significant amount of time coordinating jumps that sent me flying through the air, off the summit or down a stretch of gaps in the tiers just for fun.   Mountain King on the Colecovision.   Mountain King was an incredible game in 1983 -- and it's still a potent classic. I was primarily affected by the way the music really charged the game with a sense of urgency and dread. ~In the Hall of the Mountain King~ remains one of my favorite compositions to this day, thanks in no small part to this game. (Listen to it played on a pipe organ for maximum effect.) The game mechanics themselves are fairly simplistic, but made engrossing just because one key design choice: Music. It's a lesson that every game maker today must recognize. And the best games often do.", "date": "Jan 31, 2008"}
