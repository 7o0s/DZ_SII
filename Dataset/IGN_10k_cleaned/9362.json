Stretching out on the beach, basking in the sun, and breathing deep the fresh, unspoiled air of the sea  because Petz Wild Animals: Dolphinz, at long last, is a breath of fresh air for the virtual pet category of the DS library. This is a game that does something different. It establishes its own identity, focuses its gameplay on a set of animals previously untapped by other titles, and offers players a vibrant, engaging world that's full of color, and colorful humor. Don't be turned away by the ~Z~ letter branding that Ubisoft's placed on the package  Petz Wild Animals: Dolphinz is a winner, and shouldn't be negatively associated with any of the lesser games that have held the Petz name in the past.   The branding is a latecoming addition, actually, as this title was originally developed by Magic Pockets and presented as Dolphin Island, a standalone experience not meant to be a part of any larger animal series. And the ~Island~ in that original name refers to the game's setting, a tropical paradise that's home to a marine creature amusement park currently under construction, and the place where main characters Greg and Mila get unceremoniously dumped by their parents for the summer. The two kids don't take too kindly to being abandoned to the care of their kooky Uncle Bob, owner of the park, for the duration of two months  but they soon come to appreciate the animals there and enjoy taking care of them.   You choose to play as either Mila or Greg, and enter into the world of caring for sea creatures, maintaining the park's cleanliness and training animals for performance events one step at a time. The game unfolds day by day, with each new dawn bringing with it new styles of gameplay and new responsibilities  though you start off slowly, with just one dolphin and one killer whale comprising the park's entire collection of species, you quickly expand the attractions by building new pools and rescuing new endangered animals from the wild. You end up with a diverse assortment  sea turtles and giant manta rays, hammerhead sharks and emperor penguins. There are even some big-beaked pelicans that show up after a while.   Wait, sharks aren't dolphins...  It's refreshing to have such a wide array of different animals to interact with, after so many other games in the virtual pet genre focus exclusively on just one species, or a handful of breeds of the same species. It breaks up the monotony of regular gameplay activities like feeding and cleaning when you can focus your efforts on alternate animals from time to time.    Those activities, expectedly, involve the touch screen  as feeding is accomplished by remembering the right order of nine different types of seafood to serve to your park's animals, dragging and dropping them into a feed bucket with strokes of the stylus, and cleaning is achieved by similarly touching and ~pulling~ pieces of floating debris into a big net placed in the water.    These early bits of gameplay aren't too deep or all that inventive, but things get going later as you progress through the story  you end up learning how to train dolphins for Sea World-esque performance shows, and the interface for those is most reminiscent of the excellent Elite Beat Agents. You'll tap and drag along paths to register ~hand gestures~ for your performing porpoises, who'll interpret the signs and leap together, in unison, out of the water and into the air. It's not hard, at first, but things definitely pick up in pace and complexity later in the adventure, and the game can offer a fair amount of challenge then.   The most engaging thing about Petz Wild Animals: Dolphinz, though, is its story and characters. The game has a great cast of cartoon personalities, all of whom interact together beautifully and who offer up some great, over-the-top, comedic dialogue. Almost all other virtual pet games dismiss the possibility of having a plot entirely, making you the nameless, faceless ~owner~ and putting the focus solely on the animals. But here, you've got Waldo the eccentric dolphin trainer; Coddy the tight-laced, military-esque environmentalist; Gloria, the no-nonsense personal assistant and more. There are even secret agents who appear to grade your work in keeping up the park, and sinister tycoons who show up to try to drive the island into bankruptcy  it's a hilarious revolving door of well-designed supporting characters, and their hand-drawn, cartoon appearance always looks great.   If there's a negative to be leveled against Dolphinz, it would have to be in its responsiveness to touch screen input. It's not bad, or distracting in any real way. But it isn't 100% accurate all the time, and you'll notice that navigating around the island environment by ~pulling~ the camera's focus doesn't always flow as smoothly as it should, and some of the quick-strike presses on the screen during faster-paced mini-games might not register right. It's a rare event, but you'll replay some of the mini-games so often that you're bound to notice it eventually.Petz Wild Animals: Dolphinz should be a sigh of relief for virtual pet fans, who've had to endure two years worth' of Nintendogs clones and horse training sims, most of which have been nothing but a pain to play. But this game is different  which different animals, and different activities, and an actual, engaging storyline filled with fun characters that make you want to keep on playing long past the time when you promised yourself you'd stop. It's a very good option for fans of the digital animal category of gaming, and is also especially notable in that it offers an experience that most kids wouldn't otherwise get to have, growing up. Lots of children get to have dogs or cats as pets in their homes, but how many get to own dolphins, sharks and killer whales? Don't be put off by the Petz name, if that branding seeks to give you pause  instead, give this adventure a chance. It really is a breath of fresh air.", "date": "Oct 30, 2007"}
