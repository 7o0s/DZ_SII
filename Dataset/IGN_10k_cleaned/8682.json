It's full of glitzy settings, personable characters, and gambling -- three great ingredients for a memorable little casino romp. But rather than just dump these cooler-than-thou thieves into a straight casino game, developer Universomo has assembled an interesting story-driven gambling sim that changes players with using the entire team to build up a healthy bankroll before they can bring down Willy Bank, the nefarious casino overlord that wronged Danny Ocean's friend Reuben.   Interesting, however, does not equal entertaining. And while the effort by Universomo to craft something different is to be commended, the game falters under a number of problems, from the art direction to the gambling mini-games. As the start of the game, you only control Danny Ocean. You must bring together the team one by one through exploring a series of fictional Las Vegas casinos. Each team member has a gambling specialty needed for bumping your bottom line, but in order to get into many of the casinos, you must pay a hefty door charge to smooth over past sins.   You have 21 one days to get everything together and bring down Willy Bank's casino, known as The Bank. So, with each day, you must win enough cash to unlock a new casino. Mingle in that casino to find your next teammate and learn information, install found members at other casinos, and play a series of casino games. You can occasionally run into ~accidental~ cash windfalls at casinos, too, so make sure you do plenty of talking.   The idea of building the team and earning cash is actually pretty good, but the game doesn't really deliver on making the different characters feel remotely close to their movie counterparts. Much of the movie's charm is propped up by clever dialogue and winking nods, but this isn't conveyed in the mobile game. The character sprites also dampen any hope for personality. Obviously, the actor likenesses were not secured for the game, and that's not necessarily a problem, but every character looks almost the same. They all have the same jutting jaw line, the same stature, the same facial structure, and even similar hair. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you know full well that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Carl Reiner do not look the same. Carl Reiner is way more handsome than those other shlubs.   The gambling is passable at best. You can play roulette, craps, and blackjack; all of them function on a technical level. The gimmick in Ocean's 13 is that you can cheat during each game and tip the odds in your favor. By pressing 1, 2, or 3 during a hand, spin, or throw you can hopefully affect your odds. You must watch the dealer's eyes, though, making sure he's looking away. And you also need to watch your own cool, which is measured by a meter on the left side of the screen and beads of sweat coming from your forehead. If you cheat while the dealer is looking or you cheat so poorly that you lose anyway, you risk getting caught and expelled from the casino, losing your chips. The cheating mechanism isn't much fun and seems to do little to really help your luck, especially at roulette.   Between the lack of personality and the so-so gambling, Ocean's 13 spirals downward pretty fast. At least the music is good. I never found myself reaching for the mute.  It's never fun to give a negative review to a game that is obviously trying to do something different, but Ocean's 13 simply isn't much fun. The gambling sequences are boring, the plot is thin, and the art direction is iffy. You're better off saving your six bucks for that next trip to Vegas.", "date": "Jun 25, 2007"}
