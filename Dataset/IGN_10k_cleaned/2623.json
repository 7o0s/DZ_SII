Originally introduced to US and European players as Kid Yin in Legend of the Mystical Ninja on the SNES, Goemon finally appeared under his real name in the N64 3D adventure, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon. But whereas the SNES saw four outstanding Goemon games (three platformers and one Zelda-inspired adventure), more recent Goemon games have failed to recapture the magic of the 2D classics that date back all the way to 1986. Sadly, even though the new Goemon: New Age Shutsudo (roughly translated as ~Storming Into a New Age~) for Boy Advance revisits the 2D realm, it doesn't manage to break that trend.Not content with continuing Goemon's ~super-deformed~ adventures in a pseudo-ancient Japan populated with mechanical dolls and traditional fantasy creatures, Konami has decided to give Goemon a makeover. Goemon is no longer short and squat, he's now tall and ~cool.~ He no longer lives in the past, but rather in the Japan of the future. His sidekick is no longer a bumbling idiot named Ebisumaru, but rather a cute little girl named Ebisu. I can't help but think of the movie The Player -- Goemon got hollywoodized. The whimsical warrior wannabe of old is gone, replaced with a hip platform superstar. Sadly, the redesign has turned Goemon into a much more generic character. This wouldn't be such a big problem if at least the gameplay would be original, but unlike most of its predecessors, Goemon Advance lacks inspiration and doesn't really do anything new or better. As a matter of fact, the core portion of the game plays like every platformer from the early '90s. It's a good thing that Konami added some extra bells and whistles to make Goemon Advance a bit more than just an average game.In case you never played the SNES Goemon games, Goemon and his friends explored castles, graveyards, volcanoes, and even ski resorts scattered across ancient Japan, all brought to life with plenty of parallax scrolling and impressive Mode 7 rotation effects. You could run, jump, crawl, and hit opponents with your character's weapon of choice (both close-up and projectiles). In between the levels, you could explore towns, buy items, and partake in fun mini-games, including a limited version of Gradius, Mario Kart style Mode 7 racing, and even two-player air hockey. Speaking of which, one of the staple elements of the Goemon series was a two-player co-op mode. Players could work together to beat up opponents and even carry each other piggyback to get past tough platform jumping levels. Later Goemon games (starting with #2 on the SNES) also added 3D mech-fighting to the fray. Using simple leftright punch combinations, you would square off against a monster or mech enemy and engage in fun first-person combat.Goemon Advance duplicates gameplay elements from all its predecessors, but without the clever level design, the mini-games, or the multiplayer options. The mech fighting is still there, you still visit towns, explore underwater levels, and the backgrounds are nicely drawn, but everything else is such standard stuff, you'll keep on muttering ~deja vu~ to yourself as you play. The old Goemon games had varied opponents with different strategies, plenty of secret areas, and even vehicles to use in the side-scrolling sections. The new game's levels are made up of platform after platform populated by enemies that all fight the same way. There's very little strategy involved here. Jump, slash, jump, slash. The enemies don't really get more intelligent either. Instead, the gameplay is simply made more difficult by adding more bottomless pits. For example, one level has you climb up Tokyo Tower -- or rather, collapsing platforms that hover in the air in front of Tokyo Tower. One wrong step and you'll have to work your way all the way up again. To its credit, though, the pseudo-3D boxing matches remain a fun distraction and there are some nice little touches (like a sidescrolling shooting level starring everyone's favorite mechanical ninja, Sasuke).Graphically, Goemon's modern environments don't look as nice as the landscapes of the old games. It's a matter of style for the most part, but the graphical effects are less flashy as well. On the upside, Konami really knows how to use rotational effects in 2D games. Like the older Goemon games, the GBA sequel uses the system's rotational capabilities for player characters in the shooting or underwater portions, for 3D effects in the mech battles, and even for gameplay purposes in ~kaiten stages~ that rotate around the player. In the end, though, the old games' graphic design is still more interesting to look at. Haunted graveyards and ancient Shinto shrines just translate into more interesting visuals than steel buildings and futuristic cityscapes. Audio-wise, Konami serves up technically well-produced, but ultimately forgettable tunes. Think '80s rock played by a GBA and you get the idea. Certain themes are carried over from the old Goemon games, but the compositions aren't anywhere near as good. The sound effects are vintage Goemon stuff, but Konami could have gone easy on the ~yah!~ samples. Every time you hit something or jump, Goemon and his friends feel compelled to yell ~yah.~ Since there's quite a lot of hitting and jumping, get used to hearing it a lot...The game comes complete with battery back-up and even an ~interrupt save~ function that lets you save at any point in the game. In case you're interested in importing the game, note that most of Goemon: New Age Shutsudo can be played without knowing Japanese. However, buying items in stores and getting hints from ~villagers~ is a bit more complicated if you can't read basic kana.Goemon's GBA debut starts off slow, but gets better as you delve deeper into the game. Sadly, you can never quite shake the feeling that you've seen everything before -- but with more interesting characters and more original level design. As a part of the Goemon franchise, New Age is a bit of a disappointment. It's a competent sidescroller that shows glimpses of Konami's past genius here and there, but never comes close to the quality of the old SNES sidescrollers. I hope that after this brief trip into the future, Konami brings the Goemon franchise back to its roots or even re-releases the much more charming SNES Goemon games on GBA -- complete with 2-player link-up gameplay, of course.", "date": "Apr 18, 2002"}
