Built on the foundation of 2006's mediocre Glory of the Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum feels even more dated now despite the noticeable improvements in graphics. As good as it looks though, the city management gameplay lacks style and the combat portions are woefully underdeveloped.  There's not an official campaign here per se. Instead, you're given a number of different scenarios to play through. Some take you through a timeline of Rome and allied cities, letting you try your hand at building the Eternal City from it's earliest days, or reliving the heyday of Pompeiian life under the shadow of a smoldering Vesuvius. There are some neat choices here, and some nice nods to Roman history but the overall effect is pretty generic. We did like the inclusion of the big Roman monuments like the Circus Maximus and the Colloseum, but the short historical notes that go along with them are too brief to give people who aren't already Roman history fans a sense of what they were all about.   All the usual suspects of the city-building design are present here. Players have to place houses to attract workers, and then build city services like wells, schools and temples to keep the people happy. In order to help your people prosper and elevate them to a higher tax bracket, you'll also need to provide them with clothes, wine, baths and a host of other amenities. But in order to get access to clothes and wine, you'll need to create farms to produce the raw materials and workshops to process them into finished goods. Of course, these farms and workshops need employees who will be drawn from your houses. The whole appeal of the design is the unique balancing act required to keep all the aspects of your city up and running with as little waste as possible.  There's something undeniably satisfying about designing your own fully functioning city and it's an activity that we truly relish, particularly when the interface makes building placement is as easy as it is here. The only real problem with Imperium Romanum is that there's nothing particularly evocative of the Roman setting and no real improvements or refinements in terms of gameplay. In short, this feels like Generic City Builder 101 with a light veneer of Roman civilization laid over the top of it.  And even that's hampered by the poor AI and general lack of information and control. The residents of the city sometimes seem completely unable to find essential services that you've located right next to their house, and riot-inducing unrest and cash-draining fires seem to spring up regardless of how wonderfully you're doing. While it's easy enough to see how herbalists and wells can help to stave off a plague, you're left completely on your own to figure out how to improve the economic outlook of your citizens and prevent them from turning to a life of crime.   Things are even more difficult due to the lack of helpful overlays. Sure, there are summary screens that show all sorts of numbers and figures for your production, consumption and population, but it's impossible to see in a glance, for instance, which houses have access to taverns, or which are covered by a prefecture. The Forum, which serves as your central structure throughout the game, provides the necessary information for your employment levels, and the buildings themselves will show when they've been deprived of a necessary resource like labor or upkeep, but you never really seem to get a look at the big picture that's required to keep all the parts of your civic body running smoothly.  The objectives are pretty standard for the genre. Some missions have you trying to acquire a set population, or reach a certain number of high-level houses, or complete large works projects. While it's nothing we haven't seen a million times before, the system is improved by the inclusion of individual objective cards that you can draw from a deck. Some objectives cards are just straight bonuses, like extra cash or resources. Others require you to complete certain structures to move on. Since you can draw up to three objective cards at a time, you can have a few different goals in front of you at once. Unfortunately, the card order is fixed for the scenario so you won't have as much variety when you go back and replay your favorite cities. We did like being surprised when we let our ~build barracks~ card sit open while we pursued other objectives, only to draw a card that called in a barbarian invasion that we were totally unprepared for.      Imperium Romanum offers very little in the way of exciting combat. Units are created at one of three different barrack types -- one each for infantry, archers, and cavalry -- and each barracks can only create one unit of that type. That means if you want to have three infantry, two archers and one cavalry, you'll need to create six different barracks, each of which requires their own attendant resource buildings. On some of the smaller maps, the space issue can really cripple your chances of making anything approaching an army that evokes the true character of the Empire.  Leading your units in battle is an exercise in simplicity in that you're given options to move, attack or retreat with a minor option for formations. Trying to come up with anything more sophisticated than a straight rush right at the enemy is nearly impossible. Making things worse still, you can't manually replace your losses. Instead, you have to actually send your units into certain death, and then wait for them to rout and run back to the barracks they're attached to. Only then will you be able to build them back up to strength. It would be funny if it wasn't so frustrating.   The truly hilarious thing is that it doesn't even matter. The barbarians are so passive, and the strength of your Roman walls and towers is so great, that you don't ever really need to even worry about creating armies. The only time you'll actually have to trot out the legions is when a barbarian camp just happens to sit on a resource that you have to acquire.  On the upside, the graphics here are better than they were in Glory of the Roman Empire. The environments are quite lovely, with all sorts of fine details, from the sunflowers in the field, to the smoke rising from the chimneys across your city. Your citizens are a bit blocky, but that won't be distracting at the level at which you're normally playing the game. Even in the extreme close-ups, it's nice to see a bit of life and personality among the inhabitants of the city. The little touches, like materials gathering near a construction site, or the dilapidated appearance of deserted buildings, adds even more visual appeal.  Though it may be more historically accurate, the sameness of the buildings tends to obscure strategic possibilities here. With time you can eventually learn to tell the different between the warehouses, baths and schools, but it's too hard to distinguish the buildings at a distance. While some gamers thumb their nose at the more stylized, colorful approach of Zeus, the exaggerated nature of that game's visuals made it much, much easier to tell your buildings apart, which gave players a greater strategic awareness than is possible in this game. Even if the gameplay issues are set aside, it still gets ridiculously tedious looking at a sea of red clay roof tiles.   There's lots of audio atmosphere all throughout the game, and it's well worth diving down to street level every now and then just to hear what's going on. It's hard to effectively play the game at this level, but the added sense of life that it brings is well worth it. On the downside, the soundtrack doesn't suit the mood of the game at all and tends to pull you out of the experience when it comes to the fore.  Finally, we (and some others we've talked with) seem to have had some problems with the game crashing. We can forgive a few crashes every now and then, but those in Imperium Romanum stand out for their frequency. It's likely that this issue will be worked out in a patch, but for now, it's still causing us frustrations.Enough already with uninspired city builders. We actually like the genre more than most, but it's not being advanced or even showcased in Imperium Romanum. Everything here has a very paint-by-numbers feel to it and, while we're not enemies of following the traditions and conventions of the genre, there's no reason to make yet another Roman-themed city builder if you're not going to try to do it in a way that is noticeably different from the other three that are still sitting on store shelves. Imperium Romanum might possibly be worth a look if you've never played one of these games before, but for the rest of us, it's an easy one to pass up.", "date": "Mar 24, 2008"}
