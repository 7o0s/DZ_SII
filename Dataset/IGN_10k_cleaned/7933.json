Games that have breathed life into the otherwise overloaded and frankly overplayed genre. Quake, Unreal and Half-Life are probably the games that best define this genre.  Each added its own twist to action gaming and showed that there were still mountains to be climbed and hoops to be jumped through.  Well, Requiem: Avenging Angel isn't going to break any molds, but it's not a bad shooter by any means.  It may not live up to its lofty intentions, but it's not going to be damned to hell, either.  For being a first person shooter, Requiem sure offers up one compelling story.  You are Malachi, an angel and one of the Lord's chosen who has been sent to the plane of creation to thwart the plan of a rival group of fallen angels.  These angels, lead by Lilith, wish to rid the earth of humankind for they fear that this unworthy race will soon discover the means of travelling to the heavens.  Lilith's minions have flooded the earth and are holding its inhabitants captive, inflicting strict curfews on the populace and torturing insurgents who aren't so willing to change.  As Malachi, you must travel to earth to avenge the travesty that these fallen angels have wrought and continue the work of Aaron, another avenging angel who was sent to earth before you.  Pretty heavy stuff, eh?  The game begins in an area called Chaos (what I call the 'Flesh Tubes'), inspired by Milton and depicted as a series of red tunnels in which are embedded the tortured corpses of the damned.  This is the plane between heaven and earth and a dimension controlled by Lilith.  While you are not invincible in this plane as you are in heaven, some of your angelic powers are still intact.  You can fly, shoot lightning and perform a few other divinities, but even in this area you're much weaker than your normal omnipotent self.  Of course, soon you'll leave the confines of Chaos and enter the plane of men.  When you hit the cold, hard streets you're left with little but the ability to shoot meager energy balls from your hands and light your way.  To survive the onslaught of the fallen angels and their followers you'll have to rely on more conventional means of warfare, and I must say that Cyclone Studios has provided Malachi with a nice assortment of weapons.  Throughout the game you'll progress from a wimpy pistol to heavier weaponry like a rocket launcher and mega-powered, hella-damaging railgun.   But, of course, the best feature in Requiem is the variety of divine powers that you'll acquire as you progress further into the game.  These include, but aren't limited to:   Bloodboil: causes your opponent's blood to boil and eventually explode.  One messy animation.  Brimstone: a fireball attack.  Deflect: turns enemies projectiles back unto them.  Flight: a high jump of sorts.  Not constant flight, but very helpful.  Haste: makes you move very fast.  Holy Light: lights you way in the darker parts of levels.  Lightning: um, you know, lightning.  Locust: a plague of locusts will attack your foes.  Pentecost: deadly energy spewed forth from your hands.  Shockwave: a mass damaging earthquake effect.  To Salt: turns your foes into a pillar of salt, which is promptly dispersed by the wind.  One of the neatest animations in the game.    Warp Time: slows down the action so you can effectively dodge easier and attack more.   OK, enough about the weapons.  You wanna know how Requiem plays, right?  Well, all of the action is fast and furious and there's nothing to complain about Requiem in terms of performance.  You'll be shooting it out with a variety of enemies, from human foot soldiers to demonic creations that would scare the poop out of Colin Powell.  It follows the mold of your typical shooter, but with a few adventure-style elements  la a little-known shooter from Rogue Entertainment called Strife.  Basically the adventure side of the game boils down to nothing more than listening to the story unfold from several of the NPCs in the game, but it does offer a nice break from the constant shooting action found in most other FPSers.  One thing that you'll notice is that the interface is confusing at first.  You can do a lot of different actions in Requiem and, with about twenty divine powers at your fingertips, there's quite a bit of tweaking you'll have to do before you're up and running efficiently.   Unfortunately, level design in Requiem can best be described as boring and uninspired.  It follows your same basic linear formula that most FPSers utilize and offers no challenge to find the end of the level if you have enough firepower and there are some levels where you do nothing but run straight through to the end with no altercations whatsoever.  On a high note, the levels themselves are fairly small and are logical extensions of the last level you cleared, making for fast load times and sensible navigation.  The AI in Requiem is nothing to write home about, either.  While your computer-controlled opponents will run away if they are horrendously damaged, Requiem still relies on horde AI mentality rather than cunning tactics and it in no way rivals Half-Life or Unreal in terms of AI acuity.  On the visual side of things, Requiem looks pretty good, but suffers in a few key places.  The lighting and particle effects from the divine powers are awe-inspiring and the To Salt animation where your opponents turn into salt and slowly dissipate is one of the neatest effects I've seen in a while.  But the gameworld is extremely blocky and everything is way too static and non-interactive to make you believe you're actually in a real environment.  For example, when the NPCs talk to you, their lips move but absolutely no attempt was made to synch their lips to what they're saying. Heck, one bum near the beginning of the game even continues to speak while he's taking a swig of ripple.  And he doesn't even spill a drop.      Multiplay in Requiem leaves a lot to be desired, and it looks as if the multiplay experience was secondary to the single player game. Like the single player game, the levels are bland and uninspired.  And there's absolutely no variety in gameplay ... it's deathmatch or nothing.  Adding to the poor multiplay options is a sparse number of player skins and that many of the divine powers are simply omitted from the multiplay experience.  Why oh why?   All said, Requiem is a fairly fun yet prosaic shooter that has some neat effects, but it's not destined to become a classic.  Those of you searching for a good multiplay experience should look elsewhere, but if you're into single player shooters then Requiem will offer up enough action to keep you busy for a while.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Apr 27, 1999"}
