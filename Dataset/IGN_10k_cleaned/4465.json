Put simply, Rainbow Six is one of the best games I've played this year, and ranks as one of the best games I've ever played in my life. In one fell swoop, Red Storm Software has gone from being a obscure developer to sitting on one of the biggest treasures the industry has managed to produce. While the game is not without its flaws, Rainbow Six entertains in a way no game has in very long time. Let's jump right in and take a look at why.  For those of you who haven't gotten a chance to play the demo, here are the basics of the single-player game. You are the leader of Rainbow Six, a super-secret organization put together by the U.N. to fight terrorism. Your team is made up of the best of the best from countries around the world. When someone starts trouble, and the political situation makes things to hot for local enforcement to handle, your team comes in and takes care of business.  The game itself is a first-person shooter with a real eye towards realism. Before each mission, you select which members of your team you're going to take with you into a fight, arm them with the appropriate real-world weaponry, divide them into teams, and then plot out on a map where each team is going to go, and what actions they're going to take. Once you leave the plotting stage, you choose which one of the squad leaders you'll play as and the mission begins. Each mission has its own objectives, but most of them revolve around rescuing hostages, stealing information, or other covert actions. Unlike most first-person shooters, Rainbow Six often rewards you for not killing opponents. Fortunately, there are plenty of situations where you'll have to.  In fact, there's several different ways in which Rainbow Six proves itself to be unlike any first-person shooter yet made. The most noticeable is the plotting stage I mentioned earlier. In this portion of the game, you can set waypoints and fairly complex objectives (disarm bomb, escort hostages, that sort of thing) for groups of men that are computer controlled. Unlike most games in which AI controlled characters are doomed from the start, Rainbow Six's soldiers are likely to be a lot better than you are at getting things done, at least in the beginning. They're fast, pretty good shots, and they're smart enough to take evasive action if things get hot.   Another great thing about the game is how differently you can approach each mission. There really is no right way to accomplish any mission. If you feel like there's going to be heavy armed resistance, and you're not worried about hostages, you can put together a team made up primarily of assault personnel armed to the teeth with M-16s and heavy body armor. If, on the other hand, you wish to enter a premises completely unnoticed, you'll want to use your recon troops, possibly backed up by a member of your electronics or demolition teams if there are any alarms or bombs to deal with. The important thing to remember is this  if you screw up at any time, the mission's probably over. The bad guys have absolutely no problem making good on their promise to kill hostages, and in Rainbow Six, no civilian loss is acceptable. Get a hostage killed (or kill them yourself), and you'll have to start all over again.  Although your team members are well trained, they're not superheroes. Unlike most first-person shooters, take a bullet in Rainbow Six and you're probably going to die. Even if you survive the wound at impact, you may still bleed to death over the next few minutes. Either way, you're not going to be much good to your team any more. This is one reason that missions tend to either be a complete success of complete failures. Once you men start getting hit, they're unable to fulfill the remainder of their duties, which can turn situation ugly fast. Body armor can help your men take more bullets, but the best defense in this game is truly a good offense. If you but a bullet in your enemy's head before he sees you, you don't need any armor at all.  Getting ready for a mission can be almost as fun as playing it out. With all of the real-world weaponry and high-tech equipment you can choose from, you'll feel a little bit like James Bond preparing for a direct frontal assault against the Russian army. Primary weapons range from the short range Benelli M1 Tactical 12-Gauge to the frighteningly accurate M-16A2. You'll also carry a secondary pistol to get you out of jams when they occur. Examples here include the familiar Beretta 9mm 92FS and the HK.40 USP. Although the supressed Beretta 9mm 92FS-SD is the most popular around the office, a few of PC Accelerator's team have been opting for the HK.45 MARK 23, arguing that once you're in enough trouble to need your sidearm, stopping power is much more important than stealth. Every weapon has a sighting mode that you can access during combat, some of which are capable of zooming in further than others (pistols for example, can only be sighted a few feet away where an M-16 can zoom in on an opponent's eyes across a battlefield). Other accessories you can send your team out with include extra ammunition for each of your weapons, flashbangs, explosive flares that can blind your enemies for a second or two, grenades, door charges that can be used to blow open locked doors if you're in a hurry, and special kits for disarming bombs and disabling alarm systems. One other accessory is the heart beat sensor, a high tech gadget that lets you detect the presence of nearby enemies even through walls. Although all of this equipment may sound confusing, it's all pretty intuitive, and it only takes a few minutes to sort out how all of it works.  Rainbow Six's missions follow a relatively simple storyline that I'm not going to outline here because it will ruin the game for you. They range from fairly short search and rescue operations towards the beginning of the game to really long missions at the end. In almost every mission, some sort of hostage is involved, so you can't just run down the halls laying into whoever you see. As stated earlier, almost every mission can be tackled from several different angles, but clever planners will almost always have the advantage over someone who haphazardly places men and equipment into the combat zone. Remember also that in this game bigger isn't always better. In some of the game's later espionage missions, you'll only want to bring in one team member, as each person who travels with you increases your chance of being spotted. Choose carefully though, while that assault captain may be better at fighting his way out of a tight situation, the recon soldier probably won't get into the situation in the first place.  Although Rainbow Six's single player missions are extremely entertaining, and definitely act as a good training ground, it's the game's multi-player support that makes it such a winner. For weeks now, the offices here have literally shut down as teams from IGN-PC, PC Gamer and PC Accelerator stop what they're doing to take each other on in a team deathmatch, or to cooperate on a difficult mission (and as much as I'd like to brag here, PC Gamer always beats the hell out of us). The intense adrenaline rush you get when you know someone's hunting you but you don't know where they are simply can't be described. This is a game that was built for friends to play together. In cooperative mode, a maximum of eight players each take on the role of one of the squad's soldiers and work together (hopefully) to solve one of the computer scenarios. The deathmatch is (obviously) where two teams (of up to eight players each)get together and try to kill everyone on the other side. Rainbow Six deathmatches are far quicker on average than those of other games for two reasons. First, it doesn't take everyone very long to die. If you get hit, it's usually over. Second, since man power is so important in this game, once your teammates start dropping, you're probably going to go pretty soon yourself. The game's dynamic and open nature also improves on this same sense of realism. Tricky ploys like setting door charges to blow up in an approaching teams face, or by raining grenades down onto an enemy position, are likely to work  but only once. You can always spot veteran players by the fact that they scan everywhere, constantly looking for a sign of anything that could be a trap.  Sadly, Rainbow Six does have a few problems. First off, its single player mode is far too short. Most of our office was able to beat the game in two days with time to spare. Second, there are a few clipping errors that cause trouble from time to time. In one level, the problem was so bad that I couldn't fit through a doorway at all, and had to look for another way to enter the building in question. AI problems with the soldiers or hostages that follow you can sometimes cause similar problems. More than once I had to shoot my own soldiers just to get them out of the way so that I could finish the mission. Still, as bad as all of this sounds, it doesn't really detract from gameplay that much at all. A patch is already available that handles some of these issues, and I assure you, even when the hang-ups are at their worst, you'll be having so much fun that you simply won't care.  So here's the verdict. I have never felt more secure about recommending a game than I do in recommending Rainbow Six. Its incredible gameplay, solid graphics, and fantastic multiplayer arenas are unlike anything you've played before. If you have a computer capable of running it properly, go buy this game. Believe me, you simply can't go wrong.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Sep 9, 1998"}
