For the PlayStation Portable release of the game, Coresoft went back and made a handful of improvements to the game's content as well as its AI system in order to provide a more challenging and rewarding experience.   Like its console counterpart however, it's not perfect. The main culprit here is the accelerated time that attempts to speed up the pace of the game. While this is fine in theory as all too many poker videogames can be slower-paced than we'd like, it messes with the strategy inherent to the game of poker. The amount by which time is accelerated seems to vary from game to game, but at its quickest you can go through a level of blinds in about two minutes. Playing in a super satellite game I timed how long it took me to advance through the levels, and after 16 minutes and 15 hands the blinds had raised from a starting $10/20 to a whopping $200/400. Being that each player began the tourney with $1,000, you need to be seriously aggressive and/or lucky very quickly in order to build up a stack large enough that the blinds don't begin to cripple you early on. It's not this bad in some of the later tournaments, but even still, there's no option to turn off the time acceleration and it really does change the way you need to play in a major way.    Aside from this, there's a lot to like about WPT on the PSP. For starters, Coresoft adjusted the already decent AI to make it a little tougher and plug some of the holes. It's more solid and less likely to make stupid moves than its PS2 counterpart, and yet still plays realistically. You can still push the AI off pots in situations that make sense, and they don't throw money around unless they actually have something going for them. It does still make the occasionally odd call, like one situation where the AI called my $330 all-in with a 3-5 off-suit (though it was loaded with chips), but these sorts of questionable plays aren't the norm.   The game's presentation aspects are a bit mixed. There are a series of training videos and player intros included with the game that are produced well enough and are interesting, but there are horrible compression artifacts everywhere. There simply doesn't seem to have been enough space on the UMD for all this video content.   On the other hand, there's a fair bit of interesting chatter to be heard amongst the players now. They'll talk to each other between decisions and try and rattle their play with phrases like, ~It's gonna get ugly!~ or ~Well I know what you look like when you're bluffin', and ~I know what you look like when you got it.~ For the most part, it's reasonably natural and actually sounds like stuff you'd hear while watching a WPT event.    The create-a-character options are equally as good as on the PS2, and the resulting characters look pretty great in practice. No poker game to date has really nailed realistic humans yet, but WPT is amongst the best-looking poker games. The animations are pretty good, celebrity characters are well-done and it generally is a nice looking experience. Again, poker games in general have a ways to go, but WPT is amongst the best in the genre.   One cool aspect, in theory at least, of WPT on the PSP is that you can play online versus players on the PS2. You don't get voice support, though PSP owners do gain the ability to use custom final tables, but otherwise they're identical. Once you're connected to a game it's smooth as silk. Play flows well, even a little better than against the AI since you don't have to wait for them to think, but that's when you're able to cleanly connect. We had issues sitting down at a few tables with errors ranging from ~This game is no longer joinable~ (even though other players were going in and out of the game) to NAT issues. Granted, once we got into a game it was great, but be aware that you may find connection issues here and there if you plan on playing online. And yes, this was with a boxed retail copy of the game.World Poker Tour on the PSP in many ways winds up being better than its PS2 counterpart. There are a couple new additions in terms of voice work and such, AI tweaks and so forth that help to make it an overall better experience, and it's great to be able to play against PS2 gamers online one second and then play against the AI the next while on the road. Its accelerated time structure hinders basic poker play styles and connecting to games has been a little shady, however. Still, it's a very solid poker experience that PSP poker fans should check out.", "date": "Apr 27, 2006"}
