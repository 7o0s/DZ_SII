I suppose it doesn't matter since Harlem Globetrotters World Tour combines both in what turns out to be an ugly, glitchy, basically unplayable knockoff of the classic NBA Jam design. The DS version is simply a two-screen edition of the absolutely atrocious Game Boy Advance version released last year, and other than the addition of two player support, there's nothing new. And nothing's improved.   Everything the Harlem Globetrotters are known for, from the light-hearted playfulness and goofy antics to their 'Sweet Georgia Brown' theme song is gone. As the instruction manual reads, ~the object of the game is to become champion of the World Tour by beating the best of the opposition in the world.~ Maybe I missed that when I was a kid, but I thought they were more about entertaining the audience and performing trick shots than aggressively climbing their way to the top of some fake leaderboards. This game is entirely humorless and aside from the barely noticeable backwards pass or punting of the ball, there is nothing Globetrotters about it.    The game is a barebones single-player 2-on-2 basketball game with 1 to 3-minute quarters. The player can select between two modes: Quick Match and World Tour. Quick Match allows the player to select their team, then throws them into a 4-quarter game against the opponent of their choice. In World Tour mode, for some reason the player isn't able to select their team or their opponent, but they get to pick their two playable characters from a wide selection of people who play exactly the same. Each characters has a range of statistics such as speed, offense, defense and stamina, none of which actually seems to have any impact gameplay.      And where are the Washington Generals? World Tour mode has the Globetrotters competing against fictional teams from around the world, but their hapless rivals of over 50 years are noticeably absent. The order in which teams are challenged in World Tour mode is randomized each time a new game is started. Because of this, difficulty never ramps up, and gets really old really fast.    Gameplay lands somewhere between awkward and awful. The player controls one of the two manually-selected players, and can swap between them at any time or pass the ball to do this automatically. Because of incredibly stupid AI (artificial intelligence) in both the teammate and the opponents, every character in the game seems preoccupied with running up to the playable character and humping his leg until the ball is stolen and they can make a dunk. All anyone does in this game is steal and shoot. The opponents don't seem to care if their ball stolen - once I stole the ball after setting my system down, and I'm not even sure how that's possible. By stealing the ball, walking around the mindless opponents, dunking and repeating, it's easy to blow through every game in the tour without any challenge. In my first game I beat my opponents 98 to 12. I know this is a kid's game, but that's just pathetic.    There are two pretty useless meters at the top of the screen. The first is a Stamina Bar, which displays how long the player is able to sprint using the L button. Don't worry about it though, as opponents walk so slow that sprinting is completely unnecessary. The second meter is a Special Bar, which fills with each successful shot or dunk and supposedly allows for the ~gravity defying dunks that have made the Harlem Globetrotters a household name.~ This would be nice if there was actually a button to pull off special dunks.    Buttons are so poorly assigned in this game, it's laughable. With the L button for the useless sprint and the R button for the even less useful 'basket targeting' (why do I need this when there's only one basket?), the developers miss a golden opportunity to reserve a few of these buttons for special moves or comedic antics, and actually come up with something that captures the spirit of the Globetrotters.    The camera gives a lot of grief as it follows the ball so tightly that it's impossible to keep track of the players. Massive character sprites take up so much screen space that the player has the option to either hang offscreen and guess where their characters are, or rush the opponent and have the ball passed right by them. Given the size of the players, the court itself looks about 30 feet long and the baskets about 8 feet tall. If a character botches a shot and it goes out of boundswell actually it can't, since there's an invisible collision at the edge of the court that always stops the ball - just like bumper bowling, and about as fun.    Graphically the game is awful, with ugly, mushy sprites that look like giant, identical Muppets. The crowd in the back has limited animation, and so do the playable characters who jitter and pop through most of their movement. The dunks and shots all look pretty much the same, and there's zero else going on in the court. No fanfare, no visual effects, nothing.    The audio in the game is barely audible. The classic Globetrotters theme is replaced with beat-driven drivel that sounds like a monkey banging on pots and pans. During gameplay all that's audible is the bouncing ball, squeaking sneakers and audience applause that's so unvaried it sounds like someone left a sink on.    The DS elements aren't worth writing about, and in fact, the addition of them make the GBA product worse. You literally have to take out the stylus to work your way through the clunky menu interface, but that's the only time the touchscreen's ever used. At least, thanks to Nintendo's enforcement of an EEPROM in every cartridge, the GBA's password system's out in favor of saving progress. That's about the only good thing we can say about this game.Harlem Globetrotters World Tour has very little to offer to anyone. It's a stupid, clumsy game that's not fun to play, easy to exploit and bears none of the humor and antics of the team it's based on. The menus and FMV intro are okay, but everything else is awful. Gamers looking for an arcade-style basketball game on the DS can do better, and fans of the Globetrotters will be confused and annoyed by the absence of everything memorable about the team. Anyone who gets this game as a gift will have more fun making a 3-pointer with it in the trash.", "date": "Mar 26, 2007"}
