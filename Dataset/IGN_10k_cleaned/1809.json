It only took them a decade to learn, but the same publisher who established movie licensed titles as a surefire corporate kiss of death has finally discovered that people want decent games.  First came TrickStyle, then Fur Fighters, and now Ducati World...it's almost enough to make even a veteran PC enthusiast believe there is a God.  Then again, perhaps this phenomenon has more to do with the company's newfound business associates than divine intervention (even if the latter scenario seems funnier from an editorial standpoint...stupid reality!). After all, how could you go wrong hiring Rollcage creators Attention to Detail to create an arcade racer that's essentially just a clone of their flagship product?  In plain English, Ducati World is just a stripped down, gutted, right side up, weapons-free version of Death Track Racing, aka Rollcage: Stage II.  One glance at the menu system, play mode architecture, and flamboyant action reveals that much.  Gone are futuristic, death on wheels vehicle models, replaced with realistic vintage and modern motorcycles.  But cosmetic changes can't hide the game's roots; this devil may care arcade racer treats bike physics so liberally that hogs might as well be supercharged monstrosities.  Still it's not like you'll really give a hoot, because this design convention guarantees a smooth, speedy race and balls to the wall action.  Just don't go in banking on a realistic simulation like Superbike 2001, understood? Don't make me come over there.  A surprisingly simple main menu belies the sheer quantity of options that huddle underneath.  Opting for a quick race is plain old insulting in this case. Ducati Life mode is where it's at; that's Acclaim speak for a career management, performance upgrade, and seasonal package rolled into one juicy, mouth-watering bite.  Within, players will find a complete range of motorbikes, helmets, leathers, and all sorts of other frivolous goodies up for grabs, provided they can meet the asking price.  Starting out with a measly 10,000 smackeroos, you must purchase an olden day or brand spanking new vehicle and race for more moolah, bigger machines, and improved parts.  And that's only the beginning.  You see, Ducati World can't necessarily be won.  The motivation for continued play depends entirely on drivers' hidden agendas.  Want to hold down top ranking in a league?  Or is it the thrill of money that excites?  Mayhap you just want every piece of Ducati memorabilia or every bike that's available?  Victory conditions have been left purposefully open-ended, so participants are basically just racing for the hell of it (that and cash).  Sure, challenge scenarios let ambitious helmet heads earn licenses, thereby opening more tracks, but that stuffy old standby is simply one of many alternatives you'll flip for. Amazingly, the unique career path setup works marvelously, and includes a staggering amount of game variants including personal challenges, multi-day races, miniature tournaments, and friendly exhibitions.  Trackside, this title holds up almost as well.  Bikes all handle differently and you can honestly feel the difference even tiny component modifications make.  Although play isn't encumbered by useless crap like real life scientific laws or an abundance of control keys, learning how to brake and lean into turns like an authentic driver is key.  Crashes either barely slow a man down or send him flying, rag doll style, seemingly at whim.  And naturally a little bump towards the median helps dedicated grease monkeys get ahead.  In essence, it's the best of both worlds, as you may note when screaming sideways up a wall thanks to a misjudged turn.  At odds with most vehicular pseudo-simulations, Ducati World pulls off the fence straddle technique quite nicely.  Such success is attributable to the AI.  While difficult adversaries, computer opponents possess a human side.  Though they have few qualms over whoopin' your ass by cruising on a pre-programmed path, these veritable androids also screw up realistically rather often.  It isn't uncommon for everyone's favorite little AI buddies to take a dive, temporarily wiping out most of the competition as they slide face down across any given roadway.  Nor do they hesitate to nudge your sorry butt off-course when necessary, causing even the hardiest driver to swerve like a frat boy after a kegger binge...or Tal that time after he got that bad batch of jalapeno poppers at the Navajo Code Talkers Memorial Burger King and Museum. For those who plan on hanging around long, two choices are therefore offered: improve your skills through mucho practice, or take a dot com's ridiculously irresponsible stance on business expenditures.  Ha ha.  It ain't all peaches and cream, though.  The repetitious nature of play hamstrings this remarkable racer.  Unless you own a bike that's excessively powerful compared with most other models in its current class, Ducati World becomes an endless loop of competition in which grease monkeys vie for loot, in order that upgrades may be had.  Why?  So the cycle can repeat itself, like in an RPG where characters bash green slimes for ten hours straight in hopes of gaining enough experience to take on a disgustingly powerful dragon. Or just more green slimes. Despite a promising foundation, the game's not buckwild like Road Rash, completely bonkers in Rollcage fashion, or streamlined a la Castrol Honda Superbike.  A more accurate comparison would be to call it an enhanced, much improved version of Sega's old Manx TT.  Troubles like this could have been avoided if the presentation had been improved before release.  As it stands, Acclaim's progeny features a look you likely haven't seen since the halcyon days of 3D acceleration.  Translation: it's outdated as galoshes.  While day, evening and nighttime scenarios look clean and bright, as do bike and character models, they're sterile as can be.  No background environment could be classified as having personality, though the blasphemous CGA sky textures may remind you of a toddler screaming ~nyaaah nyaah~ as they poo poo on an otherwise dandy party. Let them go poo on Dan instead. Although worse could have been anticipated from a PlayStation port, the game barely raises its head above the curve. Thank heaven they at least got some decent frame rates and special effects (skid marks, sparks, etc.) locked down.  Audio compositions aren't much better.  Basic engine noises and screeches accompany most of the action, with techno-esque European music audible only during menus.  A very bare bones approach was adopted in this regard, since most resources were funneled towards other departments.  Think of any generic arcade racer you've played in the last, oh, ten years, and you'll have an inkling of what awaits.  It'd be nice to hear more than just a vroom, vroom or metal grinding on concrete screech these days.  Nonetheless, Ducati World justifies its sensible $30 tag.  Look at it this way - you'll never run out of play options with the unlimited grab bag of pedal to the metal race variants available.  Alas, the sometimes tedious gameplay and boring visuals can prompt repeated sabbaticals, but hey, this is a conversion of a slightly above average console game; you get what you pay for.  With Redline Racer and Suzuki Alstare fast fading in the distance, this is your one chance this season to ride off into the sunset in style.  Be there or be square, monkey boy.  -- Scott ~Tushie~ Steinberg       Want to share your opinions with the world?
