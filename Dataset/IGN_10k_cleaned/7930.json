If you played and loved Sid Meier's Pirates, then you need to download this game.   Boasting historical accuracy, High Seas is set in 1695, the ~Golden Age of Piracy.~  You begin the game as captain of your own ship, sailing through tumultuous seas from port to port, seeking adventure and profit.  Choose your nationality from amongst the powers of Europe (each with varying difficulty levels and unique allegiances), or become a Pirate, knowing full well that every nation in the civilized world will want to see the waves run red with your blood.   You start with a modest but hearty ship called the Wormwood.  In each port you can visit the Trade Hall, where you buy and sell spices, food, and other goods (the values will increase or decrease, depending on the market in that particular port).  Swing past the local tavern to get mission assignments or buy a round of drinks for gossip and advice.  Then head to the Shipyard for repairs, upgrades to your ship and crew, more ammunition, or to trade your ship in for a better, more expensive one.  (You can christen each ship with a name of your choosing -- but please, for the love of God, don't call yours the Black Pearl.)   In capital cities you can visit the governor, whose response to you will depend upon your allegiances and the reputation you've developed.  The better your reputation, the more likely a governor will give you special (potentially lucrative) missions.  If, however, you've blasted your way into disdain with every single nation, you can always try to buy his good graces by making a generous donation.   If things seem a bit complex, never fear -- you can always hit 0 and Raja, the friendly talking parrot, will pop up with tips and easy explanations.   Choose your destination on the map screen, scrolling through 26 ports for a random destination, or press 7 to jump directly to mission locations.  Once you decide where you're headed, the real fun begins: climb aboard your ship and set sail.   For the most part, the journey consists of watching your tiny ship icon glide along a dotted line.  Inevitably, you'll come into contact with another ship of assorted size and nationality.  In some cases you can speed right past; in others you have no choice but to fight to survive; and in many (well, let's be honest -- most) cases you'll want to engage in ship-to-ship combat.   While the intrigue is fun and adds multiple levels of enjoyment, High Seas really deserves kudos for its clever combat system.  You and your enemy appear side-by-side in split screens, with a meter at the bottom indicating the distance between ships.  Select from three shot types, adjust your aim to vary the arc of your shot, and fire when ready.  The Round Shot will be your most frequent choice, as it's unlimited and effectively pounds the enemy.  The short-ranged Grape Shot takes out the crew, while the Chain Shot rips into your opponent's sails; you can purchase quantities of both at Shipyards, so keep a close eye on how much you've got left.   Ships vary in crew size, defense, and weapon strength.  While most skirmishes are likely to end in your favor, be wary of ships that outclass you, especially in outlying regions and on the open sea.  While fleeing may be an option if you find yourself in an impossible situation, expect to take heavy damage anytime you turn and run. If the tide of war turns in your favor, you can choose to sink or board your opponent, which involves bringing your ship alongside the enemy's and typing in a series of numbers as they appear onscreen.   It seems intricate, and the first few skirmishes aren't likely to end in your favor, but with a little practice, you'll figure it out and even look forward to each new battle.   High Seas is a first-rate pirate simulation.  It would be an overstatement to suggest you can actually taste the salty ocean air, but the game is nonetheless impressively multilayered, especially for a mobile game, and offers an immersive experience.  By the time I'd sold the Wormwood and purchased a larger, faster ship, I was completely hooked.   Unfortunately, the limitations of a mobile game eventually bring a sense of dj vu.  After a few hours, the combat system can become tiresome, as each battle eats up another two to three minutes of your life, with only minor variations.  What's more, there may come a point where you find your ship ridiculously outclassed by seemingly unbeatable opponents.  I give High Seas points for letting you restart at your previous port of call rather than forcing you to rebuild from scratch, but getting trounced time and again in the more dangerous seas may cause undue frustration, especially when you're trying to complete a mission in a given time limit.   These quibbles aside, High Seas is loaded with sharp graphics and engrossing features, making for a surprisingly riveting gaming experience right on your phone.   High Seas is refreshingly unique, distinctive, and above all, fun.  The game play starts out a little complex, especially for a mobile game, but you'll find yourself very quickly getting the hang of things and looking forward to each new mission.  So put away your rum, me hearty, and set sail for a voyage of boundless adventure.", "date": "Jan 18, 2007"}
