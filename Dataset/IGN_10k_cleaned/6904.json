Predator 3D is probably as close as we're gonna get for some time. AVP3D is an on-rail arcade-style shooter that sends players on a tour through the arctic pyramid set pieces that provided a playground for the warring alien and predator tribes.   As an on-rails shooter, AVP3D is a mild success. The level design is pretty good, with plenty of blocks, crates, and rocks to move between, offering up opportunities to blast face-huggers, alien soldiers, and the occasional penguin. The game begins in the whaling station, and a leisurely-paced tutorial lets you practice with a few game mechanics, such as the snap-to targeting, which is a major saving grace. When you move the cursor close to an enemy, the reticle automatically ~snaps on~ to the target so you can fire with assurance and authority. This system works exceptionally well for a mobile game, since the platform doesn't have a sterling rep for offering surgical controls.   While moving through the levels, you encounter medicine balls that up your health, as well as extra ammunition and shield icons that boost your chances of survival. There are also environmental targest, such as exploding barrels and stalactites that injure nearby monsters or clear routes through the play areas.   As you play, AVP3D ramps up the difficulty is a very enjoyable manner. The whaling station is extremely easy, all the better for gathering your bearings -- and learning how to shake off face huggers that show you their womanly side closer than you'd ever want. However, by the third level, when you are facing off with predators that use camo to hide between temple pillars, you'll find yourself occasionally dying and having to restart. The secret is preserving ammo for the good weapons, such as the M35, and clicking # to bring up your boring old pistol when dealing with base-level baddies like face huggers or triggering environmental targets.   My big complaint with AVP3D is the level size: They're too long for mobile. Instead of having five tracks that last a few minutes each, I'd prefer to have seen ten one- or two-minute shooting galleries that make for easier bite-sized play. And then offering hidden power-ups or goodies that made you want to replay. Imagine seeing a barrel very, very quickly in one shootout, and having to make the choice between blasting an incoming predator or the barrel, which would unlock, say, a wallpaper.   The 3D is AVP3D in handled pretty well. There are a few clipping issues, but I was extremely happy to see zero slowdown. I tested the game on a big-screen (relatively) LG VX8000 and could really appreciate the smoothness of travel through the level and size of the enemy models and their decent detail. The presentation is also solid, with menus that look like computer screens from Weyland Enterprises, and the very cool loading screen effect that fills of a glowing glyph.  AVP3D is a decent enough shooter that fans will want to play through at least once -- so definitely buy it on subscription if it's available as such on your carrier. I didnt want the size of the game to necessarily be smaller, but the levels need to be shorter and more plentiful. Dying at the end of a particularly lengthy level (by mobile standards) is frustrating. The graphics are pretty good and the animation is very smooth. However, it's a game you'll be done with in a day or two, maybe even pass it over to a friend, so if the dollar-playtime ratio is of particular importance to you, take that into consideration. Personally, I found more value in Superscape's Scuba Solitaire, but there's no alien-shooting in that one, so if you're an action fan, AVP3D is the better bet.", "date": "May 23, 2006"}
