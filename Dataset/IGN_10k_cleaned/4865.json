Ugh. After that game kicked sand in our teeth, Mforma dropped a line to see if it could help us erase that bad business with their own little volleyball game, the ambitiously titled Ultimate Beach Volleyball.   Features:   Nine bikini-clad players  Five beaches  Multiple moves   Well, we're not sure if it's the ~ultimate,~ but Ultimate Beach Volleyball is certainly a gigantic step above that previously mentioned atrocity. The game is an improvement in every category, from looks to moves, and while it's not the best game we've ever played on a handset -- it's still a pretty decent download for a sports fan.   The game sports nine bikini-clad beauties that are ready to hit the beach and show off their moves. They're aren't nearly as detailed as the ladies of Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, but that might be okay. It was kinda scary how much some dudes got into that game and those girls.   Once you select your team, it's time to hit the sand. The game offers multiple moves, not just bump, set, and spike. You can dig in, saving the ball but landing flat on your pretty little face. You can put spin on shots. You can jump up and block a ball from various hot zones on the court.   Ultimate Beach Volleyball has two play modes: VS and Tournament. The simple VS mode just opens into a quick play match, good for beginners that need to get their bearings on the game's controls. Tournament play  allows you to enter a round-robin tourney, entering matches to win cups, trade characters to other teams, etc. Its not ~dynasty mode~ deep, but it gives the game some longevity.   One cool little feature: Between rounds, you can visit a cafeteria and order up food. But you need to be careful what you put on your plate, as some food doesn't agree with your players' tummies. If you buy bad food, their energy drops. Alternatively, if you pick something that suits the palette, you have a good chance of having a great game next time you hit the beach.  Ultimate Beach Volleyball looks pretty solid. The game comes out of Korea, so it bears a very similar look to other sports games (golf, tennis) we've seen come out of the region. Big eyes, high cheekbones. Anime, but not quite anime.  Ultimate Beach Volleyball is a decent little volleyball game for fans of the genre. I'm certainly grateful that Mforma helped healed the psychic wounds left over from Baywatch. If you're a fan of the sport, or other sports games like golf and tennis, give the game a try.", "date": "Jul 29, 2004"}
