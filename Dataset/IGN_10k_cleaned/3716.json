At least, we thought we downloaded a traditional puzzler... what we ended up with for our few bucks was a bizarro thinker that pitted us against a fat stack of falling sushi.  Was it a pleasant surprise, or is this puzzler four-day-old fish that ain't worth buying?  Features: Crazy sushi match-up!  You do it! Super selection of sushi!  Make it right! Progress saved good!  A-OK!  Squareville Wasabi?  How can you not want to download something titled that? After paying our admission price and waiting for the download to complete, we fired up this goofball puzzler. And after a few minutes, we discovered that curiosity is sometimes rewarded with more than a Vanilla Coke and a slumming Italian-American actor.  Because what we found ourselves playing was a goofball-themed classic puzzler that had us hooked from the get-go.  It's you versus a mountain of raw fish and rice. To clear the board, you must start lining up sushi and sashimi of like kinds. Ebi goes with ebi. Nigiri goes with nigiri.  (And California rolls go in the trash--end of commentary.)  Line up four, and you're rewarded with a medal. Get enough of these super sushi medals, and you move up in the sushi chef world.  The well of sushi is four spaces wide. The column of sushi takes up the middle two spaces, leaving open spaces to maneuver the sushi piles on the sides. Move the indicator up and down the column and slide pairs of sushi horizontally to make fishy foursomes. And if you manage to manipulate the columns just right, you can sometimes make a match in the everlasting stash of sushi that keep tumbling down the middle.  Because there is so little to the actual game, we didn't expect much from Squareville Wasabi's visuals. Hey, the sushi look like sushi, so what more can you ask for?  And we've been to our fair share of sushi joints, and they were all infinitely noisier than this place. Where's the hustle and bustle? Where's the fun music, or comments from the master chef? Squareville Wasabi is just a goofy, guilty pleasure of a puzzler than manages to quickly win me over, much in the way that Charisma Lee did a few weeks back. Of course, it certainly helps that at the heart of Wasabi is a very competent puzzle game that manages to yank you in before you know what's happened. It's the most fun I've had with sushi since Terry Bradshaw personified the ~ugly American~ in his sushi-themed 800-COLLECT commercial. ~You forgot to cook this?~ Oh, Terry.
