Just when everyone thought that Nintendo would continue to put out updates/sequels of each and every SNES game ever made (Mario Kart, Pilotwings, Star Fox, Zelda), in comes Rare's Blast Corps with totally unique gameplay, great sound and graphics. In a way, Blast Corps is almost like a nostalgic trip back to the heydays of the NES or the time of Robotron and Missile Command (although the game itself is much more complex). But unlike many games that ~pretend~ to be a movie with ultra-realistic lense flare or a cartoon with stubby characters and funny antics, Blast Corps never denies that it is primarily a video game, and that is very refreshing...The background story is simple: A nuclear missile carrier is leaking and automatically locks on target -- which means: it's rolling relentlessly and blows up the world if it hits anything. But the story really is only an excuse for smashing eight heavy wrecking vehicles into shops, factories, skyscrapers, farms, windmills and train stations.Apart from the disaster movie frame story, the game offers not much of an explanation for its gameplay. You will be cast into bonus levels that have you drive around in a maze chased by four bulldozers a la Pacman, find yourself on a giant pooltable pushing crates into the pockets -- see things blow up in the brightest greens and blues or witness little people scurrying away, letting out ~Defender-esque~ screams for help. And wait until you see the final bonus levels...Vehicles: The vehicles all handle totally different and the control setups vary as well (although you can switch them to be all the same). A quick rundown: Ramdozer: A medium speed bullldozer that can level buildings by directly driving into them or push TNT crates into though ones Backlash (our favorite): A heavy truck that slides sideways into buildings (hold down L or R to slide) Skyfall: A fast buggy that should (as the name says) smash into buildings from a higher point, such as a hill, dam or a bridge. Use the turbo boost for the right momentum. Thunderfist: A huge silver robot with a destructive fist. Somersault into buildings. Cyclone Suit: A yellow robot, tumbles into buildings. J-Bomb: An armored mech with two rockets on his back. Fly high into the air and stomb buildings into the ground. Very cool. Ballista: A fast tricycle with missiles. Good for taking out obstacles from a distance. Sideswipe: A long wrecking truck that delivers ~punches~ sideways.In addition to the wrecking machines, there are four passenger cars: two American race cars, an A-Team van and a police car (yes, you can switch on the siren).In order to clear a level you not only have to destroy buildings, but often need to solve certain puzzles as well. Blocks have to be pushed into holes in the ground, ships have to be lined up to form a path, pathways have to be found, cranes have to be operated, and TNT crates have to pushed into blockades. You will have to get out of your vehicles at times, walk around on foot and even drive the ships and trains yourself (forward and backward only), bring them into position and then drive your vehicle on top to reach other areas.GameplayControl is hard at first, but soon you'll be sliding into structures like there's no tomorrow. I like the fact that each vehicle handles slightly different. It gives the game a lot more depth. The early levels are rather easy, but later on it can get pretty tough. A little example: You're on a hill with your missile bike, you can see the carrier in the distance heading for some containers, but you can't get down there. First you shoot some of the containers from the hill as quickly as possible, then you get out of the Ballista and walk down where you find the Ramdozer. Smash the remaining containers. There's a crane around the corner and six TNT crates and some barriers you can't destroy with your dozer blocking a bridge. As the carrier comes closer, you give up trying to do anything with the crane (lousy crane!) and use your dozer to combine four crates and push them into the eight barrier blocks. It works (and it's even faster than the crane): they blow. Over you go, the carrier is right behind you (sweat's trickling from your forehead...). Oh no: holes in the ground. Quickly push the right blocks into the holes -- doh! not that one, you need it to go through another passage first to get two more pieces. Come back, smash some oil tanks, there's the final piece! Just in time. A river! Line up three boats so that the carrier can pass, drive over, the smell of victory is in the air... A gigantic building stands in your way. You need TNT. Get on the first boat, drive it to an island, get the crate, unload... Kabaaaang -- the missile carrier hits the building. Not good enough, better luck next time...GraphicsThe game is seen from a 3/4 view most of the time. The camera can be zoomed in and out and rotated left or right but it is fairly restrictive. At first glance, the game looks like Micro Machines or Rare's own R.C. Pro-Am gone bad. I mean that in a good way. Excellent vehicle animation and very cool metal surfaces. Rare has really come up with some fine texture maps: Night levels have illuminated buildings and lights that look like the real thing. Some canyons and bridges will make you pause in awe, and the trains, bridges and houses all have a very cool weathered look. The environment and the cars are 100% polygons -- the 3D effect is perfect (virtually no polygon break-up, very few seam lines, no pixelation). And best of all: No fogging! Sometimes you will drive down a mountain, or the camera will show you a low angle and you can see for miles. I really wish there was a way to play the game from a first-person perspective, too (there is actually one level where you control the Cyclone Suit and the camera follows you in a low angle. Very cool), or let you at least look around more. (I think we have grown so accustomed to ~free 3D~ that a restrictive 3/4 perspective can be quite a bother). The explosions are also very nice, with different colors, falling debris and sparks, but not quite on the same level with Turok's. Your cars all have a shadow, which also serves as an indicator where you are when you're behind a structure or inside a tunnel. Some nice effects: Your tires can leave skid marks on the tarmac and some buildings show damage when you first hit them and don't crumble to rubble right away. Which brings me toSoundGood explosions with convincing crumbling and crashing sounds are complemented by some very nice engine sounds and plenty of tire screeching (but not enough bass). The music is very upbeat, somewhere in between 70s Pop, disaster movie score and Country Bear Jamboree. It sounds pretty good with some nice drum kicks in a couple of the songs (the country song with the mouthharp gets on my nerves though...) and the music plays faster when time's running out. As with all N64 games lately, there's a lot of voice. Your team members will once in a while make a comment on how you're doing -- and there is even a countdown in one of the coolest bonus levels ever (you have to finish the game to get to it). The game doesn't take itself too seriously sometimes, which is nice: If you try to get out of your car and it's blocked, your guy says ~doh!~ and when you're driving the ~A-Team~ van and press the R button you'll hear a tribute to Mr. T: ~Outta my way!~ (the ~Dukes of Hazard~ and ~Starsky and Hutch~ cars have appropriate sounds, too.)SecretsAfter you finish a level, you have to go back in to smash more buildings, activate RDUs (i.e. lights) and discover some more things to get a gold medal (and a promotion). There are six professors hidden throughout the levels (they are really not that hard to find though), communication points that open bonus levels and sometimes you have to first find your cars to finish the level. Blow up giant Moai heads with TNT, too... Hidden bonus rounds let you race on different tracks (you have to break a certain record to achieve gold), or smash things in a time limit. Like in Mario Kart 64, you can drive against your own ghost car. Finish the game with a perfect score for an extra surprise.OptionsOne difficulty level only. EEPROM and Memory Pak saving (the EEPROM doesn't save all the data, though), two volume settings, two control schemes (you can also use the D-Pad with most vehicles). One little annoyance: the game automatically creates four 14-page save points on your pak -- I would have liked a choice in these matters.Shortcomings: The game is simply too short. As with Rare's other major hit, Donkey Kong Country, there are tons of bonus levels that make the game longer (and after you finish them all with gold, there are a few more, and after you finish them -- well, then the game asks you to beat them all again in less time). But I personally prefer ~real levels,~ where I have to stop the missile carrier over little bonus car races that aren't required to advance in the game. And there are definitely not enough of those (although the ones that are there are fantastic and challenging -- and wait until you finish the game for some unique additional levels). I think that gamers don't want to be able to play through a game in a day, even if there are tons of bonus levels left to be discovered (you can easily finish the game over the week-end if you rent it). Having said this, some of the bonus levels are a lot of fun and the ability to compete with your buddy's best times (mem pak makes it possible) adds to the replay value. The lack of an optional first person perspective or (at times) the inability to zoom out further also come to mind. The invisible borders that limit the play-field are a pain, but tolerable. Most of the time, you will simply bump into some invisible wall when you get to the edge of the board -- which can be rather annoying when you're flying or exploring by car. And why, oh why, Rare, have you not included a two-player mode? This game is ideal for two player competitions (and it would have raised the bonus levels to a totally new level of meaning).Sharp graphics, good sound and addictive gameplay make Blast Corps a sure hit (not to              mention the low price). The different vehicles keep this game from getting boring -- and flying              J-Bomb Pilotwings-style is a real treat. However, I think that there are too many bonus levels and too few              real ~missile carrier out of control~ missions. The shortness of the game and the lack of a true two player              mode are the only things that kept this game from dethroning Wave Race or Mario Kart in my list              of all-time N64 favorites. But if you're willing to compete for best times in bonus levels, this game seems              to offer neverending fun. As it is, Blast Corps can proudly stand up there with the Miyamoto games and it              shows Rare's true potential when given an original concept. I'm glad I bought it, and I'll definitely              keep it.", "date": "Mar 27, 1997"}
