Majesco, however, wasn't a videogame publisher back in the SNES days...but the company recently snagged the rights to many titles that shipped during those days, including a mild success from Absolute called Turn and Burn. Majesco and GBA developer Virtucraft took the design and shrunk it down for play on the Game Boy Advance in F14 Tomcat, but don't expect anything beyond an arcade shooter parading as a basic, extremely bare-boned flight combat simulator.  Features More than a dozen missions to complete. Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridges needed) Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  As capable as the Game Boy Advance is, it's not exactly a powerhouse to bring a realistic flight combat title to the system -- and we're not asking for one, either. The best thing about combat is blowing stuff up, and that's the whole foundation of the F-14 Tomcat -- fly over the endless blue sea, take out some fighters with a variety of weaponry, and land the multi-million-dollar beast when the skies are clean. Games like After Burner in the arcade and Blue Lightning on the Atari Lynx provided similar simplistic but intense enjoyment even without the 3D capabilities. But in the case of F-14 Tomcat, keeping the action exclusively over the ocean means that there's not a whole heck of a lot you can do for level design.   Oh, sure, there are dozens of missions to plow through, but they all boil down to flying to Point A, taking out Target B all the while defending against MiG C, D, and E. The challenge is certainly there, since you spend half the harder missions outrunning heatseeking missiles and trying to lock onto enemy craft...but that's all there is. The only variety comes from the changing of the graphic's color scheme when the missions fly from daytime to dusk. It's the same sky and the same ocean mission after mission after mission. And what would seem like the most challenging part of the game turns into a simple task: landing the craft on the carrier. As long as you have a basic grasp of where the throttle is, just point the nose down at the grey blob in the ocean and follow the on-screen text. Easy as that.   The game does push the Game Boy Advance in decent directions, providing a semi-3D effect in the same fashion as several GBA and SNES racing games do. The interface even allows players to change the camera to check the jet's six during tight combat situations. While the bitmap explosions are a little silly and clumsy, the designers did throw in a cool little FMV videoclip on the jet's dashboard monitor for when the missiles smack into a MiG (an animation that looks like it was stolen from Top Gun footage). F-14 Tomcat even supports the link cable so that four players can dogfight over the ocean...thumbs up to Majesco for continuing to push developers in working with the system's network capabilities.   I wish I could write more about F-14 Tomcat, but in all honesty, there just isn't much to say -- what's here is cool, if a bit vanilla. Controls are tight, graphics are clean, the missions are challenging, and the link cable mode works like a champ. But this game is only good in single shots due to the fact that the missions don't offer any variety. If the missions actually went on the land, then we'd have something -- but the engine wasn't made to have 3D buildings, so over the ocean the game must stay. Maybe a sequel can add a bit of mission diversity.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
