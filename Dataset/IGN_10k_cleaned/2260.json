I'm talking about things like a sense of speed, authentic jet and weapon noises and those elements of realism that make a game fun, but not too much like a flight simulator. In Konami's Air Force Delta Storm it seems we're given the awesome war planes and very little else in the way of gameplay, story or presentation.   Maverick, Sundown and your boy, Iceman wouldn't be caught dead in a game like this because there's not much piloting skill required even when you set up the advanced control scheme. Lou Gossett Jr. couldn't even get busy in Air Force Delta. In what will likely be a disturbing trend early on for the Xbox, AFDS looks spectacular and makes an outstanding technology demonstration, but if you like playing your games instead of watching them, your air combat game is still waiting in the wings somewhere.  Gameplay Where to begin. There are 40 some odd real life aircraft featured in Air Force Delta Storm but you have to have enough money to buy them when they become available. You earn cash for completing objectives and wasting enemies. Sometime those two things are not one in the same. In each mission there will be a handful, sometimes only one, mission critical target that needs to be destroyed before you will advance. So if there are three bogeys out there, and you only have to kill one of them (he'll be highlighted in red on your radar and HUD) the other two would be just for fun.   I have no problem with this basic mercenary scheme, but this game ends up being extremely monotonous because it takes a crapload of money to buy planes, each mission only yields so much cash and the enemies hardly pose a threat to you. You can easily get through a typical mission without much worry and collect your cash, but where's the fun in that? You literally follow the red blip on your radar until either the ground or air target (you won't know until you're right on top of them) shows up, lock on to 'em with your missiles and away they go. Pick up your check and move on. You can play Air Force Delta for a good 90 minutes straight without ever having to worry about getting shot down. I couldn't tell you what happens after 90 minutes because the Xbox gets switched off out of tedium at that point and plus, inexplicably, pausing the game and quitting isn't an option in Air Force Delta Storm. You either succeed or fail, there is no quit.   While we're at it, I'd like to continue with what you cannot do in AFDS. This is a flight sim on the mighty Xbox console, so I was disappointed when I wasn't allowed to watch a  mission briefing or takeoff sequence with an in-game cinema. I mean, graphically this game isn't doing much more than moving some aircraft models around a wide open environment surrounded by detailed terrain and building textures. So I'm sure there's room on the DVD for a little clip here or there to keep you in the air combat mood.   The strategy in Air Force Delta Storm is to choose the right jet for each mission because you can only pick your aircraft when you're at a base and you never know when you're going to be back to pick another one. In a somewhat confusing storyline and gameplay mechanic, you end up having to fight your way through enemy controlled areas to reach an objective where your mission actually begins. So you have to take a plane's fuel, weapons and armor ratings into consideration and pick one that will allow you to reach the enemy in one piece and have enough left over to take care of business. This would be an intriguing feature if the enemies represented any kind of real threat at any point in the game.   There's no difficulty setting to make the bad guys any more dastardly and unlocking planes only serves to satisfy your curiosity rather than give you any significant advantage over your foes. In fact, the only way I was able to enjoy AFDS at all was when I blasted a little ~Danger Zone~ to get me in a Top Gun kind of mood. I would've ripped a CD of the entire movie's soundtrack and used it in the game, but Air Force Delta Storm doesn't allow for that either. For the first time ever, I actually listened to Kenny's lyrics and really got into the deeper meaning of what he was trying to say. I'm not sure but I think I completed the mission. Maybe not. Who knows? All that matters is that Kenny Loggins, with the hit theme song from Caddyshack already in his arsenal, was an extremely underrated star of the early 1980s and something needs to be done about it.   Graphics The aircraft in Air Force Delta Storm are flat out stunning. From nose to tail you can see every plate, every bolt and every warning label on these planes especially when you watch a replay of your mission. We're talking Gran Turismo-quality replays that you will want to watch with the excellent lighting and shadow effects. Of course, that's only if you can stay interested throughout the mission to make it to the replay. Missiles actually detach from their mounts and streak away with startling accuracy. Of course they re-appear magically a few seconds later, but that's how things work in videogames. The point is everything about the jet fighters from the after burners to the flaps to the squadron insignia on the tail looks real enough to get Konami in trouble with a variety of federal governments.  The planes in AFDS, like the Corsair, Thunderbolt and Tomcats all look authentic down to the finest details. You don't have to be an Air Force cadet to be able to recognize and appreciate the differences between all of the fighter jets. If you've seen an Air Force recruiting commercial, any of the Iron Eagle movies or even Independence Day you'll feel very comfortable with these babies.  The little animation there is in the game is decent. The flaps and ailerons actually move when you turn, bank and roll. It's all synched up to look as if the flaps are doing the work and redirecting the aircraft. Other than that you get a few enemies flying around a tank or two on the ground rolling by. That's about all you'll see as far as movement in AFDS.   The textures on the ground, mountains and buildings seem detailed enough, but it's rare that you'll be able to appreciate them zooming by at 700 mph. If you're going that fast that close to the ground, a mountain or a building in AFDS, then you're in deep trouble. But from a distance the structures are impressive, especially the cities at night.   And really the replays are where Air Force Delta Storm shows off its beauty. Your replays are on a continuous loop so you can watch them for as long as you'd like. The automatic, switching camera angles really show off whatever action there is in the mission, mixed in with some fantastic beauty shots of the aircraft.   Sound Air Force Delta is one of those games that could certainly benefit from widescreen TV and surround sound capabilities. How cool would it have been to hear the jet sounds rumbling out of your subwoofer and the scream of the turbines all around you? Even without those additional audio features, the sound of this game is adequate. In this case, however, adequate is really disappointing because, once again, Air Force Delta Storm isn't doing so much that it needed to skip out on the sound elements. Real life samples of jet sounds wouldn't have been too much to ask for.  Nobody talks to me in Air Force Delta Storm. At all. There's no Viper or Jester chattering over the radio or Goose hollering, ~great balls of fire!~ There's no voice acting because there are no characters in the game to develop. This lack of characters may actually be a different issue for another place in this review, but it's made apparent when evaluating the game's sound because there's so little to listen to. It's like it's quiet, too quiet.  I wasn't very familiar with the first Air Force Delta game on the Dreamcast so I was able to come into Storm with a relatively open mind. But I do know that the DC had lots technology demos masquerading as games early in its lifecycle and that appears to be the case here. The gameplay comes across as an afterthought because it's barely there. The lack of features is the other dead give away that AFDS is better watched than played. Microsoft might sell a couple dozen more Xboxes if enough retailers leave the demo mode of AFDS running for a couple of hours at a time. It looks that impressive. But woe to any poor soul that picks the game up thinking he's going to be the Xbox version of Tom Cruise. That kind of thinking is risky business.", "date": "Nov 14, 2001"}
