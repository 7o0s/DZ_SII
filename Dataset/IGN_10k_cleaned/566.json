NBA Hangtime delivers an arcade-perfect port to the home with god sound, fun, recognizable play, graphics on par with the arcade game, createable players, and lots of options. But it should be said that this style of play isn't for everybody.   NBA Hangtime's weaknesses -- it's really an arcade game more than a sports simulation -- were recognized early by its developers, who have covered nearly all gamers' wish lists quite readily. This arcade style formula has gained many supporters, and has proved extremely popular, despite its simplistic, aggressive play. Following in the footsteps of its former title, NBA Jam, everything here is imaginative, or of you will, supernatural. Characters jump to incredible heights, perform moves Michael Jordan (who isn't in the game) would awe at, and, on its default mode, perform blocks and defensive play that move beyond technical fouls, extending to ejections and the like. But, that's why it's a videogame, so we can leave reality behind.  Gameplay is based on the two-on-two approach. One to four players can join in any time, and teams of two-on-two can play with no slowdown. Granted, the simple graphics and digitized heads of real NBA players probably don't use up half of the Nintendo 64's actual processing power, and the frame rate wasn't high to begin with. The challenge against experienced players or against the game's tough AI on any level provides lots of replay value and encourages the kind of determination and competition found in professional sports. What's nice too, is that the controls are fairly simple, and even cool moves, like alley-oops, somersault dunks, and double dunks are quickly attainable. Head fakes, fading shots, and dribbling maneuvers complete the flexibility and thoroughness of the controls on offense, enabling gamers to add subtlety to a title that needs it. And defensive moves like stealing can really turn a game around; it's nice too that defensive players can catch up from behind using the turbo button.  For those nutty, overly focused sports fans who've just got to play their favorite player, there's good news. All of the NBA teams and players, with fully updated (relative to its development) team trades and rookies are there (with the exception of Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neil, and Charles Barkley).   Also, for the less than orthodox gamer, Midway's arcade port enables the creation of their own players, human or other. Many elements go into creating your own player: head size and kind (wolves, kids, Santa Claus, clowns, chickens), physical attributes, nicknames (Bubba, Spanky, Zippy, etc.), uniforms, stats, privileges, and let's just say that funky combinations are easily available. Also, many of these characters can have attributes NBA players don't have, which puts them at an advantage. This is easily one of the coolest elements of the game, and separates it from the pack.   The music and sound effects are no more than good. The standard rap music accompanying almost every basketball event, game, or merchandise commercial is here, and gets the blood flowing. Player grunts and crowd noise is good, too. But the announcer has to be the best in his quick, different, on-time descriptions, without being too annoying.  Last, the game is full of options, a trademark of home games that try to improve over their arcade brethren, and a hallmark for Midway. There are substitutions (though only at half-time), control configurations, Tournament Mode (disabling power ups and AI assistance), big heads, tag arrows, shot clock, difficulty, sound effects, and other selections gamers will enjoy.   In the final analysis, NBA Hangtime is afun, arcade-perfect port that will bring mostbasketball fans lots enjoyment. NBA Hangtimefills a necessary gap in the sports genre,and Midway has executed a solidconversion -- with four-player capabilities-- at a relatively early stage in the system'sgame cycle. However, there is very littleimprovement in gameplay, graphics, orsound that couldn't appear on a Saturn,PlayStation, or even Super NES. Andtechnically, it's a little bit of anembarrassment to show your friends yourcool new, 64-bit system, and then playNBA Hangtime, which takes advantage ofnothing N64 has to offer.", "date": "Jan 28, 1997"}
