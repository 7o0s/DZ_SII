A vast wasteland of stars, nebulae, gas giants and drifting Cold War era debris, the celestial heavens have beckoned scholars and adventure seekers for centuries.  Unfortunately, they've also sparked the imaginations of countless misguided game designers, who've churned out crappy sci-fi titles by the galactic cruiserload.  It's the reason why most consumers get more spooked than if they'd seen Mr. Spock ballroom dancing in the nude when even cutting edge starfighter sims like Freespace 2 and Independence War hit the shelves.  In such an inhospitable climate, one must naturally wonder where a decent yet unspectacular futuristic point n' click adventure like The Ward is gonna fit in.  Plot-wise, this title kicks it way oldschool.  Players become hot shot astronaut, David Walker, sent to the moon as part of the Apollo XIX's crew.  After watching all other fellow team members get roasty toasted by alien agressors and blacking out, you'll wake up none the worse for wear, but utterly clueless.  Alone, scared, and desperately in need of a tall, frosty glass of Tang, the poor bugger must escape from an alien building complex post haste.  Where the man goes next and how his destiny unwinds is slowly revealed via a linear tale that's actually well delivered throughout the course of play.  If you can excuse the low production values, cheesy cinematics and programmer's girlfriend's cousin's recited voice-overs, the game quickly justifies its virtually wholesale sticker price.  The blame lies with the plausible and interesting puzzles that were built in.  Unlike Dreamcatcher's imported stinkers, The Ward caters to American audiences, sporting conundrums which can be logically solved by a reasonably intelligent human being in a plausible amount of time.  Each mindbender takes a good, solid ten minutes or more of thought, though the trickier ones last even longer.  And just in case you can manage force fields and color coded switches but can't handle reconstructing a mosaic or something equally difficult, hints pop up every so often as a way of saying 'Relax, Homey.'  While younger gamers will need parental guidance, adventurers age 14 and up should be able to comfortably plow through the program without a helping hand.  Much of the gameplay leans towards basic item collection and/or usage.  Keycards, laser guns, alien arifacts and additional important objects rapidly fill a spaceman's inventory, though the intended purposes of most can be divined at a glance.  As a rule of thumb, instinct and logic will overcome any obstacle.  Of course there are also times when a more roundabout way of thinking is required. Not every participant will automatically realize they should manipulate a control panel to lower and unlock a scalpel blade, thereby providing the tool needed for sawing a ring off a dead alien trooper's finger.  Because folks cannot venture beyond a handful of rooms regardless of their current location, becoming lost and stuck is almost unthinkable.  That's what you call sincere forethought on Fragile Bits' part, ladies and gentlemen.  Conversely, what you'd call lame is the overall presentation.  The Ward's grainy, unimpressive backgrounds are so 1996.  The same goes for the main character and his pals, portrayed as video captured animations smushed onto the sterile environments.  While several neat, otherworldly locales grace the product, none matches the haunting beauty or heavy symbolism of scenes found in recently released rivals such as The Longest Journey.  It's hard to take the product seriously because of the low production values which sabotage all audio-visual components save the wonderful soundtrack.  But what more would you ask of a budget priced offering?  That The Ward provides several hours of fairly good entertainment for less than a twenty spot alone earns it two gnarled, muscular PC gaming addict's thumbs up.  Whether or not this amusing yet visually outdated bad boy actually brings home the bacon for On Deck Interactive is another story entirely; horror, not sci-fi, mind you.  Although the suits will surely scream bloody murder, the rest of us will benefit marvelously from the launch of their new retro style point n' click escapade.  Besides, enjoy it while it lasts, buckaroo, 'cause any hopes for a sequel or spin-off of this sci-fi shenanigan will likely burn up long before they reach orbit.  -- Scott Steinberg     Want to share your opinions with the world?
