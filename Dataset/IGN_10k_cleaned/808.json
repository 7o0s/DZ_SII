What an incredibly perplexing creation.  On one hand, they can be beautiful, intelligent, compassionate, engaging, and on occasion, down right awe inspiring.  On the other, they can be ugly, spiteful, shallow, heartless, ambiguous and deliberately deceptive to the point of frustration that borders on insanity.   But still, we come back for more.  And apparently, Eidos is completely content to laugh at the cravings of the average male, as the fourth installment of the Tomb Raider series has come to the Dreamcast.  Lara Croft is back, and has most certainly matured into the leading lady of video gaming, but is she the girl you hope you're going to marry, or that bitch you still can't believe you got suckered into dating? Let's explore, shall we? Seems only fitting, this being Tomb Raider and all . . ..  The funny thing is, writing this review is a bit like playing the game. Where to start.  So many possibilities, so many directions I could begin with . . . but what to do, what to do . . ..  I'd say I don't have a clue, but unfortunately, the problems with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation are a bit more cut and dry than its puzzles, so to hell with a tribute to the game, let's get our hands dirty.  I'll start by explaining the above sarcasm by saying that, without question, Tomb Raider 4 has to be the most intentionally aimless title I have ever seen.  It alerted to me a painfully clear split in philosophy for what makes a good game, and unfortunately, I can't say that I will ever empathize with the school of thought that pushed this game out on an unsuspecting public.  How to put this . . . Um, I absolutely despised trying to play this game. Not just because the control is horrendous (which I will expand upon later), but because the designers are either evil or have no earthly idea of what makes a game fun.  The thing is, the original Tomb Raider sort of got it.  I continually found myself completely enveloped in a sense of awe and enjoyment while playing this game, and will never forget the time we slam-packed over 18 guys into my dorm room for over 5 hours when we closed in on the game's ending.  But this?  This is just bordering on offensive.  The puzzles are not of the ~Hmm...I can't go here, but I see that thing over there...perhaps I should do that and see if it does this~ variety.  They are more of the ~I just walked in this room...there's uhh....stuff in it...what the #$%@ am I supposed to do now~ variety. Instead of trying to lead you to one logical conclusion, the puzzles in TLR seem to attempt to drive you away from every possible logical conclusion until only the most illogical things are left. Then, out of sheer desperation, you finally trip and fall over the answer and stumble forward into the next overly complicated, incredibly vague set of puzzles.  Sounds like fun, huh?  It just drove me nuts.  I literally had to take a break from this game because I grew more and more angry with things with every death. Reason being that, unlike most games with puzzles, you don't die trying to solve the solution, you die trying to discover it. Walk in to a room, count to three, get impaled.  Walk back into said room, look up, get impaled.  Walk in yet again, look down, whack.  Walk back in, look left, slice.  Walk back, right, poke. Back. Jump. Dead.  ARRRRGH!!!!  Maybe I am just slow, but I have seen soooo many games graduate to a more illuminated state of design, and proceeded to entertain me so completely that I can't help but not care if my tastes are in the wrong.  The core of what is supposed to drive this game is so intentionally counter-intuitive that it makes me wonder why this was ever popular, because for me, this will never be enjoyable. Ever. Compared to the likes of  MDK2 and even Eidos' own Kain 2, this game is almost an insult to the genre.  I mean, some games will slap you on the wrist and say ~No, don't do that.~  This game just hits you in the back of the head with a brick while yelling ~STUPID,~ when 9 times out of 10, you're just following the most logical path. Quite frankly, I don't play action games to be deliberately screwed with. I am all about living up to the challenge, but don't sit back and laugh at me eating it because you keep telling me the challenge is something else.  That is just bad game design.  Granted, when ancient civilizations set booby traps, they didn't think ~How can I make this obvious so Joe Explorer can get out of it.~ But, by the same token, world renowned explorer Lara Croft doesn't walk into a tomb completely ignorant to the trapping and tricks of an ancient civilization  that would just be irresponsible of her. A few well-done cinemas here or audio clues there showing off her ~experience and expertise~ could have easily made this a lot less annoying, and I simply do not understand why someone hasn't bothered to address this.  Not to mention the fact that the game's control is still so unnecessarily cumbersome that making it to an objective can often be even more annoying than figuring out what said objective should be. The game doesn't take advantage of analog at all, and swapping between analog and digital to walk and run is just plain idiotic.  Even first generation Dreamcast products offered incremental movement response from the controller, and in this game, where it would be immensely helpful, anything less is completely insulting, not to mention incredibly frustrating.  How am I supposed to make the kind of precise movements this game's unbelievably overdone puzzles require of me if merely switching between paces is enough to get me killed due to an inadequate set-up? No thank you.  And no, I don't feel sorry for Eidos because of the Dreamcast controller's admitted lack of quality and diversity. Several other developers have gotten around it, and if they would have spent all of two minutes thinking about how to make this game a worthwhile effort in cross-platform development, things like this would not have even been an issue.  But just one look at this game will tell you they didn't.  And that is yet another reason I suggest you stay very far away from this game.  In addition to a complete lack of plausible direction and shoddy control, this game also happens to be choppy as hell on a system that could easily handle its geometry and features some seriously butt-ugly texture work. The game absolutely collapses in comparison to nearly every other Dreamcast game we've seen in the genre to date, and all of those are basically first-generation efforts.  The overall look of the game has its style, that much is sure, and the level design itself is actually pretty darn creative, but if you inspect it to any degree beyond a surface level, it comes off as incredibly mediocre.  To add to the game's visual hum-drum, the camera work often gets in the way of the action, and got me killed way more than I would have liked it to. Pretty inexcusable for a fourth generation effort, don't you think?  Ack. I could go on about all the things that are wrong with this pitiful excuse for entertainment, such as a lack of VGA support (which existed in early builds and has no reason to be excluded) or the clipping that actually manages to adversely effect gameplay -- but I won't make this any worse than it already is.  I'll close with this: There are so many better places you could be putting your money that I cannot stress enough that this game simply is not worth your time. Even if you liked the rest of the series, I am here to tell you that there is a better life out there -- just look at Eidos' own efforts like Soul Reaver and SotB.   Unless you actively try to avoid this sort of rubbish, it will continue to plague our industry, and I for one have had enough. Go out and buy it if you've got some odd obsession with making Eidos rich via your frustration, but if you want to have fun, go pick up a real game like Kain, MDK2 or Rayman 2. This is just painful.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 25, 2000"}
