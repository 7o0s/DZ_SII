While not quite as tactically savvy a game as September's Company of Heroes, Battle for Middle-earth II deserves some credit for presenting the world of Middle-earth with such clarity and fun. With the game's success and such a powerful combined book and movie license backing it up, it's unsurprising to see an expansion pack. Since the whole history of Tolkein's fully developed fantasy universe could be accessed, EA decided to take a trip back in time and give players a chance to glimpse the battles that caused the downfall of the kingdoms of men and the rise of Mordor's greatest captain. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II -- The Rise of the Witch-king adds a decent new campaign, a new faction, and new units to existing factions while improving other aspects of gameplay like War of the Ring mode and Create-a-Hero. It's not the most exciting expansion pack of the year, but it adds enough new content and fixes that fans of BFME 2 shouldn't be disappointed.    The history of Middle-earth is gigantic enough that 3000 years pass between the Last Alliance battle shown at the beginning of the first Lord of the Rings movie and Bilbo's discovery of the One Ring in The Hobbit. Plenty happened in the 3000 year absence of the One Ring, including a major brawl in the northern lands of men between the kingdoms of Arnor and Angmar. The expansion pack focuses on the Witch-king's campaign to destroy the kingdoms of men in the north. While an epilogue level gives players the chance to step into the shoes of the good races, this expansion's campaign is all about evil.   Campaign scenarios vary from decent to great. High points like the Dark Lord's Eye scenario are accompanied by missions like a defensive siege at Carn Dum which compared to previous games, just isn't as exciting. Even the final mission takes place on a map that's simply retooled for the time period. It plays almost the same as it did the first time around with the only major differences from improved AI and the forces involved. Amon Sul is clever enough to be fun, but the design of the walls around the fortress and responsiveness of the enemies inside isn't quite what I'd hoped it would be. The last mission in an epilogue portion is disappointingly anti-climactic. Overall, there's certainly a good amount of enjoyment to be had, even if it doesn't pack quite the same punch as the original two campaigns did for me.   A small bit of my disappointment may have to do with the presentation of the Angmar faction, which plays fine and has a couple of interesting new units, but doesn't have the visual punch that the other races have for me. The trolls in particular are more cartoony than frightening and powerful. I can't tell you how many folks walked by my desk and asked where I got the cool attack sheep. When told they were actual Snow Trolls subsequent comments weren't so grand. Troll animations are also less than thrilling. The power and rage of the cave trolls is missing here.    From a gameplay perspective, Angmar has some interesting ideas. Two of the unit types in particular can cause serious problems when used correctly. The problem is that there's a lot of micromanagement involved in using them right. The Thrall Masters are my favorite of the two. These lone units have the power to call in one of four battalions of units at any moment. Once the units are called, there's no changing the decision, but being able to lure cavalry into a group and then calling in spearmen or coming across archers and calling in some wolf riders can throw a wrench into enemy plans. The Sorcerers are even trickier. These magic casters have some useful spells, but their mana comes from the acolytes surrounding them. Once the acolytes are gone, so is the mana. The problem is these acolytes die so easily and the range on most sorcerer spells is so short that it's freaking hard to get a spell off fast and accurately enough before too many acolytes (or the sorcerer himself) have been killed. On top of that, the sorcerers can specialize in one of three areas which opens up one more very useful spell. You can tell the different specializations apart by the staff they're carrying, but try that in the thick of battle. My only real solution has been to assign different sorcerer groups their own individual control group. While this can work, it can also be pretty confusing to keep track of in an already fast paced game. At this point I've basically given up on using them. I just don't have the patience for it. The Angmar faction is pretty powerful faction at any stage in the game. I have concerns that the Snow Trolls may be a bit overpowered (they act as cavalry, are brilliant at killing cavalry, and can destroy buildings fairly well) but time will tell.    Each of the other factions has also gained new units to help in the battle. They range in usefulness and style, but in general, they basically plug holes in the defense of each faction or just provide some extra punch. For instance, the Haradrim Lancers fill in a much needed spot for cheap cavalry in the Mordor faction. Along with basic units are the new hero horde units. Only a certain number of them can be in the game at once, but each is a nasty surprise for any enemy. Units like the Elven Noldor warriors pack one hell of a punch and can switch between bows and swords on the fly and do equally well in both areas. The Dwarven Zealots are immune to fear and Mordor's Black Riders inspire it. Each of the factions has been given attention though Mordor has been given three new unit types while the Dwarves only get one.    Along with army units come new heroes for some factions for the purpose of filling out the hero ranks and allowing four leader heroes for each faction in the much improved War of the Ring mode. Battle for Middle-earth II added a lot of good features that made the mode fairly robust but there were still problems like undying heroes, maps inconsistencies, and the absence of real front-lines. Almost every problem I had with the mode has been addressed. The map has been redesigned for more accuracy including a bunch of new territories, regions (Gondor, Mordor, Rhun) that grant bonuses when all territories included are captured, heroes can move across two spaces of allied territory each turn, buildings produce resources which rules unit production, and historical scenarios with set sides and locations. There are two huge changes that alter the game dramatically. Heroes can be removed from the game now by cornering them on the strategic map and defeating them in battle. This allows for much more strategy in overland map movements. Armies are now also persistent from battle. This means units you create on the battlefield can be kept into the strategic map. This can be a huge advantage and actually encourages more play on the tactical maps. It also makes quick retreat a good solution when facing overwhelming odds. The faster you get out of battle the less units your opponent can make.   The only thing really missing from the mode now is a navy component, which is noticeably absent from basically all aspects of the expansion. My only real complaint with War of the Ring mode at this point is the strategic AI. Many of the moves the computer makes on the living world map are pretty strange. I've seen the computer stupidly move armyless heroes into corners only to be destroyed, attack heavily defended territories with small armies, and disregard opportunities to corner and eliminate enemy heroes. I've also had AI retreat from battles even though there wasn't a territory to retreat to, losing their hero in the process without putting up a fight.    On the other hand, the tactical AI in the RTS skirmishes seems a bit smarter, faster, and meaner unless I'm really out of practice. Enemies will sneak around far corners of skirmish maps to attack from sneaky angles, maneuver fast cavalry in for quick hits on bases, and bring much better combinations of armies in for attack. Being as aggressive as it is, even medium AI can be fun to fight against and hard AI can cause serious problems.   Lastly, Create-a-Hero has been revamped to provide a more balanced approach to hero creation. Instead of a flat fee for custom heroes, players can create heroes with different numbers of powers. The more powers, the more expensive the hero will be in-game. A new hero type, the Troll class, has been added as well with a different power tree. More visual options are available, but not so many that players will notice a huge change.Overall, EA LA has created a good expansion with a lot of good additions. Angmar is an interesting faction, with options for those who love micromanagement but still plenty of options for those that dont. The campaign certainly has its moments but some design decisions and an Angmar faction that isn't as visually interesting as the rest of the evil factions makes it a little less appealing over all than I would have liked.The additions and fixes to War of the Ring mode make that style of play a much more inviting option this time around. There are still some AI issues on the strategic map and using navies needs to be an option, but overall, War of the Ring should bring plenty of hours of entertainment, especially for friends who are up for spending a few hours messing with each other over multiplayer.Despite a few issues, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II -- The Rise of the Witch-king is a solid gameplay expansion for BFME 2.", "date": "Dec 1, 2006"}
