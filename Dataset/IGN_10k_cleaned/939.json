I'll leave that to Blake & crew at  IGN Wrestling. I can appreciate watching the whole drama unfolding in the squared ring on random nights (what is it now, Monday, Thursday, Saturday?), but I couldn't tell you one super suplex from another. All I know from the sport is what I can do in videogame versions of the entertainment sport  and I've been playing them since Mat Mania in the arcade more than a decade and a half ago. Electronic Arts gets its first taste of the whole wrestling thing on the Game Boy Color with WCW Mayhem, a conversion of its series that hit the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 late last year.  There are some good and bad points about this title, but when it's all balanced out, it's the best wrestler on the handheld. It could be a whole lot better, though. Features Twelve wrestlers from the WCW Taunts, unique signature moves In and out of ring arenas Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color.   WCW Mayhem is a quick-and-dirty grapplefest featuring 12 of the ~big~ names in the WCW federation: Sting, Goldberg, Hollywood Hogan, Kevin ~Big Sexy~ Nash, Randy ~Macho Man~ Savage, Diamond Dallas Page, Bret Hart, Bam Bam Bigelow, Rick Flair, Buff Bagwell, Lex Luger and Booker T.  The fights take place in the main ring where you can pull off moves such as the standard punches and kicks, as well as the familiar piledrivers and throws against the rope (followed by the classic clothesline, of course).   The developers left realism outside the door  and that's where it should stay in a wrestling game. Like it or not, professional wrestling is wildly animated entertainment, and to ~simulate~ the actual fighting would dilute the craziness that pro wrestling brings to the table. Characters in WCW Mayhem are big-headed monstrosities that can throw opponents like flicking navel lint. Fights can take place outside or inside the ring  the two fighters can run out into the locker room and outside in an alley to brawl. But to win, you're going to have to pin the guy inside the ring.  Controls in WCW Mayhem are very tight, though it's of the usual ~grapple/luck of the draw~ button pounding fashion. The moves are pulled off by pushing the controller in a direction and maniacally tapping the A or B button while the two wrestlers lock horns. Occasionally, stools will be thrown into the ring, and you'll be able to grab it to smash over the head of your opponent.  Characters are generally similar in abilities  in fact, they all have the same standard moves. The only difference is how they actually look, and the special move that you can pull off when the other guy's power bar is in the red  pulled off by a series of specific button presses.  The game feels good to play, but it seems like it's missing so much. You can't pin an opponent unless you get him in a grapple. Which means, you literally can't do anything to him when he's kissing the canvas. What about a headstomp? How about grabbing him by the neck and bringing him to his feet? Not even a legtwist? Sorry folks, if the opponent is on his back, he's untouchable. Well, not completely  you climb the turnbuckle and try and drop down on him, but you're given so little opportunity, and it takes too long to get to the top.  And the problems don't limit themselves to the gameplay  take, for example, the ~Quest for the Best.~ It's great to actually have a tournament mode, but come on  you really expect me to play through all 12 wrestlers without a break? Are you nuts? At the very least, where's the password save? And I have to say it  the Game Boy Color can definitely handle better digitized graphics than what was used on the wrestler's profile screen. What happened there?  On the plus side, it seems that Electronic Arts is really focusing on the link cable aspect  just look at the box art. Prominently displayed at the top of Goldberg's head is a specific ~Game Link~ logo. And it works extremely well  instead of having a predictable computer opponent, you can go up against your friend. Definitely points awarded for EA's stance on supporting the link cable. The game is good, but not great  it really needs a few more options than what's offered here. Link cable is a great start...but WCW Mayhem just feels a bit too shallow. It's a notch above WWF Wrestlemania 2000, and just slams Acclaim's ECW Hardcore into the ground. For a first attempt back into the Game Boy market, Electronic Arts did good. Now, it's time to put a little more into their games in the next batch of titles.", "date": "May 19, 2000"}
