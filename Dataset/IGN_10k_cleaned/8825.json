When you start up the ~Arcade Game~ mode, you are treated to the original opening story sequence. Digital Eclipse slapped a bar on top of this that tells you to press the A Button to begin, making it impossible to read the last few lines of the text introduction. We are not off to a good start here.   But then the game starts and it is the Super Contra you know and perhaps have fond memories of. The original arcade game was not exactly easy and the difficult task of beating the brief game holds to this day. On the standard XBLA settings, you're afforded three lives and a limited number of continues. Take things online and you're given eight lives, but no continues. For a short game, this might seem like enough. With the side scrolling, shooting madness that is Super Contra, only the skilled will make it through alive. It was designed to be a quarter-muncher, after all, so the level of difficulty is no joke.   Things are made more difficult yet when you factor in the Xbox 360 controller. The analog stick is unwieldy for games designed around old-school arcade sticks such as Super Contra. The d-padwell enough has been written about that in the past for you to know that it is less than ideal. We won't beat a dead horse.    Oh boy. If you can manage the difficulty and controls, you'll find a game that looks significantly better than the original Contra, but doesn't hold quite the same nostalgia; especially if you think of the NES games when you think of Contra. A new top down view was added for the indoor areas of Super Contra as were inclined surfaces, but the gameplay is essentially the same as the first Contra. Grab the spread gun and start firing.    As is the case with most classic arcade games that have made their way onto the Xbox Live Arcade, Super Contra can be played in either the new enhanced graphics mode or with the original look. In the case of Super Contra, enhanced means some reworked explosion and gun effects, as well as an all around smoother look. The explosions look out of place and are overdone to the point of getting in the way of incoming bullets, but the smoothed sprites are done quite well.    The other new visual addition comes with the transition to a widescreen format. This transition has not been friendly to Super Contra. Or maybe we should say that Digital Eclipse has not been friendly to Super Contra. The borders filling the extra space on each side of the screen are easily the worst we've seen. Black bars would be more attractive than this wretched excuse for art. It's actually bad enough that it detracts from the gameplay experience because you just can't stop looking at them. It's like a train wreck; so horrible that you can't stop looking at it.   For some reason, the horrid borders take a break when you hop onto Xbox Live for a co-op game. Why? Maybe the code wasn't robust enough to run both the game and display some art without lagging? Oh wait, the game suffers from lag anyway. Finding a lag free game was far harder than it should have been. We met with success only a couple of times while repeatedly running into lag so bad that the game either disconnected or had to pause to re-sync. There really isn't a lot of data being transferred here and it shouldn't be that tough to make the game run smoothly. To be fair, the game plays significantly better online than when we tried to play the first Contra XBLA release. Significantly better than broken isn't much to write home about.    We went ahead and did the borders for the next XBLA Contra game. The only online mode available is a co-op affair. The achievements based around it are nice, as are the leaderboards that go across all modes of play, but there was one quirk that annoyed us. If your partner quits out after dying, your game ends too. That can be frustrating when you're in the midst of a good run and your online friend decides they're tired of watching you play.    The classic sounds of Super Contra are emulated fairly well and still manage to keep the adrenaline pumping. The enhanced effects aren't bad either, successfully bringing the themes and sounds of Contra into a more modern mix. It's too bad the visuals didn't get the same level of work.Super Contra stands the test of time a bit better than some of the other ~classic~ games that have been brought to the XBLA, but the proper amount of care and attention the game deserves wasn't given. From ugly borders and out of place visual effects to choppy net code, it's clear that a lot more work could have gone into this title.
