After being constantly teased with previews, taunted by ads, and tantalized with demos, it's no wonder we get juiced up enough to pee static electricity.  So you can imagine my chagrin at being assigned a title based on a leisure activity that involves lounging around, drifting off to sleep, and reeling in a fish now and then.  Even if you do manage to catch one of the scuzzy little muck dwellers, you've still gotta gut it too, just to get a lousy filet out of the deal.  When it comes to down to man vs. nature, guess who gets the last laugh?  Needless to say, I wasn't bursting with enthusiasm when I cracked open EA Sports' latest title, Championship Bass.  Yet right from the moment the intro flared to life, something didn't seem quite right.  It wasn't until the very moment I stopped my evaluation, however, days after it had first begun, that I realized what was amiss. Like a smack upside the head from a wet mackerel, it dawned on me that I was having fun...a LOT of fun.  Making this the point where I turn to the camera and say, ~Hot Damn!  This ain't your ordinary fishing game.~ Or I could just shut up and get on with the review.  Here's a shocker for you.  For one reason or another Electronic Arts decided to create an arcade style game as opposed to a hardcore simulation.  Sure, Championship Bass has got all the trappings of a really anal fishing sim, complete with every type of cast, lure, rod, and reel one could hope for.  It also attempts to recreate precise weather conditions, accurately model the behavior of the fish, and forces you to think about what spot on the lake offers the most ample supply of targets.  But from the second you set foot on your boat and make for the prime fishing spots, the focus is on entertainment value, not attention to detail.  Championship Bass actually features powerups, bonus items, special moves, and challenge based levels, so it's safe to say that this game falls just as easily into the action/arcade category as it does into the sports genre.  Not that this means we're getting skimped on the play options. If you're looking for a leisurely day at the lake, then head out on a pressure-free fishing trip.  Want some companionship or competition?  Log onto EA's server and participate in huge online tournaments.  Most people will probably want to stick to the challenge mode, however.  A series of contests grouped into blocks of five levels, challenge mode puts the player smack dab in the middle of specific scenarios.  These scenarios take place in different spots on different lakes, contain fish of various sizes and intellects, and boast a set number of bonus fish that can be caught.  Your goal in each scenario is simple enough...catch as many pounds of bass as possible.  Though you can only hold five of the buggers in your live well at any given time, the computer automatically lets the smallest go free when you exceed this limit.  Provided you catch enough pounds of fish in total across each block of scenarios to place in the top three rankings, you'll open up the next block for play.  Once you're on the lake, the first thing to do is tool about  in your boat with the help of the arrow keys.  After finding a promising spot like a weedy patch, clump of logs, or shady rock, it's time to select a rod, reel, and lure.  Using a simple point and click interface complete with pulldown menus, you can quickly pick out the size and color of your bait as well as the weight of your rod and line. This isn't just done for show, mind you, you've actually got to pick the right tools for the current job.  Slimy as they are, these fish are smart, and if you don't pick out a lure they like, you won't be getting any bites. It sounds odd, but half of the game's appeal comes from having to puzzle out what combination of gear will attract a bite or two.  Then again, if you don't like playing guessing games based on trial and error, this aspect of play loses a lot of its charm.  The next thing to do is place your cursor over the spot where you'd like your bait to touch down.  Click the mouse and voila, it's as simple as that.  As soon as your line hits the water, the view switches from a 3rd person behind the back shot to a camera angle centered upon the lure you've chosen.  This provides you with a reasonable view of what's going on over and under the water, depending on how deep your lure sinks.  And it gives you an opportunity to look the little scaly bastards right in the eye.  By wiggling the mouse left, right, up or down, you can make your bait jiggle about like a stripper, thereby enticing nearby fish.  At the same time you can also left click to drag the line back towards the boat or right click to give it a nasty jerk.   The second a fish chomps down upon the hook is where the game truly begins to shine.  Reeling in one of these beasts takes skill and finesse.  They'll try to shake the rod out of your grasp, swim into hard to reach spots, and break for the open seas.  Bearing this in mind, it's up to you to shake the line, increase or decrease the pull of your reel, and do what ever else it takes to bring a fish within grabbing distance.  An incredibly simple tension bar system lets you know how much stress is being placed on your line.  While you're in the green, everything's ok, but if the bar gets into the red, take heed of the warning signals and give the line some slack.  Refuse to do so and your line breaks, costing you the chance to fondle one of our little friends.  Words can't do justice to the experience, which involves whipping your mouse from side to side frantically as you flail about trying to keep the fish from getting away.  It's a thrilling ride all the way through, and I can't think of another PC fishing experience that even begins to compare to Championship Bass.  Your everyday, run-of-the-mill bass isn't the only inhabitant of these waters though.  In addition to crappie and other worthless species which attempt to eat your bait, golden-colored and red-eyed bonus fish can also be found.  By catching a bonus fish, you'll be rewarded with powerups or extra lures.  Powerups let you move your boat about without fear of spooking the fish, cast your line out further, gain extra time, or see where bass of a specific size are hiding just by looking out from your boat.  The special lures you'll collect, including oddities like the zone worm or super hawg frog, tend to be more effective than the mundane items found in your tacklebox.  Although they won't carry over from challenge to challenge, they're saved for permanent use on fishing trips.  And they look pretty durn cool too, dadgumit.  Per usual, leave it to EA Sports to come up with a presentation that's every bit as sharp as the gameplay.  Gorgeous water effects mingle with a mix of 3D lakeside scenery to create a plausible environment in which to play.  Although trees, weeds, sandy banks, and bodies of water don't make for the most thrilling surroundings, the peppy tune which plays in the background prevents you from dozing off. Ambient sound effects fill the air with the chirping of crickets and croaking of toads, lending an air of authenticity to the atmosphere. When a fish bites and the struggle begins, you'll swear you were placing an arcade racer, because the pace of the music picks up to a fever pitch and blaring sound effects serve as warning signals and alerts.  On the flip side, the voice acting is a bit limited, used only for pro tips and on sparing occasion during play.  It's a small price to pay considering how well the rest of the title comes off.  Is Championship Bass the best PC fishing game a casual player could hope for?  Definitely.  Could it be a great excuse to lock yourself in a room for days on end?  I'm ashamed to say yes.  So what's the downside?  Good luck coming up with an excuse as to why you've been behind closed doors for a week and your left or right handed grip is suddenly so powerful. This is the most fun you'll ever have for under $20. Unless of course you're planning to visit Thailand.   -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
