{"name": "Wrath Unleashed", "name_review": "Wrath Unleashed", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/10/wrath-unleashed", "text": "Once known for incredibly imaginative adventure games, then later an unending parade of sub-par Star Wars games (well, this is still going on actually), LucasArts' new reputation may revolve around one of the oldest genres in history: strategy. Last year LucasArts released Gladius, an excellent strategy game that was as much a homage to Final Fantasy Tactics as it was to Ridley Scott's Gladiator, while still adding its own unique touch to the genre. Now, the company is set to unleash (excuse the pun) Wrath Unleashed, another strategy game that has more in common with Archon than it does Final Fantasy Tactics.    The game's story is traditional in the sense that it involves the four elementals (earth, wind, fire, water), and light and dark orders and chaos. After a wild brouhaha that results in a power struggle amongst the gods, the battle begins. Not entirely original or surprising, but it gets the job done. Where the game really has to show its colors, though, is in the gameplay, and for the most part it succeeds.  Gameplay Wrath Unleashed is a turn-based, action-strategy game. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then Wrath isn't going to change your mind. But if you're even remotely interested in the genre, this game has a bit to offer. As mentioned before, the game is turn-based and takes place on maps composed of hexagonal pieces. For a strategy game, this is very standard. Board games that were around even before videogames used this format (as did one of my favorite games, Military Madness), so it's nice to see the tradition still carried on.     Starting from the surface working in, each turn starts out on the map screen. The ultimate goal is to either defeat all of your opponent's creatures. You move your characters around the map, gain mana points, and cast spells all from the map screen. Entering battle is as simple as selecting one of your creatures and moving it onto a piece occupied by an opponent's creature. Of course, they'll have to be within range of your creature to enter battle, but if and when they are, the game switches to a third-person action game.  Here's where the game gets a little more hands-on. Kind of like a watered down fighting game, you have full control of your creature. Each creature has light and heavy melee and magic attacks, and also the ability to auto-target/strafe. Combat feels a little loose, with a dependable strategy being, dodge then attack, dodge then attack. Also, the battles sometimes happen so fast that it's difficult to use magic effectively. With a little more polishing, the fighting could have went from good to great, but it still works for the most part.   This is all a very general overview of the core game mechanics. In fact, there are ton of other details you have to pay attention to if you want to make the most of every battle; what type of terrain you're on, how much mana you've accumulated, what type of creature you use, and what type of range your creature's have are some of the parameters that can turn the tide of war. Additionally, your Overlord and Adepts can cast spells during the map view. These can be anything from instant death spells (Wrath) to teleportation to healing spells. The mana points you use to cast spells is gained by occupying terrain with temples or citadels. In turn, a battle can also be won by capturing Temple points.   Besides the main campaign mode, Wrath Unleashed features a couple of multiplayer modes and a tutorial mode. Given the game's depth, it would have been nice to see a more thorough tutorial rather than one that asks the player to refer to the manual for more details. As for multiplayer, this game is obviously well-suited for friendly competition, though the lack of online play is a downer.   Wrath also includes an army builder that lets the player create a customized team. This is a great feature and all, but what fun is an army builder without a map builder? If the game would allow players to create their own maps and campaigns, given the simplistic map interface, this game could really take off. As is, it's just good enough.    Graphics While not immediately noticeable, there are a lot of subtleties that make Wrath Unleashed a good-looking game. You can think of the game's graphics in two parts: the map screen, and the real-time battle sequences. When on the map, the character models are small, and the hexagonal map pieces feature a bare amount of details. But what more can you expect, really? The map isn't there to impress. It's there to provide an interface for moving units. Still, even with its simple, barebones presentation, the map pieces animate fluidly, and there are a handful of good lighting and particle effects that are minor, but are enough to bring a little spice to the scene.  Then there are the battle scenes. Here's where you can really appreciate the graphics engine. The creature models are big, bright, and colorful, and are adorned with some of the zaniest-looking armor seen in a game. The also animate pretty well. The arenas are big, the camera's smart, and there's a good amount of interactive/breakable objects. The action during these sequences moves pretty quick so it's hard to really enjoy the details, but the game does look quite nice.   The cutscenes are also impressive. Again, the character models (especially those of the demigods') are highly detailed, with some really nice texture work and animations. The fact that the women models are half naked and wiggle their heinies when they walk doesn't hurt. Where most people will be torn is in regards to the art style. Using what comes off as a future-fantastical style, the art direction is a love-it-or-hate-it affair. An easy way to think about it is to ask yourself, ~When I think of a unicorn, do I want to picture a more traditional white horse with a horn protruding out of its head, or a purple beast with spiked armor, a fin in place of a mane, and a horn coming out of its chin?~ All of the other traditional creatures (centaur, genie, etc.) follow a similar design aesthetic.   Sound Epic battle music rules the day in Wrath Unleashed. Even on the map screen you feel like you're about to go into some heated battle with hordes of creatures. Overall the music has a dark, brooding battle theme to it and it fits the game well. The biggest issue here is that it's a bit too repetitive. Being a strategy game and all, having the music turned all the way down to allow for better concentration is always an option, and one I used more often than not.   The voice work in Wrath is better than average. No one here's taking home a Golden Globe mind you, but given the context of the story, the overly dramatic, verbose dialogue and somewhat trite voice acting actually work. Whether you find it funny or dramatic, you'll be entertained either way. The sound effects in the game are also well done. Again, nothing extraordinary, but each creature's howls, stomps, and smashes feel big and intimidating.  All in all, Wrath Unleashed is a solid title. The AI can sometimes be frustratingly stubborn, and the battles can take a long, long time to complete, but there's plenty to like here. The game is definitely a bit slower-paced than a lot of gamers are used to, and the learning curve is also a bit steeper than normal, but give it some time and you'll find yourself engrossed with the deep gameplay and crisp visuals. Next time, though, we'd like to see online play, a map editor, tweaked AI, and a refined fighting system.", "date": "Feb 10, 2004"}
