But the hype was diminished a bit, on reflection, when most gamers realized that the last series in that list likely wouldn't hit the VC as soon as the others. The Metal Slug games had already been brought to the Wii, on a physical disc, in the form of Metal Slug Anthology  so SNK wouldn't want to damage any potential sales for that compilation by bringing its individual installments to the VC, right? Seems so, since so far the MS franchise has been totally absent from the Wii Shop.   But while it's unfortunate to not yet have a true Metal Slug experience available for digital download, the Shop has now offered up a capable substitute  Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy. This side-scrolling brawler/shooter is essentially the same design as Metal Slug but with a different name. It's got overly colorful graphics with cartoonish heroes and enemies. It's got fast, explosive action that rarely gives you a moment to rest. And it's got the over-the-top boss encounters that scrolling shooter fans so know and love.   It's really quite a little clone, which is all fine and acceptable since Top Hunter was brought out by the same company as Metal Slug, and around the same era. And it's not a total knock-off, as there are a few unique elements that Top Hunter has all to itself.   Roddy and Cathy take on hoverboard racing in one of the game's bonus stages.  Chief among those unique qualities is this game's dual-planed level design. There's a foreground level that you can run along through, attacking enemies and saving the day as normal  but there's also a background plane that you can leap to at almost any time. Different enemies and obstacles populate the background, and running through it will leave your character occasionally obscured by environmental elements like trees that are ~closer~ to the screen. Succeeding in each level will often come down to managing your time and efforts between both the planes, jumping back and forth as needed to gather power-ups and take out baddies.   Taking out baddies is different from Metal Slug, too, as Top Hunter isn't focused on shooting. You get guns occasionally, sure enough, but your primary weapon is your extendable arm. Like Dhalsim in the Street Fighter series, your hero's arms can stretch out far beyond his or her body to strike foes up ahead. You can also grab enemies and elements of the environment in this way  you'll often see dangling chains hanging overhead that, if you reach up to grab them and pull them down, will effect some change in the level like dropping down a cascade of health-replenishing food.    One thing that Top Hunter absolutely does have in common with Metal Slug is the availability of rideable mechsuits, which show up fairly frequently in each level. Both Roddy and Cathy can jump in and pilot these armored walkers easily, and riding in one will protect you from major damage for a while  the suit's punches are similar to those of the walker you might remember from Mega Man X, and can do considerable harm to your foes. Once the robot takes too much damage, though, it will explode and leave you to have to use your own two feet again.   And last to mention, of course, is the game's two-player co-op mode  with both main characters named and featured in the game's subtitle, you know that you'll be able to team up with a friend to take out enemies together. And the co-op option works well in Top Hunter. With two planes to cover in each level, one of you can take the background while the other focuses on the foreground. Tag-teaming against bosses is particularly helpful, as opposed to going it alone. It's a solid feature and one that's worth nothing if you've been a fan of other two-player simultaneous designs that have hit the Virtual Console in the past.Top Hunter is one of those games that you likely saw once or twice in an old arcade, perhaps installed inside one of those multi-game Neo Geo cabinets, and maybe you gave it a shot before ultimately forgetting about it. That's a fair reaction, but this one may be worth another look. Because while Top Hunter doesn't ever reach the same level of classic addictiveness as the more popular Metal Slug franchise, it does well enough  its dual-plane stage designs and stretch-arm attack mechanics help to set it apart and give it a sense of its own identity. With the Metal Slug series still currently unavailable for digital download on the Wii and set at a pricetag of 40 bucks to own in anthology form, you may be better served to put down nine dollars for this pretty good substitute instead.", "date": "Jan 31, 2008"}
