{"name": "Batman Begins [GBA]", "name_review": "Batman Begins", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/21/batman-begins-2", "text": "Filmmakers may have reset the whole Batman universe with a new take on the dark knight in Batman Begins, but the Game Boy Advance version isn't as unique  as the film it's based on. The game, developed by Vicarious Visions, plays it safe with a solid action design that borrows heavily from previous VV side-scrollers, and just like the console versions of the title, it feels like it's inspired by Ubisoft's own Splinter Cell series for its stealth-like gameplay. It's nothing new, but it's nothing bad, either.   Batman Begins fills in nearly all the gaps in Bruce Wayne's history by telling the straightforward tale on how this billionaire became Gotham City's greatest crimefighter. The Game Boy Advance title takes the films situations and storyline and strings them together within a series of action sequences that's a mix between beat-em-up brawler action, Prince of Persia style exploration, and Splinter Cell-like stealth.   Where the console games went 3D, the Game Boy Advance edition stuck with the strengths of the hardware and went strictly 2D. Much of the gameplay elements have been retained, though; players guide Batman through a variety of dark locations, climbing ladders, ledges, and drainpipes to gain access throughout the areas in order to solve the mystery that's a huge part of the film's plot. Like the film, and with it the console game, the GBA version flashes back to Bruce Wayne's past, used here as a training mission for players to learn not just the game's combat, but how to sneak around without being caught.   The combat is solid but just a little on the loose side, especially when surrounded by a decent amount of bad guys. The development team give a nice assortment of kicks and punches, as well as a handy block feature that protects Batman from the standard attacks from enemies. But contact between Batman's fist and foot to the enemy's body is a little muddied, and stringing together combos seems a little disconnecting since the Batman sprite has a lot of animation frames to play through before it's ready for the next move. He has a very cool reverse attack that punches a bad guy to his rear, but the reach is so short that the bad guy literally has to be humping the hero for this punch to connect. There's also a distinct lack of forgiveness on the game's part after taking a hit by an enemy or harmful object; most games would give players a short burst of invulnerability to distance themselves from something causing Batman harm. But not here. Get trapped in a field of lasers, and you can kiss your bat butt goodbye.   And though the Game Boy Advance game is based heavily on the level and story progression of the console game, one element didn't make it into the GBA's design: the Batmobile. It's a missed opportunity, especially since this awesome vehicle had such a heavy focus in the theatrical film. Not only that, its omission means there's a lack of variety in the overall game presentation; all of the levels in Batman Begins for the GBA are of the same style of level design. Other than the different layouts and enemy locations, it's the same gameplay from start to finish.      There are some cool bits in Batman Begins, like having the ability to snag unaware enemies from the darkness for an easy kill, or being able to call up a flock of bats for protection and a nifty special attack. It's a solid action title with a really great look for the Game Boy Advance, even if the game design doesn't do a whole lot to impress with anything ~new~ for GBA gamers. It is challenging, however, since players are forced all the way back to a particular level after dying. It won't be a quick romp through Batman's first Gotham City adventure, that's for sure.  Batman Begins is easily the best Batman title on the Game Boy Advance, but considering the competition (Batman Vengeance, Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu), that's not all that strong a compliment. The GBA title is a solid one with enough strengths in its design to recommend, as long as you understand that the game doesn't offer a whole lot of ~wow~ factor.", "date": "Jun 21, 2005"}
