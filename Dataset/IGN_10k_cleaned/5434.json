With a brand name so strong -- Reagan-era daddy-complex flyboy fantasies still sell -- many mobile gamers will just instantly react with a quick click on the ~purchase~ link. After all, the first Top Gun shooter was a huge hit --why shouldn't this follow-up be any different?   And you know what, it isn't any different. Not different at all. Sure, there are some different boss battles and some new weapon upgrades, but for the most part, Top Gun II refuses to step outside the same shadow that Maverick's daddy cast over him throughout much of the movie that inspired the game.   At the onset of your mission, you can choose either Maverick or Iceman. Each pilot has slightly differing weapons, but neither really require radical changes in game play style to get the job of clearing the heavens of evil jets done. Iceman is slower with more lethal gun. Thusly, Maverick is faster with less powerful gunnery.   But we'll give you a little hint about speed in Top Gun II. It doesn't matter. The game has a built-in slowdown that evens the score -- at no point are you hard-pressed to avoid gunfire because the game kindly slows down to that newfangled bullet-time to let you avoid the streaming lead. Whoa, indeed.   With wave after endless wave of jump jets and massive bombers to destroy, you must continually upgrade your firepower. When you destroy mid-boss aircraft, they release medals that can be traded in at a store for bigger guns. Every time you buy an upgrade, the next upgrade for that weapon increases by one medal.   The catch here with getting these medals, though, is that you often must put your plane in harm's way to pick them up. You fly ahead to grab a medal floating down the side of the screen -- because, after all, you destroyed the enemy jet as soon as it appeared in the sky -- but suddenly another enemy fighter swoops in from the side and rams your jet. You never had a chance. Maybe you're just better off buying extra fuel, the Top Gun II equivalent of health -- instead of bigger weapons.   Whereas Top Gun II play mechanics may be cookie-cutter, the visuals are not. Mforma's Top Gun II dev team has a real talent with color and sprite design, because Top Gun II really lifts off the screen. It's a game you'll enjoy looking at (~See the pretty colors my high-res screen makes?~) almost as much, if not more, than playing.  If I seem a little harsh on Top Gun II, it's because I like Mforma. And I know that they are capable of doing much more than many of their recent efforts, including this shoot-by-numbers blaster. And even though the game bears the name ~Top Gun,~ it really doesn't have any hooks to the movie beyond the use of the Maverick and Iceman call signs, as well as some jets.However, if you are a shooter fan and don't mind some slowdown -- and by now, what shooter fan isn't used to some chugging? -- then you are apt to get an hour or so of thrills out of Top Gun II. It is a pretty game and the weapon upgrade system does work a little towards offsetting the basic shooting game play.Should Mforma tackle a Top Gun III, though, I just hope they make a real effort to changing this up a bit, as well as ditching the slowdown. Perhaps the gen of handsets due in 2005 will offer Mforma the kind of horsepower they can really get creative with. Because trust me, they have the talent.", "date": "Jan 13, 2005"}
