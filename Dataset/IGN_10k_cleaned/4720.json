{"name": "River City Ransom EX", "name_review": "River City Ransom EX", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/26/river-city-ransom-ex-2", "text": "As far as brawling games go, nobody can touch the masterful work of the now-defunct Technos -- between arcade games like WWF Wrestlemania to home and handheld editions of hits like Double Dragon, even the Segas and Capcoms of the world still cower when the Technos fist is flexed. And out of Technos' impressive series of classics, one stands out as the pinnacle of their efforts: the 1989 NES game River City Ransom (known in Japan as Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari or Street Gangs in the UK.) With its combination of inventive and sprite physics-based fighting gameplay, and its engrossing RPG-like character building system, this was a beat-em-up for the ages.  It's taken some time, but at last, River City Ransom has come back. And it's back with a vengeance.  Features  Classic NES-style gameplay with all-new moves Buy hundreds of items from stores to increase fighting power Complex stat-tracking with battery back-up File trading options for system link-up.   If you think I'm speaking hyperbole and rhetoric with that opening statement, you probably have never played the River City Ransom NES original. It's the kind of game that inspires fans like the Mayor of Rad City's Seanbaby to create a RCR fansite. It's one of the games that helped spawn the MOD and EMU scene. For a beat-em-up, this game is more than memorable -- success eluded this game when it first hit the market 15 years ago, but it has been chasing after RCR ever since to correct that oversight. After Atlus brought the Technos team (now called Million) back to the world of gaming with  Super Dodge Ball Advance , the company received a flood of requests demanding that River City be next. Any way, any how ... any little bit of that classic would do.  Atlus saw fit to meet the demand with a remade update on the NES original for the Game Boy Advance -- River City Ransom EX is not the visually-stunning redux that could have been possible on GBA, and is also not the full-out sequel that some still dare to dream about, but it is an improved version of the game many of you fell in love with. And despite being a sparse as far as modern features and presentation, Atlus allowed the developers to explore to their heart's desire the founding basis of this great game: the gameplay.     Developer Millions went absolutely bananas with the gameplay additions to River City Ransom -- there are so many moves in this game, you may find yourself discovering new techniques months after purchasing. We had the preview build for a month before playing the review copy, and still were surprised when we pulled off the jumping uppercut (reading the manual, of course, takes away some of the surprise, but who does that?) Mashing buttons produces different results from more technical block and attacking methods. New weapons are also added to the fold -- most are just cosmetic changes, but they're all good fun to play around with using the game's sprite physics system. The addition of computerized co-op was genius as well -- although I could have ripped my digital partner's head off for accidentally knocking me out with a stray thrown weapon, the game is a lot more fun with him around than not (oddly, however, the link cable multiplayer was cut.) And even with a number of combos and counters added to the gameplay, the developers haven't pushed the game too far, as they did Super Dodge Ball Advance -- the difficulty balance is rarely thrown wildly off by a change or addition, and tough street thugs can still put up a good fight if need be.   Also added are a few new moves to buy from the game's many shops, which keeps your approach to the gameplay changing up as you continue to add to your battery-saved character file. This RPG-inspired aspect of the game -- where the coins you nab from beat-up foes -- is the other half of the appeal to this classic, and all of the stores have had their stocks beefed up with new items to buy and try. Some of the choices made in designing this part of the game may not be so welcome to fans -- prices are higher (likely to account for the easier stat-saving with the GBA battery), and a great many of the items don't seem to meet their value (stick with the $10 and $20 items from everywhere except the Book shops and the Shoe store until you're set enough to freely toss cash around.) There's not even a Free Smile in the game now -- everything's got a price. But the number of boss battles available is significant, and the inclusion of a gang of rich wussies (catch 'em quick!) helps to balance out the change and give you something fun to do rather than wail on the same set of easy punks over and over as in the NES game.  With all this concentration on amping up the gameplay, however, Million seems to have let other aspects go fallow -- particularly, the woefully outdated presentation. Where it concerns gameplay, they put in effort -- there's a gigantic Smash Bros-style stat system that tracks your every move, and while the one-word Japanglish fails to explain most toggles, there are all kinds of settings for adjusting difficulty and play control. Yet, the very simplest areas of presentation are outdated, and sometimes dysfunctional. The game's save system, for instance, is just about broken. There's no auto-save system, and saving to the cart creates a ghost save instead of re-writing an old one -- log enough ghost saves, and you'll have to go in and delete old ones to be able to save your current progress. (And, just as with the NES password, a save file still dumps you off at the beginning of the game as if you haven't played the thing 500 times before.) Multiplayer has been dropped at the last minute -- now, it's just file trading. There are no cut-scenes added to the game to tell the otherwise-inscrutable story (a shame after the attractive character renders in Super Dodge Ball Advance), and the game still starts off with just a pointless text intro and that a tacky ransom-sprawl title (there's also now a data exchanging/editing menu, which is equally out-of-place.) Unless Atlus really invests in the franchise, this is probably the best bet for a revival that RCR will get, but the potential to reach out to a new audience is squandered. It's faithful to the NES game, but faithful to a fault.    The overall package that is River City Ransom points towards a significant, if unsettling, change in the gaming biz: gameplay is still king, but it cannot rule alone. Back 15 years ago when this game first rocked NES players, it didn't need to make sense or go anywhere -- its fist-pounding, high-flying action gameplay was enough to even get people past the goofy original box art. But now, the stakes have been raised -- even on the little GBA, we expect a certain degree of polish, a certain degree of game length, and even a certain degree of Hollywood-style story or cinematic immersion.If you can get past that, this game rocks. I'm still going to go ahead and say that River City Ransom EX is one of the few kick-ass, must-own, constantly-on-hand games in my collection for GBA -- there are so few games of this caliber on the handheld that match action with depth that, even with its faults, it's very needed. Some gameplay changes are odd choices for fans (jump-kicks aren't as responsive now because of an added special move available when jumping, and the Acro Circus technique is just about ruined), and even newbies willing to look past the spare presentation will still yearn for an unlockable bonus stages, multiplayer battlegrounds or something to pad out this relatively short title, but it's otherwise a good, constant brawl. I've been constantly enraptured by the gameplay in this cart, as have those that I've lent the game to, both fans and first-time RCR'ers. It's an uncomfortable fit on GBA because it's just too empty in presentation to exist all these years later as just this -- things might almost have been better if Atlus had instead released the original intact as part of Nintendo's NES Classics series and instead concentrated Million's efforts on a sequel. Hopefully, all of you will go out and buy this sucker to encourage Atlus to do just that.", "date": "May 26, 2004"}
