The player AI always drops the ball. Blame it on the tiny power of this aging 8-bit system if you must, but that still never forgives bad gameplay. Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout somehow runs past that problem. In general, it really does play like soccer.   So why are we crying over this girl? Because the refs are too stupid to let Mia and her teammates play a fair half.   Features:  Fast-paced international soccer Full players rosters Two quick-switching playable views of the field Battery back-up for Season play Only for Game Boy Color   Featuring US National Soccer Team player and Olympic gold medallist Mia Hamm, Southpeak's soccer title is the first to cater to female gamers. Not that girl players are clamoring for their own representation in the videogame version of the sport, since soccer on the whole is still battling to crack the majors in America, but with women's soccer sweeping up some viewers in the Olympics and with the US team taking the World Cup against nations that breed children specifically for footie heroes, it is about time for this game.  And in that effort, Aqua Pacific has a fast-paced barnburner of a soccer game. Gameplay is simple but straight-forward and easy to get into. You pass with one button, shoot with another, and that's it; defensively, all you can do is steal. Fancy tricks like headers and bicycle kicks are left out, and the fact that the ball never leaves the field's floor is disappointing (since soccer is a sport where the challenge is in gaining control of an unwieldy ball that's never fully contained while running at rushing speeds), but it's enough for a portable soccer game just to stay in motion.   This straightforward gameplay is just in the front end, as actual gameplay has a nice set of advanced options for more involved players. Full rosters of ranked players are included for those who know the sport well enough to know who to sub in and out (though, since the game doesn't track injuries, this rarely makes a difference outside the starting line-up). Formations can be set and assigned for different styles of play -- playing against a heavy offensive team may be best combated by bringing your team back more and trusting a few forwards to make the big plays. Sometimes the computer neglects to make plays while the sides are resetting themselves, but other than that, it's pretty neat to see the defense recompose on break-aways to keep the shooter out of the center.   So far, so good. It's a well-playing game of soccer, with the options for pros. What's the problem? Maybe it's that you can slide-tackle the goalie and score without a penalty. Or that you can pass off-sides to your heart's content without a penalty. Or that you can viciously knock down a player from behind without a penalty. Noticing a pattern? Heck, these refs are so stupid, the only time they do call a penalty is on defensive obstruction -- you can hammer a player until their teeth are filled with grass, but try to stop a play and make a mistake, and the whistle blows for a free kick... sometimes inches away from the goal.   With no penalties, you're free to man-handle the opposition. Yellow cards and injuries don't exist, so that negates the purpose of offering rosters when the starting line-up is the best you're going to get. And since the ref calls on the defense more than the offense, the computer doesn't stand a chance even playing on Hard mode. Adding more insult for your onslaught, the passing engine further negates a good defense. Passes sail through throngs of defenders straight to the receiver, so without threat of getting picked off, you can get the ball in scoring range without really even playing.   Plagued AI is just a general problem in this game -- the players do fine on the field, so long as the gamer doesn't take advantage of the blind refs and loot the ball, but get down in the goal box and suddenly everything goes haywire. On offense, the goalie always leaps the most illogical way to make the save -- if you approach from the corner, the goalie will always leap away from the goal, as if trying to stop an intentional goal kick instead of a shot. And on defense, the computer forwards actually make that completely ridiculous play of kicking the ball outside of the goal for a goal kick and turn-over. Even on a breakaway, they'll throw it away when all is theirs.  Mia Hamm could have been a sharp score on the Game Boy Color. Graphically, it moves nice and quick, with sharp characters and two views of the field that switch instantly. You don't even have to look that closely to see that they're girls. But bad, rushed programming keeps these girls from becoming women's champs. When it gets to the point that you can just walk into the goal while dribbling the ball and score, it becomes obvious that the computer isn't playing to win. If at least there were Link Play, there might be a challenge here, but again, that option has been rushed out of the final product. Mia doesn't make the finals at all. Stick around instead for Nintendo's Pocket Soccer to see a real championship game.", "date": "Nov 11, 2000"}
