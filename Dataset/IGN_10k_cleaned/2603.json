{"name": "The Sims: Vacation", "name_review": "The Sims: Vacation", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/08/the-sims-vacation", "text": "I remember when Myst used to dominate the sales charts. Its initial success was understandable, because its graphics were good for its time and it was one of the first games to ever come out on CD-ROM. But as time went on, as the whole industry shifted to CDs, Myst remained the number one selling computer game month after month, year after year, in defiance of all logic and common sense. This used to make me quite angry, because beneath all its gaudy makeup, it was still just another crappy adventure game with a piss-poor game mechanic and such a monumentally turgid design that it actually expected players to solve combination locks in order to advance to the next pre-rendered screen. What next...I should fill out some tax forms for you too? Thank goodness graphic adventures are nearly dead. In my view, those things weren't even games.  So if any game was going to dethrone Myst as the best-selling PC game of all time, I'm glad it was The Sims, which in many ways is the anti-Myst. Graphic adventures are linear to a fault: about as interactive as watching a videotape and occasionally hitting ~pause~ and ~play~ with a couple of crossword puzzles thrown in for good measure. The Sims, on the other hand, is about as open-ended and liberating a game as I've seen since (and I'll date myself here) Stuart Smith's Adventure Construction Set. Myst demanded nothing from the player but masochistic patience. The Sims doesn't demand anything either, but the more you put into it, the more it gives back. It's a tantalizing software tablet, a challenge to your storytelling abilities, a Rorschach test in brightly-colored sprites.  What do you do with Myst after you beat it? Play it again? See if you can twist those knobs a little faster? The Sims never really ends. It's an open-ended experience, with no levels to complete, no missions to accomplish, no artificial notions of ~winning~ and ~losing~ imposed by some brain-dead game designer mindlessly recapitulating what he remembers from Super Mario Brothers or Doom. It's a game that nurtures creativity and rewards tinkerers...in fact it's more than just a game, it's a hobby, a box full of toys, and even if you never make an object or paint a skin yourself, you can always play with the other toys created for it by its wonderful community.  Myself, I think The Sims is far and away the single most creative game released in many, many years, and it's good to know that so many of you out there agree. That's why the game has become a runaway bestseller, ensuring that we'll be managing our Little Computer People in sequels and online versions and more expansion packs for many years to come.  And now, after that effervescent praise and strident editorial, I'm sure we're all ready for a little vacation...  How do you expand The Sims?  Since The Sims was such a solid, standalone game, you get the feeling its designers were initially stymied when trying to come up with something to put into an expansion pack. So not too surprisingly, the first expansion, Living Large mostly added a bunch of stuff to the existing game. Granted it was really, really good stuff, much better than most user-created graphics and objects, but there really wasn't much in there you couldn't download or design on your own.  The second expansion, House Party actually opened your Sims' houses up a bit so that more than a handful of people could visit at a time. Players were finding more things to do with their Sims than just make them eat, sleep, and pee. Slowly, the game was broadening its horizons.  Then along came Hot Date, and while it was marketed on its ~sex appeal~ (as if that makes any sense when you're talking about bitmapped sprites), its real strength was letting your Sims actually leave their houses. It's as if some virtual Pied Piper marched through SimCity, shouting, ~Freedom!~ and leading all of the Sims out of their suburbs and into the downtown...or at least the mini-malls. And there was much rejoicing.   Hot Date also added many new social interactions, custom clothing types, non-neighborhood NPCs, and -- belatedly -- a rudimentary NPC editor of sorts. And while it had its problems, it was easily the most significant and exciting Sims release since the original.  All that brings us to today, and Sims Vacation, the fourth expansion in the series. The good news is that Vacation is as deep and feature-rich as Hot Date. But that's also the bad news -- Vacation never takes any step beyond Hot Date. It's pretty much just more of the same.   Still, that's not a bad thing.   Let's take a vacation.  As with Hot Date, Vacation adds nine new lots to every neighborhood. And like Hot Date, you send your Sims off by having them pick up a phone and call for a taxi. There are a couple caveats, though. Your entire family has to go on the trip, so no one can be at work or school when you make the call. This makes vacation management something of a chore for large families. Alternately you can select one Sim and have them invite a non-family member on vacation. In that case, the invited Sim will kind of trail around half-heartedly after the Sim you control, randomly complaining about food, hygiene and other personal problems. Still, this can be easier to manage than controlling a huge family, and it plays like Hot Date, in that you control the one Sim, and use that one Sim to try to keep the other one happy.      It's nice that you can actually take your kids along on the Vacation too, but that's kind of offset by the fact that you can't easily split your family up for vacations. This is probably an engine limitation -- if you sent some family members on vacation, then went back to that house and sent other members downtown, and then invited still others to a neighbor's house, the game would probably get very confused indeed.  So you've got the trip sorted out, and your vacationers are ready to go. What happens next? Unfortunately there's nothing so dramatic as an airport or customs line -- rather a tacky SUV pulls up and takes your family off, the game saves, and then you're switched to the Vacation Island destination selection screen, just like in Hot Date, the only difference being you're choosing from nine different resorts, rather than nine different downtown lots.  Give the designers some credit for using three different tilesets, though. There are snowy alpine retreats, tropical beach paradises, and some good old-fashioned forested campgrounds. The game pretends these different climates are all on the same magical Vacation Island, but that doesn't really make any difference. It doesn't cost anything to travel from lot to lot either, and it doesn't make any difference how long you stay down there on Vacation Island, since your Sims will always be able to go back to their jobs without any penalty whatsoever. Time isn't really an issue for Sims in this case, and in fact the only penalty you'll suffer for leaving Sims on vacation for months and months at a time is that their relationships will gradually deteriorate over time (though that can be offset by buying postcards in the gift shop).  We're here, now what?  Once your Sims arrive at a resort, they'll immediately start wandering off and amusing themselves (unless you turn free will off, which is probably a good idea with large groups). And sure enough, Vacation is loaded with a couple dozen cool new objects for them to interact with and use. There are all kinds of county fair type gimmicks, like strength-testers and water balloon races, which they can use by themselves or in groups. Some of these items look like they've been thrown together pretty quickly, simple clones of earlier devices but with new graphics, while others definitely had some time put into them. Of these, the best is the volleyball net. Lots of Sims can get together and play, and it has the most new animations associated with it. It's also entertaining for you as the player to watch them play volleyball, whereas watching them shoot arrows or toss darts gets old fast, since the results seem to be purely random.  That's an important point: it is possible to get bored with the Sims if they're not doing anything new, unpredictable, or exciting. A big part of the game's fun is getting these little simulated people into strange situations and finding out what happens. But too many of the Vacation Island recreational activities are just variations of the pinball machine.  Which brings up another interesting point...Sims have a physical skill rating, so why doesn't the game use it? Sims with high physical skills, especially those in the Pro Athlete career track, ought to be great at the strength-tester and at volleyball, but the game doesn't seem to care at all. I realize The Sims isn't an RPG, but it could learn a lot from role-playing games in terms of skill development and application of those skills to game-world problems. Every time an expansion pack adds a bunch of objects like snowboarding and volleyball, there should be a skill for it, based off the physical rating perhaps, but specific to that sport and which can be improved with time.  It's kind of a shame that more RPG knowledge hasn't been brought to bear here, since that's one area where The Sims is a bit weak. Sure, it's more than offset by the fact that The Sims has absolutely the most elegant, sophisticated character-to-character social interactions of any single-player game ever, but there's always room for improvement.  And finally, some of these resort island activities are kind of strange. Who on Earth goes to a ski resort and uses a metal detector to look for lost change? That's crazy. The snowboarding bank is neat, and it's fun to watch, but why isn't there an actual ski run? I realize a ski mountain would be too big for the tiny lots these resorts are built on, but they could show them on the top of the run, and then returning on the lift exhausted but happy, or whatever. And it's hard picture a beach vacation without any surfing, boogie-boarding, shell-gathering, driftwood-collecting, lifeguard-chatting, or whale-watching.   Let's hope that the user community will step up and ~fill in the gaps~ as they have before.    Souvenirs, we got souvenirs.   All right, so the activities your Sims engage in are a little limited. Well, let's not mince words. They're boring. They're boring to watch and they're probably boring for your Sims too. I mean, send me on a vacation and I got better ways to spend money than chucking darts at six bucks a pop. What's a Sim to do?  One interesting thing the designers have done here is incorporate a whole prize ticket/souvenir game-within-a-game thing. This is kind of neat. What it means is, if your character beats enough of the carnival games, they'll get enough tickets to redeem for one of the souvenirs at the gift shop -- a crystal skull, a coconut monkey, or what not. Along the same lines, if your Sim is out fishing or metal-detecting, there's a chance they might pull up an interesting item they think is worth keeping.  This stuff carries over when they get home too, since there are now several new objects (shelves and fireplaces mostly) that let you display small, handheld items like souvenirs in your home. Furthermore, you can then direct a Sim to take a look at one of these items when they're in their living room, and they'll reminisce about their vacation...a little bit. Mainly they'll remember if they had fun or not.  All this is fine and good, but I don't think it's going to appeal to every player. In fairness to the designers, simply because of the nature of a game like The Sims, you're not going to please all the players all the time. I am sure there are many players out there who think souvenir-hunting is the greatest thing since the Extreme Sports career track. These are probably the same kind of players who are desperately trying to ~win~ the game by having their Sim at the very top of their career track, in as rich and expensive a house as possible, owning every single item in the game.  But not everyone plays like that. I know I don't. If you look around my neighborhood, you'll find a bunch of deadbeats, hoodlums, slobs, grifters and hippies. To me, the Sims is more about storytelling and situational comedy, and unfortunately bad carnival games, crummy prize tickets, and ugly souvenirs don't do much in that regard.  Oh won't somebody please think of the children!  So if I'm not into collecting tickets and souvenirs and don't care about ~winning~ the archery contest, what's in it for me? Hot Date added a huge number of clever social interactions that really made the game fun again, and Vacation, while not quite as extensive in that regard, does the same. There are new social interactions here, most of which are geared towards the kids.  That's a good thing. Kids have been kind of shortchanged in all of the expansion packs up to now, and in fact I found kids to be so ultimately boring that most of the houses in my current neighborhood don't have any kids at all. But Vacation gives them a bunch of new ways to interact with each other and adults -- they'll do handstands, they'll play rock-paper-scissors, they'll fuss and cry and cause all kinds of problems.  There's nothing radical in these new behaviors, though. Kids still act as mini-adults without any sort of deep and meaningful ties to anyone else, when you might think that it would be fairly easy for the game to track who their parents and siblings were, for example.  It's also disappointing to realize that now, more than two years after the game's been out, there's still no way for kids to grow up into teenagers, and for these (hypothetical) teenagers to turn into adults. Grade school, soccer teams, Cub Scouts, birthday parties, kids' ~job tracks~ (jock, nerd, bully, soc), and hobbies like skateboarding, comic books, bug and stamp collections, dollhouses, whatever, are all still terra incognita for the game, too.  Eat, drink, and be merry.  Probably the biggest difference between Vacation and Hot Date is that your Sims can actually sleep on Vacation Island, whereas they couldn't downtown -- they'd just get really, really tired, but never actually pass out. That's a major improvement -- I think one of the biggest complaints I had and I know a lot of other users had was that it was impossible to use beds downtown, to create hotels or camps for the homeless or army bases or whatever bizarre public space you wanted to do. So accommodations have improved.  When it comes to clothes, Vacation adds one more custom clothes type to the mix, the winter wear. This is a nice addition, since it doesn't make much sense for your Sim to wear a swimsuit in the snow (and in fact if you try, your Sim will suffer), but again this is something that was already done in Hot Date, which added custom swimsuits, formal wear, and pajamas for each Sim. Now that was a great feature (anything that lets you customize and personalize the appearance or behavior of a given Sim, to help distinguish him or her from its myriad neighbors, is a great feature), but I would've wished Vacation to take the next, obvious step -- to make all clothes buyable and tied to a given Sim. So for example, one Sim just couldn't wear any clothes in your skins directory that matched their gender and skin tone, that they'd actually have to go downtown and buy it to add to their wardrobe. But that's probably asking way too much of the engine. Hopefully it's something they'll put in Sims 2.  Another nuisance in Vacation is the lack of privacy. I don't know about you, but when I go on vacation, I don't expect the neighbors to simply walk into my bathroom, and I certainly don't expect costumed mascots to do the same thing -- but then again, I haven't been to Disneyland in a while.  But this really shouldn't be an issue. The game does know how to decide what tiles or portals are off-limits to certain characters -- strangers can't come into your Sims' home unless you greet them or you've thrown a party, and the Hot Date pack introduced gender-specific doors for bathrooms. Things like ~Key to Room 1~ given to every member of your family on check-in seems doable. It's not the biggest problem by any means, but it could've been addressed.    If you build it, they will come.  As with Hot Date, if you don't like how any of the vacation resorts are designed, you can knock 'em down and build your own. That's great, but one big problem I have with this feature -- the same problem I had with it in Hot Date -- is that every object in your Sims directory isn't readily available for the downtown or resort build modes. Why is that? Why is there some sort of artificial limitation being put on players' creativity in this regard? Granted there are player-created utilities (and, belatedly, even a Maxis one) that let you get around these unfair restrictions, but they're not 100% reliable, particularly right after a new expansion pack comes out.  And along those same lines, the NPCs that come with your resorts are infuriatingly hard-coded into place. This makes trying to do something like create a desert island with no amenities or luxuries somewhat impractical. One of the first things I did when I got Vacation was knock down one of the beach resorts and try to create ~Survivor Island,~ which had a grill and a telephone and that's about it. However when I sent Tony Soprano to try his luck roughing it, I was surprised to find Cruise Director Stacy and Janitor Sonya or whatever their names are walking around like they owned the place.  And that's a problem, and not just on Survivor-style homemade islands, too. Those NPCs never stop walking around, they never leave their posts, they never go on break, they never shut down for the night. Not only does that suck in terms of busting up the illusion of a fictional world, but it can also become a performance issue when you have all your own Sims safely sleeping and you're running the game on high speed, and all these damn Vacation Island workers are running around like crank freaks all night long. You had this problem in Hot Date too but since you couldn't spend the night downtown, not really, it wasn't such an issue ... but here, it's painfully obvious.  Another thing I didn't like about Hot Date that carries over into Vacation is that you can't interact with the NPCs who sell the hot dogs or serve the drinks. Why shouldn't those people have relationships, personality points, interests and all the rest of it? It wasn't so bad in The Sims when the pizza guy or the cop showed up, they were only there for a brief period of time. But in Vacation, your Sims are spending a lot of time in that place, so it's quite possible they're going to interact with the staff on more than just a professional level. But as it is, the worker NPCs might as well be robots...although there's no easy way to go in and change their skins and names to make them look that way (so much for my Mars Vacation resort idea, sorry Ahnold...). Shouldn't each expansion pack make it easier, not harder, for the players to customize their simulated software worlds?  Non-playable characters.  Speaking of NPCs, it's worth noting that there are a lot of NPCs you can interact with, both single people and whole families are randomly generated by the program each time a new resort island is installed in a new neighborhood. These people are much more interesting to interact with than the workers, for obvious reasons, and what's nice is that even after you go home, your new friends will show up on your Sims' telephone call list.  One bizarre feature that they all share though is that their last names are pulled off a list of Famous Authors. Now I'm not one to knock literature, my roommates were ready to throw all my books in the sea after our recent move since I have so many of the damn things, but I think using author names this way is lazy and sloppy. It's a distraction. Camus? Twain? C'mon. Every single sports game I own does a better job generating random, believable names for new characters than The Sims does. Granted, this is better than calling everyone ~Townie~ like Hot Date did, but geez, at least attempt a little verisimilitude. Or give us a text file to edit.  What did you think of The Sims: Vacation?  Fortunately the ~Hot Date Creator~ -- a free utility released on the Sims website a little while back -- allows you to replace these badly-named duds with your own characters. This is something you should do in any case, since the game also uses random skins for the Vacation Island NPCs, and if your skins directory is anything like my skins directory, it's filled with hundreds of bizarre, ugly, useless, and otherwise inappropriate skins. Nothing ruins a vacation faster than meeting some crazy guy named Bob Twain dressed like Darth Vader who gets a little too friendly on the archery range.  The End. I suppose this review has been rather longer than most people can be bothered to read, so if you made it this far, good for you. I guess the bottom line is this -- everything I loved and appreciated about Hot Date I love and appreciate in Vacation. I love being able to have Sims leave the house, go somewhere else, meet new people, buy new things, and have new things to do. But by the same token, the things that annoyed me about Hot Date -- fixed behavior and appearances for the worker NPCs, no death or danger or passing out, limited access to your object collection in build mode -- annoys the heck out of me here too.But probably the biggest disappointment I have with Vacation is that it only does what Hot Date did and no more -- there's no quantum step forward in terms of interaction or exploration. There's no school or workplace. There's no SimCity street to walk down and get mugged on. There's no new skills, no new interests, no new job tracks, no duties, no dangers, no excitement, nothing more serious than a bad flu. Heck, there's not even a slide projector for your Sims to show off their lousy vacation pics to their bored neighbors.All my complaints though, I know, could be addressed were Electronic Arts willing to actually invest in Maxis and give them the resources and the time to expand the line, instead of canceling Sims games and laying people off. How ironic is that? The Sims -- a game the EA didn't even want to release -- has made more money for the company than most of the rest of their fare?So Vacation is still a must for any serious Sims fan, and you'll end up having fun with it. I know I did. Still, I can only hope that future expansion packs and sequels get away from the tongue-in-cheek parodying of materialist society and back to the business of the entertaining simulation of a broad-range of human behavior, with as much power in the users' hands as the engine can possibly allow.That, after all, is why we're playing The Sims and not Myst.", "date": "Apr 8, 2002"}
