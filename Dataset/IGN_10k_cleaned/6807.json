The ultimate dilemma, though, rises when a full-priced game packs similar content to something you can score for under a dollar. That's the conundrum with Go! Sudoku, from developer Sumo Digital. On the one hand, it includes a wealth of challenging puzzles; while on the other hand, these puzzles aren't much different from what you'd find in a local newspaper.   Sudoku, for those who may not know, is a game of logic where you need to assign numbers on a grid made up of 91 squares. You can only choose the numbers one through nine and the goal is to form squares, rows and columns without any overlapping numbers. It sounds simple, and it can be, but it can also provide a brain-melting test of your logic abilities. It's a fun, rewarding game, both on paper and in digital form. Of course, the nature of the PSP allows for bonuses like wireless multiplayer and downloadable puzzles, so it's not as though you're paying for exactly the same experience.   But then there's the other difference. The one that's approximately 30 US dollars, depending on your retailer of choice. So, for fans of Sudoku puzzles, the question switches from 'do I want this game' to 'do I need this game'. And considering what's available free of cost (or close to it), the matter gets a little complicated. Even with the extras mentioned above, certain players may want to stick with traditional Sudoku. It's hard to resist a free treat, after all. For major fans, though, or for those tired of Lumines, there's plenty to like here.   This includes some 1,000 puzzles ranging in difficulty from easy and mild to difficult and fiendish. The game includes far more of the simpler puzzles than the harder ones, but there's a good chance fans won't complain too much about it - this game can get devilishly complex even on the mild to difficult setting. It's not just the design of the puzzle that gets harder, but it's also the time limit. You only get a certain amount for each puzzle, say five minutes. Making matters even more complex is the fact you can only screw up so many times before you start losing life, in the form of a finite number of hearts. Losing life in Sudoku adversely effects your time, and the number of hearts available differs depending on difficulty.    Like most PSP titles, you can challenge friends and neighbors to wireless matches. Perhaps the biggest mode, Battle, lets you compete against two to four other players on the same puzzle grid. The objective is to form as many cells as possible. What makes it interesting is that for every time you screw up, you get locked out of the game for a few seconds, cramping your style. Then there's Versus, where two to four players compete to finish the same puzzle first. You can actually see the percentage of your opponent's puzzle, too, so it's easy to see when your ass is being handed to you, or vice versa. Finally, the game supports limited game sharing. You can transmit five levels of the game to another PSP. It's not bad, but it would have been far cooler to send over dozens.      In terms of presentation, Go! Sudoku does a pretty good job. It's no Lumines, mind you, but it still does a fine job of offering impressive tunes and some nice visuals. You can choose a number of different themes for each puzzle, including Earth, Air and Water, plus you can also customize your own background with photos.   The game includes a number of ambient tracks that match perfectly with the game - they sound great and help you concentrate. And the sound effects, while simple and decidedly barebones, come off as equally pleasing to the ears.   Those looking for a mind-bendingly different take on Sudoku probably won't find it here. And Go! Sudoku may cost a little too much for casual fans. But for those tired of Lumines it packs enough content to warrant a look. The wireless multiplayer options elevate it above its pen-and-paper siblings, and so does its music and visual presentation. Throw in 1,000 included challenges and downloadable puzzles and what you get is one decent little package.", "date": "Apr 6, 2006"}
