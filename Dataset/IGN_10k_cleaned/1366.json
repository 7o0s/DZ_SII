{"name": "Herc's Adventures", "name_review": "Herc's Adventures", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/18/hercs-adventures", "text": "LucasArts decided a break from its Star Wars projects and make a cutesie animated platformer filled with greek mythology and funny animations.   Staged in ancient Greece, three heroes venture out to save Persephone, the goddess of fertility, from the evil clutches of Hades, the god of the undead. Sound cool? Suprisingly, it is.  Graphically, this sprite-based game doesn't exceed any boundaries. It does, however, possess some hilarious animation, including scenes of characters blasting off the screen by catapult and giants throwing sheep and other animals. Believe me, it's funny.  The gameplay has positive notes as well. All the characters move smoothly,  and have different characteristics which help in some instances and hurt in others. For example, Herc is super-strong, and can kill foes in one blow, but he's slow, making him vulnerable to fast enemies that tend to hit and run.  Although Herc's Adventures isn't a super-death-polygon fighter or a high-speed racing sim, all in all, it doesn't look that bad and offers some exciting gameplay. A small, but fine, production from LucasArts.", "date": "Jul 18, 1997"}
