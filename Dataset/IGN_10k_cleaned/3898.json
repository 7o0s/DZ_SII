Bizarrely, the original CyRace actually did a fair bit business, so the inevitable sequel was released -- called CyRace 2. Perhaps the year or two between the racers has been good to Cybiko.  Features: Unlockable track and car General appearance of a racing game Does not burn toast or make you stub your toe  CyRace 2 ranks up there with Charlie's Angels 2 as more of more unessential sequels of 2003. We've spoken with a fair share of handset gamers, and never encountered a single person who was clamoring for more CyRace action.  Probably because there is no such thing as CyRace action.  There is only shoddy controls, boring graphics, and non-existent sound -- but a fairly decent color palette. We take what we can get.  CyRace 2 offers a few game modes for those braved and bored enough to wade into it. Time Trial lets you race for best lap times. Exhibition is a basic race, but should you win, you unlock a hidden car (there are four total). Elimination is a series of races where the last place finisher is, well, eliminated from the competition. Should you triumph over Elimination, you earn a bonus track.  Good luck, bubba.  Racing is just okay, thanks to a basic control scheme. You accelerate by pressing ~2~ and steer by pressing ~4~ and ~6.~ Not that you need to lay on the gas to get place. Just press ~2~ long enough to get going, then worry only about the steering bit for the rest of the race. Simplicity is sometimes best with handset games, but that's ridiculous. It makes the game far too easy to complete.  The tracks themselves are pure Out Run rips. The track curves and turns, rises and falls, just like Yu Suzuki's classic. That's called an homage in film, it's called blatant lifting in vids. The backgrounds and colors change, depending on which track you choose -- but honestly, they all blend together. CyRace 2 isn't nearly as bad as its predecessor, not by a mile. But it is unnecessary, as there are already several racing games that control and run just like it. And a few of them are a little bit better than this. Your best bet for celly racing is still Sorrent's FOX Sports Racing, but if you abolsutely must own the complete collection of Cybiko cell games, here's your next purchase.", "date": "Sep 10, 2003"}
