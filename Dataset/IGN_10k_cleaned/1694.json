Maybe it wasn't on the same lofty level of Grand Prix Legends or the Dreamcast's Ferrari F355, but nonetheless, the lap times were realistic, the setups actually affected the car's drivability, and there was ~feel~ to driving a car.  By this I mean that once your brain learned to recognize the warning signs of a car exceeding its performance envelope, you could learn to take corrective measures before it was too late. But the F1 2000 game had two major strikes against it.  It needed very fast hardware to run decently and it had terrible AI. Another minor problem surfaced once I went online. The lag and warping experienced on my DSL modem was more than frustrating.  Now we advance to F1CS2K, and EA has recognized that their AI from the first version stinks.  Much attention has been given to the AI aspect of the game and we now have a single player game that is worth racing.  That's not to say I have no criticisms of the AI, but it now ranks high enough to be worth racing alone.  I spent a fair amount of time in Catalunya, getting back up to speed and then dicing with AI cars.  I was pleased to see that the physics model has not been compromised, and with all aids off, it's a handful to drive.  Add to that the pressure of fighting with AI cars and the fun truly begins.  If I would dive inside of an AI car coming into a turn, he would generally leave me room on the outside, sometimes fighting back, sometimes not.    A slider in the game's configuration screen lets you set both AI speed as a percentage and AI aggression as a percentage, so you can tinker with these to get the kind of personality and speed that you want from your computerized opponents.  While I've seen AI difficulty specified as a percentage overall, I've not seen aggression used as a setting, and it's a very welcome one.  If the AI does seem obnoxious to the point of being unrealistic then you can tone them down.  If AI cars never seem to even TRY to capitalize on your errors or force a pass, you can make them a bit more daring.  What more could you ask for?  The game is highly customizable in many other ways. Driver assists make the game playable for even those who don't have a keen sensitivity to a car that 'talks' to them.  Opposite lock help, wheelspin help, braking help, steering help and other aids are all independently tweakable.  Some of the features added in a patch to the F1 2000 game are now fully integrated with the title, including the ability to fine tune the controls you're using.  This is very valuable.  You can use X, Y, Z, and RX, RY, RZ axes and map them to driving functions.  You can then set their sensitivity and dead zones as a percentage.  Because you can customize for each axis, you can now do things like make the brake less sensitive and the gas more sensitive, depending upon your driving style.  In fact, I found that in many cases, it was not the car's setup that was killing me, but the control sensitivities.  For an example, I recently got a Thrustmaster NASCAR Pro Digital 2 wheel to test, and it only turns 90 degrees.  I found that I could not drive the setups I'd used with the previous version (which are compatible with the new version).  Every time I'd try to get out of a slow turn I'd spin the car.  Too much throttle?  Too much wheel lock?  I was lost.  Turning the sensitivities way down helped a great deal.  With that, I could be more aggressive and not pay the ultimate price of a quick burnout.  The other major problem with the first version, as I mentioned, was the steep hardware requirements.  After booting the game up in my original setup of a P750 and a GeForce SDR, I threw up my hands and went out and bought a GeForce2 Pro with 64MB of DDR Memory.  This helped a lot, but even that could not allow me to max everything out.  Compromises still need to be made. I've seen some improvement as well, but nothing I could really pin down.  I'll give EA the benefit of a doubt and agree they improved the graphics engine. You'll end up making many of the same cutbacks in graphics you made in the first one, and maybe get a few more frames per second than you did in the last one.  Of course, the torture test is a full grid start, and even with things turned down to what I consider a modest level of detail, the start was in the mid-teens for a frame rate.  I wish that game engines would be optimized for full grid starts rather than cars alone on the track.  Microprose's Grand Prix 3 dealt with this problem by simply replacing cars far enough ahead of you with 2D sprites.  Although not perfect, the programmers clearly understood the relative importance of a high frame rate at the start even if they couldn't render as many polygons as necessary to show all these cars, even if they were off in the distance.  One advantage F1 2000 has over its competitors is the ability to record large replays.  You can turn on a replay system that saves a user-defined number of minutes of replay. It then assigns that replay to the file name that coincides with the track you're racing on. Compare this to the ~one lap only~ replay in GP3 and it becomes obvious that F1 2000 has the superior replay system, with lots of replay cameras and VCR controls to give you full control over what you see.  While the above 'fixes' could be considered to be areas that EA should have incorporated into a patch/upgrade, obviously EA felt the need to add a few things as well.  First, they updated the tracks, so that Indianapolis is more accurate, some tracks have been touched up, and the new chicane at Monza is incorporated.  This means that F1CS2K is the only 'up to date' F1 simulation.  Grand Prix 3 is a couple of years old, and F1 World Grand Prix is behind a year.  The next major feature would be the addition of a driving school.  EA copied the Gran Turismo/NASCAR Heat model and created challenges in which you can complete for bronze, silver and gold trophies, and each successful challenge unlocks the next one.  These are interesting and will certainly reinforce the need for smooth clean driving and fast reactions.  However, the school is completed all too easily (unless you insist on getting a gold on every challenge).    The other new feature is the weather system.  You can now have rainy races.  I haven't particularly noticed that it's much more difficult to drive in the wet than in the dry assuming I'm using wet weather tires.  The other problem is that the weather is not dynamic.  It's either a rainy weekend, or a dry weekend, or random.  You can also ask for the same weather that was on the actual race day.  Unfortunately, some fixes are still absent.  For instance, your in-car view is way too confining, and there is no head panning.  Even if you assume that the cockpit view is otherwise accurate, there is no one holding the driver's head straight forward (and in fact, from some camera angles you see the driver's helmet looking into the turns).  But in this game you are stuffed down close to the front wheels, and you can't even see the outsides of them.  You cannot look into the turn, which tends to cause drivers to make the mistake of early turn-ins, making hitting apexes a task more challenging then should be necessary.  Audio continues to be a strong point with the game.  The sounds have been updated and I think they sound pretty good, particularly the backfiring of the engine as it brakes and the car downshifts into a turn.  Unlike its main competitor, Grand Prix 3, a very active crew chief keeps you up to date with what's going on around the track.  Even during qualifying, you'll be notified when your opposition has left the pits, whether or not one of your splits has been broken, whether someone new has captured the pole, etc.  There are also warnings of spins and other problems at various places around the track.  Most importantly, this review has to concentrate on gameplay.  The fact is, if you have to have a 'feel' for the way the car is handling, this is the best modern Formula One simulation there is.  With the driving aids turned on, the game is easier to drive, perhaps more like Grand Prix 3, but when you are ready to get serious, the game's sophisticated physics engine will keep you challenged.  I also found it very difficult to get into a good enough rhythm where I could rip off lap after lap with the computer AI and not make a mistake.  This game has longevity in the same way that Grand Prix Legends does in that it will take time and effort to run a long race with the AI and not spin yourself out of contention, damage or not.  But the major purchasing decision here is, unfortunately, your hardware.  Being a totally polygonal game with a still less-than-stellar graphics engine, you need to have a current generation computer and graphics card to really get the most out of the game. If graphics mean little to you and you are willing to sacrifice it to get the frame rates, perhaps this doesn't apply to you, but most people I know want a fair amount of graphical flair in their games and older graphics cards and CPU's below, say, 500MHz, are going to be hard pressed to provide this.  For the relatively lower end computers I still recommend Grand Prix 3 as a fine Formula One racer with depth and solid AI, but it just lacks the 'feel of the car' that F1 2000 has, and now that F1 2000 has more competitive AI, it is no longer a 'hotlap-only' game.  I did do a fair number of laps trying to develop a fast setup for Hungary and ultimately ended up downloading one that someone made for F1 2000 (since the game is backward compatible).  It helped a fair amount, demonstrating both the need for comparative telemetry and the fact that I'm still not great at setting up a car!)  Of course, I wish it had that telemetry feature since Grand Prix 3 does, and historical scenarios wouldn't hurt, either, but perhaps my biggest feature disappointment in the PC sequel is that in the PlayStation version, EA put in a driving coach that would let you go around any course and provide feedback about your driving.  You might be told that you missed the apex, or you turned in too early, braked too late, got too much wheelspin out of the corner, or whatever.  This kind of ~Racing School~ is the coolest thing to have when going around the track and trying to correct bad habits, and its absence makes the learning curve steeper than it should be for newcomers.  I hope that it gets integrated into the next release.  Another thing I was disappointed with was that drafting and turbulence don't seem well developed in this game.  Of course, modeling F1 perfectly would make passing nearly impossible, but it would be nice to get more of a tow on a long straight, and perhaps not be able to follow so close through a corner without generating some understeer.  The Official F1 Simulation a couple years ago from Lankhor did that and it was rather challenging to have to time my closure to the car in front to ensure enough downforce in the front of the car to make a pass.  Maybe next time.  If you purchased F1 2000 and felt that it just needed some serious AI and weather, then F1CS2K is a worthwhile upgrade, even if it's with some bitterness that you're paying for what should have been in the first edition.  If you have the same hardware that you had for the first one and wanted a higher frame rate, then you might try the demo or buy from a place that takes returns.  While higher frame rates have been reported, I didn't see enough of a dramatic improvement to make me think I would have bought this if I hadn't been able to get the right mix of graphics and gameplay the first time out.  -- Randy Magruder      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  In the end, EA has made a decent and somewhat playable PS2 F1 game, but not one I would recommend to people who take their racing games very seriously, especially given the very limited feature set of the first release, the overly arcade-style physics model, and the poorly modeled AI. If you think the game might be fun even with these limitations, the game is worth a rental. It looks and sounds nice, but doesn't have the lasting challenge and realistic gameplay I would have hoped to find, especially considering the high quality job done on their PC title. It's fair to say that this game represents a stripped down version of its Playstation cousin, but with better graphics, sound, and perhaps vehicle dynamics. Until EA holds its motorsports simulations up to the same high standards as its sports simulations (Madden springs to mind), we are going to continue to get arcade games with F1 tracks and cars slapped onto them, while being told that realism just doesn't matter on a console because it just doesn't make for good gameplay. Let's pray they wake up soon, as they did at some point when users were tired of putting up triple digit games in Madden because of bad AI and realism.", "date": "Jan 3, 2001"}
