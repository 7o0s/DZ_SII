{"name": "WCW Nitro", "name_review": "WCW Nitro", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/16/wcw-nitro-3", "text": "Whether you like pro wrestling or not, you've got to admit that WCW Monday Nitro packs a lot of action and entertainment value  but unfortunately for PC game fans who've been waiting for years for a good pro wrestling game, WCW Nitro delivers very little of either.  WCW Nitro has all the basics of a good wrestling game: over 60 stars from WCW and NWO, one-on-one and tag-team bouts, a Battle Royal mode, commentary from Monday Nitro announcers Tony Schiavonne and Mike Tenay, wrestlers jumping in to interfere in bouts, and even ~rants~ you can listen to before a match begins. Once you start playing, though, you'll discover that almost everyone one of these features is flawed in some way  assuming you can look past the game's ugly graphics, clumsy control, and unconvincing animations long enough to find out, that is.  Take those 60-plus wrestlers, for instance. It's admirable that TGQ laid out the cash to license all those names, but why didn't they make more of them readily available? When you first load up WCW Nitro you have only 16 wrestlers to work with; the only way you get to see new ones is if they run in during a Tournament  and you have to win the tournament, to boot! So I braced myself for an hour or so of crappy gaming (because you can't save your progress after a Tournament match, grrrrrr.....) in order to see who'd be added to the roster, but guess what? No new wrestlers ran into the ring! Hey, I'm okay with hidden wrestlers  unless there are three times as many of them as there are ~unhidden~ wrestlers. Thanks a lot, THQ, for making it so tough to enjoy your game.  Half the fun of watching Monday Nitro is all the extraneous stuff going on  Sting lurking around in the rafters, Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen strutting into the ring, Buff Bagwell and Scott Steiner kicking somebody's ass in the parking lot outside the arena, Scott Hall staggering around like he's been drinking, the Ultimate Warrior mysteriously appearing and disappearing in the dressing room and rings  but you don't get any of that in WCW Nitro. The ~rants~ are just short video clips of each wrestler talking to you, the user, not the audience or an opponent  pretty lame stuff. Nitro girls? Nope. Eric Bischoff? Nope (unless he's one of the hidden wrestlers). Confrontations between members of NWO Black and White and NWO Wolfpack, or WCW and NWO? Nope. Flashy entrances with cool music? Nope. It's all been boiled down to the action inside the squared circle, so the success of WCW Nitro depends entirely on how well it looks and plays.  And wrestling fans, I'm here to tell you it doesn't look too good or play very well. In a bizarre decision  or, more likely, laziness in translating the manual from the PlayStation version  all the moves have been documented for keyboard users (sure, like someone who buys this game will play it hitting keys). So to figure out the moves, you've got to ~translate~ the documentation: ~Back-S-F~ is really ~Back-Punch-Kick.~ Why didn't they use actions instead of keys to describe all the moves, especially since users can re-configure both gamepad buttons and keystroke commands and basically invalidate the manual? Another gripe is that the moves aren't designed for ease of use: it's a lot easier to make multiple moves on the direction pad (Back-Back-Kick, for instance) than making you search around for different buttons. Topping it off is the lack of default support for even two gamepads, much less four for tag-team matches with your friends: the only way you can use a second pad is to program in the keystrokes, an unnecessary pain in the ass that WCW Monday Nitro fans shouldn't have to put up with even if they've got a pad they can program.  Even when you figure them out, pulling off special moves can be a bitch since many of them work only in certain conditions, and if you attempt one involving the ~action~ command near the ropes, the chances are good you'll wind up climbing out of the ring instead of putting the finishing touches on your opponent. I've played a lot of fighting games, and never had as much trouble pulling off moves as I did in WCW Nitro. Apparently even the computer-controlled opponents found it irksome, too: I saw my opponents use the same three or four moves (power-bomb, pile-driver, vertical suplex, and backbreaker) about 90% of the time. Dulling things up even more is the sparse and predictable commentary (if I hear ~He's kicked out!~ one more time I'm gonna scream!), the lack of foreign objects like chairs and tables, and some of the worse background graphics I've seen in a ~sports~ game in quite a while. Granted, the 3D graphics for the wrestlers are pretty decent, especially the digitized faces, but their herky-jerky movements and weak AI routines did anything but encourage a willing suspension of disbelief.  I tried giving WCW Nitro chances to redeem itself, but each session left me as cold as Hollywood Hogan's black little heart. Go ahead and download the demo if you're ultra-desperate for wrestling action on your PC, but if I were you I'd bide my time and wait for something better than this  and with the kind of ratings pro rating's getting nowadays, you can bet your turnbuckle there'll be another one coming along before you know it.
