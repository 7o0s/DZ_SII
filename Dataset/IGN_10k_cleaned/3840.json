We've all come into contact with a TV series we love, adore or cherish, and we crave its byproducts, whatever they may be. I rarely watch TV, but when I do it's an all-Sunday affair, and I do it with my wife and child. I start with the 7 pm showing of Futurama, skip King of the Hill, tune in for The Simpsons and when it was good, we always eyed The X-Files. I'm guilty as charged of being an unabashed Futurama fan.   There are far worse sins, I'm sure. And I think I just finished playing one of them. Futurama the game, like so many disappointing Simpsons games before it, is an interactive cartoon created around the unadulterated humor of Matt Groening and his team of artists, writers and animators. Unlike all previous Simpsons games, however, Futurama borders on being good.    Many things are right on the money. The voice-acting is spot-on, with every character's voice performed by the original TV series voice-actors. The animation is mostly good, with a few hiccups here and there (except in the cutscenes, where it's nearly perfect). The story is hilarious; it's exactly like an episode from the TV series. And the formulaic gameplay is almost different enough from the rest of the games in the genre to make this fan turn a blind eye. But alas, the glut of problems is far too obvious to ignore, which leaves us with the final product. While Futurama is the best game to date based on a Matt Groening TV series, that's not saying much. The TV series' one and only game will be solely appreciated by fans, and even then, they might have second thoughts.   Gameplay  Futurama is an OK game with a great license and one big ~IF~ attached to it. One must enjoy the animated and futuristic Matt Groening show. Never liked the show? Stop reading right now and do not plan on buying it. You won't like it. But if you like Futurama, then I suspect you'll play this game driven by the same impetus as me: Contained within it is about 30 minutes of Futurama show footage, comprising an entirely original episode. For me, and I suspect for fans of the series, this upper echelon episode is worth playing through the game for, despite the game's many problems.   Cel-shaded and story-driven in the simplest of terms, Futurama has its charms. The third-person perspective action-platformer enables players to take on the role of the three main characters from the TV show, Fry, Leela and Bender, each with their distinct set of attacks, moves and deadly one-liners. Players start as Fry in the sewers, continue on as Bender in the desert canyon of a junkyard asteroid, and they then finish off as Leela on the Sun Planet. Given Fry's lack of talent for anything, he earns a cache of guns with which to blast enemies. Bender offers a patchwork of mechanical attacks and Leela is a martial arts expert fighting hand-to-hand.    My family and I sat down to play this game and, for the first 15 minutes, we were all in stitches just experiencing the first few objectives. Fry's first mission, for instance, is to find a simple hammer for the Professor. (Spoiler ahead) The tool is precariously set underneath a stack of objects that come crashing down on him, killing him instantly. Luckily, thanks to the professor's new re-animation machine, which looks like a giant toaster, Fry returns to life. The toaster is a vehicle for parodying the many gamer ~lives~ we're all so used to and it's just one of many instances in which the game comically breaks the fifth dimension. Playing as the reanimated Fry, players return to the scene of the accident and even see his newly dead body, his head crushed flat. There are dozens of scenarios that'll make Futurama fans happy, whether through witty one-liners, smart cutscenes or typical Groening situations.     Developer Unique Development Studios (Monster Jam, Sno-Cross Championship Racing, World's Scariest Police Chases) is not known for its super high-quality games to date (though  World's Scariest Police Chases wasn't half bad), and Futurama won't change its reputation. But it's crafted an old-school arcade game, the doubled-edged type of old-school game. It's old-school in the sense that Futurama features lots of blasting, platforming and been-there-done that puzzles, keycard scenarios, big empty environments with breakable objects, collectibles and power-ups. More specifically it's old-school because the platform elements require precision jumping, yet the game doesn't provide precision jumping controls. The game's biggest weakness is its reliance on said platforming elements, which require just as much luck as they do skill. Not good.     The Fry levels aren't too bad, though some of the alligator sections are annoying, and the AI can be cheap and unforgiving. The Bender levels can be gruesomely cheap, and the Leela levels aren't much better. I'm thinking of the girder section in particular, in which Bender must leap precariously across eight hanging steel girders. Up until this point, I had not died once. But trying to jump from girder to girder, I lost all eight of my lives within less than two minutes. Nice! The biggest problem with this section and with the controls in particular is that the characters control poorly, sloppily and inconsistently. When there are shadows beneath them they don't help, the area of contact around the characters' feet (i.e. collision detection) is inconsistently programmed, as are the platforms in which players jump, and only through repetition and chance will players progress through some of these levels. It's not so difficult as it is frustrating.    The rest of the game is pretty much formulaic arcade fluff. In other words, one can blast through Futurama in about six or so hours, without ever being able to pinpoint any particular gameplay moment worth its weight in salt. The AI is simple and easy to figure out, including all the bosses; the levels are linear and easy to figure out, and the switch between each of the characters is easy to adjust to.    A few words on some especially cool features: Fry gets to pilot a Chicken Walker/Mech, which is very fun; Fry's Tommy Gun is especially frenetic, and a few of Leela's levels are memorable. Again and again, however, playing this game comes down to being a fan's level of appreciation. Hearing the one-liners, seeing the cutscenes, and unlocking the story makes Futurama's rough gameplay bearable.    Graphics  Futurama is not terribly pretty. But then again, Groening's comic style has never been complex or glittery, so the game never sets out to beat Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty or Halo in a graphics contest. Thus, the simple, cel-shaded characters and backgrounds re-create the TV show well enough, with only a few hitches.   Bender looks better than the rest, probably because he's a robot, while Fry, the professor and Leela appear a little differently. Most of the time, they appear to be respectable 3D re-creations from the TV show, but some of the simplest shading appears clouded and distracting, actually ruining the simplicity of the artistic style. Black lines appear and re-appear to accentuate characters' facial features as they talk in cutscenes, and it just looks shoddy. The same lines blink in and out during gameplay scenes too, causing minor irritations and frowns. The game's textures are all flat, simple and understated. Or one could say forgettable, generic and bland. Depends on what you like.    The game runs slightly better (i.e. slightly faster than 30 FPS) on Xbox than on PS2, but for the most part, the technology behind each system is almost entirely unused, so VU's title looks adequate but not pretty on either system. It's a shame to see a title so simplistically designed not look good, nor run at a smooth and flawless 60 frames per second. With hardly any special effects running at all (besides some decent particle effects shown in explosions and realtime lighting shown as an enemy shoots a blast past you in the dark), and hardly any textures or complex enemy AI to program, it's very curious why this doesn't look sharp, fast and spot on.    Sound  Like so many Simpsons games before it, Futurama provides superb aural content. The music is a little funny, in that it remixes tunes from the show. Players might recognize a theme, and then the melody gets lost in the remix, peppered with sound effects or even voices from the cast slid in for randomness, and then it comes back to the theme for good measure. Along with pieces of artwork and cutscenes, players also unlock music as they progress.    The original voice talent is what makes Futurama most palette-able. Billy West (Fry), Katey Sagal (Leela) and John Di (Bender) as well as the entire cast of characters (actually, you'd be surprised at how many voices these three do) provide vocal talent for the game.    And, given that Groening and the clever writers from the show have written the game's script, the cutscenes are not only almost visually perfect, they're aurally perfect as well. If it's not Bender saying things like ~Sit down and shut up...for ever!~ after blasting an enemy, or Leela asking ~Cool, now I'm a playable character?~ or Fry realizing ~Hey, these are the things that Bender is always stealing from me~ (referring to money), it's the Professor saying things like ~Avenge my head!~ or ~It's all fine, except for the Phantom hemorrhoids.~ Fans of the show will enjoy listening to every word in the game. Lastly, even the enemies crack humorous one-liners. And if they don't, they'll make horribly unusual sounds that are funny enough on their own. Needless to say, sound is crucial to this game's success.While I've said everything that needs to be said, I'll wrap it up neatly here. Futurama was created for fans of the show, of which I suspect there are many, and for these folks, it's going to be a fun, if not slightly rough, gameplay experience. But the storyline, when all unfolded, is a top-notch episode all on its own, funny and disturbing and filled with character, color and the distinct wit of Matt Groening. There is good variety to the gameplay with three playable characters, and there is enough hilarious stuff, be it unlockables or just the simple sounds of enemies snuffling, burping or quipping one-liners, to keep players engaged. Futurama, however, is filled with technical, gameplay and even graphic problems. Of its many weaknesses, ranging across the board from unoriginal gameplay to poor collision detection to shoddy controls, to a distinct lack of polish in both playability and graphic finesse, the game is also short. Buying this game really rests on this question: Want to play as Fry, Leela and Bender in a shoddy, but slightly better than average game? If you do, you're rewarded with an original Futurama episode, lots of visual and aural unlockables and you'll laugh and have a good time. If not, save your $50 for something else.", "date": "Aug 12, 2003"}
