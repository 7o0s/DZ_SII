And why not? It's an incredible-looking title  easily one of the most visually stunning racing games ever seen.  The graphics are simply outstanding  particularly on an accelerated PC. The backgrounds and cars are exquisitely rendered and make the game look very realistic. The attention to detail is also superlative. Leaves fly as cars race by, headlights reflect on wet surfaces, the way the cars light the road during night driving is highly realistic and the weather effects are the best yet seen  particularly the spray from other cars when you're driving right behind them.  The outstanding visuals are backed up with a huge roster of options and cars. Like previous NFS games, there is a stable of highly desirable cars. These include the Lamborghini Diablo and Countach, Ferrari 355F1 and 550, Jaguar XJR-15 and XK8, Aston Martin DB7, Mercedes SL600 and CLK GTR and even a police pursuit Corvette C5. The cars are categorized into three classes, essentially giving the player three different categories of racing. There are eight different tracks to race the cars on, with bonus tracks available for players with the skills to unlock them. All tracks are circuits  a disappointment for me. I'd prefer a variety of tracks, both point-to-point and circuits, to help add variety to the racing.  Speaking of racing, NFSIII features four different races: Single Race, Hot Pursuit, Knockout and Tournament. Single Race is just that  a one-off race against a variety of computer opponents. It's a good way to get into the game, or just to have a quick go between writing reviews (he he he). Hot Pursuit is where the player races another driver around a cop-infested track with a simple mandate: cross the finish line with no tickets. This is definitely great fun, and is enhanced with a ~scanner~ that picks up police radio chatter and lets you know what the ~good~ guys are up to so you can take avoiding action if need be. The police AI is pretty good, and they try to bump you off the road and even set up roadblocks in an attempt to catch you. And if they do that more than three times, it's off to virtual jail you go. Knockout is a straightforward race where the driver who finishes last is eliminated. Eight drivers start the tournament  only one can win it. Finally, Tournament is an eight-round championship in which drivers compete for points. The better the finishing position, the more points scored  and the driver who has scored highest by the end of the final round wins. Driver AI is very good on this and all races, and provides a good challenge to even the most hardcore of racing fans. There are bonus cars and tracks available to win on all races (except the single race), depending on whether the beginner or expert levels of gameplay are selected. Oh, and there are also LAN and 'net multiplayer racing options for those with the relevant hardware.  As a package, NFSIII is certainly a tempting prospect. But unfortunately, for all its stunning visuals, for all its marvelous presentation, options and fancy stuff, Need for Speed III is fundamentally flawed.  The biggest disappointment is the handling engine. It's the antithesis of the sumptuous, realistic visuals. It's pitched somewhere between arcade and simulation, but unfortunately falls into a simplistic no-man's land between the two. It doesn't have the exaggerated, over-the-top, lurid power-sliding feel that an arcade racer should have, and neither is it ~simmy~ enough to be able to drive realistically. Instead, you have a game that feels very wooden and vague. The handling engine's feedback to the player is sanitized and simplistic, and feels like it was designed for the most inexperienced, ham-fisted of PC racers. Driving this game is easy  just floor it, get on the brakes for a corner, and then back on the throttle after turn-in. There are no real power slides, no real danger of the car going out of control unless you hit something and no feeling of being on the edge. It's safe, sanitized and ultimately, very unsatisfying.  The collision detection is also poor, and you can do really stupid things like flip the car up and over, but as long as it lands on its wheels, it just keeps on going like nothing happened. Very unrealistic.  There are also a couple of visual problems too. The wheels of most cars don't turn properly, and the cars themselves don't look anchored to the ground  they seem to be floating along. The car reflections are also unrealistic  they're way too clean-looking and just don't look quite right.  When it comes to the crunch, NFSIII isn't a bad game. In some respects it's very good. But let's just get this straight. I'm a driving nut. I love cars, and I love driving games with a passion. So therefore I'm very picky about what I drive. And if you're the same as me, you'll feel the same way about NFSIII: a reasonable racer that will provide sufficient entertainment until something better comes along, which hopefully won't be too long. I think I can best describe Need for Speed III as something that looks like a top-of-the-line sports car, but drives like an average US sedan  vague, imprecise and without driver feedback. But, that kind of car seems to please millions of drivers who want something that gets the job done with little fuss and excitement, and if you're one of those, then NFSIII will deliver what you desire. But if it's sophisticated, realistic sports car thrills and spills you're after, you'll probably be left wanting. As I was.  -- Jaz Rignall", "date": "Oct 14, 1998"}
