Sweet God, I still loathe that level. With pixel-perfect jump requirements and a ticking clock that doesn't let you slow down, it's a bastardly level that I've never been able to conquer for ten years. World 8-2's concept of ~one mistake equals instantaneous death~ is one that's always frustrated me to no avail, and Super Magnetic Niu-Niu on the Dreamcast has it in spades.   But let's give you some background on the title first: Super Magnetic Niu-Niu is a 3D platformer from Japanese developer Genki, with retro art direction that looks like it was pulled from a cheesy 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoon. You control a baby-blue robot named Niu-Niu, sent on a mission to save PaoPaoPark from an evil, foul-mouthed toddler hell-bent on world domination. Niu-Niu combines the familiar 3D platforming of Crash Bandicoot, while tossing in some truly innovative gameplay features.   Most of the game is played from a behind-the-shoulder perspective, as Niu-Niu walks into the screen on a linear track. Sure, the ultimate goal is to do jumping puzzles and blow up bad guys, but how you do this is actually pretty cool. Aside from running and jumping abilities, Niu-Niu has the ability to fire off two magnetic fields  red and blue. By firing his red pulse at a blue enemy, Niu-Niu can pull them in and encase them in a box (remember that opposites attract), which can be picked up and tossed at other baddies. By firing a blue pulse at a blue enemy, he pushes them away. Unleashing a red pulse while standing on a red magnetic pad propels you skyward, and you can latch on to magnetic ~vines~ to swing across chasms. When it works like it's supposed to, the ~magnetic~ gameplay is extremely enjoyable .  Niu-Niu's gameplay suffers a bit from the 3D perspective. Niu-Niu walks a good deal slower than his Bandicoot brethren, and his ~Dash~ move feels uncontrollable  all you can do is point him in the right direction and hit the trigger button. Niu-Niu also has trouble climbing steps, and you have to jump onto magnetic pads  even if they're only three inches off the ground. Judging your placement on the screen in regards to pits, chasms, and jump pads can also be tricky. Fortunately, Niu-Niu casts shadows on the ground in a realistic fashion, facilitating a lot of the jumping puzzles you'll encounter.   The developers at Genki were responsible for the spot-on conversion of Virtua Fighter 3, and it's obvious that these boys know their Dreamcast hardware inside and out. The game almost always maintains 60fps, with relatively high polygon counts and decent texture detail. Niu-Niu himself has some outstanding facial animation, and starts to do the bad-ass Niu-Niu dance if left unattended. The game's art direction is really outstanding, and looks like a stylized cartoon come to full 3D life.   But all the pretty graphics in the world can't redeem the fact that after the first four levels, Niu-Niu gets evil. This is one of the most frustrating, stress-inducing games I've ever encountered, and I've got a smashed Niu-Niu CD case to prove it. You see, there are no energy bars in Niu-Niu. If the little blue bastard gets hit once, he dies, and you restart. He very rarely grabs onto ledges if he just misses a leap  he dies, and you restart. There is zero room for error in this game, and certain stages can only be beaten after dozens of unsuccessful tries and cheap deaths. This is a result of difficult, demanding levels (not necessarily a bad thing) and utterly crap design (definitely bad thing).    For example, let's take a look at the first stage of the desert world, where Niu-Niu hops on a robotic camel, and has to steer for his life through a sandy oasis. The collision box around Niu-Niu is very large, meaning you don't need to visibly touch an enemy object (like a cactus) to die unexpectedly. Giant stone circles roll at you, and you'll need pre-requisite knowledge of the paths they follow  it's rote memorization all the way. Ugh.   Once you've passed the first checkpoint, enemy camel-riders appear, and start racing against you. If you touch them, you die. If you hit a jump-pad and accidentally land on top of them, you die. Believe it or not, it's randomly impossible to beat the stage based on certain timing issues  an enemy rider may be occupying a jump-pad you need to propel yourself to safety. Normally, I'd complain about the over excessive slowdown that plagues this stage, but the frame rate drop to 20fps actually makes things more playable.   Other needless frustrations abound in the world of Niu-Niu, resulting from gameplay that demands the reflexes of a caffeine-injected ten-year-old, along with the precise knowledge of a level's contents before you even start. So much of the player's success seems completely random  and fuzzy logic like that doesn't belong in a platform game. It's painful when you know exactly what you have to do, but are limited by fiddly physics that only seem to work in your favor fifty percent of the time.   After many hours of repeating the same levels in Niu-Niu, I was ready to ~magnetically~ propel my Dreamcast against the closest wall in frustration. The fun-factor and level of difficulty vary chaotically between levels: sometimes, I swore that I was playing a brilliantly-designed Treasure side-scroller; other times, I just swore like a sailor and vowed to kick the ass of whoever was responsible.   If you're ready for a challenge, then by gum, Super Magnetic Niu-Niu has got it this game was designed for 3D platforming fiends, and it will test your mettle in ways you never thought possible. On the other hand, if you're easily stressed out, this probably isn't the best way to spent your time  you may end up a basket case. Let's just hope that the developers at Crave can touch up the overall package for a US release  otherwise, this game will be hitting the Super Magnetic Bargain Bin.   -- Colin ~Super Magnetic Freelancer~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 8, 2000"}
