Players advance through stages by moving around jewel icons to try and match three or more in a row or column. When they're lined up, the icons blow up, giving you points and bringing more into the board. As more blocks fall, combos can be triggered if the icons happen to line up with three or more in a row. You switch jewels in pairs, and if a switch doesn't result in a three or more match, it can't be performed. Jewel Quest does differ from Bejeweled 2 in a few ways, however. First, the goal of each stage isn't to net a certain amount of points in a time limit, but rather to turn all the squares to gold. Accomplishing this requires you to blow up a block in every square of each level's grid, which turns out to be an enjoyable challenge.   Jewel Quest isn't the deepest Xbox Live Arcade game out there. For 800 Microsoft Points you'll get the offline single player game and leaderboards, and that's pretty much it. There's no special challenge mode, no online battle mode, nothing beyond the basic content. Spread out over five main levels each broken up into numerous sublevels, the single player content will take you a number of hours to flip your way through. Of course, buying XBLA games isn't necessarily about beating them, it's more about getting high scores. Despite the relative dearth of gameplay options, you'll find the gameplay interesting enough to keep coming back for a while.   Jewel discrimination continues. Not only do you need to disintegrate a block in every one of the game's grids, but do so within a time limit. If time runs out, you die. Lives can be replenished by reaching specific score numbers. Each level presents a different shaped jewel-filled grid. Changing all the grid squares to gold causes an artifact on the screen's left to light up. Once the artifact is entirely lit up, you progress to the next stage. There's a storyline that makes a feeble attempt at tying the artifacts and grid puzzles together logistically, but it's nothing worth paying attention to.   Sound effects are sparse, consisting of a few plinks and clinks for moving crystals and blowing them up. Underneath strums a bassline overlaid with jungle chirps and drum beats, and during levels you'll be treated to a decent string arrangement. Graphics are bright and clean, making it easy to recognize shapes and move them accordingly. The simple controls, consisting of hitting the A button and moving crystals in one of four directions, work as they should. Overall it's a solid, challenging puzzle experience, just extremely limited in terms of content. Also, if you don't like Bejeweled 2, don't bother with this one.", "date": "Apr 26, 2006"}
