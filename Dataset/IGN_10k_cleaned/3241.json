The result is the Bits Studios developed Die Hard: Vendetta, a unique FPS that blends the dynamics of taking hostages with intense close-range shootouts. Bits Studios previously had experience developing for Nintendo platforms while it was developing Riqa for the Nintendo 64. Although the project was cancelled, it did give the company a head start on developing for GameCube thanks to its good ties with Nintendo.   However, despite the head start and the ambitious ideas, Die Hard: Vendetta just hasn't come together as we would have hoped. The gameplay, which is spiced up with a library of amusing Die Hard-worthy expletives, is simply too unrefined. In the end it's a product that Die Hard fans should check out, but it can't compete with the high standards set by recent first-person shooters.   The Facts Fill the shoes of the aged John McClane years after the movies take place Travel into many famous L.A. locales over the course of the game Players must tactically decide whether they want to storm a room or move in and attempt to take a bad-guy hostage As McClane, you can jump, lean around corners, crouch, and move with dual analog control A host of real-life weapons, ranging from pistols to crossbows to flamethrowers Cinematic effects highlight intense moments with camera pans and slowed bullet time Graphics engine offers up a 60 fps experience the stutters often, but delivers some crisp textures, real-time reflection mapping, and light refraction Progressive scan support Widescreen support Basic stereo surround; no Dolby Pro Logic II support   Gameplay Die Hard: Vendetta is based on your standard first-person shooter mechanics; move from room to room and kill the bad guys. However, it attempts to take those dynamics to a new level with the integration of hostage taking. So, while the enemies will be using innocent people to leverage against you, you will be able to move in stealthily, turn the tables, and take one of them hostage. This is not required, but a choice the player can make throughout the course of the adventure. This seems to be the focal point Bits Studios had in mind while designing this single-player only game. There is no multiplayer, no extra fluff. It's a story-based adventure that pits you in the shoes of Die Hard's John McClane as he tries to save his daughter Lucy from the hands of Hans Gruber's son.   The whole plot unfolds around you via cut-scenes and in-game dialogue. To execute upon that concept, Bits Studios has included a ton of audio cues where McClane can strike up a conversation with basically everyone he sees. Sometimes they will help you on your objective, and other times they're useless. More often than not, McClane's cocky attitude comes shining through; he threatens to have those who cross him eating through straws or bids them farewell into the afterlife by calling them ~dicks.~ This kind of profanity is frequent, and one of the more appealing traits of Die Hard: Vendetta. Thankfully, Bits Studios did not hold back and has created a very mature and often comical experience for those interested. It fits the license and helps retain the idea that you are playing as Bruce Willis...err, John McClane.      Bigger than the story development, though, is most certainly the core mechanics of the experience. The dynamics of action versus stealth sets the stage for a number of different experiences. What it means is that while you may waltz into a room, guns blazing, and take out the bad guys, chances are you're going to take some damage. So, if you take things slowly, you can often use your ears and eyes to spot possible hostages that you can use for leverage. In most cases the thugs they are working with will put down their guns and accommodate your needs. Occasionally there are those that just don't care, shooting their own comrades in order to get at you. This is the main dynamic in the otherwise standard FPS environment. Unfortunately, it isn't intuitive or versatile enough to make the experience more entertaining. It works perfectly in some instances, but in others it can be cause for major frustration.   For example, in the second level some gang members are fooling around with the clothes racks in a store, trying things on. Without rushing into the store, you can hear this from their dialogue. You might assume it's safe just to step right into the store and take your hostage, but you have to learn at what point in the audio cue it's safe. Otherwise, the store clerks die; objective failed. So, at that point taking hostages becomes trial and error. It just doesn't feel right. Bits Studios has seemingly tried to make the experience feel random and natural, but it only comes across as scripted. That certainly doesn't make it a bad inclusion in Die Hard: Vendetta. It's just the other way around. The hostage dynamics are intriguing and intermittently entertaining, acting as a perfect device to break up the monotony of shooting foolish criminals. However, it lacks the consistency it needs to make the title stand out in an already crowded FPS genre.   Meanwhile, the dual analog controls, while they basically adhere to your console FPS style, have issues. For starters, Bits Studios designed Vendetta to default to auto aim. It's not remotely subtle. As you walk into rooms your gun crosshair is magnetized to the closest enemy. Frankly, we think it ruins the experience unless you're an amateur FPS player or a child. Except, regarding the latter, Vendetta is obviously not for kids. So, the good news is you can switch auto aim off. This really opens up the experience, but instead of being too easy, it becomes very demanding. You'll have to take everything very slowly, and when you hear gunfire you are forced to duck for cover. The controls allow you to lean around the corners and aim with far more precision. However, the difficulty ends up on the other side of the spectrum, forcing you to manage your health by finding every medkit placed throughout the level and making all the right decisions. This is fine for hardcore gamers, but the mass audience has no happy medium. Auto-aim feels infantile and switching it off feels unreliable.   The control issues don't stop there, though. You'll have to do some basic jumping, and although Bits was kind enough to include an auto jump, it only serves to get in the way. There's something about it that feels too synthetic, and it's easy to accidentally jump in the wrong direction. You have the power to switch this off, but much like taking away your auto aim it creates new problems.   The whole package seems to suffer from this inability to attain a balance. On the one hand, Die Hard: Vendetta has some great dialogue, and when combined with the ability to take hostages you'll find there are some very interesting situations that arise. You feel empowered, bringing you a step closer to ~being~ McClane. There's even a neat Hero Mode that you can trigger a few times per mission. Temporarily slowing down time while McClane recalls Beethoven's ~Ninth~ (he hummed it in the movie), you'll be able to storm into rooms and fire off several rounds before your foes can do the same. Despite all these ideas, though, Vendetta just lacks polish and cohesiveness.   Vendetta is best reserved only for the most passionate Die Hard fan. You get a little taste of what it's like to be the grizzled John McClane, complete with his bad mouth and hardcore attitude. For everyone else, it's a middle of the road FPS experience with some interesting, yet flawed, gameplay ideas. With no multiplayer to back it, it's probably something you'll want to rent before you buy.   Graphics Visually, Vendetta looks a lot like an aged PC first-person shooter. Rooms and environments tend to be very square in shape and lacking complicated architecture. Meanwhile, the textures may be crisp in many instances, but they're also tiled with little variation. The whole look isn't helped by the fact that the engine has series framerate problems, dropping frequently from 60.   As well character models, only moderate in polygon density, are poorly animated and often reused throughout the level despite the fact that you may have just offed someone who looks just like them. Sure they have facial animations and lip synching, but it basically just produces a puppet-like effect, which doesn't help to immerse you in the environment.     What it does do well are some of the more subtle effects including image refraction, real-time reflection mapping, and water effects. For example, McClane's nicely modeled silver pistol casts reflections of the world around him. Basically it remaps the scenery just ahead of McClane back on to his gun. So, the reflections aren't perfect, but they are varied and if you're not examining it under the microscope like us, it's pretty believable. Speaking of positive visual effects, the reload animations are also great, complete with moving fingers and hands.   Vendetta also features widescreen and progressive scan support. Special thanks to Bits Studios for pushing the two formats.   Sound This is where Vendetta shines through; tons of crystal clear and often well-acted dialogue at every corner. Reginald VelJohnson, who played the cop in the movies, has actually been courted to do his voice in the game, and they got a fairly decent sound-alike for Bruce Willis. There's no mocking him perfectly, but the replacement is suitable and carry's the same smoky, sarcastic tone to his voice. The sound effects are also handled well enough with varied gunshots and footsteps that vary according to surface material. There's no major surround support, though, which is disappointing. Die Hard: Vendetta didn't quite turn out how I envisioned it would. From the hostage-taking dynamics to the controls, the experience just feels unpolished. It can be fun, but there are a lot of frustrations that come along with it to sour the experience a little.Above all, I think I enjoyed the dialogue the most. There's some witty lines, and instead of being a static, nearly silent environment, you get to talk to people everywhere. You get to talk trash. You get to say things heroes like John McClane would. So there are some things to like, but the overall experience feels unrefined, almost rushed. Definitely check it out at the nearest rental shop. If you're interested in buying, make sure you're a hardcore Die Hard fan. There's no multiplayer experience, so unless you absolutely love the single-player, there's not much to fall back on.", "date": "Nov 20, 2002"}
