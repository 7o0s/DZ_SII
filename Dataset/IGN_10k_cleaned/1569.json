Believe it or not, Alien Crush was one of the defining titles on the old Turbo Grafx 16.  And Sonic Spinball was chosen by Sega as one of its big Christmas titles the year following Sonic 2's record-breaking launch - not too shabby for a title based on pinball mechanics.   And then we have  Neo Golden Logress, a pinball videogame with a Knights of the Roundtable theme.  Developed by Little Wing and published by Success, the same publisher behind all those Cotton games, this game will make you long for those old-school pinball titles.  Possibly the most worthless piece of software yet made for Dreamcast, this is one case where we'd suggest downloading classic titles trough emulation rather than spending your cash to support the Dreamcast cause. Neo Golden Logress features three pinball tables, and for what it's worth, they're pretty well designed.  You'll find numerous ramps and lights to target, and each board features more than just two flippers.  In addition to controlling the flippers, you can also shake the tables either left or right - careful, though, as shaking too hard will result in the notorious ~TILT.~  Too bad the limited control setup makes pushing the flipper button and the shaking buttons at the same time difficult.  Why can't I use the DC triggers as flipper buttons?   One of the strange features of the game is its use of life and skill meters, presented as swords on, respectively, the left and right sides of the screen.  The skill meter rises based on your successful striking of targets.  The life meter depletes with time - if it reaches zero and your ball falls into the gutter, the game ends.  You can continue infinitely, though, with no loss of score.  The question is, will you want to?  Unfortunately, the boards are scaled down to fit from top to bottom on the screen, tilted only slightly into the screen.  They're completely 2D and are drawn in high-res, but unless you have a VGA Adapter, it's difficult to see what's going on.  And if you do have a VGA Adapter, chances are your monitor is too small.  I had to sit real close to the screen, and darnit it's hypocritical stuff like that that keeps little kids from listening to adult folk like myself!  Just for fun, I pulled out the only pinball game in my collection, Virgin's Hyper 3D Pinball (I nabbed it and numerous other Saturn games when Jeff Chen was cleaning out a while back).  It turns out that although the boards in Hyper 3D don't have as much in the way of targets, the fact that the board scrolls up and down adds a bit of intensity to the mix, something that Neo Golden Logress is lacking.  If you don't care for the scrolling, you can switch the game to a pseudo 3D view that resembles a real pinball perspective far better than in Logress.  There's no such multi view capability in Logress, and that's inexplicable considering how much more capable the Dreamcast is compared to the Saturn.  Just imagine how much clearer the pseudo-3D view could be done with the power of Dreamcast behind it. Hyper 3D Pinball also has a lot more going for it in terms of number of tables.  The three tables in Neo Golden Logress get old rather quickly, and playing continuously in order to collect shields and points and whatever else the game throws out is a lesson in boredom.  The game can occasionally be fun, especially when you enter multi-ball mode, where up to four balls appear on-screen at once.  Are these moments worth your cash?  No way, Sue Kim.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend Neo Golden Logress.  It's probably the most technically unimpressive DC game out there - I get the feeling the SH4 and PVRSG are just sitting there growing fat off all the energy pulsing through them.  The sound and voice are garbled, although this adds to the feel of playing a real pinball machine.  Sadly, horrible music comes bundled with the garbled sound.  In short, you'd have to be a videogame pinball death junkie to buy this game.  It almost seems like it was developed by students in a programming class for kids who never played Nintendo.  That's fine, but don't package and sell the resulting product for $39.99!  If you really need a pinball game, either go the emulation route, or head out to your local arcade.  -- Anoop Gantayat, Contributor", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
