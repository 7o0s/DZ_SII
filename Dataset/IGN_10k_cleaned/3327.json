The game was decent but had too many problems to be considered a worthy title.  For the sequel, the reigns have been handed over to Jaleco, who not only developed the game, but also acted as its publisher.  Was the change of hands for the better, or for the worse?  Keep reading.    Features  Unique dual analog control system allows a player to simultaneously maneuver their character in one direction while accurately aiming spells in another direction. More than 32 spells from 4 elementally opposed schools of magic: Fire & Water, Dark & Light. Players can choose to embark on their adventure as Madelyn, the warrior, or Arran, her husband and the hero of the original Nightcaster. Earn style rewards by combining spell and melee attacks. More than 35 unique enemies. 2 player co-op mode. Interactive score that changes based on onscreen events.  Gameplay Nightcaster 2 plays a lot like Gauntlet.  The game is played from a three-fourths overhead view, and you pretty much run around different environments while killing an endless barrage of enemies that are continuously respawning from, well, respawn points.  And also like Gauntlet, the goal of each level is to eventually reach the exit gate.  Normally, this type of scenario could provide either some mindless arcade fun, or even a deeper, richer game experience like say Baldur's Gate, but unfortunately, Nightcaster 2 has a few too many glaring flaws that keep it from being anything close to fun.    Let's talk about the controls first.  One of the touted features of this game is the unique aiming system.  While moving your character with the left analog stick, you can use the right stick to independently move an orb around you 360 degrees.  This is more or less your targeting reticule.  It will determine the direction you shoot a spell (if you have a projectile spell equipped), and if you have a stationary spell equipped, it will be the location the spell is cast.  The concept sounds good on paper, but its execution in the game is frustrating to say the least.  You spend so much time concentrating on aiming correctly that you pay little attention to where your character is running.  Also, when enemies start crowding you, it becomes incredibly difficult to use the orb to kill a group of surrounding enemies.  You do have the option to use one of two melee attacks (light and hard), but these attacks are at best worthless.  They are weak, (even the hard attack) and by the time the animation routine has finished for one attack, you're dead.     Death.  Never before has there been a game that will teach you what it means to die the way that Nightcaster 2 does.  Be prepared to die like there was no tomorrow.  If you're surrounded by enemies, it literally takes only 2 seconds to die, even with a full bar of health.  Actually, make that only with a full bar of health.  Anything less and you'll be dead before you even realize what's happening.  Using the good-for-nothing block function seems to only make you die quicker as you try to defend yourself while getting picked to pieces by enemies on your left, right, and behind you.  By not blocking, at least you can spend your few precious seconds of life trying to actually kill something.  You are given unlimited continues (thank God), but by continuing, you will lose all experience that you have accumulated since your last death.  And if you do choose to continue, you respawn in the exact same situation you died in.  So if you die while surrounded by a ludicrous amount of enemies, get ready to die again because you'll respawn in the exact same location.  Oh, and this is all when the game is on easy.      Another big problem is the fact that there is no onscreen map.  With environments that look the same no matter where you are in the level, it's very easy to become lost and disoriented.  The compass is nugatory, and you'll find yourself relying on the map to figure out which way to go.  The problem is that to access the map, you have enter into another screen.  This going back and forth between the action and the map screen becomes a hassle, and does little to help with the game's immersion.  A much better solution would have been to have maybe a transparent, onscreen map, or at least a pointer that would guide you in the right direction.  Some may see this as taking away from the game's exploratory component, but rest assured that exploring the areas is not all it's cracked up to be.  There are spells to find and enemies to kill, but after playing (and dying) for a substantial amount of time, your first priority will be to find the exit as soon as possible.      Let's see, what else does this game not do right.  Oh, I know: the opposing schools of magic.  Another highly touted feature of the game is the four opposing schools of magic and how you can use one category of spells to defeat enemies of the opposite category.  Again, not a bad idea, but again, poorly implemented.  This feature would be useful if there weren't so many enemies of differing types all attacking you from multiple directions.  Trying to press the left trigger to switch spells while trying to accurately aim and hit the specific enemy you're trying to kill is not exactly what I'd call easy or intuitive.  There are also times when you want to shoot a projectile spell and have to pause the game to equip it - another issue that breaks up the flow of the game.        And how about the enemy AI?  What AI?  Things follow you and attack you and run right into you until they've formed a circle around you from which you cannot escape.  I know this is hack-and-slash type of game, so this is not that big of a deal, but every enemy does the exact same thing regardless of species or school of magic.      Ok, so Nightcaster 2 has two-player co-op.  It has to be decent fun, right?  Ha!  This mode feels entirely tacked-on in every possible way.  Throwing another playable character into the mix while changing nothing else is a surefire way to NOT make a good multi-player experience.  Also, when one character dies, you must wait approximately five seconds to come back in the game.  If your buddy happens to die before you have a chance to come back in the game, the game is over.  Why can't you just continue like any other game?  This sort of logic makes little sense and makes me wonder how this game ever got out of the QA department.  Blah.    Graphics One of Nightcaster 2's few strengths is its graphics.  A lot of the spells produce nice particle effects, and there is some nice bump-mapping and specular lighting.  The fire caves look especially impressive, with its crimson stones and moody lighting.  The game also moves at a relatively brisk framerate, slowing down only in two-player mode, or when there is a significant amount of action onscreen.  If anything, the slowdown can actually help you escape in seemingly hopeless situations.         But not everything is perfect in Nightcaster 2.  First off, some of the character and enemy models are small, silly looking, and animate awkwardly.  It's hard to feel threatened by what looks like an elf riding on Big Bird's back shooting twig-like arrows at you.  Also, while the environments look nice with their sharp and sometimes bump-mapped textures, there is too little diversity within each level.  One corner of the map looks almost identical to another, and there are not enough landmarks to help guide you around.        Sound Why is it that so many games come packaged with generic techno music that is not only heinous, but feels completely detached from game.  Nightcaster 2 is one of many games accused of this crime, and the verdict is out: guilty as charged.  In a game set in a fantasy world, electronic beat music has no place, so why is it there?  It only helps to draw you out of your suspension of disbelief.  Well, that and irritate you.  The same repetitious music runs rampant throughout the game and it's hard to imagine anyone actually wanting to hear it.  Turn it off and do it fast.    The sound effects don't fare much better.  Everything from the enemy's cries to your character's cry (and possibly even the sound of your own crying) seems to be pulled straight from the sound vaults of any random third-tier action-adventure game.  And even the sound quality is not up to par.  Muffled, distant samples make the sound feel like it's hovering above the game rather than being integrated in it.  There's also no support for Dolby Digital sound (though that may be a good thing).  The game's dynamic music is also pretty lame.  All it really does is make the techno music louder when there are enemies onscreen, so don't expect any real music that actually relates to the actions of your characters.  And to top it all off, the voice acting is poor and sounds extremely contrived.  ~Please, do your best to sound mysterious and fantastical, but don't worry if you don't.~      What Nightcaster 2 pretty much boils down to is you running aimlessly around attempting to kill things, while continuously pushing the continue button.  The game's unbalanced gameplay, poor level and game design, and dreadful music all make for an experience that is little better than going to a urologist the day after Christmas.  Fans of the original may find something to like here, but I cannot recommend this game to anyone else.  Instead, why don't you try Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance.  It's a much more satisfying experience.", "date": "Dec 12, 2002"}
