In the case of Star X, Graphic State has created a fully polygonal engine to produce a very Star Fox inspired 3D shooter on the GBA. While we can seriously appreciate the ambition, the team really should have focused on the elements that actually made Star Fox such a great little SNES game, instead of simply mimicking the graphic style. Though it's a definitely a technical feat for the GBA, this game plays horribly. Features 22 missions Password Save Link cable support for four players (Multiple Cartridges) Only for Game Boy Advance  The SNES required an extra cartridge-based microprocessor, known as the Super FX chip, to give the system the ability to calculate a few polygons and scale/rotate individual sprites. The developers of Star X have proven that the Game Boy Advance has a lot more raw horsepower, as the game's 3D engine is generated by good ol' fashioned tight programming code, using the GBA's main processor. The result is a 3D world that can feature around a hundred or so flat-shaded polygons, moving at a relatively smooth clip...smoother and more detailed than what the FX chip generated on the Super NES. It's not the first polygonal engine on the GBA (Tony Hawk 2 prominently featured a 3D skater), but it is the first game to utilize a polygonal engine to create its whole environment.   So, what better way to show off the company's polygonal abilities by creating a game that's similar to one of the SNES' first polygonal games? That's right, Star X attempts to be the Game Boy Advance's Star Fox; even the game's name doesn't try to hide the inspiration (~Let's just hack off a couple letters...new name!~).  Several of Star X's gameplay elements have been lifted from Nintendo and Argonaut's design for the SNES, including the overall concept: an on-rails shooter that takes place in several different worldly locations across the universe. Players will zoom their craft over and through mathematically calculated, geometric terrain, blasting a swarming wave of several different enemy aircraft before they make Swiss cheese out of your ship. At the end of several levels are giant boss craft that you'll have to whittle away to get them to blow up real good. Inspired by Star Fox 64 are 360 degree levels where you'll have to fly in all directions through an enclosed ~arena,~ blasting mines and incoming enemy craft. With the right elements in place, Star X could have been good.  It's just a shame that the designers who looked at Star Fox for inspiration didn't see the elements that actually made that game so successful. Star X has some of the worst ship handling controls possible -- it's nearly impossible to target enemies naturally because the craft overresponds to the digital control pad. You can adjust the speed of the ship's auto-centering, but not the speed of its initial turning, so half the challenge of the game is fighting the controls so that you can actually target the incoming enemies. It's just annoying how weak the controls have been programmed in this shooter. When your ship takes a hit, you'll never know it...the screen doesn't flash, and your ship doesn't shake. The only indication is the power bar at the top of the screen...every hit diminishes that thermometer bar until it vanishes and your ship anticlimactically explodes. And the smart bomb, another element lifted from Star Fox, is so poorly implemented that you have no idea that it was actually launched, other than the bomb's icon disappearing from the HUD.  The game's save method is the cheap way out: password save. But this password records a lot of data, including how many ships you have left, how many smart bombs are in your inventory, how much shield energy your current ship has at the beginning of the level...the more data a password saves, the more characters are involved in spelling out this character string. And with a font that makes the letter G look like the number 6, you're going to jot down the wrong characters. It's inevitable.  On the plus side, the game features four player link play for dogfighting action, but since the game's gameplay is still in place here, it's an absolute pain in the rear end targetting the other players' ships. The game's as frustrating to play against human opponents as it is playing the solo missions. I totally respect Graphic State for attempting a fully 3D game on the Game Boy Advance, and the engine they were able to crank out on the system is somewhat impressive to see running on the system's LCD screen. It does have its fair share of issues, including pop-up and odd collision detection, as well as a ground texture that scrolls faster than the rest of the world, but it runs smoothly with enough polygons to create a believable environment.However, the game they built around this engine is terrible. The gameplay and controls have been implemented so sloppily on the system, it makes me curious if this game shipped way before it was completed. They're obviously using Star Fox for Star X's foundation...so why didn't they take the concept all the way, offering a ship that controls as fluidly as the graphics? This won't be the only polygonal engine on the Game Boy Advance, so I hope that developers working on them realize that the whole ~ooh, neat, 3D~ gimmick isn't enough for a game these days. Star X has that. What it doesn't have is a design that offers that all-important fun factor.", "date": "Apr 18, 2002"}
