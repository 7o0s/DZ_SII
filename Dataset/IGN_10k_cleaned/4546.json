{"name": "Pirate Hunter", "name_review": "Pirate Hunter Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/13/pirate-hunter-review", "text": "Ever since I was a young lad traipsing through the streets of Madrid, I dreamed of reaching the age where my father would let me purchase my very own Galleon, for at that time, I would set sail through the oceans in search of plunder and riches.  Well, not really, but if this dream ever did enter your mind, even in passing, look no further than Pirate Hunter for your entire pirating fulfillment.    It's no wonder that after the massive success of a movie like Pirates of the Caribbean that players and moviegoers alike will be more than eager to take on the role of swashbuckling, sword fighting, and commanding ships on the high seas.  As an emerging sea captain attempting to make a name for yourself and still find room for lots of pillaging and profit, survival in the 16th and 17th century is truly of the fittest.  Starting off at the very bottom of the pirate totem pole, players must work their way up through trade, piracy (no way!), and making a nice fat profit on the side.  One of the interesting features of Pirate Hunter is the ability to purchase 60 different cities spanning four countries:  Spain, the Netherlands, France, and England.  As the game progresses, the player will be given the opportunity to play as each respective country.  With the progression of the game comes an increase in difficulty, as completing given scenarios will unlock new ones.     There are 16 different scenarios which vary in nature.  As a pirate the player will be launching various sieges on towns, bounty hunting notorious pirates, reconnaissance, blockading ports, plundering treasure, and sifting through the remains of various shipwrecks (which may have in fact been caused by you).  Trade plays an integral role in the game, for through the exchange of various commodities the player's wealth can increase drastically.  While there may appear to be variety of alterable gameplay options within each mission, certain nagging constraints detract the player from always enjoying the game.  Some missions are time sensitive, and if they are not completed within the allotted timeframe, the player will be penalized or have to complete the mission again.  Furthermore, the gameplay may get a little stale after completing half a dozen scenarios, despite the consistent change in locale.      Once the player gets into the core of the gameplay, certain things may seem unbalanced, such as the battles between ships.  Often times the battles will seem unfair, for the computer is allowed to have several ships engaged in combat at once, while the player is relegated to their flagship.  Consequently, when the player is engaged in a battle with more than one ship, the game becomes enormously difficult, as the player will undoubtedly succumb to the pressure of being outnumbered.  Conversely, when engaging in small confrontations in a 1v1 nature, wealth will come quickly, as the game almost seems too easy when engaging in fair fights.    The artificial intelligence in the game leaves something to be desired.  While enemies will make full use of the varying types of ammunition to render your ship into a piece of finely tenderized meat, they lack certain strategic initiatives that seem like common sense.  When in large groups, the enemy doesn't truly exploit the advantage of numbers, and just bombards the player with brute force.  Due to the lack of general variety experienced during battles, they can quickly become repetitive, and some players may shy away from confrontation unless deemed necessary for mission completion.      While the notion of being an unrestricted pirate is not only conceivable in theory, but ideal, there are once again constraints set forth by the developers to keep true freedom at bay.  The aforementioned time restriction can be increasingly frustrating as the game progresses, for as the player becomes ever more powerful, the freedom to decide their path seems to get narrower and narrower.     While it may seem like there is little that is redeeming about Pirate Hunter, it is in the opinion of this writer that what the game may lack in depth, it more than makes up for in a quick fix type solution to a gamer's desire to be let loose in such a fantastic world.  The game is very easy to just pick up and play.  The controls are very simple to learn, and the very informative tutorial will launch players into the depths of the pirate world in no time.      The game is very easy to delve into in regards to its interface.  Most options and game statistics are easily accessible, and viewing ship details, such as ships' maximum speed and cannon capacity are viewed with ease.  Menus are simple and are navigated without difficulty.  Upon the successful completion of scenarios, a hall of fame is viewable, where the player's achievements and statistics are displayed.     Graphically, Pirate Hunter is a mixed bag.  There are no full 3D viewpoints, but the combination of 2D and 3D is satisfactory most of the time.  Everything is very crisp, colorful, vibrant and clear at the standard resolution of 1024x768, and if desired, higher resolutions may be selected.  There was no noticeable slowdown on the 1.3 GHz the game was tested on, and generally ran quite smoothly.  The cities are highly detailed and quite attractive, although they lack the realism of a true city as there are no moving people or objects throughout the backdrop.  The pre-rendered backdrops of so many games to date feel a little stale by today's computer game standards, and the general lifelessness of the settings detract from the overall experience.  Out at sea, the overhead views attributed to the game works both practically and aesthetically, as the ships traveling through the rippling water look quite attractive and are fully animated.  The water does seem a little boring at times, appearing flat and lifeless.  The lighting gives life to the sea, ships, and locales to a convincing degree.  However, where the game truly shines in the visual department is during the sea battles.  The smoke particle effects are quite convincing, and as the ships are being rocked back and forth from cannon fire, the sails sway and the crew scurries about the decks.     Aurally, once again, one may have mixed feelings.  As far as sounds effects are concerned, they are generally sparse and uninspired.  The occasional cannon fire, sails waving, water rippling, or attack bells ringing will pierce the general silence experienced during most of the game.  Conversely, the musical score lends a good deal of help to the struggling audio department.  While the score is not epic in nature by any means, its somewhat soothing feel gives the player a sense of being out at sea and generally relaxed (this may sound unusual for a game based on piracy and, in essence, violence, yet the effect is most successful).  The feel of the soundtrack does pay homage to the era in which the game takes place, giving the player a very atmospheric and appropriately accurate experience.  While there is the occasional looping of the score, it is hardly noticeable.      Compared to other strategy games of a similar nature, Pirate Hunter doesn't entirely stand out amongst its strategy competitors.  The game feels like it is more geared to the casual gamer versus a more conventional and traditional strategy gamer.    One may be quick to scoff at the budget pricing on Pirate Hunter and deem it an unworthy title for purchase.  While the game may not be revolutionary or sensational by any means, it still offers a transient bit of fun to be had, and for a relatively modest price.  If you're looking for a game that will pit you in the role of a pirate, with about 5 hours of gameplay, decent graphics, and an enthralling soundtrack, look no further.  But if your desire lies in a game with a great deal of depth, replay value, and longevity, this game may not be your cup of tea.", "date": "Mar 13, 2004"}
