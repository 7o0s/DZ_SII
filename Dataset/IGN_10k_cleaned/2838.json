This doesn't mean that Gun Metal is a terrible game; in fact, the game will more likely than not hold you down until the before mentioned games are released.  However, Gun Metal is plagued by a number of no-no's that restrict the game from being a mech contender instead of a mech pretender.StoryAfter a great battle on the planet Earth, the human-race needed to find new resources.  Helios was a grand planet, and the humans were able to settle down and become happy once again after such a grueling and exhausting battle on Earth.  There was an enemy, though, that remained unnoticed for quite some time.  The resulting battle between the races claimed many lives, hampering the human's chances of survival.However, there was hope in the form of a machine.  Known as the Havoc Suit, the high-powered machine is able to transform from a mech to a jet fighter, making it the ultimate weapon to counter the opposition's heavy armor and high-tech weapons.You are placed behind this heavily armored, high-tech scrap of metal, and with its great firing powers, you are the humans last hope to prevail against the intruding forces.The game has little or no affiliation with the story.  With no cut scenes, the game jumps from level to level, rather than flowing freely and with a purpose.  Instead, Gun Metal is a collection of levels that can be found in any other mech game that are simply 'there' rather than created to further the game's story.GameplayThe gameplay, while not outstanding, does have a certain subconscious gripping effect: once you pick up the control, it is difficult to put it down.  The hand does lose its grip, though.The missions are quite simply boring.  They almost all revolve around protecting a city, a group of vehicles, or some other form of pathetic ex-Earthly that cannot stick up for them self.  And while the competition does come in several waves of attacks that are at times quite difficult, the desire to go honchas first into a swarm of the competition is never fulfilled.  You're always required to sit back, watch your comrades, and doze off while you wait for more attackers to arrive.  Despite the lack of depth to the missions, they are challenging.  The enemies, when they do come, are well armored and required several heavy-duty shots to obliterate them.  Not only that, but also lesser, yet equally as powerful, enemies swarm in with the taste for your blood on their lips.  While the missions may seem  clich, the game's difficulty and the desire to succeed make this game hard to put down.The controls in Gun Metal are a mess.  I found myself reaching around the control is ways that shouldn't be humanly possible.  The triggers are used for the missiles and the primary weapon, the A button is for cycling through weapons, the B is for auto-aiming, the X is jump, and the Y is for transform.  To include the auto-aim was a necessity for this game (which you will find out in the thumb sticks section), but the feature is plagued since it jumps from enemy to enemy faster than a group of underage drinking teen's run from the cops.  It's nearly impossible to kill one object before the next one is locked.  What's even worse about the auto-aim is the placement of the button.  To have on the default setting the auto-aim as one of the controller's major keys only makes the sore thumb stick out even farther.  The controller menu does include five different layouts for the controller, but the difference between them is minimal and with one problem solved, another one arises.The sensitivity on the sticks is also a cause for concern.  A sundial can be used to clock the time it takes to go a full 90 degrees in the Y-direction (in the up/down direction for those not mathematically sound).  This makes the auto-aim essential for success.  However, even the auto-aim has problems, thus making the game that much more frustrating.And to think, all of this could have been avoided by simply putting in a sensitivity feature similarly found in Halo.  Then again, it is unfair to put this games name in the same sentence of such videogame greatness.However, not all is horrendous and appalling in La-La land.  The game does feature some tough competition (even though the controls might be the main reason for this).  The mech is equipped with a wide variety of weapons and all of them will be put to good use throughout your tasks.  The ammunition seems to run out quickly as well, making it a challenge to go from the battle-scene to the warehouse to reload your ammo and restore your life and back to the fight again in time to save your platoon.  And, trust me, you'll need to visit that little revitalizing station more often than you would like.  All of this adds to the fun and challenge of the game.The game features a tough A.I., where it seems that every round of ammunition they use is aimed for the enormous target sign on your head.  Besides the entire competition having an auto-aim feature against you, they are also mounted with heavy armor that requires even a fist full of your high-powered ammunition to stop the beast.  While it would have been nice to include a difficulty setting, the daunting task of completing this game is perfect for the novice/hardcore gamer.The transition of switching from the mech to the fighter is more of a task rather than a luxury.  The mech doesn't immediately respond, rather it stops for a moment, takes a deep breath (don' ask me how), and then finally decides to change to the other form, one step at a time.  This can really hurt you in the middle of battle if you are in a tight situation and you need to evacuate.  Maybe I'm just overreacting, but after playing Robotech, it's hard to appreciate the transformation mode in Gun Metal.   GraphicsThis is probably one of the better features of the game, but even this is plagued by every gamer's mortal enemy: frame drops.The objects in Gun Metal are nicely detailed.  They aren't breathtaking, but they do exhibit the time and dedication put into the skins on all the objects.  There are cracks, rust lines, and other realistic effects found on the buildings, with a metal glow that seems to be found in almost all Xbox games.  The only real knock on detail is found on the ground, where it seems to be under detailed (almost to the extent of Mario 64).  However, the buildings and the machines are not all that bad.The polygon count is lower than one would want, but it is hardly noticeable.  In fact, you'll be spending too much time fighting off the enemies to even notice that some cylindrical objects are not as round as they possibly could be.  However, if you do spend time to look at circles and other shapes, you'll notice that there are several other games that have better looking objects and designs.The lighting effects are almost non-existent.  Rather than making real-time lighting effects, they simply colored in objects to appear to have shadows draped across them.  A prime example of this is found by looking at the ground around buildings at dusk.  The shadows are cast in several directions, but none of them seem to be cast by the sun.  The fires from gun barrels are also really cheesy, often causing me to dry-hack in disgust.The frame rate single handedly knocks the game down a notch.  While it has been improved from the earlier versions we played, the frame rate is still slowed down drastically when the mech enters combat.  At some points, it's almost feels as if you're drunk and everything is slowed down to drunk-man's speed.  Since this is a pet peeve of mine (as it is very similar to lag), this awful act of nature cannot go overlooked.SoundThe soundtrack to Gun Metal is awesome.  The electronic beats offer a trippy feeling with a twist of sounds that one would find in the movie Aliens.  The futuristic sound also binds in metallic sounds that make the music seem almost perfect for the game.  Not only does it have one kick ass sound track, but also there are two other sound tracks.  Racing Tunes and Fighting Mix accompany the default sound track, Gun Metal, to satisfy several types of music lovers.  This is something that you usually find in a racing game and not in a mech fighter; it's a little bonus that could have been overlooked but instead is much appreciated.The sound clips take a back seat to the tunes.  When the mech shoots at a ship, the sound is very weak.  It is supposed to sound like metal hitting metal, but instead it sounds like a howling warning siren.  The overall depth to the sound is weak, but, in the end, the sounds pretty much sound as they are supposed to.The voice acting even sits further back from the sound track.  There is one voice that covers all aspects of the game: briefing, updates, and the congratulations at the end of a mission.  He sounds too stiff and he doesn't sound proper for the role of a high-ranking officer giving a soldier his briefing.  They could have also gone without the occasional complementary in the game.  It almost makes it seem you are a baby taking your first steps rather than an experience pilot.  The worst is when he reminds you to use your missiles; it happens too frequently.Gun Metal isn't strong in any particular area.  However, the gameplay does grab the viewer, making it hard to put down.  However, after I did put the game down, it was hard to pick it back up.  While absorbed in the game, the flaws seemed to not even exist, but when I sat back and took a good look at the overall game, it was nothing to be ga-ga over.  However, this game will satisfy you until the two big mech titles make their way to the Xbox later this year.  If I were in your shoes, I'd rent before I bought.  You might have second thoughts about the game as I did.", "date": "Aug 8, 2002"}
