Boy, I bet we lost half our readers with that title alone. The rest of you are to be congratulated on your erudition, inattention or just plain bull-headedness. The subtitle for today's review is taken from the book that I am writing; a book which no one, not even my father, is ever going to read. Even so, the issue of games that have been migrated from one setting to another or from one medium (or Entertainment Delivery System, as I call it in the book) to another raises a few important issues for reviewers.   For instance: Can a straight port be good if the original game was good? I don't think so. I think a game has to try to take advantage of something unique in the new technology. Otherwise, what's the point? Next: Can a PC offer a comparable level of social satisfaction to a player? Usually not. As a guy who has played the card game with embarrassing regularity, these were the two big issues in my mind when I sat down to review the PC game -- can they add something to the game (or the process of playing the game at least) and can they give me anything like that same sense of enjoyment I used to get making fun of Tal's Witch Hunter deck? The answers are ~yes~ and ~not really.~   Alright, so now we're getting to the real evaluation. But before we go any further, I should tell the two of you out there that haven't heard of the game just what it's all about. Magic: The Gathering is a card-based wizard duel. You and one or opponents each have a deck of cards that contains land, spells and creatures (which are just a special type of spell). At the beginning of your turn, you draw a card, place land on the table, and use the land to cast spells and summon creatures. The goal is to eliminate the other player in two out of three matches and there are countless strategies you can employ, both in the construction of your deck and the way you use it in the matches. The cards themselves are seemingly endlessly varied and this is what gives this game its collectible, quirky status.   Magic The Gathering Online is a great realization of almost the entire tabletop experience and even goes as far as to smooth out a few of the inconveniences inherent in the physical card game while adding a few other new features all its own. But (you just knew the ~but~ was coming) the facelessness of your opponents gives the game a detached feeling -- which is good or bad depending on how much you want to actually interact with people. That plus the added expense of starting all over again with your collection tend to make the experience less attractive to veterans of the game than it might be to newcomers.   The necessity or attractiveness of board game translations to the PC is well illustrated by the first such titles to crossover -- wargames. When the first computer wargames started coming out, they were filling three main needs among the wargame community. First, they provided you way to set up the battle of Arnhem, and go grab some lunch without worrying that your cat was going to eat the 1st Airborne Division. They also provided a convenient tool for doing the math and keeping the often confusing turn sequences straight. But most importantly (depending on how hungry your cat was, I suppose) they provided you with an opponent, always ready to play at your convenience.   MTG Online has all three of these down solid. Setup is a breeze and the initial distaste I felt from not actually being able to spread all my cards out on the floor has almost completely given way to admiration for the ease with which you can create and analyze decks. The interface consists of your deck window and your collection window. You merely have to drag a card from one window to the other to add it or remove it from the deck. Specific filters and numerous sorting options make finding the right type of card pretty easy -- assuming you have it.   There's also a deck analysis tool that tells you how your card ratios work out -- from mana cost to color to likelihood of being drawn in a given turn of the game. The information's quite easy to read and can save you from being short on a particular land type or being overloaded with high-cost spells. I'd have liked to see a similar tool for post-game analysis, or even one that rated the effectiveness of the various cards, but the flexible nature of the deck constructor would make this less meaningful in the long run. The deck analysis tool will let you know what formats your deck is legal in and which cards make it ineligible if it's not legal. (Games for more dedicated players often limit the series from which you can construct your decks.)   You can save any number decks you constructed, along with accompanying sideboards (a 15-card reserve that you can trade out with other cards in your hand after the first and second game of each match). Perhaps the greatest of all the game's features, and I say that only half-kiddingly, is that you can use the same cards in more than one deck. Since each deck is built from your entire collection, you won't have to keep transferring your Jokalhaups from one deck to another.   The adjudication and resolution within the actual matches is quite convenient. You simply tap cards to activate their abilities. For the most part it's straightforward and you'll find all the functionality simply by clicking on the card itself. The game once confused me by forcing me to play an ability of a card already on the table out of a separate pop-up menu. Luckily, situations like this are as rare as they are counterintuitive and you can usually do everything you need to do with a few clicks of the mouse and dragging the cards where they would normally be played on the table.   The graphics for this portion of the game -- the game part, I guess -- are really true to the Magic experience. The card art is a big star here, as it is in the tabletop version. The drawings and nifty text are all intact and really easy to appreciate. The table itself can get kind of cluttered though and some of the cards, of necessity, get shrunk down to too small a size. Thankfully you can point to any card to bring up a larger, readable version of it in the top left of the interface.   I've been screwed because I thought I was clicking okay for the end of my opponent's turn, when I was really clicking okay to end my own pre-combat phase. I know it sounds like I'm an idiot who has to have his bus number pinned to his jacket, but trust me; you click a lot of OK windows in either turn. There's also a small issue with the inflexibility of the phases and I've missed out on certain abilities or turns because the pacing of the game wasn't clear. When you're playing socially with other people, there's more slack in the phases.    On that social note, we come to the third side of the game, which in some ways gives even more of a mixed impression than the mechanics of play. On the plus side, there's a good competition going on at all times and there's never been any wait for a game. Everyone I've met since has been an earnest and sportsperson-like competitor. And the fact that you can log on and play six different people in the space of two hours keeps you on your toes. On the negative side you really feel at too great a distance from your opponent.   You meet them all in the lobby in one of two formats. Either as a big list of games or in this completely useless isometric view of a giant card room. The thing is so huge and the scrolling so sticky that I can't ever imagine looking for a game here. While it doesn't have as much character, I prefer the list of available games to be shown spreadsheet style. There's a general chat in the lobby and you can open up private chat windows to specific players. (Obscenities are blanked out, so the worst you'll ever see is, ~Don't ever                untap my                creatures, you           -brained mother-             !~ Big thanks to Soulstice for teaching me how to get around this with words like Da5^it, whatever the          that means.)   The chat in the duels themselves is pretty weak. One simply line, real tiny at the bottom of the screen -- you really almost miss it. All that ever shows up there other than that are the text cues for the plays being made on the table. A larger chat window might encourage more conversation.    Once you've cut your teeth on the game's nearly limitless single-player duels, you can move on to games with up to six players. These range from simple free-for-alls and team battles to more sophisticated games like Emperor and Giant. Emperor, for six players, is a two-team game. Each team is trying to kill the enemy sitting in the middle of his teammates but you can only attack players who are seated next to you. Giant lumps all of a team's health into one pool and restricts you to attacking the enemy directly across the table. Both these games are fun but the added downtime of so many other turns tends to emphasize the anonymous nature of the game.   After that, there are the league and tournament games. Leagues begin with a starter deck and two boosters and you get to add a new booster every week. The winner at the end gets a fabulous prize. Tournament play affects you rating. Each player has a Magic rating of 1600 to being with and every time they win a match, their rating increases, more if they beat a higher rated opponent, less if a lower. Since these ratings are recognized by Wizards of the Coast, they count for something in the offline world as well.   There's an almost unbeatable set of references that you can access during the matches (and most other times besides). Although I couldn't ever find the explanation of Fear (see: Tal, living with), it's really useful to be able to click on a term like Regeneration or Madness and find out just how it works while you're in the middle of a match.   The game includes the latest Seventh Edition cards, as well as the latest add-ons: Apocalypse, Invasion, Judgemnet, Odyssey, Planeshift and Torment. The cards are purchased (ching! ching!) at an online store. You can get cards in small booster packs of 15 or starter decks of 60. The boosters are $3.29 and the starters are from $8 to $10 each. Many people are wary of spending lots of money on the cards that online exist online, especially since I've seen the same boosters and starters on sale at the comic and gaming stores here for as much as a dollar cheaper. By the same token, I have lots of cards I spent hundreds of dollars on that are worth about three bucks now because of the all the updated editions. Check out the awesome bid on this thousand card set.   The cost of the cards, and the attachment I have to those I first started playing with, honestly put me off this game somewhat. Call me a baby, but I miss my Giant Growths and Lava Bursts, worthless as they are from a financial standpoint. But there are plenty of great new cards that work well in groups. The lack of dupes is an issue that can be remedied by simply buying enough new cards of course, so anyone who's willing to start investing in a hobby like this will definitely be rewarded with cool card combinations and extra copies of their favorite cards.   All of your cards are stored in an online binder and are hard-grouped by series. You can come here to check up on which cards you have in which sets and which ones you need. Perhaps the best feature of this binder is the ability to sort by rarity. This becomes more important once you start trading. The more rare a card is, the more people want it, it seems.  After a while, as you're looking for more specific cards, you'll explore the game's trading options. You set a card's trading status in the collection binder and then either proceed to the trading floor or make a direct player-to-player trade on your own.    What did you think of Magic: The Gathering Online? In the end, the fact that the game is only $13 and you get some cards to start, means that even if you don't like it, you're not out that much. (You can also just download the software for free and buy your own cards.) And if you spend the other thirty or forty bucks you'd spend on another game, you'll have a pretty decent collection of cards. And then if you spend the ten or twelve bucks for your other MMO game on this, you can keep adding to your collection. I imagine Wizards of the Coast know that the people who are going to be buying cards in this game are probably the same people who've already spent lots of money on the physical card game. It's the nature of collection, after all.I enjoyed playing Magic: The Gathering Online. It's fun and really true to the series. Having said that, I probably won't play it too much longer, mostly because it just whet my appetite for some face-to-face play. While it's a good game, I guess Magic Online just comes across as somewhat redundant. It has some notable conveniences but the extra cost to buy cards and the somewhat impersonal nature of the interface kind of cancel out the advantages, leaving Magic: The Gathering Online firmly in the ~pretty okay~ department.Here's the bottom line. If you like Magic, you'll like Magic: Online. If you don't know if you like Magic but this sounds interesting to you, it doesn't cost a lot to try it out. It does start to get pricey if you want to get competitive or even just want a little more variety in your decks.", "date": "Jul 3, 2002"}
