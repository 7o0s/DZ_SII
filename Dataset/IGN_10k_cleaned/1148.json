Though most companies haven't given the machine much -- if any -- support, SNK's newest buddies at Capcom (who also allowed the amazing SNK vs. Capcom titles) have ported over a new Mega Man compilation.   Rockman Battle and Fighters is based on two obscure Japanese arcade games that used the Street Fighter II hardware, and never saw release on a home console. Both Rockman Battle and Rockman Fighters are fighting games, but with a twist: instead of following the standard Capcom fighter formula, both games are expanded versions of the Mega Man boss encounters. Never thought you'd have to take on Elecman, Diveman and Cutman all in one fell swoop, eh?  Features Complete conversions of two arcade games Four playable characters Over a dozen bosses and special weapons Link Cable support Compatible with both Color and Monochrome Neo Geo Pocket systems   Both games use the same basic gameplay engine. Rockman Battle lets you play as Rockman [known here as Mega Man], Blues, or Forte, while Rockman Fighters adds the massive Duo to the cast.  After choosing your character, you can select from one of three courses, which determines the lineup of bad guys you'll encounter.  From there on in, it's time to battle. And don't expect the typical Capcom or SNK-style fighting controls, either  this is classic Megaman gameplay. As it was and ever shall be, your character can dash left or right, jump into the air, or fire his weapon. You must learn each boss's attack pattern, dodge his projectiles, and exploit his weakness. The game is essentially one boss encounter after the next, and it works surprisingly well -- it's a good deal less tedious than the average handheld fighting game.  When selecting your enemies, choose carefully -- after you beat each boss, you acquire their special attack, which can be put to use in the next round. You'll eventually figure out which weapon can be best put to use against your foes, and structure the fights accordingly. Best of all, there are a ton of enemies to fight here  I'm not sure if the game includes the entire Mega Man Evil Boss Roster, but if not, it certainly comes close.   There's one little problem -- after each round, your power level doesn't recharge all the way. If you happen to die, you can continue at full strength -- minus any special weapons that you acquired. The game makes up for it by introducing Rush Dog and various other robotic helpers for an extra dosage of firepower (and without a touch of slowdown, either).  The game has been nicely scaled down from Capcom's CPS1 and CPS2 arcade hardware, and really takes advantage of the NGPC's graphics abilities. The animation quality is easily on the level of the Super Nintendo, and the backgrounds have a lovely, hand-painted look. One stage features the combatants on a floating platform that bobs up and down, and another is on the back of a rotating platform flying through a computer matrix.   Musically, the game features the same driving beats as the rest of the games in Capcom's Megaman canon, but the songs tend to repeat a bit more than I'd prefer  and the only digitized sound in the game is Megaman screaming ~ROCKMAN, BATTURU ANDO FIGHTAZU!~ at the title screen.  Unfortunately, the game isn't particularly importer-friendly  though it runs on American systems (which are universal, anyway), setting your system to ~English~ does nothing. The game is entirely in Japanese, except for the message ~YOU GOT NEW WEAPON NAPALM BOMB~ after each round.  Also, the link cable support isn't too solid. After clearing different courses, you unlock a Robot Database that gives information on your enemies. It's possible to link up to another NGPC unit and give the database info to a friend, but there's no one-on-one battling between clients. Bummer.  But aside from that, Rockman Battle and Fighters is a fresh take on the fighting-game genre, and provides a nice diversion from SNK's large lineup of mostly similar brawlers. If you're still interested in picking up NGPC games, this is definitely a top title to import. I really enjoyed this one. Boss encounters have always been one of the big perks of the Mega Man series, and porting over not one, but two arcade games in the same package was a stroke of good fortune. I wish there was a little more to do with the link cable, but this is a fine little action game for one of the best ~dead~ portable game systems out there.", "date": "Aug 8, 2000"}
