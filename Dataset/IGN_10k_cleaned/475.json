{"name": "Amerzone", "name_review": "Amerzone", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/02/amerzone", "text": "In the wake of several other recent graphic adventures, Ubi Soft throws their effort into the choppy waters.  Amerzone is a four-CD adventure detailing an expedition to a far away island in order to return the egg of a endangered, not to mention semi-mythical, species of birds to its rightful place.  The egg isn't exactly your standard Sunday morning omelet variety though, this sucker looks like it came straight from Jurassic Park.  Tragically, despite the somewhat noble story of saving this mythical creature, there are a few flaws present here which detract from the formula that games like this simply must follow.  Delving into the ~impressive~ foldout CD liner (grrr), there is unfortunately no mention of plot.  In fact, no background details at all -- not even so much as the name of your character can be found in the poor documentation offered here.  So, after taking a few seconds to read this so called manual in its entirety, nothing is left to do but leap blindly into the game itself.  The journey starts with a conversation between your character, ~the journalist,~ and an old mailman. It seems you are on your way to a house that the mailman has just recently come from. He asks if you would mind taking the letter he left in the mailbox directly in to the owner of the house. It seems the owner is quite old and can't get around too well.  The mail carrier then goes along his merry way and the game transfers quite smoothly into the general interface.   Things look familiar here, showing a static screen with a cursor at the center.  Upon moving the mouse however, viewers are treated to a truly beautiful full range of 360-degree movement.  Every aspect of your surroundings can be looked upon from your point of view.  Sadly, these lush environments can only be viewed from certain fixed vantagepoints, as Amerzone suffers the same type of slideshow progression that plagues other games in this genre.  After seeking out the old man, an ex-explorer, in the house ahead, listening to his story, and then rummaging through his personal things, our still nameless hero receives his quest.  The old adventurer was originally a scientist who set out to the Amerzone in search of the mysterious white bird native to that region.  Proving the existence of these animals was apparently very important to him, and he ultimately discovered one of the white bird eggs.  On a more fascinating note, you learn that these incredible birds are born, live, and die in the sky without ever landing.  Apparently this particular egg was not born with the benefit of the wings with which all other white bird eggs are blessed.  Anyway, after removing the gargantuan egg from its home environment and returning with it to the scientific community, the old scientist was ridiculd by his peers and the egg  was dismissed as nothing more than a large ostrich egg.  Some years later, the old man is struck with a sudden crisis of conscience and charges you, a mild mannered reporter, with the responsibility of returning the artifact to its place of origin.  For some reason -- which is totally beyond me -- you decide to do away with all other aspects of your life and undertake this quest for which you are completely unqualified.  Such is the life of the modern newsman I suppose.  Gameplay in Amerzone, as you might expect, revolves heavily around visiting each location in the game and scouring it for some odd item that will undoubtedly find some use in other locations.  After acquiring such items, it's just a matter of finding exactly what needs to be clicked on with each different piece of equipment in hand.  Don't worry about being bogged down with too many things though, since there are only eight inventory slots available from the onset of the adventure.  As is true with many other titles of this type, your character is somehow blessed with the knowledge of whether or not a particular item will be needed later.  Thus, once something has been utilized for the final time, it is magically whisked away to the abyss of the suddenly insignificant  This has honestly become something to expect in graphic adventures, but I find it entertaining nonetheless.  However, nothing generates interest in Amerzone as much as the Hydroflot.  This amazing device has the ability to transform itself into several different forms (plane, sailing ship, submarine, etc.) to better accommodate your travel needs.  Tragically, even this modern wonder has some troubles.  Upon entering the craft, a gas check ensures that there's enough fuel to reach the stated destination.  However, after setting out to the blue skies, you fall short of the mark from a lack of fuel and crash into the ocean. You then deploy the sailing function of the Hydroflot and progress towards your destination.  Unfortunately, there isn't enough wind to traverse the entire distance.  At this point, you should be effectively stranded, but it seems the submarine function needs no fuel whatsoever, even though it requires the use of the same wind fan which propels the craft when in plane formation.  Interesting, to say the least.  The one saving grace of this title is its movie presentations.  The video here is of a very high quality, with a sharp level of detail.  The music is also quite engaging and creates a real sense of awe and adventure.  Unfortunately, the music shines through only on certain isolated occasions and the rest of the game suffers from its absence. It's truly a pity, since the graphics are really quite nice and would be complemented well by a more complete soundtrack.  Ultimately, Amerzone slides into the cold, widening embrace of mediocrity. It offers the typical gameplay with some solid visuals and an infrequent, above-average musical score.  However, the lack of a solid story and an array of gameplay inconsistencies make this adventure a bit more frustrating than it really should be.  Thus, the egg would probably be better scrambled, and the Amerzone better left a mystery.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Dec 2, 1999"}
