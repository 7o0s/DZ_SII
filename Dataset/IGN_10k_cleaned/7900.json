Notice the lack of any numbers after the game title? That's right - it's the first in what is sure to become an ongoing franchise. In our gaming world of endless sequels, it's refreshing to be introduced to an entirely new set of characters, inhabiting a world we haven't already saved from destruction seventeen times.   Considering the game is introducing a brand new world and storyline, the plot could have been a little clearer. In fact, it's about as clear as driving through a blizzard on a moonless night. Having said that, by remaining so light on the details, it opens up a myriad of questions that a sequel will no doubt explore.    The central protagonist is a bloke with the very un-heroic name of Wayne. That's right, Wayne. No, seriously, Wayne. Wayne is on a stereotypical quest to avenge the death of his father, who was crushed by a giant slug called Green Eye, yadda, yadda, yadda. Throw in some snow pirates, an evil corporation by the name of NEVEC and a cute love interest, and the result is a fairly standard sci-fi scenario with the expected twists and turns.   Lost Planet's world is E.D.N. III, an icy hellhole that was apparently the closest substitute to Earth humanity could find. This ice-block of a planet makes Siberia look positively balmy. While the story is a little bizarre, the cutscenes through which it's told are nothing less than spectacular. Capcom know how to make gorgeous cinematic pieces, and it's outdone itself in this game. Using the in-game engine, these scenes amply display the power of Lost Planet's graphics engine to flex its muscles when the camera is up close and personal, with immaculate detail and character animations. The fact that the sci-fi costumes of the characters are so darn sexy doesn't hurt proceedings either. The delivery of the story-building dialogue leaves something to be desired though, with pauses in all the wrong places and some rather tedious lines. One hug-o-rific scene in particular was especially vomit-worthy.    Thankfully it's easy to forget the so-so storyline when you blow your first Akrid into bug-dust. Lost Planet is an all-guns-blazing celebration of old-school shooters, delivering overwhelming action in a way that rekindles the glory days of destroying screen-filling swarms within Gauntlet. It shares the same basic formula for action as Dead Rising, Capcom's other recent 360 action title. Wave upon wave of mindless enemies are followed regularly by very unique and occasionally frustrating boss fights.    One angry bug needing a truck-load of Mortein.  The onscreen bullet-bonanza is displayed from a third person perspective, but Capcom has tweaked the standard camera controls to deliver a mechanic that usually succeeds, but occasionally loses its footing on the game's icy slopes. It differs from the normal third person camera, as the crosshair has a little bit of play. You can move it a little bit in any direction before the camera viewpoint follows. It's tricky to explain - thankfully it's not tricky to get used to.    The system doesn't really offer improved control over what we're used to, but it does introduce one minor drawback. Turning takes longer than we're used to. When you're surrounded in all directions by dozens of flying bugs, who all want to feast on your torso, it's a bit sluggish. To counter this, the bumper buttons turn the player in 90 degree increments. These work when you remember to use them, but to be honest we rarely did. It's also a little strange that the controls don't allow you to look directly up. Kudos to Capcom for trying something different, but in the end it unnecessarily overcomplicates the controls, though not to the point where it's painful.    Opening up the levels, which are already impressively vast, is the inclusion of a grapple. Provided it's within reach, the x button will shoot the grapple out to nearby ledges, hauling Wayne's butt up to a better vantage point. It's a cool little gimmick that could have been exploited even more in the level design. It really comes into its own in the multiplayer though, where height equals power, and levels are as high as they are wide.    While most enemies have the intelligence of a gimp, their sheer size and number never fails to impress. You'll face off against dozens of Starship Trooper-inspired Akrid bugs at any one time, and once they're cleared super-roaches the size of small buildings will emerge from the ground. At the end of most levels are Capcom's trademark boss battles and they make the super-roaches look tiny. While the bosses can initially be head-buttingly frustrating, launching rocket barrages that continually pound you into the ground with no time to recover, once you've figured out their behaviour pattern, and how to use obstacles in the arena to avoid them, they're quite simple to beat.    VS suits make a big showing in the last half of the game.  About halfway through Lost Planet, things start to get a bit repetitive as the game hits a pacing hump. We were getting a little sick of the snowy environs and the endless waves of bugs, and the game was heading towards mediocre territory. Thankfully it's around here that the action takes a step in a different direction, with a new focus on the game's Vital Suits and an accompanying ramping up of the carnage. Vital Suits are small mech-suits, delivering whopping amounts of firepower while remaining relatively agile. For the last half of the game you'll be increasingly reliant on the various VSs to make it past the larger Akrid and tougher NEVEC mechs. There's a nice variety of VSs, some focusing on mobility, while others are all about delivering a face full of rockets.    The level design changes up nicely over the course of the game, while the range of enemy types is varied, not to mention creative. The Akrid and NEVEC baddies stand out as being exceptionally fun to destroy. However, you'll probably clock the game in about seven hours. We're happy to pay this much for a ten hour experience, but seven hours is pushing it, and severely compromises the overall score.    The gas burner things keep you warm. Lose too much heat and you'll die.  For those with Xbox Live, the multiplayer will add significantly to the longevity. While it's no Rainbow Six: Vegas, sixteen player team matches require a level of strategy not seen in the single-player game. Having said that, it's still quite a twitch-based game, with a healthy mix between pure action and light tactics. Splitting the sixteen players into four teams results in pure chaos, so most games that we played were based around two teams. The standard variety of game types are included, including deathmatch, team deathmatch, hunter (one guy is the target for all others) and a few others - obviously with Lost Planetified names though.   During our online testing, most of our opponents (and their servers) were based in Japan, as the game had already been released there. Surprisingly then, lag was quite bearable, although a little bit of warping was evident. A ping meter to each server is not present, so finding local servers is going to be a pain in the ass when it hits our shores. Note to developers of Xbox Live titles - ALWAYS include a ping metre in your server browser, dumbasses. We don't all live in the US you know! With bushfires raging on our city outskirts, and 40C days on the near horizon, what better way to escape Australias oppressive summer than to dip into a game set on a planet designed for polar bears? Capcoms latest icy treat is heavy on the snow, gunfire and enemies, and offers enough variety and action to keep your trigger finger satisfied. Its not quite perfect, with the length of the title being a major concern as well as a few pacing issues, but its a fine first entry for this new series. Lost Planet will frost up Aussie Xbox 360s on the 12th of January. If you've read our review and deemed it worthy of the wallet, let us know what you think of the game.", "date": "Jan 11, 2007"}
