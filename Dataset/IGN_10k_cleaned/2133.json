{"name": "Tang Tang", "name_review": "Tang Tang", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/27/tang-tang", "text": "I'm all for old-school titles on the Game Boy Advance with a simple pick-up-and-play design and dozens of levels, but there's something about Tang Tang that just doesn't feel like a complete package. In the game, play through a design that's extremely similiar to Tecmo's own Solomon's Key (released last year on the Game Boy Color as Monster Rancher Explorer). The game by Take 2 and GameVisions, though, is very bland graphically and gameplay-wise, and it's hard to justify a purchase when there's a similar GBC version already out there at a cheaper price with more things to do. Features 120 levels 24 worlds Four playable characters Battery save (flawed) Only for Game Boy Advance  Players control one of four Bomberman ripoffs (it doesn't matter which one you choose) in a challenge of 120 levels (kind of...it's really only 30 with four different enemy locations) that require both thought and action skills -- the task is to collect the coins in each room, but to do that, you have to plant boxes in order to jump up and reach them. The character can also remove these boxes as long as he's standing right next to them (or under them). But you'll have to keep track of the enemies that wander around the room -- some can be blocked by a box structure, but others can only be deflected with a crate. Once all the coins in the room have been collected, a door opens up that'll take you to the next round. Every five levels you'll duke it out with a boss that you'll have to take out with your normally-limited firing abilities.  The game doesn't have the same feel as Monster Rancher Explorer, simply due to the fact that its structure doesn't retain that ~one more time~ element after you get yourself killed. Why? Because if you die in a level, the round doesn't reset -- you start with a fresh character and finish off what you left over before you died. The sense of conserving players gets thrown out the window, even though you'll need every single one to advance through all of the levels in the game. Odd how that works, but it's true. The lack of gameplay variety doesn't help this game along either -- it'd be great to be able to create your own puzzles (like Monster Rancher Explorer has). This is an expensive cartridge at almost forty bucks, and there's not much here that makes the package feel complete.  And the weirdest thing? Tang Tang has a battery save inside the cartridge...and it even has a ~Continue Game~ option when you turn on the system. But this menu selection doesn't do a darn thing. ~Continue Game~ sends you right back to the first level of the first world. Even stranger, selecting ~New Game~ brings up a warning that it'll delete the save game in progress. The only thing I can see the battery saving is the high score table...so why is there a ~Continue Game~ option? Tang Tang's graphics and presentation are barely on par with PC shareware games of the early VGA days, let alone hardly up to snuff with the rest of the offerings on Game Boy Advance. Musically, though, the game rocks -- the development team went to Shin'en for the sound driver and tunes, and these guys really know how to milk the Game Boy Advance's hardware for excellent audio quality. The challenge is there, but it's not really a whole lot of fun...especially when you realize that you can't return to later levels after the game's over without playing through the earlier levels again. That ~Continue Game~ bug is really infuriating. This game feels ~empty~ due to the lack of variety...just because it has a lot of levels doesn't mean there's a lot to do in this game.", "date": "Sep 27, 2001"}
