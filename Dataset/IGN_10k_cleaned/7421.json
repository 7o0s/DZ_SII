Without doubt, Triple Play 2000 for PlayStation is a fine baseball game, serving up tons of features and goodies mixed with a strong gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, the Nintendo 64 title of the same name lacks nearly all of the added extras that make its PlayStation counterpart so good. In fact, it looks as if EA contracted developer Trey Arch to mesh last year's game with this year's, shrink everything into medium resolution mode and remove any options that might be storage-space heavy. The end result is a game that, while not entirely bad, is a far cry from extraordinary.   The Facts   Major League Baseball and MLBPA licenses for all the teams and players.

Rumble Pak support.   Gameplay Triple Play 2000 for Nintendo 64 feels very much like a cross between this year's PlayStation game and Triple Play 99. Elements from both incarnations of the popular franchise have found their way into the N64 version. The mechanics are simple enough; Batting is done using the analog stick in conjunction with the A and B buttons, depending on where a player wants to hit the ball and the desired power they want to hit the ball with. There is no batter's box to worry about (as seen in Ken Griffey and All-Star Baseball, which may or may not appeal to gamers. Instead, the idea is to time oncoming pitches just right, determine power and direction with the analog stick and corresponding buttons, and slam away. Pitches, meanwhile, are selected with the four camera buttons and thrown using a hybrid of the A button and analog stick. It's all very standard stuff, lending itself to gamers who aren't interested in learning curves.   The game might be described as an arcade take on the sport, except it moves at the pace of a simulation baseball game. What we mean by this is that the batting/pitching drags along, comparable only to the speed of last year's All-Star Baseball '99. Players can speed the game up, but all this really does is boost animation routines, which serves to make the experience that much more awkward looking.  The traditional options and features baseball fans have come to expect of all games based on America's favorite pastime are included. This means full statistic-tracking, real teams, players and stadiums; A Team Management mode for trades, signs and create-a-player; Multiple gameplay modes including Single Player, Home Run Challenge, Season and Playoffs. While the extras aren't endless, there are enough to satisfy most everyone.  As we said before, nothing is bad -- only average. You won't find the options and simulation-esque feel of All-Star Baseball, nor will you be treated to the arcade thrills, spills and pace of Ken Griffey Baseball. The gameplay -- decidedly average -- fits snugly between the two, comparatively superior baseball offerings. Finally, what's up with load-times?   Graphics Something went terribly wrong here. Maybe developer Trey Arch had nearly wrapped up work on the N64 incarnation of Triple Play 2000 when it got the call from EA Sports saying that the game absolutely had to have a better resolution. Or maybe not. Either way, the game's visuals suffered greatly in the end. Employing a medium-resolution mode, the graphics in Triple Play 2000 don't look crisp and sharp as one might expect. Rather, the game appears to be smushed into medium-resolution mode, with no care or thought of the ensuing warp effect on visuals. Everything, from players to stadiums, doesn't look quite right. Even the text, which has been shrunk down significantly, is almost too small to read.  Unfortunately, that's not the worst of it. Colors are washed out and somehow, despite the game's resolution, everything has a fuzzy look about it. Animation, while not horrible, is jittery and sometimes players run at lighting-fast speeds for no apparent reason (best demonstrated before and after innings). To top everything off, the game's framerate isn't half as good as All-Star Baseball 2000, a title that looks literally 10 times better.   On the bright side, stadiums and players are nicely modeled and nothing looks particularly bad. Also, lots of cinematic camera angles -- from different shots of batters taking the plate to home run blasts -- highlight the action. If you're expecting a game that will be able to compete visually with the likes of All-Star or even last year's version of Ken Griffey baseball, though, you're in for a disappointment.  Sound The sound effects in Triple Play 2000 are actually very well-executed. Unlike the nonexistent background noise in All-Star Baseball, Triple Play constantly captures the sounds of baseball. Music plays over stadium loudspeakers, fans boo and cheer and play-by-play calls are top, though oddly, unlike any other Triple Play game, there is only one commentator. Even the crack of the bat sounds great when players snap a ball deep into the outfield. Triple Play 2000 is a very average baseball game. There really is no better way to describe the experience. This fact is made all the more painful by the quality of the PlayStation game of the same name. One truly wonders why EA would shun off a second-rate quasi-port of last year's game onto Nintendo 64 owners while PlayStation junkies get the cream of the crop. It's really too bad.From the game's forced medium-resolution mode to its jerky animation routines, it simply cannot compare to the likes of Ken Griffey or especially All-Star Baseball in terms of visuals. Similarly, it's not nearly the arcade baseballer that Griffey, nor is it the baseball simulation of All-Star.Unless you're absolutely dying for a fresh baseball experience on your Nintendo 64, I honestly can't recommend Triple Play 2000 as an alternative to Griffey or All-Star. Please EA, give Nintendo 64 owners something more than last year's PlayStation game with added glitz", "date": "Mar 24, 1999"}
