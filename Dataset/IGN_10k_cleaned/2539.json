There's a big difference between console and PC RPGs. Not only in gameplay, but in depth, story, and art. It's probably actually easy to consider the two types to be different genres at times with no better argument than Grandia II from Game Arts and Ubi Soft. This game is not like a PC RPG. It's light. It's fluffy. It's colorful. It's not exactly deep. Its storyline is console stereotypical. Its jokes are silly. Its gameplay is cartoony. And the characters all have huge eyes and no mouths. But it still manages to be fun, maybe even just because it's so different than most of the dark, dreary and serious RPGs that find their ways to our favorite platform. It's that light and fluffy style and attitude that somehow keeps you wrapped up and at arms length at the same time. All of that being said, Grandia II has its merits, but I've played better console RPGs than this.The main reason I say I've played better before is that Grandia II is relatively simple even by console standards. The story is predictable enough that you'll just be playing the game to make sure that you figured it all out in the first five minutes of the story. Grandia II falls into the melting pot of console RPG  clichs on more than just a few occasions such as treasure boxes and strange items being left on ledges everywhere for no reason. At least it has a light-hearted enough approach so that it can make fun of itself all the same. Take for example some of the wisecracks from the main character about how stereotypical many of the characters actions and game's situations are. A small example, but you should get the idea. Still, even with the jokes, things are quite cheeky enough to really be able to save a pretty pathetic story.There's actually quite a bit of goofy and dorky humor throughout the game that folks with bad senses of humor like me will really enjoy. I felt like I should have added another piece of tape to the nosebridge of my glasses every time I laughed. Although I'm not sure I was really laughing with the game or at it. But whatever... as long as I'm entertained, right? It's hard not to laugh along with the regular lineup of heroes and sidekicks. You've got the wisecracking 17-year-old hero with a chip on his shoulder that can cut through monsters with ease. You've got the 17-year-old love interest for the hero playing the gentle soul that will change the hero into a better person by the end of the game. You've got the 13-year-old ambiguous boy/girl that somehow can also kick the crap out of monsters and sling magic around despite the fact that he/she hasn't actually had the privilege of arriving in the land of puberty quite yet. And you've got the big burly animal/man character that happens to be a little wiser and philosophically inclined than the rest of the group even though he also finds an exquisite type of pleasure from hacking living things into itty bitty pieces. Then of course you've got your religious zealot type and your ultimate evil type who also happens to be related to our main character and your kind old leader type that instantly recognizes the good in even the roughest of people. You know the cast. You've seen it before. They may have had different names and different looks, but they're still the same for the most part. There are a couple of surprises in the game... but nothing spectacular.The gameplay is also kind of a mixed bag for me. But let's start with the positive. Those that have seen Grandia games before will know it, but this was my first time really getting into it, that the combat system is really kind of a kick. Game Arts managed to the normal console RPG fighting system of  ~character gets a turn and either attacks, casts, or uses an item and then waits till his initiative climbs again till it's his turn again~ and make it visually interesting and much more strategically dynamic. You've got your choices of attacks and magic, but now you also have to take into consideration the position of the various players on the battlefield. The combat is based in a 3D battlefield where your characters will have to run up to an enemy to attack them. If they can't reach the enemy before they run out of movement points, they're crap out of luck. While that wasn't the greatest explanation in the world, what it does do is create a whole lot of movement on the battlefield instead of a static fight where both parties stay on their sides while the outcome is slowly hammered out.There's even the option to turn your entire party, or individuals in your party, over to the computer so you don't have to worry about them. There's several different AI's depending on what you'd like the characters to do for any general situation. This actually allows you to sit back and never do a thing in battle, but honestly, I never really liked their solutions, so I kept the control to myself. Unfortunately, doing that makes the game pretty easy. I can't say I ever actually felt the stress of coming close to dying the entire time I played the game. if it was somehow just a little more challenging...    One section of the gameplay that I'm still riding the fence about comes from the skill system. Basically, each of the characters has some special moves that they can use. You can pump these up in power. These three or four moves are the only character specific skills that you can get. The others are given by assigning general skills to the various characters. So if you want a magic skill in one of your typically melee based characters you can do that. The trade off is that the system is pretty shallow compared to many of the RPGs we're all used to playing on the PC. There's only so much you can do with the system and character roles tend to blur a little bit because of it.I'll tell you what's not blurry (segue! segue!), the graphics, that's what. Oh wait... some of them are blurry. Particularly the FMV cutscenes and spell animations. Blech. But let's not speak of those anymore. If you can disregard them (which I can't entirely), the rest of the game is very playful and charming. The few animations characters have are okay, but there isn't anything all that extraordinary in this department. Colors are vibrant, monsters and characters are cool and cartoony all at the same time, and some of the effects are really nice. Models and the model textures all look like much prettier versions of any of the console RPGs we're used to from the days of SNES and the Saturn. They're sharp and pretty and done fairly well. At the same time, some of the environments are downright flat and blah. It's strange, you're in a horribly boring cave or forest setting, and then all of the sudden, you're running around in an interesting town and really fancy cathedral and you wonder what happened... Why was there no detail in the adventure maps? Why only detail in the cities? It's a little disappointing. Now having said that, I'm going to backtrack a little and contradict myself a little bit. While I mentioned that the towns were interesting, I guess I really meant they were more interesting than the other environments... There have been several other RPG's where I've been excited to get into a new city to find new quests and explore for stuff and immerse myself in a little different society. The towns in this game were all constructed pretty similarly so there wasn't much exploring needed, and no extra tasks or quests to complete inside the main storyline. While it was fun to see some of the detail and imagination in the towns, they didn't give me that same feeling of being away on a grand adventure.The sound, similarly, is not very good. In fact, when you're running through the world, it's almost like taking part in some strange silent film. You've got the music in the background, and the subtitles for most of the speech, and then these horrible sound effects for footfalls and doors opening. But there's no background noise. There's no hustle and bustle in the street. No one else's steps make any noise. I think I heard a bird squawk once... but that might have just been my intellectual pet bird reverting to his roots for all I know. It's like you're walking through a dead zone half the time. So when the voice-overs finally kick in every now and again, it's surprising and a welcome relief. Well, most of the time anyway... The voices are all done fairly well for the genre and the style, which of course lends itself to a certain range of corniness. These voice actors definitely went to Japan's Over-The-Top School of Anime Voice Acting. But still they can be pretty entertaining and hold a certain charm that comes with the territory.Likewise, the music fits into the typical anime/console RPG category with pseudo techno/rock/new age stuff floating around trying its best to drive me crazy. While it didn't succeed in driving me crazy, it didn't exactly impress me either. I'd love to see one of these games with a decent soundtrack for once that isn't so freaking cheesy. Someone needs to grab Air and get them to do a game soundtrack... Now that would put some atmosphere into the mix.Sure, the Grandia II is a little corny when it comes to the story and many of the gameplay elements, but the battle system is cool enough and the characters (as stereotypical as they are) likeable enough that it was still a pleasure to play. Fans of the genre that haven't already played the game probably won't be disappointed unless they're some kind of crazy anime Dave console RPG Smith snob...I'm not going to say that my experience with Grandia II was bad. It certainly wasn't. I actually enjoyed it. But I'm also not going to say this is the best game ever like our former Dreamcast editors that must have had sexual relations with the game somewhere along the line to give it such a high score. But those that have been looking for a good console RPG to break up the dreary RPGs and endless amounts of FPSs and RTSs on the PC, you could certainly do a lot worse than this game. It's fun. It's not the best thing ever, but it has enough charm, cuteness, and campiness to at least put a smile on your face and give you an easy 20 hours of gaming.", "date": "Mar 8, 2002"}
