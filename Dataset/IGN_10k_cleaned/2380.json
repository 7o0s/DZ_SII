Who cares about why Homer's painted the family wagon with signs and decided to make a little side money by giving people a cheap alternative to Burn's new -- and probably deadly -- radioactive bus system? That's the motto of the game, for good or for worse.  Road Rage is an action game, so action in fact that the plot isn't even a worry... only the money matters. Like a certain other game involving cars, arrows, time limits, colored rings, passengers, destructible environments, insanely fast handbraking and quick quips, Road Rage is as simple as you can possibly get. Taxi around passengers in a crazy fashion, make money, and unlock new levels and cars, all while enjoying the faint tire smell that is Springfield.  Gameplay Pick up a passenger, and follow the arrow at the top of the screen. Drive over, around or through everything in your way, and drop them off at the right location, with a bonus for speed. You'll get a few more seconds on your clock every time you drop a passenger off, with the ultimate goal to rack up the highest score before your time runs out. You can learn the basics in 30 seconds, and get right to the gaming. You won't even have to learn the town, or follow a map... just slam through shortcuts and follow the arrow, and you'll be fine. That's the best part about the game, and its biggest fault. The pacing is fast, and it's as simple as Pac-Man to get into and master. Unfortunately, since you're constantly running back and forth through town, with little new to explore, you'll begin to feel more like a shuttle service that a dangerous, death-defying taxi service. The level design, which is more focused on humor than on gameplay, is also too spread out to serve a challenge, not to mention the fact that the cars drive a bit too slow to get you worried.  For those of you worried about, say, a challenge, Road Rage alleviates that stress completely by allowing you to unlock extra cars (there are a ton of them, from Grandpa's Shriner mobile and Marge's SUV to Krusty's clown car) or new sections of Springfield like the Dam and the Entertainment district though point totals. Every game you play adds to the total, and certain point limits gain you your choice of a new level or car to mess around with. The only difference between playing badly and playing well is the ability to unlock new items faster. If there was a variety to how you played the game this might be more of an incentive, but you'll find the game quickly becoming repetitive, even when you unlock new areas of Springfield.  There's an extra mode that gives you challenges to conquer, like hitting 12 annoying mascots in a certain time limit, knocking over lamp posts with Otto, or driving Homer to work with Bart, but their gone so quickly, and there are so few of them total that you'll be finished with them before you've even realized they've begun. The game itself is as simple as it sounds, with the only real change in unlocking new levels and cars. Different vehicles deliver a variety of driving experiences, but since the game's light on realism (for good reason), the driving styles are more frosting than a key ingredient.  The levels are where the charm lie, whether it's checking out Truckasaurus at the stadium or giving yourself a tour of the Kwik-E-Mart. Unfortunately this is a game, not a sightseeing tour, so while you'll be chuckling and laughing for a couple of hours, you'll quickly become bored once you realize that the game itself lacks any sort of depth to keep you interested enough to unlock all the characters in the game.  Graphics How do you make a game based on the Simpsons without making it look a bit, well, flat? It's tough, and while Radical does a great job of filling the game with pretty much every landmark ever mentioned in the series, it's still a pretty simplistic affair. Cars are made of a handful of polygons, and building are flat, one color affairs.   Games like Cel Damage have proven that you can still have a cartoony look while still adding more detail and lighting effects to the environment, however. Environments can still be simple without being feeling washed out. While Road Rage manages to deliver really nice detail in the player's cars themselves, the actual locations and objects are simple enough to make you think you're playing PlayStation port with cleaned up textures. Unfortunately, the physics don't help much either. While it's great to smash the world up, everything has the same reaction -- a mailbox floats and flips through the air the same way a billboard, a tree, and a fence do, making the carnage less satisfying. Crazy Taxi did a great job of creating some fantastic destruction without slowing down your Taxi too much, while Road Rage seems to sacrifice detail for overall speed.  The great, fantastic, incredible part about Road Rage -- and depending on how much you love the Simpsons, this could make the above criticism moot -- is its slavish devotion to delivering every detail of Springfield to the game. Every sign, every business, every movie theater marquee and object is a reference to a bit of Simpsons history, like a 3D encyclopedia of pop culture. The Sunday Drive option of the game is a must have addition, if for nothing else than to give you the time to discover all the jokes hidden away in the corners of each area. Virtual Springfield, a game devoted to putting you into the town, didn't even come close to delivering the density of Road Rage.  Sound The music in Road Rage... who cares about the music? Yes it's nice, it's solid, it's got the Simpsons feel without annoying you on repeated play -- but the voices! That's what you're here for, that's what you've shelled out your money for. The game uses all new dialogue from nearly every character in the game, and like the Simpsons toys, they also react with one another. Pick up Moe with Marge, and you'll hear him apologize for ~trying to hit on you that one time, Midge.~ Bart will have unique conversation with Homer, different from his reaction to his mom, or Lisa, and so on. You'll want to unlock the new vehicles as much to hear the new dialogue as you will to race around in Homer's Mr. Plow vehicle, or Apu's butt-rockin' sports car. This doesn't always work as well as it should, and you'll end up hearing repetition fairly quickly -- but give me a little of Simpsons for a landfill full of awkward videogame voice acting any day. Road Rage is exactly like Crazy Taxi, though without the fine tuning and sweaty stress. It's a simple game, without the challenge or the depth of the game it clearly apes, but of course, with many more jokes about alcoholism and emotional abuse. The appeal of the game comes in the license, and I mean that sincerely. While the gameplay isn't going to grab you, your Simpsons geekiness will be totally fulfilled in the amazing detail given to the tons of referenced jokes and buildings from over a decade of the show. Match that will real interaction between the characters from the show, using all-new dialogue, and you've got yourself one of the most interactive Simpsons reference sets ever. Of course, this is actually a game... which you'll remember once the fun of visiting Springfield wears off. The gameplay won't keep you interested, and the challenge is pretty minimal at best, no to mention incredibly repetitive. Crazy Taxi managed to pull this off, but Road Rage is left sucking down the fumes of Sega's original creation.", "date": "Dec 12, 2001"}
