Who wouldn't want to take some of the most exotic cars in the world and race them through cities like Monaco, Rome, and LA?  Add in the ability to style your car in almost any way imaginable and to build up its racing stats as you win races, and you have the makings of what could be a great game.  Unfortunately, despite the great concepts Supercar Street Challenge falls flat in almost every place that it could have been spectacular.  The gameplay follows the tried and true console method of doing well in races to unlock new tracks, styles, and extra points you can spend on upgrading your car's speed, brakes, acceleration and handling.  This sounds interesting and challenging until you realize that you can win pretty much every race the first time you play it.  There's no need to really familiarize yourself with a track; yeah there are some shortcuts you could take but they're not necessary to win.  Playing the game just doesn't take much skill, and ends up not being very fun.  The few courses that are difficult are not so because the track design requires some thinking and planning, but only because there are obstacles strewn in the middle of the track that you have to pray you miss -- because if you hit them even once (pretty darn hard not to do) they completely stop your car and you have to back up to go around them.  This is not what I'd call difficult; this is what I'd call frustrating.  There are no simulation elements to appeal to hard-core driving fans, and while I'm the first to enjoy a good arcade racing game there just isn't any sort of fun factor to make it worthwhile.  Let's take a look at the cars, which are probably the most alluring part of the game.  You can choose from cars like the Lotus M220, the Rinspeed E-go Rocket, the Callaway C12 and the Fioravanti F100, which do look pretty cool.  You can also create your own car, blending different fronts and backs and customizing accessories like wings, headlights and even mirror placements.  How you style your car has absolutely no effect on its performance, though, and while it's fun to play with for a while it doesn't really add much to the game.  You'll also find that after you've played for half an hour and fully upgraded your custom car it's much more powerful than the cars that are built into the game, so it's a bit of a letdown to drive any of them.  You can also change the stat distributions and style of your custom car at any time, so you won't play it over again to make a car with different character; you can just change your first one.  The graphics in the game are pretty solid.  They're crisp and clean with good shadowing, reflections, and antialiasing -- though you'll need a very good system to get an acceptable framerate at high resolutions (especially with some of the particle effects and rain).  There were also occasional clipping problems with the car when run at high resolution.  While the cars look good the tracks can be mediocre, with hokey or generic looking scenery and textures at times.  It often feels like you're just racing a track with some trees and buildings thrown in as scenery rather than flying through the middle of a real metropolis.  A lot of racing games depend on sound to bring the game to life.  Hearing your car rumble and whine can give you the feeling of being on the track as well as giving you instant feedback on your racing.  In SSC the sound is very unspectacular; the normal racing sound effects are there but seem pretty flat, and the music soundtrack is a techno-ish mix that gets annoying after a while.  The music doesn't noticeably change according to which course you're racing either, despite the plethora of interesting cities and cultures to base the music on.  The interface for the game works, but shows its console roots.  It feels like you've got a memory card rather than a hard drive, and you have to manually save your progress after each race.  This means you can easily go a few races without remembering to save, and if your system crashes (mine crashed twice in an hour but then seemed to settle down) then you've lost all the goodies you unlocked.  When entering high scores and car names there's a console-like on-screen keyboard, but luckily you can still just type out names on your regular keyboard.  The only multiplayer mode is a head-to-head split screen mode, and you'll need a gamepad for one of the players.  It would have been nice to see a mode where you could play other people on the net, and might have breathed a bit of life into the gameplay.  It's too bad to see what could have been an addictive and excellent game not deliver.  The graphics are there, the cars are cool, and it's got a great concept.  But you just won't get a lot of fun out of driving these cars around, and there are a lot of better racing options for either the arcade player or the enthusiast. -- Niki Kittur      Want to share your opinions with the world?
