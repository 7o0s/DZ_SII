{"name": "Airline Tycoon Deluxe", "name_review": "Airline Tycoon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/21/airline-tycoon", "text": "Have you ever asked yourself, ~Gee, I wonder what it would be like to run an airline?~ Chances are, you probably haven't. Then again, you probably never wondered what it would be like to operate a theme park or a railroad, either. Yet somehow, the recent slew of ~tycoon games~ have been selling almost as well as if they had the words ~Baldur's~ and ~Gate~ in their titles. Perhaps that's because somewhere deep down inside (hidden from everybody else, I'm sure) many of us lust after the notion of being inconceivably rich. Playing at being rich is as old as Monopoly; furthermore, there's a certain glamour associated with being a big, industrial-strength mogul. That's why you don't see too many games out there like ~Diaper Tycoon~ or ~Hairless Cat Tycoon.~Developed by Spellbound Software and published by Monte Cristo Multimedia, Airline Tycoon is the latest entry in this soon-to-be-saturated sub-genre. In recent years, Monte Cristo has created some small buzz with an innovative line of ~management games~ either developed or published by them, including titles such as Wall Street Trader 2000, Economic War, and Start-Up 2000. Following the lead of those games and titles such as Tom Clancy's Ruthless.com and Roller Coaster Tycoon (and averting its eyes from the disastrous Airport Tycoon), Airline Tycoon puts you in charge of one of four fledgling airlines-Sunshine Airways, Falcon Lines, Phoenix Travel, or Honey Airlines.The game offers two relatively short campaigns and a free-play game, all of which require that you master a wide variety of tasks in order to nurture your two-plane upstart into a minor empire. Many of the tasks are straightforward, such as hiring flight staff and advisors, bidding on and obtaining branch offices in other cities, and assigning regular routes in addition to irregularly scheduled independent flights (which carry higher premiums). Other tasks, such as managing your stocks and improving your airline's image, involve multiple factors and are decidedly more complex.When you start Airline Tycoon for the first time, you'll immediately notice that the designers held to the tenet they outlined in the game's manual: ~Airline Tycoon is an economy simulation that you should not take too seriously and that does not claim to be realistic.~ That said, this ~not too serious~ sim rewards armchair CEOs with a surprising amount of depth despite its managerial simplifications and cartoonish interface.In both the campaign and free-play modes, you'll start off each day by meeting with the airport manager, a cigar-chomping Ed Asner type named Dr. Uhrig. In your first session with him, he discusses your mission tasks. All subsequent meetings with Dr. Uhrig serve as progress updates to inform you on how well you're doing in relation to your competition. Dr. Uhrig works relatively well as a motivating device-he comments on your image and the quality of your planes and flight staff, barking out the perfunctory ~You're an example to us all~ or ~Good, but could be better~-but Spellbound wouldn't have detracted from Airline Tycoon's playful atmosphere by making Dr. Uhrig more informative or even open to general inquiries or requests for suggestions.After the required morning meeting, you're free to conduct your schedule as you please. The airport, where your office resides, is laid it out in side-scrolling fashion, with each of your option categories set up as various shops. Most of your time will be spent running back and forth between the Last Minute Counter and the Air Travel Center, where you'll pick up flights to schedule for your individual airplanes. To minimize the amount of running around you have to do, you can pick up a notebook PC and a cordless phone at the Duty Free Shop. These clever tools will let you access all your plane information and flight schedules and call your various competitors or your branches to pick up additional flights from anywhere in the airport. (Time is money in this game; you'll often find yourself racing your competitors to snag that last remaining million-dollar flight).You can also visit the Museum to choose a retired plane to put back into service, the Petrol Air Counter to purchase oil and oil barrels at the going rate, or the Newspaper Stand to do God only knows what. Other stops include the Workshop, the Cargo Office (based on your planes' carrying capacity, you can transport cargo for extra bucks), Rick's Cafe (for some dispensable advice), the Bank, and in some missions, the NASA Office (to purchase parts for that time-honored tradition, the game-ending race to space).On the upper level, in addition to your office and the offices of Dr. Uhrig and your competitors, you'll find the Plane Dealer, where you can buy new planes, and the Advertising Agency, where you can purchase various ad campaigns to spread the good word about the world's best new airline. Each airline also has a Personnel Office, where the hiring, wage setting, and firing of flight attendants, pilots, and advisors takes place. Most of these airport locations contain one or two fully voiced animated characters-many of whom are distinctive in appearance and stereotypically appropriate for their line of work (such as an Arab at Petrol Air and a lush at Rick's Caf).I could tell that Spellbound spent a good deal of effort incorporating the advisor system, because there are so many of them and all of them are designed to benefit you in different ways. Some of the advisors are worthy investments, such as the Security Manager (bodyguard), who gets you discounts with every big purchase, and the Personnel Advisor, who points out when some of your job applicants aren't all they're cracked up to be. But for the most part, these advisors don't help out as much as they should. The manual and the tutorial portion of the game (a pop-up assistant named Belinda) both practically implore you to purchase the services of an Order Advisor, for instance, but this advisor hardly ever tells you anything you couldn't figure out on your own after playing the game for half an hour. In fact, many of the advisors point out the obvious instead of cluing you in to some helpful secrets the way the Personnel Advisor seems to do.This lack of authoritative input (for the sake of making informed decisions) marks Airline Tycoon's only major shortcoming. The manual is adequate when it comes to interface-related matters, but it generally avoids going into detail about possible strategies or even what the meanings or implications of some of the more obscure options are. For instance, in the bank you can speak with two different characters to access a variety of options, such as purchasing shares, issuing shares, taking out and repaying loans, and setting dividend amounts. But with the exception of taking out and repaying loans, I couldn't figure out what I would stand to gain or lose by utilizing these features. I had gotten the impression somewhere along the way that setting a dividend amount would affect my image (which, in turn, would affect a number of other factors in the game that defined my bottom line), but beyond that I had no idea how to figure out what a good dividend amount would be. Such conundrums presented themselves in some of the other areas, as well, including the Plane Dealer (How can I afford new planes, and why should I bother to buy them when the planes available in the Museum work just as well?), the Petrol Air Counter (How much fuel is enough, and what's a good price in general?), and the Workshop (What's the difference between requesting immediate repairs and requesting routine maintenance?).Even though I had to stumble through multiple attempts at some of the tougher missions as a direct result of the poor help system, I still want to give Airline Tycoon good marks for striving to be as unique as possible. As previously discussed, most of the game's locations and services are richly layered, with surface-level features opening up to additional features. One example is your office. From there you can customize your planes, arrange their schedules, and determine from where they'll get their fuel. You can also make the same phone calls your cell phone makes available, and check your inbox, which, like the Newsstand, has no impact on the game. Unfortunately, due to the game's fast pace and your competitors' cutthroat nature, you'll rarely feel like you have time to explore all your options.One of the especially neat elements that Spellbound threw in is the placement of various ~story~ items throughout the different locations. You can buy a violin case at the Duty Free Shop, for example, and give it to the man at Petrol Air in exchange for access to a secret room in which you'll find an airport terrorist who will sabotage your competitors and their planes for the right price. Many of these items are off the wall (sometimes literally) and it's a lot of fun to seek out their ~rightful owners~ and find out what use they have for the items.Usually, a game is good when you don't have to force yourself to play. Airline Tycoon started out for me like that, with its oh-so-many variables tied so neatly together. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was more to this title than the 1980s-throwback music and art stylings implied. Its premise might not be realistic, but Airline Tycoon nevertheless requires you to balance a number of engaging managerial decisions that come off as a representative sampling of what you might experience as a real-life corporate manager after all. However, almost every game out there does have an ~I can't take it anymore~ point; unfortunately, because of the limited assistance you get for learning how to utilize the many robust features, that point comes sooner than later in Airline Tycoon.-- Gil Alexander ShifWant to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Feb 21, 2001"}
