It's not that I don't like RTS games and it's not that I'm not into the modern military content. What I am against are games that don't work as they ought to. There's no denying that Will of Steel started with a good idea, but it just never seems to come together.  You play as a young Marine officer named William Steel (get it? Will of Steel?) who's leading forces against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though there's a slight narrative running through the campaign, the story itself is incidental to the action. There are some ties between the individual missions but, at the end of the day, it's enough to know that you'll be leading a Marine battalion into a variety of small-scale fights in primarily urban locations.   In terms of infantry, you'll lead riflemen, snipers, medics, rangers and a variety of special forces into these battles. They'll be supplemented with plenty of recon vehicles, tanks and helicopters. The Marine arsenal even includes vehicles like the Bradley and Apache which I'm pretty sure are used by the US Army, not the Marines. The forces arrayed against you will have similar equipment but they'll beat you with quantity rather than quality. Success in battle requires careful management of all of your units.  You'll need to take care of every single unit you get because there's no base-building or recruitment in Will of Steel. There are scripted reinforcements from time to time in some of the missions but, for the most part, you'll have to make do with the forces you have at the beginning of each mission. Thankfully, you won't ever have to control more than a few dozen units at a time. Units can be set in a variety of engagement modes and formations. While the different behaviors are useful, I wish the formations included a variable facing option. As it is, the formation will face in whatever direction the camera is facing.  Someone really dropped the ball with regard to the game's pathfinding. It's absolutely the worst part of the game and I can't believe that the developers and publishers weren't aware of this problem before the game shipped. Grouped units get hung up on each other with almost every move order. Other units get stuck in areas of the map and can't seem to find their way around, say, a parked car. As if to make up for this some units actually move on their own without any input from you. Watching your precious engineers wander out into the road all by themselves will have you digging through the trash to find your receipt.   Even though your units show considerable initiative in rushing out into the enemy's line of fire, your engineers and medics can't seem to get it together enough to heal your infantry or repair your vehicles on their own. They also won't disarm mines without express orders. To be fair, the medics will heal themselves automatically, but having to micromanage the healing and repair of every single unit in your force is just tedious and (hopefully) not the point of the game.   Perhaps as a way of compensating for the frustration of managing this aspect of the game, when your engineers repair destroyed enemy vehicles, you can use them immediately without having to send new crews in. Presumably your engineers also resurrect and convert the destroyed tank's drivers and gunners to your side. It's a convenient feature but it tends to undermine the game's attempts at realism.  In terms of realism, you'll find that your units are more vulnerable to weapons fire than in games like C&C Generals, for instance. A few hits are sufficient to take out most of your units so you'll want to seek out every advantage you can get in terms of maneuvering. Though the engagement distances seem fine, the fog of war doesn't extend far enough. Your units and those of the enemy can see farther than the fog of war would indicate. It's not unusual to see your units firing at a target that you can't even see yet. If your units can see it and they can fire at it, why in the world can't we see it?      Mission design is pretty straightforward. There's usually a limited set of objectives in the game and they can be accomplished within about ten minutes if you stay focused. There definitely needs to be some way to check your objectives during the mission. As you progress through the missions, you'll have access to a greater variety of special abilities like calling in air strikes or revealing areas through satellite reconnaissance.  The camera allows a bit of freedom when viewing the action but the tilt and zoom functions could be more extreme at either end of the spectrum. I'd like to get in close to the action almost as much as I'd like to be able to pull back and see the overall strategic situation.  I quite like the game's graphics. The individual soldiers and vehicles are well-rendered and have lively animations. Seeing your soldiers drop to the ground when under fire is a particularly nice touch. Though some of the desert environments are a little monotonous, the urban locations in the game are full of details. The buildings are all very distinctive and the placement of other objects like cars, crates, streetlamps, etc. definitely enhance the realism of the setting.  The lighting effects are particularly good. Playing on a level with lots of thunder flashes is especially thrilling. Weapon effects are also handled well. The tracer effect of small arms fire is subtle but easily readable. More impressive are the explosions from the big guns. The flash and smoke and fire effects you see when you light up an enemy tank really brings the combat to life.  Though the graphics are good, the game doesn't seem to run that well, even on a system that's well above the minimum specifications for the game. The framerate is terrible, even at 800x600. The stuttering performance isn't helped by the mouse latency. Too often trying to grab units or rotate the camera become their own little frustrating mini-games of their own.  We've been told that these performance problems are the result of bad copy protection on press review copies. The retail version of the game shouldn't suffer from these problems but we haven't been able to test the boxed version of the game on a variety of systems. Even if the performance problems have been addressed, the game still has some significant weaknesses in the area of gameplay.   One final note: Will of Steel comes with a new voice control feature that lets you command your forces using simple words and phrases. Say ~soldiers~ for instance and the game will select all your soldiers. Say ~guard~ or ~column formation~ and they'll take the appropriate action. Though it's an awesome idea, I could never really get it to work properly. Sometimes asking for ~circle formation~ would instead select all my tanks. Asking for ~tanks~ would often result in the selection of all my medics. I really like the idea here but there are obviously some major kinks to work out of the system.There aren't too many modern era RTS games but we certainly don't need one like Will of Steel. Though there are some good concepts and admirable intentions here, the game just seems unfinished. Performance issues aside, the horrible pathfinding, sticky interface and bizarre line of sight problems all point to a game that was rushed out too early. Gamers intent on playing a modern RTS may persevere in spite of these problems but with Act of War coming out soon, you're better off waiting.", "date": "Feb 2, 2005"}
