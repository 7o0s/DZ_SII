{"name": "Aerial Strike: Low Altitude -- High Stakes", "name_review": "Aerial Strike", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/16/aerial-strike", "text": "Though my Saitek X45 gets quite a workout from all the flight sims I play, I also enjoy the occasional non-traditional flight game. Games like Descent, Echelon and, yes, even Flying Heroes provide me with a nice change of pace in between sessions of IL-2 Sturmovik and Warbirds. I was pretty happy then to get a chance to play through Dreamcatcher's Aerial Strike.  The new game offers a futuristic take of dogfighting by placing the player in the cockpit of a high-tech ship. You play as a freelancer who finds himself thrust into the middle of a 22-mission story involving competing factions or pirates and mercenaries. Through the course of the game you'll have to make assaults on enemy bases, intercept incoming ships, seek out missing pilots and a host of other activities.  While it's a great concept for a game, there are a few problems Aerial Strike that will keep you from enjoying the things the game manages to get right. First and foremost, the control scheme for your ship is just plain awkward. There are two modes of flight here -- jet and hover -- and neither work really well. The two modes are definitely different enough and each is useful under different circumstances but you'll still feel like you're fighting more against the controls than against your enemies.  That fancy new flight stick I have might as well be a simple three-axis joystick for all the good it does me. The throttle control is useless. Engaging jet mode simply propels your ship forward at its maximum speed. Being able to throttle back a bit to wax the tail of your enemy would definitely make for a more exciting experience. It would also be nice to use the joystick to control the propulsion of your craft in hover mode as well. Instead you have to use the standard WASD setup to move around.  The responsiveness is a bit odd as well. You can set dead zones for the joystick but you can't set the sensitivity. It would be better if the inputs ramped up, offering small adjustments nearer dead center, with extreme movements coming more towards the edges of the input. Even with monkeying with the dead zone, the inputs were still too tight making it hard to line up shots on enemies zipping through the air.   As if in recognition of this difficulty, the game includes a generous auto-aim feature. You can pretty much be assured of hitting an enemy as long as they're anywhere near the center of your HUD. While it makes the game a little less challenging, it goes too far. You can dial down the aiming help but then the problems of the oversensitive controls rise up to compensate.  Given the cool weapon pods that are attached to your ship, it would have been especially neat if you could customize your ships, switching components in or out as needed. There are some pick-ups you can get in the missions themselves, but these basically add more ammunition to your weapons or give you a one-time speed boost. These pick-ups are handled pretty realistically; you have to stop over them and use a crane to draw them up into your ship. It's a pretty simple and painless process and preferable to the more gamey convention of just having to fly through them.  I've been really impressed with the game's graphics. The ship designs are really original and full of the types of details that make them seem realistic. Aerodynamically speaking, they look pretty ridiculous, but the small fighters and the floating airships are all really cool to look at. There are lots of cool missile pods and thrusters and moving panels that add a sense of life and animation to the ships as well. This is something the ships definitely need given the hopelessly static chase camera. The seagoing ships are cool too. The giant aircraft carriers and battleships look like something out of an old 1980s issue of Popular Mechanics. Rad, as the kids say.  The environments aren't quite as good as the ships but they still manage to get the job done. The massive islands you'll be fighting over have loads of interesting features and enough vegetation to help give you a sense of speed when you're flying down low. The water effects are very believable with lots of small waves and cool reflections.  It's really satisfying to watch your opponents start to trail smoke when you're pouring fire into them. The disintegration effects when you eventually destroy them are also very fulfilling. Though the explosions and smoke effects from your damaged enemies are well done, the actual weapon effects leave a lot to be desired. They just don't sell the effect of bolts of energy slamming into your opponents or missiles flying through the air.  The voice acting is pretty low budget. The actors seem a little flat throughout the entire game and some of the dialogue is just awkward. Consider this exchange: Pilot: Thanks for your help, freelancer, but we can deal with this. You: Oh, you do, do you? What the hell is that? There are a few other instances like where the dialogue simply jolts you out of the game.  Perhaps the most annoying thing about the voice acting is that the cast includes just about every accent you can think of. We see this all too often in video games and I really can't account for it. I guess it's easier to just use a Jamaican or Spanish or Chinese accent instead of coming up with a character with real personality. It's nice that the world of Aerial Strike is so cosmopolitan but it just winds up being distracting.  The sound effects are just as flat as the voice acting. You don't really get the oomph you need from the weapons. Firing off the napalm cannon or a volley of missiles leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. Though the music is pretty good, it's so laid back that you'll have to pay special attention to it just to notice that it's there.  If the game's single player action isn't enough for you, you can head online and try some human competition. There are ten levels here and six different ship types to choose from. That's pretty good as far as variety goes but the lack of an in-game server browser means that pretty much no one will play this game online. It's a shame because online play might have increased the appeal of the game overall.Aerial Strike could have been so much more than it turned out to be. The idea is great and the graphics are definitely competitive in today's market. The main problem is that the control scheme is just too awkward. Managing the two flying modes and dealing with the thrust issues are enough to make dogfighting more than just a little clumsy. Since mixing it up with the other ships is the whole point of the game, this limitation definitely hampers the enjoyment you might otherwise experience.", "date": "Feb 16, 2005"}
