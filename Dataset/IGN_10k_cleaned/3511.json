{"name": "Vigilante 8", "name_review": "Vigilante 8", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/06/04/vigilante-8-4", "text": "Twisted Metal, move over - there's a new king of the road. Building on the funkadelic universe of Interstate '76, Activision's Vigilante 8 takes PlayStation auto-combat to the proverbial ~next level~. But it's not without flaws.  Thanks to a top-notch 3D engine, the game delivers highly-detailed visuals and vast, fully-destructible, combat environments - not to mention some truly eye-popping special effects and reflection-mapping. In other words, it looks great and offers unprecedented depth for a game of its type.   On a technical level, the game's physics engine is second to none. Each vehicle has its own working suspension that bobs and bounces across hills, and each shows several stages of visible damage.  Hidden secrets are also a major part of each stage - you'll spend hours just uncovering every nook and cranny. And once you do, you'll gain a sizable advantage on the competition.  Car variety and weapon selection are remarkable; there truly is a setup for every style of gamer. The fact that you can see which weapons your foes are carrying adds a great deal of strategy to multiplayer.  As for competitive play, Vigilante 8's is some of the best to be found on PlayStation. Due to the sheer size of the maps, matches are guaranteed to be lengthy, and strategic hiding places are plenty. There's also a two-player coop mode where players can go head-to-head against any number of CPU foes as a team.  On the downside, the game could have been better in two respects. First off, the control is a little too floaty. It's not horrible, to say the least, but it does take a good deal of getting used to. Secondly, the ability to do a 180 degree braking spin would have been a welcome addition; turning to face foes is often a overly-lengthy procedure.  When all is said and done, Vigilante 8 proves to be the best auto-based combat game yet on PlayStation. So if you loved the Twisted Metal series, or simply hunger for a well-done blast-a-thon, you'll definitely want to give it a spin.  --Randy Nelson I was really excited to finally stick in Vigilante 8 in my Game Boy Color, just to see how well it was converted over from its rather cool PlayStation incarnation to the portable screen. They got some things right (the speech is excellent, and the graphics are nice), but the conversion is very sterile. I really miss being able to blow up tanks and buildings  instead, it's just a straightforward Combat-style game with very few options. It isn't bad, but don't go expecting that much out of it.", "date": "Jun 4, 1998"}
