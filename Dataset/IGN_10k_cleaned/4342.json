Probably the better question is, how could you not? The creepy hallways, the gliding chairs, the crystal ball, and all of the ghosts -- the popular attraction has frightened children and entertained adults for decades. And now the ride has come to life on the silver screen and on your home videogame system.  The good news is that the videogame version of Haunted Mansion is in fact not based on the disappointing Eddie Murphy movie of the same name, but rather on the attraction that started it all. As a result, it's a little creepier and slightly more true to the original material. While the title can offer up some disappointingly repetitive objectives, there are still some smart puzzles interspersed and control is relatively tight. This isn't the deepest adventure title ever created, but Disney fans will probably like its ~spirit.~  The Facts  3D adventure based on Disney's Haunted Mansion thrill ride Explore a dark, creepy mansion inhabited by ghosts Control character Zeke Halloway and run, jump, fight and climb as you attempt to rid the mansion of evil spirits Capture 999 ghosts throughout the mansion Solve 24 unique puzzles Features a dozen enemies and 20-plus ghosts recognizable from the ride   Gameplay The Haunted Mansion takes place in the 1890s and introduces players to Zeke Halloway, a skinny aspiring author in search of a job -- any job. It's this latter problem that brings the character to a dark and foreboding mansion in the middle of nowhere. Upon entering the estate, Zeke finds himself at the mercy of haunts -- a group of ghosts led by Madam Leota, a fortune teller face trapped inside a crystal ball; incidentally the same recognizable character from the Disney ride. Leota explains that Zeke will remain trapped inside the mansion until he captures all of the evil spirits that slink around it and until he returns light to the many darkened rooms of the location. You'll learn all of this through some well-conceived cut-sequences, but much of the storyline is delivered through static text, which is disappointing considering that one of this game's biggest appeals is its colorful theme.  That noted, developer High Voltage has done a fine job of creating a scary, but still altogether Disney-like universe. Though you'll explore dark hallways and occasionally encounter eerie ghosts, you'll also meet friendly ghosts that seem to have come direct from the ride itself, and many of the rooms appear similarly recognizable. This is sure to please anybody who has enjoyed the ride in the past. Further, parents can rest easy in the knowledge that this is not Resident Evil. It can be played and enjoyed by the entire family as most of the scares are light-hearted and there's very little in the way of violence to worry about.  The game itself is basic and seems to follow a standardized action-adventure formula. Zeke, armed with a magical lantern called the Beacon of Souls, moves about the mansion environment, captures ghosts, solves puzzles and restores light to rooms. Control is accessible -- the character can easily be made to walk, run, jump, shoot, look around, or execute various actions like flipping switches or opening doors. A lock-on system allows you to target ghosts and zap them with Zeke's lantern. For the most part this system works without fail, but there are some exceptions when multiple ghosts are involved. Though the control mechanics seem to get the job done, they are not what we would describe as overly precise. As a result, making tight jumps across platforms can be tricky, especially for the younger audience that this game best caters to.  Some of the puzzles are intriguing and creative. For instance, in an early scenario, the hero must cause a series of haunted instruments to begin playing and manipulate an unpredictable set of hovering stair-steps to activate a light switch. In another, Zeke is shrunk to fit on a pool table and it looks downright surreal. These puzzle elements are entertaining. But on the opposite end, the game perpetually requires you to search out and capture ghosts -- 999 in all -- and this process can and does eventually grow tedious, a problem that will frustrate some gamers.    Graphics The Haunted Mansion doesn't overwhelm with detail or advanced graphic engine effects, but it's not ugly either. The title features adequate character models, varied and with stylized designs very reminiscent of the exaggerated ghouls in the Disney ride. Zeke lacks the fluid movement of some motion-captured heroes, and yet he does run about the environments realistically. Some of the spirits are made all the more spooky thanks to similarly well-implemented animation sequences.  The locales themselves are dark, eerie and made all the more believable with background lighting effects like flashes of lightning and foreground niceties like illuminated ghosts. The texture work in the game gets the job done. However, because textures don't appear overly crisp, many of the rooms Zeke visits have a decidedly blurrier look about them, especially when the lights are turned on. Meanwhile, the lighting is overall impressive. The Beacon of Souls illuminates Zeke's face and the immediate area and his blasts temporarily light up environments. Particle effects are fairly standard.  The camera is usually tame, but can get in the way in tight areas. Thankfully the game generally runs at 60 frames per second with very little slowdown.  Sound Haunted Mansion features a fitting selection of soft, chilling music and eerie sound effects. You'll hear background whispers and thunder as you walk through the dark and mysterious location. The voice work is very limited, but occasionally ghosts will call Zeke by name. There are screams, gasps, howls and growls, and they mix well with the subdued, but ambient tracks. The only problem is that much of the sound effects are overused throughout the game.The Haunted Mansion is a surprisingly well-made adventure game set to the backdrop of Disney's spooky thrill ride -- and thankfully not the Eddie Murphy movie version. The game does a pretty decent job of retaining the style and spirit of the license without sacrificing on control mechanics or puzzle cleverness. For these reasons, parents looking for a safe, enjoyable title to play with their kids may find TDK's game a worthy selection.But on the other hand die-hard gamers will likely take issue with the formulaic item collection elements and under-developed control mechanics that the game has to offer. Plus, it's not exactly the prettiest game on the market (though it's by no means ugly.)Good, but not great.", "date": "Dec 17, 2003"}
