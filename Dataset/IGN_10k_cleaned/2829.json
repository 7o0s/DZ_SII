Here's a game that poses an age old question: What if a bunch of Italians made an anime game where futuristic shogun battle each other in giant robots? And the answer, in this case at least, is that you'd wind up with a game that's only slightly more enjoyable than walking around with a bucket of paint hanging from your testicles. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's still a game that you should smack out of people's hands if you ever see them contemplating its purchase.   The story itself isn't the big problem. In fact, bad though it is, it's the most interesting part of the game. Without going in to too much detail, let's just say that a giant wave has crushed Japan. The society of this futuristic wonderland that rises from this disaster lives by the code of the samurai. It's just that instead of swords, they do most of their fighting with giant robots.   You'll alternate between two characters, one a samurai, the other a masterless ronin, in a story filled -- well, sprinkled at least -- with giant robot pathos and a few key passages from The Book of Five Rings. It's a nice juxtaposition but I still don't buy it. The game offers two modes of play, both equally tedious and unpleasant. In one, you'll pilot your giant mech through a series of action-oriented levels; in the other, you'll exit your mech to go on a massive key hunt. It's far from the ~wave of adrenalin~ as advertised.    The giant robot portions have you piloting one of a few nearly identical mechs through a series of incredibly narrow environments. In terms of concept, it's a bit like Slave Zero. The levels are merely long hallways (albeit with a few twists and turns here and there) and there's no chance to really maneuver around your enemies. But what they do have is lots of pointless running. This is especially frustrating as the opening credits feature lots of flying robots that I can only assume are from some other, more enjoyable game.   The generic enemies also offer little challenge. With little room to move around and no cover whatsoever, they make easy targets. Whether running right at you or staring blindly at you from the other side of a glass door, they don't really provide enough of a challenge. If you do get killed, you'll have four chances to restart the level from whatever (non-apparent) checkpoint you've passed. Since there's no save feature, if you end a level before finishing it, you'll have to start over the next time you play.   You'll have two main weapons, a laser rifle and a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher, both of which you'll be firing pretty much non-stop in battle. The infinite ammunition and twitchy targeting remove any tension or tactical thinking from your mind. The rockets home in on some enemies (although most who want to dodge them can). Since the rockets travel so much slower than the laser and since both share the same reticle, you can all too often wind up missing with one or the other.   The few adventure-oriented levels have you exiting your mech and hoofing it on foot through an equally pointless series of key searches. Alternating between the twin enemies of locked doors and incompetent guards, the challenge is one of patience rather than skill. Though overly long, these sequences are mercifully few.   The engine is flat -out terrible. There's no sense of weight to the mechs, which is especially odd as you can completely kill yourself by falling from ~too great~ a height. The threshold for this is annoyingly ambiguous; I've often died from simply jumping a few feet in the air while occasionally I can fall off a cliff with nary a scratch. Characters also tend to get stuck against small obstructions or corners. This can be a big pain for the mechs because colliding with an object invariably makes you start jumping (which might kill you if you're not careful).   Graphically, it's not much better. Personally I think cel-shading, as a technique, is a bit overdone this year, but the design of the environmental textures and the black outlines around the models here are at least consistent with that look if not entirely convincing. Again, I don't object to the cartoon-like look of the game, but the effects, models and overall design of the game are somewhat amateurish.   The scripting could use a bit of work too. Let's just take one example. Early on you need to switch on a water valve to put out a fire. I switched it on, put out the fire and then, thoughtful environmentalist that I am, shut off the water again before proceeding. Minutes later a door further down the hall failed to open simply because the water was shut off. And once you open a locked door with a key or a card, the game reverts back to a locked script so that when you approach the door again, you're told you need a key despite the fact that you can walk right through it.    What did you think of Tsunami 2265? It wouldn't be a good Japanese-themed game (or Italian-designed as well) if it didn't have an awesome, yet completely incomprehensible acronym. And luckily Tsunami has one. The motive behind this giant robot fighting mayhem is the mysterious ELENA, or Earth Light Energy Alpha. Whoever came up with this name is never made clear, but everyone in the game seems to think it's important enough to plow through 13 levels.   As a minor aside, and I know Ivan's going to kick my ass when he hears this, giant robots are starting to get a little stale. Would anyone ever think a giant walking robot could be a practical, reliable, effective or efficient weapon of war? I can get into the romanticism of it, sure, but too many games just use giant robots as a setting because they don't seem to be able to think of anything as interesting. Still, I suppose that's like disliking an RPG where you heal yourself by eating apples.  One of the advantages of the PC gaming market is that anyone can make a game. One of the tragedies is that these people did. In the end, Tsunami 2265 doesn't have anything redeeming enough about it to be appealing and isn't even kitschy enough to make it worth your while to play it for camp's sake.Simply put, Tsunami 2265 is terrible. Probably the only good thing to come out of the whole experience is the game's opening song. Just imagine a driving 80s, generic pop anthem with cheesy power chords and lyrics about how war is love and love is war. In the end, that's only two minutes of fun followed by ten hours of tortuous game play.", "date": "Aug 5, 2002"}
