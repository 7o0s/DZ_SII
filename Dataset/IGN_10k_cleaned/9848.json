It's not even the first. That dubious honor goes to Black Belt, one of the Sega Master System's earliest fighting games. The game itself isn't a total horror show -- there is a little fun to be had in dusting this one off. Provided you can get past the game's atrocious box art. If there is such a thing as video game birth control, Sega's Master System box designs are them. They seemed designed to keep gamers' money in their wallets.   Black Belt replaces Fist of the North Star's Kenshiro with Riki, a karate master decked in a white gi. Riki must press through six repetitive stages of combat, kicking and punching away endless waves of incoming bad guys. Riki apparently has a strong kick, because five toes to the chops makes each enemy explode into four bloodless pieces. (Basically, the sprite just splits into quadrants and fall off-screen -- but at the time, that was kinda cool.) The sprites changed with each stage and occasionally birds entered into the mix, as well as a handful of mid-stage bosses that required a little pattern memorization to defeat.      Between each stage, Riki goes into a full-screen boss battle, which actually seems like the precursor for later fighting games, such as Street Fighter. Riki stands a few inches tall and dukes it out with a boss of equal size, each with a different fighting style. Unfortunately, Riki rarely learns any new tricks. You just had to get tot he boss stage and hope you survived long enough to get the patterns down before dying and having to start the whole game over. (This was especially frustrating when you fight all the way up to the last two bosses, Rita and Wang.)   The stage bosses were indeed the highlight of the game, and even though they have been diminished by time, they remain so. I remember thinking Oni and his exploding mask were so cool back in 1986. But then again, it's all about expectations folks, and I was coming off of the Atari 5200 at the time...  Black Belt is not one of the Master System's top tier games -- not by a long shot. But it still has a little charm left in it. If you want to build up a SMS library, you need to hunt this one down. It's worth a few bucks, and besides... don't you want the physical evidence to show your friends just how repellent box art used to be?", "date": "Jan 11, 2008"}
