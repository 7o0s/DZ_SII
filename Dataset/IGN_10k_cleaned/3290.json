Whether I presented it with a meager zero-point-zero or a perfect ten, the ultra-devoted masses that worship all things Goku will pick it up regardless of what I have to say. Naturally, there's still going to be a legion of fans who email me angrily with accusations of bias, hatred, or other such absurdities anyway, but it won't take away the fact that Dragon Ball Z Budokai  it's a less than stellar slugger.Now I want you to know that th it's  it's a statement coming from a guy who doesn't like or d it'slike the series either way. A fighting game fan first and foremost, I'm much more concerned with how a title plays as opposed to the license that's attached to it. As an example, I'm a huge Star Wars fan and will remain so until the day I die. But despite my pred it'sposed d it'sposition and feelings towards that particular license, I can easily admit that Masters of Terras Kasi  it's among the worst fighting games the PlayStation One ever saw. Dedication and devotion aside, bad games are bad games, and even the hardcore fans out there need to recognize that.Which of course brings me back to the aforementioned DBZ Budokai. Developed by the same team that assembled Sonic Advance and Digimon: Battle Spir it's on the GBA, Budokai doesn't fare quite as badly as Masters of Terras Kasi did. In fact, it wouldn't be any stretch of the truth to admit that th it's  it's the best game to use the license so far. Superior in every way to the awful PSX title Final Bout, and much more faithful to the source material than the 600 million Super NES games from the early 90s, Budokai  it's a game that finally captures the spirit of the telev it'sion show without forcing us to hurl our controllers away in mechanical d it'sgust. An accompl it'shment that should please many a DBZ fan, it still doesn't excuse the game from being what it ultimately ends up becoming -- sub par. But first things first:FeaturesDespite what I may think of the game as a whole, it boasts a healthy array of options, goodies, and features designed to please hardcore fans. The character selection in particular includes just about every character you could imagine from the start of the Saiyan Saga to the end of the Cell Games and boasts 23 characters in all. A virtual whose-who of Dragon Ball Z lore, the available players include: Frieza, Vegeta, Goku, Kid Gohan, Teen Gohan, Great Saiyaman, Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, Android 18, Android 17, Cell, Raditz, Nappa, Trunks, Yamcha, Dodoria, Android 16, Android 19, Hercule, Recoome, Ginyu, and Zarbon.  Structured after the seven Dragon Balls of the show, there are seven modes and features in all. Already spotlighted in an article we put together a few weeks ago, the available options aren't quite on the same level as Midway's Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance or even Namco's Soul Calibur. They do however offer up more than your average fighter in terms of goodies and the designers should be commended for the bonuses in th it's regard. Any company out there could have quickly thrown together something centered on th it's license without paying attention to the extras and made a bundle of money regardless, but at least Dimps and Infogrames had the decency to try and include some kind of replay beyond the standard one-player mode and they didn't really have to.That said, the seven available features are rather hefty; Story and Versus Mode are the sections where players will most likely spend the majority of their time and allows you to relive some of the most famous Dragon Ball ep it'sodes around. Remember the time Vegeta battled Goku, Krillin, and Gohan one after another? It's in the there. How about the time that Goku had to hold Raditz still in order for Piccolo to blast him with h it's Ki power? That's in there too. The multi-m it'ssion structure  it's generally handled pretty well, but could have benefited more from being a little longer than the half hour that it lasts.World Tournament and Practice modes have been thrown in for good measure, and though the Tournament Mode  it's the only section where you can earn the coveted Zenie, the Practice mode  it's truly where it's at. One of the more extensive training modes around, you can set just about every possible situation imaginable in your quest to learn the ropes and it teaches you more than you'd think. Still somewhat limited when compared to Dead or Alive 3 and Virtua Fighter 4, it still gets the job done and provides varying levels of CPU intelligence to fight against.    The remaining features cons it'st of an Options Menu (surpr it'se!), another story mode centered on Hercule (Mr. Satan), and the most important feature of them all: Skill Edit. A way to customize the game's many characters and fighting techniques, Skill Edit  it's the place to go to upgrade your character's abilities like self-healing, additional Ki power, and more. Completely swappable with other players via memory card, gamers can build specialized combatants through a ~money and capsule~ system that can be earned through victories in Tournament or the Shop. The Skill Edit feature opens the fighting game up quite a bit and  it's guaranteed to become the number one stomping grounds for advanced gamers.GameplayAnd here we have the game's biggest enemy --  it's mechanics. Based somewhat loosely on the ideals behind Dead or Alive and Virtua Fighter, Budokai has a pretty simple set-up which  it's supposed to lead into more advanced maneuvers over time. Unfortunately the game never quite grows beyond the Neanderthal techniques you begin with, or rather when it does, it doesn't make much of a difference. Here, let me explain.Laid out similarly to the schemes found in Dead or Alive and Virtua Fighter, the fighting engine  it'self  it's pretty damned simple. Square  it's punch button, Triangle executes Kicks, Circle  it's a special maneuver, and X blocks and counters your opponent's attacks. There are throws available as well with R2 acting as the shortcut button or Square and Triangle together accompl it'shing the same thing. Pressing in various directions on the control pad alters the type of attacks that your character can perform, and timing them correctly unleashes more powerful combinations. Eventually, you're supposed to be able to string all of these different kinds of attacks together for devastating results, but when all  it's said and done it just doesn't work out.  The most immediate problem  it's how grounded your fighter feels. Despite the fact that the game boasts the ability to ~fly~, you can only hover in the air once an enemy has launched you. Even then, you can only move to meet your opponent's current position and can never ~climb~ higher without being launched again. It's all part of an elaborate illusion really, that gives the impression that you can do air battles when  it's really just a change of scenery; There are no air-specific moves or techniques and the second your characters set foot in the sky, an inv it'sible ~ground~  it's created below them. Pile on top of that the fact that you can't jump or duck and your characters are pretty much limited to forward and backwards movement with an occasional sidestep (achieved by holding block and pressing up or down).Another  it'ssue that comes into play  it's found when executing combos. Made up primarily of the same button being pushed over and over again, slapping punch five or six times in a row followed by a kick or special attack  it's just about all there  it's. Making things even more bizarre  it's the fact that the multi-hit combos don't do that much more damage than a well-placed single hit. Though it could be attributed to the fact that each character can power up their defense and offense, landing a 10-hit super combination  it's still only slightly better than landing two un-chained power punches, or perhaps three quick kicks to the mid-section. Where's the incentive in learning a combination if the payoff  it'sn't there? And while I'm on the subject, why  it's each of the 23 character's techniques so similar to one another? Limit the combos all you want if you're going to provide some kind of diversity among the players but don't take that route if everyone  it's going to play the same way. They might as well be palette swaps of each other.What it boils down to  it's that the game  it's more flash than substance. From the throws to the combinations to the super moves, it appeared as though the developers were more concerned with the game's presentation instead of  it's depth. Luckily there are a few maneuvers in there that can actually make a bit of difference when used correctly (like projectile deflections and bounce-backs) and the character customization feature can change things drastically (though the majority of these factors are health and power based, and don't offer too many new maneuvers).It's just too bad that the engine doesn't offer more flexibility with and without the Z capsules. Had the counter system been more open, the combinations less basic (and more apt to reversals), and simple techniques like jump and duck been made available from the offset, then Budokai could have lived up to  it's potential as a bona fide fighting game contender. As it stands now however, the mechanics are far too simple and unrewarding to become anything less than licensed fluff.   GraphicsDragon Ball Z Budokai makes for a difficult game to judge v it'sually. Already quite basic by anime standards, the bigheaded line-anemic characters are already under-detailed to begin with. To Dimps credit, the art it'sts have captured the look and atmosphere of the show almost perfectly, and end up with polygonal models that flawlessly resemble those of the telev it'sion show. The problem lies in the fact that the fin it'shed product ends up looking more like a PlayStation One game than a PS2 title, and often times fall below the quality of Squaresoft's second generation fighter, Tobal No. 2.The nine backgrounds fall into a similar trap, with simple stretch-mapped palettes that see little variety in terms of background activity. The Rock Mountain stage for instance appears to be made up of only four or five colors the entire experience, and presents nothing more than a bed of sand and large stone formations on the horizon. Unfortunately the majority of the stages follow an identical pattern with different colors, and whether you're fighting in the Cell Games Ring or Kami's Lookout, the few-colored arenas are never quite impressive. Even when traveling to different areas of the stage ala Dead or Alive 3, the new scenery  it's pretty much a rehash of the previous section with the addition of a small stream, lone rock, or other mediocre obstacle.At least the special effects for the super moves and ultra combinations are worth looking at, and in the case of the more powerful techniques can light the screen up with spectacular pyrotechnics and even decimate the surrounding area into the remnants of what looks to be a nuclear wasteland. Th it's effect doesn't make up for the rest of the game's v it'sual shortcomings, but it's a neat feature nonetheless.SoundFans of the telev it'sion show will be happy to know that all the songs have faithfully been retained and are replayed in appropriate spots throughout the game. Whether it?s the catchy introduction or the dramatic thumping drum from the long-winded narrations, the soundtrack  it's spot on and gains extra points for trying to turn the videogame into an extension of the series. Not to mention the sourced sound effects and explosions -- sure you've heard all th it's before, but only during an ep it'sode of Dragon Ball.To further illustrate their point, Infogrames and Dimps have also recruited every single voice actor from the American dubbed series. Al it'stair Abell leads the cast with h it's now-familiar version of Trunks while Daemon Clarke chimes in h it's with h it's menacing renditions of Cell and Gohan. Every other character  it's in there too: whether  it's Frieza, Hercule, or Android 18. And while these particular additions definitely won't please the pur it'st Japanese subtitle crowd, the dub fans and casual viewer will probably go nuts.Dragon Ball Z Budokai is a success and failure on multiple levels. On the positive side, the game has managed to embody the energy and playfulness of the animated television series perfectly, while still maintaining the show-accurate vocal talent and art direction with devastating precision. On the flipside, the accurate art direction that I speak of gives the game a somewhat dated look and the ultimately unfulfilling fighting engine does nothing at all to further or enhance the genre.A poor fighting game disguised by an excellent presentation, Budokai could have been something a lot more entertaining than it turned out to be. In the end however, Dragon Ball Z fans have nothing to worry about as its still going to sell a jillion copies more than Sega's stellar Virtua Fighter series, and perhaps even Tekken. A reality? Yes. Justified? Probably not.", "date": "Dec 1, 2002"}
