Even with its late arrival, it captured the fancy of baseball fans and trashtalkers the world over, finishing as the number one selling baseball game of last year (although there are those who refute this claim). Fast forward nine months, and Midway is up to bat again, with this year's addition, MLB Slugfest 20-04.   There's been plenty of discussion about whether action sports titles like Blitz, Hitz and now Slugfest, can maintain momentum in a marketplace dominated by sim-style offerings. Since action sports titles often do not deliver the realism and depth of their less-arcadey counterparts on the market,  the yearly issue is ~why should I buy this game again?~ Updated rosters and slightly enhanced graphics are not enough to make a buyer shell out fifty more bills.   Luckily, this year's iteration of Slugfest irons out some of the issues of its predecessor, and adds a little more functionality and some control depth. Even though this will always be primarily a multiplayer game, Midway has tried to add elements that might appeal to someone who wants to play through a season, like realistic stats, more players per team, more pitches and better AI. Bottom line, Slugfest is worth a look this year, especially if you contemplated checking it out last year. You may not commit to purchasing the game again if you already own it, but first-time buyers will get a lot more bang for their buck this time around. Here's what's been added to the game this year, for quick reference:  Create-A-Team functionality Customizable instant replay Home Run Derby New batting stances and pitching motions More fantasy stadiums and characters (plus new codes) Expanded rosters (20 players in all, with six pitchers) New commentary   Gameplay The basic gameplay of Slugfest has remained intact. This is still adrenaline baseball, it's still easy to pick up, and it's tough to put down... especially as a two player experience. The idea falls in line with games like Blitz. This is baseball, but baseball with an attitude. Players look like roid monkeys (no, wait... that's the real game), pitches reach speeds of over 120 mph, fielders can vertical leap twenty feet into the air, and a ball hit to the wall can still result in a put-out at first base, if one throws it with enough juice.  Turbo is a large factor in the game, and is handled well throughout. You can pretty much use it in any situation: batting, fielding, running, pitching. It makes you throw harder, jump higher, swing with more power and run with more speed. You only have a limited amount, and you must pull off spectacular plays in order to refill the meter, or you'll go dry and be left with wimpier swings, leaden feet and no ups. Of course, the flip side of the coin is ~on fire.~ As you rack up more and more spectacular plays, your player will begin to smoke, then catch fire. On fire means the same thing it did back in the Jam days--your player temporarily turns into a bad-ass, and gets a ratings boost until he loses the fire. The turbo system is one of the things that sets the game apart from standard sports fare, and adds a lot to the two-player game especially. Remember how cool getting a Gamebreaker in NBA Street is? Same concept, same elation.    As with all of their sports franchises, Midway relies on this kind of action and fun to fuel its game, not deep, realistic sport mechanics. That calls for a lot of crazy acrobatics, a lot of power, and quite a bit of extracurricular play. It also calls for immediate pick-up-and-playability. The controls are easy to learn. In fact, any control you need to know at any given time is displayed right on the screen. Firmly rooted in the arcade, Midway has an expert handle on making a game easy to get into. Within seconds of grabbing the controller, you'll be focused on what's important--and that's having a good time, making sick plays, and trying to one-up whoever you're playing against.  The goal of Slugfest is not only to beat your opponent, but to beat your opponent to a bloody pulp as well. Beaning batters and clocking fielders is an integral part of the game. By doing this, you can drop a player's stats and rattle him at the next at-bat. Or, if he charges the mound after getting hit, he may gain a ratings boost and punish you . Also, while running the bases, you can choose to beat on the fielders (provided they didn't tag you out). If you hit hard enough, you could jar the ball loose and create enough space to advance a base. This game-within-the-game gamble is part of what makes the multiplayer so fun.      The game flows well, and feels a slightly better than last year's version, thanks to some of the additions. 20-04 adds an extra page of pitches, which allows for more strategy and deception. Also added is the Special Pitch. Activated once your pitcher has strung together a series of great throws, this feature serves up one crazy pitch that is uber-hard to hit. The Special Pitches vary from wildly zig-zagging fastballs to high, arching softball style changeups that require waaaaay too much patience.   Another crucial addition to the game, although it might not originally seem so, is the expanded roster. This is not as important for fielders, but a selection of pitchers is nice to have, especially if you want to keep your opponent guessing. This change does a lot to bolster the single player game as well as the multiplayer experience.  Speaking of that, Slugfest is definitely best as a two-player game. Head-to-head competition was really the only way to get longevity out of last year's version. In single player, the game's AI was too easy to pick apart early on. This was mainly due to the fact that the players were not all that differentiated. If you were skilled at hitting, no matter how bad the batter at the plate was, you could eke out a hit.   This has been addressed somewhat with more accurately represented player stats in 20-04, but the single player game still gets old after awhile. Expanded rosters, expanded pitching options and special pitches will help the game stay fresher longer, but it's unlikely you'll last a whole season. A much more enticing goal is to finish the Challenge Mode, which hearkens back to the arcade experience, where you have to beat teams one-by-one to advance, working from weakest to strongest.   The Midway Sports team has tried to add a few bells and whistles (in addition to the things listed above) to improve the single player experience this time around, but for the most part, they failed in their mission. The most prominent of the changes is the ability to Create-a-Team. NHL Hitz 20-03 did a great job with this, and I was expecting more of the same from this game. Hitz let you customize all of the players and gear, and the ability to create a player was integral in making the best squad. Here, the Create-a-Team function is limited to trading players and putting together the ultimate roster. While this sounds fun on the surface, it is too easy to compile an all-hero roster and make the game severely easy. What's to stop you? The lack of any real customization and creativity really hurts the Create-a-Team, and by extension, any game mode that utilizes the created teams.  The Home Run Derby is another new addition, and it's a lot of fun. As a single player experience, it's even a lot of fun, but the thrill doesn't last. After you win a couple of derbies, you'll be looking around for someone meatier to face.    Graphics Last year we stated this was one of the best looking baseball games on the market. While it still looks great, not much has been added graphically that has made us stand up and take note. That's not a bad thing necessarily, because Slugfest looked pretty darn good last go-around.   The character models look about the same, meaning they look good. Midway has taken a little artistic license and given the Lou Ferrigno treatment to nearly everyone on the roster. That's okay. Even though the players look bulky, they're well-rendered and the faces, for the most part, are accurate.   To enhance the realism, Midway has added specific players' signature stances and pitching motions, which does a lot to differentiate between players. One of the knocks on last year's game was stale animations. This iteration delivers diverse and recognizable motions that will please baseball fans.  For those who pick up the game for its action elements, there are a lot of animations thrown in merely to make you laugh. The pre-batting ritual animations are good examples of this. Players jam their bats into the earth, swat at flies, or dramatically psyche themselves up at the plate. Bean-ball and strikeout animations are often quite funny as well, if a bit repetitive. One strikeout animation has the batter crawl back to the dugout on all fours. It can be annoying if you're the one who struck out, but it's sweet to see if you're the one pitching.      For frame rate-watchers out there, the game runs pretty smooth. If you're a total graphics snob, you'll notice that there is clipping between players quite frequently, but most of that occurs when a player comes into contact with another player after the ball is dead.  Customizable replays have been added to this version of Slugfest as well. If you're a sports gamer, the replay system will strike you as standard to simplistic, although it does give you an opportunity to check out the player models and excellent field textures in closer detail.   That's something you might want to do. The stadia are quite well done in this game, and the grass (especially in the infield), looks really nice. This game captures the smear of sand into grass possibly better than any other on the market. The crowds are 3D this time around as well, and look pretty darn good.  One last thing that should be noted about the graphics--the effects are quite nice once again. The little things--players engulfed in flames, the trailing streak of the ball, and the fireworks that go off when you crack a homer--are done well throughout, adding an extra bit of flair and detail, like icing on the cake.  Sound One standout element of last year's offering was its announcers, which along with NHL 2002 and Blast Lacrosse deserve props as some of the funniest around. The duo from last year return with a one-two punch of straight man Tim Kitzrow and the befuddled, befuddling color man ~Jimmy Shorts.~ The banter and play between the announcers is great, and there are enough phrases to keep the game fresh for awhile. If you decide to play an entire franchise, the commentary can get tiresome, but there is an option to turn off Jimmy's random comments, so once you've laughed at all of them twenty times, you can end the repetition.  Sound effects in the game are decent, but nothing extremely special. The sounds are adequate and not at all intrusive, which is good. For as dynamic as this game is, you'd expect the crowd noises to be a bit more frenzied as well. There are some cool touches, though. For instance, when you enter the code for the Bone Bat, the bat makes a hollow noise when you hit the ball. These details are nice, but the commentary is still the best thing about the audio area of the game.    I should also mention that Hoobastank recorded the title cut for the game. It's called ~Crawling in the Dark,~ and somehow it relates to baseball. You see, it's all that crawling in the dark that ballplayers do.    As stated earlier, Slugfest will always be a better two-player experience. The single player still does not have the depth of AI to contend with some of the more sim-style titles on the market. The addition of Create-a-Team is a noble idea, but it would have needed better implementation to be a real draw. That's not to say there isn't a place for this game in your library. It's hollerin' fun if you have a group of people gathered, and can be cool solo if you stick to theChallenge Mode.If you thought about buying last year's version and held off, this one offers a lot more in terms of gameplay features. The addition of Special Pitches is especially nice, and will definitely elicit a ~Damn!~ the first time you see one whiz past. The Home Run Derby is also a good addition, as it extends playability and lends added challenge to the overall experience. If you already own Slugfest 20-03, rent 20-04 and see if the changes warrant a new purchase.", "date": "Mar 12, 2003"}
