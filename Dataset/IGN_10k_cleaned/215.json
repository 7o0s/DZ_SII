Console players have always had to endure some ~cutting of corners~ so to speak; either in frame rate, graphical presentation or, in most instances both.  With the advent of Sega's Flag-To-Flag (formerly known as CART Racing, and Super Speed Racing) the wait is truly over.  Coming across the finish line with a super-solid frame-rate and graphics to simply die for, Flag-To-Flag marks the beginning of the end for sub-par motor-sports offerings in the console arena.  I want to jump right in and say that this is the very first time, on a console, that I have played an F1 or CART (Championship Auto Racing Team) game in which I can actually play from the best vantage point there is-the driver's seat! Yes folks, the crew over at Sega has managed to get the one consistently niggling aspect, which derails the praise levied on racing games, right this time.  You can play from behind the steering wheel, with a great level of confidence and assurance.  That, in and of itself, is a feat that Sega should be proud of.  I may be going in a pseudo-reverse order here, but this is of paramount importance to speed-demons and racing fans.  Nothing can aggravate someone more than having to view the track in third person, like a friggin' spectator at a racing event.  You generally don't get nearly the same sense of speed, and the game becomes less immersive, as you don't feel more like a far off operator of the car, rather than the actual driver.  Seated in the car, the player will observe their virtual likeness working the steering wheel, shifting gears and even cleaning away the debris from his soiled visor as rubber and dirt accumulate.  Laid out all around the perimeter of the screen you will see, in additon to an overhead grid, information on speed, lap, position, best lap times, record lap times, etc..  The actual trackside view is just as good as the cockpit view, particularly since the view distance is superb.  Moreover, while there is some detectable draw-in of distant objects, it truly in no way affects the gameplay or enjoyment of the experience at all.  The game is laced with a plethora of sponsors such as; FedEx , Snap-On, Coca~Cola Castrol, Fuji Film, Bosch, Toyota,  and Firestone to name a few.  The game is also licensed by the FIA and therefore has real drivers and real teams.  You've got the Fittapaldi team, the Hass (Andretti) team, Vasser, Tracy, Rahal and the rest.  The cars are modeled to look like the real things - and boy (girl) do they!  Everything is faithfully represented right down to the sponsor decals and paint jobs.  Which brings me to another area of the game that deserves praise.  The environmental mapping used in this game is terrific to view, particularly in Replay Mode.  These cars glisten with fine paint, and terrific reflections of the surrounding terrain.  The result is that the replays look incredibly vivid and realistic.  This is not even a ~squint and it looks like...~ deal here.  This $#!+ looks so damn real it's crazy.  Thankfully, you can save and watch your greatest moments whenever you like.  And I'll say that watching these cars careen around the raceways at speeds in excess of 220 mph is a site to behold.  The relative speed is scaled just perfectly and the recorded and attainable times are factored in just right.  You will not find unrealistic lap times melded with a feeling of speed that just won't jive for ya'.  This game comes off quite finely tuned and everything is relatively accurate.  As mentioned in the preview of this title, there were previously some rather unforgivable, documented AI anomalies in the earlier Japanese incarnation.  I'm referring specifically to cars that slowed to a halt allowing the player a chance to pass.  I don't know what ~gave~ with that major flaw, but I have not seen any of it in this version.  In fact, the CPU vehicles do a fair job of being very skittish about letting someone pass, although you can go inside rather easily with some of the lagging cars.  But I have a theory on why this is so; which relates to one of the games shortcomings.  Anytime that the grass (shoulder) on the inside is rolled upon, your car will instantly slow from a brisk 100+ or 200+ mph to around 40 mph.  At those speeds, that is the equivalent of a dead stop.  It's odd, it's weird and it's (most importantly) not very true to life.  So if this is the result when you get too close to the grass and kiss it, no wonder the AI cars leave plenty of room down-under for those daring enough to take the risk.  Another minor complaint is that when contact is made with other cars, often times the sound of screeching tires will not dissipate until the brake is blipped again.  Doing so though, will have a negative affect on the speed of the car, so it is recommended that you endure this faux pas until the next turn sequence, at which time it should correct itself.  On the subject of speed, did I mention that this game is fast?  Well, it is fast!  You will really enjoy the sense of speed, because it never lets up. Cars just blur past, taking up the best possible position, accelerating and decelerating with the finesse of true CART drivers.  The frame rate remains constant, seemingly at all times, and there is no loss in speed, even when a majority of the CPU vehicles have crowded your screen.  What's more is that even in spilt-screen versus mode, you have five playable camera angles from nose-cam to 3/4 overhead chase-cam, and the frame rate remains in tact. While you do loose the rearview mirrors, in split-screen, the rest of the graphical presentation remains quite faithful.  One thing of note: There are no bona fide collisions in this game, so that sense of realism is not a factor.  However, in Simulation Mode, there is a noticeable degradation of performance with too frequent contact with other cars and or the walls, so pitting is important and an absolute must when tire wear and/or damage become a factor.  You can certainly tell when you are tearing up those tires too, because you will see lots of your expensive rubber left on the tarmac as a reminder.  All of this racing glory plays out in an environment that is colorful, vibrant and bright.  Monaco Grand Prix may be more aesthetically pleasing to some, but I'll take the vivid color palette, playable camera views and increased sense of sheer speed that Flag-To-Flag offers any day.  The tracks are well proportioned, and while I am not one who would know exactly what Long Beach or Nazareth would or should look like, I did some research online and found that they have been well represented in the game, both geometrically and scale-wise.  This is another nice attribute, especially since the tracks play just as an important role in the game as do the cars and their drivers.  In my preview I talked of this game being well balanced.  In doing so I stressed that the Arcade Mode is very ~arcade~ in nature.  You have an easy learning curve, tons of speed, and relatively simple controls to deal with.  There is no damage in Arcade Mode and no tire wear issues, so pitting is not a component of smart play.  Just rev it up and go full-tilt-boogey!  There are two ways, once up to speed, that the player can choose to navigate these high-speed courses.  You can power brake, that is applying the brakes while not releasing the throttle, or you can use a combination of deceleration and braking.  Either method seems to work in both Arcade and Simulation, so you can pretty-much take your pick.  Just be certain to maintain the best line, and maximum acceleration into straight-aways.  This will assure that you stay in the forward-most part of the pack.  When playing the game in the Simulation Mode, you will have the added task of qualifying for position in the grid, as well as managing things like damage, fuel management and the configuration of your car.  I have always felt that console simulations should gear themselves toward the masses.  Meaning that the control should take into consideration the fact that many people will not play a game with other than the controller that is packaged with the system.  Flag-To-Flag does this effectively by not taking the simulation aspect of the game too seriously.  In this game, Simulation Mode merely enhances the default gameplay by adding new management issues, lengthening the amount of time and the number of laps it takes to complete a race, and spiffing up the AI car's intelligence.  Aurally, this game is light-years ahead of Monaco GP.  The sound quality of effects is very good, and they have chosen to dump the now traditional Techno tunage for something a bit more...erm...Satriani-esque.  I, quite frankly, warmed up to the change in musical direction.  Then there is the, ~Gentleman...Start You Engines!~  This is great stuff.  You begin from rolling starts, so the engine sounds are already cranking at about 140 mph, the result being that you get a boost in car effects when the race begins.  All very nice touches and, again, the sound quality is very good.  This makes the game very playable from a longevity standpoint, because players won't soon tire of the car sounds and such.  With two solid racing experiences on the Sega Dreamcast for launch, fans of the genre have much to be excited about.  Both offerings have their respective strengths and weaknesses.  While the cars here may look the same, F1 is different than CART racing.  When one considers that two different development houses crafted these fine racers, it is interesting to note that, for all intents and purposes, they got the nuances of each right enough that you can tell the differences from one to another.  While Monaco GP offers more realism in the simulation side of things, it is decidedly less fun for the casual gamer.  Flag-To-Flag is geared with the casual gamer in mind, and will likely stand out as a prime choice early on in the Dreamcast's life.  -- Fabian Blache III, IGNDC", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
