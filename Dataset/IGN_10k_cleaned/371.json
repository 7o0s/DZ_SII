But just as the best ideas are initially rejected in every field, from science (Darwin's Theory of Evolution) to entertainment (wrestling as the number one TV show) to videogames (executives scoffed at Shigeru Miyamoto's first arcade game, Donkey Kong), snowboard games have led the game industry into extreme sports like none other.   While many companies have tried to make good snowboarding games, Capcom, which usually develops fantastic games, hasn't been as fortunate as others in this area. Yet when I first saw the opening level of Trick'n Snowboarder, my deep Chionophobia (fear of snow) imposed by dozens of poor snowboarding games melted. While the rest of the game chilled off as I got farther into it, a healthy dose of Capcom charm kept my blood warm and endeared me to enjoy it.  Gameplay Trick'n Snowboarder centers on four characters looking to make a name for themselves on the international snowboarding circuit. As part of team called Extreme Tour, you'll visit nine countries to compete on 11 different courses (including two half-pipes and four slalom runs). While the courses tend to narrow as you progress from one to the next, each run is diverse and offers lots of air. One run is a specially-designed snowboard park with unnatural objects designed specifically to challenge your dexterity; another ends with an unnatural cliff that would frighten paragliders, much less snowboarders.   What separates Trick'n from the posers is this Extreme Team scenario mode. It's a quest that ignores the medal system of typical racers by focusing on the trick system. As the key member of Extreme Team, you are the star of a video shoot hoping to capture the best of the sport. A helicopter camera crew follows your every move, and they often ask you to hang a specific trick off a given object. When you burst through a waterfall or launch off a snowed-in Japanese dojo, you'd better give them a slick grab-to-grab or a wicked spin, or you're cut from the team. Along the way, other racers will challenge you to a race or a trick competition, and while these challenges don't necessarily affect your progression in the game, your Grizzley Adams look-alike coach will look down on you if you lose. Of course, there are the other standard modes such as free run Time Trials and VS play for those who find the scenario mode too limiting on their freestyle.  Tricks in Trick'n Snowboarder aren't nearly as complicated as Tony Hawk or even Cool Boarders. Like Tony Hawk, you hold a button (flip, twist, or grab) and a direction to activate a specific maneuver, and the key is also to link several different airborne moves. However, the system is extremely simplified, and so the only way to really botch a trick is to land on your head.  In fact, the game is a step back for the snowboarding genre in general, as many of the options of other boarders just aren't here. However, that's not necessarily a negative. It's refreshing to just point your board downhill and go. Jumps are instantaneous, ignoring the prep time found in Cool Boarders, but the feel of the game fits a more direct input. This is a fast-paced racer, and so it concentrates on precision rather than complication. The only real concession to realism is that you have to watch your stance -- get into a fakie stance and you'll slow down. Graphics Capcom style is all over this one. Every character is a Street Fighter cousin in a parka. There are only four available at the opening of the game, but skilled players can unlock other freaks, like the pink kitten Ashley and the Dhalsim-baby Majagh. There are even some Raccoon City residents present, on vacation from their day job of zombie stomping. Everybody is drawn in anime style, and while these characters don't present themselves quite as well in-game, it's nice to be home in Capcom Land.   For the legions of Cool Boarders fans who love the colors gray and white, Trick'n leads them astray with a vibrant color palette covering all of the shades of the morning. Nintendo's 1080 did the same trick, but in Capcom Land it's all new and delicious again. Courses are nicely shaded on the backsides of the mountains, and the track side details, while often sprite-based, are nicely varied. Similar to Namco's coin-op Alpine Racer, Trick'n is filled with all kinds of distractions, like the hot air balloon coasting overhead and the dog that chases you when you jump over his house. There are even courses that start with a launch from a moving helicopter. Little details like this are abundant and keep the racing fresh.  The one thing that nearly cracks this boarder in half is that the complication of the courses weighs heavily on the engine, and sometimes the engine just doesn't hold up. Tracks are limited to two racers on the hill, and the whole shot is just not as enjoyable when you realize you're beating just one guy. The two-player mode slows down to a nearly unplayable level instead of removing some eye candy (however, there is a link cable option). And, worst of all, the scenario mode features the same slowdown due to the fact that the designers decided to feature a picture-in-picture at the key jump points. This leads to an infuriating experience, as the exact moments when you have psyched yourself up for a big trick are the moments when the game grinds to a crawl. You end up planning simpler tricks at these points just to get through them alive, which totally abominates the very heart of the game.   Sound What would a trip to Capcom Land be without energetic synth music? Trick'n delivers all of the energy and feel of snowboarding without all those high-price licensed American metal bands droning on and on. What's a step above is that the music fits the environment well. Mellow areas are denoted by low-key music. The music isn't quite flavored by the international locales of the games, but the focus here is on mood instead of accuracy. The overall soundtrack is just as complicated as the graphics, as there are plenty of touches (dog barking, church bells toning the hour) that color the experience. One area even omits the music to highlight its audio presentation -- the howl of the wind is the theme to the area. Added to this is the constant commentary from your crew, who aren't all that accurate in deciding what trick is slick and which crash is trash, but at least add to the sonic atmosphere.Bad snowboarders are a dime a dozen. Average snowboarders are a refreshing change of pace. This game isn't much more than an average snowboarder, but its scenario mode and anime characters add a lot. There's nothing revolutionary, but it is fun from the very first level, and that's important. Die-hard snowboarders can pass, but others who want to hit the powder and have fun should take a look at this one. However, faults in the scenario mode drag this one down, and the chunky 2-player mode fails to take up the slack.", "date": "Nov 4, 1999"}
