Combining over the top special effects, entertaining action sequences, and the star power of a M isn'ter Wesley Snipes, the movie lit up video chains and matinee houses like few comic flicks before it. Earlier this year, the sequel followed suit, offering more violence, better direction, and all around better motion picture.To celebrate the DVD release just days ago, Activision has brought its own brand of half-vampire justice to the videogame world with the like-titled Blade II. And while the game isn't the worst you'll ever play, it's certainly not one you'll want to run out and snatch before your neighbors do either. To be honest, there isn?t much to find beyond the horrendous controls and suspiciously bad gameplay. Of course we could stop there, but then our opinion would make for one terribly short review.StoryBorn the son of a woman bitten by a vampire, Blade is half-human/half-bloodsucker known to his kind as the ~Daywalker~.  Because of his cross-genetics his powers are uniquely his own, and allows him the dark gift of the pyre (such as super strength, heightened agility, and scornful attitude) and very few drawbacks (that's right, he can live in the sunlight without a problem). Unfortunately for Blade, he's not accepted by either human or vampire, relinquishing him to a life as an outsider, and one that has helped convince him that it's time to put an end to the scourge of his dark half.Taking place six months after the events of Blade II, the videogame has a rather simple premise -- bad guys want to do bad things and only Blade can stop them to save the world. With the help of his mentor Wh isn'tler, the vampire hunter must face off against the hordes of the undead while using a small variety of his abilities and artillery. To put it quite simply, he's fighting his way through ~generic action game #522~.FeaturesA straggler for attention at this year?s Electronic Entertainment Expo, and renowned underachiever, Blade II isn?t exactly the Fort Knox of videogame features. Though it does sport a fully functional 360-degree combat system and a host of powerful abilities (like the Katana and super-strength attribute), there isn?t much else to write home about. P isn'tols, Shotguns, and the decapitating glaive weapon make for a nice arsenal and the DVD extras that are available from the outset are a nice touch, but what it all boils down to is commercialism, and a lot of it.  Luckily, the quality of the full motion video and sound-alike voice acting are above the norm, and boost the presentation points a few notches beyond mediocrity. Of special note is the X-Men: Next Dimension trailer which appears as though it could be a much ore authentic (and fun) comic book joyride. Sadly, we're left with another month to go before we can find out.GameplayBlade II takes a valiant stab at innovation with a fighting system meant to represent the freedom of 360-degree versatility via the two thumb sticks. The right analog is used to pull off martial arts maneuvers while pressing the face button to perform your favorite hand-to-hand violence, while the left stick moves you wherever you want to go. With eight different directions, theory says that pushing in your desired location will result in any enemy (regardless of their position) getting knocked silly. Sadly, this is extremely difficult to get a hold of and will probably result in a mass exodus of gamers minutes after booting it up. Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack would have been a better way to go.For example: you can't choose to punch one fellow and then kick another in the heat of a battle. Instead, the direction of your attack determines what kind of fury will be unleashed from the leather. The general rule of thumb says that pushing forward always results in a punch, while a backwards push is the equivalent of the kick. It is possible to pull of different types of combos however, if you can pinpoint the necessary rhythmic motions needed to do so, but in the end it ends up becoming too frustrating for its own good.    The nature of the genre itself dictates the ability to pull off button and directional movements in a flurry as a requirement. But here, the combos (of which the variation is quite limited) bend you into biding your time and become the master of patience.  Pushing left, left, left quickly will only result in the same three movements and not a combination; Should you really want to pull that off, you're supposed to go left, (pause), left, (pause), and then left to be successful. It may sound easy (and it is in practice) but getting it to work while tromping through a game filled with enemies is a different beast entirely.Because you have to use the thumb stick (which represents the direction of an attack) combat turns out to be very stilted. The minute you begin fighting, your character stops progressing forward. It's almost as though the game expects promotes the repeated surrounding of the player as to hide the shortcomings of the engine. What's the point of having super speed and agility if you don't get to use it?  That's a question Blade may never answer as whenever he halts to beat someone up, you'll give about half a dozen other vamps the opportunity to come in and gang up on you. Ho hum.Another area of displeasure is Blade II's frustrating habit of on-again/off-again intelligence; it's almost bipolar.  Sometimes you can kill a few vamps and his surviving buddy runs away, while in other instances you'll waste six vampires in a crowd and the three blokes next to him stand still as if nothings happening. -- They don't run, they don't attack, they don't do anything!  Argh!Truth be told, the developers didn't go far enough.  If you are going to use the stick for attacks, then use it to its full capabilities (its potential is far more than ~up and down~ and ~side to side~). Why aren't there projectile attacks or a deeper variety of standard fighting maneuvers?  Innovation should be something that people chatter about excitedly, not curse at without refute.RageBeing half-vampire has its advantages. As Blade fights and pulls off his combos, he increases his rage meter, which satiates his bloodlust and making him more powerful. At first he gains the ability to use his sword. Then, as his rage increases, he gains a shield of invulnerability, and finally increased strength. The added power is great, as the punches and kicks will send your enemies flying.  It's almost too bad this wasn't the norm in the game, as things really start to kick when you go nuts and wield the sword, especially when you notice that enemy deaths are much more gruesome and the combat strangely more lucid. What doesn't make sense though, is why your rage needs to be increased to use a sword.  I mean -- it's a sword. It appears to be a very forced gameplay limitation.WeaponsBlade has a small assortment of artillery, which increases as the game progresses. Beginning with an automatic p isn'tol, you'll eventually unlock new weapons, such as a shotgun, a glaive (think Batarang), and spiky silver knuckles as your score increases. You'll only have a few weapon slots available for each mission however, so even if you have everything expect to wield only a handful of your goodies. On the flipside of the sword issue, this was a much more intelligent way of limiting the player and keeping anyone from becoming too powerful.The only nagging problem with regard to the weapons is the fact that you can still pull off martial arts attack with a gat in your hand. Yeah, you should be able to kick a guy behind you even if you are wielding a p isn'tol, but you shouldn't be punching him like some kind of freak as if nothing were in it.  It looks strange and feels cheap.   GraphicsBlade II isn't exactly a stellar example of how the PlayStation 2 at work. Character models are decent, but the animations are repetitive and there's not enough variety to keep the game visually stimulating. At least the environments fare better with boring parking garages, vampire Disco Tech's and underground sewers.The lighting leaves a lot to be desired, and was handled in a much better form with the Xbox version (although, from what we've seen it wasn't all that on that system either) and most of the models end up looking like flat sheets because of it. Not to mention the fact that the colors are boring and drab, the animations jittery, and jaggies in the least expected of areas.SoundBlade II's music is repetitive and seems derivative of your standard action titles while the sound effects leave a lot to be desired.  Weapon fire seems piddling and Blade himself manages just a rather small stock of quips to keep you entertained in the meantime.  At least the voice acting is cleverly done, with a Wesley Snipes sound alike and dialogue that doesn't sound too hokey. Normally an area that movie based games can be knocked on, the lack of actual vocal star power isn't that sorely missed.And let us just say, that even though the PlayStation 2 version doesn't support the same Dolby 4.0 setup that its Xbox cousin does, the stereophonic presentation does a commendable job of hammering home the audible points. What the disc lacks in technology, it's made up for in good old-fashioned loudness.  We hate to say it, but we saw this one coming from a mile away. Not up to par in any of the previous sessions we experienced leading up to its release, Blade II has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame.And while industry veterans and old-school players may joke that it's been that way since the Atari 2600 days, having a blockbuster tag attached to your title doesn't automatically give permission to create an inferior product that may or may not sell. Clunky, methodical, and definitely on the boring side, Mucky Foot's latest creation should have spent a little more time in the dark before coming into the sunlight.", "date": "Sep 4, 2002"}
