Nevertheless, we had high hopes for the game and even heard rumors over the summer from people suggesting that it was visually superior to EA Sports' title. However, the optimism was quickly squashed when we finally got the chance to check out the game in mid-October at a special press event for the game.   After about half an hour with the game, the conclusion made was that while it was obviously a lot less polished and refined than Madden that it was still a solid football game on its own and actually did many things better than EA's game. Well, after a few seasons in the game's franchise mode, a complete year in its season mode, and about 20 or so games in exhibition mode set to a wide array of play options, it can be said with a lot of conviction that GameDay 2001 for PS2 is not as good as Madden and doesn't really come close to competing with it. All the same, the comment about it doing many things better than EA's game still holds true as it does do a lot of things better than Madden, it's just that the stuff that it does worse outweigh it by a large margin.   Gameplay  In the area of gameplay and feature sets, players that have be following the series for the past few years will see that GameDay 2001 on PS2 basically offers the same play modes, options and features. In addition to the basic Exhibition, Season and Franchise (General Manager) modes, players are given the create plays and players. The create-a-play feature is something that's not in Madden and it allows for quite a bit of variety in the plays that can be formulated and the create-a-player option is pretty detailed and even allows for the ability to create a super player with specific attributes that are based on real players. For instance, the user can create a player with Peyton Manning's accuracy, Jeff George's arm strength, Marshall Faulk's speed and so on.   The problem with the game's feature set is that while it contains pretty much everything you'd expect in a football game, it's not quite as robust or detailed as it should be. There's not really a way to adjust roster positions between games, you can't really check player stats and attributes when attempting to re-sign free agents at the onset of the General Manager mode, the draft mode only allows the user to see the players' overall rating and not their scores for specific areas, and the same can be said about the trade player setup.   This isn't to say that the game's completely lacking in its features as it does have a few solid features, including some that you won't find in its competitors. As mentioned previously, there's a cool create-a-play mode and create a super player aspect, but beyond that it's easy to change and edit the names of any player on the roster, which come in real handy when importing players from a saved game from NCAA GameBreaker 2001.Plus, the game provides the user with plenty of adjustable options ranging from the skill of the CPU run defense to its IQ.   While all this is respectable, there's nothing here that's really new to the PS2 version of the game and this trend continues with the game's playability, which is almost completely unchanged from GameDay 2001 on the regular old PlayStation. Ultimately, this is a prettied up version of the PlayStation game complete with all of the bugs and AI problems prevalent in it, plus a few ones that were either not really apparent in the 32-bit game or not there at all.   And when you add these new problems to the many things that have been wrong with the series for the past few years that have yet to be fixed, you end up with a game that's flawed on so many different levels. Yes, the game does contain most of the established gameplay fundamentals that have endeared its fans for years, such as Total Control Passing that allows users to lead receivers more realistically, and the feel of control is pretty much on par with what the series has offered for years, leaning towards are more precise control where abrupt movements can be made without factoring in player momentum. However, even fans of the game's play style can't argue with the fact that there are many problems that have been in the series for years that must be addressed.   For one, ever since the first GameDay on PlayStation, it's always been extremely easy to run the table on the CPU defense, even on the Hall of Fame difficulty level, by simply throwing short passes to backs running out of the backfield. This is still a problem in GameDay 2001 and is actually made worse by a little bug that's in the game that comes up when you throw a pass to a running back that's behind the QB -- when this is done, the QB will go from an overhand throwing motion into an underhand toss and will lob the ball to the intended back, during which the entire defense will dart towards the QB as the throw is being made. The end result is a running back that's always wide open and a guaranteed first down and potential for a touchdown. This bug is also apparent in the version of the game that's on the regular PlayStation, but not in any of the games prior to GameDay 2001.   Beyond just the ability to dominate the CPU with screen and flat passes to the running backs, many of the same money plays that worked with previous versions of the game dating back to GameDay '97 are still pretty effective here in GameDay 2001. In fact, the plays that I used in strategy guides written for EGM for GameDays '98 and '99 (which were both the same), are still money now. The reason that this probably holds true is that the AI hasn't really advanced that well over the years.   The area where this can be seen most clearly is in the routes and patterns that are used by players blocking on offense and by defenders pursuing the ball carriers on defense. The blocking of the offensive line is completely unrealistic and once they reach the end of the initial blocking assignment, they'll move in the same general patterns as the rest of their teammates. This brings forth an unnatural occurrence where you'll see a group of five offensive linemen all moving and making cuts exactly in line with the others and even running down the field and blocking the same defenders. The same thing happens on defense, as defenders will often take the exact same route to the ball carrier, even when it's a situation where the two defenders should approach it differently.   Other problems with the game include defenders who will run towards and then past ball carriers that make a catch in the flat, player animation stopping to catch passes in some cases that cause both the receiver and covering defender to come to a complete stop as the catch animation is being made, a dives and defense that are much too quick and way too powerful. On top of all that, the way the game handles pass defense seems a bit backwards as there's no reason to really take control over the defender to knock down the pass as getting in front of the receiver will generally result in a pass that slips past you for a completion, making it really hard to stop the computer, especially on the Hall of Fame setting. When you add this to the ease of scoring on offense, most Hall of Fame level games end up being high scoring shootouts that could easily go either way.   Graphics  It might not be completely fair to look down on GameDay 2001 in the area of visuals just because it doesn't hold a candle to Madden NFL 2001 because EA Sports' title is pretty much in a league of its own in terms of graphical excellence. Outside of the other EA Sports-developed titles, there aren't really many other games on PlayStation 2 that reach the same level. On the other hand, GameDay 2001 is a direct competitor to Madden and the truth of the situation is that Madden's visuals are superior in almost every single way imaginable.   While the player models in GameDay 2001 are realistically proportioned and have detailed textures, they appear blocky, a bit crude, and a lot less detailed when compared to the one's in Madden. The character animation ranges from magnificent to downright awful. On the magnificent side, the some of the game's tackle animation is the best you'll find in any football game on a console. The tackles actually give the feeling of actual impact as the polygonal models actually make visual contact with each other and the details in some of them are pretty amazing. Defenders will actually wrap their arms around and clamp together the ball carrier's legs to bring them down and it looks remarkably life-like. And many of the transition animations are fairly smooth and all is made even better when you take into account the fact that the game is running at a blistering 60 frames per second.   On the downside, there are many instances where there's either animation that's missing or animation that's just really poorly done. When you move defensive players around the line of scrimmage, they simply move in the direction without any shifting or walking animation. There are also numerous instances where players will catch passes without really looking like they're going after the ball and defenders will often stop and stand straight up and still as the ball flies past them. Similarly, when doing some moves like spin moves while running the ball or swim moves while rushing the passer, the player's forward motion will stop before it goes into the next animation.   Some of these problems are readily apparent in pretty much all football games on the regular PlayStation but weren't really noticeable because you couldn't really see it because the general level of detail was so low. But now that you can see the players more clearly now, these shortfalls are no longer passable and hurt the realism of the product.   Sound  The game's audio is the one area of GameDay 2001 where it seems to hold its own. The commentary job by Phil Simms and Dick Enberg is once again top-notch and it flows better than what's offered by Madden and Summeral in EA Sports' NFL football game. The developers have also done a fine job with using music during the short breaks will the kickoff teams are running onto the field to spice up the atmosphere. While music has been used in the series this way for quite some time, it's not any less effective than it was when it was first implemented and it still gets the job done.   What's more, NFL GameDay 2001 includes an all-new and exclusive feature that the company has coined ~ProTalk,~ that allows the users to see the players and coaches express themselves vocally by shouting out statements after big plays. It doesn't help the gameplay by any means, but the lip-synching is handled well and it does add an extra realistic dimension to the game.

With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. Even though this game has gotten a serious bashing in this review, and deservedly so, I just wanted to make one point clear -- Many of the problems with NFL GameDay 2001 on PlayStation 2 are the same things that have been wrong with the series for the past few years. NFL GameDay has had the same basic set of money plays for at least the last four editions of the game and during that same span it has always been possible to completely dismantle the computer-controlled defense by simply throwing screen passes to your running backs all day, even with the game's difficulty level set to Hall of Fame. Moreover, some of the AI and gameplay bugs that are prevalent in this game are actually in the version of NFL GameDay 2001 on the regular PlayStation. More specifically, the game's most noteworthy bug, which is the one where the quarterback throws the high underhand lob to the running back in the flat who is always wide open, can also be found in 2001 version of the PlayStation game. Nevertheless, the fact that the game's chief problems are carryovers from previous releases of the game doesn't make them any less significant. In fact, it would be reasonable to assume that given the years of experience the developers have had doing football games that it would have been able to fix many of the problems by now. The only reason that I feel the need to point this out is that it's entirely possible that if you've been a fan of GameDay over the past few years that you'll still find enjoyment in this PS2 version because its gameplay is pretty much in line with what the series has offered over the past few years. Just don't pick up GameDay 2001 on PS2 and expect it to be a much-improved version of the series, as it does have some bugs not found in previous releases, it feels like it has been rushed to the market and some of the problems that may have been in previous versions of the game might seem more apparent now that the players are more detailed and easier to see. GameDay 2001 does have some things going for it and it does still play like GameDay has always played, it's just not a solid product and does not have what it takes to compete with Madden.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
