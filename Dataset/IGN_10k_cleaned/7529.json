The game is Naked Sky Entertainment's RoboBlitz, a short but enjoyable sci-fi romp that combines a quirky location and some physics based puzzles to create one of the most enjoyable surprises of the year.  The story's a bit silly and ultimately not very important. It's enough that the premise gets things started and keeps the action going between levels. In short, you're a robot named Blitz whose space station has just come under attack from the dreaded megaNOED. Now you'll have to travel to six different areas of the station to power up the massive Space Cannon and make the megaNOED sorry it ever showed up in the first place.   As you venture from the armory to the radar station to the cooling towers, you'll encounter many of the megaNOED's minions, from arm-twirling nuisance bots to flying wheels of death and even smiling, spherical miniNOEDs. While you can sometimes just shoot the crap out of whatever's in front of you, there are plenty of enemies, particularly towards the beginning and the end of the game, that you'll only be able to beat through cunning and inventiveness. Whether you're beating a tiny robot to death with a barrel or trying to trick a major mechanized menace into hurting itself, RoboBlitz rewards quick thinking as much as quick reflexes.  You'll have a humorous benefactor in the depths of the station who will provide you with a variety of new upgrades. Some you'll have to buy by collecting Upgradium (we totally love the name by the way) throughout the levels. Some he'll just give you because he knows you're going to need it.  The basic rocket launchers and energy guns aren't terribly innovative but the game makes up for it with a  cool hovergun that causes whatever it hits to float up in the air, and a cool point-to-point gun that uses an energy beam to bind two separate objects together. Fire at one object to place the first point, and then fire at another to create the bond. Though it takes a while to figure out interesting applications for both of these guns, they definitely reward a little experimentation.   Each wing of the station presents a variety of puzzles that need to be solved in order to power up the cannon. Though the solutions to each puzzle are very specific, you are given some liberty in how to you about accomplishing that objective. In one level, you have to feed material into a metal shredder in order to make the bullets for the space cannon. We started out grabbing barrels and crates and dropping them onto the conveyor belt but soon realized that we could kill two birds with one stone by waiting until our flying enemies were over a conveyor belt and then zapping them with an EMP burst. If they stayed unconscious long enough, they fell right into the shredder all on their own.      In another level, you have to raise up a platform that's resting on one end of a giant lever. You can either pile loads of crates on the opposite end of the lever to weight it down, or  you can use your point-to-point beam or hovergun to lift up the platform by itself. There are so many options to solve the puzzles that we almost wish there were more ways to approach the overall obstacles on a level. In other words, perhaps build in a solution to the problem that doesn't require the player to use the platform at all.  You can take advantage of the game's physics system and the point-to-point beam to play around with the environment. One of my favorite tricks is to chain up six barrels top to bottom and use them like a giant serpentine. Though you need a lot of space to use the barrel chain as a weapon, it's definitely worth it if you can get a lot of enemies together in a large, open space. Even when you're not fighting the barrel chain can be quite fun, especially if you start using the hovergun to lift some of the barrels into the air.   Later in the game, the point-to-point tool will be upgraded so that one end of the beam will be attached to Blitz himself. With this new upgrade, you can use the beam to pull lighter objects toward you from across the room. If the beam is attached to a heavier object, Blitz will be pulled towards that object. While it's useful for getting out of trouble in a jiff, the beam can also be used to reach inaccessible areas of the station. In fact, one entire wing is completely off limits until you obtain this upgrade.  Though you're not going to swinging around the room like Spider-Man, you can definitely use your momentum to your advantage here. Using the point-to-point beam to launch yourself into some of the levels' tiny openings will require careful timing and a good sense of space. There are several levels where you'll be forced to use the beam to travel through a complicated environment. Once you learn how to use it right, you'll really start to enjoy these sequences.   The places where RoboBlitz is weakest are the moments where it tries to be a shooter. Sure, there's a range of weapons here and no shortage of enemies to use them on but the shooter mechanics are just awkward. Homing rockets and energy pulses certainly work well enough but they're a bit out of place here and don't feel quite right, physically or conceptually.   RoboBlitz makes use of the new Unreal 3 engine and it looks simply gorgeous. The textures were the first thing we noticed. Every single surface in this game has a credible sense of weight and depth. You can actually see real textures on these textures. The glossy sheen on the conveyor belts, the blotchy surface of the pipes, the silvery glint on the railgun bullets -- all these items seem more real because of the excellent texture work.  In fact, the whole visual flair of the game is nicely stylized while still retaining a sense of believability. The robots are wacky -- particularly your legless helper and the NOEDs themselves. Sure, some of the designs are a little blocky, mostly because the game seems to throw circles, spheres and tubes into every single scene, but the overall effect is very good.      The lighting is also phenomenal. Objects glow with an obvious power and weapons fire lights up an area like the Fourth of July. There are honest-to-goodness highlights on the characters so instead of just seeing brighter versions of the base colors, you'll see washed out areas when the light is really strong. There are loads of other subtle effects, from realistic looking haze to billowing smoke.  The only things that detract from the overall effect of the visuals are the pool of lava and some of the weapons effects. The lava just looks like a trippy velvet comforter on a waterbed. Next to the other visuals, it just isn't convincing enough. It's the same problem with the weapons, particularly the fireworks effect. It just looks a bit too stylized to fit in with the rest of the graphics. Still, these are very minor complaints about an otherwise beautiful game.   It seems to run fairly well too. Even at 1280 with all the details turned up, we were able to get very solid framerates. To be sure, there's some slowdown when things get hectic but RoboBlitz actually runs much better than games that don't look half as good.  Good sound work supplements the visuals. With the new engine, the game can drive its sounds based on the physics engine. Try scraping a box across the floor or dropping several barrels at once and you'll really be able to experience the connection between the objects in the game and the sounds coming out of your speakers. A nice range of weapons sounds and a suitable moody score add to the experience but don't stand out enough to really be noticed on their own.  You can grab the game for only $14.99 from the RoboBlitz website. You can also grab a short demo there if you prefer.   Right now the two biggest things going for this game are the fifteen-dollar price tag and the new Unreal engine. Games at that price are just never this beautiful. While the action elements leave a bit to be desired, the creative level design and intriguing puzzles carry you through the weaker FPS-style moments. You can run through this one in a matter of hours rather than days, it's a trip well worth taking, especially if you like using your abilities to monkey around with the environment.", "date": "Nov 8, 2006"}
