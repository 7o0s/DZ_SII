At least on PlayStation and PS2, only Metal Gear Solid 1 & 2 and the Tenchu series seriously approached stealth as a core design element. Thankfully, after Io-Interactive's mixed success with Hitman on PC, Eidos green-lighted the second for PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC, to give console gamers a taste of the intelligent, stealthy play. And I'm oh so happy they did, because Hitman 2 nails its mark.   Based entirely around stealth, sniping and an intelligent approach to solving each mission, Hitman 2 takes stealth to heart, putting gamers into the position of a tough-as-nails assassin seeking out moral and spiritual justification. Gamers are in for a challenging, deep and classy affair with Io-Interactive's second in the series which, by no means gets everything right, but digs deep down into the concept of stealth with a huge variety of missions and makes you work for the win.    Story  Hitman 2 takes players into the world of high-level government conspiracies, diplomatic imbroglios and millionaire businessmen with a penchant for illegal activities. After his brilliant career as a paid assassin, Agent 47 has hung up his guns for good. The beginning of the game tells of a mysterious group of men in search of his talents, but then shows Agent 47 in plainclothes working at a Church in Sicily. He confesses to the local priest, who sees how he is trying to change his life, tending to the church garden, giving healthy amounts of money to the church, and showing signs of a man who's genuinely made a turn for the good.    Quickly, however, the priest is abducted, prompting Agent 47 to search him out, fully armed and now more personally involved than ever before. He dials up Diana from the ~Agency,~ who exchanges his skills for their resources, and in the time Agent 47 completes numerous missions for them, the Agency and he eke out clues to the whereabouts of his newfound friend. The game follows Agent 47's slow discovery process to save his new friend.   In his travels, Agent 47 ventures all over the world, starting in Sicily, Italy, flying to St. Petersburg, Russia, traveling to Japan, Malaysia, Nuristan, India, and finally revisiting St. Petersburg. The game provides plenty of missions, 20 in all, and each one can be replayed employing several different strategies. Well-handled cutscenes, introductory clips, and several spy-style photos, hand-held movies, and background articles provide you with the pieces of the puzzle for each new assignment.    Gameplay  Hitman 2 may not take place in ancient Japan like in Tenchu, or involve sophisticated war machines to power its coolness (like Metal Gear in Metal Gear), but what it doesn't have in those areas, it makes up for in others. Starting with just a few simple weapons, Agent 47 gradually acquires the weapons he finds from his victims, which are then saved for use in the next level. In some cases, the game cheats a little, giving you weapons required for the next level, too. Agent 47 eventually acquires a huge arsenal of weapons, including a knife, various .44s and magnums, anesthetic, hardballers, hardballers silenced, 9 mm handguns and 9 mm silence handguns, colts, a sniper rifle, AK 47s, MP5s, shotguns, SMG (submachine guns), silenced .22s, and the Spas 12 shotgun. He also acquires ninja swords, axes, fiber wire and crossbows.    The sniper rifle features an exceedingly slick interface with sophisticated looking crosshairs and a significant amount of your own breathing to counter the supposed ease of pegging a vulnerable target. The weapons are moderately easy to switch to and from, although if I were to criticize this game, at least one of the areas I'd start is the weapon selection mechanism. (But I'll get to that later.) And you can carry a health amount of weapons, too, including for instance, a sniper rifle or an AK rifle in one hand, while a handgun or hand weapon in the other. The shotgun, ballers and magnums provide a fierce physical response from the targets that may fly 10 feet back when tagged. The ninja sword is an awful lot of fun to use, too, as are the burly crossbow and, surprisingly, the fiber wire. When out of ammo, Agent 47 used his weapons to attack his enemies. In all, the weapon cache is healthy and satisfying, giving gamers the happy tools of the assassin trade, along with less ordinary items that make the game just that much more fun.    Delivered in a first- and third-person perspectives, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin sets up mission after mission of stealth-style gameplay, providing players with numerous ways to beat a level, which is what makes this game so damn good, so wonderfully replayable, and so likeably intelligent in design. Gamers may find that the levels are often difficult at first, but after much trial and error, the game level design becomes clear. For instance, in the Kirov Park Meeting mission, Agent 47 must remove two high-level people, a government official and his contact, and he's given only a few minutes to do it in. The level is circular in design, and around it are armed guards, a few manholes into which you can descend, and at least one church tower from which to snipe enemies. The trick is that you can probably complete the mission in at least two if not three or four ways. You can snipe the men from the tower, or you can plant explosives on the cars of the targets and then take out the limousine driver to escape. Seems easy at first, but it's actually harder than it sounds.    What makes Hitman 2 so deep and clever, however, is that it's not just designed with one primary path, with a secondary path thrown in for good measure. In many but not all missions, it's democratically open in design. And you're highly encouraged to retry levels again and again. At the end of each mission, players are rated and provided with numerous statistics. You receive a ranking, with names like ~mass murderer~ and ~ninja master,~ and your shots are recorded. So you know how many head shots you delivered, how many times you were discovered, set off alarms, were hit by bullets, how many people (be they enemies, innocents or the like) were involved, and so on. A handy horizontal chart demonstrates your aggression, stealth and timeliness, too. Another nice function is that ability enables players go back and re-try any of the previous levels. While you may save over an old file, the game gives you the choice to select from any of the previous ones to retry.    The AI is tough and unforgiving. And I mean that as a compliment. Guards and enemies see you and they warn everyone around. Warnings sound and you're screwed. They hide behind walls, too, acting somewhat intelligently if they know you're around. Often times, guards will look at you strangely as you walk by in a sneaky suit (of which there are many great ones), and those folks you track too closely will occasionally look back in paranoia. I would go so far as to say that the AI is often too tough, forcing players to restart the mission, but when I wasn't frustrated by it, I was happy to have the challenge.   Improvements made in the second game are much applauded here. While it may seem like normal everyday stuff, the first game didn't have some crucial elements in it that make this version more usable and interface-friendly. Gamers play most of the game from a default third-person perspective, but can easily switch it to a first-person perspective (changeable by depressing R3). It permits a reasonable amount of mid-game saves, which wasn't possible in the previous game, and which helps dramatically to keep the frustration level down. (Although it's not really necessary until the later, larger levels.) And it offers an improved inventory system, so gamers can carry weapons from one level to the next.       Perhaps the downfalls of Hitman 2 are just as important as the glowing parts. The camera system in the third-person perspective is handled with a rigid, panhandle camera that follows every single move or turn that Agent 47 moves. It doesn't loosely follow Agent 47, but feels stiff, slow and clunky. On the other hand, the first-person perspective is nearly perfect. After playing in first-person mode, I doubt few will choose the clunky, slow third-person perspective.    The weapon system is also a handful. Perhaps it's easier on the PC version, but the controller layout for the PS2 takes some time to get used to, and the learning curve is often a bumpy road. Complicating this issue is that Hitman 2 is not devised as a close combat game, but a sniper game. Yes, you do indeed get into face-to-face combat, but it's not pretty. Agent 47 moves slowly and mechanically, with moderately steady response from the controller. It's designed to be slow, but unfortunately, this particular design doesn't work well for anything that includes getting into trouble. Switching weapons, strafing, running, and just about everything else in Io-Interactive's game is slow and deliberate.    Sure, that's the hitman's way, and sure, you're supposed to do things stealthily, but more than 50% of the game involves figuring things out from your mistakes, and the game punishes you with its controls so that you return to the game and play it stealthily. Should Io-Interactive speed the game way up? Nah, but a slightly looser, more fluid control system, a looser camera, and a faster, easier way to switch weapons would make this game so much less annoying. Also, while it's challenging to learn the hitman's stealthy ways, this game is based around a concretely trial-and-error style of gameplay. Mess up? Just restart. There are no health pickups in the game and if you're attacked by a mob, survival is highly unlikely.    At the same time, the levels are strangely if not entirely well balanced. In the mission Tracking Hayamoto, I was able to survive an unbelievable onslaught of attacks. I walked into that level, took a beating, shot Hayamoto, killed everyone around him, and walked out in less than five minutes with 1/100ths of my health. I should not have been able to do it. I'm sort of proud, but it was a sloppy way to beat a level, and I experienced none of its subtleties or depth. Needless to say, the game's AI balance could be slightly better tuned.    Graphics  While I have seen some rough early builds, the final version is a clean, artfully envisioned game filled with tasteful graphic touches. It runs at a crisp 60 fps, giving players high-resolution backgrounds, textures and highly detailed characters. The character design is original, with Agent 47 being a hard-browed bald man, and numerous enemy characters showing a variety of facial shapes. (For some reason I especially like the early level featuring the rotund, round-faced postman and the delivery boy.) And when you zoom in with the sniper rifle, you can clearly see the distinct features on characters' faces, lending to the game's authenticity.     What is particularly intriguing is the architectural design. With such a large array of countries involved, the art team went out of its way to depict the cultural variations of dwellings, embassies, castles, mansions and the like with ornate detail and architectural accuracy. Perhaps the buildings are just guessed at or close approximations, but the end-all result is an excellent set of great looking buildings, a colorful, oft-changing color palette ranging from mission to mission, and great building design all around.    The special effects are also better than average. In the cathedral the lighting effects create a visibly realistic shaft of light that's beautiful to behold. In Hidden Valley, the falling snow and wind drifts create an immensely powerful effect of being in a distinctly cold, wintry environment. And in the very first level, Anathema, the hot Sicilian countryside is represented with great textures, an superb looking mansion, and a warmly colored sky and background that creates a humid, warm atmosphere.    Sound  In the same line as Electronic Arts' Medal of Honor series, Io-Interactive chose the road less taken by creating original, serious, and classical music specifically for this game. The result is an excellent set of compositions that are worth appreciating on their own. With music composed by Jesper Kid and played by The Budapest Symphony Orchestra and Choir, the game soundtrack recalls themes from the movie The Godfather and various other mature movies.    The game's sound effects are equally impressive. Hooked up to a good stereo, Hitman 2 will put a strange paradoxical effect in your ear. Just as in the The Godfather, gamers will experience exquisite classical music while some kind of murder or betrayal occurs simultaneously. For those who enjoy a good mature soundtrack, far from the pinking, beeping sounds of past arcade games, Hitman is definitely your game.   While the awkward controls and trial-and-error gameplay design might deter some gamers, Hitman 2 is deep with the kind of gameplay that stealth and shooter gameplayers have been craving for on PS2. It's almost entirely open in design, with some levels reaching close to brilliance in their layout and endless variations, and it'll give you reason to play the same mission again and again just to see what works and what doesn't. For those PlayStation 1 and 2 owners who loved the Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu series, Hitman 2 is an excellent addition to the stealth library. It's tough, challenging, classily design, and it's filled with a high level of production from the music to the graphics to the game story itself.", "date": "Oct 2, 2002"}
