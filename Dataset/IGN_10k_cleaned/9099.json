Well, the Surgeon General has certified California Games for the Atari Lynx as a completely safe way to get your sand-coated jollies. This is an adaptation of the Epyx home computer game, and allows one to four players to compete in a number of ~sport~ contests for points and bragging rights.  Note: The instruction manual says that California Games only allows for 1 or 2 players. ComLynxing three or four players is possible, but tricky -- don't give up if it doesn't work initially.  There are four events in California Games. The BMX bike race is a run through a hilly, obstacle-infested course as fast as possible. Surfing lets you hit the waves, doing stunts like riding the tube or 360-degree spins before running out of time. Similarly, halfpipe skateboarding gives you a time limit to try and perform as many handplants and aerial turns as possible. Finally, you can play with the footbag, which consists of keeping a small beanbag airborne using only your feet -- style counts.   California Games is a card for beginning video players. The individual games are fun at first, but all of them are fairly easy, and most dedicated gamers will master them in a short period of time. This is especially noticeable when playing by yourself, and the game soon becomes an exercise in ~can I beat my previous score?~. More contests would have helped, as well as options to adjust the difficulty or a ~tournament~ consisting of all events.  There's nothing wrong with California Games; there's just not much to recommend, either. Playing with other people makes it more enjoyable -- the competition is head-to-head, and you must adjust your strategies for opponents who are trying to trip you, run you over, or crash into your latest stunt. This is good for some cheap laughs, but the lack of real depth in the gameplay keeps it from retaining any permanent appeal.  The sound and graphics in California Games are a good indication of what the Lynx is capable of. Color, hue, and animation are used well throughout, providing realistic-looking backgrounds and characters. The scrolling is smooth, and there are a few graphic treats, like the semi-transparent tube in Surfing, and the camera zoom in/zoom out on the Halfpipe.  Sounds are also commendable, with quality music and noises everywhere. Each game has its own, distinctive soundtrack, and the title theme music is suitably bouncy. Similarly, sound effects are appropriately used, each one properly coordinated for the current on-screen action.  It's understandable why Atari includes California Games in the deluxe Lynx packages: It's easy, varied, non-violent (have to placate worried parents, you know), looks and sounds well, and ComLynxable. However, with only four basic games available, most players will want a tougher challenge soon enough. If you don't already own California Games, you may want to consider a different title.", "date": "Jul 7, 1999"}
