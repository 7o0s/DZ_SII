Capcom's Tech Romancer, the US version of the game known in Japan as Kikaioh (or, as IGNPSX editor David Smith insists, Choukousenki KIKAIOH!!!!!!!!! - see this clip) is the ultimate fighting experience for the animation fans out there, and an enjoyable one on one fighter in its own right. Tech Romancer works, from the start, like basically any other fighting game, with your selecting from nine different warriors and heading out for any number of rounds of one on one fighting.  The warriors aren't humans or aliens, though.  Nope, you're taking control of giant mechs, which according to the game's background story are being piloted by between one and five pilots.  The fighting is completely dissimilar from Virtual On, resembling more closely a standard Capcom fighter in that it takes place from a side-view perspective.  Each robot has various moves, ranging from projectiles to close-up blows, along with special moves achieved via button combinations - you know the drill.  There are all sorts of unique elements to the game that differentiate it from the standard Capcom fighter, though.  The fights, first off, take place in 3D space, somewhat like Power Stone, although movement feels more limited and the backgrounds have the bare minimum of interaction.  It's certainly a nice touch, though, and by running around the backgrounds in your mech, you can in some stages squash buildings in order to pick up offensive and defensive power-up items, which can be stored and used later.  Character energy meters are also different from the norm.  The meters are, to begin, on the sides of the screen as opposed to on top.  Any fighting fan will, of course, tell you that this is without question the biggest change in human history!  The game actually refers to the energy meters as damage meters, and as you take a beating, the meters go up instead of depleting (this represents how Capcom views the cup as half full instead of half empty).  You can sneak away from the action for a while to heal up some of your damage, but if the damage gets the better of you, it's round over for you and your pilots.  In Tech Romancer, damage isn't refilled between rounds, and the fight continues in another part of the stage, without pause.  Capcom clearly did research on how to keep the energy high during a fight.  Characters have final attack moves which, while difficult to connect, can terminate a weak opponent and give the attacker an amazing rush.  You'll also find paper-rock-scissors weapons clashes ala Soul Edge.  These aren't as dramatic, and I'm still not sure how to get them consistently (something that I commented on in my review of the import from a loooooooong time back), but the rush is just as huge as it was with the Namco classic.  Expect your multiplayer matches, where all your goofball friends are around watching (uhh, you internet denizens do occasionally play games in large groups, don't you?) to erupt in periodic shouts of excitement.  To be honest (I'd actually prefer to lie and tell everyone to buy this game, as it's ultra cool), the fighting system isn't necessarily the greatest thing out there - it's certainly no Soul Calibur in terms of fluidity, or Virtua Fighter in terms of complexity (Mentor: Remember, Anoop-san, make attempt to please everyone, lest you receive hate mail).  The 3D movement, as mentioned above, is somewhat awkward, and you never get as solid a sense of control as you'd like.  And although all fighters can be thought of as button mashers for the inexperienced, this is even more the case for Tech Romancer, and the lack of a training mode doesn't help one bit.  Finally, the game has a bit of half-ass to it - an armor system that's totally under-used.  But for what it is, the fighting system works out just dandy, and the game's intended audience - people like me, David Smith and former Saturn World editor in chief Jeff Chen - have something else to hold their attention: the mechs.  Folks, anime mechs kick much ass and take names to follow, whether they be from  Evangelian, Gundam, Gunbuster, Macross, or any of the more obscure series that David Smith has stored up in his zany brain.  The mechs in Tech Romancer can be taken as parodies of mechs from these and other series, and going through the game's one player story mode will surround you in a pseudo animation episode, complete with a title, an eye catch, and voiced story sequences between fights (these are in Japanese with English subtitles for the US version, purists).  The game suffers a bit from its old arcade hardware roots, with pixelated graphics that take a bit away from the presentation (boy what I wouldn't give for a cell-shaded version of this using the DC's full power), but it's hard to think of another fighter with such a huge focus on story.  And whether or not you love the anime influences, you'll find yourself going through this and the other one player mode numerous times, thanks to the awesome Power Stone-style rewards system in the game.  By playing the game's story mode, or a challenge mode in which you fight twelve opponents one after the other, you can unlock VMU mini games, secret characters, and art galleries.  Even better, replaying the story mode is an absolute joy thanks to the inclusion of branching paths.  Every now and then, you're given the option of making the story progress in different ways, with your choice determining the next fight.  Your actions in a fight can also contribute to the path, and if you have trouble keeping up with what you have and haven't seen, you can open up an option to view all branching path points for each character.  It's easily the best single player mode ever in a fighting game, and when combined with the animation references, make this a must have for anyone who can sing the theme songs to Robotech and Star Blazers (or their Japanese equivalents).  For gamers in general too, the game should offer up hours of fun as a Capcom fighter that stands out from the pack.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 20, 2000"}
