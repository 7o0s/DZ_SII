The space battles with the merciless Cylons are certainly good inspirado for a top-down shooting game -- so why doesn't In-Fusio's blaster exactly make the cut?   The problem here is enemy repetition. While In-Fusio serves up wave after wave of Cylon fighters for you to blast out of the cosmos, after a few levels of making scrap of these inter-galactic enemies, you've really seen all there is to see. Unlike Star Trek, which has multiple alien races to draw from -- Romulans, Borg, Klingon, etc. -- Battlestar Galactica mainly focuses on just the Cylons. And that makes good television drama, but vids (especially shooters) need a variety of enemies to keep gamers engaged. Imagine Raidant Silvergun or Darius with only a couple ship models. I don't care how ingenious the patterns and formations are, I'm always looking to blow up the next big thing.   Variety, however, does come from mission structures. The game starts off with a basic top-down vertical level -- and after finally plowing through it (and a good 100 Cylon ships), I confess I was a little sad about having to plough through 19 more levels of the same. Thankfully, Battlestar Galactica offers another scheme on certain levels -- 360 degree combat not entirely unlike the arcade classics Sinistar and Time Pilot. You steer your ship every which way but loose, trying to take down -- wait for it -- more Cylons. The designer does shake this up even further by giving missions different objectives, such as collecting objects floating in the void or taking down a set number of ships.   Controlling the 360 sequences takes a little getting used to, but once you have the hang of it, you'll be fine. (Your ship's shield helps lessen the ordeal.) I did have issue with the auto-fire, though -- especially in the vertical scrolling segments. It fires in short bursts, and the bullets are spaced apart a little too far. Earning the bonuses for taking down an entire stream of Cylons is nigh impossible, because the spacing between the last shot in the auto-fire burst and the first in the next is too big. A Cylon always slips through.   Battlestar Galactica looks the part of the top-down shooter. Your Viper ship and the Cylon fighters are very recognizable. I'm not even a big fan of the show, but I was able to make the connection. There are no actor likenesses in the game, as you are cast as a lowly new pilot working his way up through the ranks. The backdrops are appropriately spacey, such as flying over scenes of cosmic vastness or strafing over a major ship. I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson 710. The visuals are crisp and clean, but do nothing to advance the ball. (Not that the ball always needs to be advanced -- but it's always nice when it happens.)  Battlestar Galactica is likely to appeal to the show's surprisingly large fan base, but I suspect traditional shooter fans will get a little restless after several levels of shooting down the same enemies. The game presents a little variety through the different objectives, but I confess it wasn't enough to hold my interest. This was definitely one of those games where it settled into work rather than fun.", "date": "Apr 19, 2006"}
