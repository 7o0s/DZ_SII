Who would've thought that Acclaim's All-Star Baseball 2001 would've been one of them? There's a major drought of great games on the way and ASB 2001 finds itself in the peculiar position of bridging the gap between the powerful Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the great crop of Nintendo published games, including Excitebike 64 and Perfect Dark, that are on the way.  High Voltage, the people behind Lego Racers, handled development duties and we presume they were simply given the old code leftover from last year and a command to ~make it better.~ And that's just what they did. ASB 2001 is still the familiar baseball game that we've played before but there are enough new features and things to look at it to satisfy nitpicky baseball fanatics and casual sports gamers alike.  The New Features for 2001<br   Coopertown Legends team is chock full of living baseball legends like Yogi Berra, Willie Stargell and Reggie Jackson. We'd simply call it a team full of living Hall of Famers but that would be disrespectful to Pete Rose. The Cooperstown Legends team needs a homefield, so how about an outdoor cornfield stadium like the one Kevin Costner's insane character in ~Field of Dreams~ constructed. Improved arcade mode streamlines the batting and pitching of the regular games. Reminiscent of some old 8 and 16-bit baseball titles where you just pitch and hit with minimal control. New effects give the Arcade Mode a different feel from the Simulation Mode. Batting Practice Mode gives players a nice safe way to get used to ASB 2001's sophisticated batting and pitching controls.   The Features You Know and Love   Every team in Major League Baseball and 700 players from the Players Association. Every Major League Stadium including new ballparks in Detroit, Houston and San Francisco. Scouting reports from cover boy Derek Jeter. Realistic player models include faces and authentic team uniforms. Motion captured animations including over-the-shoulder catches and celebrations. Exhaustive details like sunglasses, high socks, alternate uniforms and dust clouds on the field. Instant Replay. More than 100 unique batting stances like Frank Thomas' bat-on-shoulder and Darryl Strawberry's kick. Advanced A.I. accounts for day vs night, grass vs turf and home vs away and affects player performances. Batting interface has adjustable sweet spot and option for power or contact hitting.    Gameplay Improving on a sports game, a baseballer at that, is a tall order given the gaming public's assumption that it will basically be the same game with a few updated stats. High Voltage has squeezed a few new tricks out of the old dog called baseball.  The Arcade Quickplay mode, not to be confused with the simple Quickplay, is a great addition to a game that was about as sim as you can get. You get two randomly chosen teams, pick your side and go at it. Amazingly this mode is the most fun because it strips away all of the features the older games included. No pitching/batting interface, or all of that in-game micro managing. Just select your pitch and fire away. If you're batting just close your eyes, swing for the fences and hope for the best. The coolest part about this mode is the after pitch control system. You don't have the little aiming dot anymore so you sort of just guide the pitch where you want it to go after your pitcher lets go of it. With the simple mechanics and awesome arcade style motion trails on the ball and bat, the Arcade Quickplay mode is like a grown-up version of the old school ~big head~ baseball games on the NES.  The Batting Practice Mode is a great idea as well that merely required a tweaking of the already established Home Run Derby Mode. In HRD the ball was indeed juiced to allow for more homers, plus anything that didn't go out was an out. This is not a good way to learn ASB's sophisticated batting system. In Batting Practice you just pick your guy, set the number of swings he'll get, tell the pitcher how you want 'em and start hitting them to all fields. A very functional practice mode that allows you to learn to hit any kind of pitch.  The addition of the Cooperstown Legends is a nice touch. This licensing vehicle allows N64 owners to play the game of baseball the way it was meant to be with a star studded field of living Hall of Famers. There's no Mays or Aaron, but it still feels cool to use Reggie Jackson, Joe Morgan and Ernie Banks like you would any other player. Of course the Legends need a homefield and their cornfield is a very clever idea, but it loses its luster quickly. We kept waiting for Shoeless Joe Jackson to come walking out of the cornfield, but it's solid just like a regular outfield wall so he never showed up.  We've covered the major new features that ASB 2001 offers over its predecessors but there are still a few annoying habits left over in this franchise. Since all of the animation isn't always in sync, there will be times when a baserunner appears to be safe but is actually called out because to the computer AI, the base is still a few feet away. Likewise a batted ball that looks foul will be fair or vice versa. We got used to all of these things with the first ASB, but to see that there still there is a bit frustrating because we finally thought we'd get a chance to play the game like we see it.   One more nit to pick is Acclaim's unfulfilling use of the MLB license. There are far too many generic logos on menu screens where the smiling faces of real Major Leaguers ought to be. Also, we're pretty sure Roger Clemens won 14 games for the Yankees last year, so we were a bit confused to see the precious roster photo of him wearing a Blue Jays hat. For some of the more recent trades and free agent moves it's understandable, but there's no reason for guys to be wearing old hats from two years ago. The Rocket isn't the only one who's looking retro in the game either.  Graphics Brilliant. As good as the original ASB looked, 2001 looks about 10% better, if we had to put a number on it. The players look and move much smoother with a lot of the seems barely showing up. The stadiums are the real benchmark, however and they look absolutely amazing.   The player faces are a lot sharper so that you can actually recognize guys like Derek Bell, with his distinct walrus moustache, and Mark McGwire without reading the screen. You can see the different physical attributes like the ripped arms of the team's slugger and the giant ass of the overweight middle reliever. All very well done.  The animations are darn near top notch. There was one particular fielder's choice that looked so good in live action that we spent minutes in the replay mode making sure we actually saw what we thought we saw. The throw home got to the plate just in time and the catcher got the tag down just in time to get the runner and it wasn't because of any cheesy AI either. This is the final connection that a baseball title like this needs to make if players are going to get into the game. If it doesn't play as real as it looks then you're offering a pretty hollow experience.   There's still some hitches here and there in the animation, but the nature of baseball and the distant camera angles make it easy to mask. When run through the instant replay mode, you can see the same ~stray~ frames of animation that we saw in the dreadful QBC 2000.   The stadiums are so great because they have gotten the details down almost perfectly. At Wrigley Field you can see and actually read the bedsheet sign in left field telling Sammy Sosa that he's ~the man.~ The giant Coke bottle at Tuner Field is accurately reproduced. The tarp-covered empty seats at Pro Player stadium are in there. The mowed patI admit I took last year off and didn't get into ASB 2000 like I did the previous game. I was aware of all the new features however and the 2001 edition is a big enough improvement in my opinion. The new gameplay modes are really worth it if you want more out of your N64 baseball gaming. You get the same incredible depth and info already built into the ASB series with some nice light alternatives to keep things interesting.Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to give the game enough of a workout to detect the old stat bug that's haunted the previous two versions. We do recommend using an officially licensed Nintendo save device so that the game has every chance of carrying your season stats through the end of the year.Overall, ASB 2001 is still the standard when it comes to baseball on the N64. It's quite an accomplishment for Acclaim to have warded off EA Sports, Konami and even Nintendo itself in the baseball genre this year. High Voltage could've easily gotten away with rolling out the same game as last year but the effort they've put into ASB 2001 shows and it's worth it.", "date": "Mar 31, 2000"}
