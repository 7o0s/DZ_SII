First, look past the rewards they get from the first game, such as the company-sponsored vacations to the Caribbean and the complimentary Porsche each staff member gets for every one million units sold. Ignore the spoils of success, and you'll see that these folks have an unenviable task ahead of them. For with all of the gold and the glory comes the snake in the grass - making the inevitable sequel.    Thankfully, the makers of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 (GRAW2) look like they've pulled off a double whammy with this one. This sequel takes all that was great about the first game, and then shows what the devs have learnt after twelve more months of playing with the 360's oozy innards. But can it recapture the oomph of the first game, considering that at its core it's still all about zooming around in Black Hawks, shooting the occasional Mexican rebel with your high-powered rifle?      The game follows on directly after the events of the first title. Once again you inhabit the well-worn and slightly smelly boots of Scott Mitchell, the toughest sonofagun this side of Guantanamo Bay. Those pesky Mexican rebels are at it again, staging yet another uprising against the US. Only this time it's fuelled by a few cheap black market nukes. It's your job to save the world all over again and yadda, yadda, yadda.   It's easy to overlook most of the story - in fact, it's quite hard to focus the damn thing. We tried to keep up with the videos that were displayed on our HUD and on in-game TV screens. However, we were usually so distracted by the cool scenery passing by that by the time we were pulling the trigger we didn't have a clue why we were about to kill the man in our sites. Kinda like real soldiers, you could say.    At its core, the game's mechanics are identical to the last. If you're one of the seven 360 owners worldwide who never bought the original, it's played from an over-the-shoulder, third person perspective, although the option to play from an inside-the-skull, first person view is included. The game fits squarely into the tactical shooter genre. While the occasional solo mission is thrown in for variety, on most missions you'll be accompanied by three other troops, who are more than happy to run into harm's way if you so desire. Thankfully, they no longer do it of their own accord, provided you use their new ability to stay in recon mode. Use this mode and they won't fire back at sighted enemies unless they absolutely must. Instead they'll quietly move to your chosen hidey hole, reporting accurately on enemy movement courtesy of their new voice prompts.    These voice prompts are surprisingly accurate. They'll tell you how many enemies are in sight, which direction they're from and what they're hiding behind. Most of the time it works smoothly, although occasionally your squad is a bit slow at reporting in. Still, it definitely makes them better at providing situational awareness. We're sure it wasn't easy to program this system, so the lack of a few more random taunts from your team mates is odd. A few battle cries along the lines of ~Eat my death, disenfranchised people of the developing world~ would go a long way to give them an even more human feel.   Why do bad guys always have to go to war in such scenic locations?  They're also quite a smart bunch - definitely a big step up from the bumbling buffoons in the last game, who often found themselves outwitted and outplayed by a three foot fence. Our squaddies in GRAW2 only got hung up on obstacles a handful of times, and were much better at taking cover. With some smart positioning on our behalf, our squad mates rarely got blown away.    Once you've got your ghosts in position, a quick tap of the Left Bumper switches them to ~Destroy everything with a pulse~ mode, and they'll open up on anything around them. This stealth/attack system works really well, allowing you to set your team up in a tactically strong position before unleashing fire and brimstone on the enemy.   In fact, maybe it works a little too well - we found the single player campaign was markedly easier than the first game, with very few moments that we had to repeat. This could also be a result of the new medic class, who can heal you up to six times during a single mission. Whatever the reason, the challenge level on the medium difficulty is a bit of a pushover, so we're keen to play through again on the hardest difficulty. Experienced gamers can kiss the single player campaign goodbye after about eight or nine hours on medium; which is around the standard for this kind of game. There's plenty of other content to keep you killing though, provided you're on Live. More about that in a bit.     As well as your trusty ghost sidekicks, you'll also have access to support units in the form of armoured vehicles, attack choppers, air strikes, UAVs and armoured vehicles. The big new unit, the mule, is aptly named - mules are boring, unloved creatures, aren't they? It's simply a weapons locker on wheels, and while handy, isn't much fun. Thankfully it doesn't detract from the rest of the game.   These support units and your squad mates all share the Cross-Com 2.0 system, which is like an invisible battlefield internet, but is used to share battle data rather than porn. Its new sequel-tastic improvement is its ability to expand the view from each unit to a full screen view, and then command the unit from that view. You can complete an entire level using your squad mates from this viewpoint, and it proved very useful with the UAV, giving us a gods-eye view of the battlefield. Viewing from vehicles was also a great way of picking out the best targets. Not only is it useful, it's a gorgeous way of sizing up the battlefield.    You'll need to size it up frequently, as the level design in GRAW2 is significantly more complicated than its predecessor. Multiple routes now offer more options to approach fire-fights, and the maps are much hillier than in the past. These open up nice vantage points for sniping enemies while watching over your squad.    Who says on-rails sections aren't fun. Whack a chain-gun in and they're super awesome!  Even though US towns are now included as battle zones, much of the game is set in very similar environments to the first game. That is, sandy deserts and decrepit Mexican towns and cities. Thankfully the improved graphics mean that these environments still seem fresh, reaching a whole new level of realism.    Ahh, the improved graphics. You've seen the screens, you've watched the high res movies on our site. And some of you are probably thinking, gee, that looks a lot like the first game. You're right - it does. Thing is, the first game is still one of the sexiest games on any platform, and in the sequel it's even slicker.    Textures are sharper, and there are far fewer jaggies to be seen at long range. Smoke now reacts to the wind - be it a gently whooshing breeze or the frenzied whump whump of a chopper blade. The detail in everything seems to have been pumped up - there are more buildings in the fly-by scenes, more vehicles in the battles, more troops in the fire-fights.   Your soldiers are also intricately detailed, down the monocle used to display the Cross-com system. Bullet trails, while not realistic, add to the frenzy of battles - during particularly busy fights the sky is covered with their smoky trails. And the explosions. Oh, the explosions. Best ever? You betcha - with their mushroom clouds, roaring fireballs and showers of debris, they make your C4 pack or air-strike feel truly sack-shrinking.    Yet another explosion. Strangely enough, there's plenty of these in the game.  Lighting effects have also been improved, using a handful of techniques that would confuse even Einstein, making for more realistic glow and shadow effects. Speaking of the shadows, they're probably the only issue we have with the game's visuals. The difference between shadow and light is a bit too much, making it very hard to spot anything hiding in the shadows. It's not so bad in single player, where the Cross-com icons help pick enemies out, but online it's something that'll take time to get used to.    The result is a game that shows what the 360's hardware is capable of twelve months after release. It's not a quantum leap over the original, as the first game was already eye-wateringly tasty, but closer examination shows improvement in just about every area. And making this visual feast even better is the audio score.    It's only when music is damn good that it'll jump out and grab our attention, and that's something that rarely happens in shooters. GRAW2's music, however, did just that. From the melancholic swell of a choir through to the dark and moody electronic tracks, the music in GRAW2 is as varied as it is accomplished. It's accompanied by some great ambient and weapon sound effects, making this game truly worthy of some extra loud 5.1 love. Your neighbours will especially hate the roaring air strikes, but you'll love every bone-rattling second.    Once you've completed the single player game, the fun has only just begun - provided you've got a decent Internet connection and Xbox Live Gold membership. GRAW2 is second only to its stable mate Rainbow Six Vegas as the most feature-packed online product to grace Bill's private Internet.    With an eye in the sky, there's nowhere to hide.  Co-op will blow out your playtime by another three hours or so, provided you're not as crap at it as we are. It supports a whopping 16-players, and it appears the number of enemies is built around that. With only three players, our asses weren't so much handed to us on a platter as they were minced in an ass-grinder and then spoon fed to us. There was no lag with three players, but it'll be interesting to see how Aussie net connections handle 16 player co-op games. To be honest, based on the demands of co-op and the low average speed of an Aussie connection, we think a more realistic number would be a still-impressive figure of ten players. We'll happily post our results if we're proven wrong. Update - we were wrong. Our first IGN AU reader Live night proved that it runs great with 16-player co-op.   There are six rather massive co-op maps which fit around the main game's story, as well as several different co-op modes. While we've yet to play them, our US comrades rave about the helicopter mode, where you're tasked with teaching nasty gun-ships how to not fly, with the aid of rocket launchers.    The adversarial side of the game contains so many different modes that it's quite confusing. They're not even described in the manual, which isn't too helpful. However, we've played around with a few of them, and it's great to see some real innovation. As well as the expected CTF, sharpshooter and other modes, a few of the mission-based modes give your team AI helpers. We hosted a session with twelve real players, plus the AI helpers, and noticed zero lag. Nice work.     Practically every setting you can think of can be tweaked. Sick of players abusing the overly powerful grenade launchers? Click on disable launchers and voila. We even had one game where the host thought it would be a good idea to do a midnight map with no night-vision. Douche. Bag. Yet it was strangely fun, bumbling around in the dark, crickets chirping.   There's one major issue with the online experience though. In fact, it's the only issue. The connection metre is still naffed, as we whined about in our multiplayer preview  . The readout for each server is a blinking, flashing mess of green blocks - strangely it worked perfectly on the first night we had the game, probably due to fewer players. We beg Ubi to fix this feature, as it will make the game more playable for those in smaller regions. Thankfully our games with US players weren't too laggy, except when some bright spark thought his 256k connection would be fine to host 16 players.    But other than that small and very solvable complaint, GRAW2 online is like the single player game -  a very similar experience to the first game, but with an additional twelve months of love. Oh yeah, we forgot to mention the huge variety of maps, many of which have adjustable lighting. Or the time we shot an enemy, but only wounded him, leaving him gasping on the ground, waiting for a buddy to come revive him. And when his buddy did, we sniped them both. Awesome. Seriously, the online is deserving of its very own review. If youre expecting a totally new gaming experience, you should probably never buy a sequel again. Which means 98% of the games being released these days are out of bounds. But if you dug the first game, get ready for an even bigger, better and badder experience. GRAW2 is yet another bullet to the chest of competing shooters, proving that the Clancy stable are the ones to beat in this genre.", "date": "Mar 9, 2007"}
