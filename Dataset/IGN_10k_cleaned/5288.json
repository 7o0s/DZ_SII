{"name": "NHL 1999", "name_review": "NHL '99", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/28/nhl-99", "text": "OK, I'm not exactly a huge hockey fan (although I will catch an occasional game on TV - especially the Stanley Cup playoffs), but I've been a fan of the NHL Hockey series ever since I got my hands on the Genesis version over six years ago.  Even with its single camera angle, its 2D graphics and hokey fight sequences, the original NHL was enough to keep me and my friends in constant thumb agony.  So you can imagine my excitement when I got my hands on EA Sport's newest installment for the PC.     The first thing you'll notice is the gameplay improvements over NHL '98.  Players are much easier to control and gameplay is smooth and intuitive.  The new, harder glass-breaking checks are quite intense and satisfying as well.  EA has also added a shot meter so you can gauge the intensity of your shot before wacking it.  You can tap the button for a wrist shot or hold it down for a much more powerful slapshot.  Finally, the developers have added more realistic puck physics allowing for more accurate passing, shooting, and puck deflections.  Another improvement over last year's version is the Artificial Intelligence system.  The AI seems to be a lot better in NHL '99 with less offsides caused by computer-controlled players, better defense, and easier passing because the players actually seem to be in their respective positions rather than lagging as often happened in the original.  The goalies are better defensively and respond faster too.  It's even harder to make a shot by going behind the goal and shooting for the far corner after you round the net.  I was still able to pull it off occasionally, but not as much as in previous versions of the game.  You'll even get some goals called back for goalie interference.    The graphics have been revamped for NHL '99 and the amount of detail the graphic designers put into this one is really amazing.  Not only are the NHL players represented by name in NHL '99, they also have skins that actually look like the real players.  For instance, virtual Jaromir Jagr  actually looks like real-life Jaromir Jagr -- right down to his poor white trash short-in-the-front/long-in-the-back haircut.  Lookin' good Jaromir.    EA has paid special attention to detail and has recreated each NHL arena down to the in ice ads (like Wendy's, Bauer, and gratuitous www.nhlpa.com ads).  Before the game you are treated to a video fly-in featuring the city skyline and ending with a zoomed shot of the arena.  In Chicago, you can even make out the John Hancock building in the background, which I'm still convinced is used to communicate with aliens.  On the rink, the ice reflects all of the action and skates kick up a little ice spray when players come to a sudden stop or change direction.  EA motion captured actual NHL players and laid skins over the captures to recreate extremely realistic hockey moves.  They even enlisted the talents of professional stunt men for many of the checking and fight scenes.  Man, I would have liked to have been on the set when they filmed that day.   There are a few graphic anomalies like background polygons appearing over foreground polygons, hockey sticks poking through gloves, and the occasional epileptic seizure (some opposing players vibrate wildly when you score on them . . . maybe they're just pissed), but these minor flaws hardly take away from the finely crafted graphics in NHL.  The sound is where NHL '99 really shines and this is definitely a game that uses sound cues to the fullest.  The color commentary and the excellent play-by-play by Darryl Reaugh and Jim Hughston is back, but the audio footage has been completely revamped.  You hardly hear the same thing twice and the designers managed to splice the sound cues in perfectly to fit the action.  Good job guys.  It really is in the game.  NHL 99 features all 27 NHL teams, East and West Conference teams, USA and North American All-Star teams, and 18 International teams (including such obscure countries as Belarus and Kazakstan).  You can pick from five types of gameplay: exhibition (one time game), season (either 26 or 82 games followed by a playoff), playoff (best of 1, 3, 5, or 7 games), tournament (8, 12, or 16 teams involved in 1-4 round robin games), and shootout (you against the goalie).  NHL 99 also includes coaching drills as taught by Marc Crawford, coach of the Colorado Avalanche, so you newbies can learn the basics before being thrown into competition.  Plus, with its four difficulty settings (beginner, rookie, pro, and all-star), you can take on other NHL teams without having to worry about getting your teeth knocked out.  Of course, as in previous installments, you can opt to take control of all of the action or leave the coaching and line changes to the computer, making NHL '99 one versatile game.  NHL '99 utilizes the 97-98 season stats with updated 1998 player rosters, with every player in the NHL being modeled.  You have total control over the league and can trade players, pick from a pool of free agents, or even create totally new players to throw on the ice. This let me live out my dream of being a Right Wing for the Pittsburgh Penguins. When you create a player, you can set a variety of variables like name, league, position, and even birth date.  You can choose from a basic template (like Power Forward, Defensive Specialist, or Speester) or choose to allocate your skill points in a variety of areas such as aggressiveness, shot power, speed, and (my personal favorite) intensity.  Although there is no Internet play, you can link 2 computers via modem or up to 8 computers via a LAN.  If you have enough controllers, you can even play a full 6-on-6 game with each player controlling each position on the ice.  Very impressive.  I can't say enough good things about this game . . . but it's going to take a solid system to run properly.  Although the minimum requirements are a P166MHz system, it was basically unplayable on a P200MHz system with a Direct3D compatible video card.  It did rock on a P300MHz with a 3Dfx card though.  While not completely different from NHL '98, the newest version does improve on the tried-and-true engine and adds a few nice gameplay and graphical extras which make it one of the best sports games of this year and I can safely say that you can't go wrong with NHL '99.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 28, 1998"}
