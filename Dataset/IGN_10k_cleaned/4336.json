At the dirt-filled coliseum! Monster trucks! Monster trucks! Bigfoot is back and ready for revenge! And now all this action has been brought to the Playstation 2! Are you ready? Well then you better scream!   Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal is a heavy metal 4x4 bang-em-up with plenty of huge trucks, wheelies, broken axles, dirt jumps, and power-up arcade action. It's big, dumb, and a bit of fun. For a session of rampaging and bashing into other pickups on steroids, MoM brings a few moments of blissful chaos in an otherwise high-speed wreck of a game.   Gameplay  MoM features turbo charged monster trucks in races both legal and illegal. The legal races are in dirt coliseums with plenty of bumps to jump and  small cars to crunch during a one-on-one race. The illegal races are more freeform, racing in open areas against five other trucks through a series of checkpoints. Boosting all of the action is the regular turbo which can overheat the engine as well as power-ups that give more speed, traction, strength, or suspension.    Playing in the single-player mode takes a tour of the country, hitting all of these different races along with some exhibition matches in which the goal is to please the crowd by doing tricks, like crushing a series of cars or doing donuts and kicking up dirt.    These races started out as being fun, in a mindless truck-racing kind of way, but problems quickly crept in. The exhibition matches are required to make money to pay for the regular races, but they have quirky camera problems that make precise driving difficult and they don't even have a retry button. After messing up, I was forced to go through a menu and two load screens to try again.    On the regular races, it's easy to get the truck stuck in a hole or on top of an obstacle. Make a slight mistake and it'll turn into a ten or twenty second error that blows the whole race. I have to admit I didn't feel too disappointed because each legal race required nine laps on the same track to win, three laps for each of the three trucks in the different heats. As for the illegal races, they're made extremely difficult by a haphazard camera system that I'll explain later.   Even the trucks were given a slapdash treatment. In the truck listings, there is a description that includes the make/model of the truck as well as the engine and transmission names, but doesn't have any stats for them. Finding out what truck drives better is a matter of trial and error. With over twenty to choose from, this process is nearly impossible. Combined with an awkward race system, MoM doesn't give gamers much to work with.    Graphics  MoM has some of the silliest human character design for any game. The rookie character has a perpetual ~gee-whiz~ look on his face which is a bit odd to begin with, but his head is so narrow that it looks like he'd been squeezed in a vise. The rest of the characters didn't fare much better and all come out looking like caricatures of white trash cliches. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but it the effect is so bad it's hilarious.  There's even a character named Mom who's a waitress that also drives monster trucks.    The camera in MoM is the worst part about the game. There is only one forward camera view which is slightly behind the truck. I found this to be a huge problem in the illegal races because it's easy to run into small objects during a high-speed chase across a field or while smashing through fences and buildings. Even worse, the camera is slow to turn after the truck does which left me staring at the side of the truck all too often. The camera would get stuck at the entrances of tunnels and turning around buildings left me looking at a wall. It's surprising that MoM is being released with such a glaring problem.   Sound  Just like the characters, the voices are about as bad as they get. Announcers get about five different phrases and then don't even use them at the right time. Right after a big jump where my engine was as cool as it could be, the announcer yelled, ~whoa, he better watch his engine!~ When I was about to overheat, he'd just get excited about my jumps. It didn't make any sense. It's as if the sound was done in a few days and tacked on to the rest of the game.    The soundtrack is all heavy metal all the time. That pretty much means all power chords all the time and is a large chugging mass of noise really. I'm all for power chords and heavy metal, no really, but the soundtrack here sounds like the guitarist fell backwards into the drum kit and they both are tumbling down an infinitely long set of stairs. Not pretty.  If you're a really, really big fan of monster trucks, this game certainly features them and a lot of events that they're in. It also has a horrendous camera system, random trucks with no stats, terrible voice acting, badly designed courses, and characters that look so bad they're funny. If you're dead set on a monster truck, I would strongly recommend renting this for a few hours first.", "date": "Dec 16, 2003"}
