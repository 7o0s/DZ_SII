With Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, you get to punt around all sorts of undead, orcish, and other fantastical foes into fires, off cliffs, and into spikes creating a definite ~wow~ factor associated with exploring the various ways to dispatch your enemies. While the single player mode can be entertaining, it starts to drag as it goes on. Thankfully there's an enjoyable multiplayer mode to keep things interesting, even if there are some class balancing issues. Regardless of which mode you're playing there seem to be significant technical problems that hold this game back from being as entertaining as it may initially promise.   The single player places you in the shoes of Sareth, disciple of a mage named Phenrig with an uncertain past. After an initial training sequence you're tasked with finding a magical artifact, the Skull of Shadows. You soon meet up with Leanna, a female love interest who you'll run some missions with. Another more flirtatious female character is joined to your thoughts, and frequently chirps up to either hit on you, make fun of Leanna, or offer advice for what to do next. Though the plot manages to get interesting near the middle, the beginning and end are narrative bores. There are a few endings, but they're unsatisfactory as best. You're playing this game for its action, not its storytelling.    In terms of action, Dark Messiah offers plenty along with a role-playing statistic boosting system in the game. By completing objectives you receive skill points that can be spend on upgrading melee attacks, learning new magical spells, or upgrading your stealth abilities. Shields, armor, swords, staves, daggers, and bows can be picked up as you move through the mostly linear 12-15 hour campaign. Upgrading melee gives you new attacks like a charge or jump, though the first person perspective makes these difficult to connect with them at times. Eventually you start getting magical items like fire bows and poison daggers which deal out additional damage. Since there aren't any vendors in the game, it's only worth holding on to the items you're actually going to use.   To slaughter enemies more effectively, you'll want to use the game's ~physics~ fighting abilities. These include a kick, the ability to topple some environmental structures onto foes, and knocking enemies into fires. Spiked grates populate every single level of the game and will instantly kill an enemy that gets kicked into them. Knocking an enemy into water will also auto-kill as will kicking them into a fire and booting them from a ledge. Should you choose to learn the Telekinesis spell, you can toss barrels, boxes, and bodies into enemies. When you pick items up with either your hands or the spell, they can be set aflame by holding them over one of the game's many fires. Running around with an ignited item will instantly kill anyone you run into.    While it's impressive to see enemies flipping off cliffs, floating in water, staggering realistically after a kick, and watching environments crumble and topple in a believable fashion, it renders some of the melee and ranged combat irrelevant. Since most of the game's single player arenas are set up with various spikes and fires for you to take advantage of, kicking enemies to their death will serve as a common method of execution as long as your stamina bar lasts. Once you get a little way through the game the gameplay starts to drag. Even if using the melee and magical abilities, the fights start to get repetitive after halfway through. The game still offers some interesting battle scenarios and it's definitely fun for a while, it just doesn't last.   Though there are a number of different ways to attack your foes, the fighting just doesn't feel as natural as it could have been. Some options for counter attacks would have been welcome, or some kind of combo system with the power strikes. As for the stealth gameplay, you can shoot bows from shadows and remain unnoticed (assuming you hit the target) or sneak up for a backstab kill. Sneaking turns out to be pretty difficult, far more so than sitting back and piercing an enemy's face with an arrow. With a game so heavily focused on combat, it seems like there should have been a few more advanced options for sneaking as well. For instance, what about cutting an enemy's Achilles' tendon? Afterwards the enemy could yell for help, drawing more foes ripe for stealth attacks to the area. As it is the enemies do alert others nearby if they're attacked and will occasionally run away if they think they're outmatched, but it seems like there was potential for many more levels of combat nuance.     To try and spice things up the game pits you against a few giant boss encounters and drops in some light puzzle elements. The four Cyclopes that appear throughout the game are fun to fight. They'll kick objects at you, slam the ground, and even pick you up and toss you across the room. Encounters with these guys are definitely the best of the boss fights, especially the underwhelming final battle. The Pao-Kai dragons, which are beautifully drawn and animated, can be toppled in seconds using the environment. This was rather disappointing given how impressive they look. At one point you run into a giant worm. Though you don't fight it, avoiding its deadly strikes and poison blasts proves to be engaging.   You'll find a rope bow early on in the game, which serves as the solution to the game's light puzzle elements. Firing one of its unlimited arrows into any wooden structure spawns a rope which you can then use to ascend to higher levels. It's generally obvious when and how to use this, but it at least adds some variety to the gameplay.  Overall the single player campaign has a few neat tricks that are enjoyable for a few hours, but once you're used to the mechanics it offers too little that's new to keep fights interesting. You'll get better weapons and spells that have different effects, but oftentimes these will wind up making the fights even simpler. The lighting shield comes to mind, which paralyzes a foe with electricity whenever it's used to block. After knocking the enemy down, you can perform a fatality instant kill by using a power move while they're still on the ground. After enough successful melee hits adrenaline attacks become available, which turns your power moves into yet another opportunity for an instant kill.    We wound up having a lot more fun with the game's multiplayer. All the auto-kill physics are removed online, forcing players to concentrate more on their skills than environmental positioning. Either Undead or Human races can be chosen, and thereafter Warrior, Mage, Assassin, Priest, and Archer classes. The game offers Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Crusade modes can be played on a range of five maps. Though not all the maps are very good (Nar-Heresh is particularly annoying to play on) the class advantages and strategies are interesting. Like in the single player, you get points to learn new abilities. Unlike the single player, you earn points by making kills and using your abilities. Being rewarded for killing the opposition instead of completing stage objectives makes the combat much more satisfying.   Learning to combine each class' varying abilities can lead to some surprisingly deep combat. The priest, for instance, has a number of healing abilities yet remains effective at fighting. After gaining a few levels over the course of an online match you can learn stoneskin for extra protection and brambles to slow the movement of attackers. The brambles function to augment the power of your corrupt spell, a channeled damage attack. If an enemy gets too close, you can trigger stoneskin and switch over to a staff for a few melee hits to take them down for good. Archers have some useful abilities as well, including flame arrows that do damage over time and the ability to shoot two or three arrows at a time. At close range, the multiple arrows act like a shotgun blast, decimating whatever's on the receiving end. Assassins can cloak, and also have a useful ability to disguise themselves as member of the other team. While playing we managed to use both of these abilities to effectively sneak close enough to perform a backstab attack and take out our target.    The Crusade mode takes place over a sequence of maps and players maintain their character statistics throughout. On each map players will need to capture and hold flag points to decrease the opposing team's score to zero, like in Battlefield. Here player roles change, as Mages and Priests can set up defensive perimeters with magic shields, poison clouds, and brambles. Working together as a team to assault points really makes a difference, especially if everyone is using the proper abilities. Some of the skills seem overpowered, however. A Warrior's charge will wipe out anyone in his way, and a Mage's fireball attack is particularly deadly. It does plenty of area of effect damage and can even be guided by the player after it's launched. Still, we wound up having a lot more fun online than off. With up to 32 players in a server, the fights can get pretty intense. While participating in a Crusade, it's also possible to switch between classes while maintaining your level progress in the one switched away from. This allows you to switch your class depending on the needs of the team without losing progress already made.     Dark Messiah is definitely a pretty game. During your adventures you'll come across highly detailed character models, eye-catching spell effects, and excellent HDR lighting. Sprawling outdoor vistas, particularly the cliffs at the Temple of the Spider, look especially impressive. Underneath the sheen of lighting effects are some lower resolution textures on some environments and weapons. One great visual strength of Dark Messiah is how it handles your character's perspective. If you look down, you see your body. You can turn your head independently of your arms, and you can turn on a head bob that adds realism to the otherwise goofy running animation. The effect of this is to draw you further into the experience and make it seem like you're playing as an actual person as opposed to a floating weapon. The game's sounds are mostly average. Voice acting ranges from listenable to cheesy. There's some decent music though the sound effects for weapon classes and spells are crisp.    Finally and unfortunately, Dark Messiah suffers from technical issues. We installed it on a number of systems and experienced frequent crashes to desktop in both the single and multiplayer games. It seemed to mostly happen on loading screens, especially when we hit the ~reload from last save~ button in the single player. Though there's an auto-save system in place that prevents you from losing too much progress offline, crashes while playing a Crusade online can be extremely frustrating. If you built up a character to level seven and finally learned the Archer's triple arrow attack or some other high level ability, it's all lost with a crash. Loading multiplayer matches can also be a chore, as we were left hanging on the load screen on several occasions. There were also a number of bugs in the single player campaign, such as items disappearing from our inventory and scrolls turning into unlimited-use spells.With its single player mode, Dark Messiah offers up plenty of action that eventually wears thin. It's still entertaining to kick around enemies and toss around parts of the environment though. There's a nice range of items to be found, all of which have an attractive appearance and occasionally an eye-catching glow. Some of the environmental textures are noticeably low resolution, but the excellent lighting effects help please your eye's unquenchable desire for beauty. The multiplayer is the better half of the game, letting players battle it out with five diverse classes and plenty of interlocking and complementary abilities. Though the first-person combat isn't as precise as it could be, this one's still a good choice for some online magic blasting fun. Just don't expect a memorable story or characters if you're more interested in the single player content.", "date": "Oct 28, 2006"}
