So, a bunch of unnamed countries all band together to form the Global Assault Team, comprised of you. Don't worry! Even though you're alone, you're more powerful than the United States, British, Russian, or Chinese militaries. The Syndicate will be defeated in approximately one day, assuming you have the patience and the system to play through the tactical first-person shooter that is New World Order, of course.   Singleplayer New World Order is a huge copout. Few configurable options aside from three difficulty settings that range from ~Kind of frustrating~ to ~Unfair~ to ~Why the hell am I even playing this?~ are provided for. The rest of the solo game is a dozen or so vast and poorly constructed maps sparsely populated with enemy AI. Later levels are loaded with baddies who sport x-ray vision, the spidey-sense, and even Hawk Eye's pinpoint aim, so don't spit on the unpopulated start, because you'll soon be praying for its return. See, the AI forces you to hate it. You'll hate it for all of the supernatural powers it possess that you do not. But after playing considerably, you'll realize that the gamma ray endowments are necessities, for without them the AI would just waste its time falling off rafters, spinning around in circles, crouch walking right up to you and then jogging in place, assuming it's not shooting the hell out of any and all of its comrades that happen to be nearby. So get used to the supernatural.  It wouldn't be so bad if they couldn't see and shoot through walls. Thankfully, if you're cool with walking everywhere and using only suppressed weapons sparingly, it is possible to capitalize off of their totally random and ill thought out placement within the maps. Terrorists are often found facing corners, guarding a wall with their backs to the police line, or just obliviously standing about. Walk up slowly and toss a slug into a fool's dense cranium and you'll find New World Order suddenly becoming a hell of a lot easier. Easy isn't exciting. This game is tedious.  This isn't Raven Shield where a few of lunatics like you, me and a buddy can toss 30 enemies in a map on Elite and go nuts in a seriously hardcore kind of way for three hours. The more you try and make New World Order get better and be fun, the worse it will be. More bad guys means more choppiness and more AI frustration. More teammates in cooperative mode means virtual unplayability when there's anything on screen that's more system taxing than a wall. So take on the AI like the lone wolf you are. Solo, The Punisher and Bigshot (he's a recovering alcoholic trying to keep his all consuming rage under control) wouldn't have it any other way.  Convoluted, perfunctory and utterly worthless, singleplayer is an inane text-based storyline that forwards along household chores. Saving hostages and disarming bombs all amounts to killing every living thing in each environment, so don't bother reading or obeying any rules and just go ahead and systematically sweep the enormous, maze-like levels and pretend you're a mom pushing the vacuum cleaner around the house. Everything will be fine if you don't leave anyone alive, unless aimlessly backtracking in search of the last terrorist who will just be admiring a truck is something that's of great importance to you. Don't believe me? Just play the first level. After dying twelve times you'll get used to the blaring, perfectly consistent alarm that even sounds off in the menu system. Having fun? WAAA --- WAAA --- WAAA --- WAAA. Yeah, go ahead and tinker with the volume levels, I dare you.  Heralded as the end all say all king of the tactical shooter market, the entire point of playing New World Order is to whoop some overly skilled ten-year-old's ass online in heated battles, not to dick around with lowly AI a sleeping ape could outclass. You can sometimes (kind of sort of) get that first ~online~ bit to work. But the whole ~playing against others and in heated battles~ thing isn't ever going to happen, ever.   Each time I started up multiplayer I was confronted with between ten and twenty servers. That's it. Literally, every single time I played, I saw only three servers that were even remotely populated. The rest displayed lovely 0s. I'd crash out of one constantly, be subjected to boring as all hell three-way fights on another, and wouldn't even be allowed into the third because it was for NWO testers or some special clan or some idiot that password protected his Pentium 166 server that no one would join anyway. Where is all of that in-depth extended server information? Probably lost in the black hole of oblivion that devoured the last few shreds of enjoyment New World Order had going for it.  It's the same maps as singleplayer and the same modes we've been enjoying since Counter-Strike, so don't expect anything new from this online or LAN play. Honestly, I took it as somewhat of a learning experience. Way I figure it, all we have to do is send law enforcement down to subways, warehouses, ports, and drug money bought mansions and this whole terrorist problem will be solved.   Environments are acceptably designed, but even on medium detail settings, my 2GHz, Radeon 9700, 768MB RAM machine runs sloppily. Strangely, on my system (others didn't fair so well) I had comparable performance at higher settings. It seemed flipping everything on or off made little to no difference. Imagine seeing a naked mechanic -- the stereotypical kind, all fat and unsightly. Wrap him up with a see-through, thinner than paper lace material. Is it any better? Can he sit on your couch?  I recommend immediately axing the higher-end audio options, they seem to help a little (emphasize that word little with a shout and a pom-pom, please). But don't worry too much, certain gun effects, impacts and ricochets are still awesome even while toned down, but then all the other crap gets worse (music is nonexistent).   ~Kill him!~  Dude, you know you're talking to yourself?      Back to business, Devastation outperforms and outshines these levels in about a billion different ways. Likewise, titles like Unreal II and Black Hawk Down make NWO feel detached -- a house of cards made of polygons. They do boast hip bump-mapping and stylish lighting, but it's nothing that will put Halo to shame, nor is the tradeoff in system performance worth what little benefit there appears to be.   Weapon models are decent, but not nearly the detailed wonders we've seen in Raven Shield and Double Helix or even forthcoming titles like Oblivion Llost. Likewise, character models exhibit bizarre, stiff motions and die without the glory of ragdolls, which I don't take as much offense to here because death falls are fast, fairly neat, and make little thuds. But that doesn't mean sound isn't the biggest hit and miss bag I've ever seen in my entire life. Weapon effects range from totally awesome to just wrong, while ricochets, impacts, and the falling of drywall spackle are truly cool. Then, to ruin it all, a lot of the maps come with annoying ambient sounds, like a truck humming or my beloved alarm blaring or something else that's just as horrible.  And if you'll notice, I haven't even touched on control yet.  This is where New World Order arguably fails and falls hardest (I say arguably because not being able to happily and consistently play online is also pretty bad).   NWO does nothing of interest or value. What it does do, it does wrong. Even moving is clumsy. Like an ostrich, characters bound around bobbing their head and arms while flailing their legs insanely (turn that off as soon as you can). Climb that ladder and watch me laugh at you. Make sure to keep that mouse pointed dead center straight ahead otherwise you'll be scurrying off to the side and crammed between the ladder and the wall, unable to free yourself without letting go completely. How about rocks? Think you can walk up rocks or around a plant or up a narrow flight of stairs? It's like hooks on chains drag from every one of your appendages. It's just not possible to avoid getting caught on every bleeding thing that isn't flat and a ceiling.   Since it miserably fails to get the walking part down, New World Order tries to add a little innovation to spice up play. A momentum system has been suspiciously included in certain places so you'll sometimes find yourself jumping and sliding down an incline. Not so neat. If you try jumping onto that raised platform, pray to God you're in exactly the right place you need to be, else you'll be jumping six more times.  Want to lean? Sorry. Want to go prone? Sorry. Want to pick up health and armor? Sorry. What to pick locks, open doors, slide down ladders, roll while prone, use smoke grenades, hack terminals, bust out the flashlight and thermal vision, breach doors, tip tables with physics...? Sorry!  It's a huge leap backward for the genre as a whole. It's not enough that New World Order refuses to offer anything new, it actually manages to take away functionality. Use the inventory, but keep that instruction manual on-hand in case the names of the guns aren't yet memorized. Earn yourself some experience and whatnot and do your thing. Everything is based on grams, as in the thousands, so when it comes time to equip at totally random spots throughout the maps, make sure you understand simple math.   Picking up and dropping stuff is pretty standard, but it does require crouching ridiculously close to an object and selecting what you see, which requires being in very close proximity to imminent death. Also, perhaps it's just me, but I found myself incapable of taking the ammo from a weapon without taking a weapon, which means if I wanted more shotgun love I'd have to drop what I had and hope what I'd get would be better.   The weight system needs to be axed in favor of a slotted system, because the whole damn thing is in the thousands of grams and even though numbers tell the mathematically challenged what's what, on the fly drops and grabs can be a pain if you're a few grams short of your capacity and really need that assault rifle. Well, maybe you can ask a kid on your team for help while you're looting a corpse, right?   Strangely enough, when you issue commands or speak by bringing up the prompt and then selecting a number key for your response, it will also bring up the weapon bound to that number key, so get ready to switch your guns if you're planning on ever saying anything.  To its credit, there are a ton of weapons. Yeah, they're what you think they'll be: shotguns, pistols, rifles, machineguns, whatever. Possibly to its credit (I am seriously baffled by this next part), New World Order may or may not include a shoot through walls ballistics model similar in principle to Global Operations.   I honestly can't tell if the ballistics model here is intentional, or some kind of bug that appears on certain levels. I know you'll see impact and exit holes (or just lumps) for materials, but whether or not someone can be hit seems to be either completely random or determined by material, luck, and the map played. This is no Global Ops. It's far less useful in practical situations. If I am exploiting a bug, apologies to those four people I played with online. Either way, it makes little difference. America's Army was free and forced gamers to play fair under penalty of corporal punishment. Global Ops had a superb ballistics system. Counter-Strike is about balance and familiarity. Battlefield offers scope, immersion, vehicles and an epic feel. Quake and UT are all about reflexes and mods... So right now, ask yourself this: in light of so many other grander, superior titles that excel in so many other ways, why should I invest in New World Order? Is it the sloppy performance? The limited options? The uncertain future? The horrible bots? The deficient ladder-esque singleplayer ~campaign?~ The Uninspired level design? All that nonfunctional netcode? An already dying community...? Why? Do you know?Not only does New World Order not innovate or propel the genre anywhere new by offering anything new, it in fact counteracts the achievements of others by taking away the basics they used to deliver the quality they represent. I'd really, really like to move without getting caught on every damn thing in sight.This game is so broken it's almost insulting.", "date": "Apr 4, 2003"}
