The game was an ambitious conversion from 3D console title to Game Boy Color game, but it royally sucked because of technical issues and, well, it was Grand Theft Auto. I haven't quite figured out why they made a sequel, but Take 2 went right back to the same team for Grand Theft Auto 2. The next game in the series has been cleaned up from the last version, but it's still an irritating game with boring gameplay and obnoxiously clunky controls. It's an improvement on a technical level, but as a game Grand Theft Auto 2 still royally sucks.  Features Non-linear gameplay Five different gangs to choose Password save Only for Game Boy Color  In this sequel you play out the role of a gang member in a turf war between other gangs. You'll have to patrol the streets on foot and in vehicles, waiting for jobs to open. Finish the tasks and open up other jobs to get further into the game. Oh, and you'll have to be conservative as well as aggressive -- speed in job completion is key, but so is staying alive. You only have five lives to live, and if you crash a car or get shot too much, one of those tries flies out the window. Luckily after each job you get a password which will get you further into the game after you turn off the system.  But all this doesn't matter -- the game is dreadfully dull and an absolute chore to play. I honestly can't figure out why a sequel was commissioned when the first game was so darn repetitive. On the PlayStation, sure...they could take the game further with cooler graphic effects, harder music, bigger and more elaborate missions. But even the console version didn't add much more to the mix that the original created. On the Game Boy, all that's been upgraded is the game engine -- the original game lacked the traffic necessary for the one true gameplay element: carjacking. See, that's the real hook of GTA -- the ability to walk up to any vehicle and take it for a spin. And that element's back in the sequel, though it's been simplified in this game by offering no animation or transition from outside to inside a vehicle. The game engine offers a lot of traffic this time around, but at a cost -- the game has a lot of slowdown in places all over the city.  Missions range from grabbing items from one area and delivering them to other parts of the map, to...well, that's pretty much all that the game offers. Some games do this type of gameplay correctly (Driver, for example), but in GTA2's case, all the jobs in the game really feel like tasks you just don't want to do.   To its credit, the game drives a little better than the original, but that's honestly not saying much. Though the controls have been tightened up, the driving interface is still horribly implemented -- cars will have tighter turns going faster than slower, which makes it an absolute pain to get free of being lodged against buildings and stuck between tiny pedestrians. You'll find yourself more struggling to drive than actually driving, and what fun is a game when you have to fight the controls? And when you're on foot it's tough to aim your guns at opponents because of the tiny graphics...but this isn't as obnoxious as getting behind the wheel and getting stuck in traffic.I appreciate the desire to try and move games from the higher platforms to the Game Boy Color, but geez, Grand Theft Auto 2? The first one was bad enough. I will take this time to plead with Rockstar Games -- just say No to GTA on GBA. The game isn't that good in design to bother bringing to the handheld -- let alone the limitation problems. This is it...no more GTA. Please.", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
