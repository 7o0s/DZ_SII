What made this game stand out from the usual video bowling fare was its focus on the physics of the sport. No developer had or has come close to the ball spin and the pin action of Ten Pin Alley.  Well, the team went on, and this year created another version of the parlor sport. This time, however, it went one step further in realism. Where Ten Pin Alley was a comical, yet realistic, take on bowling, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is an all-out simulation of the sport.  Like Ten Pin Alley, control is as simple as lining up your bowler and the aim of the ball, and setting the amount of spin. Then it's all a matter of timing button presses to the speed and accuracy of the throw, much like a golf simulator. THQ recruited the help of Mike Aulby, Chris Barnes, Johnny Petraglia, and more (if you follow the circuit, you'd know who these guys are) to make this game as authentic as possible. Create your character and take him through a career against all the pros. There's even a section where you can hear these guys talk about their career and game styles. And Brunswick is six-player with or without the Multitap.  As if it really needed it, the physics engine has been tweaked further. Different alleys have different oil patterns, and throughout a game the oil will evaporate making it harder to keep your strikes in a rhythm. What's more, in this game you can even do a frame-by-frame replay of the last frame.   There's also a few other little options, like Cosmic Bowl where everything has a blacklight look to it. You can even enter practice mode and learn how to pick up every conceivable spare. Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowl is the complete bowling game.Let me start off this review by tooting my own horn. I'm a bowler -- or used to be, rather. At last count, I had a 175 sanctioned average, which isn't too shabby -- I know the sport well.That said, Brunswick Pro Bowling is the equivalent of the best golf simulation on the market. It's the finest bowling game out there, and anyone can pick this game up and get some enjoyment out it. It's best if you have an appreciation for the sport, but it makes for a great party game, too.The camera flows as if it were ABC covering Saturday Afternoon PBA. Thanks to a very smooth 3D engine, the camera can follow the ball at designated angle along the lanes, even looking straight down at the pins. Very dramatic.The physics are unbelievable. The ball and the pins react exactly as they should. Even better, you can step through every single strike, spare, and miss to see what went right/wrong in the instant replay mode. Very cool. And it's fair to beginners as well, since you can see the predicted trajectory before you release the ball  a feature that can (and should) be turned off for those who have practiced up in the game.My only real complaint is the lack of a practice session before a tournament. You're going into an unfamiliar alley, and it's common to be able to take a few rolls to get a feel for the lanes. Other than that, this is a prime bowling simulator  it appeals to me since I know the sport well, but for those who could care less about bowling, there ain't nothin' here that'll make you like the game any better.", "date": "Oct 3, 1998"}
