Where a game like Tetrisphere tried to shove Tetris into the future with a whole new 3D look and style of gameplay, TNT stays loyal to the original concept of the game while adding enough new features to freshen it up for all of us who wore out the NES, SNES and even laptop versions of Pajitnov's platinum hit. N64 owners should consider themselves lucky since they have the most well executed update to the original Tetris game on perhaps any console.  Gameplay For 1999, The New Tetris is going to rely on a wonderful multiplayer mode, a handful of clever new features and top notch sound elements to carry it through the fall season.  Tetris 64, from Seta, was the first Tetris game on the N64 to feature a four player mode -- but it never made it to the US (you can check out our review of the game by clicking here. The New Tetris borrows the all important ~garbage~ feature in simplified form from that Japanese import game, that will have gaming buddies cursing each other all the live long day. With as many as four players stacking bricks on the same screen in four separate playing cells, you can send piles of incomplete lines to either a buddy of your choosing or let the computer select your victim in ~Hot Potato~ mode. Of course, delivering garbage isn't as easy as pressing a button. When you clear four lines at once, commonly known as ~a tetris,~ a few seconds later a collection of four lines with one brick missing from each will pile up at the bottom of your friend's cell underneath whatever structures he or she already has going. Garbage delivered. The computer A.I. also rewards you for particularly clever moves when you only clear two or three lines at once, and will send maybe one or two lines of garbage to your neighbor. There's also one more killer way to send garbage to your opponents that we'll get to later, and, trust us, this is the one that will have them cursing you the most.   Our favorite new feature is unique to the N64 only and just may set the standard for all Tetris games to come. The swap feature will allow players to switch whatever current piece they have control of with a ~hold~ piece that's shown in the corner of the screen. When you make the switch, the piece you had becomes the hold piece and will stay there until you use it or the game ends. You can't just get rid of it forever. The trick is you can only switch once per new piece. So, for example, if you wanted to switch out your current four square block and bring in that handy little ~t~ piece, it should be no problem, but you can't change your mind and switch back to the block. You've got to put that ~t~ down somewhere before you can get a new piece and the process starts over. While at first glance, this would seem to make the game so much easier since you can simply swap a piece you don't like, it actually adds another level of strategy to The New Tetris that really gets you into the game.  Sharp players will quickly realize the strategy of swapping out those lovely straight pieces when they come up and holding onto them until they're really needed. All Tetris players know how rare those straight bricks become once we've set up the perfect tetris ~slot~ for them. While the block generating A.I. is supposedly randomized according to skill level, most of us at IGN64 are convinced that saving straight bricks leads to a steady stream of the most rag tag assortment of bricks the computer can think up. That good old tetris slot will definitely be hard to earn.  The other feature that adds a new twist to TNT is square building. It's a tough challenge but it's worth it, especially in the multiplayer game. You have to somehow twist, flip and slide your pieces into a finite, four unit by four unit square on the game screen. The most obvious way to do this is with four of those 2x2 square blocks stacked into a big 4x4 square. When you do this, the square will change color and solidify into one massive brick sitting there in the middle of your structure. The third picture on the right of this page shows a good shot of it. If you use four of the same pieces to make your square (it can also be done with the Ts, Ls and straight pieces), the giant square will turn gold. If you use a mix of bricks to make your square, it'll turn silver. Now, when you clear lines that are connected to the big square, you'll get bonus lines added to your score or extra lines will be shipped off to your garbage collecting buddies. Gold squares yield more bonus lines than silver ones, but both are simply devastating when it comes to multiplayer games. We're talking about piles of unusable crap stacked six or seven units high. If you catch someone in a difficult moment, sending a tetris to them that includes a gold brick could instantly put them out of their misery.  Graphics The New Tetris offers bonus backgrounds and songs for players to unlock all with a ~wonders of the world~ theme to them. You can stack bricks in Greece, complete with pristine white pillars and gold armor to set the mood. Aztec temples have burning torches and native pottery to keep you in the building mood. There's some kind of animation in each background whether it's flickering flame or drifting clouds. With the inevitable hectic pace to the game, though, you may never get to appreciate these well done backgrounds. However, clearing a set number of lines will unlock a famous monument, which is rendered in full 3D. A camera fly-by shows you the buildings from all angles. It's nice, but the framerate gets a bit choppy.  The game bricks themselves are sprite based and aren't much more to look at then their older cousins. There are little lighting effects and rounded edges to give them 3D feel if that's important to you. Likewise, framerate really isn't issues with this one. Speed can be an enemy in this one and when things got hectic, we didn't observe any slowdown or choppiness in those bricks as they rained down on us.  Sound After his much lauded techno tracks in Tetrisphere, it's no surprise H2O  once again brought in Neil D. Voss to compose and arrange the music for its  latest puzzle game. With most N64 developers still cranking out  low-fidelity audio that streams off the cartridge in mono, audiophiles  who've been patiently waiting to once again crank up the volume on their  stereos will find The New Tetris was well worth the wait.    Voss once again opted to go for high quality (sequenced) techno music --  but this time, the selection of tracks fits the game's ~Seven World  Wonders~ presentation. The full-stereo tunes come alive with a mixture of  techno beats, plenty of sampled chants and a wide array of ethnic  instruments, ranging from Sitar to Gamelan. Whether you're into the  Propellerheads-like track ~Floppy~ or the India-meets-Egypt style of  ~Pyramid~, your subwoofer will be busy pumping out the music's heavy bass  lines like there's no tomorrow. Tetris-fans will also love the intro song  (inspired by the franchise's trademark melody) which accompanies the game's  innovative ~building the logo~ sequence and is later echoed in the more  relaxing ~DVIE~ track. Like with Tetrisphere, Voss again knocks some of the  samples out of phase to produce a 3D effect, making it sound like some of  the audio comes from behind you.    Compared with the game's music, sound effects are subdued and basic, with  no-frills clanks and crumbling noises. Still, every sound in the game is  clean and perfectly sampled, making The New Tetris perhaps the  best-sounding Nintendo 64 game yet.  Peripheral Support We wish other games could imitate TNT's memory pak usage. Since all of the game's secrets are unlocked by collecting total lines, every game you play counts towards your total once you create a game for yourself on the game pak. This includes multiplayer battles and the different single player modes. Unlocking the series of new backgrounds and music usually requires thousands of lines to be cleared. When you get going with your friends in a serious smack talking multiplayer session you can  knock off 500 or so line without thinking about it. But what happens when your friend takes his game home or you have to return you rental copy with all of your saved game data on it? No problem. You just stick the info onto a memory pak and you can then take that and load it onto another game pak that will then keep track of it for you. This ensures that everytime you play The New Tetris, whether it's on your copy of the game or someone else's, you will always get credit for the lines you clear, no matter what. This will keep you moving toward all of those new structures and songs at a nice pace. I can remember the days of watching and waiting for people while they played Tetris on the NES by themselves. Now, not only can I jump in and banish them with my superior skill, but I can do it in a variety of ways. This is what makes the New Tetris so fun and exciting. There are definitely some new strategies to be discovered what with the new gameplay features and multiplayer mode. This game gets the nod over an import like Tetris 64 because it does everything that it's trying to do without flaw. How many games can make that claim? Granted it's not trying to do much beyond what the original Tetris intended, but this game could have easily been a lazily executed rehash wrapped up in a new box.While the basic premise of clearing lines remains the same, I especially like the brick swapping feature and mastering this will be the key to success for all potential Tetris masters. The most underrated feature in TNT, the one found in all true Tetris games, is that there's no cheating way to plan your next move since the bricks will vanish when you pause the game. You better not mind doing it the hard way.", "date": "Aug 4, 1999"}
