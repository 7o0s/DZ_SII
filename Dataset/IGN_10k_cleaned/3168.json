The heavy, war flavored music beats to quick paragraphs about wars of succession and the history of the mercenary. Then, from out of the blue, a really horrible video of in-game action kicks in. What the hell? Full MechWarrior games are traditionally preceded by amazing CG and lots of shooting. And, low and behold, I do recall installing this, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries.   A big chunk of an impoverished city exploded in MechWarrior 3. We saw how futile the machinegun was in the hands of the experienced in MechWarrior 2. A Kodiak proved its power in Ghost Bear's Legacy. And, a bizarrely out of place live actor nobly piloted his 'Mech in the defense of the royalty in Vengeance. Such pleasures are not the case here, where we get clips of poorly compressed in-game action and a bit of background for Mercenaries. Forsaking tradition makes me weep, but from sadness was born bliss once I picked my sponsor (Kell Hounds, naturally) and began decimating any and all comers within the Inner Sphere.   Let there be no confusion about it, this is not the riot inducing insanity we're all hoping and expecting MechWarrior 5 will be. No, Mercenaries is rather a refined, retooled, and rethought Vengeance that finally revisits the premise that powered the much heralded MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries. Hire a team, throw them all headlong into walking instruments of mass destruction, take any job that comes your way, and kill everything that stands. That, my free-birth friends, is why it's so cool. By marrying the lifestyle and economics behind the hired gun with the meanest and leanest parts of BattleTech revisited on the PC, Mercenaries manages to be a game that duplicates all that was attractive about Vengeance, only it's now better, deeper, more engaging, and more lasting.  This game grabs. This story cuddles... And mankind is once again at war.   News briefs, debriefs, mission scenarios, in-game conversations, and in-game cutscenes all help deliver a classic MechWarrior story. Zipper all but mastered what a mission briefing should be with MechWarrior 3. Behind enemy lines, fueled by the need to finally end a bitter enemy's existence, and relying on the video clips of a spy drone was awesome, but since this game is part of Vengeance's family tree, it more follows that title's general approach to storytelling, only this time far more is at stake than a simple pass/fail scenario. Thus, more information is provided and more needs to be pondered over.   The main, underlying, fundamental difference between this game and Vengeance is that Mercenaries revolves around money. Money drives missions. Money drives motivation. Money in human form drives 'Mechs. Because moving through one mission after another and all the while buying things would be tedious and straightforward, Cyberlore and FASA opted to create a big chunk of the Inner Sphere and then drop players in the middle of it, granting them the precious freedom of choice. It's not a complete galaxy ripe with adventure, beckoning to be explored and pillaged, but it is a substantial leap over traditional branching or entirely linear structures.   Unfortunately, only a small cross-section of the ten total planets is available at the game's onset. In a way this keeps progression on track and prevents players from ever becoming too overwhelmed by their surroundings. In another, less attractive way, it thwarts whatever exploratory aspect the game could have had. Taking on the missions is indeed like taking on a group of missions from any other title of the sort all at once so that another group of missions can be unlocked, and there is, sadly, no branching conversational component to Mercs (oh, how I'd love to talk and threat seedy cliental like I would in Star Control II or Bladur's Gate), but that doesn't mean this design is without its charms.   Hooking up with sponsors is but the beginning. Their affect on gameplay is minimal, provided you're skilled enough to carry your own (extra bits of clan technology won't help the man who's already perfect). But, allegiance is the first step toward enjoyment. Jumping from planet to planet is the next, and biggest. It further develops a pervasive sense of immersion Mercs manages to carry with it from start to finish.  Since it's not necessary to move through each and every mission in a certain place before tackling each and every mission in another place, the game frees itself from frustrating stagnation and the forced repetition normally associated with other mission-based structures. Not having to continually retry that one boring or incredibly difficult scenario is almost as nice as not having to constantly play in the snow until you have to constantly play in the desert before constantly playing in the city. Mixing it up adds variety. Variety adds lasting interest.   Flying from planet to planet and shooting things would only be fun for so long, so Mercenaries adds another layer of depth to the equation: management. Since picking a planet requires time, which requires money, it's important to know what you're getting into and more important to weigh the consequences of your journey against the benefits. The planetary rundown states that there might be some heavy resistance... Is outfitting under experienced pilots purchased in the free market with pricey 'Mechs a financially justifiable decision? Is spending money on gas smart when the gas is powering the ship that's taking you straight to your death? Assessing the current status of your Mercenary unit and determining which missions to undertake in which order depending on your skill level and that of your team is crucial to becoming profitable, which is itself crucial to the life of a mercenary.   Not only do payments, purchases, repairs, and salvage all come into play, but the way in which a mission is completed affects the way in which subsequent contracts will be handled. Anyone one of these features is swell, but not great on its own. When they're all combined and then fed to players with extra helpings of sugary news briefs that expand the universe, they become a single, unifying reason to play. It's the combat and allure of Vengeance with the extra layer of imperfect but tasty frosting that keeps kids coming back for more.       Missions to be beaten do remain largely and fairly standard (kill someone, protect someone, blow the hell out of something), and the environments, including the new tropical settings, are all ho-hum, experienced, and actually looking quite dated by today's standards, especially in light of titles like Steel Battalion (respect the man who makes an incredibly complex, $200 game).   MechAssault's luscious building destruction is not present. MechWarrior 3's subtractive Boolean driven deformable environments (I think that's what it was called), as lackluster as it is by today's standards, is still not present, and I really like craters. Most importantly, Mercenaries carries the same great, but overly colorful and vibrant artistic style unbefitting something from the BattleTech universe. I like it, don't get me wrong (I even praised it several times in the past), but Steel Battalion's sun soaked, grit and grime seems the more logical choice to represent the brutality of BattleTech. Since it was known from the beginning that Mercenaries was to be built off of a highly unmodified MechWarrior 4 engine with little the way of improvements, fans have come to settle with what's there. Still, is it so much to ask for weather that starts and stops, a sun that rises and sets, a flashlight that doesn't turn invisible and not cast on a lot of things, or a cockpit that doesn't look completely atrocious (someone please play Starlancer)?  Trees are ugly two-dimensional things that still turn to dust when hit, as opposed to the swaying and toppling givers of life that MechCommander has. The ground itself comes with hit and miss textures and blatantly visible seams, but is pretty damn vast. There are also no whiz-bang graphical effects to speak of. The whole ~taking advantage of everything or anything GeForce 3 and above~ ideology flew right over the heads of Cyberlore and FASA and went straight out the window. But to its credit, Mercs features some stunningly beautiful 'Mechs that shoot some killer particle effects. In fact, both pieces of the graphical pie seem to have been slightly retouched since last we saw them. A stumbling foot, jerking from one motion to the next is even less of a problem than it used to be. Pulse laser blasts seem a tad richer, smoke, a tad billowier (though my eyes could be playing tricks on me), and the structural textures are sharper.   Even better, the battles in Mercenaries are several times the size of its pop's. Dozens of helicopters, 'Mechs, bombers, fighters, tanks, and more fill the screen at any given time. Spectacular and managing to add a new dimension of play to the series, the resulting carnage necessitates one command a good seven over 'Mechs (that's two lances) and dart in and out of constant, brilliant crossfires in the pursuit of that certain, special, damaged 'Mech that has been dutifully hounded for the last five minutes. Unfortunately, it seems that the AI sometimes doesn't know what to do about all the mayhem. Because there are so many more units on the screen, 'Mechs are dropping to their knees in a fraction of the time. Getting hit from every which way seems to perplex an AI  unit, as they'll falter, illogically fire at inconsistent targets, and even just shoot at you when all else fails. It's a minor complaint that hampers very little of the overall experience, since cranking the difficulty up, as should immediately be done, and watching Omni 'Mechs crush your hopes and dreams changes everything.   Of the 71 weapons included, it seems that about half have been in some way altered, while others have been replaced (what amounts to a simple rename for the casual among us), and still others dropped. The balancing changes are subtle enough to not throw avid fans for a loop, but harsh enough to rejuvenate combat, refresh multiplayer, and keep things new.    Arrow IV Cluster and the Arrow IV Thunderbolt are new... Two weapons? That's not a whole hell of a lot to chew on. But, Mercs does come with the goodness of Vengeance, Black Knight and the Mech Paks, assuming you have the latter.  Yes, it seems that the dreaded Mech Paks are more than just a fading nightmare we're all still trying to cleanse from our minds. Quietly they are being made out to be even more useful than they are. When last I spoke with FASA and Microsoft concerning Mercenaries, I was told that the franchise is being actively revived and that there shouldn't be a ten year hiatus before the next iteration comes down the pipe. Let's just hope the Mech Paks aren't as fortunate. Spending an additional $30 for a scant few more upgrades that should be included in what you're playing by default is wrong.  New music befitting a futuristic mercenary (war meets industrial) is not a personal preference of mine that I'd take over classic orchestral scores in games of the type. Still, appropriate and pleasing are accurate descriptors. Aside from this, some sound effects have changed, a new computer voice has been added (damned if I can't pin down the accent), and the lead male is a complete goon. None of that matters when the Solaris VII coliseum is reached and the roar of the crowd offsets the Robert Stack like announcer's quips though.  Solaris VII is an opportunity to extend the singleplayer game beyond the story. It's a deathmatch arena of sorts that's relevant to continuing solo play. This is an even bigger plus than the ability to pick and choose where the next fight will be. It's a huge, if somewhat straightforward diversion that keeps the minds of mechwarriors the hell away from the ~Overlord~ mission.  What did you think of Mercenaries?  A streamlined, but not lacking multiplayer functionality rounds out the title. In addition to tonnage, it's now possible to set cash limits, further forcing players to be wiser and more resourceful with their 'Mech selection/customization. In addition to making the pre-join outfit a bit more complex, C-Bill limits also allow for more diverse, yet equally matched bouts where preplanning and forethought are paramount above who's got the biggest and heaviest thing possible. Still, where's the cooperative play? The Multiplayer BattleTech: 3025-like status map that would basically poll stats and rankings pledged to mercenary sponsors and visualize them with a somewhat arbitrary territorial map of the Inner Sphere?   Nevertheless, battle, team battle (where points are key and awarded to players while considering such factors as weight), destruction, team destruction, and mission play (akin to objective-based Counter-Strike) will surely prolong Mercenaries' life, especially considering fans of the game are the most devout around. As corrupt archons fall beneath my feet, their 'Mechs tattered, their armies beaten, the feel returns. I long for MechWarrior even when I play MechWarrior. Masterfully manipulating dozens of keys on the keyboard to flush coolant, switch weapon groups, delegate down orders, blow the arms off a troublesome Thor, dodge a flurry of SRMs, and at the same time jump jet over a small plateau to reach a critical objective that needs a critical murdering is marvelous. It always has been.Mercenaries offers this -- all that makes MechWarrior great -- and then packages it into an incredibly robust, varied, distinct, and different offering that enthralls, engrosses, and begs to be played. The accessible semi-simulation combat of MechWarrior is nearly perfected here with epic battles, a lasting singleplayer campaign loaded with replayability, streamlined multiplayer, intuitive management, and as immersive a setting as you're going to get. If aesthetics, audio and presentation matched the rest of the game in terms of newness, scope and quality, this would easily be yet another candidate for one of the best games of the year (and there are a lot of games to consider). As is, MechWarrior settles with being an addictive, delightful sidestep to Vengeance that does a lot but never propels itself far enough into this next-generation powered future to be the true, undisputed follow-up we've all been waiting for. I guess simulation of the year candidate isn't so bad, eh? Despite lacking loads of original content (new technology, environments, weapons, etcetera), Mercenaries remains the logical next step for rabid MechWarrior fans, but is also an ideal first foray into the fiction/genre for rookies.", "date": "Nov 8, 2002"}
