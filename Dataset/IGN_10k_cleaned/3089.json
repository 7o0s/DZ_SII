A little piece of the web that nobody ever heard of that has since gone away, I penned my first piece for ~PlayStation Interactive~ covering a certain RPG by the name of Suikoden. Involving, massive, and the only Role-Playing game worth mentioning for the PS one at the time, Konami's two-dimensional foray was an epic tale that hooked me in a way that only Final Fantasy had done before it.Based heavily on the Chinese tale of the 108 heroes from the Outlaws of the Marsh, known as ~Shui Hu Zhuan~ or The Water Margin, the premise for Suikoden is taken from one of the four great Chinese novels (joining Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, and The Monkey King). Chronicling the 36 heavenly spirits and 72 earthly fiends, the series has inspired many forms of entertainment since its original inception in the 14th century. Stage plays, movies, anime, television shows, and copycat books are but a few of the various products spawned from the classic tale, but none of them I think, has ever come close to matching the majesty and grandeur of the Suikoden videogame.A coming of age tale following the young Tir McDohl and his eventual conquering of the Scarlet Moon Empire, Suikoden accomplished a rare feat. Capturing not only the epic presentation of a super expensive Hollywood period film, it also managed to reveal itself as one of the most personal RPG experiences I had ever seen. Despite the high number of playable characters, subplots, and sidequests, the relationships between an apprehensive leader and his followers were unparalleled. When characters died, you cared about them. When they turned out to be okay, you cheered. And when enemies attacked your people, you felt the repercussions. Suikoden was more than just a videogame, it was an experience.A few years later when Konami followed up with its sequel, everything I had loved about the original had been improved upon. Characters were more deeply explored, the visuals improved, and the expanding fortress system used in the first game had been greatly revamped. Bigger than the biggest town, your castle wasn't just a tower resurrected to honor your recruiting accomplishments? it was a metropolis.When finally announced last September, the news of a third Suikoden couldn't have come soon enough. Despite the approaching release of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy X, the PS2 up to that point had been a barren wasteland of RPG disappointment. With games like Evergrace and Eternal Ring offering themselves as not-so pleasant alternatives to the fine products we spoiled ourselves with on the PlayStation One, the revelation of a tried and true franchise making a long awaited appearance was nothing short of an answered prayer.After months of anticipation, a myriad of discussion, and enough questions to choke a Dragon Knight's mighty steed, Suikoden III is finally upon us. And while I could hype the final build for even more paragraphs than I've already dedicated to it, one sentence is truly all I need -- Suikoden III is one of the greatest RPGs ever made.Trinity SightPart of what makes Suikoden III so unique is how the storyline is addressed. Told from multiple points of view, the progression of the plot is pretty revolutionary. While another of the great RPG's (Final Fantasy VI) scratched the surface long ago when it allowed the player to choose which of three sidequests they'd like to tackle first, Suikoden III expands upon that idea with the Trinity Sight System. A method that allows players to live the same story through multiple pairs of eyes, the Trinity Sight System is so simple and brilliant, that I'm surprised it wasn't instituted in a videogame previously. As your adventure begins, you have the choice of three main characters: Hugo, Geddoe, and Chris Lightfellow. As radically different as you could imagine, the opportunity to watch a Barbarian Prince, Captain of the Zexen Knights, and Harmonian undercover officer prance around the same events feels almost as though you're playing though three separate games. Considering that each character's three-chapter adventure is in upwards of 15-20 hours apiece, it practically is!While everyone will obviously have their favorites in terms of which character they'd prefer to play as, you're forced to play through three quests before moving on to the fourth and fifth chapters of the game. Playing as every character is beneficial on two fronts: One, you familiarize yourself with towns and areas you may not have visited in other quests for future reference and two: it accentuates the existing plot thread and fills in any holes you may have left over from another experience. In Hugo's adventure for instance, you'll end up battling Leo and Percival at the gates of Vinay del Zexay for an unknown reason. They're obviously upset with our dear Hugo, but nthe reason they give to explain themselves is pretty hard to believe. Play the same area as Chris Lightfellow however, and you'll discover their motives more clearly. To add even further depth to the story, there are three additional points of views that you can unlock to truly immerse yourself in the experience. Though one of them is mandatory, the other two are based entirely on your performance throughout the adventure. And while I won't give away whom these extra POVs belong to, they're well worth the effort of unleashing them (re: find all 108 stars of destiny and you're set).Once you've completed all three chapters of the three main characters and finished the two chapters belonging to the secretive fourth main character, all four stories come together for the final two chapters. The point in the game where the world truly opens up to you, the already massive RPG experience gets even bigger. Sans a strategy guide or FAQ, and you're looking at 60-100 hour playtime with ease.GameplayThere was a doubt among the Suikoden faithful that the transition from 2D to 3D wouldn't necessarily be a good thing. As a general rule of thumb, any videogame that makes its name in the 2D world is forever abstained from enjoying well-done three-dimensional treatment. Or at least, that's how the urban legend goes. Thankfully it's a myth that's been proven wrong multiple times over the years (just look at Super Mario 64, Grand Theft Auto 3, and Metal Gear Solid 2 for the proof), and Suikoden III is no exception to that rule.Falsely rumored to be much slower than it's 2D counterpart, Suikoden III is if anything, faster than the previous two games in the series. Presenting us with a more streamlined version of the previous battle menu, choosing what you want your characters to do is a snap, especially since you only need to command three of your characters at a time. Don't misunderstand though; the standard six-character party is still in full effect. Because of a new buddy system that pairs two characters together however, you only need to select one command per group. It speeds the battles up quite powerfully, and makes an already sleek battle system even easier.From the menu, there's a myriad of functions at your disposal: Attack and Defend are self-explanatory while Rune allows you to cast a magic spell based on your character's equipped Runes and abilities. Select 'Item' should you want to use one or Combination Attack for special maneuvers that certain character combinations achieve (for a laugh, try Melville and Alanis' ~Child~ combo -- funny stuff). Finally, you can run away from monsters that are more powerful than you or let them go if you have the advantage. Suikoden veterans already know how quick and painless this entire process is, and this aspect of the game remains unchanged.Something that has changed on the other hand is the frequency of the battles in question. Eclipsed only by the mighty Phantasy Star II in terms of enemy appearances, the first two Suikoden games threw encounters at you like nobody's business. Because the overworld map now resembles that of Final Fantasy X however (a standard atlas with different points you click on to go from place to place), battles don't occur nearly as much. To compensate, there are a few key areas it the game that have nothing to do with the storyline as a whole -- they're just there to let you hack away at things and earn experience points. At first I wasn't so sure that this type of layout would work for the series, but the more I played and the more I realized just how huge Suikoden III was, the more thankful I became. Another new addition is the skill set. A supplement to the experience points your characters earn, you can visit training and education centers throughout the land to improve individual abilities. And while anybody can learn any basic skill that the trainers offer, only a select few can master them. This allows for a great deal of customization on a per-character basis, and while you could choose to develop only the traits that a particular character has a natural ability with, you don't have to. So while my version of Chris Lightfellow may be a master at the parry, your Chris Lightfellow could have chosen to forget that ability all together (leaning towards the magical side of things). It's a great bonus to the standard idea of leveling up, and adds a nice element of strategy to forming a party.Other standard features of the franchise have been modified or upgraded as well. The classic war battles for instance, have now been toned down to a much more personal level. In the past, these kinds of super battles would consist of 30,000 to 60,000 soldiers at a time, while the current incarnation limits each battle party to six characters apiece. Handled in a war game type method, the army sequences mainly consist of character portrait icons with the five support members in each group. Moving your icons throughout strategic locations on the map, you select what enemy icon to attack, and play out the fight from there.If you find the new army system a little disappointing, so did I. The gaping melees of the games past were some of my favorite moments of the whole army-based idea and I was sad to see it go. This new method works well and it's certainly not a bad thing, but not being able to play with a hundred thousand hyped up soldiers took a little wind out of the Suikoden III sails. Luckily, duels are left almost untouched, with a small advantage/disadvantage meter added to the ruckus to make 30-minute skirmishes a thing of the past. Naturally, the Fortress-building system has returned as well, but this time in a much more conservative shape. Upgraded in the same manner as the previous two games, [Budehuc Castle] grows and transforms as you recruit more and more of the 108 stars of destiny. Not as big as the keep from the last game, the new 3D version of your castle is still pretty enjoyable with plenty of cool tidbits and mini-games to keep you busy. Gambling games, horse racing, and all the shops and stores you've encountered on your journey make appearances (along with some familiar faces from the previous two games), but the beloved cooking game from the last venture has been nixed in favor of recipe mixing for items. Too bad.At least Konami has finally found the right balance for characters, as roughly 70% of them require ample playing time to advance the storyline further. A problem in past incarnations, it was commonplace for players to pick six personalities they really gelled with and use them for the majority of the game, while ignoring the lion's share of their cast. Though you can still take that approach to an extent in Suikoden III, you're almost required to use as many characters as possible. If you don't, you may find out later on that an underdeveloped or forgotten character has a certain moment in the spotlight, and if they're not ready for it, the consequences could be dire enough to come back and bite you in the ass.GraphicsWith the jump to 3D, Suikoden not only sports the best visuals in the series' history, but also the best character designs. Detailed and appropriately fantastic, the unique cast of characters begs your attention. From the exquisite costumes given to Hugo and Chris to the outlandish wackiness of Sgt. Joe and Landis, the art direction in an RPG hasn't been this good since Xenogears in 1998. (Save for Lulu in FFX, she ranks up there as one of the best designs ever).The cityscapes and environments are just as good. With subtle additions and obstacles to give the game a realistic if not upbeat mood. Wandering felines, stacked boxes, and alleyways with hidden couples in make-out mode are but a few of the jillions of visual goodies and appreciative extras you'll find while moving towards the game's conclusion.All those extra details however, end up hampering one of the game's few shortcomings -- the framerate. Perfectly fine when running in wide-open spaces, it takes a noticeable dip when traversing the busy city streets; particularly in the Zexen capital of Vinay del Zexay. While I can accept that games can never find a perfect animation balance, some of the slowdown in Zexay gets pretty bad, and ultimately drops to the 10fps mark. A problem that's encountered for roughly 20-40 seconds the entire game; it's a forgivable flaw for sure? but really bad when it happens.The neat magical spells and excellent combination attacks almost make up for it though. And while the monster summons and Level-four mage work can't compete with some of the more spectacular effect kings like Final Fantasy or Skies of Arcadia, they do a decent mid-level job that beat nearly every other current generation RPG to the punch. That's a pretty big accomplishment.If I had to get angry about anything though, it's the lack of imagination with the enemies. Pretty generic and rarely spectacular, you won't find beasts to speak of around the water cooler until close to the end of the game. Even then, I don't think there was any creature that could compare to the baddies from Final Fantasy X or even Shadow Hearts. If only there was as much effort on the enemy side as there was with the character designs.SoundIt's not the greatest music the series has to offer (I'm torn between the awesome acoustic theme from the first game, and damn near all of disc two on the Suikoden II OST), but it's more than adequate for frequent RPG fans. More Mediterranean and Indian-inspired than before, the score is littered with ballads from the sitar, flute, and old-fashioned guitar. Primarily upbeat in nature, there isn't a single tune that's out of place when moving from place to place.Unfortunately, because of the mood the composer was going for some of the songs are hard to differentiate, and result in a couple of tracks that go completely unnoticed because of their similarity. The other two games had this problem to a lesser degree, but I noticed it more so in the third installment. That said, there is still a damn fine collection of tunes in here and they're good enough to warrant an import album purchase.Interestingly enough, the sound effects are just slightly above average. With a good mix of audio we've heard before in a much clearer form. Sword clangs, arrow swishes, and crackling fire are realistically handled, but in this day and age of advanced technology, I was sad to see that there was no DPL2 or Surround Support at all -- it's just your basic Stereo and Mono variety.Suikoden III is so gigantic, that it could have easily been two or three entirely separate games. Overflowing with character development and a high-quality story that's rivaled only by Squaresoft's equally impressive Final Fantasy X, Konami's latest effort reeks of major league production value. So impressed was I by the sheer size and fun of it all, I came to realize that there is just no way that a single play-through could do justice to this fantastic world.Whether the addictive mini-games like Bodhran and the super-fast rendition of horse racing tickles your fancy, or playing as 108 completely unique and identifiable characters is more your speed, Suikoden III is never at a loss of something to give its player. One of the most enjoyable, deep, and pleasing Role-Playing adventures I've ever experienced, Konami's three-time lucky masterpiece is as close to perfection as I could have hoped. An easy recommendation to any and all RPG fans regardless of their dedication, Suikoden III is most definitely for real. Go out and buy it right now!", "date": "Oct 22, 2002"}
