Ever since we first heard his name last April, Fisher has been hyped as one of the biggest and baddest soldiers in videogaming history. Not even Solid Snake himself could keep up with the intense visuals and realistic tactical combat packed into Ubi Soft's 2002 Metal Gear-killer. When Splinter Cell was finally released on the Xbox last November, it was considered one of the most impressive games of its kind -- and as of this writing, it still is.  In fact, until today, the Xbox version of Splinter Cell was still one of the biggest reason for gamers to invest in Microsoft's giant, black console.  Like a glowing, neon-green beacon drawing the moths to the flame, the title lured thousands upon thousands of die-hard action fans to the growing Xbox army. But that time of exclusivity has now ended, as Splinter Cell finds a widespread release date on the two remaining consoles, GameCube and PS2.  For many, their very first taste of Sam Fisher's deadly world will be through a wireless Wave Bird controller and possibly even Game Boy Advance strapped to their sides.  For every console gamer out there who has heard of this game -- yes, that's everyone -- and doesn't own the Xbox necessary to play it, now is the time.  But then we have the rumors.  During the recent months leading up to this highly anticipated April 8th date, many console fans have begun to debate the quality of the GameCube and PS2 versions.  Nintendo fans questioned whether Ubi Soft would manage to successfully port the beautiful visuals found in the Xbox version to the GameCube hardware intact, while Ubi Soft itself promised that the Nintendo version would be every bit as good as Microsoft's -- even better, it said.  After spending many hours with the final GCN version of Splinter Cell and keeping the Xbox version spinning nearby for reference, we're now ready to set the record straight on both the quality of the ported software and the gameplay experience as a whole.  Tom Clancy fans and action-addicted gamers who have kept this GameCube release lit-up on their radars will definitely want to jump straight into our full debriefing below.  The Facts:   Play as Sam Fisher, a seasoned covert military operative, through nine deadly, lengthy, stealth-based missions to foil an international terrorist plot  Missions take place in realistically modeled environments with impressive real-time lighting, shadows, and architecture  Dozens of top secret weaponry and gadgets that are based on actual field gear currently in research and development by the U.S. military  Context sensitive interactions give players a full sense of decision-making freedom while keeping controls intuitive  New GameCube-exclusive weapon: the Sticky Bomb -- fire it onto walls or enemies and then detonate the shockwave blast remotely  New GameCube-exclusive feature: connect a Game Boy Advance and view Sam's OPSAT overhead radar while playing  Requires 17 Memory Card blocks for saved data  For one player only  Gameplay Despite being one of the most talked-about games of the past year, there is still a very good chance that many Nintendo gamers out there don't have a clue what Splinter Cell is all about.  In fact, it's actually quite difficult to compare this game to any other GameCube title simply because such a game hasn't been brought to Nintendo's hardware yet.  Splinter Cell definitely marks a first true, die-hard, hardcore, stealth, sneaking, military, tactical, third-person shooter that the GameCube has ever seen, and for that, many gamers will be thrilled to no end.  The name of the game is familiar in concept -- fight through terrorist-filled missions that are packed with objectives like ~download the data~ or ~deactivate the alarm system.~  Nintendo gamers have been following such checklists since the glory GoldenEye days and beyond.  But what sets Splinter Cell apart is its precise attention to detail, realism in its execution, and overall slower, sneakier pacing.  This is definitely an action game, but players won't be blazing through levels at full speed with spent shells clanging.  Instead, they'll be hugging the shadows, crawling through bushes, hanging from ledges, and waiting patiently for guards to walk right past them in the dark.  Sam Fisher is equipped with many types of semi- and fully-automatic firearms, explosives, and electronic gadgets, but popping an enemy in the face isn't nearly as effective as sneaking behind them with a chokehold, dragging them into a dark corner, and knocking them to the ground unconscious. As a result, Splinter Cell's gameplay is definitely much more slowly paced than one might expect, but, perhaps because of this, it's still just as exciting as it should be -- perhaps even more so.  When gamers have spent half an hour hanging from a pipe, waiting for a gathering of guards to disperse, and then drop to the ground in ambush, the anticipation alone will create an adrenaline spike like none other.      Players have much freedom in Sam Fisher's not-too-distant-futuristic world and can peek through doors, pick up and throw objects to distract guards, and interrogate unsuspecting victims at gunpoint.  Fisher himself controls responsively and realistically, as a middle-aged heavyweight strapped with 40 pounds of gear should.  In mapping the Xbox controls to the GameCube (and even PS2) controllers, the Ubi Soft Shanghai development team went back to the drawing board, listened to gamer feedback, and truly rethought its design.  As a result, Splinter Cell now plays much more fluidly and seamlessly than before.  For example, instead of pressing the X button to draw a firearm and then the R trigger to fire it, players can now simply hit the R trigger once to draw and then a second time to fire -- a much more intuitive configuration.  The same can be said of nearly all other GameCube control mappings.  Even non-Nintendo fans that aren't already comfortable with the GCN controller will find this version extremely easy to pick up and enjoy.  Splinter Cell controls on Xbox   Splinter Cell controls on GameCube         In addition to featuring all of the same great missions, weapons, and objects from the Xbox version, Ubi Soft is giving GameCube fans even more incentive to buy: exclusive content.  Instead of making this project a straightforward port of last November's Xbox code, the Shanghai team has included a few new goodies that gamers won't find on the Xbox version.  For starters, the design team has implemented a new, freestanding scope that allows Sam to zoom far into the horizon with either normal or night-vision equipped.  Quickly flicking the C stick down will activate the gadget, and it often comes in quite handy while scouting for enemy soldiers or even getting a closer look at a painting on the wall.  This is a tool that should have been included from the beginning with the Xbox.  Another new GameCube feature that never could have seen the light of day on Microsoft's console is the built-in GBA connectivity.  Gamers who own Nintendo's handheld system and the GBA link cable can plug directly into a GCN controller socket at any time during gameplay and get instant access to a very cool feature: Sam's OPSAT map.  This top-down, 2D, wireframe display gives the real-time location of Sam in the level, in addition to revealing the location of nearby enemies, security cameras, mines, and other threats within a close-range radius.  Awesome!  By pressing the GBA's B button, the player can briefly extend that radius and scan the map for even more critical intel. When an enemy threat is detected, the GBA emits an audible beep to alert the player -- something that has saved our sorry hides more than once.    Plugging in the GBA will also give players access to a brand-new weapon (on certain levels), the Sticky Bomb, which, after being fired, is detonated remotely at any time using the GBA.  Stick it to a wall or guard, wait for others to get within range, and then give them the surprise of their lives.  While Splinter Cell fans who've played through the Xbox version might think these features would lessen the difficulty, using the GBA actually adds to the many things that players must juggle in real-time while Sam sneaks around and, despite the extra info and weapon, isn't really so much an advantage as it is simply another damn cool gadget to toy with.  Even our resident IGN Xbox cohorts couldn't help but get excited over these simple yet novel features.  Playing Splinter Cell in the dark with a brightly lit GBA SP glowing in sync with the television is a brand-new way of enjoying this already highly enjoyable game, and we fully recommend that GBA owners check it out. Our hats go off to Ubi Soft for taking the extra time to include it.      Other upgrades and alterations included by Ubi Soft in both the recent GameCube and PS2 upgrades are very noticeable and range from helpful to questionably annoying.  We'll start with helpful list:  When pressing R to fire, the aiming crosshair has been tweaked to get rid of the fat circle in the Xbox version and is now replaced with a much more precise reticle that makes sniping heads a bit easier.  As players interact with doors, they can now directly select to peek under with their optical cables instead of repeatedly trudging through the tiresome inventory menu as executed in the Xbox version.  The use of the D pad has been significantly streamlined, as well, and GCN gamers will even find a greatly improved player management system with an increased number of save game slots.  And the storyline itself has even been given a significant boost thanks to a host of brand-new cut-scenes that better develop the relationship between Sam and his team, his daughter, and his enemy.  They're extremely cinematic and very cool to watch, and it's really too bad that the Xbox version is left with that Crystal Method dance party instead of the sweet, militaristic intro movie that you'll find on these newer console versions.  But with these minor improvements and GameCube-exclusive content comes trouble.  For the Ubi Soft Shanghai team that worked so hard to bring us this excellent title, they clearly ran into limitations in porting the software code from the Xbox to both the GameCube and PS2, as there are many noticeable technical shortcomings in comparison to Microsoft's console.  Things such as lighting effects, texture detail, and the scale of environments have, indeed, all been toned down from the Xbox version, but not universally so.  There are still many areas that look very, very nice here on the GameCube, and had we never seen the Xbox version, our jaws would still be dropping at some of the pretty shadows and extremely lifelike animations within the game.  But for those who must compare and contrast -- as we all must -- know that the Xbox version is still clearly superior in many ways that these newly added upgrades don't address.  The biggest noticeable difference for those familiar with the first edition of Splinter Cell comes in each mission's level design.  The good news is that those who've played through the entire Xbox version will find a relatively new and fresh gameplay experience waiting for them on GameCube thanks to the slightly reworked architecture and mission objectives.  The bad news is that these slightly reworked levels have typically been made shorter and simpler than they were on the Xbox.  Again, let's start with the good news first:  There are several instances where the design team actually made slight changes to improve the level design and make it either more realistic or strategically fun.  For example, the first Police Station mission has been reworked from the Xbox design in two noticeable spots.  The first is where players originally jumped from one gated balcony to another, and in the GameCube version, they've bypassed the silly hop and added a much more practical pipe at the end of the first balcony (images shown first on Xbox and then below on GameCube, each with night-vision shots for added visibility): Xbox     GameCube     Another example is just around the corner from this point, where players must sneak past a guard in front of a house.  In the Xbox version, the guard is already positioned very far from the house, with a Coke can sitting on the porch.  In the new GameCube redesign, the guard has been moved back to the porch and the can is now much closer to Sam's entry point, which allows him to pick it up, chuck it, and distract the century from the doorstep so that Fisher may sneak by.  It's very minor, but the layout makes much more sense in this configuration, and as a result, is more fun to play through. Xbox     GameCube     While some of these level changes seem to be derived from a logical, common sense approach to level design, others are clearly motivated for technical reasons -- namely, Ubi Soft wasn't able to push all of the real-time geometry and special effects for the GameCube port that it did in the Xbox code.  As a result, many areas are now simpler in comparison and lack the environmental detail, structures, and lighting of the first version.  In some areas, levels are even shorter and smaller than they were before.  Below are just a few of such examples from the very same first Police Station level.  This stairwell has been replaced with a very simple corridor and straight set of stairs on the Cube: Xbox     GameCube     Again, another comparatively bare landscape is substituted where an iron gate once stood: Xbox     GameCube     Once inside the precinct, there's no psycho jailbird ranting toward Sam inside the first cell, in addition to being fewer lights along the ceiling and some reworked rooms at the end of the hallway: Xbox     GameCube     Despite these and many other differences between the versions, playing through Splinter Cell on GameCube is extremely fun, and the majority of gamers who pick this little beauty up will never even notice the modifications.  If anything, they'll enjoy it even more thanks to the much-improved controls, boosted presentation, and GBA connectivity.  But for those who've been dying to know what's different about this version and how it compares to its Xbox commander-in-chief, the above differences are definitely things to consider.  Still, as we've said, if this were the first version of the game ever released, Splinter Cell on GameCube would still bear enough merit to more than justify it's purchase -- in fact, it's still easily one of the tactical shooters on Nintendo's console. Here's hoping that non-Xbox gamers won't have to undergo this slightly debilitating porting process in the future for the inevitable sequel.    Graphics It's no secret that the Xbox is a very powerful system.  Many of the latest and greatest games to hit the Microsoft console have been extremely pretty and often outshine the same efforts by third-party publishers developing for GameCube.  So in return, it's honestly no surprise -- despite the hype -- that the GameCube version of Splinter Cell isn't nearly as polished or pretty as the Xbox version.  There, we've said it.  But, what does that leave us with?  Gamers might be surprised.  In some cases, the porting process was extremely friendly to the GameCube, as there are some very pretty lighting and shadow effects still in place.  The game runs fairly smoothly at a nice 30 frames per second, but can slow down and chop up frequently when the camera is moved swiftly in close quarters.  There are times when the lighting effects are clearly ~faked~ by the development team through creative texture work and static lighting conditions that snap to their on and off states, but looking back on it, many of these same tricks and effects were also in place for the Xbox version.  There's no denying that the GameCube port is generally lesser in graphical quality, but it still has its shining moments and more than stands alone as a very pretty action title.  It's also worth mentioning that, in keeping with the majority of GameCube titles ever released, Splinter Cell's FMV is highly, highly compressed and is tainted with very noticeable artifacts.  It's a true shame, too, because the cut-scenes are very well directed and animated, and it would have been great to enjoy them in a clear presentation.  We'd probably be much more upset if we weren't expecting anything different, but developers just can't seem to get their FMV acts together at this point in the Cube's lifecycle.  Sound In keeping with the original version, the GameCube audio elements have been transferred very cleanly and are quite enjoyable.  Both the effects and the musical score are ambient and moody, with only the most minor compression tarnishing their clarity -- something that only the pickiest of audiophiles will note.  The game does offer surround support and is implemented well throughout a typical Pro Logic setup.  Gunfire and footsteps will echo down hallways, fire will crackle, and glass will shatter with the same pleasing and quality samples as before.  And the GameCube optical disc has even managed to pack in all of the same great voiceovers as the original version, which definitely boosts the presentation score as high as it can get for the title.  Overall, a very nice sounding game that will keep gamers twisted with suspense as they sneak through the missions.  The heat vision effect is breathtaking, especially when watching dead guys fade away. Here at IGN, we're big fans of Sam Fisher's work.  There's hardly a soul here in the offices that hasn't played the Xbox version of the game and immensely enjoyed it.  Shoot, I'll openly admit to buying my Xbox for this game and Halo alone.  But now that Splinter Cell has shipped for GameCube, my reasons for owning the mighty Microsoft paperweight have just been cut in half.That's not to say that this GameCube version is superior -- in many ways, it's not.  Ubi Soft's Shanghai team definitely cut some technical corners in porting the title to Nintendo's console, and the results are visible, but not necessarily obvious.  Splinter Cell on GameCube is still a very pretty game and every bit as fun as it ever was.  In fact, thanks to the new gameplay polishing and Game Boy Advance connectivity enhancements, it might even be just a tiny bit more fun for some Nintendo gamers, myself included.  Is it less pretty?  Sure.  But for those who have no other gaming alternatives, you could certainly do a lot worse.  The porting business is a tricky one, and we're glad to see that Ubi Soft pulled this project off with enough grace to put us in awe of Mr. Fisher all over again.", "date": "Apr 4, 2003"}
