That world is familiar and has given so many great hours of fun that it's hard not to look upon the years of set cameras and easy interface with a  kind of nostalgic longing because it won't be too long before the development community completely abandons the idea of the 2D RTS. In what is probably one of the last games that will come out for the PC in that light, Warlords Battlecry does a great job in giving us more hours of fun and frolic in a land filled with nine, count 'em nine, different races.  The folks at SSG that developed this game really did a great job adding loads of new ideas and fun new things to think about when strategizing. And they also did something else, they slipped right in underneath the hype surrounding the Warcraft III RPS and delivered what Blizzard's upcoming game has been promising. But even with all of the great things that went in to the game, there were some bad things going on in the game that can make for some frustrating and annoying gaming.  The Story I guess the game designers spent all of their time thinking of the interesting and cool ways to enhance gameplay and forgot to dip into their creativity when writing the story for the game. While it isn't a horrible story that will leave you wanting to claw your eyes out, it is decidedly formulaic and blah. The story goes that you, the good hero at the beginning, need to figure out why there's undead and evil roaming around the land all of the sudden. And throughout the game you'll find out that two crystals, one good and one evil, have fallen from the sky and herald the coming of an apocalypse. So what you have is the basic good vs. evil plot fare.   But it does get a little more interesting as you progress. After a few missions, you start getting a weird little feeling of huge racial tensions between the ~good~ races of the humans and the elves. I don't want to ruin the surprise or anything so I'll just say that something happens so that you'll have to make a choice between two mission paths halfway through the game. One path follows the light side and will have you continue on your quest for the salvation of the world. And the other will lead you down a road of revenge and darkness. It's a neat little touch that adds a bit more gaming and intrigue. Don't worry about picking just one side though because you'll still be able to go back and finish the other missions after you're done with one branch.  Unfortunately the CG cut scenes that helped to tell the story looked like they were made a few years ago when the possibility of cinematics hadn't really been considered fully for video games. It really isn't good. And I feel bad for saying that because I know how much time goes into making that stuff. I guess I've been spoiled by the excellent CG in games like Diablo II.  The Good, the Bad, and the Neutral One of the best things about this game is the choice between nine different races when playing multiplayer (the single player story revolves around the humans, but you do get to command different races). The races are split into different categories like primitive, civilized, and magical that will link them to different building structures and good, evil, and neutral alignments that will give certain advantages and disadvantages to each race. Here's a little table showing the relationship between races:   PrimitiveCivilizedMagicalGoodBarbariansHumansHigh ElvesNeutralMinotaursDwarvesWood ElvesEvilOrcsUndeadDark Elves   The primitive, civilized, and magical races are different in the basic structures that they produce such as the keeps. The alignment of the races (good, evil, and neutral) comes into play when fighting against each other and the effects a hero has upon the troops that it is leading, but I'll get into that in a minute.  Each of the individual races also has sets of advantages and disadvantages that come along with it. With nine different races, it really is quite amazing how they've managed to keep each of them fairly unique and still balance them so well. When you pick a race to play in multiplay, or are leading them in single player, you get all of the units, upgrades, and advantages that come along with them. There are a few units that carry over between races like dragons that every race can have, and wisps that are the builders for all of the magical races. Each of the races also gets special units that no other races have. The minotaurs get the ultra powerful minotaur king, High Elves get Moonguard, Orcs get giants, Undead get vampires, and so on.  With all of these various things to think about, they really did do a great job balancing the game with unit abilities and the like. There's a bit of carry over between the different races, but you'll definitely see a difference in the way you need to play the game when you load up High Elves as opposed to the Barbarians. Very well done.  The races also get unique buildings that can build other unique units or provide better defense such as the watchtower that only dwarves can build, and the stables that only humans can build. Each of the buildings that are common between races will have different effects depending on the race that you play as well like different upgrades that are available. For example, the minotaurs have the smallest selection of armies with only two different minotaur units (and crossover ones like dragons) so they make up for this deficiency with a whole lot of upgrades that make them really formidable foes.  The Value of Sunshine, Terror, and Heroes There really are a whole lot of great ideas in this game. New stuff that I haven't seen before that really add a lot of play value and open up a lot of possibility for great multiplayer strategy. One of the neatest things that we've found in the game are the psychological effects that units and spells can cause. The effects are Chaos, Fear, Awe, Terror, Poison, and Disease. Each will affect your troops in different ways. For example, if a dragon came flying into your troops, it would inspire terror in some of the troops causing them to get 2 to speed and run away for 15 seconds. This can cause a whole lot of problems in your attack, as I found out last night in a multiplayer match.  Along with these psychological effects comes weather and time of day effects. Depending on whether it is raining, sunny, night, day, or a combination of the two, depending on your race, you'll get bonuses or minuses to your troops combat skill. Humans receive a 1 combat mark at night while the undead will get a +1 combat rating for rain and night.  The biggest and most important addition to this game is by far the addition of hero units, which you create for single and multiplayer games. These heroes travel with you throughout all of your games and cannot die permanently so you don't have to worry about starting up a new character. When you start the single player missions, you will have to choose a human as your hero, but when you play multiplayer, you can create any race of hero that you would like. Pick through several art pieces available to you, give your hero a name and then jump on in. After you have raised a level, which shouldn't take you all that long to do, you will be asked to pick one of four professions: warrior, wizard, rogue, and priest. Not all professions are available for each race and depending on which one you pick, your hero's four main attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, and charisma) will increase or decrease. After you've gained enough experience to reach level 3, then you will get the chance to pick a specialty. These are also race specific, so you will get plenty of different choices depending on your race and profession. This choice will boost your stats in different areas, and if you are choosing from the priest or wizard specialties, then you'll also get some boost in magic using abilities. From this point on, each level that you gain, you will be allotted points to spread around to various abilities, statistics, and spells. This makes for quite a variety of heroes that can be created and used in different ways.  The advantages of having heroes in battle are numerous. Each hero has a circle of influence that is bigger or smaller depending on its command rating. Every army inside this circle of influence (which you can toggle on and off conveniently with the r key) will receive either a bonus or a minus from your hero depending on the race of the army and the race of your hero. For example, human heroes leading undead will give minuses to the troops while a human hero leading humans will encourage their morale, combat, speed, and psychological resistance ratings. Just having your hero near your men makes a huge difference in how they perform in battle and later after your hero is built up enough, it can make a difference to all of your troops even if they aren't in it's area of influence.  Heroes also bring with them, a neat little feature called convert. You may be familiar with this type of option if you've played Age of Empires. Basically, your hero can convert any buildings within his command radius to your side. This is particularly fun to do in the middle of someone's base while a battle is going on. If the defending player isn't careful, he may just find half of his/her base under your control. Generals also have this ability but are slower and do not affect as big an area as your hero.  The last great feature of your hero is the ability to keep a retinue. At the end of each battle, you will be given a list of new recruits that have volunteered to become part of your retinue. You may pick whichever ones you would like and stick them in your retinue slots. The number of slots you have available depend on your level but these characters will then be with you for as long as you want them (or until they die), and will continue to gain experience if you use them in battle.  At the beginning of each battle, you get to spend a number of troop points so that you start out with more than just your hero. You can use these on your retinue or on the regular set of troops available to your race. Each unit takes a different number of points to bring it into battle and your retinue units take a larger number of points. But it is nice to have more powerful troops to take into battle at the beginning of a game.  The Woes of Crappy AI Even with all of these great ideas and implantations of those ideas, the game suffers in a few areas that could be the downfall of the game for some players. While the single player game is fun, the enemy AI borders on atrociously stupid. The attack plan of the computer is pretty much just to throw as many men at you as possible and hope that you crumble under the weight. The enemy heroes occasionally do run around trying to convert your resources, but other than that, you will know exactly what they are going to try to do to you in every game.  Victory conditions often ask you to completely wipe out the enemy units and buildings in the game. This can be a frightful task in some levels as peons scatter themselves to the wind and you are forced to hunt them down and kill them. The more annoying habit of the computer is to have tons of workers around so that when you think you wiped out a base and move to the next one, they'll start putting the structures right back up and you'll find a fully functional and fortified base about five minutes after you left the area littered with dead bodies and debris. As you might guess, this can get very annoying chasing around the enemy, trying to destroy all of the buildings in random places on the map. And while this is acceptable to some degree in multiplayer maps, it seems a bit ridiculous in single player scenarios.  The multiplayer AI is no better. The computer will build efficiently but seems to get confused about what to do after a while if there is more than one human player in the mix and will pretty much stop doing anything after a while.  There is a good side to the AI of the game, although it has nothing to do with enemy AI. There are five behavior settings for your troops to keep them from freaking out and running into a trap. They are cowardly, guardian, defensive, aggressive, and rampant. They range from running away at the sight of enemies to running recklessly through the map looking to kill whatever they come across. It's nice to be able to set troops on such a wide array of behaviors as they each have their uses.  But Does it Look Good and Sound Good? This is pretty standard fare here. It's a bit above average, but the graphics are not why people will be attracted to the game. There are some incredible pieces of art in some places and some incredibly bland pieces in others. The high resolutions are nice and make everything look a bit better.  Sound is a matter of indecisiveness with me as well, because there is some that is pretty well done, and then there are some of the most annoying sounds that I have ever experienced. From the little sprites that make you wish you were deaf to the Moonguard who can't stop talking about that damn LunARian. Ugh, they're annoying.  All in all, if you're an RTS fan, and you want a sneak peek at what Warcraft III might be like, then this is definitely a good choice. There are lots of single player missions, of which most are fun, and plenty of opportunity for great multiplayer games with all of the different options therein. The development crew did a pretty good job staying true to the Warlords series and has done an impressive job making the leap to real time. This may just be the last of a dying breed and is definitely one that RTS fans should at least take a look at.  -- Dan AdamsComment on this story", "date": "Jul 22, 2000"}
