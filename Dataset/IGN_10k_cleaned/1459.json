Originally programmed for the Taito G-Net system (a cart-based successor to the Wolf hardware, I believe intended to compete with the Sega NAOMI), it's made it home to the PlayStation in reasonably solid shape, and to the US by way of Working Designs.  RayCrisis brings back the furious lock-on system you may remember from RayStorm, and while some may find it a little bit limited, shooter fans should have a great time with the potential it offers for honing your technique and racking up high scores.  Gameplay  The unique element of Ray Crisis' weapon system is the lock-on targeter.  Each ship (there are three to start, with craft from past Rays to be unlocked) has two weapons, a main gun and a lock-on missile system.  A little targeting reticle floats ahead of your ship, and when you move it over an enemy vehicle, it's registered as locked-on.  Once you've locked on to as many enemies you like, you trigger your missile, and launch a barrage of missiles or Panzer-esque homing laser bolts after them.  The basic weapons may be a little more familiar to beginning players, but the lock-on is the advanced gamer's weapon, because it can rack you up the most points - the more targets you his with one burst, the higher your bonus multiplier goes (and the closer you get to winning WD's usual high-score competition).  You can also get a special extra-powerful attack if you fire a burst that focuses all your potential locks on a single target, which is a useful tactic against bosses.  The weapon system is still geared more towards refinement than variety, though.  The three basic ships offer a lot of differentiation between them, but you still only have two weapons to use in any given game - the only power-ups serve to enhance the power of your basic weapons.  I miss the cool Gaiares/Blazing Lazers/SideArms/Gradius experience of always coming across brand-new weapons (especially in Gaiares).  There are two main game modes to play in - original and special.  The original mode is only four levels long, and made somewhat short by the unlimited continues, but you can play a different game several times over by mixing and matching three of five different game segments.  You build your original mode game by selecting three ~parts~ (in addition to a starting level that's the same for each game) which you progress through in order on your way to the final boss.  The game also won't let you see the very best ending unless you beat it with a minimum of continues and defeat a special boss - this is not Giga Wing.  That goes for the level and enemy design as well as the continue structure.  RayCrisis has some very dense, difficult boss patterns to push through, but you'll never wind up in a situation where death is inevitable.  Quick reflexes and an eye for developing patterns will see you through, aided by the excellent analog control.  Meanwhile, there's also the Special Mode, a score attack/test game where you fight through a predetermined series of levels, but which gives you no continues.  You have to trust to your own skills and your ability to snap up extra ships to progress as far as possible.  Like the arcade/Saturn pairing in Radiant Silvergun, it's a decent balance of game modes to add replay value to an arcade-ported game - you can blaze through the one, and perfect your reflexes in the other.  Graphics  The PlayStation version of RayCrisis doesn't quite have the resolution of its arcade forefather, looking fairly pixelly in comparison to a number of other shooters, but it's just as bright and colorful, twisting and turning through a 3D world full of giant polygonal enemies.  Like Silpheed on PS2, it makes the most of the polygonal backgrounds, including lots of cinematic camera movement and destructible background elements - even if they're beyond the reach of your main gun, you can blow up some features of the environment with your lock-on weapons.  The lighting effects and explosions are first-rate, and slowdown is very rare.  Sound  Whee!  Shooter music!  RayCrisis actually doesn't have an outstanding score, but or some reason, ordinary ambient game music like this is always much more fun when you're playing a shooter or a platformer.  The weird doses of voice acting and thundering explosions are always a nice complement to the hypnotic tunes. Ray Crisis isn't the best shooter on PlayStation, but I like its structure more than Einhander and its looks more than G-Darius.  It has a lovely style of presentation to it, all done up with vibrant techno design and the wonderful vaguely-English gibberish that pervades all the best shooters.  As far as the depth of its gameplay and weapons system, I'd actually give the nod to Working Designs' own Thunder Force V over Ray - the newness of the levels and ships in Ray Crisis eventually gives way to simply racking up more and more points.  Which has its own appeal for shooter perfectionists, but there are games where you can do the same thing on your way through a deeper, broader experience.", "date": "Nov 10, 2000"}
