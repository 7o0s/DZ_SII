Coincidentally, both happen to be arcade style romps too, although Go Kart Challenge is sorta like a pint-sized version of Breakneck, sans rockets and oil slicks.  Shoot, beer and pretzel HQ is exporting home-grown products like a Comlumbian cartel.  Color me surprised - they deserve to be commended for it too.  Go-kart themed titles were never the rage on PCs and slowly but surely pulled a vanishing act over the course of floppy disc to CD-ROM evolution.  Heavyweight contenders like Microprose, Virgin Interactive and Sega PC lost their shirt on stuff like Manic Karts and Formula Karts, so hats off to Data Becker for trying to administer shock therapy to a dead gaming niche.  A ValuSoft-esque piece of software that screams ~look at my shoestring budget~ through and through isn't likely to be the miracle that revives this lost sub-genre though.  Jumping into the bugger is easy enough.  Step one, set up your driver and vehicle.  Three different driver types can be swapped out for sake of good looks and a trio of size groups (160cc, 200cc, 240cc) denotes the top speed of the mean machines that are qualified to compete.  The karts looking for a good home include F1-C, F1-E, F1-K and F1-H models, which range from monster-truck to common garden-variety types of roadster.  Driver uniforms and karts can be given a new paint job if it tickles your fancy.  Additional tweaks may optionally be administered to lap, time, number of races, and computer opponent variables. Like 99.9% of the budget titles out there, customizable options were added just to pump up a feature list and don't have a striking effect on the gameplay.  The crucial decision to make is what type of race to sign up for.  One to eight players have the option to turn and burn in a practice lap, single race, time trial run, points tournament, or knockout contest.  We'll skip the explanatory breakdown, seeing as how similar choices are found in every other racer dating back to '95.  AI-controlled drivers are the default opponents you'll face off against, though LAN match-ups are a-OK if a few buds wanna join in.  Much as I hate to disappoint, Go Kart Challenge's driving model doesn't deserve a barbaric skewering.  Yes, it's substandard and looks like a pile of poop compared to Need for Speed, but head out for a whirl using the bare-bones keyboard interface and you'll find that somehow, some way, it's embarrassingly entertaining.  Corners could be handled by a monkey, as there's a huge allowance allotted to compensate for powerslide or spinout inducing mistakes.  Since you're driving a veritable tank, collisions won't put a dent in your day nor slow your roll, though they do give the rest of the pack a leg up.  That's no big deal, really, since they're so bad at retaining position that a drooling mongoloid could catch up seconds later, even if said vegetable was blindfolded and tied to a chair.  I mean, hell, you can play this thing one-handed (or with your teeth) using the mouse and it actually works to a point.  Not the most highbrow of concepts, I know, but swallow your pride and the single brain cell joyride'll be worth it.  Tracks, of which there are eight normal and weird ones, are shorter than Verne Troyer's arms.  Billboards, trees and arena audience textures dot the sparse landscapes.  Fog and rain effects can be switched on for kicks and a continual haze blankets the horizon, covering up buildings and rails that pop up out of nowhere.  Further adding to that first-generation Direct 3D look are blobs that pass for smoke, jagged lines purported to be sparks and blatant graphic glitches such as cracks and disappearing textures.  Most of the real world or cartoonish tracks you'll race on take place indoors, though domed arenas with blurry ~uh.. is that supposed to be the crowd or something~ have textures peering out from behind spotlights above.  All you'll really need to see to make a dent in the venues is your driver and vehicle, observed from a behind the back view, though parts of the duo have a tendency to go invisible.  So much for beta testing...  Surely you can envision all vroom vroom sound effects and samples of crowd cheers a piece of budgetware entails.  The ol' bump and grind sounds like it's being filtered through grainy speakers.  A cheer filled award ceremony with drivers who prance about and flaunt the fact that they've hit paydirt is a cacophany of crap.  Hailing from Europe, the least Go Kart Challenge's designers could have done would be to include some awful techno music.  Ignore the box hype; intense racing excitement this is not.  An accurate description would read ~the essential purchase for gamers that need something to keep their hyperactive hands busy with when they're talking on the phone.~  In perspective though, a Slinky works just as well and costs a fraction of the price.
