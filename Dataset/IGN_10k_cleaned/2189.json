WWF With Authority! is a strategy card game, not at all dissimilar from others of its ilk, such as Magic: The Gathering, only With Authority! calls its version of cards, pages, because they're taken from playbooks. Essentially, as a wrestler manager, you're charged with developing the strategy of your superstar, both dependant on that wrestler's preset characteristics as well as the personal strategies you bring into the ring. This is accomplished by selecting which pages to place in your playbook. Think of With Authority's playbook as the equivalent of that of a football team's (duh). It contains everything you (or in this analogy the football team) are capable of doing. Wrestling moves to football plays. As the coach, you choose the best play for the situation and watch the results unfold, ever vigilant of possible counter plays that your opposition may call. Only now, unlike a real football team that chooses each of their plays at will, your plays are for the most part randomly selected. The end result is strategy that hinges entirely on chance. That is, you may have developed, defined, and clearly outlined plan of attack, but the fates may see things differently in the way they deal your hand.  This can be both beneficial and at the same time altogether aggravating. Your plan could fall perfectly in place or you could be saved from certain pin fall by a chance draw, but there's an equal possibility of you coming out royally screwed. The key here is the intelligent, careful, and thought out selection of what plays will come to comprise your playbook, so that regardless of what gets drawn, you'll at least be content in knowing that you made an attempt to create a well-rounded pool. You can of course just opt to go with the defaults, and even turn out to be successful, but more experienced players will find customizing their own playbooks the way to go. What's the perfect customization then? That's impossible to say as it hinges completely on the personal preferences of the player at hand, but everything in moderation is always a sound tactical approach.   Not content with your current crop of plays and playbooks? There are a few ways you can expand them. Trading pages and entire books with other players online is always a possibility, but accessing new ones without the loss of something you already have will be through purchasing. That is, you can't officially bet your pages and books against other players and have the transfer enforced. Which would have been an awesome addition. Nothing like a little gambling and sharking to heighten the experience.   And here comes the catch... The game is attainable both through a five dollar retail outlet CD that includes a William Regal playbook, as well as via the With Authority! Website. The downloadable version is actually initially free and grants players unlimited access to the game's single player practice mode, which is rather lacking. Where they stick you in cost is with the necessary upgrades and bonus packs that are required for a complete and fulfilling experience, as the game revolves around the acquisition of said bonus packs and added material.   This principle is not at all uncommon for those familiar with other strategic card games such as the aforementioned, Magic: The Gathering, but its implementation in a digital format where nothing is truly tangible seems a bit suspect. In essence, the generation of these purchasable pages probably takes little more effort than what is required to create the attributes they offer (it's all just photos after all). So creating and then selling these to players in increments just seems a bit dubious. It's obviously sound from a sales and marketing standpoint, but they're essentially offering an incomplete game that can only be expanded with incremental purchases, but must be expanded with these additional purchases to be enjoyable. It's like if you bought Gran Turismo 3, but it didn't come with any tracks or cars other than a tutorial, and then you had to pay anywhere from five to 30 dollars a piece for additional tracks and cars, that were only released in increments. The concept of an ever-evolving, expanding product that never reaches its limit is intriguing, but more should have been offered in the initial in-store package.  The purchasable additions include new playbooks for superstars comprised of complete selections of plays, as well as booster packs that include an assortment of random individual pages to accentuate your existing playbooks (a certain amount of rarer cards are guaranteed in each).   Single player offers only one truly playable opponent, so the bulk of matches will take place online whether you agree with it or not (that is the point of the game anyway). This leads us to one undeniable truth. This game is virtual. That is, no tangibility, which happens to be a main selling point for other card collectable type games. You spend money to improve a databank of stuff that you own, but the lack of any real personal contact with other players and the items which you've purchased make the whole thing seem rather cold and lifeless. This is the case with every online game, granted, but here it seems especially debilitating, as the very nature of the title better lends itself to a card table, opposed to a computer desk.  Actual play is of course turn-based (throwing cards in real-time would heinously suck). It can be summed as one person, the one starting with control (a random affair), initiating an attack, with the other trying to use the pages in his or her playbook to counter said attack, at which point they would be allowed to initiate an attack of their own. The objective is to deplete your opponents hit points to zero, thus defeating them. Once a player contacts with an attack or successfully counters an incoming attack they are awarded control, and will retain it until their own attack is countered or they are no longer able to initiate a move and must pass their turn.  Twists come from the dynamics that grow from the choice of pages to be used in given circumstances, when and how they may be used, and the balancing that intertwines it all. Virtually all of play can be said to revolve around momentum. Special pages, as well as simply inflicting damage onto your opponents, will increase your momentum. Necessary because all moves require some degree of it, momentum is the driving force behind the action.  All moves require not only a general amount of momentum, but also a certain quantity of one of the six specific types, including attitude, agility, strength, technical, and knowledge (all of which are logically associated with corresponding moves that you would think to require that set of skills). This is developed in such a way so that you can't immediately start out with the most devastating moves, but must instead work your way up to them by earning momentum through inflicting damage upon your opposition or using special momentum adding pages. Nothing like a little testicle rupturing and neck kicking to boost your momentum.  In addition to the wide assortment of moves, there are also wrestler specific trademark and finishing actions. These require a lot of momentum and have special attrbitutes such as being un-counterable. Just think of them as the Rock's ~Rock Bottom,~ or PC Editor Dan Adams' ~Toilet Sit~ (which takes about an hour to complete). These moves require a lot of momentum to execute, so you have to soften your opponents up prior to engaging the deathblow, much in the same way ~real~ wrestling operates. Would the Rock ever walk in the ring and start things off with a Rock Bottom? Or would Dan immediately start out with the Toilet Sit? The Rock softens them up with ~Power Bombs,~ and ~Clotheslines~ just as Dan would soften himself up with the ~Taco Eat,~ and extensive cursing sessions.   Other specialties include less than scrupulous attacks, submissions, and variations on practically everything wrestling. All are somehow interdependent on one another (sacrificing some pages to initate auto-counters, etc.). These minor variations and compilations of functions are good and add tremendously to the strategy, but still can't be expected to elevate the title from anything other than a good outing in an exclusive genre that sadly just won't appeal to everyone.  The interface upon which With Authority! is built is simplistic enough, but a bit cluttered to the first time user. A multitude of easy to discern color-coding schemes and full drag and drop capabilities make engaging in bouts relatively simple and intuitive after only a relatively brief tutorial session and a couple of plays.   Aurally, With Authority! is decidedly sub par. There's very little actual voice in the game aside from what is heard during the character intro sequences; the rest is conveyed through text. A bit of announcer play-by-play and a little more from wrestlers would have benefited the title tremendously, because as is, all we are left with is incessant crowd noise and a few random effects such as mouse blings and blangs.  If you've played that magical game known as Windows then you'll know what that's all about.  It's unclear to me whether WWF fans will be content with consistently laying down small increments of cash to enjoy all the game has to offer. It's also just as unclear to me whether players already entrenched in other strategic card games such as Pokemon, Magic: The Gathering, or Strip Poker will be willing to pay for something they can't molest and sleep with. But, for those gamers looking for something a bit smarter than what can be offered in Smackdown or Raw, With Authority, is as solid a computer game of its type, however niche that may be.", "date": "Oct 25, 2001"}
