However, Art of Fighting Anthology is most similar to Fatal Fury: Battle Archives because both titles gather together an assortment of classic fighting games onto one disc -- and for an appealing low price. Art of Fighting Anthology is not only a great deal for fans of the now sixteen year old series, it's also a nice way for fighting game enthusiasts to get yet another dose of sprite-heavy nostalgia.   Anthology is a collection of all three Art of Fighting games placed humbly on one disc. As nice as it is to have access to these old titles, Anthology is in no way a perfect package. There are no real extras to speak of and even though the games are organized nicely on the main menu, the package definitely lacks sparkle. However, gamers interested in the original Art of Fighting titles probably won't be concerned with the graphical presentation of Anthology because half the fun is seeing how ancient this franchise looks.    Honestly, I had a blast diving into the corny music and color palette of all three games, and as grainy as the sprites are, the whole experience was highly nostalgic and very much enjoyable, despite the slim offerings.   Most of the franchise will be recognizable to fighting game fans because it offers one-on-one fights on a 2D plane, where characters duke it out with varying sets of punches, kicks and special/super techniques. The series also possesses a number of elements that were virtually unheard of when the games were first released. For example, the original Art of Fighting's character sprites are huge (by current standards), and the screen scales in and out depending on the location of the fighters.   Another renowned trait of the series is the Rage/Spirit Gauge, which dictates how many Special Attacks you can execute. Performing a Special Attack will drain your gauge, though it can be refilled by holding down an attack button. You can also taunt your opponent and cut away at their gauge. This balancing act definitely adds to the depth of the fights and prevents players from abusing the game's Special Attacks.   Playing Art of Fighting is a lot of fun, but the first member of the series certainly feels rusty. Controls are hardly precise and playing through the Story Mode can be tough because the difficulty is obscenely high -- to the point of being cheap. Move detection is sincerely poor, so in the end you should probably take this part of the collection with a grain of salt. It's more fun to play as a ~classic~ than approach it like you would a modern fighter.   Reverse Backwards Knee-Root Sword Strike. Nice. Art of Fighting 2 is, as you might expect, more of the same, but delivers higher-res sprites and more Special Attacks per character. The second member of the franchise shrinks the size of the character sprites down and pacing has been seriously tweaked, but you'll once again be met with unflinching, unrelenting challenge. I don't mind a tough fight now and then, but when even the easiest mode can snuff out the very flames of your soul, you know there's a slight problem.   The real treat comes from Path of the Warrior, or Art of Fighting 3. The third installment definitely feels more akin to modern fighters, and while some may argue that it's not the best in the series, it's unquestionably the most refined. Move detection has been greatly improved and character sprites are surprisingly sharp and well animated. I was genuinely surprised at how good some of the characters looked now, considering the fact that the game was made over ten years ago. The difficulty has also been adjusted to better suit newcomers, though it still packs quite a punch as you progress through the story.   All three titles are multiplayer compatible, so a friend can jump in at any time to trade blows with you. The Story Modes provided in this franchise are enjoyable, but there's nothing quite like brawling with a buddy via such traditional means.This is a simple, straight-forward collection for a low price. Two of the three titles included are absurdly difficult and they show their age.  The third title, while greatly entertaining, still pales in comparison to todays fighters. However, these points should not discourage you from trying Anthology out. Its a fantastic experience to visit the veritable roots of the fighting game genre, and Art of Fighting 3 is surprisingly refined for such old software. Art of Fighting enthusiasts should not miss this one, especially if they havent been able to play the games elsewhere.", "date": "Feb 19, 2008"}
