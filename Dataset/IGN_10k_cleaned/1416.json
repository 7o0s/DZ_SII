I mean, c'mon!  You have a hearty race of people who love exploring and bloody battles to work with...and that's just the start.  A quibbling pantheon of gods, a multitude of terrifying creatures...the list goes on and on.  It surprises me that there haven't been more games that use the frozen Scandinavian lands as a backdrop.  Okay, there was the Lost Vikings series, which was actually pretty good, and the pitifully bad ~get it away from me, it burns mommy~  Ring: The Legend of the Nibelungen, but other than that, not many developers have delved into the world of Norse mythology.  Well thank Odin Human Head stepped up to the plate to give us what is possibly the best Nordic game for the PC to date.  While it's far from perfect, Rune certainly will keep you entertained for a long, long time.In Rune, you take control of Ragnar, a young Viking warrior who has just proved himself to his clan.  As an honorable Viking warrior, it is your duty to guard Odin's powerful Runestones, one of which just happens to be in your village.  As the game begins, you get word that a band of rogue Vikings have been sailing around the land destroying the Runestones in an attempt to free the mischievous god Loki from the underworld.  Guess who's job it is to save Midgard from Loki's return?  Okay, so the story is a bit  clich and trite, but hey, this is the stuff that games are made of.  What would you rather do as a Viking: set sail in your warship only to discover boring, icy Greenland, or overthrow the ultimate embodiment of evil and save the world in the process?The action in Rune takes place in a third-person perspective, meaning you can see Ragnar as he roams through the environment.  However, unlike most other third-person action games, most of the fighting in Rune is melee combat.  There are no ranged weapons per se, although you can throw the various axes, swords, and maces you'll find throughout the game.  It actually plays a lot like Drakan, only with much better controls and less flying--although there is this one part...well, I don't want to ruin it for you...Like I mentioned before, your weapons fit into one of three categories: swords, maces, and axes.  There are five different types in each category, ranging from the puny Viking short sword to the mega-whomping Dwarven battle hammer, making for 15 weapons total.  Now you may be thinking, ~Hell, once I get that shiny new Sigurd axe, that Goblin axe is history, so it's really like I only have three weapons.  What a jip!~  Well, it doesn't quite work like that.  Just because you get a new weapon, it doesn't mean you won't use your old arsenal.  While the later weapons cause more damage to your foes from a basic strike, each of your weapons has a special power that can be unleashed if you have enough rune juice saved up, so that piddly bone club may just come in handy in the right situation. The combat system is effective yet simple.  Battles are handled through a keyboard-mouse combination, with the left mouse button controlling your weapon strike and the right used for defense.  Yes, that's right, if you have a shield you can actually block some of the incoming blows.  This adds a bit more strategy to the skirmishes over your typical action game, although it doesn't play a big of a part as I would have liked since it takes too long to switch from a defensive position back to hacking on your opponent to be really effective in most of the fast-action combat sequences.  There's also not a lot to the fighting moves themselves, with only a few basic hack, slash, or wallop animations accompanying each strike.  You can jump at your opponent and spin with your weapon over your head, landing a more vicious blow in the process, but the animation for each weapon is roughly the same.  It would have been nice to see some combo or special moves, because you'll be fighting a lot, and the more variety the better. Another place where Rune could have used more variety is the bestiary.  There are only twelve basic creature models, with various skins draped over them to make a total of 30 ~different~ creatures.  And by different, I mean sometimes you'll be fighting the gray Wendel or the white Wendel, the Viking with the two-horned helmet or the Viking with single-horned helm.  Since there's so much combat, the game tends to get repetitive as you fight the same basic character model through level after level after level.  The creature AI could also use some work.  On more than one occasion I encountered enemies running into walls or just standing around as I slashed or smushed them into bits.  Human Head also promised that enemies would work together to attack you as a cohesive group, but the closest I saw of this was just a bunch of guys ganging up on me trying to cut my head off.  I was expecting Vikings to flank me while one guy kept me busy, but they all just ran straight for me.  Sure, it's effective, but it's not all that smart.  While much of the game focuses on combat, Rune is also rife with puzzles a-plenty--some good, some bad--ranging from the typical ~pull this lever and something happens~ variety to the dreaded (dare I say it) jumping puzzle.  There are a lot of jumping sequences in Rune.  A whole lot.  For the most part, the jumping puzzles aren't too intrusive on the action, and the third-person perspective make them a lot easier to complete than in any first-person game.  But some are just nuisances, like having to jump from pillar to pillar over a bubbling pit of lava a roman sword, a weapon you'll find in almost every rack a few levels down the road.  While some of the jumping puzzles were annoying, the most maddening part of Rune was trying to figure out exactly what you had to do next to get out of some of the rooms.  The game is trigger-based, meaning you have to be at an exact spot to put certain events in motion, like opening a door or activating a scripted event.  On more than one occasion I spent 10-15 minutes running around a room just trying to find the exact trigger point to open a door or get the in-game cutscene started so I could progress through the game.   .I have to hand it to Human Head though...one of the biggest problems with third-person games--camera angle and control--is handled beautifully in Rune.  The camera never gets lost in the environment, and if Ragnar gets too close to a wall, his figure simply fades out, leaving you with a psuedo first-person view. While you can play the game in a first-person mode, it's not very helpful since you can't see your weapons, an important feature in a game that focuses on melee combat.  Third-person game developers take note: Rune is a shining example of how the camera work in third-person gaming should be done.  Another high point for Rune is the impressive graphics, which isn't surprising considering it's built on a modified Unreal Tournament engine.  When you make a game about Vikings, you're going to have your share of snow-lined landscapes and dark, foggy caves, but Human Head makes even these dreary environments look gorgeous.  This is due in large part to the excellent use of lighting effects in the game, which add a lot of atmosphere as well as color to what could have otherwise been dull, drab surroundings.  The natural environment textures are tight and clean as you progress through the caverns of Hel, up to icy Midgard, and through the steamwork-influenced dwarflands.  Character models are also greatly detailed, and Ragnar really looks cool near the end of the game fully draped in animal skins with a full compliment of weapons.  Human Head has also paid close attention to all of the little details, like puddles rippling when you run through them, limbs flying from dismembered foes, and bloodstains on you armor and weapon after a big fight.  Yes, it's gruesome, but hey, you're a Viking!On top of beautiful scenery, Rune also sports some really impressive level design.  While the early levels don't really do the game justice, as you get further into Rune you'll realize that the team did an excellent design job with all of the natural environments.  The levels are ingenuous as well as realistic, and the developers used the 3D environment to its fullest.  The game plays almost as much vertically as it does horizontally (hence the high frequency of jumping puzzles), making most of the 47 levels longer than in most other action games.The auditory portion of Rune is a mixed bag.  The voice work in the game is nicely done, and is rarely over the top...well, at least it's not over the top for the setting.  I mean, this is an epic story about escaping the clutches of Hel and overthrowing Loki, for Odin's sake.  The actor's should be a little dramatic.  I was also quite impressed with the musical cues in the game.  While there's no ongoing soundtrack as you progress through each level, Rune utilized dramatic music that starts playing when you get to a significant area, adding to the tension of the game.  However, the wimpy sound effects just didn't cut it in this Viking adventure.  The canned effects in the game sound like they're right off of a public domain CD, and they distractingly pop in and out with no fading whatsoever, so you may be approaching a stream and, ~bam!,~ there's the sound of flowing water blasting at full volume, rather than rising in a crescendo as you get closer to the river.  If you're looking for a multiplay experience to rival UT, Tribes, or Q3, you're going to be sadly disappointed with Rune.  First off, you're limited to DM or team DM in multiplay.  While this is still the most popular form of online play, a few more game types would have been nice.  I personally think the game is just screaming for a ~Capture the Head~ mode where you have to collect a severed head from each of your opponents and deposit it in a sacrificial urn.  If any mod developers want to steal my idea, feel free...just let me know so I can play.Secondly, the network code is a bit sloppy, and because of this, the game suffers from too much lag.  This wouldn't be such a big problem if you didn't have to be so close to your foes to land a blow, but as it stands, the lag hampers your ability to land a melee blow effectively.  While it varied from server to server, on nearly every server I played on with a DSL connection, I saw several characters popping around the screen due to lag.  Sure, you can throw any of your various weapons at your opponents, but most of the fighting in Rune is toe-to-toe, so you have to be close to your opponent to hit him.  Multiplay has its charm, but it's far from perfect in Rune, and I hope to see a patch in the future that clears up some of the problems I encountered.I have to say that it's refreshing to finally see a decent game based on Norse mythology.  All in all, Rune is a fun little title that adds a bit of creativity to the monotonous action/shooter genre, but it does get repetitive and it has its share of frustrating moments.  While it's certainly a feast for the eyes as well as the fingers, it seems the designers at Human Head thought up four or five really good tricks and used them again and again and again.  It's certainly worth playing for the single-player experience, but don't expect Rune to become an ageless classic.  Now if they can only get multiplay up to par...-- Tal BlevinsWant to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Oct 31, 2000"}
