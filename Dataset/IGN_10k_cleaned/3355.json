{"name": "The Getaway", "name_review": "The Getaway", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/01/06/the-getaway-2", "text": "is amazing and infuriating in roughly equal measure.  Parts of it are as good as anyone has ever done in their particular vein, or indeed as good as anyone is likely to do in the foreseeable future.  Meanwhile, other parts of it are so astoundingly bollixed that one wonders how they made it out of the testing phase.  Here is a game where you can drive around a virtual rendering of an entire real city, modeled down to authentic individual storefronts; here also is a game with an aiming system that considers some bugger 50 yards off a greater threat than a guy six feet behind you with an assault rifle.  One could go on like that for a long time, pointing out The Getaway's various successes and failings opposite each other.  Indeed, I suppose that's what I'm going to have to do here.  Lest the compliments get lost amid all the complaints, though, I will state clearly for the record that I consider this game worth playing.  There are things here that gamers should see for themselves, and lessons taught that designers of future games should take to heart.  However, I disavow any responsibility for broken controllers, anxiety attacks, or strange looks from the neighbors after an evening of appalling profanities emerging from your home.  Gameplay (Driving) The Getaway is a crime picture in the vein of Get Carter and other classics of British cinema, although if you're 12 years old you could compare it to Guy Ritchie's films in a pinch.  It is also two games in one -- an urban car-chase sim a la Driver and a third-person action game whose closest analog would be Winback, if Winback were set in the modern London underworld instead of whatever mutated fantasy world Winback took place in.  This game has ambitions to be more like a movie than anything else you've ever put in a game console, which inspire some of its best and worst qualities.  Its action is broken up by realtime cutscenes that are as good in their way as anything else out there, be it Metal Gear or Soul Reaver or whatever you please.  The cinematic influence is doing nothing but good as far as that aspect of the game is concerned.  It's when the need to make something more like a movie intrudes upon gameplay that problems start to arise.  The Getaway has no graphical user interface in the game itself.  Nothing at all obscures the view of the game world...but on the flip side, there is very little assistance offered to aid in the player's navigation thereof.  This doesn't sound like a bad philosophical decision in principle, but the ways in which it affects gameplay are more questionable.  In the end, it may be the answer to a question nobody asked, as it were -- after all, removing the GUI still can't change the fact that you're manipulating pixels using a weird plastic whatsis covered in knobs and buttons.  Let's Motor  The first half of The Getaway is the car-chase game, where the player can swipe any ride available on the London streets and embark on several different vehicular excursions.  The types of missions offered focus on traditional races against the cops, but there are also a few time-attack races and tailing missions to throw a few kinks into the mix.  Now, when it comes to the pure excitement of the chase, The Getaway has no equal on the market right now.  Driver has aged terribly, The Italian Job was only a modest success, and we'll not say much about Wreckless.  The sensation of speed, the precision of the controls, the individuality of each ride, and the exhilaration of racing through traffic come together to make for some brilliant chases.  Problems arise when the game introduces priorities other than simply racing around town and raising hell.  For example, it makes getting from point A to point B -- the chief goal of nearly every driving mission -- very difficult, especially for players who do not possess a working knowledge of London geography.  The game's rendering of the London streets and landmarks is very accurate, to the point where real-life knowledge can be applied to the virtual city.  However, it offers no assistance to players who might not already know their way around town.  There is no in-game map or any other navigation aids whatsoever, save for imprecise directions provided by your car's turn signals.  This is a consequence of the decision to eliminate the GUI, of course.  There can be no big silly arrows pointing anywhere, no inset maps showing the surrounding area.  Instead, there are only blinking lights indicating whether the player should go right, left, straight, or stop (the absence of a turn signal presumably means you're going the right way, while warning lights indicate arrival at a key destination).  As you can probably imagine, this doesn't work all that well.  The turn signals don't necessarily point the way to the goal as the crow flies, nor do they point towards the turns required to follow the optimum street route.  Instead, they seem to follow a path that combines a little of each.  For example, it's common to reach a T intersection and receive no signal, because the game wants you to go around the interposing block and continue in the same direction.  It might be wiser to take one turn or the other, but the game will offer no comment and a player who doesn't know that particular part of town won't know which way is better.  Even more problematic is the navigation system's tendency to recommend the shortest route, rather than the best route.  It will often point the player down crowded thoroughfares, narrow alleys, or one-way streets, even though there's a slightly longer or less conventional route that would be much faster and less dangerous.  Again, a player who doesn't know their way around London will be none the wiser, and they will often be the recipient of a damaged vehicle.  A blown engine or smashed turn signals (significant damage to the rear of the car disables the only navigation aid) mean that critical time is lost fetching another car.  I really, really, really wish there were a map in this game.  It wouldn't have to clutter up the in-game interface -- it could just be accessed through the pause menu.  Considering the amount of time that was spent on all the rest of this game, someone could have sat off in the corner putting together a real cracker of an in-game map, with indicators for the traffic directions and patterns, major landmarks pointed out, region identifiers, gang territory markers, and maybe even a navigation and route planning system.  A map like that would be a brilliant aid to the player's appreciation of the virtual city, which is by far the game's most impressive asset.  If the car chases in this game are great, after all, the sight-seeing is even better.    ~You're still on the job, white boy!~  The navigation system is the most significant problem with the game's driving component, but some AI issues present other annoyances.  Several missions require that the player drive with a passenger -- usually Yasmin, the hitwoman who becomes hero Mark Hammond's ally -- and those passengers badly need to have their priorities re-straightened.  The car chases in the later missions of the Mark Hammond arc are very long, and frequently require that the player swap cars due to irreparable damage.  When Mark gets out of the car, the passenger must necessarily get out of the car as well and get back in the new one.  However, it's not that simple.  Yasmin's overriding directive is to shoot it out with the cops, since the cops are always hot on the pair's tail, and she will do so regardless of whether or not Mark has a car and is ready to go.  Even if she's badly wounded and near death, she'll likely as not continue in a fruitless shootout until she dies and the mission has to be restarted.  As I said when I played an earlier version of the game, Yasmin should be programmed with one single directive: get back in the car.  The goal of the mission is to get from point A to point B, not rack up a more impressive body count in the process.  If she's a professional hitter rather than a serial killer, she should recognize the importance of getting in the car and getting the hell out of a dangerous situation.  The game also needs to present some of its goals in a clearer fashion.  For example, at one point, a mission requires the player to return to a location and tail a car that's leaving a parking lot there.  However, it's never clearly stated that you're supposed to follow a car -- the game says you're supposed to follow a character, who happens to get in their car and leave right about when you arrive.  I flubbed that mission about three times running because I assumed I was supposed to follow that character around an interior location -- again, the lack of a GUI means it's hard to pick out the target car at a distance and connect that to a goal that isn't explicitly stated.  In other cases, the game requires the player to enter an interior location, but since the only indication of arrival at that location is the blinking hazard lights, it's hard to pick out exactly where you're supposed to go.  Clumsy trial and error is required to find the side entrance to certain locations when the front door is inexplicably blocked.  ~I just polished this thing!~  The problems with navigation and AI in this component of the game grow more and more aggravating as the missions progress, because the driving sequences get longer and longer, and add more complications like time constraints and heavy police interference.  The lack of variation in goals and police behavior definitely starts to show, and one increasingly develops the impression that there's not much to the design of the later chases beyond schlepping from point A to point B.  The fun of the chase can only carry the game so far when it's hampered by issues beyond your control, and on top of it all, frustration sets in at the point when the story is at its most compelling.  When you most want to get through a chase and find out what happens next, that's when Yasmin starts working out her deep-seated issues with authority.  And yet...(a feeling that comes up very often when contemplating this game)...The Getaway is a great driving game about as often as it is a maddening one.  The selection of cars is massive, coming close to covering the breadth of what you might see on a real city street, and the faster cars are an absolute blast to drive, thanks to a relatively simple handling model that still manages to capture the individual characteristics of each car.  The city designers took the time to hide some of the best rides in a few hidden locations, so while you can grab a reasonably thrilling car anywhere, the very best sports and concept cars are reserved for players who take some time to explore.  Crashing into oncoming traffic, missing turns, and watching Yasmin commit suicide is painfully aggravating, but finding the perfect groove down the white line and blazing through a maze of oncoming traffic feels great.  Gameplay (Shooting) Driving, of course, is only one half of The Getaway (or even less than that, depending on how each individual gameplay experience shakes out), but it is probably the better half.  The game's third-person action component is fraught with similar difficulties, but features less of an up-side, despite excellent interior modeling and some other fine qualities.  Its controls and camera direction are frequently very clumsy, and yes, the absence of a user interface has an impact here as well.  As I say, the closest comparison would be Winback, that curious action game from Koei.  The Getaway has a similar style of level design, and has similar character control mechanics as well.  Shootouts are generally slow-paced, interspersing stretches of quietly sneaking about and peering around corners with brief bursts of firing from behind cover.  The key control mechanic for successful gunfighting is a jumpout shot maneuver (similar to those in Winback and Metal Gear Solid 2), which allows for quick shooting from around corners and through doorways.  There's also a nifty mechanic for grabbing hostages, which makes for easy passage through certain areas where the opposition happens to have a regard for innocent life.  The Getaway's stages are heavily scripted, generally requiring a good deal of trial and error to learn the pre-set enemy locations that define the intended path through the level.  Straying from that path incurs the wrath of the recalcitrant camera, which frequently has a hard time dealing with the game's cramped interior environments.  It turns around the character slowly and unpredictably, and often fails to indicate the presence of enemies opening fire from off screen until they've done a fair amount of damage.  The scripted nature of the levels becomes even more obvious in the ~stealth~ missions, where the player must navigate an area without being seen by the enemies that patrol it.  Even more so, these are purely a matter of trial and error.  There are no manual camera controls to make peering at one's surroundings easier, often no indication of whether a fork in the road might lead to safety or danger, and occasionally no indication of the imminent arrival of enemies that might spot you.    ~You coulda shot someone!~  When a straight shootout does occur, difficulties with the game's aiming control arise.  To reiterate for those who missed our preview coverage earlier, The Getaway employs an aiming system that is wholly automatic, or nearly so at any rate.  It is possible to aim manually, but those controls are so clumsy and the third-person view employed so cumbersome that manual aiming is of no use at all in a firefight -- you'd be dead before you got two shots off.  Thus, to take out any opponent, it is necessary to lock on to them by holding the R1 button.  That automatically selects a target, making it possible to open fire and kill them with the square button.  So far, so good, yes?  Certainly -- if this system were tuned properly, it would probably work fine.  However, it suffers from several glaring problems.  For one, it takes two buttons to fire, since the R1 lock has to be established before the game will let you shoot.  There's no option to automatically start firing at the closest available target.  This means that an opponent will inevitably get the drop on the player character to the tune of at least one shot, since they of course can fire as soon as a target presents itself.    Far more problematic, however, is the automatic target selection.  As I say, the game will frequently choose a distant, harmless target over a much closer, deadlier target.  It will also lock on to targets that are hidden behind cover, never mind that a shot could never reach them.  Presented with two roughly equivalent targets, it will not consistently select one or the other, which is a problem if you let go of the lock when a shot or two more was required to kill the first one.  Instead of locking back on to the fellow you want to finish off, it will likely as not switch to the fresh target and let both of them continue to blaze away.  And so on, and so on.  These issues are frequently fatal, enough to kick the player back to the beginning of a lengthy shootout.  I would be more tolerant of the bollixed auto-aim were it not the only option available -- why not implement a more friendly manual aiming system, at least?  I recognize that adding a targeting reticle or similar assist would violate the sacred no-interface commandment, but it would at least be a little easier to judge where one is shooting if the manual aim switched to a first-person view, rather than simply pulling closer to the main character such that his head fills a third of the screen.  ~The lights are growing dim...~  Though I see no way around it, I will probably never get over my philosophical difference with The Getaway's mode of health restoration.  As mentioned before, to get health back, you maneuver the character up against a wall -- he'll lean against it and gradually return to full health.  Injury is subjectively represented by limping animations and bloodstains, which disappear slowly until he's back in fighting form.  I can understand the desire to create an interface devoid of unrealistic elements.  But this isn't realistic, it's silly.  Wounded people bleed out and die, unless they possess (as this game's heroes do) some sort of mutant healing/dry-cleaning factor.  This method of health restoration also breaks up the tempo of action sequences with long periods of sitting around doing nothing.  A few levels try and increase the tension of hiding by presenting enemies that randomly attack if you hold still for too long, but likely as not this simply hurts the suspension of disbelief even more.  Bad guys simply appear out of nowhere in some situations like this, even in areas that have already been obviously cleared of life.  ~So what if I did?~  The Getaway's third-person action component does benefit from some well-done presentation and design ideas.  The interior environments, despite their difficulties with the camera, occasionally throw out some great scripted events and other features.  A SWAT raid in a run-down tenement is considerably improved by the threat of shotgun blasts coming through the flimsy walls, for example, while several warehouse levels include fun variations on the theme of random exploding barrels.  The weapon complement also shows evidence of a smart less-is-more philosophy -- the arsenal is tiny in comparison to most other games in the genre, but it's realistic and manageable.  Realistic, in fact, is a good way to characterize the game's general presentation of violence.  While The Getaway is certainly a violent game, it has none of the over-the-top gore seen in games like Soldier of Fortune.  Rather, it has a mean, low-key style that meshes well with its dialogue, direction, and characters.  The violence in this game looks and sounds like it hurts, even if it's not accompanied by a raft of particle effects and perfectly modeled limb-severings and whatnot.  There is also a mission or two that stands out from the others, since most of the interior levels amount to ~shoot everything that moves.~  In particular, the second half of the game begins with a lovely little shootout where the goal is to quell a riot stretching across a city block.  The immediate impulse is to wade in guns blazing, but the intelligent gamer will realize that he can merely steal the fire engine that sits close to hand, and run over all of the participants in the disturbance while listening to the siren blare.  I suppose I shouldn't enjoy that as much as I do, but what can I say?    Graphics The biggest selling point in The Getaway's arsenal, of course, is its modeling of the city of London.  It's safe to say that this is the biggest and best-looking virtual city ever crafted for a videogame -- though it has its share of flaws, mainly level-of-detail errors that swap in low-res textures by mistake, they are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the environments and the amount of detail packed into every corner.  I've only been to London twice, but I can still pick out individual locations and match them to memory.  Major landmarks like King's Cross Station and London Bridge are naturally present, but as much attention has been paid to tiny details.  There's a movie theater near Piccadilly that I distinctly remember, for example, down to the clubs on either side and the marquee over the door.  An absolutely huge amount of effort must have been put forth to license all the real storefronts (since even major chain logos and individual private businesses appear) and then implement them in the game itself.  The city is so big, in fact, that the game can't make use of all the space given to it.  There are massive swathes of territory that you'll never see just in the course of the single-player missions -- it's necessary to hop in the Free Roaming mode if you want to explore the outskirts.  This, again, is one of the principal reasons I wish there were an in-game map, because I want to be able to see everything without getting lost.  Honestly, it would probably be worth it to invest in a map or street atlas along with the game, because it would be a shame to miss some of the best bits of building and street modeling by accident.  Every car in the game is licensed, save perhaps for one little roadster that might be fictional, and while they aren't up to Gran Turismo 3's preposterous level of detail, they still benefit from environment mapping and an excellent damage model.  The car damage system is up there with Stuntman, Pro Race Driver, and other fine examples of realtime car damage, offering textures and model deformation for scraped body panels, broken lights, broken windows, flat tires, and any other imaginable bit of damage to a car, as well as steam, smoke, and flame to represent engine damage.  The hit detection is particularly accurate, so it's possible to aim precisely and break specific windows or pop tires.  Damage also affects car performance, so a broken car will drift in one direction or another, lose power, and eventually become undrivable due to crippling engine damage.  Cars and pedestrians populate the city streets in appropriate measure, which provides a nice sensation of life to offset the slightly ~flat~ appearance of some storefronts (since the doors, of course, don't open into anything except in very rare cases).  The pedestrian models tend to repeat a bit often, but not to a degree that becomes unusually noticeable, and they have enough animations to keep from breaking the suspension of disbelief.  Repeating character models become a more noticeable phenomenon in some of the later shootout missions, where the crowds of enemy thugs invariably include several sets of twins among them, but again it's not a significant flaw.  The game's interior locations are crafted according to the demands of the mission designs that they accompany, but they are all of them remarkably realistic, benefiting from detailed modeling, textures, and lighting.  Different areas are nicely spaced throughout the game, too, so that while some missions revisit earlier environments, they don't grow repetitive.  The second half of the game actually includes the best interiors -- the aforementioned brothel, and three very well-modeled floors of a hospital.    Every interior includes distinct and individual features, rather than any kind of noticeable repeating objects or textures.  Exploring the corners yields some funny little hidden extras -- a Jamaican crack den, for example, includes a rec room on one floor complete with a PS2 plugged into the big-screen TV.  Like the city outside, the interior levels reward a little inconsequential exploration, so it doesn't hurt to hang around after the shootouts are over.  And with all the painting in the corners that characterizes both interior and exterior environments, it's good to see that the developers took the time to include both progressive scan support and a true 16:9 widescreen mode.  Sound A similar philosophy guides The Getaway's visuals and sound alike.  It has a very calm, relaxed soundtrack, which only picks up in a few key situations.  For the most part, it's tracked with light jazz, ambient techno, and other low-key sounds, punctuated with the odd flourish on the strings when a particular event requires emphasis.  When the game switches to a heavier genre, it's to match the theme of a certain environment.  The Yardie crackhouse  has some great heavy dub playing in the background, and a neat bit of sound design kicks up the volume as you move closer to the speakers (the ones in the game environment, not the ones in your living room).  The city streets are enlivened by irregular commentary from passers-by, other drivers, and police over the radio, delivered with an appropriate degree of tartness in response to violence and reckless driving.  The main characters also deliver a modest amount of internal or external dialogue to keep up with events.  The best sound effects out of doors come from the cars, though.  Engine noises, relatively individualized to reflect different engine capabilities, rise and fall according to RPMs, and produce a particularly impressive alarming whine when a broken radiator is about to go nuclear.  Crunching body panels and breaking windows have a nice depth and texture to them, adding more realism to crashes.  There's also a thoughtfully-added effect for the screech of grinding metal as two cars brush each other.  Action missions feature equally well-done effects, and perhaps benefit more from the stereo sound (the game is not in Pro Logic II, unfortunately, but the stereo sound design is still done quite well), which creates an enveloping sensation during major gunfights and helps localize dialogue in quieter situations.  The gun sound effects are a little calmer and more realistic than most, lacking the thunder found in more action-oriented games.  That's appropriate, though, given the intended tone of the soundtrack and the game as a whole.    Cinematics Breaking up all this action are, as I say, some of the finest cutscenes on the system.  They have a very different style in comparison to most other games, however, because they mainly employ motion-captured animation and digitized human faces.  Little of the character modeling and physical acting in the game was created out of whole cloth, as opposed to something like Metal Gear Solid 2.  This has its drawbacks, but some advantages as well.  The character animation in The Getaway's cinemas does suffer from some spots of choppiness and poor collision detection.  It's much better than it was in earlier preview versions, but still noticeable now and again.  On the other hand, the game benefits from extremely realistic physical acting thanks to its motion-capture system, especially when it comes to interaction between characters.  Because the animations were captured with all of the actors playing a scene together, they react to each other in subtle ways that would be harder to nail down in a hand-animated scene.  Likewise, the character models have their ups and downs.  Each actor had their face scanned and modeled in detail for their character (and the author's face is supposedly buried in the extras cast, somewhere).  The result is highly detailed busts sitting on top of bodies that don't seem to be quite up to the same standard The models don't present realistic hands all that well, their limbs are a little too uniformly round, and some characters don't seem to have quite enough neck supporting their heads.  Smart camera direction helps de-emphasize this contrast, though, and keep the focus on the excellent face modeling, as well as near-perfect lip synching.  In general, the cinematics show the presence of a sure hand behind the camera.  The Getaway passes on the kind of quick, flashy editing seen in films like Guy Ritchie's, preferring slower, simpler shots.  When it does do more complex cutting, it's to good effect, especially in a scene that was substantially changed between the preview version from last year and the finished game we have now.  A sequence featuring a pair of thugs torturing a kidnapped Triad lieutenant is actually a good deal less ~explicit~ than it was before, but the indirect presentation of violence is more effective than it might be if the camera stared straight at it.  It probably goes without saying at this point that the game's dialogue is excellent.  If you have not heard it already in one of the many movies in our media archives, trust that it is intelligent, authentic, and thoroughly raw.  It's an excellent example of what an asset profanity can be, if used appropriately.  The Getaway contains as much cursing as any R-rated crime film, but it never sounds excessive or out of place.  It simply sounds like the way a bunch of hardened thugs ought to talk.  The game also does a good job with different flavors of English accent -- although I admit to being a relatively inexperienced judge of that sort of thing, I can pick up some distinct variations between certain characters, and I particularly like the Jamaican patois spoken by Mark Read in his role as a Yardie boss.  Only a couple of scenes go over the top or fall flat.  It's unfortunate, though, that they have to appear at some of the game's more important moments.  Mark and Yasmin's conversation in the cell stretches a little too long for my taste, and Charlie's big exit scene towards the end involves just a little more scenery-chewing than I think would be in character for him.  The inclusion of ~Rule Britannia~ on the soundtrack is a pretty gutsy choice, though -- I'll give the directors credit for not holding back in that scene.    The ending is also balanced a little off, I think.  It has too much climax and not quite enough denouement -- it reaches its peak and then suddenly cuts off.  It doesn't necessarily leave any questions unanswered, at least none that you couldn't work out for yourself, but I would have liked to see another scene or two to let things down more easily, as it were.  For the vast majority of its running time, though, this is as good a movie as has ever been written for a game console.  It has a strong, sympathetic pair of heroes, an effectively hateful crew of villains, a colorful supporting cast, some inventive plot concepts and twists, and excellent dialogue to tie it all together.  It probably wouldn't win any Oscars, but it would make for a fine crime film on either side of the water, which leaves most of the competition in the shade.In other words, were this a movie, it would receive pretty high marks.  It looks great, it sounds great, and it has a strong story to drive the player through it.  But it's meant to be a game as well, and it's as a game where The Getaway perhaps fails more often than it succeeds.I enjoyed a great deal of this game.  I also hated a great deal of it.  I enjoyed exploring the massive city, I enjoyed driving my favorite cars at a breakneck pace, I enjoyed the occasional moments of perfectly-choreographed action, I enjoyed finally hearing videogame characters credibly say the F-word.  Meanwhile, I hated being led by the nose through the chase sequences, I hated the broken automatic targeting, I hated getting lost with no possibility of assistance, I hated sitting and waiting for a hero to magically heal himself, and I hated having to fumble through a level governed purely by trial and error.The enjoyable parts of this game are substantial enough that I think it's worth fighting through the hateful parts to get to them.  But I'll wager that most players of this game will hate it at points, and if you would like your gaming experiences unleavened by hate, this might be a game to steer clear of.", "date": "Jan 6, 2003"}
