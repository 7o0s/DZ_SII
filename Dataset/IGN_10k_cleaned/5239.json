The series has been a continual monster hit on PCs (although the franchise has indeed peaked), allowing armchair hunters to enjoy a little off-season ~sport~ by tracking deer in the digital wild. Does Sorrent's mobile rendition of this red state pasttime make a compelling game worthy of your download dollars?   Features:   Three locations  Use attractants to lure deer  Intuitive controls   Deer Hunter is what it is. It's a digital take on hunting, hamstrung by cellphone limitations but proof of Sorrent's incredible talent. The game offers two modes of play -- a quick hunt mode that allows you to just get in and start shooting. But if it's more than simple thrills you're looking for, dive into season hunt for a lengthy ~campaign~ against the wily deer and mother nature.   Much to Sorrent's credit, these deer are not dumb. As much as some armchair hunters would probably like just to log in and start filling 'em with lead, the deer of Deer Hunter are adept at hiding, sensing your approach, and getting the hell outta there when your first shot misses the mark. This is not an easy game, and like real hunting (we assume) it takes patience to bag a buck.   The game features three distinctly different locations: Kansas, Idaho, and New York. (Upstate New York, that is. All the deer have been successfully flushed from lower Manhattan.) Sorrent has done a great job rendering these environments. Upstate NY in the winter is a snowy paradise, while wooded Idaho offers thick brush and plenty of hiding spaces. Each locale has individual touches, like noisy loons and birds that erupt from the woods when a shot rings out.    When you play season hunt, you earn points that can be applied to your camouflaged avatar's strengths, such as weapons and tracking. However, if you want to really nail the biggest of the bucks, you better goose your stealth rating, because those deer can hear a twig snap from thirty meters. Padding your weapons skill makes you hold your gun steady -- it actually moves as you breathe.   It may be your high-powered rifle that drops the deer (not before slightly lifting them off the ground first), but before you bag it -- you have to stalk it. And lure it in. You begin your hunt with an ~overworld~ map that shows you the entire area and where deer tracks and deer poop have been found. Next, in the actual wild, you must consider the wind before deploy scents that attract male deer. If those don't work, you can always attempt a deer call to bring out the bashful bucks. Finally, when the deer is in view, you can select your weapon -- from rifle to bow -- to slay the mighty beast.   After a successful hunt, you can visit a trophy room to inspect the stuffed heads of the graceful animals you have brought to justice for crimes of cuteness and peaceful eco-civility. (That's sarcasm, folks.)   The game is not without shortcomings, however. Until you get the system of tracking and attracting deer in specific territories down, you can spend a lot of time without seeing a single buck. For a real hunter, this is to be expected. For most gamers however, this might prove ultimately unsatisfying.  If you have a serious interest in hunting, Deer Hunter is a right good way to pad your phone bill. The ~art~ of tracking bucks and dropping them is as faithfully recreated as this generation of cellphones will allow. However, if you find the sport abhorrent or just don't see its draw, take a pass. Deer Hunter isn't going to make a convert out of anybody who wasn't already pulled in by the popular franchise years ago.", "date": "Nov 9, 2004"}
