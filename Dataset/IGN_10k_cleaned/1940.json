(with its Metal Gear Solid 2 demo), Onimusha, and a few others, but there are still many gaps in between. Now we have Volition's original first-person shooter, Red Faction. Originally conceived as Descent 4, Red Faction somewhere along the lines took a hitchhiking trip with Volition's fancy new Geo-Mod technology into the world of total destruction. And what a world it is.   Just about everything you can see is destructible. It's the ultimate in videogame military fantasy, really. I mean, don't you remember exploring the destructive capabilities of your Army Men when you were a kid? Or seeing how long you could hold a match, or hiding firecrackers in dog poop and trying to lead the dumbest kid on the block to walk by at just the right time? If you never experience the true childlike bliss of my own ragged youth, but you wish you had, you may very well love Red Faction.    Volition's new opus fleshes out a wonderfully malleable world, a destructible universe that explodes differently each time it's shot at, and a game design that certainly accrued many late nights of deep thought. Along with the newness, the freedom, and the compelling story, Red Faction leaves much to be desired. Sony's own Dual Shock controller is partly at fault, because it will never equal the precision of the mouse and keyboard, but Volition (or perhaps THQ) must take blame too, because it opted not to support a keyboard and mouse config.   Nevertheless, the whirlwind tour through which this title pushes gamers  whether it's straight-out blasting, destructive exploration, or stealthy maneuvering -- overcomes the loose ends that pop up hither and yonder. And it eventually delivers an overall tour-de-force of pure action, great variety and depth, and some heavy duty kick-butt destruction. Red Faction is meaty and long. And every time you think it's coming to an end, a new set of obstacles pops into your path.  Story Red Faction is a clever name for a group of had-it-up-to-here miners who decide to rebel against the corporation they work for in the mines of Mars. The slave-like work, the confined work and sleep spaces, and the misery of long sweaty days followed by restless, lonely nights is well portrayed in the movie that starts off the game. The story is certainly reminiscent of Total Recall, and the style of game closely models Half-Life as well, and it's crammed with scripted sequences and a storyline that drives the game forward in starts and fits.   As Parker, more or less everyman's miner, you become a hero of sorts, guided by the Faction's mysterious leader Eos, and your newfound pal Hendrix who explains things as you move into new situations. Along with these unique individuals, several other characters come into play, such as the weasel Griffon, the horrific Capek, and the deadly Masako, all of who are intriguing in their own ways. Although videogames haven't reached literary levels of story telling just yet, Red Faction does a good job of weaving enough storyline into the action-packed gameplay to intrigue most folks in between their near-death experiences.   Personally, I lost and regained interest in the story many times before finishing the game, which didn't grate on me so much as it hung in the back of my mind, like a spider. Compared to Half-Life, on which this game is modeled, the story isn't incorporated as well into the game. [Spoiler Coming] I originally thought that after my final encounter with Capek, it was over. Not so (that's only about half way through the game). In fact, there are dozens of times when you might think you've reached the end, only for the game to continue on just a little farther. It's definitely a nail-biter. The sole fact that Volition focused so strongly on creating a great single-player experience is truly commended -- and has been desperately needed on the PlayStation 2. I only wish the story was a little better.   Geo-Mod Technology Before we enter into gameplay land, let's talk about ~Geo-Mod technology~ first. Geo-Mod technology is, in short, a great piece of technologically advanced code that enables players to fully destroy objects and environments randomly and fully each time they try. Geo-Mod stands for ~Geometric Modification,~ which really means lots of stuff blows up in realtime. Here's how it works: With a rocket launcher in hand players can blast through hundreds of feet of tunnels into rock walls and, given enough ammo, can create long enough passages that one can no longer see out of the hole he or she created. Woah. Giant stalactites can be picked away at in underwater caverns until they come crashing down onto the ocean floor like icicles. Or, thin rock walls can be pummeled to dust, revealing hidden corridors, extra ammo, or enemies ready to shoot at you. In short, Geo-Mod technology opens up an insane level of fun, but it also is incorporated into the gameplay so that Red Faction actually plays much differently than other games in its genre.   Gameplay It appears that Volition had to truly wrap its head around this game concept, a couple of times. It plays differently than other first-person shooters because players are given more than once choice. Instead of just opening the door and shooting, players can blast through wall and surprise the enemy from behind. Don't have the key to a door? Blow up the rock beside it and move into the room. Given the norm of FPS games and their straight, point-to-point missions, this kind of choice is rewarding and provides player with the knowledge that there may have been another way.   Unfortunately, there just doesn't seem to have been enough of this kind of complexity overall. The levels begin with tons of destructible environments, then thin out toward the end. It's not that they disappear all together, they're just not as important to completing the missions near the end. In between the beginning and the end, players experience just about everything: full-on battles in massive canyons, surprise attacks in narrow crevices, corridor fights, battles against strange mutant creatures and pit worms, and a mixture of stealth and just plain running-for-your-life levels. For the most part, the game is well balanced, but the farther you go, the less blowing up of stuff there is. I didn't mind so much, because other aspects of the game took priority, such as locating better weapons (the Rail Driver and Heavy Machine Gun, to be more precise), but the designers shifted their focus from Geo-mod demolition to other gameplay ideas. That's not a bad thing, but Volition doesn't necessarily exploit its own technology as well as it could.   As you near the end, precision, not mass destruction is the name of the game, and try-and-die tactics rule over experimentation and smart placement of remote charges. Control becomes a growing issue. Ordinarily, this would be no sweat, but with the Dual Shock it's just crazy making. It's extremely hard to use precision with imprecise controls, and so later on the game when Rail Drivers become of the utmost importance, and you find yourself engaged in a battle of Eagle-eye shooters, you usually lose. To be more precise, you lose a lot. Luckily, thankfully, Volition enables players to save whenever and wherever they want, which is a blessing near the excruciating ending. Volition tries to counter the Dual Shock with an auto-aim feature, and it does work at times. I switch to it when I want head shots, for instance, and then back off for general purpose fighting. So, the auto-aim does in fact help (like a Band-aid on a shotgun wound), but it's better than nothing.   In between bouts of hating the PS2 controller, however, waves of delightful gameplay will splash across your happy Exo-Suit. Volition's very-near-to-masterpiece code is a well-rounded experience. As players dig deeper into the game, they discover beautiful polygonal worlds that never truly end with a CG clip and a long load time. The nearly seamless ~missions~ that make up Red Faction are constantly loaded (they take about 25 seconds) so that you never really stop playing. This consistent, mostly uninterrupted smoothness creates a good feeling for the game, its story and characters, and immerses you as much as possible in between the many deaths you're sure to encounter. Also, the framerate, which is such an issue with games of this sort, while not blistering at 60, is definitely steady at 30 FPS. The way I know that Volition did a good job with the framerate is that I almost forgot to complain about it.   The other aspects of the game that I simply loved are the vehicles. Players control a hovercraft pod, a mini-submarine, a jeep, a gigantic drilling machine, and an ATV. All of them are capable of attacking enemies in one way or another, and the ones with actual weapons are especially fun. The jeep is mounted with a swiveling machine gun for open-space fighting, the mini-sub is saddled with torpedoes, and the hovercraft shoots off machine gun fire and missiles. The control is consistent and intuitive, based on the same default control as the Dual Shock -- forward and backward with L3 and steering with L4. And the Driller, well, that's just plain fun. It's powerful and plows though nearly anything. There are a few bits that seem to play homage to the Descent series, especially the finale.  I certainly wouldn't forget the weapons and the multiplayer game. The selection of artillery in Red Faction comprises both standard fare and unusual weapons. You've got hand guns, machine guns, and sniper rifles (the deadly Sniper Rifle that punctures metal, and the Precision Rifle), but Rail Guns (mounted with scopes that can see and shoot through any object), Rocket Launchers and Detonators make the real difference. The Fusion Gun is plenty-'o-fun, too. Along with the great hand weapons, all of which have secondary fire and great reload animations, are stationary guns, too. They are pretty rare, but LOTS of fun, especially when they shoot missiles.   When it comes to multiplayer games on consoles, 99% of the time I prefer four-player deathmatches with a Multitap. Two-player console games rarely cut it. Or rather, they are fun, for about 10 minutes, and then I never play them again. With Red Faction, I can see myself coming back to this over and over again, even though it's one to two player. Why? Bots can be added (up to five), difficulty levels can be set, and Volition created a lot of exclusive two-player levels that are genuinely fun just on their own. I found that the geo-mod makes a much bigger difference in the two-player mode, and when you essentially have unlimited amounts of missiles for your missiles launcher it's a good thing. A good thing.   Graphics Red Faction is a truly beautiful game. The high resolution and wide variety of textures, coupled with lots of eye-catching details, such as the Giant Worm and craft design of many ships, are compelling if not simply just purely pleasing. In each new set of levels that players encounter, the textures change or vary, and the color palette is all over the place. Colors aren't all just repeated. With the palette, players encounter the dank, deep browns and reds of the confining mines of Mars. Later, in Capek's Zoo, a mixture of reds, yellows, and even an icy-white feeding tube appear, While inside the Medical Complex, it's all about anti-septic whites and light blues. The depth of colors is great, and the colors are used intelligently, too.   Volition seems to have found a way to create many textures on the PlayStation 2, without compromising too much. Again, creatures such as the Feeding Worm and the giant Disposal Robot are incredibly detailed in design, with many intricate parts, while the textures on them are implemented simply, yet with complexity. The game also does a great job of taking place outside as well as inside. The outside sections are massive in scale and less detailed, while the inside areas are generally far more detailed and intricate.   The characters themselves aren't stunning, buy they don't suck either. In short, the characters' faces appear strangely stretched out, perhaps from dithering effects, or perhaps for another reason, but they're all slightly drawn and contorted. Also the characters' lips aren't very well synched with the voices that are flowing from them, either. Even Parker has his own particular weirdness. If you look closely, he has a wandering eye. Is he supposed to? These are minor little observations that don't effect the game much, but they are there. Overall, the game is polished looking enough, and the character movement, animation, and framerate are all so steady that they're hardly noticeable.   Sound Aside from the out-of-synch voices, the sound department stands on high ground. The voices themselves are generally well delivered, with not too much over-the-top silliness, while there is also a bit of subtlety and inflection to their voices as well. Eos is perhaps the most overacted character voice in the game, while Capek sounds mischievously like Austin Powers' Dr. Evil. Capek is such a despicable character, anyway, that even if he does borrow a little from Dr. Evil it doesn't hurt.   As for the music, Red Faction's sound is not borrowed from some second-rate alternative band, nor is it simply forgettable. Players often feel the scariness of subtle quietness, and more often that that they hear a mixture of ambient sounds that heighten or dissipate depending on a situation. Sometimes the background music reaches toward an ambient sensibility, while other times it almost sounds as if it's techno music from a rave or club. There are no actual melodies that lovingly loop in my head, but some consistent themes pop up every so often that tie nicely with the story.   I suppose I'm spoiled by Half-Life, but I wish that the non-player characters said more funny stuff when you bugged them. You know, they're just sitting there looking at you, and you just want them to so say something besides, ~My orders are to stay here~ over and over again. I suppose, given that the Geo-Mod technology was so difficult to keep consistent and required so much of the developer's time that the voices weren't as high a priority, but hey, I can wish can't I? And for the record, some characters do have more to say than others. I have been excited about this game since day one, and I'm so glad it's turned out well. When I first touched the controller and blew up giant walls, vehicles and whatnot, it just flipped a switch in me. Red Faction is very solid piece of code that, despite some control issues, is extremely fun. The tension of this game builds and builds as it becomes harder and harder, and each time you feel that it's about to end, another set of tasks throw you into more turmoil. The end part of the game is definitely hard (I played on the medium level of difficulty), but in the vein of old-school style of games, you truly earn the ending. I personally had hoped for a faster framerate, more non-player character quips, and more exploration blended with the Geo-Mod aspects of the game, but I certainly don't think the game suffers from the slow disappearance of Geo-Mod stuff. In fact, I believe the game overcomes its Dual Shock yuckiness and just overwhelms you with challenges, twists in storylines, and increasingly difficult enemies (who, when you kill them, offer up incredibly powerful weapons). Also, the enemy AI is excellent. In short, Red Faction is an absolute must-have game for the PlayStation 2, and it's the best single-player first-person shooter by a long shot. In fact, once you tweak the X and Y axis control to loosen up movement (which is highly recommended, by the way), Red Faction becomes the best first-person shooter on the system, period.
