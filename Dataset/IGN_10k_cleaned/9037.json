A.K.A., the three-quarters view. In the days before 3D gaming and polygon counts, it was a way for developers to fake the third dimension. By rotating a normal side-scrolling playing field by 45 degrees, you got a diamond-shaped checkerboard gamespace that offered both depth and distance  but often at the expense of clarity. Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole is an action/RPG presented in that style, and while the quest is a long and potentially engaging one, it's also often hard to manage your movement through its faux-3D environments.   You take command of Nigel, an elvish treasure hunter who's greedy for gold. He meets up in the game's opening sequence with Friday, a flying female fairy who tells him about a legendary treasure hidden on a distant island. She doesn't know exactly where it is, but just the general knowledge that it's out there somewhere is good enough for Nigel. The two of them set off together, crossing the sea on the back of a giant bird, and come to rest on Mercator Island  where their adventure to investigate about and claim the pieces of the storied treasures of King Nole begin.    Lanstalker's action/RPG experience contains the kind of balance you'd expect from the genre. You'll divide your time between interacting with non-player characters in towns and questing through castles and caves to find more and more precious pieces of loot. To begin, you'll find that Nigel and Friday know little of what they're even going after, and even less about each other  but the game's plot develops both its goal and characters over time, in-between dungeon crawls.     The dungeons, then, are where most of the actual action takes place, and where the issues with the game's isometric viewpoint begin to become apparent. Nigel can't walk up, down, left, or right  he can only move in the four diagonal directions in-between. And while the analog sticks found on the VC-compatible Cube and Classic Controllers are more suited to handle this limitation than the old Genesis console D-Pad, it can still be odd to get Nigel going the way you want him to without access to movement in the traditional cardinal directions.   Judgment, too, can be difficult in this style of graphical projection, especially when you're called upon to make precise, pinpoint platform jumps. There are several occasions in Landstalker where Nigel will have to navigate from landing space to landing space, leaping over fall-through pits. And when it looks like a platform is right in front of you, but it's really slightly off to one side and down a bit, but you couldn't tell because it all looks the same anyway, you can see where frustration can quickly enter in. You'll find yourself the victim of many perilous plunges back down to the depths of a labyrinth's lower floors, forced then to retrace all your steps back up through the maze. Have patience ready if you want to embark on this treasure hunt.   But it's a lengthy and interesting adventure if you manage to make your way past the frustrations of the graphics and the odd movement controls. RPGs continue to represent the best value for your dollar on the Virtual Console, and while Landstalker isn't the traditional ~random battles, leveling up~ style of role-playing game, it's got a story and overall length like one. You could be going after King Nole's gold for 20 hours or more, and that's not too bad for just eight bucks.Landstalker is the first isometric game to come to the Virtual Console. And while other past titles like Super Mario RPG, Final Fantasy Tactics and even Q*Bert did a better job handling that style of graphical projection, the engrossing quest contained herein does a lot to redeem the difficulties in visual clarity and character control that that three-quarters viewpoint introduces. Landstalker was supposed to be given a modern remake on the PSP sometime soon, but nothing's been heard about that project since 2005  so this VC edition may end up being your only chance to relive the adventures of Nigel and Friday.", "date": "Sep 14, 2007"}
