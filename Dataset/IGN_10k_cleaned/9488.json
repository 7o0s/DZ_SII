In the case of Infogrames' latest platformer, Starshot: Space Circus Fever (previously known as Space Circus), it's even more suspicious. Not only has the game been delayed more than six months -- despite its finished state -- but it actually made it out in Europe and Australia last year. A sure sign of a crap game then? This is the sad part: Starshot has all the makings of a great platformer, but ultimately fails as a balanced game because of technical shortcomings and lack of final tweaking. The PAL version was finished six months ago. Infogrames could have easily addressed some of the criticisms brought forth in European reviews and made Starshot a good title.Features Seven huge levels. Mario 64-style 3D gameplay with shooting elements. More than 300 different characters. EEPROM saving. Controller Pak not necessary.GameplayAfter a long ~talky~ intro, players take on the role of Starshot, a performer in a galactic Space Circus that travels from planet to planet. Although he looks like a cute NiGHTs reject, the manual of the game has us believe that the star-juggling jester is actually a military tool of destruction and has rejected the ways of violence to make people happy with circus tomfoolery. Never mind the strange French plot -- the gist of the story is that the evil Wolfgang von Ravel, owner of the Virtua Circus, is taking over your territory and is out to destroy the peaceful Space Circus.Much like in all the Rare and Nintendo-style platformers, Starshot runs through fully 3D worlds, avoids traps, jumps platforms and comes face to face with hundreds of different creatures. What sets Starshot apart from the rest of the field is that Starshot can fire star projectiles at his enemies and even direct his shots in mid-flight. The game's best feature, however, is the ability to grab hold of Starshot's personal rocket and fly around the stages at will. Sounds fun, right? With its imaginative level design, humorous characters and original little touches, Starshot should have been a great game. And it would have been, if it wasn't for three fatal flaws: Framerate, camera -- and consequently, control.The camera can be adjusted, but unless you want to stop every few seconds to adjust the view, you'll be spending a lot of time staring at a wall (instead of your character). There is a way to instantly swing the camera behind Starshot, but even this feels awkward as players have to double-tap their button to do so. Sometimes, the camera will change on its own while you're trying to jump from platform to platform, at other times, it will flip perspective while you're running on a narrow pathway. The outcome is always the same: You'll fall. A lot. Thankfully, there aren't many fatal drops early on, but trying to navigate a tight spot and falling 10 times in a row is simply not our idea of fun.The spotty camera views are complicated even more by the fact that the framerate jumps around just as frequently. Infogrames should have added an extra quest to the game: Find the mythical ~30 frames per second~. Sadly, the jumpy framerates coupled with the mediocre camera severely impact the game's control. As original as some of the levels and features are, they can't save Starshot from feeling unfinished.GraphicsVisually, the game boasts a lot of interesting characters and eye-popping colors. Animation of each character is superb and realistic with busty blondes the development team refers to as ~Baywatch babes~, lugheaded army commanders, four-armed slug monsters, and giant mounds of cheese making up just a small percentage of the characters in the various worlds (more than 300 in all). There are also tons of neat little special effects, such as explosions and glowing projectiles.Sadly, Infogrames' highly touted ~I3D~ 3D engine fails to do what it was intended to accomplish. ~I3D~ was supposed to run 50,000 polys and 10 characters on screen at the same time without slowing down. In reality, it slows down all the time, severely impacting not only visuals, but also control. Perhaps Infogrames was too confident in what the engine could do, as even all of Starshot's power-ups and pick-ups are polygonal. If the engine can't handle it, make them sprites!SoundThe up-beat music works well, but since each of the game's seven worlds is huge, it gets mighty repetitive. The fun characters are complemented by voice effects a la Banjo-Kazooie (or the original Star Fox). Starshot's nothing special in the audio department, but what is there works well.Peripheral SupportIt's 1999. The Rumble Pak came out two years ago -- why doesn't Starshot support it? On the positive side, Starshot lets players save directly to the cart, without the need of a Controller Pak.Starshot could have been great. It looks to me as if Infogrames rushed the game out in Europe to capitalize on Christmas sales and then simply tossed it into a corner, waiting for a slow month for its US release. It's evident that the game's designers put a lot of work into designing the worlds and characters. I wish the programmers had taken the time to tweak the controls and camera and devised ways to make the game run smoothly. We don't need to see five polygonal palm trees in the distance if the framerate makes us suffer for the view. In the end, Starshot is worth a look as a perfect example for interesting game design, ruined by flawed technology.", "date": "Jul 8, 1999"}
