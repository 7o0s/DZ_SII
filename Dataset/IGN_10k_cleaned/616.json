{"name": "Wetrix+", "name_review": "Wetrix+", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/11/wetrix", "text": "I think I was the only person around the IGN office who didn't know what in the world this ~Wetrix~ game was as I popped it into our American Dreamcast last Friday.  Apparently, the game had seen incarnations on the N64, PC, and Gameboy - in fact, both IGNPC and IGN64 have reviews of it!  So what is this mystery game?  Just one of the finest attempts at 3D puzzle gaming out there.  Wetrix takes a wacky idea and builds a terrific game around it.  The resulting product should fill the void of puzzle gaming on the Dreamcast, and although it may seem complicated at first, novice puzzlers will be able to get into it rather quickly.  As mentioned in last week's hands-on impressions article, Wetrix is based on ideas that can be learned through Fluid Dynamics 101 at the local university. You're presented, initially, with a flat piece of land in 3D space and have control over tiny blocks of varying shapes, size, and formation, which fall from the sky.  You can rotate them and drop them into place - nothing new here, except you're now working on a 3D grid.  The pieces that fall vary in form in addition to shape.  You'll first encounter a set of red Upper pieces, which elevate the land around where they're dropped.  You'll need to use these to build walls and enclosures in preparation for when the Water pieces start to fall.  These water pieces bring water to the surface, and the water behaves as it should - that is, it flows to the lowest possible point.  Your goal is to keep the water from falling off the edge of the surface.  If too much water falls off the edge, and into the ~drain,~ you'll loose the game.  No problem, right?  Just build a bunch of walls to surround the perimeter of the surface, and you're all set.  It's not that simple.  In fact, once you figure in all the other pieces and events that you'll encounter, you have what seems, initially, like a mess.  In addition to the Upper and Water pieces, you'll find Downer pieces which lower the land that they touch, Bombs, which strike a hole through the areas of ground that they hit, and Fireballs, which evaporate the water.  And on top of this are events, such as Earthquakes.  This particular event arises when the land is made too complicated due to the placement of too many Upper pieces, and tends to spell disaster for the unprepared player, as it reorganizes the land, often leaving water open to falling into the drain.  More advanced players will encounter ICE Cubes, which freeze the water for a limited time, and Rainbow and Rubber Ducky power ups, which raise your score.  I didn't really want to give that whole description to you, as it may scare off some of the less skillful puzzle gamers out there, and this should be easily managed by most.  Of course, there are the initial problems of dealing with a 3D play field, but the developers have worked around this through the use of shadows.  Placing pieces where you want them isn't a problem at all, except for at the higher speeds, where it sometimes seems too difficult.  There are definite problems, however, with the complicated nature of the water itself.  It's often difficult to tell when water is going to flow off the surface and into a drain - something which is essential if you want to come to grips with the game.  This problem doesn't really ruin the experience, though.  In fact, I'm not the greatest puzzle gamer out there, and I was able to get into it after a few tries.  Furthermore, if you're having trouble with the game, you can actually take a stab at the practice mode, which keeps things nice and slow.  This mode was too slow and uneventful for me, but granny should appreciate it.  Once you've gotten the hang of things, whether through the practice mode, or by going through the normal mode until you've gotten it right, you'll find yourself playing the game as it was meant to be played, going after the acclaimed high score.  You can achieve this in various ways, but it seems that the best thing to do would be to create as many ~Lakes~ as possible - that is, separate the water on the surface using the various Upper pieces made available to you.  Of course, you have the added problem that building too many walls will invariably lead to an Earthquake, but the game wouldn't be much fun without this secondary consideration, now would it?  If you're good enough, you'll survive into the later levels, and will encounter the Rainbow and Rubber Ducky events (I've always wanted to use ~rubber ducky~ in a sentence) - this is where the real points begin to rack up.  You'll find yourself playing this thing non stop through the night, trying to top your previous score - it's the kind of mindless fun we all need from time to time.  You can also try out the many variations to the standard game, including the Challenge and Handicap Mode.  The Challenge Mode allows you to have a go at a one minute, five minute, 100 piece, or 500 piece match, where the pieces fall too fast for comfort.  The Handicap Mode allows you to start your game off with raised land, a layer of ice, random holes, or a half-full drain.  These additional ways of playing add some variety to a game that may otherwise have gotten old after a few days of play.  Finally, there's the multiplayer mode, which allows two players to go at it in split screen competitive play.  In this mode, each player builds up energy by evaporating water with a fireball.  With enough energy, you can unleash one of four attacks: a water attack, an ice attack, a quake attack, or a bomb attack.  The bomb attack is a bit too powerful, unfortunately, and I also wish the game featured a four player mode.  Certainly, the Dreamcast is powerful enough for this.  Still, the two player mode is a fun diversion for two players, although better multiplayer gaming is available elsewhere in the form of Worms.  As the first Dreamcast game to start off the century, Wetrix+ is, unfortunately, one of the most underhyped.  Hopefully, the word will get out about just how good the game is.  Anyone looking for a fun puzzle-based diversion ought to look into Wetrix+.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jan 11, 2000"}
