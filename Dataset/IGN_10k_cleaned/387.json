Now, Acclaim and Taito are trying to add another game to the lineup, in the form of Psychic Force 2012.  While this game is certainly unique, and plays differently from most other fighters out there, it turns out to be far too confusing for the average man.  The best way to think of Psychic Force 2012 is to imagine a 2D fighting game in which your characters can fly freely through the air (although it should be noted that the graphics are fully 3D).  There's no ground upon which to walk, and your characters are limited to movement in a 3D boxed area, spelled out by six invisible walls.  Beyond that, though, the game is similar to most other fighting games, including a three button fighting system featuring buttons for guard, weak attack, and strong attack.  The function of the buttons depends on distance; use the weak and strong attack buttons from afar, and your character will fire a projectile, but use the same buttons up close, and your character will unleash a series of hand attacks.  You can do various moves using button combinations, and can also erect a cool force field around your character that can be used for blocking attacks which would break through your typical guard.  Taito has also made a cool innovation in how it implements your life and power meters.  Special moves drain the power meter, and when empty, you're limited in what you can do, and your strong distance attack reverts to the weak distance attack.  You can, of course, refill the meter by standing aside and holding down all three main buttons; thankfully, refilling is lighting fast, so you won't find yourself limited in the use of special moves.  The cool little innovation Taito has made, and this is actually something that can be found in Yuke's earlier Evil Zone, is that the power meter is stacked below the life meter.  As your life meter drains (upwards), the capacity for your power meter grows, keeping the loosing fighter in the game.  I have a feeling that we'll be seeing this in future fighting games, and Taito has done a good job of it here.  While I like the unique means of fighting and the innovative power/life meters, I do have a big problem with the battle system itself.  It's difficult to keep the fighters close to one another, which takes away considerably from the in-your-face nature of fighting games.  Most of the time, you'll find yourself far away from your opponent, unleashing nothing but projectile attacks - something that's good for a few rounds of excitement, but gets old quick.  Even if you do manage to get up close, most likely using one of the various forms of dashing available to you, you'll find yourself utterly confused at the sheer complexity and variables involved in the equation.  Taito has tried to simplify things through two means.  First off, your characters seem to always face one another, as if they're tied to each other by a band.  Also, commands are input regardless of direction, so BACK-FORWARD-WEAK will work the same if your opponent is above, behind, below, or in front of you.  While the characters facing one another is a welcomed feature, the directionless commands feel counter-intuitive.  It's too bad that the fighting system is problematic, as the other features of the game are well done.  There's a training mode, although it's not the massive production found in Soul Calibur, as well as a versus CPU mode that allows you to fight versus style against the CPU (trust me, this is important!).  You'll also find a group of around thirteen anime-style characters, each with its own story.  Play through the game's story mode, and you'll see and hear the characters speak to one another before and after each battle through some excellent Japanese voice-overs, complete with some nicely done subtitles.  And at last, we finally get high res, full screen artwork for the individual character endings - Capcom, take note!  These features combine to make Psychic Force a worthwhile purchase for gamers who like to collect fighting games and people who won't mind the confusing fighting system.  You'll certainly find a lot of game here if you play through the story mode, and take the time to learn some of the moves for the various characters.  Everyone else, though, including the casual fighting fans, ought to stick with Soul Calibur and Power Stone.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 10, 1999"}
