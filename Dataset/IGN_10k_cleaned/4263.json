Even the other two-thirds of the breakfast-cereal trinity -- the archetypes of Frankenstein's Monster and The Generic, All-Purpose-Ghost -- have fared better in terms of overall street-cred (and God knows they've had some hideous movies, too...and not in a good, creepy way).  Publications such as Popular Vampirics Magazine have had to go all the way back to the classics.  Enter Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi.    Nosferatu is a first-person shooter (staker?) that harkens back to a time when certain folk in backwater Eastern European provinces took the threat of supernatural evil deadly seriously.  This is old-school stuff -- gloomy castle corridors, holy water, crucifixes and, yes, stakes.  Players assume the role of a family member belatedly attending a sister's wedding to a mysterious count; of course, the wedding takes place in a foreboding castle nestled in the remotest corner of the countryside. When you arrive, things are not looking good:  The castle is dark, your family members are missing (even the dog), and the only helpful presence is that of a dying priest who's just jumped from a high tower rather than face what was up there. And this is before the monstrosities start showing up.    One more thing:  There's also a game-clock ticking away the remaining moments of  your family's lives -- find and rescue your missing kin in time and they'll even be able to provide you with some help; dally and they die.   Nosferatu, as its very name suggests, has an antiquated, old-horror-film setting and feel, with an earnestly-voiced intro, suitably moody orchestral score and black-and-white narrative-text interludes to orient and move the player along.  Your enemies are the stuff of dark country myth: hunched ghouls, demonic doglike things, pale undead literally rising from their coffins, and some rather less tangible evil presences.  They've all got special spawn-points and hidey-holes from which to jump out at you throughout the various rooms of the castle, and plenty of jolting, scripted attacks as they crash out of the shadows.  What Nosferatu lacks in graphical sophistication and artificial intelligence (more on that in a bit), it does its (un)dead-level best to make up for with strong, freaky audio and some nasty shocks.    On the plus side, Nosferatu features a range of baddies with specific strengths and weaknesses to ensure that you can't rely on one particular weapon.  Some enemy creatures respect the roar of your single-shot Flintlock pistol or other firearms but don't give an undead rat's ass about the crucifix you're waving at them, but the vampires proper obviously react very differently.  The crucifix in fact, can be ~charged~ and released, repulsing enemies with a burst of holy fire -- and can also be utilized to turn ordinary water into holy water (a nice touch).  Stakes are well-known for their effectiveness when hammered into the chests of the undead but, like the crucifix, they have a sort of ~alternate fire~ function; they can be set afire and used as light-providing torches.  Neat.   Between the game's rock-paper-scissors weaponry effects, the dramatic shock-attacks and the ever-pressing need to save family members on the clock, Nosferatu definitely maintains a certain tension; even when you're expecting an attack, its suddenness and sheer speed can serve up a scare or two.  Definitely play this one in the dark and with headphones for maximum impact.   Just to add to the unwelcome uncertainty factor, Nosferatu offers up a fairly unusual twist:  While the very basic form of the castle -- three main towers, a courtyard, and the initial foyer -- remains the same from game to game, the internal room-and-corridor configuration of the individual towers is actually randomized each time, including the placement of monsters, items and family members.  It definitely makes for some replay value.   Now the bad news.  If that whole randomized-room thing sounds a little too good, you may be right:  As a result, there's no mapping, so you're really up against it when it comes to finding your way around the castle.  This can be a particular problem since one of the player's main logistical advantages is the ability to save his kin in time: Once you rescue a family member and return them to the castle's entryway/rally point, they can provide aid to the player in the form of health or items from the luggage they brought (apparently, they had some suspicions about this union).  It's very cool that the need to save NPCs is not merely some arbitrary restriction, but a course of action that really matters within the game-world. Let's be clear:  Nosferatu:  The Wrath of Malachi is not a high-end title by any means.  It knows its limitations, and uses an intentionally-antiquated look (that actually works quite well) and kinetic, jump-and-shriek scares to deliver a budget, but still worthy, horror experience.  Until the next A-level scare-title comes along, gamers prone to the horror genre can consider Nosferatu a sort of light snack -- thin perhaps, but dark and tasty.", "date": "Nov 26, 2003"}
