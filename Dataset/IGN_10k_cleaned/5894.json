Once the average consumer checks their game deck and sees EA's titanic football franchise perched like a buzzard over the corpses of competitors, will they even bother checking out their other choices? So, I can definitely see why Glu mobile wanted to get FOX Sports Football 06 on the decks ASAFP. However, being first isn't always the best position -- you may grab the early adopters, but you also give up precious development time.   Honestly, I think FOX Sports Football 06 could have used a little more time in the hopper. It's a fun, arcade-style football game where casual players are able to rack up some impressive scores -- but serious mobile quarterbacks (all eight of them) might be put-off by the game's easy-breezy play mechanics. Deep, FOX Sports Football 06 is not. But then again, in the face of more sim-ish affairs from EA and JAMDAT, I can see why Glu went the way it did. After all, people buy Midway's Blitz, don't they?   So let's first concentrate on what you get when you DL FOX Sports Football 06. Glu slims the teams down to seven players each, which certainly streamlines the action. This allows for slightly larger sprites than what you might see in a more sim-oriented game that insists on stuffing 22 players on the smallest screen. Not only does these speed up the game, but it allows for some decent player models. Are they as detailed as the ones you see in the 3D edition of Madden? No, but for a 2D, top-down footballer, they look reasonably fine. (I played the game on an LG VX7000.)   The playbook seems more oriented toward faster plays. Offense is definitely the focus here, as each team grunts with great aggression. There are more instances of huge passes than in other mobile footballers I've played in the past, often accompanied by arcade antics like ~blazing balls.~ I thought the control was fine. When I blew a play -- which wasn't as often as in the past (whether that's because I'm getting better at mobile football games, I dunno) -- I definitely felt like it was my fault.   Now, FOX Sports Football 06 does lack an NFL license. There are no player or team names. Teams are called by their home cities instead -- it's up to you to make the mental jump between ~Dallas~ and ~Cowboys.~ Some players will be turned off by the lack of a full license. Some won't care, just as long as the football action is good. I think this will be a much bigger issue with console games than mobile. So, without official teams, you must create your own in season mode. You assign points to categories like ~running~ and ~passing.~   One of my complaints about last year's game was that the AI wasn't as strong as it could be. While I think things have gotten better, I believe there was still work to be done with FOX Sports Football 06. While I did say that I think the game is more geared toward offense, I did want a little more snap to my opponent's defense. Where are the interceptions? Where are the sacks? These happen, but not very often.   FOX Sports Football 06 does have good presentation. The FOX Sports licensed is leveraged well. The trimmings look good, like a mobile telecast. The audio is also good, with some nice music cues and in-game sound effects.  I have played every version of FOX Sports Football that Glu has created, and it's been interesting to watch the franchise develop. I like the more arcade flair of FOX Sports Football 06, as I think it works well on mobile. Without a fat controller with a zillion buttons, it's easier to get into a more streamlined game.However, FOX Sports Football 06 isn't a big leap from last year's game. Some problems have been cleaned up, but others haven't. I wanted a more aggressive game. I wanted to see one or two brand new in-game features that really let me know I was playing a new football game, not an update. For next year's update, should Glu stick with football, I think a complete overhaul is in order, just like when the firm went from the old passing-only games (remember 2002?) to these top-down football games with offense and defense. FOX Sports Football 06 isn't to be avoided, but it should be downloaded with consideration. If you want an arcade game with easy play and high scoring, then FOX Sports Football 06 is going to likely satisfy. But if you want something to really chew on, you may wish to bide your time and wait to see how all of the players look on the field later this season.", "date": "Jul 23, 2005"}
