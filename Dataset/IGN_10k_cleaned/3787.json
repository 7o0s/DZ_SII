If we had to do the vote all over again, not only would NCAA Football 2004 replace its predecessor on the list, it would probably get bumped up a few spots in prestige as well.  If you're a fan of college football, pro football, or the football where they kick the bloody ball and don't use their hands, hell, if you ever ordered a subscription to Sports Illustrated and received the football phone as a free gift, you will rejoice in the atmosphere, the excitement, and the sheer greatness that is NCAA Football 2004.  That being said, one of the main additions to the game is online play. And while that's reason alone to high step to the store and spike the cash register, the game's only online for PlayStation 2, and what's worth singing about on one system is like a slap in the face to the other two, especially the Xbox, where sports games are all the rage and the online capabilities of Live continue to reign supreme. Unfortunately, Live must continue its reign without the support of EA, so if you're looking to rule with your school online, the PlayStation 2 version is your only choice.  The great thing about NCAA, though, is even without online play, the game is so much superior to most football titles on the market and is packed with so many features and gameplay modes, that you will still be busy recruiting players in your twentieth franchise season before you realize the real college football season has already ended. Who needs to know the national champ, anyway? I guarantee you'll be so wrapped up in your season and your created school, that people will ask what college you attend and you might shout out ~J-Rob U~ (or your equivalent, although feel free to make J-Rob U) just by sheer involvement. Sad as it is to say, I've spent way more time at J-Rob U then I ever did in class, but what can I say, at least I'm number one in the nation.  Head-to-Head Available! Don't know which version of NCAA Football 2004 is right for you? We tell you in this point-by-point breakdown with side-by-side screenshots and tons of info.  And, our experienced strategy writers have crafted a highly detailed guide with tons of great tips. Get it at IGN Guides now.  Links :: Video Review | Read It Now |      Keeping on the historic tip, the game also clocks in with a new College Classics mode where you are thrown in some of the most desperate situations in college football history and expected to pull out some of the same miracles as the likes of Flutie, Kordell, and the Cal return team. If you're able to complete the objective and remake, or in some cases like last year's title game (there was no pass interference!), rewrite history, you are rewarded as both teams will then become unlocked for play. This mode really adds a lot to the replayability, as you try to actually lateral the ball down the field on The Play and work your way through the Stanford special teams or take control of Donovan McNabb the day he puked all over the field only to lead his Syracuse squad to victory. My only complaint here is the fact that if you fail to achieve the desired result, you can't simply restart the game right away. You actually have to go all the way back, select the game again and go through all the screens a second time just to get a second chance. I guess it's a small penalty to pay for your lack of skills, but some of the games are really hard to pull off, and it would save a lot of time if you could simply start over from the Final Score screen.  The coolest and most talked about feature in NCAA Football, though, is still the ability to create your own school from scratch, enroll them in Dynasty mode, and try to work your way past the powerhouses like Miami and Ohio State on your way to #1. That means recruiting the right players to fit your system and school (depending on everything from play style to location), hiring the right coaches and giving them contract extensions before they have the chance to leave, reworking your schedule in order to face as many ranked opponents as possible, and of course, running up the score any chance you get. As you progress from week to week, depending on what happened around the country, a player will be picked to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated with a headline that talks about the shocking upset or why your rifle-armed QB is the top candidate to win the Heisman. If you decide to go into the player editor and actually name all of the players, whatever name you typed in for the player on the cover will appear on the cover, whether you decide to name the speedy receiver from Texas after yourself or go factual and call him Roy Williams. This really adds something to each week as you play your butt off trying to actually get one of your players on the cover. When it finally happens, it's extremely rewarding. You can even save a season's worth of covers to look back and reflect upon. Unfortunately, once you start your next season, you lose the covers from the previous year.  In terms of the new hotness, NCAA Football 2004 is the first game to utilize the EA Sports Bio feature now included in all upcoming EA Sports games. The Bio tracks all of your accomplishments in the game and across all of the EA Sports brands from Madden to NBA Live and rewards you as you achieve certain levels of success by unlocking secrets not only in the game you're playing, but in other EA Sports titles as well. For example, when I first started playing NCAA and reached EA Sports level 10, I unlocked a few stadiums and various other goodies, then I popped in my advanced copy of Madden and within seconds of turning it on was rewarded with a number of Madden Cards and hidden bonuses.     The more you play the EA Sports games, the more things you can unlock, as the Bio not only counts accomplishments like Super Bowl wins and National Championships, but also the exact number of hours, minutes, and seconds you spend playing EA Sports games. It's a number you might want to hide from your parents, your wife, husband, or all of the above, depending on your freaky situation.   Another hot new feature is the Greatest Games mode. We've all played games where the score was like 49-48 with two seconds left and by some strange string of events, a few laterals, and maybe a stiff arm to the safety, you break free and score the winning touchdown. Whether you made the play or were the one left in disbelief as your friend busts out a cabbage patch in your living room, there's no denying you just played a great game. NCAA now tracks your 10 greatest games and actually ranks them in order of greatness. When you click on the game you can review everything from the box score to the player of the game. It's a small thing, but it's another feature that feels rewarding and reassuring that the game you just played will be remembered in your memory and the memory of your game system for years.   In addition, NCAA also keeps track of career and school records, and even includes a trophy room to display all of your player awards and conference championship trophies.  Gameplay The biggest complaint I've had throughout the history of the NCAA Football series has been the erratic and occasionally just plain horrid play of the defensive backs. They'd be in the right position, but just couldn't make a play if their scholarships and all the cheerleaders they could handle were riding on it. Even if picking passes is too much to ask for, at least knock down the damn ball, I mean, we're playing in the Rose Bowl here, kid, make a play.   Thankfully, this problem has been addressed, as corners and safeties not only play the ball more aggressively and intercept ill-advised passes, they'll even make plays on balls they can't pick and actually swipe at the pigskin and chop it down. Finally! A game where you feel you can make plays on defense and that every game is not going to be a shootout full of long bombs and busted coverage.  Another improvement comes in the way of blocking. Your players will work for you far down the field trying to open holes, even blindsiding defenders unaware of their dangerous surroundings. This takes place on special teams as well as your teammates wrestle non-stop, forming wedges and creating seams in order to clear a path back to paydirt. Once you reached the promised land, you can even choose to dunk the ball over the goalpost or jump into a Heisman pose utilizing one of eight Custom Celebrations you trigger by hitting the right buttons as you cross the goal line. You might get an unsportsmanlike penalty for mocking your opponent, but it's well worth the price of 15 yards and a yellow flag.  Other new enhancements that will help lead you to the house are the new camera angles involved in all play-action passes and draw plays. This will sucker in even the most seasoned football gamer, as the camera actually closes in on the running back during a play-action pass, then zooms back out into the passing window. But by that time, the linebackers and safeties might have already bitten, and the passing lanes have completely opened up. The opposite holds true for draws. The camera pulls back and the passing icons actually pop up like it's a pass play even though the quarterback just handed the ball to the running back on the delay. Masterful stuff that really brings the spirit of these fakes and deceptions into the reality of the game.  Speaking of deception, NCAA also boasts an outrageous number of new trick plays, from the double end around pass back to the quarterback to simpler wingback reverses, if there's a trick play you've always wanted to try in a videogame, chances are you'll find it in this one.  Beyond those major improvements, the gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect if you played any of the previous version in the series. There are plenty of other subtle upgrades, from new tackles to the way receivers actually turn their heads to look back for the ball, but if you're not a die-hard football fan, you probably won't appreciate just how cool that is.     > Graphics Authentic intros featuring players running out of tunnels add to the spirit of each contest, and the fact that they even added the Notre Dame team entrance where they pound the Play Like A Champion plaque shows the level of detail the designers were willing to capture.   On the field you'll see new tackle animations near the sidelines, players stumbling after a hit, and as the camera zooms in after a touchdown, you'll even see the raw emotion detailed on the player's faces as they let out a scream while flexing for the cameras. The camera angles, like I mentioned earlier in regard to the play-action pass, have also been utilized more to become an asset, not a liability of the gameplay. Beyond play-action and draws, when the quarterback rolls out of the pocket, the camera rolls out with him and pivots to the wide side of the field so you have a better look at the entire landscape, not just the sideline area you're running toward.   One feature that was taken out at the last second, though, was the animation of the crowd storming the field and ripping down the goalposts. I guess the NCAA doesn't condone that type of behavior in real life, so EA doesn't condone it in the game, although it sure would've been cool to see.  When broken down side-by-side, the Xbox version is definitely the best looking of the three systems, as the game supports HDTV 480P and delivers the sharpest looking athletes, cheerleaders and mascots this side of The Fiesta Bowl. Beyond the Box, it's a mixed bag. The PS2 version is highlighted by a sharp, vibrant look, while the GameCube features a more saturated appearance.  Sound One of the aspects the developers really focused on for 2004 was the sound. The way the crowd reacts, the fight songs, the grunts and groans on the field all lend an air of authenticity to a game when done right, and this year they set out to make some marked improvements. Not only do you hear cannons firing, you have the addition of new school fight songs, and you finally have a crowd that reacts to the plays on the field.   If you're playing a game at home and throw a 10-yard slant, the crowd might cheer a little. But break a tackle and burst into the open field and you'll hear the cheers grow louder until they start going out of their minds as you cross the goal. There are also a number of situational chants, like the crowd urging you to go for it on fourth down, that just capture everything you know and love about the game of football, whether you're a fan or a player.NCAA Football 2004 is a game so good, it has no competition. That's right, Sega backed off of this year's college football race, so if you're a fan of amateur athletics, this is the only game available this season. Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, even if there was a choice, there really wouldn't be a choice, NCAA Football 2004 is just that damn fun. From creating schools to recruiting players to fighting for your shot at number one, every aspect from the gameplay to the gridiron has been improved over its predecessor and once again takes the series to that next level. If you own multiple systems and are trying to choose the best version to buy, it really comes down to whether or not you plan to play online. If that's the case, buy the PS2 version. If not, the Xbox version looks a bit better but that's really the only thing that distinguishes it. The Cube game looks the worst of the three and the controller is a bit frustrating to tackle, so while the game is still fun on its own, if you own another system, leave your Cube for Link and hit the field on your PS2 or Xbox.", "date": "Jul 16, 2003"}
