Thus, the firm is introducing 3D Pool, which we downloaded earlier this week on our workhorse LG VX6000, so we could have a peek-see at what the average Joe Q. McHandset can play. No fancy version for us!   3D Pool is just that, a game of pool shown in 3D. The game does include a top-down 2D mode, but really, who wants to look at that when they have the option for 3D? We'll tell you who: us. At least, us using the VX6000, because the 3D effects are pretty unspectacular. We appreciate the effort, but the execution on this handset -- whose users number in the millions -- is just so herky-jerky that we ran crying to the 2D mode within minutes. At best, we found it easier to set up our shots while looking down at the table rather than desperately try to line up a shot one... frame... at... a... time.   Once the shot gets lined up, using the power and spin meters are remarkably easy and we were able to get the shots we wanted -- which really alleviated our initial frustration with the title. So, once you get past the 3D gimmick which actually puts a little bit of a hindrance on the game, you discover that 3D Pool offers quite a solid experience.   3D Pool offers both 8-ball and 9-ball games. You can use a practice mode to get used to the controls before either engaging a human competitor in a two-player match (you just pass the phone back and forth), or struggle against some pretty vicious competition. There are eight AI-competitors that ramp up in toughness fairly quickly, so don't be lulled by hustling the first couple comers. Smugness will bite your heine mighty fast against the pool czars of 3D Pool. In addition to the regular pool modes, 3D Pool also includes a trick shot contest.   We already covered some of our beefs with 3D Pool's 3D engine, but must point out that the ~after shot~ angle showing the action is nice. There is little extra detail to the table to distract from play. The felt colors can be customized. And each of your competitors has an avatar -- however unthreatening as they may be. There is very little sound in 3D Pool -- especially the 6000 version. Apparently some of the more refined versions have extra sound effects, such as the clack of the balls hitting each other, but our version of 3D Pool does not. Just a small noise when the cue hits the ball.3D Pool actually might have benefited from ditching the unimpressive 3D stuff and just concentrating on the pool game at hand. I tried to set up shots using the 3D angles, but it was such a paint hat I quickly abandoned it for a basic 2D mode. The game went not only smoother, but also faster. However, the pool game itself is very solid -- and if you're a fan of the sport -- a good download. Digital bridges' 3D Pool does have competition, though, so I'm hoping the next version of the game has some improvements.", "date": "Jan 20, 2005"}
