The thought of such a classic board game on the Nintendo 64 may seem a blasphemous to board game purists, but the videogame stays true to the spirit of the Parker Brothers masterpiece. It's still all about property, excessive greed and money management, but automated money exchanges, customized gameplay options and animated tokens shake loose every bit of 3D excitement that may have been hiding in that old Monopoly box. The Features   3D graphics with full camera control. Fully animated character/tokens interacting with M. Monoopoly. Game board has has real world structures and buildings. Original music and sound effects. Authentic names and properties from classic Monopoly game. Rules can be adjusted to conform to the variety of ~house~ rules for Monopoly.   Gameplay If you don't know how to play Monopoly then there are probably too many videogames in your life and you won't be able to appreciate M64 anyway. Too bad for you because for years families of all classes, ethnicities and faiths have enjoyed the principles of greed and financial warfare that the Monopoly board game has taught us. You and any number of players take turns rolling dice, moving tokens to ~properties~ of various values, buying and selling those properties all for the purpose of hording as much money and property that's necessary to win the game. Different families and groups came up with all kinds of ~house rules~ to facilitate the game and requirement for victory. The great thing is, many of the most popular house rules have remained intact in M64.  The customization of M64 is a very endearing feature. Many of us at IGN64 grew up with the Free Parking rule where all of the money players have to pay because of Community Chest or Chance cards goes into a kitty. That money is collected whenever some lucky soul lands on the Free Parking spot and for those of you that know, we don't have to tell you how quickly that that cash in the kitty adds up. This option can be toggled on or off in the game. The same goes for the old go-around-once-before-you-can-buy-property rule. It is in this way that you can make your game of Monopoly 64 as cutthroat or sissified as you want it to be. There are even some rules available in the game that we'd never heard of, but we're sure that there's some ultimate combination of rules and options that players can setup that'll make for some thrilling monopolizing.  The human interaction of Monopoly on the N64 isn't quite like the human interaction of Monopoly the board game. What we're saying is, trash talking is more effective when you can wave a wad  of blue, orange, white and green cash in your cousin's face than when you're holding an N64 controller. Even with a Rumble Pak it's not the same.   The humanity of the game is indeed the biggest thing about Monopoly that just cannot be included in a videogame. When playing M64, you can't jump up and down and accuse whoever's playing the banker of having sticky fingers. There's no need to hide your money in your back pocket when you go to the bathroom. Just put the controller down and go.   The good part is that the A.I. of the game makes it competitive and your Monopoly skills will have to carry you through. You can assign ~personalities~ to all computer controlled players even in multiplayer games. Cautious, Bold, Normal and Intelligent are the settings but the A.I. is going to frustrate you no matter what. Cautious is not the same as timid and you'll be ready to throttle that little iron when he doesn't want to sell you Oriental Avenue so you can build a house.  Even with the shortcomings, Monopoly 64 plays a fine game of Monopoly and can't really be asked to do much more than that.   Sound Sound elements are lacking in this game. The music gives you an uneasy feeling, the tokens make cartoony noises when they move and there's no voice of any kind anywhere in the game.   If you've ever had to ride in someone else's car and been forced to listen to whatever horrible radio station they have it set to, then you'll recognize the music in Monopoly 64. It's the kind of music that you can't quite name or define, but you know you didn't like it the last time you heard it either.  The ~sproings~ and ~boowooops~ that come with the animated tokens hopping and galloping and wheeling around the board are good for getting the attention of the kiddies, this game's target audience. If you've already gotten over your fascination with subpar sound effects from other videogames in your collection, then you're going to be frustrated by Monopoly 64.  While it may have been a bit much to expect all eleven of the game's tokens to speak, we at least want Mr. Monopoly to say something every now and then. The game's been out for over 60 years and that baldheaded man hasn't said a word except for few commercials here and there. A game on the N64 would've been the perfect time to hear him laugh at you as he tells you to go directly to jail, do not pass go and do not collect $200.  Graphics As we said, animated tokens help make this game special and Mind's Eye has given us some nice, polished, high resolution cars, wheelbarrows and even the brand new token voted for 1999, the money bag! Unfortunately there's not much else to look at in this game.  The wheels on the cannon --we don't ever remember a cannon in our home sets--, the wheelbarrow all roll and the dog and horse --with jockey this time-- all trot and gallop. There's nothing to artistic here but the physics of a little metal tokens suddenly come to life are believable. You can switch camera angles on the fly while your token is motion to get the maximum effect too.   Mr Monopoly looks pretty good too when he holds up Chance and Community Chest cards for you to read. The best animations come when a token is catapulted or otherwise sent to jail.  The animated tokens are neat at first, but they do lose their appeal after about the thirtieth time you have to watch the iron trot around the corner. Even if you get a card commanding you to move to a certain square, rather than just teleport over there, your token is going to walk, roll or waddle its way to the new location and this can be boring for all parties involved. Thankfully, you can turn off all walking animations before you lose your mind.   The stylized graphics and look to the game are interesting enough, but it can look a little strange when you get the sharp tokens sitting on a blurry lower resolution background. And this only applies to the backgrounds --usually the edge of the gameboard-- that are more than just gray and black rectangles. Monopoly 64 is a great board game to console translation but this may be an instance when I don't want a board game on my N64. The game is intended for kids, but I can't help but get the feeling that older gamers will be drawn to store shelves because of the power of the Monopoly license. Monopoly at home with family, friends, junk food and a sharp wit is always a blast. I'm convinced that Monopoly fans will not get the same experience out of the N64 game. However, we don't expect NFL Blitz to deliver the same fun as actually playing football in the park with buddies. If you're looking for a way to play a classic board game on your N64 for either yourself or some eight year old you know then you've found your N64 title. It's just too bad you can't pay for it with Monopoly money.", "date": "Jan 26, 2000"}
