This is a game of a great many disparate parts, all of them widely varying in quality, somehow stuffed together into a single, highly unwieldy package.  It's not an entirely bad game, in other words, but the good bits are like needles lost in the giant haystack of the ones that aren't so good.  Parts of this game look good, but it's not a good-looking game.  Every so often there's a bit of music or sound that catches the ear, but by no means does it have an impressive soundtrack.  There are some interesting gameplay concepts here and there, but in the end, it's not fun to play.  There's simply too much shoddy execution in between the occasional moments of quality to make Shifters anything more than a curiosity.  3DO may have a decent fantasy action game in it somewhere -- there's certainly signs of improvement in this second effort -- but we'll still have to wait a while to see if that potential is ever fulfilled.  Gameplay No more than a cursory glance is required to tell that, regardless of the less complicated title, Shifters is the lineal descendant of Warriors of Might and Magic, 3DO's last attempt at a 3D fantasy adventure on PlayStation 2.  The company's willingness to lay off the license abuse is commendable, as is the inclusion of a new central gameplay element, the ability to change from a musclebound Conan-alike into several different lycanthropic shapes.  Acquiring and developing those different forms, along with the same addictive dungeon-hacking quality Warriors possessed, is where most of the fun of Shifters lies.  There's an undeniable appeal to stomping around the hallways as a towering elephant-man, plowing through the bad guys and picking up all manner of goofy potions, scrolls, and other treasure.  At some point, however, the appeal of hacking and slashing and grabbing widgets must wear, exposing all manner of flaws in the game's design and execution.  The number of holes in the dike are so many and varied that it's hard to organize them in a coherent fashion.  Camera control is perhaps a good place to start, since it affects so many other issues.  Shifters employs a semi-automatic camera, which is to say that the player can move the view around with the right analog stick, but the CPU sticks its oar in when walls and other obstacles intervene.  This is a fine system in concept, and would work quite well if the camera control were not so terribly skittish in areas with more than a little architectural detail.  Walk in between two closely-placed objects and the camera often does a full 360 the wrong way round before deciding it's looking in the right direction, and fighting it with the analog stick during this process merely makes it last longer.  Enemy AI also shares some of those haphazard qualities.  Most of the bad guys seem to attack and defend almost at random, or indeed even notice you at random.  None of them have any kind of complex offensive or defensive strategies, and as a consequence they're all easy to dispatch in the same way -- tap, tap, tap.  The unfortunate resemblance to Gauntlet becomes evident all too quickly, with the main difference being that you have to do a great deal more running around between battles in Shifters.  The enemy behavior is also detrimental to the shape-shifting gameplay, because if no significant variation in offensive strategy is needed to defeat different enemies, what's the point in bothering with new forms?  Some of the puzzle design is fun, incorporating interaction with the environment and NPCs, but there are still odds and sods to trip over there, particularly AI problems governing the movement of computer-controlled allies.  The list could go on, but the short version is that there's not enough success here to outweigh the various failings.  Graphics  The theme of a dam full of holes springs to mind again when looking at this game as a visual package.  In between the occasional sharp texture, well-crafted visual effect, and impressive bit of architecture are long stretches of ramshackle artwork, giving the feeling that the levels were slapped together at high speed out of a lot of parts that didn't necessarily go together.    Character looks and behavior have similar problems.  Lighting is haphazard on almost every surface, and the puportedly realtime shadows cast by models and other objects flutter every which way according to the vagaries of the lighting routines.  Smooth animations take turns playing in between weirdly stiff motions that don't fit properly with the surfaces around them.  Models clip through doors and other objects all the time, and there are some particularly difficult occasions when a friendly NPC somehow hangs up in the middle of a tight passage, blocking your path.  Sound  Every so often, Shifters pulls a genuinely impressive bit of orchestral accompaniment out of its hat.  The game comes closest to the epic feel it seems to be aiming at on those occasions when the soundtrack hits a high note.  It doesn't do so anywhere near often enough, though, and the rest of the time is filled mainly with clanky and grunty sound effects you've heard many places before.  Unfortunate, because this would have been quite nice to listen to if those moments could have stretched a bit.This is one of the worst reviews I've ever written.  Strange, too, since it spent goodness knows how much time in the pipeline.  Shifters, however, is not the kind of bad game that inspires one to excoriate its failings in excruciating detail.  It's the kind of bad game that makes one wish it would just leave one alone.As I say, 3DO does have a good fantasy action game in it somewhere, because the basic design here is solid, and there are moments of quite successful execution.  The overall package is too full of holes to recommend, however, despite the improvements in this sequel.", "date": "Jul 25, 2002"}
