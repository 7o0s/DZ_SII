Between the traditional turn-based stuff, the tactics-style strategy goodness, and the action-oriented hack and slash, there were almost two-dozen RPGs for the PlayStation 2. That's a lot. Remarkably, 2005 looks like it could be even better with Suikoden IV, Xenosaga II, and Return to Arms joining Square Enix's biggest turn of the generation. After all, in a year that will see Kingdom Hearts II, Final Fantasy XII, and Dragon Quest VIII all hit the system before the end of December, you've got yourself quite a metaphorical earthquake.   But with a lineup like that, I suppose it justifies having one of those quaint little side projects just prior to your big boom. And that's exactly what Square Enix appears to have with its first game of the New Year, Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. Based on the anime of the same name that's currently running on Cartoon Network, Fullmetal Alchemist begins with a lot of promise. Taking place in a world that embraces the use of Alchemy, it follows the adventures of Edward and Alphonse Elric as they search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone. As it turns out, this search is an important one since the brothers must use its power of amplification to right all that they've done wrong.   You see, several years ago, the boys tried to use their magical powers to resurrect their dead mother but ended up making things worse instead. The oldest brother Edward lost his right arm when trying to perform the ritual, while his sibling Alphonse lost his entire body. Edward managed to confine Al's ethereal presence to a suit of old armor before he disappeared completely, but not without losing his left leg as a result. It's a pretty rough story, but with Ed now sporting a pair of mechanical prosthesis and Al always prepared to support him, the duo is willing to do whatever it takes to get back to normal again -- which includes finding the Philosopher's Stone.   The anime, which is owned in the U.S. by FUNimation, is great fun. It's extremely humorous, has terrific artwork, and boasts a lot of cool fight scenes and dialogue. Rather than retell the events of the 51-episode television series, however, the Fullmetal Alchemist videogame goes down a different path. Although it does incorporate a few elements and players from the show, it's essentially an all-new story with fresh supporting characters and locations. Despite this originality, the game is still extremely faithful to its source material and is easily the most appealing aspect of the experience. Very rarely have I played a licensed product that has actually made be want to stop what I'm doing and pop in the DVD instead, but The Broken Angel's characters are so interesting, entertaining, and funny, that it does just that. Playing the game itself, however, isn't quite as compelling.    The problem is that Fullmetal Alchemist ultimately turns out to be a poor man's Kingdom Hearts. It follows a lot of the same gameplay conventions that Disney's product offered, while stripping them of any real strategy. The idea of the partner system, for example, is used in The Broken Angel just as it was in Kingdom Hearts; but instead of being able to command multiple teammates with a variety of different scripts, you're only left to order three specific actions: Use, Follow, and Tackle. The accompanying AI for these commands isn't very good either, and your brother Alphonse doesn't always seem to react as quickly as he should. Most of the time following one of his attacks, he's commonly out of range of his original target, which makes the whole reason for using him moot.   This just goes to show that Fullmetal Alchemist doesn't really need the partner system at all. Using the same action-oriented approach as Kingdom Hearts (minus the ability to target), the game employs a similar set of combos that should be more than enough to eliminate every threat available. With the exception of a few boss characters, every opponent in the entire game is a relative pushover, and whether you're using alchemy as an assist or not, should pose no problem whatsoever. This type of dominance is made possible for two specific reasons: 1.) the AI is lethargic and barely aggressive at all, and 2.) the enemies aren't strong enough to keep up with your leveled-up enhancements anyway. When all these elements are combined together, it makes for a rather repetitive experience that's ultimately a lot shorter than a single episode of 2003's .hack -- and those games were pretty short.    But wait, there's still one last pet peeve that became really frustrating in a short amount of time: the control. Slow and plodding, Edward sloshes around the screen at a pace that's roughly half that of every other modern RPG. It feels as though he's in slow motion most of the time. To make matters even worse, his floaty jumps can often make it difficult to reach seemingly simple elevated obstacles -- and far too often, I found myself falling off things (rather than jumping off them) because of poor response times from the controller to the screen.   Fullmetal doesn't do everything wrong, though, in fact it has some pretty decent ideas -- the most obvious of which is the alchemy transformation system. Based on the idea that Edward can use his skills to transmute one item into another, the transformation in The Broken Angel are actually pretty cool. Barrels, signposts, and various knickknacks can all be reconfigured to become everything from a brand new melee weapon to a kick-ass mounted cannon that deals some major damage. Players can even metamorphose existing weapons a second time so that they become powerful versions of their former selves. And when you throw in the occasional puzzle that allows you to turn a train into a gun, or a car into a staircase, it adds some welcome novelty to the game.   Another nice touch is the fact that you have some limited real-time control over your alchemy powers. Hitting the magic button once creates a rock-based barrier that serves as defensive protection, while holding the button down to charge it produces offensive barriers of a similar design. This philosophy applies to the transformation of objects too. So while you may decide that you want to turn that trash can into a killer razor-sharp boomerang, you'll also have the option to convert it to a collection of pipe bombs or a bow and arrow. Luckily the menu system used to decide all this is appropriately fast and never takes away from the action at hand. All in all, this aspect is handled pretty well. It's just too bad that a lot of the items and weapons you can create don't have more practical uses when actually employing them.   Visually the game has some pleasant high points as well. The animated characters have transitioned nicely from 2D to 3D, with character models looking just as you'd expect them to. Moreover, the quality of FMV animation that Square Enix has used for telling the story looks fantastic and, since it was created specifically for the game, doesn't have the ~recycled movie~ feeling that a lot of the anime-based titles usually have. I still would like to have seen more details in the textures and animations of the characters and monsters, though, and the lack of variety in scenery negatively add to the repetitious nature of the experience.Normally with a game like this, I'd preface my closing comments with something like ~fans of the license will probably go nuts for it,~ but I'm really not so sure if that's the case this time. As a fan of the series myself (I can't wait until the Region 1 DVDs hit stores starting next month) and as an RPG aficionado in general, I still couldn't find a way to get into Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. And believe me, I really wanted to.Ultimately, Fullmetal Alchemist is probably best left as a rental for curious series fans and role-playing nuts waiting for Xenosaga. Given its short play time, easy challenge, and straightforward nature, The Broken Angel could definitely occupy you for a weekend or so, but I'm not so sure that you'd ever go back to it. Perhaps when sequel to Fullmetal Alchemist, which is said to fix a lot of the problems of this first game, make it to our shores sometime next year (and it probably will), it'll offer some nice surprises that this game so desperately could have used. But until then, all I can do is shrug and return to my DVD player.", "date": "Jan 7, 2005"}
