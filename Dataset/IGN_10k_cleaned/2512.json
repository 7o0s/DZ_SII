Unfortunately, it didn't go all that far.  The effort of crafting a realtime 3D game engine, a first for the series (even on the PC), took up almost all the time, meaning a tiny selection of courses and golfers.  The three-course circuit was some sort of ignominious record, save perhaps for some early Apple II and Commodore 64 golf simulations.  It was a very well-made golf game in most every other aspect, though, so all that remained was for EA to flesh out that skeleton of graphics and gameplay with a few more features.  Enter the few more features.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 features the expected tuning to its 3D engine, plus much more meat to hang on those bones.  There's now a healthy suite of seven realtime 3D 18-hole courses (six real-life, plus a ~Tiger's Dream 18~ compilation, unlocked a hole at a time), more golfers both fictional and otherwise, a complete new training and licensing mode, more extra modes to go along with the Tiger Challenge tests, and further refinement to the analog control system.  Sound like enough for one year?  Admittedly, you haven't got a choice, since the only other golf game of note on PlayStation 2 is the as-yet-unreleased Hot Shots Golf 3, which sits decidedly to the left of Tiger's realistic sim presentation.  Some may consider that an alternative, but there's probably a slice of the market at least as large that wants their golf to presented with ordinarily-proportioned heads.  Those fans should find little fault with the new Tiger Woods, though -- it's a much more solid product than last year's model, and bodes well for further improvements in 2003.  Gameplay  When you load up the game and all the mode options are grayed out, do not panic.  Tiger Woods 2002 just takes players by the hand a little, requiring the completion of a short tutorial before all the modes are available.  Some veterans might be bothered initially, but this was probably a wise design choice in view of the big picture, since the analog-only swing system is probably still unfamiliar to many.  It's a remarkably intuitive control method, though, in comparison to the traditional tap-tap-tap power meter system of yore.  Basic shots require only one finger, pulling back on the left analog stick for backswing and snapping it forward to release the power thus stored.  Hooks and slices are controlled by moving the stick a little to the right or left, the L2 button puts spin on the ball in conjunction with the D-pad, and L1 adds a bit of extra power during the backswing.  The quick-fingered can manipulate their shots with surprising precision, although it's still not that hard for beginners to shoot straight and make par.  Setting up a shot beforehand uses more traditional controls, but they're just as well-designed.  The interface provides plenty of information without cluttering up the screen, and the most important options (club and shot selection) sit on the shoulder buttons, making it easy to swap back and forth between choices and see how they affect potential distance and placement.  Those work just as well in the regular behind-the-tee view as the circle-button zoom view, although the latter is a little more exact, and includes a neat motion-blur effect as the camera moves forward to show a potential lie.  Putting seems a little bit friendlier this time out than before.  The ~caddy tip~ window offers precise measurements suggesting the power and aiming of a putt (with a cute little delay while he's reading the green), and the line indicators showing where a straight shot will go and letting you adjust accordingly.  The old geography grid from last year's model is gone, which is curious considering how well that showed off the 3D engine, but it doesn't seem to be much of a loss in gameplay terms.  There's still enough information to plan and execute putts effectively.  So the gameplay engine is solid -- but it already was.  What about everything else?  You will probably be pleased to know that the gameplay presentation has been thoroughly overhauled.  It's possible to set up a regular game, with match, stroke, or skins play, but the real attraction is the Tiger Challenge mode, a progressive series of competitions with cash rewards that unlock new courses (seven in all) and golfers.  It's much more than the set of ~license tests~ that it was last year (although 2002 does include a few training/test exercises in between competitions), and very engaging once you get used to it.  In the Challenge mode, opponents arise and make matches for set stakes.  Along with the prize money, though, bonus bucks are available for special achievements -- birdies, eagles, quickly reaching the green, and so on.  A series of special rewards adds up to something pretty big over 18 holes, providing you have the skill to rake them in, and that cash can be spent on upgrading your golfer's statistics.  Win more money and the potential rewards of victory grow bigger, with major tournaments and one-on-one matches opening up.  The single-player game, then, has plenty of meat, but there's also a snack for multiplayer games as well.  In addition to the ordinary tournament or versus play, Tiger Woods 2002 includes a split-screen ~speed golf~mode, where two players compete to rack up the most cash quickly.  Almost any achievement steals money from the opponent's bank, so skill and speed are required in equal measure, and there's a funny twitch feature added in the form of running to the ball.  No golf carts here -- you have to guide your avatar with the analog stick and hammer L1 to cover the course faster.  Graphics  Sure is a great day for golf.  Tiger Woods still looks a little rough and aliased around the edges, but there are much worse specimens of the problem on PS2, and what's contained within those boundaries looks just fine.  Texturing has improved in the past year and lighting even more so, with a brilliant sun creating realistic gradations of light and shadow depending on shade, cloud cover, and positioning.  On a related note, realtime shadows fall from the golfers at the proper angles, and their edges are a fair bit smoother than they were last year.  Camera angles including the sun are lit by bright rays and a nicely-done lens flare effect, especially on sunnier courses like Copperhead Canyon (whose bizarre canyon backdrop provides a nice change to the usual pastoral scenes).  Trees are modeled with much more bulk and variety, looking less and less like polygons arranged at odd angles to each other and more like actual foliage, and the ground ebbs and flows with realistic curves.  The most noticeable improvement in comparison to last year is the water, though, which is painted with better textures and an occasional layer of mist on top.  The only matter of modeling that still needs improvement is player faces -- the features are a little misshapen still, and some of the lighting reflects off with a plasticky sheen that breaks the illusion.  From more than a short distance, though, the animation takes up the slack and provides an extremely lifelike impression, especially in conjunction with the camera direction.  Every golver has a wide array of realistic motions and poses, and they're presented by enough camera techniques to almost perfectly mimic a TV broadcast, were it not for the fact that there aren't any spectators in the galleries (not a problem for me, though, that polite applause always sounds so cheesy).  Every so often, there are some over-the-top effects to accent a great shot -- Matrix camera rotation, motion blur, and smoking rocket-trails behind a well-hit ball -- but they aren't overused to the point where they become aggravating.  Well, maybe that's because I'm not a good enough golfer to see them so often, but I can only speak from my experience...  Sound  There's not a good deal to be said about the sound in a golf game, because everything's supposed to be quiet (ssh!).  There are some suitably mellow tunes for the menu interface, though, and the in-game effects improve the atmosphere in various subtle ways.  The wind in the trees provides an ambient backdrop, occasionally with the slightly rougher addition of waves on Pebble Beach, and the thwack of the ball is mixed neatly with the ping of a tee flying away.  Commentary is provided by David Feherty and Bill Macatee, who adhere to the conventions of the profession and keep their voices down to a pleasant level.  It's easy to turn the voices off if you don't like them, but from my perspective they're a nice touch of realism.Not a lot to dislike here, honestly, unless you have a rabid aversion to golf.  This is a very well-done golf game in the simulation mode, and one with a particularly friendly attitude towards newer players.  They'll appreciate the tutorials and intuitive gameplay, while I expect advanced players will like the more detailed options available to them.  Everyone should get a kick out of the career-oriented challenge features, and speed golf is there for multiplayer fiends.It remains only to look forward to next year, when the series should only get better -- particularly, if we're lucky, better visuals and more courses.  The partially 2D PC Tigers still do dwarf the selection of holes on tap here, even though the 3D presentation makes up for that and then some.  No point in letting what might be get in the way of what is, though,  particularly when what we have here is so good.", "date": "Feb 27, 2002"}
