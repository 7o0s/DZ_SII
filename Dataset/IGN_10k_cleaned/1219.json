There wasn't too much blood, and not necessarily too little. Then Acclaim upped the ante with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. The game was one of the first to implement the benefits of the RAM Expansion Pak, which produced some of the best visuals seen on the N64 to date. It featured an amazing soundtrack and brilliant animation by N64's standards. However, in Turok 2 we could see that the series was putting on a new face. The game thrust itself into a new world of twisted monsters and evil aliens. While the storyline made up for the drastic change in appearance, the feel of the original Turok that we all knew and loved started to fade.   Queue Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion. This new take on the N64-bred franchise couldn't be farther from its roots. But, the fact remains that it is one of the only first-person shooters to be found on the N64, and a decent one at that. So, press on and find out if this new turn in the Turok series is for you.   Facts   More than 20 levels spanning five dark and menacing environments,  including the ruins of a futuristic city, an underwater military base, and a  return to the wild jungles of the Lost Lands.  Gamers have the option of controlling two main characters while  unlocking over 25 hidden game features.  Save Anywhere and Autosave functions  Fully interactive storyline to be portrayed through the use of both  scripted in-game events and carefully detailed cinemas.  24 intricately modeled and animated weapons that are upgradable,  including the Stealth Rifle, Eviscerator, and Inferno Cannon.  More than 40 wild and ferocious enemies to stand in the way of  Turok.  Intense multiplayer action, featuring over 48 unique maps and 8  modes of play, including Blood Lust, Monkey Tag, Capture the Flag, and Color  Tag.  Fully orchestrated musical score and extensive use of digital  speech. Turok 3 supports, but will not require use of the Expansion Pak.   Story In this world the theory of creation doesn't revolve around a bang, but a scream. So many years before the inception the world there was Oblivion. This ~thing~ drifted throughout the never-ending sea of space consuming everything in its path. It invaded the bodies of the living and consumed them from the inside. In Turok 2 when Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the explosion created a power blast that triggered a chain reaction that destroyed the entire universe. This explosion tore Oblivion into shreds and nearly annihilated it.   In the wake of this devastation a new universe was created. Oblivion barely survived and now searches for a way to enter the Lost Land from this universe. The Lost Land has long been the source of Oblivion's pain and suffering, but is also the key to its rebirth. But, Oblivion must be wary for the Lost Land is also the for its destruction. The last trace of pure energy lies within the Light Burden that every member of the Turok lineage carries. For Oblivion, the only way to be reborn is to sever the Turok line, ending it forever.   Gameplay As the new Acclaim Studios (Austin) animation loads up, you know something has changed. The logo morphs into a grotesque, skinless, pulsating mass. No longer will you find the light-hearted antics of the iguana, only a prelude to the dark, twisted plot that awaits you. In the beginning of the game you keep asking yourself if you are playing a Turok game, or a new twist on Half-Life. Fortunately the control scheme leaves you feeling right at home. It has the classic Turok-style controls and the easy access weapons menu. Just hold down the A-button and you can quickly choose your weapon by pressing the control stick in the desired direction. Unfortunately, while the control system is still great, the actual movement of your character is not. It seems throughout the Turok series the fluidity in the control has faltered. You'll find yourself getting exhausted just watching the character trudge though the levels. In comparison, it feels like your lugging around a sack of rocks in Turok 3, whereas in the first Turok you were gliding around on skates.   To make matters worse, this slow pace is accompanied by an, often times, nasty framerate. So not only are you walking slowly, but the visuals are dragging along as well. Acclaim added in a wobble animation (seen via first-person camera) to make it feel like you're really walking: right foot, left foot, wobble, wobble. As true-to-life as it may be, it might annoy some users. It heightens the sticky-feet effect, and makes you question if they added it in to make the slow framerate appear normal.  Not all about the control is bad, though. Once you get used to the decidedly more slow-paced movement it's just like any other Turok game. If you're a master of the Turok-style control scheme, you'll be blasting enemies in no time. However, another problem arises in this area. Acclaim, for some reason, has opted to tone down the once stomach-turning animations. In fact, Turok 3 uses a very cartoon-style death animation. You kill an enemy, and after a quick fall to the ground a transparent ghost floats quickly away towards the sky. This seems to be Acclaim's solution to quickly get rid of those precious polygons they used in the character model. It's just a hair short of X's over their eyes, and holding daisies. Turok 3 revolves around a world just as dark as Turok 2, which makes it all the more confusing as to why there's less blood and swift death animations. In a crowded first-person shooter genre it was the one cool thing it had going for it. The game is rated M and the story line is full of terror. If the game is going to be dark, then why not be consistent about it? Frankly, we're not sure.  Taking a break from pointing out the bad parts of the game, there is much good to be found. Unlike Turok 2, the game design, levels, and gameplay have been smoothed out. The first thing you'll notice about is the ability to save at anytime. In comparison to Turok 2, this game is a dream when it comes to the layout. You can no longer live in fear of playing for 45 minutes only to end up getting whacked before you reach a save beacon. Another great addition is an auto-save. The game will usually pause when you enter a new sector in a level to save your progress. To this we say, ~Thank you Acclaim Austin!~ The level design itself is a lot like Turok 2 with a bit more focus. This time around the gameplay is highly objective-driven. You'll constantly see ~New Objective: Do this~ popping up on the screen. It makes for a much more pleasant experience because you're not wondering if you've went 15 minutes in the wrong direction. Usually if you haven't completed an objective within 5-15 minutes you're doing something wrong. The levels are still huge, though, so there's plenty of surprises and plenty to do.   Speaking of surprises, though, the game is home to some of the worst enemy placement you'll find. Your screen will start flashing red and you'll be totally baffled as to where the opposition is coming from. Even with stereo sound you'll be hard pressed to find your enemy in a timely fashion. Usually they are far away hidden in darkness or crouching behind giant sprite bushes. At least in the first Turok your enemies would pursue you, so after a few devious hits the enemy would present itself; not in Turok 3, no sir. Your enemies will take as much advantage of the darkness as they can, sniping and laughing as you die with a confused look on your face. It's one thing to make a game tough, but if you can't locate your enemy it can be downright ridiculous. The artificial intelligence (AI) has also taken a turn for the worst. Most enemies run on a track loop or just hurl themselves at you. In this regard, Turok 2 had some of the better AI for this franchise. If you can recall, enemies would hide behind structures or lurk around corners. Unfortunately, most of the opposition in Turok 3 is more annoying than it is challenging. The question is often ~How is that fair,~ as opposed to ~What did I do wrong?~   Gladly, the bosses in the game are still very cool. Just as they have been in all the Turok titles. The bosses are usually pretty fun to fight. You not only have to pummel them with your favorite weapon, but you also have to use the level to your advantage. You may have to lock them in a cage, or drop something on their head to finish them off. The downside is, you have to figure this out on your own. There really aren't any clues other than the occasional out of place (usually on the ceiling) glowing object. It turns what could be a very fun experience into something extremely frustrating. You may spend 15 minutes or even a half-hour running in circles trying to figure out how to beat the boss. Acclaim was thoughtful enough to let the ammo boxes and health respawn in the boss arenas, so if it takes you a while to figure out the puzzle, you'll at least have the health and means to last that long. The game even has a few glitches, which could send you into a never-ending rage of fury. One of the bosses dives underneath a bed of lava, and you can accidentally trap him underneath if you're not careful. If this happens, he may not resurface and you'll have to kill yourself off and try again. There are a few glitches like this that can seriously sour your experience. With that said, you may not run into any at all, and for the sake of your sanity we hope for the best.   There are also two playable characters. You must choose one after a cinema at the beginning of the game. Depending on whom you choose, you'll take different paths through the level. Danielle, Joshua Fireseed's wife, is taller and uses a grappling hook to access higher paths, while Joseph, Danielle's brother, is shorter and can crawl underneath certain areas. Joseph also uses night-vision to get through the dark underground paths. Both characters are great to play with, and there are different cut-scenes so there's some added replay value. It should take you about five hours per character to beat, making for a solid 10 hours of gameplay.   The choice of weapons in Turok 3 is a lot less innovative than we saw Turok 2. In fact, it's a step backwards for the series as many of the weapons are just rehashes of the weapons we've seen before. Each character has upgrades for their weapons. For instance, Danielle's grenade launcher upgrades to what is basically a rocket launcher, whereas Joseph's grenade launcher upgrades to a napalm cannon that shoots sticky grenades, which can be triggered manually.   Multiplayer The multiplayer is similar to that in Rage Wars, but doesn't have quite as many options like the create-a-character feature. It does have several modes of play including bloodlust, capture the flag, last stand, golden arrow (hold arrow longest), monkey tag, arsenal of war, color tag (convert the most people to your team color), and weapon master (only carry one weapon at a time). Simply put, if you liked Turok 2 multiplayer and Rage Wars you'll probably like Turok 3's multiplayer as well.   Graphics To be fair, this game is very pleasing to the eye. The character design is very cool and the levels look great on the N64. Unfortunately, the framerate can be atrocious at times. Shadow of Oblivion features three resolutions: low, high, and high letterbox. Believe it or not there is little difference between the low and high letterbox resolutions. In which case, we recommend high letterbox. As good as the game looks on the N64, Acclaim didn't make very good use of the two years since Seeds of Evil was published. In fact, Shadow of Oblivion looks worse than Seeds of Evil in some regards. In Seeds of Evil we saw some great texture design and some awesome lighting effects. At the time, they were the best you could see on the Nintendo 64. Here we are two years later, and Shadow of Oblivion has only managed to eliminate the fog that has been known to plague the Turok series. Though, instead of fog now we have a lot of draw-in and darkness to make up for it. Overall, it does look better than all the fog, though. The shady environments make room for this effect, so it works out. On the other hand, the framerate is not worth this draw distance. The first Turok made in 1996 blazes by Turok 3 in the framerate department. It's true you have an unbelievable amount of fog, but at least the framerate is tolerable. Shadow of Oblivion's sticky framerate will leave you out of breath. Even at a low resolution you'll feel like you're crawling through the levels.   The game's cinematics are also dazzling. They're chock full of facial animations and clear voice acting. They do a great job of driving the story forward and, occasionally, even frightening you. There's a couple undercooked scenes, but overall they're very nice. In fact, they are top-notch on the Nintendo 64. There's probably a good half-hour of cut-scenes that give you a chance to catch your breath. Overall, they're well used.  Sound You'll find a well-composed epic score that brilliantly captures the mood of almost every level. It's crisp, diverse, and dramatic. The sound wizards at Acclaim Austin almost fool you into thinking you have a modern day orchestra accompanying you as you play. The moody music is an eclectic mix of tribal chants, staccato strings, and techno-beats. All in all, the music in this games shines through brilliantly and we can't wait to hear what these guys do on Gamecube. The sound effects are also great, even though you'll find some sounds have been recycled from the past Turok games. Nonetheless, there are plenty of growls and gurgles to keep your ears occupied. You'll often hear a stomping up ahead; this is usually the only way you're going to get an advantage over the enemies.   The cut-scenes feature plenty of voice so you won't be bored by page after page of text. Most of it is very clear except for some of the more demented monologues. It gets a bit too distorted on occasion and it'll be a task to decipher what's going on, but its overshadowed by the majority of awesome sound in this game. You will easily forgive it.  All sound in stereo, and you don't have the option to choose mono. Again, the game sounds great so there's no need to be worried.    You can pop in your Rumble Pak which shakes when you get hit or fire your weapon. The Controller Pak is, unfortunately, required so make sure you have 16 pages and one note free before you start the game. You should be glad to know that this is 74 pages less than you needed for Turok 2. Be glad for that much.  Turok 3 definitely delivers an enjoyable experience in the first-person shooter arena, but it has finally drifted away from its roots. The original Turok was great because you were hunting dinosaurs. That is what defined it. Two generations later, however, the series has morphed into a commonplace first-person shooter. Part of the original Turok team left for other companies and Retro Studios, which is probably part of the reason the design philosophy got malformed. When all is said and done the game isn't the Turok we once knew. I'd love to see this franchise return to where it came from: the jungle. Turok 3 features a grotesque, twisted storyline, as opposed to the more toned down storyline that the original Turok had, and it almost seems like they were trying too hard to make the game fit in with other first-person shooters. Conversely, the game is one of the only first-person shooters you're going to find on the N64. If you're a fan of the genre and must satisfy your gun-wielding urge then pick the game up. However, if you're looking for a return to the series' roots you'll probably just want to rent the game. I can only say that as a fan of the first game, the thrill is gone. You have to decide what it is about the series you like: the fact that it's a first-person shooter a Nintendo system or the fact that it's a game based on Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter.", "date": "Sep 6, 2000"}
