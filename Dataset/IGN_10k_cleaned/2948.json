The same team responsible for my beloved Pilot Wings 64 cart on Nintendo 64 and masters of the racing genre, the technically savvy programmers had a reputation for skill in the videogame arena. What better company to tackle technology and the future than a studio that is already known for its own Skynet-like advancements itself?  Lucky for me I had an opportunity to go down to Paradigm's programming area in Santa Monica last spring to check out the game's progress. And though it appeared to be a very cool-looking technical demo at the time, it definitely needed some mechanical refinement. Originally slated for a mid-May release I was concerned to see how well the finished product would fare when it was completed. Once it was discovered that it would be pushed back until the middle of September for more tweaking though, I breathed a sigh of relief and remained positive that all its issues would be resolved.  Now that September is here and I have the finished version in front of me, I'm beleaguered to report that the final code isn't that different from the game I played all those months ago in Southern California-- and it should be. A sad fact behind Terminator: Dawn of Fate is that it's just like your little brother, never truly realizing its potential.   Features  Ten big levels to complete Play as three different rebel fighters as you battle for the future of mankind Storyline sets right before the events of the first Terminator Action, action, action Four-channel surround sound  Gameplay As straightforward as they come, Terminator is a bare-bones action game. Though it's possible to control three different characters within the confines of the ten impressively large levels, they're pretty much the same fighter with different skins. Alexander Stone, Catherine Luna, and everybody's favorite chrono traveler Kyle Reese (sans Michael Bien's face) are the people we refer to in question, as you must meet the challenges that each stage presents and get Kyle to the Time Displacer so that he may plant his seed and allow John Conner to be born.  The atmosphere itself is very Terminator and adds a lot to the basic premise of the game: You are humans being overrun by bigger stronger hunters and so you must kill or be killed. And while that may have been all fine and good for the popular motion pictures and the 8-bit games of yesteryear, it just doesn't cut it in this day and age. Simply running from area to area with nothing more to do other than flip a switch, set a C4 explosive, or shoot bad guys over and over again wears thin pretty quickly.  Done right it's possible to find a place in your library for such a game, but they're few and far between. With superior titles like GUNVALKYRIE and Hunter: The Reckoning out there though, a reason to pick up The Terminator is never truly validated. Sure it's an action game with lots of bullets and enemies coming at you within a constant flow, but the repetitiveness of it all should deter impatient players before they make it to the third level. When you have all these robot guys piled into one tight area with no variety or strategy to beating them, no change in how they're eliminated, limited ammunition, or no truly diverse forms of attack, what's the point of it all?  I will grant you that the stages are huge and modeled after the flicks extremely well, and that traversing the world of the Terminator is a neat task to undertake, but with a true lack of entertainment found within the gameplay model and one of the worst cameras we've seen in the genre for quite some time, the excellent atmosphere is all but overshadowed. ~What do you mean it has one of the worst camera's in the genre?~ Glad you asked!  Utilizing the same camera angles that Resident Evil and Silent Hill have been implementing for years, Dawn of Fate is designed like an adventure. With preset shots and views that change on their own, the last ounce of fun has been stripped from the game. While Resident Evil and Silent Hill involve battles that take place in close quarters with predominately slow moving enemies, The Terminator tosses you a gaggle of characters who maneuver just as quickly as you, while shooting at the same time. Imagine that scenario in the infamous second floor hallway in the original Resident Evil. Sound like fun? You're right, it isn't.  The controls react accordingly too. Discombobulating you with a traditional up, down, north, south setup on one screen before totally reversing them on you the next scene over. Press left and run to the left in the first angle and then suddenly be moving right when the camera switches while pushing the same direction -- That's pretty much the scenario you'll find when playing through all ten levels of Dawn of Fate. It works in an adventure title sure, but not here.  It's really too bad, as there are some elements of the game that I really enjoyed. Including an unmoving first-person mode that allows for a more accurate glance at the enemy and the surrounding area (which is the type of game this should have been), and the ability to hop behind gun turrets Battlefield 1942-style to mow down incoming machines. I also found the plethora of original designs for new and old terminators to be very much in the spirit of the film, and consider it a waste to see them go so unfulfilled.   Graphics Particularly of note are the movie-quality CG scenes, which are reminiscent of the Sarah Conner narratives from the previous two films. Borrowing heavily from the art design of the motion pictures, the rustic rundown look of the future is just as it was when were first introduced to it way in back in 1984. Whether its the crushed skulls littered throughout the open roads or the disheveled buildings enclosing the populated environments, Paradigm did a great job of capturing the proper atmosphere. They even included an anamorphic widescreen option for 16x9 owners like myself!  Special effects and source lighting too is top notch, and even in the most subtle of arenas make a significant impact on the world around you. A flickering orange silhouette bleeds over whatever objects surround a nearby fire and laser-based weapons emit an effective neon glow whenever they're triggered. Also cool are the air-warping heat effects that give off the impression of a true temperature change, and little decals on the wall that are left whenever a projectile hits an object. All of these features are a little bit crisper and have an extra amount of bite in the Xbox.  Despite those neat special effects and excellent direction however, the rest of the visuals fall into the wishy-washy field of vision. While the textures are highly detailed and avoid the monotony that you'd expect in a world primarily consisting of grays and browns, the character models themselves are bland in comparison with little animation and several unrealistic reactions to the surrounding area (like when walking into a wall that should stop your characters animation, only to be stuck running in place). Of course, the real deal closer is the bad camera that we mentioned earlier and its haphazard tendency to block important angles. Solid proof once again that a fixed camera could have made all the difference in the world.  Not to mention Kyle Reese, who looks like his head is about to burst.  Understandable that they couldn't get the rights to the likeness, but does that mean he can't even look human?  If I had to guess which one of my buddies was actually a machine in hiding, this Reese would be cut to pieces.  Sound Unlike a majority of movie licensed titles out there, Terminator: Dawn of Fate has managed to score the official motion picture soundtrack. Accompanied with a high quality original score woven throughout the classic tune and some kick ass effects straight from the movie, the game not only sounds like you're playing with John Conner's crew, it does so as if you were inside a movie theater.  Available in all sorts of different sound modes--evenheadphone users can clap their hands, as there's a notch for that little device in there too.  The cut scenes are in 5.1, but they don't utilize this effect properly.  You basically get sound coming at your from all five channels, but it's essentially the same sounds.  So rather than immersing you in a world, the sound field just gets louder.  In-game it's just 4-channel, and the sound there is also spread out just like the 5.1 so that it's less than what it should be.  The vocal work doesn't score quite as well as the soundtrack or sound effects, but for standard videogame fare it's about what we expected. Not great, but not terrible, the voice-overs should be more than adequate to anyone who accepts the fact that nobody from the film has made the audio cut. Terminator is, at best, a rental and if you do buy it, it will serve nicely as a doorstop in the near future.  Failing to be inventive, difficult, or interesting like Dead to Rights, Terminator is just a straight out action game.  Mindless, not particularly attractive, and looking tired right out of the box.  The game makes great use of the license as the world feels very authentic to the Terminator universe.  Everything else, however, is faulty.  The camera blows, the action isn't exciting, and the game put me to sleep faster than Nyquill.", "date": "Sep 19, 2002"}
