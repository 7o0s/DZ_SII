As the notion of merging movies and games together has come and gone so many times, exemplified in games such as Wing Commander, The Darkening, or any one of Digital Pictures' games, and with companies such as Rocket Science and full-motion FMV fading into the recent past, Universal Interactive most certainly has had its work cut out for it with The Thing.No harm meant to Universal, or rather the newly named Black Labels Games, but I felt that John Carpenter's 1982 movie remake of The Thing in game form was pretty much going to fail. At best, I suspected the team would pull off a few neat tricks here and there and that would be it, end of story. But with games such as these one simply has to sit back and wait to see what the developers finally come up with.What's surprising is the developer's -- and the publisher's -- determination to make The Thing work. The innovative squad-based fear/trust system does indeed function (for the most part), and the intense gore, foul language, and surprising scenarios of the movie manifest themselves in a very pure sense in this game, which can be described accurately as a survival-horror game, since it's packed with both true horror and it's based entirely on survival. And -- Thank God! -- it doesn't feel like a Resident Evil rip-off.BackstoryBlack Label Games' The Thing starts where the movie leaves off. For those who haven't see the movie, heres a little backstory (in brief): A team of American scientists residing in the Antarctic are unwittingly exposed to an alien creature that lives in any living organism. In this case, it's the form of a dog, which looks like a regular dog, but inside, it's a ~thing~ posing as one. The canine runs away from a Norwegian base camp, where a helicopter chases it down, but eventually it crashes and burns. The seemingly innocent hound is taken in by the Americanos. And that's when things begin to change at the American camp; dogs start to act strange and people start freaking. More to the point: both start transforming into beasts.They soon realize a chameleon-like creature is amongst themselves, and the foul-mouthed Kurt Russell decides to weed out the imposters with a blood test. Soon after come some of the grossest, bloodiest, and gooiest scenes this side of Alien, the movie really starts moving. Eventually, the team drops off one by one, and the ~thing~ manifests into a giant, bloody, pulpy tree-like creature, so the remaining two men decide to blow up the entire camp to keep wipe it out completely. That is, unless one of them is the ~thing.~ There is more, but I'll save the ending for those who haven't seen this great flick (which by the way is still very much a fun movie to watch).GameplayThough it has its fair share of problems, The Thing is a smartly designed game filled with action, a healthy dose of exploration, some puzzle solving, and plenty of ~thing~ extermination. After a healthy does of acquainting myself with the controls -- it took about an hour to get it right -- I came to see the bigger picture, and I really began loving The Thing. Unlike the fixed and awkward camera in Resident Evil, The Thing's camera shows the game from a short, third-person perspective that rigidly sticks to the player's back. In only a few rare situations does the camera switch to a fixed angle. The A button is used to shoot, B is to engage with NPCs, and X is for using items.Players take on the role of a specialist Search and Rescue leader who's been sent to uncover the mysterious deaths of the previous US team, so the game is a sequel. Players must get to grips with several dynamics at first, one of which is handling the freezing cold. It's measured like an air meter for swimming characters, with an on-screen ~freeze~ gauge. But handling this is the easy part: When it gets cold, you find a room to hide in.Managing a squad is both exhilarating and frustrating. Players control their team members using what's called the Trust/Fear system, based on the concept originated in the movie. At first, your team trusts you, and you can command it to follow, fix items, go to an area, or stay put. All this is done by using the Y button and selecting bubbles that function like the interface in Sega Sports' NFL 2K3, believe it or not. Later, they become scared or uncertain, or they freak out because of the glorious quantity of blood, guts, and gore that cover the Norwegian base's walls and floors. When the NPCs grow scared, they barf or pee their pants (yes, this happens). They talk, indicating their level of trust, dissatisfaction, or helplessness. To calm them, to show your level of humanness -- because quite quickly, every squad member starts to suspect one another -- you can perform several tasks. Handing them weaponry or ammo, shooting ~things~ in a fight, testing yourself with the hypodermic needle, these all show signs of trust.Just like in the movie, if a human is tested and he is an alien, he'll transform in front of your very eyes, his skin peeling away, blood spurting across the floor and onto the walls, and a freaky humanoid, with crab-like hands begins its happy new existence. The point is this -- you work with a team, and if you get into the game like I did, you begin to actually feel like these guys are on your side. So when they transform, it's sad, and you feel like you've lost a comrade. It really does elicit emotion in the player.Your team starts out with a soldier, a medic and an engineer. Each performs his task, the soldier is a good fighter, the medic heals you when you're injured, and the engineer fixes electrical problems when they present themselves. To be honest, the whole thing works quite well, and it's great fun experimenting with the NPCs because their AI level is quite high. They'll instantly shoot when aliens appear, they'll do things when asked, they occasionally get in the way of your line of fire, and you may peg them by accident, after which they'll say, ~Watch where you're shooting!~ and move to another location. They'll ask for ammo and more. All this is done through voice or icon help.But about a third of the way through the game your men start dropping like flies. And so here's a spoiler: Nearly every one of my men -- NPCs who took the blood test -- transformed into aliens. I lost almost all of them. In fact, nearly every single one of the men I met -- whether they were on my team or not -- turned into aliens.Is that a good thing? Well, the fact is, the Trust-Fear system works to a point, but even guys I trusted were lost. One of the game's smaller problems is that it's clear the designers had to fudge the whole blood test thing. I tested men who were with me for a good 45 minutes, and who freaked out and saved my character's ass, but they all turned on me. So yeah, I trusted them, but in the end, it didn't matter because I lost them all. Why trust anyone? Even after a blood test? That's a problem. An even bigger problem is that the test doesn't always work -- by design. For instance, I tested several NPCs who came out negative and seconds later they transformed into beasts. What's up with that? Some of this inconsistency is actually scripted into the game, and in other cases, the developers simply had to kill off an NPC to progress the story. It's incongruent with the whole notion of the blood test, and in some significant way, it cheapens the game, not to mention that it's just plain confusing.After getting to grips with the squad aspect, The Thing progressively gets better. The controls take some time to adjust to, but after you reach the peak of the learning curve, the game deepens. It's quite refreshing to play a game that takes place in Antarctica, since if the ~thing~ or your buddies don't kill you, the elements will. Given a set of tasks at the start of each level, players must cross vast stretches of snow to find a key, or locate a special bunker, or switch something on to make a door work. For instance, you might have just completed a task and you're trudging back to a warm hallway, when a throng of aliens pounces on you from out of nowhere. It's surprising and it's always fun to pick off alien scum.As the game progresses, the range of the alien's form evolves. At first, there are simply scuttlers, but soon, 7-8 foot tall creatures come raging your way. Some of the scuttlers launch green blobs of evil alien goo at you, while others swarm in huge clusters and attack like an army of dogs. Even later, a larger, more powerful thing appears, once with speed and long-range arms that can knock about a third of your health away in a single swipe. When you kill these, they sprout two to three scuttlers in their last breath, in the hopes of survival.In other levels, you'll see horse-size hounds -- they look like a cross between a pig and a dog. There are spawning mounds that birth scuttlers, and there are some rooms with a handful of tentacles, too. The constantly changing form of the thing in some small way reminds me of the creatures in Half-Life, even if the movie came first. And then there is the big momma of them all, the three-headed, tree-like ~thing~ that players confront in their first boss fight. Let me just say it here, this is probably one of the harder boss fights in the game.It's worth noting that some of the later enemy AI is quite smart (hence the ~AI~ part). One of the battle strategies is to whittle away an enemy's health, and then to light them on fire. Some of the bigger runners (I'll call them ~swipers~ for consistency's sake) are smart. They dislike fire, so if you lay down a wall of it, they'll back off, and try going around another way! It's not rocket science to be sure, but they wait for the fire to go out, or they sneak around and pummel you from behind. And when there are two to fend off, you must rely on new and different strategies, which gives players more than one way to kill the creatures.One of the coolest, albeit less significant, aspects of the game is the ability to use video cameras. In various stages of the game, players use computers to read backstory, read files for keys, etc., access tape recorders to save (by the way, the save points are all excellently spaced apart), and use cameras. You can look left, right, up or down using left analog stick button, but you can also zoom in on objects using the right analog stick button, and in some cases, you can read important maps or postings on walls. It's quite a cool trick.The Thing is engaging all the way through, and its combination of elements, from the squad-based AI to the excellent pacing to the level design -- mixing outdoor and indoor environments -- add up to one memorable experience; and rarely does it feel like it betrays the film's universe of rules. There are some minor complaints, however, one of which I've already mentioned (the blood test inconsistency). The camera is decent but not great; it's stuck like a panhandle to your player's back, and oftentimes that's irritating because it's so rigid. The close nature of the camera makes it hard to see things nearby, especially if they're near your feet, such as patches of fire or scuttlers. I don't know how many times I walked into a patch of fire that I thought was far enough away from or when I couldn't see a creature nibbling on my shins. The control system takes some getting used to also, as does the NPC Trust/Fear system. After some time and experimentation, it does indeed work.I have a couple of wish list items: I wish there were more backstory elements; yes, there are some, but not quite as much as I had hoped. A few maps would have come in handy. Not that I really needed them to be honest, but somehow I have come accustomed to having them. There are several very dark areas that I simply could not see into no matter how much I lightened my TV. Is that a good thing? (The answer is no.) And, the alien animations are horrible. They're so funny in some cases that I laughed. A few more animations would have realy helped here guys. But that's a graphics topic...GraphicsWhat's interesting about The Thing is its use of texture and design. It's not the best looking game on the market, but it does well with what it has. The character models are sturdily built and the textures on them are respectable. The face textures are better than decent, although character heads are still a little blocky. The alien creatures, in all of the various forms, are everything I had hoped for and more: Several times I was thoroughly grossed out, surprised or even excited by the newest variation on the ~thing~ theme. The alien design doesn't disappoint, even if the animations are often comical.The backgrounds are for the most part ordinary. But a couple of areas stand out with spectacular results: The outside environments -- the gusty wind storms, the drifting snow, the footsteps in the snow -- all helped to imprint a strong sense of the freezing Antarctic. You know when you walk out that door it's going to be cold, and through great visuals and excellent sound effects, the effects click.Then there is the blood. This game is gory, chunky, splattered with body parts, and disturbingly gross. Headless bodies slump in the corners of pool halls; human forms sliced in twain lie at the ends of trails of deep red blood; the floors and walls are painted with swathes of blood; exploded bodies line the kitchens, the hallways, the medical rooms. One bathroom scene is unbelievably deep crimson red and chunky. You get the picture? There are scenes of explicit gore and violence (as the Resident Evil games always read), and in The Thing, the gore is bountiful. It's beautifully foul stuff, and it's perfect for this game. (Remember, the movie was a wretchedly gross endeavor all on its own.) SoundFirst, the voice acting: There is a lot of it, and for the most part, it's invigorating to hear your own NPCs talking to you and to one another. There are numerous cutscenes, too, though most of them feature the attack of an army of scuttlers, which screech and squeal like evil alien babies. The larger ~thing~ creatures can be heard moaning and roaring in nearby rooms which helps to create an excellent sense of dread, and the combination of the high pitched scuttlers and the larger, deeper moans of the other ~things~ brings a good variety to the alien chorus.The lead character sounds a little bit like a cross between Solid Snake and Gabe Logan. He's tough but cool. And the music is strangely very much in the background. It turns out that's a gift, because as they say, silence is golden, and in a survival horror game it creates excellent tension, anticipation and fright.The Thing takes some time to get into, and it may be a little frustrating for some gamers. But I'm quite sure that once its given a chance, The Thing won't disappoint. The deeper you play, the more satisfying and challenging it becomes, and the more it draws you in. The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels, and it pulls off one the most innovative and best squad-based play on a console to date. I can't wait to see what they do with the sequel (just a guess, of course...). And, The Thing is not designed for an innocent little kid. It's an M-rated game and to prove it, it's filled with grotesque scenes of violence, exploding bodies, and gallons of blood. Also, there's foul language, too, something that's more common these days in videogames. All of things are consistent with the movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money. It's a good action-adventure game, and yes, it's even a very good survival-horror game, something we'll all in need of.", "date": "Aug 29, 2002"}
