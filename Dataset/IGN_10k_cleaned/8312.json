Its pick-up-and-play style of gaming focus and its touch screen mimicking mouse input really makes that carry-over possible. This year alone we'll be seeing several viral web-based PC games like Line Rider, Diner Dash, and Cake Mania hit the Nintendo DS, and it's not surprising that Electronic Arts and its Pogo.com property are making that leap from web to DS. There are a lot of clever and fun, if just a little unoriginal, games to play across the Pogo.com network, so it definitely sounds like a winner to get that experience on the Nintendo DS. Unfortunately, it's a little light on features and variety, and while a handful of games still retain that casual pick-up-and-play charm, this compilation feels a little hollow with a sloppy presentation and very few options.   Pogo.com games are all about the casual experience. These games are simple, point-and-click games with cute and colorful visual styles, with designs that have either been created from original concepts or derived from more classic ideas. Most of the games on Pogo.com aren't very deep but they're addictive enough for thousands of players to keep returning to the site in order to get their fix. It doesn't hurt that playing the games have the added incentive of earning tokens which can be turned in for extra chances within their daily, weekly, and monthly drawings for prizes.   With dozens of games already in the Pogo.com library, it certainly makes a whole lot of sense to take that experience and send it on the road for handheld gamers, and that's exactly what Pogo Island for the Nintendo DS sets out to do. What you get in Pogo Island are five of the more popular games from the website: Poppit, a puzzle game featuring stacks of colored balloons to burst and rearrange; Tri-Peaks Solitaire, a single-player card challenge where you have to remove cards in numeric sequence; Word Whomp, a Boggle-style ~how many words can you form with these letters~ mix-up jumble; Squelchies, a strange colored-tile puzzle game featuring fish and crabs; and Phlinx, a Bust-a-Move clone that doesn't try to hide its origins.   You may think that five casual games doesn't seem like a whole lot for a compilation. And honestly, you'd be right. The developers of Pogo Island make the attempt to extend these five games by spreading them out over a board game called ~Island Adventure,~ and scatter silly touch-screen challenges like ~nut sorting~ and ~object catapulting~ mini-games, but the presentation's also artificially inflated by requiring players to repeat play many games simply because they didn't earn enough points to continue in the first try.   Granted, the games should stand on their own without the need for this board game middleman, and in the occasional case, like Tri-Peaks Solitaire, there's some replay value here just in gameplay alone. But there are very few options to shake up the variety...these games are what they are, and nothing will change. The designers try to infuse a bit more into the design by requiring a certain quota, like dropping a specific number of tiles in Phlinx or getting a set combo string going in Poppit. But even with these targets to shoot for, and reward tokens to earn by reaching those marks, the game feels just a little too empty for a full-priced Nintendo DS game.     Pogo Island also has the feeling of a first-generation production. There are visual, graphical glitches in places there shouldn't be, and some surprising slowdown and sloppy collision detection in others. The touch-screen spinner even shows an obvious bug that slipped through, where a quick flick will confuse the interface by sending the spinner rotating in the completely opposite direction.   However, all isn't lost.  For those who use Pogo.com, EA added a pretty cool ability to upload earned tokens from within the adventure to your account using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. This function links the DS game with the Web-based network in a limited fashion, but if you're always on Pogo.com trying to earn tokens to enter their weekly cash drawings, this is a nice way to bulk up your odds of winning the prize money. The tokens you earn within the adventure don't do anything else, so you might as well hop online and set up an account so you can spend what you collect.   But in terms of multiplayer options, you don't get much -- there's a hot seat mode for multiple players to share and pass around a system playing each game competitively one at a time. There is a wireless mode, but it's only to send a demo version of Poppit to cartridge free systems...most likely a bonus in order to get a spot in Nintendo's Download Demo kiosks at Toys 'r Us.The casual games in Pogo Island are good for a few minutes play, but they don't have enough of that addictive quality to stand by themselves. Five in a pack is a decent start but it's clearly not enough because I was really looking to get more out of this compilation. Yes, the addition of the Pogo.com link to move your earned tokens is a pretty nice encouragement to keep playing, but I'd love to get a few more games in here to spice up the variety.", "date": "Mar 31, 2007"}
