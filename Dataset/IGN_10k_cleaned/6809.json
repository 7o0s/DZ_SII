Links has been the acknowledged master for some time, as one of the first to offer up photo realistic graphics, an advanced stats system and loads of licensed golf courses. Equally important has been the Jack Nicklaus series that gives avid golfers a chance to design their own courses or download some of the many available on the web. Still, in the end, what really matters is how fun and to some degree how easy the games are to play. In their latest rev of Microsoft Golf, the Evil Empire has shown that a game doesn't have to be complex or feature laden in order to be entertaining.  Let's start with the looks. Much like Links, Microsoft Golf 1999 delivers crisp course detail with photo animations of the players and photo stills of all the objects in the game. Unfortunately, these objects still suffer from that curse of nearly all PC golf games, the cardboard cutout syndrome. Be that as it may, the rest of the game looks fantastic with smooth ball movement and fly-by animation as well as sharp sand and grass layouts. The only problem here is that, while Microsoft has done a fantastic job of making their game look as nice as other titles on the market, they haven't done anything to make it better, a statement that is true of nearly every aspect of this title.  Take the game options themselves. Golf 1999 gives you the ability to set up a game for Stroke, Match, Skins, Scramble (basically a version of Match where you hit from the best team ball) and Bingo Bango Bongo (a stroke game that lets you bet on nearly everything). All of these options are available in other games either currently on the market or ones coming down the pipe shortly. The game's putting mechanisms are exactly the same as those of the rest of the game which is a convention of other golfing titles that I've truly come to hate (you don't swing a putter like you swing other clubs in real life, why would you want to do it that way in a simulation?). Equally, all of the helpful tools and rules in the game, dealing with wind, lie of the ball, and clubs are all pretty much standard issue. The one exception is the game's swing type menu. Here players are able to select one of four different ways to strike the ball  the standard 2-click or 3-click swings, the Sim swing (which I found to be nearly useless in its complexity) and the Natural swing, a Microsoft addition that, once I got used to it, proved to be very cool indeed. Still, one new play method is not it and of itself enough to make this game stand out from others on the shelf.  The course selection is excellent and offers player many holes that they may have not played before instead of crushing to show the same three courses that everyone and their brother tries to get a license for (if I have to play Pebble Beach one more time...). Those included are Donald Ross Memorial in Harbor Springs Michigan, The Links and Teeth of the Dog from Casa de Campo, The Bay Harbor Golf Club in Bay Harbor Michigan, Eagle Heights (my personal favorite), a fantasy course, and Medalist in Hobe Sound, Florida ( a very difficult course that was actually designed by Greg Norman). Also included is a nine-hole course, the Preserve 9, which is also in Bay Harbor, Michigan. That last one is a bit misleading when you look at the front of the box which proudly displays ~includes 7 beautifully designed course.~ Maybe it does, but it only includes 117 holes rather than a full 126. Surprisingly, I liked every course included in the game and spent quite a while exploring the intricacies of each.  Which brings us to the final verdict. Even though Microsoft Golf 1999 doesn't have many of the big features that other titles have (which is why its score is much lower), it is a lot of fun to play. The blend of its excellent courses, pleasing soundtrack and voice-overs, easy to use menus and selectable play interface works out very well and will no doubt keep computer golf fans, both novice and advanced entertained for hours to come. An excellent choice for those looking for a quick and easy golf game without all the frills.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 22, 1999"}
