The idea was that the game would appeal to both fans of skiing and snowboarding. To compete with Nintendo's brilliant 1080 Snowboarding, Imagineer must have felt offering the best of both worlds was the way to go. Well it wasn't such a bad idea in 1998, but the year is now 2000. The Nintendo 64 is fading away slowly and systems like Gamecube, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, and Xbox are on the forefront of our minds. Can a game that was mediocre when it was released two years ago compete in the present American market?  Features   Three game modes including Championship, Time Attack and Two Player Battle Three courses including Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom The game features licensed gear from Solomon, Bonfire and ON-YO-NE Six different characters to choose from with unique looks and attributes Different snowboard and ski models to choose from Collisions and crashes affect racing abilities Gain experience and level-up Various air tricks for both skis and snowboards 15 background music settings Various shortcuts and alternate routes on different courses Rumble Pak compatible   Gameplay The first thing that jumps out at you is the fact that you can choose to ski or snowboard on the ~big mountains~ of the game. Realistically, it's one of the few things the game has going for it. You start off by choosing one of three modes: Championship, 2P Battle, and Time Attack.  Championship mode is the most appealing of the three as it lets you take to the slopes under three different premises. The first is Free Ride mode. Basically this is the free-for-all mode and the end objective is to make it to the goal line in first place. The other two racing modes are Slalom and Giant Slalom. To get a first place in Slalom you're going to have to pass through a series of gates marked with red flags. It's pretty much the standard in every snow-themed game, as it's the one thing they can add in which requires more skill than just dodging trees. With each gate you pass you'll earn more time allowance to make it down the hill. As for Giant Slalom, it's merely a more intense version of regular Slalom mode. The challenge is increased because the gates are placed farther apart. With that said, you're going to need to avoid crashing and stay focused to maintain accuracy.   One of the downsides of the gameplay is the character AI seems to be bent on destroying your chances of making it down the hill without falling. This snow-side racer features a stamina meter that determines your ability to accelerate down the hill. If you're stamina meter runs out, you'll find yourself better off skiing on sandpaper. Your meter will fall as you collide with trees and/or people. Going back to the issue of the kamikaze AI racers, you'll have to keep an eye on the colored arrows at the bottom of your screen that denote there's a crazed racer blazing a path behind you. IGN64 has found that even if you manage to avoid hitting trees you have a pretty good chance of getting knocked down by other racers.    You'll have your choice of six playable characters whose skills are rated on speed, cornering, damage, and acceleration. The characters are decidedly cool looking, each with his or her own unique attitude. The menu also displays their ratings for both skiing and snowboarding. The reason for this is you can gain experience by earning ~cool~ points while doling out tricks during your mountainside rendezvous.  Depending on if you're a skier or a boarder at the time you'll increase your character's skill rating. Naturally if you constantly ski Hans he'll be a much better skier than he would be a snowboarder. This is all saved to your memory pak and reflected in your ratings. After ganing certain amounts of experience you'll increase your overall rating from amateur to semi-pro, and eventually pro.  After you finalize your character you choose between skiing and boarding, and then pick out some equipment for yourself. For starters you can choose between a set of six different skis or boards which vary in their speed and cornering capabilities. Of course, what's a cool mountaineer without the stylish clothes? There are also six different types of clothes, which only differ in color initially. When you become a semi-pro you'll unlock better types of wear which reduce damage (to stamina) as well as wind resistance, thus improving your acceleration.    When you finally make all your choices and get ready to do some riding, the snowbound title lets you choose from four different courses. You can only play three of them in the beginning. So you'll have to gain some experience and master the first three stages in Free Ride, Slalom, and Giant Slalom to have a chance at the fourth track.   The game itself handles decently, but is fairly limited. You take sharper turns by edging with your A-button and can jump into the air using the B-button. Jumping is only effective over tall ledges, and it's only usefulness is pulling off stunts. Yes, that's right, this game does feature stunts. But, don't get too excited, there are no half-pipes or giant jumps to rip out some gnarly tricks on. You can only do a set of eight or so tricks on your skis or your board, and doing so will prove quite tasking. Big Mountain 2000 is centered on steering your player down the hill as opposed to doing stunts. There are only several high-ledges in each level and you'll have to be prepared if you want to successfully pull off a trick. Again, though, the point of the game is to get to the finish line the fastest, no land stunts. They do play an integral part in the game, though, as this is how you earn your ~cool~ points, thus increasing your skill level.  Last but not least the multiplayer mode - two-player battle - does not support CPU ~bots~ or anything of the like. You'll have to gather up a friend, and when you do it's a relatively bland race down the hill. When you choose your character you'll be able to load data from your memory pak if you happen to have one with experience. Otherwise, if another player happens to outmatch the other you can set the character to semi-pro or pro level if you wish. The mode, essentially, is like placing your friend next to you in a normal race. You'll be able to play the same three (or four) levels in Free Ride, Slalom, or Giant Slalom modes. Again, the object in each is to pass checkpoints and make it to the bottom the quickest. A four-player mode would certainly have increased the fun greatly, as the track can seem pretty barren if you get ahead or behind your opponent at all. Fortunately the framerates don't sputter too much in multiplayer mode, which is always a good thing.  Graphics Think 1998...and now think 1996. The game is essentially a very first-generation in looks. In fact, compared to Nintendo's own first-generation 1080 Snowboarding it doesn't hold up. That's two years after the original release of 1080. Sadly, though, even though the game has come stateside two years later than 1080, it was originally released in Japan after 1080 was. So, comparably, Big Mountain 2000 fails miserably in the graphics department. It doesn't look as horrific as some games we've seen, but the engine is seriously outdated to be used in the year 2000, and it doesn't even take advantage of the RAM expansion pak. The textures are stretched over the face of blocky polygonal landscapes and even though popup isn't a huge issue when it does happen it can be nasty. You'll occasionally see hillsides popping in as you turn a corner. On the bright side, Imagineer managed to give the game a little flare by making use of colored snow textures that give off the effect that they're falling under a sunset or shadows. In the end, though, there's nothing to gawk at here.   Sound The sound is the usual over-compressed N64 MIDI music. There are about 15 unique music tracks, and while they're not fantastically composed they're not horrible either. They could have been just as easily composed on the SNES as they were on N64. With that said, don't expect anything overwhelming. The music is basically just ~there.~ There are some voices and decent sound effects added in, though. When you're on the main part of the track it sounds smooth as your skis scratch over the top of the packed snow, and if you wander off the track onto the heavy snow you'll quickly hear the awkward sounds of puffy snow squishing under your skis. Throughout the race a narrator will also egg you on to keep the pace. However, any football game would dwarf the short commentary in this game. Again, the sound effects aren't horrible or amazing, they're just ~there.~I was very disappointed when we got the game in the office. It's another sad case of too little too late, which we're seeing is becoming the trend in the latest batch of N64 games. We were spoiled by 1080 Snowboarding and the unique Snowboard Kids two years ago. Had Big Mountain 2000 come out then it still wouldn't have competed all that well, but it would have had a chance. After all it offers both skiing and snowboarding, and that's the one thing the title has going for it. Still, the title should have been brought to American shores a few years ago when it had a chance. However, considering the current lack of mountainside titles on the N64 you may want to pick this one up for a rental. We definitely don't recommend buying it unless you crave snow passionately. Big Mountain 2000 could have been a great deal better if it focused on pulling tricks and gathering points. At least that would give it some replay value. Instead you're forced to cope with the fact that there's only four tracks to play on. The end judgement: rent before you buy.", "date": "Oct 10, 2000"}
