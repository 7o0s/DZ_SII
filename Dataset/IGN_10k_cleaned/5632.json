It aimed X Games at realism and TV likeness. The development team worked with current professionals across the world in carving a different kind of game from the snow-ploughed snowboarding genre, packing in loads of moves, and getting great licenses. Nonetheless, the game falls short in a number of departments that will make gamers question whether to rent or own it.   The one- to two-player X Games Pro Boarder is a snow-packed stunt monster. In the Professional mode, gamers can get to grips with as many as 2,000 plus moves, a truly awesome quantity. Radical went to town in with licenses, nabbing X Games and ESPN, thus filling the game with banner-laden and TV lookalike backgrounds. The game also mimics the X Games events and ~radical~ feel, with the graphic representations of eight currently hot boarding pros.   The all-star lineup spotlights Morgan LaFonte (with tank top and left-arm tattoo), Jamie Lynn, Shannon Dunn, Terje Haakonsen, Daniel Franck (con mohawk), Peter Line, Tina Basich, and Todd Richards. Each is brought to life with his or her characteristic clothing, mood, and their custom moves.   The game also varies the type of runs, races, and events to broaden the rather static snowboarding downhill status quo. Created with eight different events, including slalom, half pipe, night time down hill, free style, head-to-head, and stadium events (among others), the levels are generally more alive with obstacles and short-cuts than is initially apparent. Alternate routes are everywhere, and small and enormous jump spots dot the courses for those aggro racers not satisfied with mere downhill fodder.   Well, you might say, that sounds pretty good. What could be possibly wrong with it? The game suffers from a few aspects that have plagued other snow boarders.   First, with a game that rests so heavily on its massive move list, one would expect those moves to be relatively easy to pull off. After all, most of us aren't pro snowboarders, and we want the illusion of being as ~rad~ or ~phat~ as the best. (Dude.) So the control scheme should reflect exotic moves that are pulled off rather easily. In X Games that's not the case. It's awkward at times, annoying in others. Gamers must press a prep button, an interesting idea, to ready their next move, and then punch in their move. That takes practice, but even when you get it down, it's annoying. Why have a prep button at all? So what if the pro's do it? Why can't I just go straight into my tail-grab triple flip, mute air, indie, nose-bone, fer christ's sake?   OK, so maybe you can get over that one. Maybe. But the response time on these moves isn't always consistent, and that has to do with good, healthy frame rates and slick programming, of which this game has only moderate amounts. You'll notice odd camera angles at times, and a mixed sense of speed, to boot.   Another minor quibble is the game's choppy animation. Your camera angle is shaky, which adds to the less than fluid flow of moves and carves you pull off in each race or event. And compared to all three Cool Boarders, X Games doesn't knock any of those out graphically. While X Boarders executes shadows nicely and gives gamers a diversity of different looking courses, so much of the detail simply drops out. For instance, your characters look like generic Ken and Barbie boarders, not the real-life athletes they represent. Other than their slightly distinctive clothing, their racing characteristics don't appear to distinguish them in most races (other than stunt events) at all. What happened to weight, height, etc as distinguishing aspects?   OK, but can you pull off unlimited moves in the half-pipe, mon? Yes, yes, yes. When it comes to snowboarding, the half-pipe ends up as the locale especial, and we've vied for hours in this particular section. Aside from some control problems, X Games manages to execute some generic moves better than other games. Flips, somersaults, spins, and moves like tail grabs and whatnot are easy to pull off once you've mastered the dreaded prep button. You simply push in that direction you want and watch in some cases.   Musically, the game is a down-the-middle alternative collection of real bands. Sound like an oxymoron? It's a great palette of what is heard on Live 105 here in Northern California (105.3 FM). What was once ~alternative~ is no more, but X Games has it, from the Foo Fighters to Penny Wise to Rancid. It's appropriate because it's fast and popular, but it's middle of the road stuff. Thank God it's not just a bunch of fast, awful ska music.   Also, the music production is poor. The songs sound convoluted and muffled, like they're coming through a small radio, rather than straight from a CD.  In a weird turn of events, X Games Pro Boarders supports both the analog control and dual shock effects, but in many ways, the digital is more manageable, at least in the trick department.   In the end, the makers of X Games Pro Boarders should be congratulated for bringing videogame snow boarding one step further into the real world. X Games delivers in the move department. Few games can boast the amount of sheer vertical air that this game offers in the half-pipe section, as well as its vast library of moves. But X Games is not without its problems; the choppy animation and inconsistent control will linger in mind far longer than need be.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Nov 12, 1998"}
