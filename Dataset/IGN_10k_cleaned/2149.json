If you're familiar with the standard run-and-jump platformers and Final Fight-style brawler combat, you'll notice that this game offers a decent balance between the two. Features More than 36 levels More than 32 enemies Battery Save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Lady Sia's had it up to here with the approaching menace advancing through the land, capturing and enslaving the inhabitance -- she wants to put a stop to it all by forming an army and driving back the beasts who threaten the allied civilizations of the world. Unfortunately, as she leaves to get together her soldiers, she's thumped on the noggin and thrown into a dungeon without her possessions.  After being set free by a mysterious friend, she needs to get back her sword and magical ring, all the while fighting the bad guys that have already taken over the land.  The game is laid out in standard platform form, but the design emphasizes hand-to-hand combat and magical abilities along with its run-and-jump action .Sia surprisingly can't hop on enemies heads like other platform heroes...instead, she must use her sword skills to slash her way through the game's levels. In a way, the gameplay is like Mega Man-meets-Golden Axe, and you must be able to maneuver along the tricky platforms as well as master the sword combinations to slash your way through this lengthy game. To mix up the action, the developers threw in a few switch puzzles to solve so it's not a simple left-to-right scrolling romp. And it's this structured gameplay that makes Lady Sia's challenge feel decently progressive, since you don't have all of her abilities from the get-go...it's all about earning them throughout the game's worlds. Lady Sia features an excellent hand-drawn look for its characters and backgrounds, which work most of the time...but it's sometimes difficult to know which platforms are merely scenery and which are  functional ledges to stand on. The developers did put a lot of the Game Boy Advance's hardware capabilities to use -- some platforms swing back and forth and wind-blown fans spin quickly around through the use of the GBA's sprite rotation functions. Solid and transparent backgrounds scroll at different rates, thanks to the handheld's multiple-layer abilities. It's a very pretty game   If anything, it's the loose and somewhat unfair gameplay that hurts Lady Sia the most. For example, Sia's sword combos will slide the character sprite forward, which will actually cause her to fall off the edge if she gets too close. And getting to a continue checkpoint will record Sia's health as well, so when you die and start back at the checkpoint, you're left with the same amount of health you had when you activated the point -- so, in other words, if you activated the checkpoint with very little health (especially in a particularly tricky location), you're pretty screwed. Luckily there are unlimited continues, so it's not that much of a chore to start the level over from scratch after losing all the lives in storage. And the game's presentation could have used a little more energy overall -- defeating bosses, for example, is very anti-climactic.  TDK Mediactive's first Game Boy Advance game is a lengthy challenge and a fun overall adventure that has a decent balance of platform design and brawler-style combat. It admittedly feels a bit unbalanced in a handful of places, but overall it's a well laid-out package. Don't let the unfamiliar chick on the box scare you away from a this GBA title...Lady Sia's a good one.", "date": "Oct 4, 2001"}
