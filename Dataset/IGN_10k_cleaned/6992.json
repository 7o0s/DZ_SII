Can you believe it? It's been a decade of massive robots pummeling each other to the explosive death and in many ways not much has changed. Sure, fans will be treated with some upgrades, but this is still a definite niche title. The hardcore will be rewarded with more of what they've come to expect and others will remain baffled as to what the hullabaloo is all about.   In this ravaged future different groups are vying for world power and the various armored core fighters are choosing sides in a series of battles that take place over the course of 24 hours. As a free agent, the player gets to choose who to take missions from. Of course, these decisions can change the path that the player takes, leading up to a half-dozen possible endings. More important than the finale, each path also has a different degree of difficulty.    What a lot of the levels don't have is a solid degree of intrigue or depth with many missions being a little too straightforward. There are plenty of difficult sessions to wade through, but a lot of this comes from the one-on-one battles. These are a little hairier than before since the speed has been upgraded and overheating is less of an issue this time around. This makes for more of an arcade feel and a larger dependence on your hand-eye coordination than before.   Those who are familiar with the series should be able to jump right in, but the developers didn't care too much about beginners. In fact, the hidden message in Last Raven is that this game is for fans and nobody else. There's no tutorial to get your feet wet and learn what to do. There is just a one or two paragraph description of what most of the different elements are in the menu system and a testing area where players can try out their Cores against bots in an arena. You can knock yourself out with that but it's not going to help at all. Some in-depth online research will be absolutely mandatory for the new folks.    Even if the lack of a tutorial doesn't bother you, the classic gameplay element of building an AC from several different pieces that are bought and tweaked between missions is true to form and just a little more fun than building a ripping Excel spreadsheet. Before every battle it's recommended that players take into consideration the particular enemy that will be fought and adjust the components accordingly. With the ability to change the settings of the different items repeatedly this is a gearhead paradise.    Thankfully, the developers have included the ability to host five different ACs in the garage. These aren't different ACs, just different arrangements of the pieces so there can be a close-combat setup for ground units or maybe some sniper rifles and a different targeting system for air units. Again, this is pretty daunting for beginners, but familiar ground for those who have been here before.   While there have been changes under the hood, the graphics haven't seen a change. The engine here is similar to what's been seen before with Nine Breaker or Nexus. The HUD also makes a return and can be adjusted for the amount of detail on the screen. There can be the basic info or the full-on MSN info-porn cluster of green bits of data taking up each side of the screen. What hasn't been changed is that it's still possible to lose track of what's being targeted when the AC itself gets in the way. A transparency option would have been appreciated.    Fans will be happy to see some of the battle and garage tweaks that make positive changes in the gameplay, but the uninteresting missions will dampen any excitement. Sadly, those who want to check this out for the first time are getting the tiny end of the stick. Too much time will be spent researching and banging your head against the wall with a ridiculous amount of trial and error for a treat that's not nearly worth the effort.", "date": "Jun 14, 2006"}
