Oh, it's a hard life. So then, thanks a bunch Nintendo - 42 All-Time Classics is just what we want. You see, there's not one but, you know, forty-two games here - we're going to be hear till bloody teatime with this one.   In case you're still slightly oblivious to the exact nature of Nintendo's new DS package, it's a collection of traditional amusements ranging from card games to board games - all falling under the admittedly slightly subjective banner of ~all-time classics~. The hook here, of course, is portability - the equivalent real-life apparatus you'd need if you wanted to take this lot on the train would probably require half a dozen hired hands to carry, and a suitcase the size of a bungalow.    Split into eight categories - basic card games, intermediate card games, advanced card games, basic board games, advanced board games, variety games, action games and single-player games - every activity is about as close to its real-life counterpart as you could reasonably hope, each being fully touch-screen driven for minimal faff. To give you a flavour of the various offerings, without listing every single game, you'll find everything from simple card games like Memory and Old Maid to more complex affairs like Blackjack and Rummy. Board games are your generic (rather than licensed) affairs, ranging from Checkers, Connect Five and Grid Attack (basically, Battleships) to Backgammon and Ludo. Throw in a Hang-man clone, Dominoes, Bowling, Darts, Billiards, a Buckaroo-like balancing game and some simple puzzlers and the variety here really is impressive.   Even better, each game features a whole bunch of options which can be tweaked within an inch of their lives, creating even more possibilities for play and, best of all, every single title in the line-up offers a pretty damn good recreation of their real-life counterparts. Of course, the majority of these games are designed for more than one player and Nintendo pretty much has its bases covered here. For those reclusive moments, you can tackle each game against AI - battling against the computer proving a surprisingly entertaining endeavour, thanks to the variety of game modes available. While Free Play let's you hop in for a quick game of your choice, Stamp mode tasks you with taking on all 42 games in a row. To proceed to the next one, you need to collect three stamps - the full amount being awarded for a win, two for second place and one for third or below. Effectively, Stamp mode acts as a crash course in all the games available - by the time you've reached the end, you'll have played enough of each to at least feel vaguely proficient. Mission mode, on the other hand, sets you various criteria to fulfil in each game - say, scoring three strikes in a row in Bowling - and serves to unlock new goodies like avatars and even new games.     Admittedly, this latter point is a bit of a contentious issue for us. It's going to take a good couple of hours before you've started unlocking some of the cooler offerings - Ludo springing to mind most immediately - which, as far as we're concerned, sort of goes against the whole pick-up-and-play mentality of the package. Of course, it does mean that solo players have something to work toward, but we suspect that's of little recompense for your average casual gamer.   Thankfully though, Nintendo's come up trumps with its multiplayer muscle and there's a wealth of options available for communal play. Not only can eight players gather round for some hardcore classic action with a single cart, there's also online play via Nintendo's Wi-fi Connection service for up to eight, slightly more dispersed, gamers. Even better, recognising that social interaction is one of the key factors in the success of these kinds of games, Nintendo has slung various communication tools into the mix. Using ad hoc wi-fi, you can use the Pictochat-style interface to doodle knobs and send them to your friends in between turns (although, curiously, there's no keyboard-style input) and the same also applies to anyone on your friend list during online play. Admittedly, you'll find communications are limited to a selection of pre-written phrases if you're playing against a stranger - ~Hello~, ~Thanks!~ and so on - but at least it means Auntie Doris won't get an eyeful of ~I'm gonna cut you, bitch!~ when she Blackjacks her faceless teenage opponent into oblivion.    If we had to start picking nits over what's an unquestionably well-rounded package, it's the varying success of some of the real-life to touch-screen game translations. While card and board games are brilliantly executed (although it would take some monumental effort to muck something that simple up), offerings like Bowling, Darts and Billiards suffer slightly, thanks to their controls. It's not that they're not playable - you'll quickly pick up the nuances of each - it's just that the touch-screen doesn't necessarily recreate the fineries of physical sport in entirely intuitive ways. On top of that, the presentation throughout the package is functional at best - put it this way, your eyes and ears won't be agape at the audio/visual aspects of the game. Finally, with such variety on offer, there's bound to be some games that grab you more than others - meaning that while some players might lap up the card games, other's might stick firmly to the board game stuff.Cynics would probably argue that you can download most of the stuff present on 42 All-Time Classics for the princely sum of almost nowt on a PC, but that's kind of missing the point. The entire package is about casual, portable pick-up-and-playability when you've got some time to kill. That being the case, the variety on offer here is simply staggering. The fact that Nintendo's poured so much energy into ensuring everything is solidly entertaining - with particular props going to the multitude of mulitplayer and online options - just sweetens things further. Providing you know that you're not getting the bleeding edge of interactive entertainment, 42 All-Time Classics is just about the epitome of what handheld gaming should be. Its impressive scope of content and features means this could easily be the best twenty quid you're ever likely to spend on your DS.", "date": "Oct 3, 2006"}
