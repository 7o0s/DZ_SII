Multiplayer options are abundant, and include both Internet play through one of Blue Byte's servers as well as multiple players on a single computer. While the Internet is can be too laggy for a precision action game, hooking up a couple of Sidewinders for a multiplayer game is great, if you can handle the smaller, reversed perspective the player on the other end of the court must deal with.  On the court, the game looks sharp. 3D acceleration is handled in either Direct3D or 3Dfx Glide, as well as a software renderer, and a variety of players and courts keeps the graphical interest up so everything doesn't look the same all the time. Unfortunately, the 2D sprites off court--trees, fences, spectators, and such-all look like cardboard cutouts. Gameplay options are suitably rich, letting you delve into anything from training sessions with a pitching machine to one-off matches, tournaments and even a full season.  The on-screen AI seems tough enough at first, but a lot of that is due to how long it can take to get used to the controls. Serving is particularly difficult at first, as your aiming point is depicted by a quickly floating cursor in your opponent's half of the court, but on thorough playing it actually does work pretty well and requires timing and quick thinking. After that it's a matter of positioning yourself for the return and knowing which kind of return is most likely to throw your opponent--lob, slice, or slam.  Sadly, there's one hole in the single player AI that detracts from the overall tennis experience. Unlike real tennis, if you run forward and crowd the net in this sim, you will make things very difficult for the opponent and much easier for yourself. Although I admittedly didn't notice this at first, once another reviewer pointed it out to me, it quickly became very hard to resist. It's a shame, but anyone who buys this game will probably stumble upon this sooner or later and forever face the temptation of the easy win.  Another problem with the AI is that sometimes it just seemed to give up. If I managed to hit a ball that was clearly going to score a point, nine times out of ten, the computer player wouldn't even try for it. It's would be much more fun if you could actually watch the 'agony of defeat' as the computer player dove for the ball and came up short. This sort of luke-warm response really takes the thrill out of victory, and can make you feel a bit cheated when you manage a good play.   Beyond the crowding issue, there are also a few other minor problems with control. You can get stuck on the boundaries of the court, and control is also a bit sticky when you're trying to set yourself up for a return, since depressing a return swing key also forces your character to stop moving. My instinct was to keep moving to where I knew the ball was going but start my swing beforehand with one fluid motion. In order to make a solid return in the game you really need to move, get planted, and then swing. Finally, there's no way for you to jump or dive for a ball. Just need another few inches for that return? That's just too bad. Apparently your virtual player is worried more about hurting his knees than getting a point.  Even with all of its quirks, Game, Net & Match is a good take on computer tennis, and a particularly outstanding entry for a sport that is rarely covered at all.  The game's graphics are sharp, the options thorough, and with a little work done on control and AI a sequel could be a real winner. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 13, 1998"}
