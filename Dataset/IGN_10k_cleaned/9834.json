Omega Five is one of those rarer of Xbox Live Arcade titles, a fresh IP from Japan courtesy of publishers Hudson, and it may well prove to be the best of the bunch.   Developed by Natsume of Harvest Moon fame, Omega Five is a more intense experience than their pastoral series, taking the form of a traditional horizontal shooter in the mold of Gradius and R-Type. Like its forebears it's a game that can be unforgiving, but one that also has the potential to reduce those in its grasp into a hyperventilating husk desperate for another fix of digital carnage.   Big, solid, chunky metal  things to shoot at. Lovely.  Omega Five utilises the Robotron control system that now seems a prerequisite for shooters on Xbox Live Arcade. The left analogue stick moves your player around the screen while the right stick controls the direction of fire, much like its 360 counterparts Geometry Wars and Mutant Storm. Though the system is arguably too commonplace at the moment, there's no sense in complaining when it's put to such good use. It frees the game from the rigidity some traditional shooters suffer from, opening up the playing area and producing moments of delirious excitement as you're called upon to dispose of a screen full to tearing point of hostile elements.    In terms of the games back-story, well, there isn't any. And why bother? Who can honestly recall the plotlines of any straight-up shooter they've played? Okay, R-Type may have regaled us with tales of the Bydo Empire and Gradius V made a brave attempt to woo us with its inter-dimensional yarn, but it's a rare gamer who demands any narrative drive to their bullet hell.    You've initially two characters at your disposal, coming in the time-honoured flavours of nimble-but-underpowered and chubby-yet-potent. Ruby, tipping the more svelte end of the scale, has a mechanical arm following her around the screen that can deflect incoming flak. With a flick of the right trigger the arm can also latch onto enemies, dealing out a concentrated stream of fire that is quick to dispatch foes. The Tempest is the tubbier of the two characters first on offer and his attacks are short-range but more deadly. They also are primarily liquid based, allowing the 360 to flex its graphical muscle and filling the screen with viscous goo emanating from the rotund protagonist's nozzle. Upon completion of the game you'll be able to unlock two other characters, one substantially different from the starting roster and one offering an alternative take on one of the initial avatars.    Man bird robot thing attacks. Puts a smile on our face.  Your character has a health bar that can withstand around six hits, and on occasion you'll find a pick-up that will replenish your status. But just because Omega Five doesn't deal in one-hit kills don't be fooled into thinking it's easy-going. The first stage offers a gentle introduction to the mechanics, but soon after things take a turn for the twitch and by the time you reach the latter half of the game you'll find the edges of the screen slipping out of focus as you're called to draw upon all your reflexes and gaming instinct to survive the heady onslaught. At first there's only a mean-fisted amount of continues at hand, but continued play unlocks a more generous amount of credits to play with.      All four of the characters have access to three different weapon types, with three levels of upgrade available for each. It's a sight to behold when you're your weapon is maxed out, as the screen glistens with firepower. Unfortunately Omega Five suffers from that perennial problem of traditional shooters by stripping you of your upgrades upon being killed, creating some fist-clenchingly difficulty spikes as you re-spawn armed with just your basic weapon. It can feel akin to being pushed out onto the beaches of Normandy with nothing more than a spud-gun at your side, and deaths can quickly pile on top of each other as you're left unequipped to deal with the mayhem at hand.    Ruby's level 3 weapon can bounce off walls.  Each character also has a smart bomb in their arsenal, more of which can be acquired by collecting pink triangles dropped by downed enemies. They're well implemented, never threatening to break the balance of the gameplay but proving a useful resort in the more breathless moments. Another neat trick is a secondary dodge - pressing the right bumper warps the player across the screen, rendering them temporarily invincible at the price of a small amount of health. It's a neat feature that complements the rest of the weaponry well.    Graphically, the game is solid if nothing to get sweaty-palmed about. It's certainly the most visually impressive game available on Xbox Live Arcade  at least until Rez HD hits  offering well realised locales and a healthy dose of eye-searing lasers and explosions. The level design draws upon the strong artistry that sets Japanese-developed shooters apart and there's an enchanting array of differing enemy types that stand in your way. One criticism we do have is that the design of the playable characters doesn't seem up to the standards of the rest of the game and it's hard to get too attached to the generic heroes on offer. Likewise, the aural aspect of the game is competent, if nothing spectacular. There's a nice selection of hummable BGMs and the explosions rumble and grumble with the required ferocity, which is all that can really be asked for.    The visuals are brighter than the surface of Sirius.  It's worth making note of the online elements of Omega Five, as while they are in some respects limited they do play to the strengths of the game's genre. A challenge mode allows players to attack solitary stages in the quest for a high score, and once you've attained a respectable figure you can upload the video of your efforts to the online leaderboard. Here, not only can you gawp at some of the more astronomical scores, you can also download videos to find out exactly how they were achieved. It's a fantastic addition that acknowledges the score based mentality of traditional shooters, and more than makes up for the absence of an online co-op mode.Ultimately, the meat and bones of Omega Five are nothing you wont have seen before. Its a traditional shooter that can be beaten in an afternoon and thats not going to stretch your 360 to the limits of its ability. But it does have that certain factor that elevates it above the competition. Its a game that has the potential to entrance you, and when you close your eyes after an intensive session youll still be able to see the phosphorous lasers burnt onto the back of your retinas. Its got the addictive quality that ensures that one game is not enough, and its also got some unique online options that make the most of this. Finally, its a game that you most definitely should have sitting on your Xbox 360 hard drive.", "date": "Jan 9, 2008"}
