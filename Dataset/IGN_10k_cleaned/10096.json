Space Monkey, a very simple action game, is a perfect example of this new release slate. It's remarkably easy to pick up, exceedingly clever in execution, and does not fail to put a smile on your face. As a stolen moments game, something to burn five minutes on instead of fretting about the real world, this chimp is champ.   In the not-so-distant future, the orbital paths around the planet are full of junk. Unless this debris to cleaned up, there is no future for the space program. An ambidextrous monkey is enlisted to go into high orbit and pick up all the trash. While the monkey glides along an orbital path, you spin the monkey clockwise and counter-clockwise to pick up junk with his four appendages, as well as avoid hazardous materials like batteries that would, ahem, shock the monkey.   There are only two buttons to use in Space Monkey -- left or right on the directional pad, or 4 and 6. That's it. You must spin the monkey to grab debris like cups and wrappers with his hands and feet. Missed trash doesn't result in a punishment. You just have to keep going longer to reach your goal for each stage. To keep up the monkey's energy, you must spin him so his mouth lines up with half-eaten doughnuts that drift into view. (Yes, the monkey has a helmet on -- whatever.) And if a hazard flies across the screen, you just need to spin the simian so it doesn't collide with any of his extremities.   Now, that might sound perhaps a little too simple. Glu adds a few cool moves that give the game a much-needed goose. Monkeys love to have fun, and that goes for monkeys making like Major Tom. If the monkey grabs a yo-yo with his hands, he can play with it to earn extra points while grabbing trash with the other three limbs. You can grab two yo-yos to double your bonus points. However, if you touch trash with your yo-yo hand, the toy disappears. The monkey busies his feet with blue juggling balls. Once he has one for each foot, he starts bouncing them back and forth for extra points. The monkey can keep picking up juggling balls though to further multiply those bonus points. If you can manage to pick up four or five balls and hold a yo-yo, you can really rack up an impressive score. But keeping that playful vibe going for a long time requires real skill.   The monkey also has a spin move, easily activated by holding in the move buttons in one direction or another. If a battery of batteries surround the monkey, spin to kick them all away. But you cannot just sit 'n spin forever. If you do, the monkey gets sick and urps in his helmet, leaving you vulnerable. This spin attack is also useful in boss battles, when the monkey must repel an invader.   Space Monkey is a very cute little game. The monkey is very friendly, complete with adorable little expressions. (He makes a green face when he gets close to barfing.) If he's hocked by batteries, you see his skeleton beneath the frazzled skin, just like an old Looney Tunes cartoon. The backgrounds are solidly detailed as different things drift into view, like aliens and asteroids. I'm not quite sure why Glu included a junk viewer, but if you ever wanted a closer look at the garbage in space, you can do so.  Space Monkey is a very cute little action game that I heartily recommend to gamers that want a light distraction. I don't say that as an insult to Space Monkey, either. Quite the opposite. This is a charming game that's fun to play in quick doses -- a great time-killer. (Glu, this would work exceptionally well on the iPod.) If you want a casual game for your handset without block or gems, Space Monkey is a worthy download.", "date": "Feb 28, 2008"}
