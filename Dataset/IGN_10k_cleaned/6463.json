Though you fought hard (we hope) to defend your home planet, the game's sequel, UFO Aftershock, opens with the aliens in possession of the planet. The aliens, ridiculously called Ridiculans, have unleashed a terrifying biomass that's taken over the planet and perverted humanity (and the Ridiculans themselves) in a variety of dangerous ways. You take charge of a group of humans who fled the Earth and are just now returning to reclaim the planet.  The conflict has changed but the game has remained largely the same. Play alternates between a larger strategic layer where you manage your overall infrastructure and tactical sequences where you lead small squads of soldiers against the alien invaders and mutated humans. There are definitely some new gameplay elements here and a beefier engine but fans of the first game will definitely be familiar with the overall experience here.   One of the bigger changes to the strategic game is the inclusion of complex base building. If you manage to capture countries on Earth, you'll be able to construct a base to research new technologies and manufacture the equipment you'll need to combat the alien menace. Before you can successfully create a building, you'll need to research the plans for it. There's no shortage of research options early on in the game, so you'll need to think about where you want to be in two weeks before committing to a research path. There are tons of research requirements for nearly every object you'll need to make. Before creating laser rifles, for instance, you'll have to research plans to build the building that allows you to research the tech needed to build the laser weapons. Though each base is limited in the number of buildings it can house, you can successfully pool your research and manufacturing capabilities from multiple bases.  Maintaining diplomatic relations with the factions left on earth is crucial to your strategy. The human, cyborg and psionic factions all need to be courted in order for you to obtain new recruits to lead into battle. It's too bad then that there's really no diplomatic depth at all. There's no negotiation or alliance with any of these factions. You'll merely kill aliens in their province or send them vast quantities of resources in order to get them to like you. Once they like you, you can petition them to hire fresh recruits or ask them to send you vast quantities of resources.  There are now three resources to manage -- low-tech, high-tech and alien. Each province you control adds a number of these resources to your pool. Sadly, the resources aren't so hard to obtain that they're factor into your strategy. Sure, you'll need the right mix to construct certain buildings and maintain your relations with other factions but it's so easy to grab them from the provinces around you that you'll have a huge stockpile fairly early on.  Squad maintenance is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the strategic game, and one that pays huge dividends once you take the action to the battlefield. Squad members are rated in six key attributes which in turn generate values for a wide variety of skills. Boost a soldier's dexterity and he'll be better at using rifles or medkits. Boost his strength and he'll get better with close combat weapons and be able to carry more equipment. In addition there are now specialist packages your soldiers can qualify for. If they meet the right attribute prerequisites, you can elect to train your soldiers as specialists, giving them further bonuses with certain weapons or skills. The whole system works well to differentiate your soldiers and increase your sense involvement and investment.   Many have wrongly characterized the tactical side of this game as a turn-based. In fact, the tactical game runs in a frequently paused real-time format, much like Baldur's Gate. By default the pause triggers are far too frequent and really compromises the flow of the battles. The game will pause at every single event you can imagine -- whenever you're attacked, when you run out of ammo, when you spot an alien, or even when you're just standing around. I quickly turned off all the pause triggers except for the one caused by alien sightings and the game ran much more smoothly. Unfortuntately, the game still paused when my soldiers spotted unconscious aliens.      Fans of X-COM, Silent Storm, Jagged Alliance or Commandos should have some idea how these battles play out. Your squad members' abilities determine how effective they are on the battlefield. Maneuvering so you can attack from a position of advantage is the real challenge here. You'll need to make sure that your squad members cover each other as they move through each level.  Unfortunately, there are no formation controls for your squad, meaning you'll have to manage each soldier's path individually if you want them to maintain a certain position relative to each other. Otherwise they just clump together as tightly as possible, ensuring that only two or three of them can fire at newly discovered enemies. The enemy AI also seems to suffer from a herding instinct. The aliens and mutants you encounter are nearly always clumped together in a level. Find one and you're sure to find the rest right around the corner.   Nevertheless, the action is fairly enjoyable. Still, the tactical combats quickly become monotonous. There are probably less than a dozen or so maps throughout the game so you'll find yourself fighting over the same ground again and again. A little more variety would help in terms of enemies as well. As it is, you'll be fighting the same five or six alien types throughout the game. The range of mission types is also relatively small. Any one of those limitations would be enough to make the game seem too repetitive. Combined together they challenge your patience more than your tactics.  That's true of the overall game as well. Though the game gets more rewarding and complicated with every passing hour, the pace of the campaign is remarkable slow. You can play all day and barely make it through a few weeks of game time. Given that the vast size of the campaign, you could well be playing this one for a long time to come. It's then that the repetition of enemies, battle maps and mission types really start to get aggravating.  Lots of reviewers have complained that the game is extremely buggy and crash happy. I'm not entirely sure how we've managed to avoid most of those problems but, apart from a few minor bugs, the game has been relatively stable for us. To be fair, the game's overall performance seems pretty terrible considering the systems we're playing them on -- load and save times are far too long and the tactical engine has some noticeable hiccups and stutters. We can also say that the StarForce copy protection system seems to be much less problematic now. It's still a little obnoxious, but at least it's not screwing up like it used to.  Given how the game looks and runs I'm really shocked at the high system requirements and the massive footprint of the game. The tactical game uses some nice effects, from raging fires to bright laser beams, but the overall character models and environmental textures leave a bit to be desired. With the high requirements, I'd have expected the game to include a nice physics system like we found in Silent Storm. Unfortunately, there's nothing really dynamic about the way battles affect the world around them.  Sounds are also a big generic. The effects lack any sense of weight and the voice cues used during the missions get quite repetitive. Happily, the dialogue in between missions is quite good. Considering that the original X-COM is easily one of the best video games we've ever played, it's perhaps a little unfair to put it beside new efforts in the genre. Still, given the indirect connection and tremendous similarity between this game and the original X-COM series, UFO Aftershock inevitably invites those comparisons. While UFO Aftershock has most of the components that made X-COM so enjoyable, it's just not as satisfying. The battles are far too short and far too repetitive and the campaign just seems to drag on endlessly. More recent games like Silent Storm or Commandos 3 offer just as much sophistication and loads more polish.", "date": "Dec 2, 2005"}
