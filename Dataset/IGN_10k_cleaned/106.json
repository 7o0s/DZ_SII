It's known to be more slowly paced than other series  more methodical and tactical. It's known to be unique in its core gameplay mechanic, which almost always involves careful manageable of a floating pod called the Force. And above all it's known to be really stinking hard. So you're going to have to be very dedicated or very foolish to get very much immediate satisfaction out of this latest Virtual Console release from the series, as Super R-Type from the SNES is by far the most difficult of all the games in the R-Type franchise.   And, unfortunately, it's not a good kind of difficult. Super R-Type's challenge factor is ramped up by questionable design decisions and alterations made to the game when it was first ported to the Super NES from its arcade source, where it was known as R-Type 2.   The trouble comes mostly through the game's lack of checkpoints. As a side-scrolling starship shooter, your task in each level of Super R-Type is to guide your small, one-man fighter through the ranks of the villainous Bydo Empire, dodging obstacles, earning power-ups and destroying a boss at the end of it all. But, through it all, you've got to be flawless  because if you die at any point in any level, you're thrown all the way back to the beginning of that stage. All the way back.   You'd better hope you take this guy out without getting hit, because otherwise it's back to the very beginning of the level for you.  It's incredibly frustrating and borderline unfair, and it's an issue that's further complicated by the fact that it's not rectified by the game's own difficulty selector. It might make sense for you to be forced to fly a perfect run through each stage in Hard mode, but what about first time players just getting their feet wet with the Novice setting? Sorry, junior, death has the same repercussions for you  Super R-Type shows no mercy.   Now it might be forgivable for this game, which was one of the very first 16-bit SNES titles available at that system's launch, to have one annoying issue in place like that. But the list of woes only grows the farther you go  Super R-Type is additionally plagued by ridiculous amounts of slowdown when lots of enemies and explosions are on-screen at once (which is almost always the case) and, further, the visuals are considerably downgraded from the arcade original. Some stages are missing entire set elements, which is a problem that likely wouldn't have existed had Irem not rushed this release to market right when the SNES was first coming out, and instead took the time to explore the true capabilities of the hardware.   Underlying all of these complaints is a game design that can still be solid and satisfying, so shooter fans shouldn't be completely turned off  this is still R-Type, and it's still compelling in its own way. The Force pod that you can earn and attach to your ship is still a capable piece of equipment, functioning both as a shield and a satellite that can stay affixed to the front or rear of your vessel or be sent flying independently around the screen. You can gain boosted speed, secondary-fire missiles and upgraded laser attacks by gathering power-ups, as well, and can blaze quite a path of destruction with weapons like the ricocheting laser beams that bounce off walls at 45 degree angles.But all of this is also available elsewhere on the Virtual Console, in packages that cost the same 800 Wii Points as this download does and don't have the same annoying drawbacks  the original R-Type is available in its TurboGrafx-16 form, and the far better SNES installment R-Type III: The Third Lightning redeemed the series' potential on Nintendo's home console a few years after Super R-Type's relative failure. I'd recommend giving this particular download a pass and choosing one of those other two R-Types instead, unless you're just a diehard fan looking for a hard time.", "date": "Mar 28, 2008"}
