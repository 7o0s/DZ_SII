After all your trials, tribulations, and a horde of gameplay hours, you've reached the end of your journey.  Thanfully, the folks at New World Computing aren't letting you so much as put your sword down for a moment before unleashing Armageddon's Blade, the highly anticipated expansion to Heroes of Might and Magic III.  It should come as no surprise that this installment is every bit as entertaining as its big brother, and the subtle enhancements that have been implemented make it all that much more a solid, turn-based playing experience.  The core story line throws players in the midst of the gravest of scenarios.  Evil king Lucifer Kreegan has had a magnificent vision involving the collection of three artifacts.  These relics, known as the Breastplate of Brimstone, the Shield of the Damned, and the Sword of Hellfire, are discovered by Kreegan in his dream and combined by an old man into the namesake of this game, Armageddon's Blade.  According to legend, this rather loathesome weapon has the power to set the entire world ablaze.  Pairing the ideas of a world of fire with a guy named Lucifer doesn't exactly scream originality, but worse things have been done in the ways of plot.   Setting the story line on the back burner, we can move along to the part of expansion packs that makes everyone who gets them absolutely giddy--new goodies.  New World Computing has packed their latest adventure with both the usual expected bonuses and some generally helpful enhancements.  In the former category, players will be greeted with 6 new campaigns, around 35 new single missions, 7 new ~veteran Heroes~, and 12 new creatures to recruit into their armies.  The game also boasts a new town type, called a Conflux, 2 heroes classes to go along with it, and 10 shiny, fresh multiplayer maps.  These additions, though certainly worth checking out, aren't exactly heart-stoppers on the surprise scale.  But hey, it wouldn't really be an expansion if it didn't include these now would it?  Moving away from the bread and butter of the standard meal, Armageddon's Blade tosses a few extras in our direction to spice up the mix.  Topping the list is an improved map editor, as well as a fully functional campaign editor.  Map design is extremely intuitive with the tool set provided and should allow for more than adequate numbers of player designed adventures to spike replayability.  Another coin in the replay value jar comes from the new random map generator.  Using this utility, gamers can enjoy virtually limitless different scenarios in which to play.  Also in the realm of enhancements is the option to recruit lesser developed creatures when you're short on cash.  In the previous installment, once you chose to upgrade a unit producing facility, you were forced to pay the additional fee associated with recruiting higher level beings.  This time around, if you've been a little frivolous with the kindgom treasury, you have the ability to opt for the less expensive, less powerful entity that was available before the upgrade.  This is helpful if you are going for sheer numbers in your army, but don't squelch all the time.  If you're too much of a Scrooge you're going to end up walking away from your battles with nothing but a damaged ego and a broken lance.  On a creatures standpoint, some of the newbies are more worthwhile than others.  Pixies and Sprites for example, while speedy in movement and cheap to recruit, are effectively useless unless found in large groups.  The problem with this is that, upon finding such a group, an enemy hero casting Blind or a similar spell can render the entire squad about as combat effective as a swarm of houseflies.  On the other extreme there lies my personal favorite fantasy creature, the fiery bird known as the Phoenix.  Though a little less rare in this turn-based strategy than in a standard role-playing environment, this flying inferno is still a force to be reckoned with.  Few other creatures can stand toe-to-toe with a Phoenix and leave the battlefield under their own power.  In fact, the only original monsters that can do so come in the form of the titles' advertised ~slew of fearsome new dragons~, with ~slew~ apparently meaning ~four~.  Don't worry, you'll get plenty of opportunities to go head long into battle against these bad boys, especially considering the fact that one of the campaigns revolves around a dragon slayer.  Ultimately, Armageddon's Blade is just more of the same of what made the Heroes series as successful as it is today, with a few additions and enhancements that make it a fresh experience.  But hey, as it was said in the full version review, ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it~.  The entire gamut of these games has legions of followers, and none of the fire should be taken away by this latest edition.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Nov 16, 1999"}
