The Raven Project falls into the latter category.  After you suffer through the usual crappy FMV nonsense, The Raven Project puts you in the cockpit of a spaceship, flying over some low hills. There's lots of land and air targets to destroy, but the control is so weak it makes actually shooting anything a matter of luck more than skill.  There's a walker mech, the Lynx, for you to drive, but it controls just like the spaceship, so what's the point? There's also no compass, so if you get lost, you're screwed. There's a really bad space level too, but it's not even worth going into. Take our word for it, this game sucks.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
