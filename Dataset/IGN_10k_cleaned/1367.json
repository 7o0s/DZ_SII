Most often it's Dragon Ball Z.  ~Dragon Ball Z game?~ ~Dragon Ball Z game!~ ~Dragon Ball Z for PS2?~ ~Where can I get Dragon Ball GT Final Bout?!~ ~Codes for Dragon Ball Z!~ ~How do I unlock Son Son Go-Ho-Wibbly-Wobbly-Yadda-Yadda? Tell me!~, and on and on and on until I'm this close to breaking my Arcadia of My Youth laserdisc in half and stabbing the little thugs with the sharp ends.  But sometimes it's people asking about other anime, be it Slayers or Evangelion or Tenchi Muyo (hocch! ptui!), and none of them seem to understand the fundamental truth behind almost all anime-licensed games, which is that they suck.  Remember that cartoons are a mainstream phenomenon in Japan.  They're popular, lots of people are into them.  Like movies over here.  So extend the analogy to games, and you come to the conclusion that anime-licensed games there are the rough equivalent of movie-licensed games here.  Get the picture yet?  Not only are they the equivalent of movie-licensed games, they're frequently on the level of rancid movie-licensed Ocean NES games, brilliant efforts like RoboCop and The Addams Family.  If you're too young to remember, be grateful.  On the other hand, to those who may be inclined to rail against Activision's Orphen in an excess of maddened nostalgia flashback, I would note that this is not even close to the worst that anime games get (that would be somewhere in the vicinity of From Software's Spriggan: Lunar Verse), but at the same time, it's still far from good.  Orphen isn't bereft of finer points, but its design is too slapdash to make up for the drag factor of its license - I doubt even the finest game could survive having Orphen's characters star in it - and Activision's localization job just makes things worse.  Gameplay  As a game, Orphen could be described as a sort of train wreck, although I mean that in the nicest possible way.  Panzer Dragoon Saga somehow got going on the wrong line towards Zelda 64, built up a good head of steam, ran over Lara Croft while she was desperately trying to throw the switch that might avert a terrible collision, and wham, out of the wreckage clambers an arrogant shylock with a penchant for tossing fireballs at people.    That's Orphen, the title character, accompanied by his students Magnus and Cleo on a journey to nowhere in particular.  Well, that's speaking in the general sense - in the context of the game, the journey is to Chaos Island, where our anti-heroes wind up after hopping the wrong sailing ship and being wrecked by a giant sea monster (RPG law #24: ocean voyages must involve either sea monsters or ghost ships, if not both).  Once there, a quest reveals itself, to find the many pieces of the Crystal Egg by time-shifting back and forth between different ages of the island's past.  The adventure progresses in fairly linear fashion, through dungeon exploration, realtime cutscenes, the occasional animated sequence (nicely presented by the PS2's video compression) and battles that employ a real-time combat system reminiscent of the aforementioned Panzer Saga.  Positioning isn't as much of a factor as it was in that game, though - the central tactic to get your mind around is the timing of your various attacks.  Orphen has four spells he can use at any given time during a fight, each mapped to one of the face buttons.  As you progress through the game, you'll acquire defensive shields, close-range strikes, and a variety of different long-range attacks that employ a lock-on targeting system.  For the most part, you can trigger a spell at any time, although you can only have one spell active at once - so you can't have your shield up and call down lightning bolts at the same time.  Thus, the key to winning battles is learning when you can do what, and it's a process with a certain amount of depth to it, thanks to the customizable spell set.  Eventually, though, the battles get repetitive - you're just memorizing a new pattern each time, and once you have it down, victory is a matter of repeating the same options over and over again.  Shield, wait for the lock-on, fireball, sword, shield, etc.  NPCs occasionally take part in fights, but you have no control over their actions, just that of the active main character.  Outside combat, you run into similar problems.  There are touches of action and platforming gameplay, like a 3D equivalent of Valkyrie Profile, but the linear progression and dungeon design means that exploring the world grows tired as well.  Presentation  Orphen is a game very much in the cinematic RPG tradition.  This has the potential to do one of two things for the game - it could either redeem itself through an engaging story and likable characters, or it could make a bad situation worse.  In this case, chalk one up in the latter column.  Or, for that matter, chalk three or four up, one each for every leading character that I wanted to wallop with a brick every time they opened their badly-synched mouths.  The prime offender here is Orphen himself, conceived as a hip young sorcerer with an attitude and executed as an obnoxious young sorcerer in need of a savage beating from the bokken-wielding enforcers of the UNC Kendo Club.  For easily-confused fanboys who may be inclined to disagree, the following handy diagram:        HARD CORE PLAYA FROM THE STREETS    WHAT WACK WANTS TO BE WHEN IT GROWS UP    The game's dub is frankly wretched, exacerbating the effect of personalities that I would hate in any language: Orphen's overdone 'tude, Cleo's stereotypical chick hanger-on, and Magnus' blend of obsequiousness and cheap bravado.  Sephy might be likable if better-acted, but her voice sounds far older than the character ought to be, and can't deliver her more serious lines with enough credibility.  Sadly, the only member of the cast to receive a thumbs-up is Dorchin, AKA Googly-Eyed Dude, who wins acclaim through his wonderfully endearing uselessness.  Sometimes you get to like someone for the strangest reasons.  But I sense I have not railed against the dub quite enough, so let's go back to make note of the poor acting and significant synching problems.  By the latter I refer to two issues: one, the synchronizing of lines to lip movements, which isn't very accurate, and two, the larger problem of directing the lines such that they fit into the scenes as a whole.  The characters' speech comes together like bits of a jigsaw puzzle that aren't supposed to connect to each other - there are weird pauses, loads, visual gestures, and other obstacles breaking up the flow of the dialogue.  In part, I expect this is the result of poor direction and load management on the part of the original creators, although having to fit new dialogue into the game certainly exacerbated the situation.  Graphics  It's too bad that so much of Orphen should be such a bother to work through, because every so often you come upon a real visual high point.  Many of the battles in the game are built up into long scripted sequences, with original, unusual settings and cutscenes separating different phases of lengthier fights, and they're often just gorgeous to look at, well-directed scenes with great 3D artistry and graphical effects over it all.  The giant monsters are very impressive, and even more pedestrian battles show off cool explosions, lighting, and particles.  If the set-pieces are excellent, though, the slower scenes in between them show where less effort was put in.  Most of the ordinary dungeon exploration in the game isn't much to look at, although again, every so often you find something that's worth seeing.  Wandering around the ship in the very beginning of the game, it's a little bit jarring to hike for several minutes through bland hallways and cabins, and then all of a sudden come across a beautifully-appointed stateroom filled with animating curtains and chandeliers, surrounded by lighting effects from torches on the walls and open windows.  Sound  Have I said enough about the dub yet? [audience: ~YES!~] Alright, then.  It's too bad that the voices should make me want to hammer on the mute button, because the rest of the soundtrack is actually very pleasant.  Subtract Orphen yelling gibberish about Pyro and so firth over and over during every fight, and you can appreciate the crashes and screams, the crack of lightning, and the mild, nice-beat-I'll-give-it-an-85 battle theme.  Some elements of the soundtrack are a little less welcome, though - every so often, the teeth-grinding factor a cutscene will spike up even higher thanks to some soap-opera-esque effect.  Outside battles, though, the game favors more ambient sounds that suit the atmosphere equally well.  If Chaos Island offered you a little more room to stretch your legs and wander around, the accompaniment would be even more pleasant, but as it is, you're generally speeding from point A to point B too quickly to enjoy the scenery and such.   If you could get beyond the violence-inspiring characters and pedestrian story, Orphen actually has some things going for it - its visual highlights, and some of its more original gameplay concepts.  This fall, though, the RPG market is so crowded with absolutely classic titles that almost nobody's budget will have room for something this flawed.  The fun of the occasional epic battle is crippled by the dozen mind-meltingly dull conversations you have to sit through to get to it, and this is an unfortunate blot on Activision's localization record.I can tell that Orphen's developers are on the right track, though.  They obviously have skill as far as 3D graphics are concerned, and they've hit upon ideas with the battle system that could be developed into something more streamlined in a future game.  When they're planning that game, though, I recommend that they find themselves a better license - like I say, nobody could make a tolerable Orphen game.  Or, best of all, they could try creating something entirely original.  Now there's an idea...", "date": "Oct 23, 2000"}
