{"name": "Crime Killer", "name_review": "Crime Killer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/07/03/crime-killer-2", "text": "Eager to jump on the surging wave of popularity encircling the vehicular combat genre, Interplay has delivered Crime Killer. And while the game does test the PlayStation's graphical limits, it leaves depth and gameplay behind in the process.  It's the next millennium, crime is on the rise, and you're a cop smack dab in the middle of the mayhem. Three different vehicles are provided (police car, motorcycle, and flying wing), a huge arsenal is up for grabs, and there are 20 missions to tackle. It sounds good enough on paper, but falls short in final presentation.  Crime Killer's ultimate shortcoming comes in the fact that despite this implied variety - and the potential of the concept - there's just not that much to the game. What you're ultimately left with is a shallow, rudimentary shooter encased in a brilliantly-shining outer shell.   That shell comes in the form of a solid, blindingly-fast 3D engine - we're talking a consistent 60fps - combined with outrageous colored lighting. Truly awe inspiring stuff, but after the first several minutes of play, it comes across more as a disguise for sub-par game than a compliment to what's underneath.  After enduring the first few missions, the game's faults become all too apparent, and the redundancy sets in. Even the two-player deathmatch option can't offset the fact that Crime Killer's nothing you've seen and played all before.  In the end, Crime Killer proves to be a great concept that's fallen victim to below average execution. And in such a do-or-die genre, that's a fatal defect. Diehard fans of the genre stand to face severe disappointment; those hungry for all things related to it should consider this a definite try-before-you-buy.  Randy Nelson", "date": "Jul 3, 1998"}
