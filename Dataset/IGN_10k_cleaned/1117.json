And though I'll forever be cursed by the late-night TV gods of TNN for saying so, the vast majority stink like week-old tuna.  Thank goodness Sierra hasn't lost their taste for seafood.  Whoa there, boy, we'd better not be too hasty with the tartar sauce.  First, there's some hard work to be done.  Trophy Bass 4's motto is ~early to bed, early to rise makes a computer angler lazy, stir crazy, and pleasantly surprised.~  Feel free to be a knucklehead on custom designed fishing trips, but the sooner you're out trolling the lake in tournament or career mode the better.  Catching fish isn't just a sport, brother, it's a way of life.  Translation: If your sorry ass wants to accrue fame and fortune or gain access to the professional competitions, expect to put in work under the gun.  A total of twenty hot spots including Lake Lanier, Dale Hollow, and Bull Shoals Lake are the placid settings for the unfolding events.  The program plays mix n' match with rain, snow, muddy water, and additional environmental conditions to cough up a new scenario each time you landlubbers leave the shore.  Species of fish ranging from smallmouth bass to rainbow trout inhabit them thar waters, and they don't take kindly to relocating into the livewell, unless plied with the appropriate type of bait.  Prudently, the computer has seen fit to jam thousands of rod, reel, and lure combinations into your tackle box, though scant few will be used by an individual player.  Information overload would be a problem were it not for the splendid interface, which is unrivaled in power or scope by any other fishing game on the market.  Ergonomic decision trees, an in-depth preview mode, instant pull-down menus, and an online help feature will preserve the product's integrity in the mainstream consumer's eyes.  A hybrid control system, born of the mouse and keyboard, facilitates two-click casting, depthfinder usage, sailing, and reeling in the line.  Technology's on your side, as are the advantageous Pro Tips and new floating camera options.  Trophy Bass 4 is a visual tour de force from start to finish.  This game flaunts its graphical superiority whenever and wherever possible.  Turbulent and calm waterways lie beneath beautiful skies of blue, which turn a menacing shade of gray when thunderstorms threaten.  Crisp, polished 3D textures are plastered onto anglers, boats, and your quarry glimpsed through an underwater view that rears its head when a lure hits the drink.  Up close or in murky waters, the scene's not nearly as breathtaking, but we've definitely seen worse.  The heart and soul of an outdoor sport involving animals (except for dog sled racing and Dan's mysterious forays to ~dance with the hyena~) lies in the ultimate confrontation between the hunter and his prey.  Feisty as they can be with a hook in their guts, the fish don't come off looking like the brightest apples on the tree, nor do they shy away from casts or boats revved up to full throttle.  Like a two-year old or game reviewer, they can't sit still, paddling aimlessly about in search of an unknown goal.  Reeling 'em in and scooping 'em up requires sharp reflexes and an understanding that the staccato beeping noises coming from the man/fish power bar aren't a positive sign.  Still, they pucker up real nice for photo album shots.  Far superior to EA's magnificent Championship Bass in every area besides fun factor, Trophy Bass 4 has fought tooth and nail to earn its accolades.  Beyond the single player game, the package touts a definitive multiplayer experience and more fishing tips and gear than any human being has a conceivable use for.  As wet n' wild forays go, you're staring at one hell of a catch if you're into fishing sims.  -- Scott Steinberg   Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 21, 2000"}
