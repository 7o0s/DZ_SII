Years ago, we had the Age of the Platformer, when we saw the release of Super Mario 64 that spawned Spyro, Croc, Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, and more. Then we had the Age of Real-Time Strategy, with Warcraft II paving the way for Age of Empires and Command & Conquer. Just recently we saw an influx of Vietnam-related titles, from Conflict: Vietnam to Vietcong: Purple Haze. Let's not even talk about the Age of the MMO, which darn well may never end. And now, we find ourselves in what is seemingly the middle of an era where it is all too easy to get your pirate on.   The dichotomy of these thematic phases is that, while there are a lot of similarities between all the games in a particular genre or theme, each tries to make itself as different as possible to elevate itself above the competition. Every game has its devout fans, of course, just as the very same game will have some people calling it the worst idea ever in entertainment.    So, just what is the consensus for Playlogic International's newest release, Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales? Is it the greatest pirate game ever, able to topple the all-mighty Sid Meier's Pirates!? Or is it destined to rest at the bottom of Davy Jones's locker? Read on to find out.   We Don't Need No Stinkin' Story   When we previewed AoP at E3 in 2005, developer Akella had told us that in the interest of player freedom, there would be no storyline, encouraging the player to make the adventure himself or herself. Akella apparently changed its mind by E3 2006, as our first hands-on preview showed us that a storyline had been integrated into gameplay. However, our preview copy was, naturally, incomplete, so we couldn't exactly see how the storyline worked into the overall structure of the game.   Now that we've got the final copy in our hands, we're slightly disappointed in the story aspect. It starts promising enough: two half-siblings exist, children of a pirate who dreamed of uniting the Caribbean islands under his rule but ultimately failing.   You play as either sibling, the half-brother Blaze Shark or the half-sister Beatrice Shark. As the game opens, some mysterious guy walks up and gives you a piece of a map. It's worthless by itself, so naturally the next step is finding the other half.   Sounds good, right? Problem is that the game doesn't give you any direction to the other half. It doesn't even give you direction to get direction to the other half, if that makes any sense. And, without giving spoilers, the story is pretty lame after that opening. Oh, sure, there's some adventure here and there, interspersed with some cut scenes, but it's extremely clear that it was pretty much tacked on late in the development cycle.    The story isn't the only thing that seems a little sparse: the overall presentation is lacking as well. Death is accompanied only by a still picture of a gravestone for about four seconds, followed by the title screen. There's no special music, no special animation (aside from your falling corpse or sinking ship), not even the dreaded ~game over.~ AoP takes a definite minimalist approach to conventional game aesthetics, which may turn some off.   Gameplay   Before getting into specifics, let's be clear: regardless of the story, regardless of the graphics, regardless of absolutely anything else in this review, Age of Pirates will live and die by how much you like its gameplay. And personally, we found the gameplay of it extremely likable and pleasing.     Almost the entire game will take place on the sea. You can leave from whatever port you happen to be in, and you can sail around in the Caribbean until you run out of food (or until the crew revolts). On the ocean will be tons of ships, and all of them are able to be attacked. A single ship is used no matter how many happen to be in the fleet, but after hitting the keyboard key to engage, you'll see how many ships are involved. At that point, you can say ~my bad~ and sail away, or get your cannons dirty with some explosive violence.   Sea battles can be pretty frantic, as any fleet involved in a fight can have up to four ships. That doesn't sound like much, but when you've got four, your enemies have four, and some allies have four things can get pretty crazy.   Luckily fights on the sea are more about skill than luck. Sure, you could be unlucky and have your cannons randomly explode when you try to fire a salvo. Your crew's experience, however, will factor into whether your cannons are loaded right to prevent these explosions. Strong crews also give you better accuracy and faster reloading times. If you dropped the money on getting an officer with high cannon skills, so much the better.    It sounds a little overwhelming, and it will be on your first try. Once you master the complexities of the system (which are no more complex than the typical RPG or Massively Multiplayer Online game), you'll start to see the depth the game offers, and you'll see the subtly of your decisions. For example, you gain attribute points when you gain levels; do you invest those points in making your cannons more accurate or your fencing skill stronger? Everything is related, and everything will help you in some way, but you'll have to weigh the pros of one option with the pros of another.   Aside from shooting down other ships, you'll encounter plenty of boarding opportunities as well. Line up next to a ship, and you'll automatically send your pirate crew (and yourself) onto the enemy deck. These land battles are far less interesting, as they break down into Dynasty Warriors-esque insanity, with dozens of men on each side randomly slashing each other.   Provided you survive that, you'll then engage the captain of the enemy vessel one-on-one in his cabin. The fencing engine really shows its weakness here: although you have a variety of attacks, blocks, and feints at your disposal, you only need to worry about dodging and thrusting. We found that a very sound strategy is to basically attack as many times as possible, then run around in circles until our energy recovered. Repeat until the captain is down: simple and boring.    With the captain killed, you can loot the ship as you desire, then swap it or add it your fleet, provided you have the room and the captain-eligible officer. After that, it's back to the sea.   Although you can engage in legal (and illegal) trading, you're more than likely not interested in that. This isn't Patrician 3, after all. Plus, economic changes seem arbitrary at best; there is no supply and demand system in place. Looting ships' cargo gives a very small boost to gold amounts compared to the direct gold bonus anyway. You can also take prisoners for ransom, but you won't get much for it.   Taking out ships no matter their loot values yields you experience points, which we have alluded to already. After enough experience points, you gain a level, and possibly some attribute points or traits. All of these are well explained by holding down the right mouse button over the entry. For example, hold the button whilst the cursor is over the ~Watcher~ trait, and you'll see that it will give you a 25% chance of evading fights and other negative encounters at sea. Reading the explanations and seeing the mathematical reason for accepting or declining a given trait is very, very appreciated.     As you level up and visit taverns (always the hangout for pirating types), you'll start getting new pieces of the storyline. It's that simple. So no matter what you do, whether you sign up with a nation and do their missions, or you do random missions for the random people around the ports, or you just hunt down and loot ships on the high sea, you'll be working toward the story. It's a good idea, but again, some help from within the game to be pointed in the right direction would have been nice.   Pretty much the only other major activity in Age of Pirates is taking over cities. This is only possible once you have a very capable fleet that can destroy a city's fort, followed by docking and taking out all the remaining guards. It's not easy, but once you've got the city under your command, you can create buildings and hone its defenses, letting the city make money for you. Naturally, the city will be attacked by others, so you'll have to be ready to help it out personally if need be.    The ultimate goal of Age of Pirates, whether you're intentionally following the story or not, is to capture every single city. Even on the easiest difficulty, this will take quite awhile. Still, you don't have to aim this high; with the random mission structure of the game, you could be just as satisfied as working with a nation for dozens of hours on end. Though the missions get a little repetitive, there's always something for you to spend money on (new officers, new ships, et al) that you'll want to earn just one more paycheck.   Once you've had it with all the adventuring, you can take your game online and do some deathmatching. That's right, Age of Pirates sports a multiplayer mode that gives you several different options to fight other captains on the high seas in several different flavors. However, be warned that it might be tough finding a good match, as the real draw is in the single-player experience. The multiplayer matches are pretty fun, though; the feature doesn't feel as tacked on or simplistic as it easily could have been.   Difficulty Tweaks for All   Speaking of difficulty, Age of Pirates sheds the conventional methods of giving a few static difficulty levels. To further the theme of complete player freedom, you can customize several aspects of the game world to aid or hinder your efforts, whatever they may be. Some combinations, such as enacting reduced damage from sea and/or land fights in your direction only will make the game much easier. Others, such as having everyone in the world hate you from the beginning, will make it next to impossible to succeed.    The difficulty has zero bearing on the storyline and eventual payoffs. The goal, no matter what you set in the pre-game, is still to control all the ports in the Caribbean. The difficulty adjustments will merely affect the journey getting there, although even when you're going for complete ease will take you a few dozen hours at least.   Player death is pretty common at the beginning until you get used to the system, even when the odds are completely in your favor, so you'll want to save often. You can set the game to autosave before entering boarding encounters, but otherwise you can save pretty much any time, anywhere. You can save in the middle of a sea battle or during a mission as long as you're not fencing anyone. We love free save systems but what's with the lack of a quick save key? Although there's some ~dishonor~ in saving every 30 seconds (I'm one of those types of gamers, so I don't mean to insult anyone), pretty much any RPG in this era calls for the quick save option to be present.   Sights and Sounds   It's quite a sight to zoom in on your ship and the sea, especially during sea battles. The single coolest moment is when you see the sun shine through your sails and try to fight through the other side. The fiery explosions from your cannons blowing apart (by enemy fire or that random chance) will jar you. The finer details of your ship, such as the men climbing up and down the rigging and the curvature of your sails as they catch the air will please your eyes.     Situation-based details are prevalent and appreciated. Lanterns light key points on ships at night, and the bluish lightning produced whilst sailing in storms looks deadly. Being chased around by the eye of a storm, in fact, is one of the most thrilling moments of the game.   The sound in Age of Pirates runs the gamut from average to obnoxious. The music is fitting, but nothing special. During boarding encounters, the sound of chaos and metallic clashing of swords will have an effect on you, until you realize that the noise is merely ambient and the second the battle is over, the sound disappears. It's disconcerting to say the least.    Aside from the two title characters, the character models are very plain. All ports look alike aside from the arrangements of their buildings. Ships show damage the same way (not location-based), and even though the explosions look pretty cool initially, the fire does not. Islands, especially on the overworld map, just look like rocks without personality. It's almost as if the artists at Akella worked overtime on the sky and close-in sea, then just threw everything else together with whatever stock models they had on their systems.   We grant of course that no one is getting Age of Pirates just for the graphics; it is an RPG after all. The graphics and sounds are serviceable.All our reviews seek to answer the same question: Is the game fun? Because when you remove all the debates about how much graphics matter, all the questions of design decisions that should have been left in or taken out, and all head-slapping moments of the lack of a quick-save key, what matters is the sense of enjoyment you get from spending your time with the game, or lack of it.Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales is an RPG first. It has a single goal that just takes a really long time to achieve, but can be ignored entirely. There is no end, provided you don't die and don't grab all the ports. It's pretty much a pirate simulator, though things like health and your personal cash not in your way of sailing around sinking things. But beyond shooting it out with rivals and running escort missions, there's not much left. Unless of course you're a fan of numbers and get a kick out of building up Blaze or Beatrice to your customized heart.If you have neither pirate game, you honestly couldn't go wrong with either one, as long as you take the casual/hardcore player idea into account. Either way, I personally will more than likely be playing Age of Pirates for another week or so at least, because even after writing this review, I'm still enjoying it.", "date": "Oct 9, 2006"}
