Every year -- especially around this end of the year holiday season -- publishers from all corners of the industry bombard the market with a new fully-controllable animal set loose in a colorful 3D world and on a mission to collect X number gravity-defying objects.  It's a formula that we've all seen put into practice many times over since the dawn of the 2D side-scroller.  And despite recent technological advancements in the art of gaming, it's a formula that publishers won't be giving up anytime soon for one specific reason -- 3D platformers still sell.   Don't ask us why, but they do.  With many superior platformers already available, such as Nintendo's own Super Mario Sunshine, it's sometimes surprising to see a company such as Electronics Arts (best known for its sports games) think it wise to join the competition.  But apparently, EA hopes that there's enough room in the market for both Mario and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, as the giant publisher is set to ship its new mascot hero to store shelves across all three major consoles and perhaps snag its share of the platforming pie.  And thanks to Ty's average, non-offensive gameplay, decent visuals, and good old-fashioned platforming nature, there's a good chance that it shall.    FeaturesOpen 3D platforming lets gamers roam and explore huge worlds in a non-linear fashion  Collect and use a wide variety of boomerangs, such as the   Cast of more than 50 characters, inspired by real-life indigenous animals of Australia  Numerous mini-games and varied gameplay mechanics  For 1 player  Surround sound supportGameplay  For those who spend their summer months in hibernation, please feel free to get yourself up to speed on Ty's basic gameplay mechanics via either our recently updated preview or hands-on impressions. For those who can't be bothered by unnecessary link clicking, then here's the basic drill: Ty is a friendly, easy-going Australian tiger sporting boxer shorts and packing boomerangs.  Ty must run around various 3D environments set in the Australian outback collecting an assortment of objects and whacking non-friendly animals on their skulls with the various boomerangs he discovers.  Or, being a tiger and all, players can opt to hit the X button and chomp them with his gaping set of razor-sharp fangs.   But really, Ty's an otherwise nice guy, as you'll witness for yourself during the many quick real-time cut-scenes breaking up the action along the adventure. Crazy little parrot and panda characters sporting wildly-decorated flower shirts will pose as scientists and gameplay experts, giving you tips on how to effectively wield the Tasmanian tiger or navigate the set of 3D worlds.  The entire dialog is charmingly Australian, packed with so many native quips that we can't help but smile with delight as Ty interacts with the other animals.  It's the kind of guilty pleasure one might receive from listening to a Foster's beer spot during The Crocodile Hunter reruns.  Ty's voice acting is crisp, hip, to the point, and quickly gets the gamer back to the platforming action without fear of boredom.   Ty's levels are nice and large.  Ty is obviously quite happy about it. Once turned loose into the gameplay again, boredom could very well be a reality for some gamers. Collecting hundreds of assorted objects across large, 3D landscapes has become a platforming standard, and gamers will be doing exactly that all over again at the controls of Ty.  The levels are somewhat diverse, with branching paths that allow gamers to explore the map freely and snag a number of items in any particular order.  Level diversity is nice, with many different types of areas scattered across each level.  For example, a forest level might feature wooded paths, shallow riverbeds, caves, tall rock pedestals, and raging waterslides.  Ty can run all around these areas, collecting his various odds and ends, talking to witty Ausie inhabitants, completing objectives, and whacking bad guys with his boomerangs along the way.   The problem isn't that Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is terribly flawed in any one category, but more that it just simply doesn't innovate enough to capture our attention.  For this reason, Australian developers Krome Studios openly admits to the title being aimed at the younger gamers in the crowd -- and there's really nothing wrong with that.  But with it comes the realization that Ty just doesn't have the wide-open, age defying appeal that other platformers attempt to capture within their adventure.  The gameplay mechanics here are extremely friendly, Ty controls extremely well, the camera is quickly responsive, and the end result is a standard platforming affair that plays without much serious challenge involved.  Younger gamers should be thrilled, while the more experience platforming crowd will find a solid yet simple run-jump-shoot-and-collect affair.   Graphics  Although not quite as visually impressive as its Xbox and PS2 counterparts, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger runs very smoothly on the GameCube.  The framerate is a brisk 30-60 FPS at all times, the draw distance stretches deep into the horizon, and the environments have a fair level of detail floating about.  The character designs are pretty sweet and evoke a classic Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia feeling in both their design and animations.  Ty tromps along with his oversized paws rhythmically thumping on the dirt path, swings his arms carelessly back and forth, and drops his jaw to the floor when it comes time to snap at an approaching enemy critter.  Other nice animations abound as you skid to a stop when running, hang from a cliff by the tips of your boomerangs, dive underwater, or even strike a celebratory pose when finding important items.  It's touches like this that will keep the targeted younger gamers hooked and charmed by the lovable tiger.   But for the rest of us, Ty's visual style will certainly not be triggering any primal animal instincts of pleasure.  The very cartoony rendering of the characters and environments are overly flat-shaded, without any detailed lighting or texture work to stimulate our senses.  The simple approach does strike a nostalgic chord, but it certainly won't induce drooling or draw your attention from some of the other more pretty Cube platformers on the way this year.   Sound  Right on par with the rest of its technical aspects, Ty's audio is refreshingly crisp, deep, and should do well to suit the younger platforming crowd.  Sound effects such as the breaking of wooden crates, chimes of collecting objects, splashes of water, and even spoken dialogue are all punctuated clearly through the speakers.  There are even a few subtle, area-specific effects woven into the mix, such as background animal noises you might find to expect in particular native environments.  The music is very nice as well, with an appropriate mix of mouth harps, guitars, and percussion flavoring the outback adventure appropriately.  If the rest of this gaming package is to be considered decisively average, then the audio could be thought of as just above the marks left by these other elements.  Introducing a brand-new platforming mascot in today's videogame industry and getting him to stick in the mind of gamers is a daunting task.  Australia-based developer Krome Studio clearly has some talented artists on its staff, as the entire line of Ty characters is extremely well-conceived and animated.  But getting Ty to the top of the favorite platforming mascot list is a feat that this simple Tasmanian tiger can't accomplish in his premiere 3D title.The ultra-friendly gameplay and simplistic cartoony rendering certainly won't put the face of this new mascot on any t-shirts anytime soon.  As a gameplay experience alone, the game walks a safe line that's been tread many times over in the past.  Gamers who have had their share of platform collection games will find absolutely nothing new or exciting in Ty worthy of their monetary or time investment.  But if you're shopping for a younger tyke who finds cartoon animals to be the next best thing since wallaby sandwiches, then Ty the Tasmanian Tiger will be a safe and simple selection.", "date": "Oct 23, 2002"}
