It's like eating peanut butter everyday. Sure, it's good at first, but after a month or so the word chunky is no longer synonymous with delicious. Lord Dominion and his armies of evil, their rampage fueled by the mystical source of power known as Energy-X, have stepped on pretty much every plane of existence from here to Nebraska (a dreaded realm on the other, far darker side of the cosmos). Only one last shred of untouched astronomical real-estate remains, the lovely celestial body that is Earth.But like swallowing spoonful after spoonful of Skippy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, walking all over the countless inhabitants of other worlds has begun to take its toll on old Dominion, lord of every dimension. A simple smash and enslave job will no longer float his boat, rock his socks, or cause his ocean to motion. So, in all the supreme wisdom that comes with being a classic super villain, which is to say very little, he concocts a grand scheme that involves empowering Earth's most villainous inhabitants with his Energy-X so that they would gain supernatural abilities and use their newfound powers to attack, torment, and destroy the rest of us. All the while he could sit back and merrily laugh, empty jar of Skippy on the floor.Mentor, the lone cerebrally astute secretive opposition of Dominion, overhears this and steals the Energy-X. His plan is to deliver all of it to Earth's best, brightest, and most noble purveyors of justice. But he gets shot down somewhere along the way, the cerebrally astute terrible pilot that he is. Next thing you know, canisters of purple glow are affecting all kinds of people, good and bad alike.Freedom Force is a squad-based, strategic, tactical RPG that plays out to the tune of a very nostalgic, accurately portrayed, but still loveably campy,  clichd, and stereotypical 60s comic book motif. The title's rich and pervasive storyline and backdrop are forwarded along by both non-interactive mid-mission scripted sequences, as well as other real-time cutscenes that transpire between levels. Essentially you begin as the lone MinuteMan. And, after completing a clever tutorial and a few missions, begin amassing your Freedom Force with intentions of brutalizing criminals and monsters normally out of the clubbing reaches of the law. In the delivery of this story, a few scripting bugs show up from time-to-time. Keeping the game speed up while transitioning into a cutscene seems to have the most notable adverse effects. Thankfully, these complaints never escalate beyond slightly annoying bugs. Aside from them, and sometimes abrupt alterations to the storyline (Man O' War and Sea Urchin just kind of show up and join the ranks of Freedom), the world of Patriot City is sound.  Purposely making an absurdly campy game is a brave, daring, and risky act. It manages to work here not only because the premise behind Freedom Force has gone almost entirely undone in PC gaming prior to this moment (intentionally anyway), but also because the developers at Irrational are so consistent in the way and quality in which they deliver everything. Voices, to sounds, to colors, to designs, to missions, to loading screens, all work toward a common goal of crafting believability, of advancing the general theme and immersing the player into the world it creates. Like any comic book worth its salt, the constant battles of Freedom Force are atypically outlandish, diverse and fun. Giant ants, dinosaurs, hulking robots, alien menaces... Oh yeah, they're all here. The objectives that keep these encounters cohesive and playable differ wildly, but most can eventually be devolved to the basic kill bad guys while not letting good guys get hurt formula.And here's where the inner beauty of Freedom Force begins to shine through (begins). Even at this primitive, rudimentary, and seemingly redundant level, the game is still immensely enjoyable. By marrying the developmental and partiality aspects inherent in RPGs with a strategically sound squad-based combat that comes driven by likeable and doable objectives, Freedom Force never strays from its course, and rarely even wavers.   In a nutshell, the game can be seen as Baldur's Gate combat in a 3D world with superheroes. After all, there is a limited party of characters to control (in this case four at any one time), and personal advancement is accomplished by acquiring experience and other points. But unlike that, one of the greatest RPGs of all time, Freedom Force is very linear, its maps are limited in size, and you must finish a mission before proceeding to the next. If you choose to perceive the game from this rigid RPG angle, it can come off as underdeveloped. But that's not how it should be seen. Freedom Force is more akin to, I  don't  know, something like MechCommander. Still, even if it's taken exclusively from this decidedly strategic standpoint, it can come off as underdeveloped... Well, how does the game manage to succeed then?   For starters, the interface is good. Although the mouse wheel refuses to be bound to speed/slow time and the thumb/middle button refuses to do anything, the interface only has one inconvenience of note: I could find no readily available map or radar. Sometimes it'd be nice to know the relative position of all your mates at a quick glance without having to scroll through the level to gauge how much distance really lies between them. I can see its inclusion as being especially useful in prioritizing objectives and seeking out secondary ones without inadvertently stumbling upon them unprepared, but I can't see its exclusion as doing anything but annoying.Quirky enemy AI can be a bit of a downer. Sometimes baddies will get stuck on structures or illogically wander about, attacking the wrong guys for the wrong reasons. Though the levels of AI that range from dinosaurs to thugs to whatever, all seem to differ. The more intelligent ones will prioritize weaker targets and will use the environment to their advantage, while the weaker ones will run away and/or confusingly attack anyone that attacks them first.Them running can be a bit of a pain, especially for characters like the poor Mentor, whose earlier attacks take sometime to initiate, thus providing villains ample time to escape. But this only means that you'll have to couple the attacks of the Freedom Force to be successful, especially in later missions as foes become far more resilient and cunning. Stun them first with a freedom missile and then move in for the kill. The rest is just logically picking the appropriate maneuver for the appropriate time, since your team thankfully never does much on its own, choosing what to do and how to do it is the crux of the title.     For what little it does wrong, FF manages to do an awful lot more right. The world is 3D, and can be effortlessly swung around, tilted, and zoomed in and out simply depressing the alt key and moving the mouse accordingly; buildings and trees will go transparent if they ever get in the way (this is actually an option). Actions themselves are accomplished by either left-clicking, which defaults to a primary action that you can set, or by right-clicking, which pauses time and opens up a small menu with options. Anything can be done from this right-click summoned popup menu that you can actually drag about the screen, making control that much easier and more intuitive. Other niceties include characters that can be selected and centered on in traditional RTS fashion (through the double-clicking of images, or double-tapping of numbers), and a clock that indicates at what rate game time is passing.Freedom Force allows for many degrees of fast-forward and slow-motion play. For the most part it's either stop or go. Slowing time instead of stopping it and then panning around your team is an awesome effect, but a shamefully unutilized one that isn't as readily accessible as it could have been (via the mouse wheel). As is, the spacebar that stops time is far more accessible than the plus and minus keys that slow and speed it up. The game does allow time levels to be bound to the spacebar (so on depression it would slow time instead of stopping it), but more often than not when you quickly hit space you want things to halt so you can tell what's going on, setting it any other way is then unadvised.Unlike a lot of other clear cut objective-based PC games, Freedom Force takes a cue from consoles. Instead of the more traditional MechWarrior type setup that sees a mission categorized into clearly outlined primary, secondary and tertiary objectives, but not everything is required for victory, Freedom Force's objectives are a bit more imperceptible. The only requirement is that the primary ones be completed -- doing the rest is still necessary to acquire more experience points with which to build up characters or import new ones. The thing is, the only way to know to do a secondary objective is to stumble across it. This adds a huge amount of replayability to the game, but detracts from the initial run through. No map and no plan means that sometimes just aimlessly walking about the level is the only way to find trouble that needs to be pummeled. That, in and of itself, isn't too bad; however, since most of this trouble comes in the form of scripted events (thugs beating on civilians) you have to be prepared to immediately fight, otherwise the script will play out and the objective will be failed if you cannot intervene in time.It's in the presentation where FF stands a cut above and beyond the rest. This game comes with a level of established and accessible customizability that we rarely see anymore. Irrational even went so far as to release the character creation tools months and months earlier. Because of this, already there are hundreds upon hundreds of new skins and heroes to choose from, lending to a nearly limitless experience. Because everything revolves around prestige points (values), all user created characters can be imported into the game and played through the single player campaign, provided you have enough prestige to purchase them, which you earn by successfully completing missions... We call this balance boys and girls. A novice player need only download or enter in a few skins, then make whatever character pleases him or her by simply augmenting powers and assigning others (there is such an enormous amount of ways that you can create your character that it's terrifyingly cool). Anything can be created, as strong or as weak as the creator sees fit. The stronger the character is, the more he'll cost. This way importing him into a game (single or multi) means ensuring that you either have enough prestige or that the match isn't capped. We call this more balance, boys and girls.Once more developed modifications begin to come down the pipe we're going to see some truly exceptional stuff. Already, what's available is amazing. Other developers need to take an Irrational note, and the rest of us need to start Irrationally applauding.If creation is not your forte, perhaps the uncanny amount of fanfare is? Detailed information and statistics on nearly every character in the game are provided for (right down to the attack animations and special effects). This level of detail is reminiscent of what used to be done in games like Freespace, where every ship model and piece of pertinent information on the universe was included and presented right there for access.All this comes drawn with rich, crisp coloring and very likable, well designed models. The thick lighting and overall design are dead on with the classic look that's constantly sought after. Hundreds and hundreds of interactive objects litter each and every playfield, which are themselves interactive. Buildings crumble, cars can be thrown, light posts can be swung, trees can be shattered, people walk the streets and can be injured, motorists crash, and so on, and so on. This interactive, moving world is truly remarkable and adds immeasurably to the game from both play and aesthetic standpoints. The effects of nearly every action are dazzling. Knock back a thug and he might bend backwards as he crashes through a bench. Charge El Diablo with setting ablaze a few pesky, oversized insects and his Inferno may inadvertently topple neighboring buildings and send nearby heroes into an unwelcome coma. Very, very slick.Irrational may not be able to boast all kinds of fancy vertex shading and bump-mapping effects, but the smooth, clean, crisp, and incredibly detailed environments and characters run well and exude liveliness and believability.Aurally the game is solid. Sound and music are of a very high and appropriate quality and the acting is very much like what we would all expect to emanate from those silver age comics of yesteryear. Only minor annoyances like dreadful overlapping sometimes mar the experience. Sound effects from an attack will also carry over into a paused state, meaning you could be stuck hearing a projectile beam's sound effect while you plan your next maneuver (something that should have been toned down).  What did you think of Freedom Force? Even though the multiplayer component allows for user-made stuff, it's very limited. More modes are definitely needed, though I suspect that they may be just on the horizon with patches and perhaps even add-on packs that are sure to come. Still, this is no real excuse to omit modes and options that had the potential of being some of the most enjoyable around. Even standards like UT's Domination or an assassination mode would have been stellar out-of-the-box.Freedom Force is, quite simply enough, a truly outstanding game. Despite miniscule setbacks in the areas of interface and artificial intelligence, it quickly becomes and then easily remains an incredibly enjoyable, fun, and involving adventure. In lovingly crafting a lighthearted, wholesome, but always comedic and laughable theme, Irrational has indulged the playful boys and girls inside all of us. Thank you, I say.The game's clever design and meticulously well-thought out, considerate presentation are accentuated by innovative gameplay that professionally melds the genres of RPG and strategy into a completely interactive and lively world. You get to blow all kinds of crap up. Being thrust into outrageous predicaments with loveable and distinct characters and then fighting for right and justice with supernatural powers that cause beautiful effects is just plain cool.I smiled as I played Freedom Force. I forgot what time it was, when my deadlines were due, and what my plans for the evening were. If you consider yourself a gamer and still can't find merriment, wonder, and staying power in this amazing title, then I pity your bitter, jaded, and gib soaked soul.", "date": "Mar 26, 2002"}
