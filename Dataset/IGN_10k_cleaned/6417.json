With all of the full-body interaction that's possible with the EyeToy, implementing it into a full fitness routine was a natural, and seemingly obvious, course of action. EyeToy: Kinetic offers up a full series of cardiovascular exercises, condition training and a number of other routines to help you get, or remain, in shape.   The two main modes revolve around a 12 week personal training program, for a more structured and pre-set program, or a custom routine where you can put together a set of your own exercises. When you create a profile, the game asks for your age, weight and height, as well as how often and much you currently exercise. From this, Kinetic will set the workout intensity to something that should be close to your ideal training level. With this, and the game's great instructional videos, the game does a great job of introducing beginners into their new workout regimen. It even includes a set of warmup and stretching videos for use before and after your workout, which is especially helpful for those who've never done much of this before.    One way that Kinetic definitely trumps workout tapes and other classic at-home workout materials is that the game keeps track of your progress and grades you on how well you're doing. You're able to look at performance graphs that show how you've been doing recently compared to your best outings and such, and the graded routines put a bit of pressure on you to try and complete the routine as well as possible. Kinetic does a pretty good job of conveying a sense of accomplishment, as the graphs and such are right there onscreen for you to see (assuming you're improving, of course).   One of the cool things about Kinetic is the basis from which it takes many of its exercises. While the floor-based stuff is of the general sit-up and crunch variety, many of the other full-body workouts are based on not only classic aerobic exercises but martial arts, yoga and more. For the most part, especially with regards to the cardio and mind & body workouts, the game features very fluid and natural workouts that feel more like a Tai Chi routine than a workout (Kinetic does happen to include an actual Tai Chi sequence, coincidentally). At the higher levels you can definitely work up a sweat, but it doesn't feel like you're working out, per se. As these exercises don't force you to push yourself while doing some boring and repetitive routine, it's likely to keep the interest of folks who generally would have no interest in exercising a fair bit longer than many other forms of exercise. That's not to say that you won't burn some fat and calories, because you will, but the workouts don't feel like as much of a burden as doing repeating sets up pushups, sit-ups and such.   The EyeToy ties into the game in that you'll be touching, punching, kicking or dodging various objects and symbols onscreen, which is how points and such are counted towards your progress. Some exercises are fairly passive, in that you'll just perform sweeping motions through a series of markers, while others will have you punching at objects floating around the screen in order to destroy them. Most of these sequences work pretty well, though the ones where you have to try and avoid objects while hitting others can take away from the pace a bit since you'll naturally slow down to become more precise to avoid the penalty objects. Aside from that, the sequences provide a nice way to work out while playing minigames of sorts on the screen that are ramped up depending on your workout level.    One thing to note about EyeToy: Kinetic is that, like with any form of exercise, you only get out of it what you put into it. You can cheat the ~game~, of course, but that doesn't do much good. We wouldn't expect many people to go out of their way to do this, but even if you don't intend to cheat you might not be using the program to its fullest. Many of the exercises encourage you to use your legs and feet to kick at objects low on the screen, but it's more natural (and hence, easier) to reach down and hit them with your arms, so you'll probably find that you tend to do so. It would have been nice to see the objects intended for your feet or legs displayed as a different color or symbol, simply to help those who really want to make full use of the programs.EyeToy: Kinetic is a very nifty exercise package that makes great use of the EyeToy. It's not quite perfect, as dodging some objects may slow down the pace, and you might not tend to use your legs like Kinetic may intend, but regardless of that it's an impressive exercise package. It's more involving than a workout video, to be sure, so newcomers to home workouts may stick with it longer. It still won't work as well as a personal trainer, or maybe even live classes, but it's a great home option.", "date": "Nov 23, 2005"}
