While many consider wrestlers to be better actors than they are athletes, nobody can deny the fact that the sport is extremely entertaining.   It also comes as no surprise that numerous wrestling videogames have appeared on various home and arcade systems over the years, most of which were disappointing and entirely uninteresting. THQ's WCW Vs. NWO: World Tour, however, comes as a refreshing change for many reasons.  The facts WCW Vs. NWO includes more than 40 wrestlers, many of which are secretly hidden. The game also has five different modes of gameplay (including WCW Vs. NWO, Exhibition, League Challenge, League, and Tournament), ring-outs, cheating, and a ton of different moves per character. In addition to all that, players also can fight it out in a four-player battle royal, go two-on-two or even three-on-one. Unfortunately, there is no make your own belt mode, as was previously advertised.  Some of the wrestlers featured include: Lex Luger, Sting, Hollywood Hogan, The Giant, Ric Flair, The Outsiders, The Steiner Brothers, Syxx, Dean Malenko, Eddy Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Scott Norton, Steven Regal, Rey Mysterio, Jr, Ultimo Dragon, Buff Bagwell, and Eric Bischell.   Unlike some wrestling games of the past which utilize sprite-based graphics engines, WCW Vs. NWO puts a 3D polygonal engine to use. In doing so wrestlers take on a whole new realism that simply wasn't possible with 2D sprites; wrestlers now animate believably, multiple camera angles are put to use (including zoom-in and zoom-outs), and wrestlers finally look as if they are really touching one-another. Also, they have a full, 3D look to them now -- from any angle. The polygonal engine is far from perfect, however, as multiple clipping and collision detection glitches are visible when wrestlers go through various maneuvers. For example, every so often the camera will change angles on the action and one of the wrestler's hands will become visible through the body of an opponent. It's ugly, but it's not unbearable. And while wrestlers do resemble who they are supposed to be, their faces aren't picture perfect as they could be with sprites.   Close-ups reveal blank faces that stare into space. Wait a minute, maybe THQ was going for realism. Joking aside, the crowd outside the arena is the ugliest part about the game. It animates, but it only looks like a moving pile of mesh.   What saves the game from becoming just another under-delivering wrestler is its gameplay (especially in multiplayer mode). A plethora of moves are available to each wrestler, some standard and some unique, all of which can be performed at different times and to varying degrees. Holding the A button for two seconds and then releasing wields a stronger blow to opponents than quickly pressing A. This works for a handful of different moves (using different buttons), giving players the chance to use more power in certain situations and less power in others.   Each wrestler comes equipped with his own pros and cons. Saladin, at 6'3~, 330 lbs, is slower than Eric Bischoff, who is only 6'0~, 185 lbs, but Saladin is much stronger up-close. Bischoff must rely on speed and quick wits. Ring-outs also play a major factor in the game; wrestlers can be thrown out, pulled in, bounced off the ropes, thrown through the ropes and so on. Everything works quite well, despite some instinctive button mashing and slow-moving wrestlers at times.  Some of the trademark moves available include: Belly to back suplex, Regal Stretch, Scorpion Death Lock, Canadian Backbreaker, Top Rope Outsider's Edge, Shoulder Breaker, Power Bomb, Torture Rack, Hurricanrana Pin, Figure Four Leg Lock, Flying Knee Drop, Cryonic Kick, Jackknife Power Bomb and the Choke Slam -- and that's only a very small percentage of what's at the player's disposal.  Multiplayer mode is a lot of fun. Imagine four wrestlers in a ring full of anarchy. Opponents jumping off the ropes, performing special moves and even teaming up on one-another. Once an enemy has been pinned, he is banished outside of the ring where he awaits the chance to grab the heels of wrestlers inside the ring, pull them out and give them the beating of their lives. Chairs and other objects can even be obtained from the crowd. Though many of the editors at IGN aren't big wrestling fans, we found ourselves coming back again and again. If you even moderately enjoy wrestling but love multiplayer gaming, we don't see how you could go wrong with this game.  Rumble Pak support is included. The Pak shakes and buzzes as players are hit, thrown around, or what have you. It's put to typical use, but it works nicely for added effect. Another short-coming lies in the game's sound department. As each round begins wrestler's aren't even announced via voice samples, but are zoomed in on where the crowd cheers. It's cheesy. Some average guitar samples play through-out each match, but you won't find anything special in this cart for your ears.If you don't like wrestling there's no point to this game. Despite some ugly graphic glitches and below average sound, though, if you enjoy wrestling then you'll probably be thrilled. All of your favorite wrestlers are here in 3D polygonal form and are equipped with a major arsenal of moves and -- believe it or not, this game is a lot of fun. The multiplayer mode alone is enough for us to recommend this game to holiday shoppers.", "date": "Dec 10, 1997"}
