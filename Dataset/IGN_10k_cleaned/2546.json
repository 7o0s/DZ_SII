Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, the first four-player co-op title on the system, draws on the past Gauntlets and brings you everything fans of the series would expect and more. In the end, though, it is only an improved Gauntlet and not an improved game by today's standards. Lacking depth and any sort of compelling single-player elements, Dark Legacy falls very short of the mark.   Features  A simple, yet effective hack-and-slash experience Choose from wizard, knight, dwarf, archer, wizard, jester, sorceress, valkyrie, and warrior Updated GameCube inventory system lets gamers turn pick-ups and power-ups on and off during play New GameCube power-ups such as health amulet, mikey potion, hand of death, and more Huge worlds revolving around mountain, desert, forest, and castle including backdrops of ice, town, forest, and others Each character can gain experience and engage in combo attacks and turbo moves One to four player cooperative action   Gameplay Gauntlet is a self-proclaimed hack-and-slash. It's a simple setup where you and up to three friends can get together for some button-mashing. You begin by choosing your character type: wizard, knight, dwarf, archer, wizard, jester, sorceress, or valkyrie. All of them can be customized according to color to make it a little easier to identify one player from another. They're all balanced pretty fairly, drawing on strength, armor, magic, and speed, so you can come up with good teams if playing with friends. Once you've got all that sorted out you can jump right into the action in the first level. Enemies will relentlessly flow from nearby spawning points, which give you and your friends plenty to hack at.   There are a few puzzles thrown in for good measure and even larger, mini-boss and boss type characters to keep you on your toes. You'll even be required to cast a spell or two now and then. This is pretty much all there is to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, unfortunately. It's extremely shallow and can become daunting and boring quite quickly because of that. Midway obviously wasn't trying to fool anybody into thinking that Gauntlet is suddenly a deep action RPG, but therein lies the problem. Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is meant to bring all that great quarter-popping action of the arcades to your fingertips at home. Gather four of your friends up and just go all-out without the worry of spending money, right?   The problem here is that once the arcade element of popping quarters or fearing a limit is gone, the lack of gameplay depth becomes instantly apparent. It's like a food buffet (a cheap one). You get there and just gorge yourself on everything. Soon you're feeling the consequences; bloated and dreary eyed you pay your bill and move on. Dark Legacy creates a similar effect. After even 20 minutes (possibly more if you're into hack-and-slash) or so you will begin to grow tired of playing.   The ghosts may look scary, but they die quickly.  There's no debate that Dark Legacy is the deepest Gauntlet yet (even improved over the PS2 version released last year). Levels are much more complex and the magic system is vastly improved over the original arcade Gauntlets. But it all leads to the same focal point: hack, slash, and repeat. In addition to its shallow nature, Dark Legacy has some major issues that hardcore gamers won't soon forgive. The one-dimensional offering has downright brainless AI. Yes, it can be amusing to lead zombies into a fire to watch them burn themselves, but it's also disappointing to see such stupid AI on each and every opponent. Enemies constantly get caught behind objects and do nothing remotely intelligent, creating a very uninteresting and ultimately not challenging environment. You don't take damage because the game is difficult or the AI is smart -- you take damage because you lose interest and just plough through the enemy lines.  In the end, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is a fun four-player romp that you'll want to experience only a bit at a time. Less demanding gamers will get a kick out of its intuitive setup, but those in the hardcore bunch will tire of its simplicity promptly.    Graphics Dark Legacy visuals could best be described as ~blech.~ Yes, we know it's not a word, but it's what you say often when viewing the game. Truly it looks just a shade better than some high-res N64 games we've seen. There are a number of problems that contribute to this. Namely, the art design is really off balance. Low polygon characters are dressed in vibrant, monotone garb while the rest of the world features a wide array of blurry texture work. Meanwhile, it's doing all this at 30 frames per second. It's true, the framerate is mostly constant but it chops up now and then in both single and multiplayer. Oddly enough, the first area you step into -- the portal area -- upon beginning your quest has major framerate troubles.   It just goes to show how badly optimized the engine is. In fact, overall, the graphics engine is very sloppy. Where most engines cleverly use Z-buffering to save polygons for unseen objects and walls, Dark Legacy uses it very... chaotically. Due to the top-down view you can usually see the rear side of objects, yet for some reason the game engine will randomly decide not to draw them in at times. It's nothing that interferes with gameplay, but for graphic nitpickers like us it is annoying.   Furthermore, animations and particle effects are decidedly substandard. Some of the larger characters, which are intended to be frightening, animate with so few frames of animation it tends to look like a slide show or CPU slowdown. These are just a few of the many visual evils of Dark Legacy, and we're not even mentioning the muddy FMV sequences.   Sound Let's face it. All we want in Gauntlet games is the voice! That deep, intestine-shaking voice that tells you want to do, when to do it, and is always there to let you know when it's ~GAME OVER!~ or when you need ~food, badly!~  This, fortunately, is in full effect as you quest through Midway's classic hack-and-slash. The voice can stay. We've no problems with it.   Collect the jewels. The voice orders you to do it!  The sound effects and soundtrack, however, are nothing too inspiring. It's all there to do only what it has to. But, you'll notice that many of the sound effects are compressed. You'd swear Midway forgot it was working on a 1.5GB disc. It's not a total lackluster effort, though. Compositions are catchy enough and there's even some queues for audio crossfades when you enter differently themed areas.   It's no secret that Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is a pure, mindless hack-and-slash. Midway intentionally designed it to be very simple -- and they've accomplished this in buckets. However, this does not forgive its shallowness. When you're popping quarters at the arcade on Gauntlet machines, you experience this lack of depth in very small doses. At home it's an entirely different thing. As a single-player experience it's rare to want to play it for more than 20 or so minutes straight through. It gets better if you have three friends to play with, but only marginally. In four-player mode there are some camera issues that lead to constantly getting stuck behind items as your friends push forward. Then you have to backtrack to let them out from behind a tree or whatever. That's about all that will keep you on your toes -- but only for so long. Eventually get into a very autopilot type state of mind as you hack and slash your way forward, collecting anything that blinks. Another huge problem for Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is that videogames are subjective. They cannot stand alone on their own merits because there are other developers out there pushing the envelope. I've spent plenty of time with a fine title by the name of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. It has all the depth and polish you could want. It doesn't do anything new, but what it does do it does very well. It's something that can be enjoyed in both single-player and multiplayer thanks to deeper gameplay mechanics. Yes, it's meant to have more RPG elements, but I think that's exactly what the Gauntlet series needs if it hopes to stand on its own in the home console market. All said and done, Dark Legacy is the type of title you want to rent. If you and three of your friends are looking for something you can pass some time with, head out and rent Dark Legacy. But, unless you're looking for a totally mindless single-player experience -- and there are plenty hours of it -- keep away from purchasing this one.", "date": "Mar 11, 2002"}
