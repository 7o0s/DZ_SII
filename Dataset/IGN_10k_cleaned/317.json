{"name": "Demolition Racer", "name_review": "Demolition Racer", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/15/demolition-racer", "text": "There's good reason to initially mistake Infogrames' Demolition Racer as a sequel to Sony's Destruction Derby series. Members of the Derby team have indeed teamed up with Pitbull Syndicate to bring us another crash-em-up driving game. Pitbull, of course, knows a little about cars. It's the brains behind Test Drive 4 & 5, two of the best-selling racers of all-time.  Gameplay Though it has some holes, Demolition Racer doesn't lack in the variety department. You're given three options from the get-go: single race, demolition league and two-player mode. When opting for a single race, you can choose among the following: demolition, chase, chicken, last man standing and suicide. Under the demolition league, you have your choice of five circuits: rookie, semi pro, pro, endurance and arena. Unfortunately, most vehicles, tracks and circuits are locked, so the options and my ability to fully review this game are very limited. Your objective is to win, win, win. Only then will you unlock all the secrets.   Easier said than done. DR is one of the toughest racing games to date. Finishing first is as complicated as winning a NASCAR event against Jeff Gordon. I mean, your car has to place, damage the competition and survive a beating from both the track and aggressive drivers.   During single race mode, the only playable circuits are Last Man Standing and, to no one's surprise, Demolition. The underlying goal of both races is the same, but getting there is another story.   Last Man Standing is just a nicer, less violent name for suicide. Sixteen cars attempt to destroy each other in a circular arena, until there's only one left. It's like those monster truck events you may have seen on TV or in person, minus the trucks. A must for taking out your daily aggressions.   Demolition mode has yet another sub-directory of circuits, but only four of the possible 10 are playable when you initially enter its realm of pain. After a few hours of speeding around the courses and breaking a few fingers, this gamer believes Demolition should be called ~The Practice,~ just like that TV show by David E. whomever. My reason -- even after finishing first, which is a rare feat, you don't get a cookie. It was extremely frustrating to see the main menu pop up instead of ~Congratulations, you've just unlocked another track!~ Why do the people at Pitbull Syndicate tease us so? Don't mislead us with a hard-core nomenclature like Demolition, when in reality, it's merely an Exhibition or Test-Run for the various Leagues... Wow! I didn't know I could be so harsh. Well, t.s. for them.   In a perfect world, after sharpening your skills on the practice tracks, your mission is to enter the aforementioned League. Win the rookie circuit and move on to the semi-pros and the pros, gaining access to new courses along the way and collecting money to buy new cars. For those who drool over Last Man Standing, try the Arena League. Same rules apply, but this time, you'll get cookies for performance.  Controls It's always difficult to rate control in racers. Sensitivity is good, but too much can result in arduous driving. Too little often removes any sense of realism. Only a few games have ever reached the ~sensitivity equilibrium.~ DR doesn't quite make the cut. I must say the physics of each car is above average, giving spot control, but if you brake a little too long into a turn, your car flips or performs some funky move, like landing on top of another vehicle. Some may consider the physics to be life-like, but to me, it's an artificial attempt to make DR a wild ride.   It's much easier to develop a pure racing game, like Cruis'n USA, or one of mass destruction, like Twisted Metal. DR tries to combine both qualities into one neat package, but the results are less than impressive.  Graphics Graphic detail and representation in this game are good. Individual vehicles are crafted carefully, and break apart just as well. Witnessing the damage you've done is a rewarding experience. It's also the best feature of Demolition Racer. Cars visibly take hits and wear down progressively as the race continues. Hoods, tires, bumpers and other bits fly off your vehicle, while larger car parts litter the road. The jumps off cliffs look really cool and watching your opponents crash into each other is refreshing.   Other special effects include smoke, flying particles and cars lying dead on the road like burnt cadavers. My personal favorite is the burning engine, where three to four-foot flames rise in front of your car's windshield, blocking any view of what's ahead. Caution: if you see flames, you're car will explode in due time. Try not to bump into anything.  Sound Learn to press the circle button. That would be the horn, a driver's best friend... Wait a minute. There's no need to warn others when you're about to crush 'em. In that case, blow the horn after you hit em. It's more fun that way, though somewhat annoying to the ear.   You'd expect better sound effects from a game titled Demolition Racer. At this point, I'm not surprised. Effects are under par compared to other driving games, and since this isn't golf, that's not a plus. Screeching tires and growling engines are tough, and almost impossible, to improve upon in this industry.   The only highlight here is a booming soundtrack featuring original music by Fear Factory and Empirion. Yes, that means the bands sat down in their studio to create music just for Demolition Racer. FYI- the soundtrack is brought to you by the letter ~T,~ for Tommy Tallarico Studios.  Without being too descriptive, let me get to the point. I found this game to be too difficult. While that helps increase lasting appeal, it also frustrates the crap out of people like me. I want to see all the tracks and vehicles without putting in a cheat code. Sure, I'm a fan of hidden characters and surprises, but that's the problem with this game-- there are no surprises. The menu already displays all the circuits and cars, but most have a big red ~LOCKED~ stamp on em. Show me three cars and two tracks. That's all I need to see. Anything else I get is a bonus. Please don't tease us with 10 cars, saying, ~Sorry, Johnny. You can only have two of the ten right now, but if you eat your vegetables, you'll get some more.~ C'mon. On the bright side, I enjoyed the little film strip introduction as well as the soundtrack. Headbanging music is fitting for Demolition Racer's daring gameplay, but that isn't a good enough reason to buy the game. I would rate this as a 2-day rental, not a keeper.", "date": "Oct 15, 1999"}
