On the PlayStation last year, Backstreet Billiards overtook VR Pool with a phenomenally detailed, finely tuned game of pool that played better than anything before it.  Now Mirage and THQ have chalked their sticks up to take down the new king with Ultimate 8 Ball. In this slick package, THQ brings gamers a superb set of pool games (more than any title before it), a great training package, and a colorful set of characters from which to choose. Ultimate 8 Ball has 14 different games packed in for pool fans to dig into, and gives them the tools - i.e. spins, English, airborne shots, et al - to compete with all takers.  Gameplay Right off the bat, players will notice the superb selection of games from which to play. In all, there are 14 different pool games. Players can take on the computer, one another, or up to 15 players in turn-based competition, a nice little feature, if 15 or so of your friends are just sitting around (what are the chances of that?). The game includes 8 ball (US or UK versions), 9 ball, 10 ball, 6 ball, 3 ball, and Straight pool, Speed pool, and Rotation. Then there's Killer, 1 Pocket, Bank Pool, 10 Pin, and Cutthroat.    Later in the game, players will notice that not only does the competition get weird, with oddball names and outfits, but the pool tables themselves take on different shapes.  L shapes, diamonds, and other variations create a new kind of fun, especially for players who have tired of the standard table fare. What's better for experienced players on the special shaped tables is that their practice can pays off big time. Knowledge of special spins and jumps pay off extremely favorably, and these moves aren't likely to be emulated by your computer opponents.   The ball physics are especially good. There's no question about it, Ultimate 8 Ball's physics top those in Backstreet Billiards. The spins, speed, and rebounding effects of each ball are amazingly realistic. They continue the speed with which they're hit, and bounce off each wall or oncoming ball with alarming precision. It's simply amazing to watch a player break.   Ultimate 8 Ball can be played with either the analog or digital controls, each of which provides a nice touch in control. Overall the control is decent, though it could be better. The character arm follows the direction you choose and doesn't cheat on close balls by simply moving right through them. The biggest problem with control, however, is the loose feel and the not-so-subtle alterations. If I want to move the stick just a tad to the left or to the right, or make a minute change, the stick always moves too far. It's worse with the dual analog sticks, too. Backstreet Billiards uses a far more complex aiming system, and it's preferable over Ultimate 8 Ball's system.   While load screens are quick and better than most, I have found that the time in between shots - in all pool games - is tedious. Ultimate 8 Ball is no exception. Waiting for the other pool player to shoot shouldn't be realistic, it should be quick, so you can get right back to playing.  Last but not least, the training mode is the best I have ever played. It's so thorough that anybody who plays through it - despite his or her previous ability in pool - has a superb chance of competing with the best in this game. First there are basic shots (or Basic Potting), Positional Potting, or Advanced Shots. Each of these subsections delivers a textural description, a video of a computer player performing the shot, and then provides a chance for you to take the shot, with infinite retries. It's very helpful, and well designed.  Graphics Ultimate 8 Ball is not necessarily the best looking game on the system, but it's not the worst either. What's noticeable is its darkness. The backgrounds, rooms, and most of the characters are all on the dark side of the palette, with lots of Gouraud shading, and a simple overall design. Sure, pool halls are dark, but does that mean it has to feel so dark? Must everything be shady and dim? Still, the game is about pool and Ultimate 8 Ball doesn't miss on its one-time opportunity to make a good-looking pool table or oddly dressed character. In fact, the pool tables are weirdly textured, with stripes, checkers, argyle, and a ton of other weird patterns that, well, are exciting, for pool games.   Another noticeable graphic touch are the characters, who in their own ~special~ way take on a life of their own. With names such as Wipeout, Boomer, Ed Case, Chopper, Sayonara Kid, Idoru and Slim Chance, they also dress to their stereotype. I particularly liked the final character, which I can't give away since it's a spoiler, but he is, nonetheless, my kind of guy. Let's just say he's a very evil kind of red-caped, horned fellow. And this particular final boss not only shoots a mean game of pool, he's so good he hovers.  Sound As with most pool games, the basic sounds in pool consist of balls hitting one another, balls falling down holes, and entertain you with different styles of background music. After the excellent set of sound effects (not a terribly difficult goal to achieve), the music could - in this genre - really set it aside with something different. OK, at least the music could be broad, appealing to many different folks. Or at least it could be catchy. Unfortunately, the music here isn't good enough to make the top 10 Elevator Muzak list. The phenomenally generic selection songs were not well thought out and become annoying within a matter of minutes. Worse, players can't chance the music as in most games in the Options screen. That's a shame. I recommend turning the music off altogether.For pool lovers everywhere, Ultimate 8 Ball does a number of things well, though it's not a perfect game. The control could be much better, and that's a big deal when it comes to pool. Backstreet Billiards is better. It's far more precise, and that's what you want in a game. Not to say this one is bad, it's not, it's just not the best available in terms of control.On the other hand, those who love variation and great tables, well, this game is for you. In each area, Ultimate 8 Ball is a champ, with loads of each. And the best aspect of the game is its physics. You'll want to simply watch the balls do their thing shot after shot. Ultimate 8 Ball is a solid, well-designed pool game that excels in certain areas. It's doesn't knock off the champ, but it's damn good.", "date": "Jun 22, 1999"}
