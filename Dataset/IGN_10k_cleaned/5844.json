(Good old games get the good old sayings.)  The collection is comprised of three games originally introduced in the arcades in the early 1990s: Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition, and Street Fighter II: Turbo.  The funny thing here is that the three really are a lot alike. Almost identical in today's views. Each represents Capcom's old (and new) arcade strategy, which is to make lots of games, but take little steps each time. Actually, the changes were quite significant then and added much to look forward to, though they would look nearly insignificant today.  Street Fighter II brought in a significant new level of 2D fighting gameplay over Street Fighter that headed off the fighting genre forever. Championship Edition enabled you to play the bosses from Street Fighter II, permitted same player versus same player, and introduced new outfit colors for similar characters. Turbo had new moves, better balance, faster gameplay, and new background and costume colors. The three games in this collection represent an exciting period in fighting game history, and for many, they spark strong emotional responses. At least for many people around the IGN office, the early Street Fighter II series was a major part of our childhood.  The games are all one- to two-player, just as they were in the arcades, and this time around, the biggest difference is in the load times, simple no-no's in the arcades, but an unfortunate necessity with the PlayStation's limited system RAM. The load times are the most annoying aspects of the game. They appear in the beginning of the game, in between the choice of the three games, and in between just about everything else, except the gameplay itself.  The characters are all too familiar, and include Ryu, Blanka, E. Honda, Guile, Dhalsim, Ken, Chun-Li, Vega, Zangief, Sagat, Balrog, and M. Bison. As in the arcade version of Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, when you finish off the first eight characters, you play against the three sub-bosses Balrog, Vega, and Sagat, and then face M. Bison for the final fight.  With the expected change of added load times, these games have made their journey in pure form to the PlayStation. They are excellent, straight no-nonsense ports, and a hell of a lot of fun to play. Players have a choice of jumping into Arcade mode (open fighting like in the arcade, in which anyone can jump in after a bout and a story is told); Versus mode (straight head-to-head fighting with a choice of handicaps, stage select, and a listing of a win/loss result table); or they can take a practice session in training, which enables just that.  Gamers will also find that a ~Collection~ feature has been included, which enables you to look at various forms of artwork of each of your favorite characters.  Lastly, although the box says that the game is analog control compatible, we can confirm that it is not. It's a misprint that was missed by both Capcom and Sony, who are both to blame. But don't worry, the game is dual shock compatible, and impressively so. Massive rumbles will buzz through your controller with most hits, and after your get the sh@t beaten out of you, too.I have only a few words for this one, and they are all good. Street Fighter fans will absolutely love this, and I can't think of any other 2D fighter (other than Alpha 2) that I would rather play (Street Fighter Alpha 3 also will probably be another exception, but it's not out yet.) Straight non-Street Fighter gamers will love it, too, because it's the real thing, the origin from which today's fighting genre bloomed, and it's all skill-based fighting. You have to know your stuff to beat anyone in these games.I like this better than any of the Dark Stalker games, better than Guilty Gear, or King of Fighters, and it beats the smack out of Mortal Kombat  in any of its 2D forms. (And no I'm not getting any payola from Capcom. I never do! Damn!)For me, this is pure gaming goodness. It's old school, but it's a must have.", "date": "Nov 25, 1998"}
