{"name": "The Lion King", "name_review": "The Lion King", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/31/the-lion-king", "text": "There was a time when Disney's animated movies broke box office records. ~The Lion King,~ Disney's African-themed Shakespearean drama involving possible patricide, issues of self-worth and destiny, and farting warthogs was a blockbuster, raking in ~Finding Nemo~ dollars before Pixar muscled into the scene. (Talk about your Trojan horses, too -- Disney's distribution deal with Pixar is what ended up killing them in the end.)   Now, Disney Mobile has brought a platformer based on the classic film to cellphones, timed to the release of the original on a special edition DVD and the ~Lion King 1.5~ kinda-sequel. Perhaps your money is better spent on those?   Features:  Action game  Fight off hyenas   Considering the incredible cast of the movie and all the opportunities for interaction what a titanic disappointment it is to realize, five minutes into Lion King, that the game is little more than running and jumping over hazards. No jungle combat, no nothing. Run and jump. Jump over pits. Jump over stones. Avoid bees. Zzzzz.   In case this is just too complicated for you to handle, Zazu (the bird voiced by Rowan Atkinson) is on hand to help you along. Chances are, though, you'll have no use for your feathered friend as reaching the top of the mountain and reclaiming your throne is about as easy as deleting the game off your phone.   Now, we weren't expecting something like the Genesis game on our handsets, but c'mon. Considering the considerable advancements in mobile games over the last year, who dropped the ball on this one? Very limited frames of animation. Poor audio. Why do this to your fans, Disney Mobile?  Should you download Lion King? No. No. Again, no. There far too many better games available on your carrier's deck to waste a few bucks on this exercise in collision avoidance. These are the kinds of games that give licensed content a bad name. Everything about this game screams lackluster. Actually, it doesn't scream. It whimpers. It should be put to sleep.", "date": "Mar 31, 2004"}
