Ahh wrestling, you've come such a long way in the videogame world. WCW/NWO Thunder makes one think how lucky we are to play the faster, better looking games of 1999. And yet, despite the improved look and feel of Inland's effort over its predecessor Nitro, THQ's last WCW/NWO Thunder comes across as an old-fashioned arcade title with little innovation, verve, or arcade simplicity.  What? How could that be? (How could we say anything to disturb the greatness of the wrestling world?) Well, before diving hard onto the mat to explore its fabric up close let's the look at the whole picture.   Thunder will please many a wrestling fan. It explores the fanaticism of wrestling with extra energy and detail. Packed with a handful of play modes, ranging from a world (or US) Heavyweight Championship to Tag Team play to Battle Royal and Cage Matches, Thunder mimics the cable TV show to a tee. Fans of the show can explore nearly every aspect of the TV show's eccentricities with abandon. In either one- to two-player modes, you can pick up to 32 regular wrestlers with whom to rage (and 32 more to open up, totaling 64 in all). There are 11 total modes from which to choose.   Inland's effort gets the feel of the game right, too. Everywhere you look, the game is adorned with the right paraphernalia and fanfare. Fans throw garbage and scream the appropriate (inappropriate?) support or scorn. From a moving (albeit crude looking) crowd that chants and howls out wrestlers' names, to the intro music for each wrestler and the correct (and changeable) affiliations, the title looks and feels damn near just like the TV event. The official WCW announcers Tony Schiavone and Mike Tenay are there to fill you in on each and every move, throw, and pin.   Graphically, Inland has key-framed each character's movement with painstaking skill, while managing to keep a solid frame rate and character speed. Players can change affiliation (NWO black and white, WCW, Raven's Flock, and NWO red and black, the wolf pack) which alters the wrestler's outfit as well, so they will appear in their various outfits, depending on your affiliation preference. A lot of attention has been paid to the actual arenas, and if you're a fan you can tell the differences. You'll see all sorts of arenas, such as the Cow Palace for instance, and the Pay-per-view gala is all there for your visual pleasure.   Topping off the game's decent looks are the classic hard-hitting full-motion video scenes or wrestlers pulling off signature moves and screams, and a whole lot of primal yells for good measure. They appear in the game's beginning, and before matches, but Inland added a little luscious cameo for each wrestler at the selection screen that's to die for. When selecting, press circle to access a little video of each character telling you why to choose them. For a good laugh, check Kevin Nash (who tells you NOT to choose him), or Konnan, who's an absolute scream.   WCW/NWO is not analog compatible, but it does support the dual shock feature, when in any mode. Well, that sounds like a rather good review, doesn't it? Well, looking past the presentation, the glitz, and overall feel, the gameplay is amazingly plain. Each player shares a handful of shared moves, but retain a dissatisfyingly short list of individual moves. Inland did creative signature moves for each wrestler, but just not that many. So, I could probably deal with that without too many painkillers, but pulling off the moves themselves is as difficult as a thumbless carpenter removing cancer from a frog. The simplest of moves, such as a suplex, are unintuitive as all get out (a hypothetical move for example is triangle, up down, square, up left, etc.), requiring you need to memorize each one, or even write them down. Actually, most of the moves are all written down in the manual. Yeah, the game is deep in presentation, and it's an improvement over its predecessor Nitro, with better frame rates, and more gameplay modes, but it's still not the large step I was hoping for. Despite the game's fast-moving players, they don't move realistically, and the human feel of each is terribly stunted. The physics aren't nealy as good as those seen in WWF Warzone.In an overall sense, Thunder's predecessor Nitro is actually a slightly better game. Thunder succeeds in making wrestling the carnival event it should be in perfect detail, but it fails in taking the game anywhere new, or achieving a better playing game. It's kind of a fluke really, but the game isn't that fun. Having said that, I'm sure that Thunder will sell through the roof and most fans will be happy. What an irony.
