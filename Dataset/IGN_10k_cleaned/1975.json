The game (known as WaiWai Racing overseas) was one of the most complete titles at the show, but it was going up against Nintendo's own Mario Kart Advance in a separate set of system kiosks. The game was and is great in its own right, but it was physically overshadowed by the presence of Nintendo's own remake. And I'm sure Konami is thanking the GBA stars for Nintendo's delaying of Mario Kart Advance until a two months after the system launch -- Krazy Racers is a lot of fun on the Game Boy Advance...it's just no substitute for the game it's trying to clone.   Features Eight racers 16 tracks Link cable support for two players (unofficial four-player support) Battery back-up Only for Game Boy Advance  Konami's take on the character go-kart racing genre follows the formula right down to the letter. The company's been around long enough to build up a decent line-up of characters and titles to spawn a racing series off of, and Krazy Racers is the result. All the characters, tracks, and most of the background music tunes are based around existing Konami games...and many of you probably won't recognize half of these guys since they're ripped out of titles that were only popular in Japan or Europe. Eight members fill Konami's team of racers. You've got Dracula from Castlevania, and Goemon from Mystical Ninja, as well as the Ninja from Metal Gear Solid and Moai, the stone head from Gradius. Then we get to the more obsure: Takesuke from Parodius, Pastel from Twin Bee, Nyami the Cat from Pop'n Music, and even a big-headed player from Jikkyo Power Pro Baseball.  Like all kart racing games, it's not just about scooting around the arenas at top speed...it's also about humiliating your opponents with power-ups. Collecting Parodius bells will set the power-up meter spinning, and randomly you'll be awarded items including speed boosts, invisibility, a time bomb, a portable hole, missiles (both homing and straight), lightning, and the ever-embarrasing ~turn everyone into a pig~ power-up. If you don't use these items, there's really no way to win -- so you'll have to be both quick at the wheel and on the pick-ups. Krazy Racers also has several multiplayer modes for gamers lucky enough to snag the link cable and another copy of the game. As many as four players can race against each other, or battle in an enclosed arena. The battle mode is very different from the one in Mario Kart, as it's more of a game of tag -- players try and ram into each other in order to give them a bomb. The player with the bomb when it explodes is the loser. There's also a simple game of ~chicken~, where players try to get as close to a cliff's edge without falling off. These games are also available in single-player mode, but obviously once you get other people involved, it's a whole different game.  Note: don't let the game manual fool you -- the US version of Krazy Racers is identical in every way (except language) as the Japanese version. The manual states that it's a two player link game, but it will allow for as many as four players, but at a cost...the game will play more slowly and have a tendency to glitch and lock-up when three or four players are connected. Two players, the link is flawless.  Krazy Racers is a shameless clone of Mario Kart nearly down to its core -- which is a good thing, considering the controls are extremely tight and user-friendly. The graphics are also extremely similar, utilizing the system hardware and its Mode 7-style 3D effects for the track layout. The game does suffer from an overall ~choppy~ look, especially when compared to the ultra-smooth F-Zero: Maximum Velocity...but Konami's racer is still very playable at its lower framerate. Other than the WaiWai themesong at power-up (which won't make sense to the US gamers, since the game is now called Krazy Racers) is the only real audio treat -- the rest of the tunes could have been ripped out of the Game Boy Color...Tony Hawk and Iridion 3D this is not.   The real problem in Krazy Racers comes down to the lack of familiar characterizations and charm -- for the US, at least. Many gamers aren't going to get the references that Krazy Racers is structured around. It's fun to drive around the Metal Gear Solid-based levels, complete with crates and the familiar MGS theme song, but who's going to figure out that a couple tracks are based on Pop'n Twinbee? Konami has put together a very tight kart racing package on the Game Boy Advance. I really dig Krazy Racers, but it's not a replacement for the real thing -- it'll definitely hold you over until Nintendo releases Mario Kart Advance, but if you only want one, keep your cash in your pockets for a just a couple months more.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
