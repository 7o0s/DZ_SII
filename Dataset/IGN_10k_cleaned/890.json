Tal suggested I grab an SUV, drive to a middle school league soccer game and chat it up with some soccer moms to get into the mood. I ended up settling with burning scented aromatherapy candles and listening to Enya while I played.   The Legend of Lotus Spring is an adventure game, pure and simple. Developed by Women Wise, a company which creates its games with an all female team, the game (and the company) aims to ~produce titles which serve the interests and needs of women.~ While some male gamers would rather gouge out their eyes than play a game ~created by women for women,~ they'd have to admit that there is a growing market for female gamers, both young and old. Women Wise, and their publisher Dreamcatcher games, hopes to capitalize on that.   The sad part here, as you will soon see, is that in the quest to make a game suitable and enjoyable to a more softcore female demographic, The Legend of Lotus Spring suffers in its intelligence and quality.   I'd make an attempt at explaining the story, but even after reading through the plot I'm still a bit cloudy about the whole idea behind the game. Apparently, you play the role of forbidden lover to a beautiful woman named Lotus Spring. This all takes place in, as you can probably guess, an asian backdrop. Your goal is to learn the legend of the Lotus Spring by collecting six items and writing in your ~dream diary~ by watching CGI movies of Lotus Spring and her lover (No, not those kinds of movies). If that isn't creepy enough for you, the actual cursor is a fat little China Doll. All of this is done by jumping from puzzle to puzzle, each of which is more simple than the last. For once, I'm not exaggerating when I say, ~I've finally found a game my mom could beat.~   The graphics in The Legend of Lotus Spring are odd. Sometimes they come off looking a bit amateur and uninspired, and other times they surprise you with their great quality (although, this is a rare occurrence). One feature that The Legend of Lotus Spring is noticeably lacking is the 360 degree panning of Quicktime VR found in some other adventures by Dreamcatcher Games, such as The Crystal Key. This time around, they chose a slideshow style of movement, jumping from scene to scene without any kind of moving transition. This comes across as vastly dated, and will be bashed by much of the gaming community, considering the recent backlash against Myst, which used the very same method of movement around the gaming area.   However, this is where the similarities to Myst end. The few things that I believe Myst did with grace, such as storyline and puzzle presentation, are poorly executed in The Legend of Lotus Spring. The puzzles were so simple and bizarre, and the goals of the game so unclear and strange, I often found myself thinking too hard while attempting to complete puzzles that were painfully simple. Now, I know that it may or may not be that middle-aged women that buy games don't want too much of a challenge in their titles, but the gameplay in The Legend of Lotus Spring is so sorry that it makes you wonder if it was meant to be a comment on the intelligence of the casual female gamer. Perhaps they were banking on women seeing the Women Wise logo and impulse buying the game off the retail shelves, and not on the integrity and fun of the game itself.   I'm glad to report that, while not breathtaking, the music and sound effects weren't annoying. The music was classical Asian, which ended up coming out better than it could have, but still fell far, far short of many of the recent big release titles. Although, granted, the Women Wise team was working on a limited budget here, and it sounds as well as it could have. The sound effects were a little lame, at times sounding like they originated from an episode of Blue's Clues.   The game was completely stable. I didn't encounter a single bug in The Legend of Lotus Spring, which is something to be applauded in this day of release-now-and-patch-later games flooding the market. This is particularly nice when dealing with a less computer-literate crowd, as gameplay bugs would just confuse and perhaps discourage a player. Another feature proving that this game was intended for older women inexperienced with computers - there is no install. Yes, you run the complete show off the CD-ROM, which makes a lot of sense when you consider that it cuts down a lot on the system requirements and sidesteps the tidal wave of tech support phone calls associated with game installs. The manual is functional, and gives enough help to get you started. One particularly interesting aspect of The Legend of Lotus Spring is the fact that Women Wise actually commissioned a novella about the story by an author, and is available for download at (*shudder*) Ireadromance.com.   While I'm writing this, I find myself considering my audience. If I were writing for a strictly female oriented publication (and, if I were in fact, middle-aged and female), I probably wouldn't be so harsh. However, I simply can't recommend The Legend of Lotus Spring to the testosterone-heavy hardcore gaming masses - it wouldn't be the best way to spend hard-earned cash, even if you are an adventure game fiend. I made special allowances here in attempting to consider this game from a different standpoint (like the $10 I spent on that wretched aromatherapy candle), but even from the perspective of a casual female gamer, and especially from the perspective of a hardcore one, there are simply too many glaring weak points in gameplay, graphics, and sound in The Legend of Lotus Spring.   This may all come across as beating a dead horse. Maybe casual female gamers, or casual gamers in general, really don't want the same level of quality and difficulty that more dedicated gamers demand. Either way, as much as I would have liked to have seen otherwise, this is not a title for anyone outside of the soccer mom demographic. For you guys out there, don't look to find in The Legend of Lotus Spring the same gushing amounts of concentrated testosterone you find in Soldier of Fortune. Instead, save your chits, and get this for your Mom on Mother's Day. Or, now that I think of it, if you value occasional home-cooked meals, it might be something better unloaded on your mother-in-law.   -- Erik Peterson", "date": "Apr 25, 2000"}
