Stronghold is one of those rare games that comes along without any fanfare and ends up being really special even though nobody really expected much from it. However Crusader had a few of us salivating before its release, as the original game was such a promising appetizer.   Like the original game Crusader sees you ruling the land, running your own castle, developing your economy and of course smiting anyone who dares threaten your dominance. However this time around you have a lot more combat missions to challenge you, a host of new units and a more polished enemy AI to contend with. The game also sees you leading the Holy Crusades during the 1100s and taking the fight to Saladin and his mates in the medieval Middle East.   In case you haven't come across this excellent game in its original incarnation, here is a little background to get you up to speed. In Stronghold (and Crusader) you must manage your economic development as well as oversee your military machine. Indeed the latter is very dependant on all being well with the former and in this sense you will only win games if you have a sound sense of how to best manage a feudal economy. You will then be able to indulge in castle design and tactical combat.   The interface is deep and full of options, but it also delivers very concisely all of the information you need to successfully grow your empire. And there's lot of information to be mastered too. This side of the game was always impressive in the original and no major interface changes have been made for Crusader.    To build a strong army you will have to manage resources like food, leather, stone, ale, wood, bread, and all sorts of weapons that you will have to have hand made by specialist craftsmen. Indeed it is your people who are your most important resource.    These are recruited to help build your economy. Peasants gather in front of your lord's hut, the central structure of your castle. They stand around the campfire rubbing their hands, looking grubby and waiting for you to give them a job worthy of their skills. This is done by building a workplace for them. For example if you want more wood, build woodcutter's huts. If you need more bread you'll need to build bakeries (which cost wood). Your peasants will then wander over to these new buildings and start working for you.   This sounds simple enough, but your people must be kept happy, fed and have somewhere to live. You will also have to make sure they are keen enough on your settlement that you can extract a little coin from them so that you can fund your military expansion. If your people are starving, being taxed too high or have another gripe they will begin buggering off on you, and your economic system will eventually grind to a halt. Your people can be made happy with more food, gardens in your town and even taverns and churches help keep their spirits up. However all of these things cost a lot so you really need to juggle the competing demands the game makes on your resources.   This is the essence of the game's economic model, and this juggling act is also what makes the game so damn enjoyable too. Your reliance on economic judgment as well as solid tactical ability is very much more so important Crusader than it was in the original game as you can command much larger armies this time around, and your settlements become huge too. The maps are also massive, definitely larger, possibly at least four times so.   As was the case in the original game managing a feudal economy requires a lot of understanding. For example if you want to produce the most efficient food type, bread, you have to first get enough wood then setup a farmer to harvest wheat, which he then takes to the storage area where the millers grab it and refine it. Then the flour is picked up by the bakers who get busy with the oven and finally transport the fresh loaves to your granary where your people can finally get the grub. This process is involved and it is the sort of thing that the game tests you to manage well.    However this time around there are a few new buildings and the whole invasion of the Middle East as a part of the Holy Crusades as well. Indeed it is the many new scenarios and campaign options which distinguish Stronghold Crusader from the original game. Stronghold was always a lot of fun to fiddle with, but the game was lacking when it came to the number of battle missions offered and the opportunity to setup quick skirmish battles. This time around there is so much more on your plate and the missions are much more rewarding too.    There are four campaign modes as well as a long and satisfying skirmish mode which pits you against increasingly able and well equipped adversaries. Skirmish mode is a lot of fun and sometimes you will take the field supported by (or supporting) allies and sometimes you will face up to three opponents at once. This can make for some might challenging action and you may have to defend desperately before you can begin to use your more powerful units (like the knights) to take control of the battlefield and slowly, with a few lightning raids to start with, take the initiative away from the enemy.   This sort of thing requires much patience and a keen sense of planning and observation as you have to identify weak spots in the enemy's defenses and then strike hard and fast, all of the while keeping your defensive forces up to strength and on the job. In this sense Crusader delivers much more in the way of involving combat.   That said the game still suffers from the problems that enemy forces don't take the initiative that much and often follow what seem to be preprogrammed channels of movement. This isn't a great thing as you can simply place towers full to the gills with archers on an intercept course and watch the enemy units get sliced to bits by volley after volley of arrow and crossbow fire. However your foes do vary their attack patterns and there are some nasty curve balls they throw your way when they seem to go for your outlying mining operations, which by necessity often end up in remote and hard to defend locations. Without the ability to mine stone to build your defenses or mine ore, which leads to more advanced weapons, you can find yourself under pressure very quickly.   The new different types of troops on offer also help keep the tactical combat varied and exciting as the Arabs have excellent missile troops, fire throwers, mounted archers and slingers which will keep you busy with your often slower European troops getting mown down before they can close and get into melee combat. Luckily you can build a mercenary's tent which you can then use to recruit enemy troops types, but this is very expensive and as such isn't something you can often rely too heavily on.   As the game is set in the desert the visuals are quite different, with more Middle Eastern building types and a lot less lush green arable land. This last issue really makes the game challenging as you have a lot less area you can use for agriculture, so you often find you are building farms very close to enemy lines and getting involved in border skirmishes as a result. This certainly makes the game harder and adds to the more combat oriented feel of the package as a whole.   Combat is still pretty simple point and click stuff and the interface could have done with some refinement in this area. For example the way you are unable to establish troop waypoints after they have been recruited to your barracks or even predetermine your troops' AI stance (aggressive, defensive etc) is really annoying as you have to indulge in the micromanagement to organize your men regarding these issues, when a couple of interface preset options would have been really handy.That said Crusader is a hugely entertaining game, which might not feel different enough for some Stronghold fans. However if you really like Stronghold Crusader is a meaty offering that delivers so much more game play than the original. Classic enemies like the PIG, The Wolf and The Snake also make a return, adding to the cast of Arab lords you must conquer to win the game. It isn't that innovative and neither are the visuals that mind blowing, but strategy gamers will probably love Stronghold Crusader as it delivers more regularly than Dominoes.", "date": "Oct 8, 2002"}
