Why, you get Pokmon Puzzle League of course. There have been a plethora of games that have rehashed, mimicked, and mocked the original Tetris, but Tetris Attack, also known as Panel de Pon in Japan, was one of the first games to actually bring a fresh approach to stacking colored blocks on top of each other. Pokmon Puzzle League has taken an already great model and put a few coats of wax on it. Puzzle fans, don't let the Pokmon license dissuade you; and, Pokmon fans, don't let the puzzle theme turn you off. You may be pleasantly surprised with this game.

So please bear that in mind. This is not a new game concept, merely a new game. The good news is many people haven't played the original Tetris Attack, so this experience is completely new for them. The way the game works is this: you line up three blocks of the same color by flipping them on a vertical axis. Sounds simple, right? Wrong, it's easier said than done. While lining up three blocks of the same color is fairly easy, the blocks keep rising and you'll never get past the first few stages unless you master the chain/combo system. To make a combo you have to consecutively line up four or more blocks. Accomplishing this can be a daunting task at first, but before you know it you'll be lining up five-block combos. After you master the combo system you'll need to understand how to form chain combos. Basically you want to create a ~chain~ of combos by triggering several to fall into place thereafter. See the video below entitled Training Challenge Mode to better understand this process. It is a must to become well accustomed with this to win the game or beat your friends, because after you trigger a combo not only will the blocks temporarily stop rising, but you also drop a line of ~garbage~ in your opponents field in doing so. Further, the only way to get rid of this line of ~garbage~ is to form a combo that touches it. Even then the solid line of ~garbage~ will turn into more blocks after you dissolve it. The only way to win is to play dirty (with garbage, get it?).By now all the Pokmon fans are screaming, ~where does the Pokmon license fit in?~ As far as gameplay goes, it really doesn't. The license is clearly an attempt to sell this game, but it's very well incorporated. The whole game revolves around the idea that you (Ash) and your Pokmon (Pikachu, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur) have been selected to participate in an official Puzzle League tournament. Naturally you go dashing off to Pokmon Puzzle League Village to put your skills to the test against some of the best Pokmon trainers out there. The end goal: facing the ~Puzzle Master.~ On the way you must face a bunch of different trainers to earn badges and awards. The only sign of Pokmon within the gameplay is found in character selection. You can select one of your three Pokmon to use against your opponent. It really doesn't affect the game, though, other than that your Pokmon make unique sounds and drop different colored garbage rows on your competitor. For instance, if you choose to use Pikachu you drop a solid yellow line of garbage with a lighting bolt symbol on it, if you use Squirtle there is raindrop symbol on it, etc. Other than that they don't actually affect the gameplay. Meaning, if you use Pikachu against Horsea you see no benefit. The game features the classic 2-D mode, but also a new 3-D mode. The 3-D mode is mostly the same, but it's a circular column so you have to keep rotating it to keep track of everything. It takes a while to get used to because you have to look behind your playing field to make sure the other parts of the cylinder aren't getting too high. On top of playing the game in both 2-D and 3-D, there are six different modes you can play: One-player Stadium, Two-player Stadium, Marathon, Time Zone, Spa Service, and Puzzle University. In One-Player Stadium you face other Pokmon trainers and win badges; all of which is centered around a Pokmon storyline. The Marathon mode is a never-ending stream of blocks where you see how long you can last as the blocks fill in increasingly faster. Time Zone is your basic beat-the-clock-type mode where you need to rack up as many points as you can in the allotted time. The mysterious sounding Pokmon Spa mode uses a ~clear line~ to indicate the level you must drop all your blocks under to win. In Two-Player Stadium you can face off against your friends (or the CPU if you have none) in versus mode, Time Zone mode, or Pokmon Spa mode.All in all, the gameplay is awesome because it's based on Tetris Attack-style mechanics, not because of the Pokmon license. All the superb art, neat sound effects, and storyline certainly give it a cool unifying theme. MultiplayerTo save yourself from drooling over multiplayer mayhem, please know this game only supports two players at once. We're not sure why they couldn't manage a four-player mode, but it is the one and only disappointment we have with the multiplayer modes. Otherwise, there is some very intense multiplayer action to be found here. Just like Tetris before it, this game will have your eyes in a frenzy, your stomach in a knot, and your heart thumping endlessly. Because there is so much focus needed to play the game, you must continually tell your friends (especially Peer Schneider) to shut up so you can concentrate. Trash talking is not advised, as you may lose your edge. Just as in One-Player Stadium mode you have three Pokmon to use, so once you lose you won't be able to use that Pokmon anymore. Each player has three Pokmon so it's essentially the ~best out of five.~ Further, because there are some really cool sound bytes in the game we advise choosing the most annoying trainers and Pokmon available.GraphicsThe folks at NST have done an awesome job incorporating a ton of Pokmon art into the game. There is a whole slew of different stages based on stadiums, all the characters are apparently hand-drawn (or made to look it), and the game even has animated cut-scenes that look just like the cartoon series. Basically, though, the game revolves around a 2-D engine so don't expect any lush 3-D visuals. It is a puzzle game after all. Still though, the graphics that are there are pretty sleek. Definitely some of the better 2-D stuff done on the N64 as a matter of fact. When you win badges you're treated to full award page, and the badges look as though they've been pre-rendered first. There are a lot of subtle touches to keep the Pokmon feel in the game.SoundYou get your usual stream puzzle-brand music while playing the game. It's a tad bit dynamic so when things get tense the music will change to something more aggressive. The music itself, though, really isn't all that appealing. You're not getting any high-quality techno tracks here, only the usual mix of Nintendo 64 MIDI music, based on  you guessed it  Pokmon. But, the game has a good amount of different songs that it doesn't get horribly redundant. The sound appeal really shines through in the effects area. There is a great multitude of voice bytes and sound effects to keep you happy, and, often times even prompt a laugh. As well, a few of the characters may strike fear into your opponents heart when you rack up a six-line combo and the crowd goes wild as their Pokmon roars. I'm totally addicted and thrilled with Pokmon Puzzle League. To be fair we have to deduct points for some of the technical shortcomings, but I feel it's my mission to let you know how great this game is. Obviously if you don't like Tetris you're certainly not going to like this, but if you like Tetris or were fortunate enough to have played Tetris Attack you'll love this new take on the series. It's got a smooth interface, intuitive controls, and there's plenty of tutorial modes to keep you training for a long time. I highly recommend this game to any child, teenager, or adult who likes the puzzle genre. The Pokmon theme is really just Nintendo's surefire way of selling software. If you're not a fan of those cutesy critters, just overlook them. This mind-bender is terribly addictive when you get into it. In a perfect world, yes, this new offering would feature a Matrix-style soundtrack, moody graphics, and a four-player mode, but we're forced to forget about that dream for now. The principle remains the same, whether you're playing checkers with cookies or actual checker pieces it's still the same game. Consider that, and then promptly buy Pokmon Puzzle League if it suits you.", "date": "Sep 27, 2000"}
