Things started off strong when it unleashed its GameDay franchise on PSX. The FaceOff series was no slouch, either. But things took a rapid nosedive as soon as everything moved over to Playstation 2. None of 989's franchises made a proper transition from the last generation to the next, and the gap is only widening as each year passes.   And so it seems that 989's best, though probably least expected, hope was to start anew. And so came World Tour Soccer 2002. The game was a strong start to a new franchise, and one that had a fair bit of a better showing last year than any of 989's classic franchises. So this year brings the release of World Tour Soccer 2003.   World Tour Soccer 2002 featured some nice play mechanics, a reasonable graphics engine and quite a few play modes. This year's edition ups the ante in almost every department, and though it's getting so close to becoming a great game, it's still oh so far away. The goal is in sight, though...   Gameplay  Last year's incarnation of World Tour Soccer came replete with plenty of play modes. This year's game adds a few new modes that stretch out the replay factor even more. Like last year's game, there are a handful of different competition, season and tournament modes to pick from. There's enough customization and variety to these modes (not to mention the insane number of leagues and teams) that these alone would provide for months of soccer action.    Where you're likely to spend the most time, though, is in the new Career mode. You start the Career mode in control of a small, and pretty terrible, school. You can customize the team's jersey, flag, name, etc. to your heart's content, so creating a team that matches your own personal style is quite easy. Your first season is against a group of other schools, all with players just as terrible as your own. If you're able to win the School League, your team will be promoted to the Semi-Professional league. Your players will have gained a bit in their age, strength and overall playing ability. Win the Semi-Pro league and you're off to a professional league. You'll start in the lowest division of that league, though, and you'll have to continue to work your way up through the ranks. Once you make it to a professional league your team will start raking in some dough. You can then enter the transfer market to buy and sell players and attempt to help your team move up to better divisions and hopefully to World Champion status.    If the Career mode wasn't already enough to suck every second of free time out of your life, behold the Challenge mode. You'll play one game against the computer where you'll earn points at the end of the game depending on how well you play. You're able to choose your team, but the computer sets up the rest of the match's settings for you. Points are awarded for playing well in every aspect of the game. If you're able to score a lot of goals but aren't able to master a decent passing game, your points will suffer for it. Pardon the pun, but the goal here is to play as clean and efficiently as possible. You'll be given a password after the game that you can then enter into 989's website. The password will allow you to be ranked with other players from parts unknown to see how you stack up. You may be the best player in your neighborhood, but what about that kid in Kentucky with a mullet?    Plenty of play modes would be futile if the game itself wasn't any fun. Luckily, as it should be, the way the game actually plays is its strongest aspect. The controls are tight and respond very well. There's actually a slight learning curve involved since so many passing and movement options are available to you, so you may find yourself performing moves that you didn't intend to for the first couple games. The controls are easy to come to grips with, though, and once you have them down they work very well.   There are numerous upon numerous ways to pass the ball, enough so that they may actually seem a tad overwhelming at first. Almost every button has more than one function, depending on how you press it, or in which combination. For example, tapping X will result in a short pass. Holding X will perform a ground pass one-two. Tapping X and then Square will be a one-two with a return chip pass, while tapping X followed by Triangle will be a one-two with a return through ball. This may sound a bit confusing to some, but soccer (or football, as 99% of the world calls it) enthusiasts will no doubt be impressed, especially since that's only a portion of the passing options available.   Simply moving players around also has its fair share of various moves. You're able to spin, shimmy and step over players at the press of a button. You're also able to fake a dive, which can be quite funny at times. If a player is close enough and getting a bit rough with you, intentionally diving may fake out the referee and the other player may be carded for it. If you're caught faking it, though, that card may be for you.   Tracking off-screen teammates can be done in couple different ways. The first is to turn on the radar, where everyone on the field is represented by colored dots. This will allow you to see where everyone on the field is, though you have to look down to the bottom of the screen to see it. It's standard stuff as far as sports games go, and if you never had a problem with it in any other game, then it'll be fine for you here as well.     An alternative to the on-screen radar, and one that's superior to it, are the arrows that appear and point to off-screen players. They point to anyone that isn't visible on-screen and make it much easier to know where surrounding players are. The arrows don't get in the way of your normal view of the field, but your peripheral vision can pick them up quite easily. This feature should be in practically every type of sports game. It makes utilizing more of your players on the field much easier, so much in fact that it takes some getting used to when going back to any other game that doesn't have the off-screen player arrows.   One nice aspect of the game is that the goalies act in a realistic manner. You won't find the ball being magically sucked into their possession whenever the computer decides that you shouldn't make a shot. Instead, the goalie reacts to shots as he should, and he's only able to block shots that are actually able to be blocked. The game's physics are fairly good throughout the game, but are most noticeably accurate in regards to how the goalie and ball interact. Punched and blocked shots fall away as they should, and you'll see the goalie reach accurately to get the ball, as opposed to the ball moving to reach the goalie.    Unfortunately, as well as the game plays, the stat tracking leaves a quite bit to be desired and is the game's only real downside, but it can be a major one. While the game keeps most of the stats that you'd be interested in one way or another, the way that they're presented on the stat screen isn't as robust or natural as one would hope. For instance, you might want to see how well a player is tackling. One screen has your players' number of attempted tackles, and another has the number of tackles won. It would have made much more sense for them to be side by side so that reading them would be more natural. Since the stats are sorted separately on each screen, you'll have to scan each list to find one player and compare numbers. Some of the other stats are only listed by percentages, such as pass completion. There's no way to tell if a player who has completed 75% of his passes has tried passing only four times or four hundred.   One cool thing about the stats is that it keeps numbers for how well each player performed in their last match. This makes it easy to compare how a player performed in the last game compared to the rest of the tournament or season. It also happens that it's necessary to use this to view the stats from the previous game, since the end-game stats are minimal and only list which players scored goals along with a small bit of overall team stats. There's no way to view player performance for the game, except for going to each player's individual stats page after the game and checking. Unfortunately, the game only saves last game stats for players on human controlled teams, so you won't be able to go check how well the players of another team performed against you.   Team customization is pretty sweet. Customizing your jersey offers a ton of options for practically limitless design potential. You can edit numerous parts of your jersey, and many of those parts have multiple layers. This means that you can pile on up to seven different design templates over top of the base color. If want a red stripe going one way over top of a blue stripe going another, you can do that. There are quite a few different designs to pick from for each piece of the jersey, and you can change the color on each layer separately, so piling up a few smaller designs can lead to a fairly original looking jersey, or an incredibly ugly one if you're not fashion inclined or just plain odd.    Your team's flag works in the same way as the jerseys do. Flip through a ton of different layer templates and choose the color for each until you've created the perfect flag. The only thing that would really be better is if you could just draw your own flag or jersey design, though you have enough options here that being able to draw your own designs would really only benefit those who are truly twisted and want something a little less, shall we say, conventional as their logo.   Graphics  Stadiums in the game are gorgeous. The actual accuracy as to how well they match their real life counterparts is debatable. We attempted to get IGN to fly us around Europe and other places abroad in order to check out the real things, but upper management knew that it was really only an excuse to obtain the freshest Guinness possible and saw right through our little ruse. Nonetheless, the stadiums look fantastic. Close-ups of each team are shown as matches start, though you'll probably look past the players and focus on the surrounding scenery. That's not to say that the players look bad; rather, it's just that the stadiums look that good.    The players aren't too sore on the eyes, either. Their faces, bodies and extraneous limbs are all detailed in a nice fashion. Muscle tone is represented on the players quite well, as are ears, noses and other facial features. The only real flaw in how any of the players look is that you may notice blotches of off-color pigmentation on a few of their faces. It looks like some of them applied an uneven amount of makeup before the game, but that's really only a minor problem and not one that really hinders the game's overall appearance much.   Animation is pretty spot-on as well. There are a handful of elaborate kick and tackle animations, but most of the action takes on a realistic look and is therefore pretty much how you'd expect it to look. Everything does looks very clean and polished, though. Different animations blend together quite well, and you'll hardly ever notice the transition from one animation set to the next. Simple running blends into a brutal tackle almost seamlessly.   The goalies move especially nice. You'll see them make some fairly spectacular saves from time to time, though it all looks very natural and realistic. Your goalie may make a diving block to one side, landing flat on his stomach, only to pop up and dive in the other direction to make another quick save. The goalies move in a very fluid manner, and it's a thrill to watch them pop up and make save after save, cursing them for their talent but not for cheating.   There's a bit of slowdown from time to time, but it doesn't normally affect gameplay. The slowdown usually only occurs when a handful of players are shown up close, like at the end of a half when everyone is walking off the field. The slowdown isn't choppy in any way during these instances; it looks more like intentional slow motion and actually works to sort of a neat effect. It doesn't usually look bad except when the game jarringly kicks back up to speed in the middle of a cool slow-mo team shot and you realize that it wasn't intentional.    Sound  The game's commentary is fairly good. The commentators' general match calling is about par as far as what sort of things they comment on. You'll hear them mention steals, tackles, nice bouts of passing and other things of that nature. Where they stand out, though, is that they sometimes convey a nice sense of excitement and enthusiasm that matches what's happening in the game pretty well. For example, they'll seem pretty calm and relaxed as you just pass the ball around midfield a bit, but once you finally make it into shooting range and take a shot on goal you'll hear them shout the name of the shooting player as he attempts to score. It's pretty rewarding to drive downfield and hear the commentators yell ~Richards!~ or some such just as a shot is taken, only to hear them sound a little disappointed as the shot ricochets off of the post.   The commentators also do a pretty nice job of wrapping up the game after the match is over. If you had just made a last minute comeback to win the game, the commentators will mention your last second heroics. If the game was entirely boring after a few early goals, they'll mention that as well. The game does a nice job of making you believe that the commentators may have actually been watching and paying attention to the match that you just played, rather than being random sound samples thrown out as the game commenced and ended.    The rest of the sound is of fairly standard quality. Crowd noises and general aural filler work fine, but it's nothing to write home about. There isn't a whole lot of noise that actually comes from the action on the field, so there's not much to mention there one way or the other. The commentary is what'll mostly be coming out of your speakers, and in this case it's best bit of the audio mix anyway.World Tour Soccer 2003 does everything right on the gameplay side. The controls are tight and you have so many options for moving the ball downfield that it can take some serious time to master the game's subtleties. The graphics convey the sport's look and feel fairly accurately, and the numerous play modes will keep you occupied for quite some time...That is, if you aren't a stats fanatic. There simply aren't enough stats, or at least enough that are properly tracked and displayed, to quench the numbers thirst that many simulation fanatics will be looking to crave. With the Career mode opening up the possibility for some insanely deep and lengthy gameplay, it's a wonder why the stats weren't fleshed out better.Having said that, those who are looking for a soccer game that simply plays great and need only a basic set of stats will find exactly what they're looking for. In reality, it's only the stat tracking that should be the deciding point of whether this game is for you or not. Hopefully next year's edition will feature a much fuller set of tracked stats. Besides that, the game only needs a small bit of polishing to really be something great.", "date": "Feb 11, 2003"}
