Ironically, there's nothing new here at all. Creating a relatively fast game with better than average frame rates, ~high resolution,~ and more than 70 international teams, Z-Axis' effort is worth taking a look at, even if it may not be worth buying. Gameplay  Considering how lousy a game Fox Sports College Hoops '99 was for basketball, Alexi Lalas International Soccer is a far more distinguished game in the realm of soccer. As players begin their experience, the mere two game modes may set them back a bit. It's clear this isn't a luxurious effort. It's not packed to the brim with options and little touches that spoil the gamer. By simply comparing this title to International Superstar Soccer and FIFA 99, for instance, players will find far less options, modes of play, moves, and features in Lalas. But at its heart, Lalas means just to focus on the Friendly matches and Tournaments, two modes that do cover the basics well enough.  The title obviously stars Alexi Lalas, of the Kansas City Wizards and US national team fame. But it also features 250 different motion-captured player animations from USA team member Eric Wynalda. During the game, five different cameras (Goalcam, TVcam, Closecam, Targetcam, and Sidecam) will follow the action - the main viewpoint remains at a side-scrolling perspective, then swings in when the ball gets close to the goal.  Alexi Lalas International Soccer also focuses on Team Management. Players can manage their team's strategies and tactics, customize playing formations, and switch tactics on the fly. There will be 70 international teams and secret teams included in the game. All of this is standard fare for soccer games, and Z-Axis's attempt doesn't throw anything particularly new into the stew. On the other hand, management is relatively easy to control, and doesn't throw any obstacles in your way, either.  Inside the game, control is relatively entertaining. Players have decent ball control and a sufficient array of kicks, including pass through in both ground and chips kicks. But according to the manual there is apparently no way to dribble - i.e. juke or fake the opposition. Apparently, it's all about running, circling, passing, and the give-and-go's. That can't be good.  The game is slightly faster than most, a benefit to more quick-paced people (i.e., hyperactive gamers, i.e. most of you), but a minus in realism, if you're picky (i.e. most of you). Frankly, I enjoyed the sped up play. Players have access to the turbo button too, to speed up your players, something that's definitely helpful in a one-on-one situation.   AI is also decent, if a little patchy. Players can't make low cross-field passes without a defender intercepting and changing the momentum. Also, it's not a piece of cake to simply dribble in and score immediately after the whistle. For those who want extra challenge, several different levels of difficulty are available, Youth, Professional, and World Class.   Often times, however, the AI is simply cruddy. Defenders from your own team are rather stupid and watch the game evolve around them. Several times I watched as an opponent dribble down the left hand side of the field and my defender simply stood there, not attacking, backing up or even picking his damned nose! At least he could have done that! It was like he didn't have the programming chip in his neck or something. Man, that was annoying. The only apparent solution is to switch your player manually. But shouldn't the defense play defense without me switching to every single player? (Yes, it should.).  The ball physics are decent. A kicked ball will slam into and spin against the net, which reacts realistically, and the ball will fall down and bounce a few times. Likewise, when it arches after a kick, or when it's headed, it moves like a real ball.  Graphics  The graphics are a truly mixed bag. Blocky, obvious surfboards for hands, and hilarious, web-footed players who truly have formed a new kind of shoe -- a hybrid of a flipper and a cement block - are more than entertaining. I can't say this game is good looking, nor can it be said that it looks like a next-generation PlayStation game.  The so-called high-resolution graphics don't seem to prevent a solid frame rate from running well most of the time. But the game looks frickin' weird. With high res running, the dehumanized character models themselves, which aren't terribly good looking in the first place, are only magnified to a troublesome new height. These guys all look slightly closer to a team of thick-legged Frankenstein monsters than a bunch of soccer players.  And finally, the motion capture looks good. Goalies are especially fantastic in their smooth leaps, dives, and swatting motions. What's really funny is that they dive or leap even when a slow, rolling ball comes toward them. They have lots of animation sequences, too, but apparently the one for slowly picking up a friendly ball wasn't in the deck. Oh well.  Sound  Lots of talk during the game. It may frighten some smaller kids, hearing all of that ~weird~ European talk, but then that's what happens when you play a game not dominated by Americans. Actually, the talk is all good, and rarely did it annoy me. The game is filled with decent music, too, a weird hip-hop groove that somehow doesn't sound like hip-hop at all. Go figure.  I like this game because it covers all of the bases well. It's not a particularly good looking game, but it plays decently, despite missing some of the deeper aspects of soccer, like dribbling, for instance, and more controllable players in general. I didn't hate it, but like so many PlayStation games, it's OK, not great, not brilliant, just decent.  International Superstar Soccer and FIFA 99 still rule the roost in my book.", "date": "May 27, 1999"}
