And Sony is to blame from early on - releasing now-infamous pre-rendered videos of what they hoped would be a fair comparison to the final release of the game and inflating our expectations. Jaws dropped back then; would the final game match the original vision? A couple of years, a chopped-down Japanese version and a wholly improved PAL release later, we have our final opinion of the title that Sony is banking on at their launch.   We won't leave you in suspense - we love MotorStorm; love it like we love great games in general. It's clever, challenging, frequently exciting and even more frequently beautiful. But we'll also admit that it isn't perfect and there are some significant omissions that - likely due to pressure to get the game to market - flick some mud on an otherwise shimmering chassis.   For the handful of readers who have otherwise ignored MotorStorm up to this point, firstly, we're impressed and confused; secondly, allow us to give you the brief on the gameplay. If you've ever watched off-road rallycross on television, ever played a mud-smeared racer on console or simply wished you could see the inner-workings of your car in fine detail as it disintegrates, this game has you covered. It also features some nicely exaggerated physics that must be mastered completely in order to progress.    The crucial ingredients in MotorStorm's heady brew are the crashes and the courses. Why are we coupling these together? Really, you can't have one without the other. Crashing in MotorStorm provides a twisted kind of pleasure, in that the team at Evolution studios have clearly studied vehicle deformation and have convincingly emulated the crumple and tweak of metal to a tee. Watching a Mud Plugger come apart at the seams after a vicious sideswipe that introduces you to a rocky outcrop is much more fun than it should be under the competitive circumstances.    It also provides an unexpected element of strategy. See, by taking advantage of each vehicle's boost gauge, you can give yourself as much as 15 seconds of nitrous action, propelling you through canyons and over ridges like a jet-engine strapped to a Volkswagen Beetle - fun, until you lose control and take a short trip through your windshield. If you boost too long, your engine blows out and you're forced to respawn. However, if you're critically low on boost and can afford a blow-out, you can pull the off-road equivalent of a pit-in. Likewise, the blow-out can provide just enough inertia to push you over the finish-line - ahead of your nearest rival. About as sneaky as it is satisfying.   All hail Rain God Mesa - our new favourite track. Awesome stuff.  All this exploding has to take place somewhere, of course; why not in the middle of the American painted-desert. Evolution has carefully and accurately modelled the game's courses from a handful of desert environments. Circuits take place on open mesas, winding through eroded valleys, across towering mountains and over cascading, jutting rock formations. All of these natural features are well-textured and lit, and the undulations bump-mapped to perfection. It's easy to overlook the natural flow of the courses, too - paths that branch throughout, allowing access for certain classes of vehicle rather than others. After three laps, cars and riders have accumulated inch-thick coatings of mud, and the track is crisscrossed with tread-marks, running through puddles of mud and bowls of dust. The environmental details don't end there - virtually every object in the game is naturally self-shadowed, and trackside hazards are imbued with tasty physics effects too.   There are 21 'tickets' - MotorStorm's equivalent to racing exhibitions, featuring between two and four races in each. These are divided between four skill levels, and the higher you place in each race, the more points you earn, freeing up new tickets.    The AI is remarkably unforgiving. This is something that we weren't really prepared for in a genre generally populated by lifeless automatons who care little for strategy beyond getting from point A to B in as short a time as possible. Frequently we were pushed off our bikes, muscled into walls, other vehicles, over edges and through fences; the AI is aggressive, merciless and surprising; a refreshing change that adds an extra dimension to the off-road experience. The downside is, they can be too good, and they also tend to clump - a combination that can lead to moments of hair-pulling, Sixaxis-hurling frustration, particularly when you're moments from the finish line in a tough-as-nails event.   MotorStorm's other key point of difference between it and a more standard rally racer is the mix-and-match approach to vehicles. Though restricted in many ticket events - but not so in multiplayer - you can choose from lightning-bolt motorcycles, flimsy ATVs, muscle-cars, redneck trucks, Humvee-like war machines, crazy dune buggies and modified road-train front ends, pulled straight from Steven Spielberg's Duel. Each has a preferred terrain, rated out of 5, and the courses are designed in such a way that each is completely playable - if very challenging - by every vehicle. Certain narrow passes are more suited to lighter vehicles, whereas long stretches of mud will kill all but the heaviest vehicles, for instance.    The races in the game can be comprised of a mix of these different types of vehicles - such as all bikes and one Mack-truck, or a street-racers versus trucks challenge. This system of shuffling the transport options and creating 'theme' races is downright brilliant. Pitting players, who are limited to bikes, against a number of oversized, gung-ho opponents in an environment of tight turns and steep drops means that you really need to be in complete control of your wheels at all times. Liberal use of the left-trigger's brakes is recommended, as is keeping your urge to punch the nitro, Burnout-style, in check.   Combining between 11 and 14 other racers creates a certain 'randomness' to the racing dynamic.  Moments into your first on-track experience in the game, you'll start to see exactly what we mean. People on bikes are taking potshots at each other; cars are rolling and flipping; wheels go flying, debris is everywhere - a sole truck flies overhead and onto a buggy, which explodes. It's chaos. This is a double-edged sword that unfortunately will trip you up just as often as it will make you cackle with unholy delight.   Like the old wave-physics in perennial classic Wave Race 64, the undulations and variations of the terrain, coupled with intense and constant jostling for position means that race outcomes can vary wildly. Countless races were lost on small mistakes, and table placement can sometimes rely on luck and a solid start as much as skill. You'll either love or hate this - it's the racing equivalent of a sandbox game in a lot of ways, so get used to wildly different outcomes.    The much-demanded multiplayer modes are fully implemented in the PAL release. After choosing to play 'online' from the main menu, you are asked to select your regional preference for server play. This is a bummer - you can only choose from Australia/New Zealand and EU territories. If you were looking forward to playing your mates in The States, you'll be disappointed.    There are plenty of options at your disposal, as well as full stat-tracking of your online performance. As host, you can customise your track, vehicle selection limits, time of day (for that delightful touch of ambience), and number of laps. The stat-tracker, linked to your signed-in username, keeps track of your percentage of wins, losses, distance, times and many other comparative stats.   Chaos. Incredible, eye-popping chaos.  With games hosted in Australia, we experienced virtually no lag whatsoever. A lot of the performance is obviously dependent on the host's connection, however, but we're confident that online play is generally very stable within Australia. With games hosted in the UK, we experienced a fair bit of lag, but this is to be expected, considering the distance involved.   As much as we wish we could turn a blind eye to telltale 'launch game pratfalls', we can't. Load times are an issue. It can take 10 to 15 seconds to load the vehicle selection screen - which is a little shoddy, since there isn't all that much going on there that couldn't be replicated with an image or pretender video. Getting into a race harkens back to the PSone era of 30-second load times. This is an issue that is inherent to the Blu-ray access speeds - though we'd expect this to improve as developers get clever with using cached information on HDDs and data placement and order on the disc itself.   Loved that last lap? Did you manage a particularly cool seven car pile-up? Wanna watch the replay? Tough luck, bucko. No replays. The closest thing in MotorStorm is the AI-controlled lap that follows on from each completed race. Oh how we'd love to be able to save cool laps, great explosions, near-misses and grand stunts, upload them to the PlayStation Network or Home and share them! Alas, 'tis not to be.   We also miss a true career mode - though the events-based ticket system works just fine. But it's a staple of the genre for a reason, and we wouldn't mind a few unlockable parts for a touch of customisation. And, outside of some brief making-of and concept art videos, there isn't a heap to unlock. Features-wise, this is a pretty scant offering, beyond the undeniably lush racing. Again, this is a time-related issue - it's a launch game after all, but this far after the initial release, the content is starting to show a little bit of age.   There is so much to love about MotorStorm that it makes smaller flaws stand out more prominently. It's the kind of game that would benefit from extra modes - stunt modes, Burnout-style explosion modes and a few more tracks. Given that it's a launch title, we wholly expect shortcomings and simplified content. That MotorStorm succeeds as often as it does is a testament to the abilities of developer, Evolution - it leaves us wanting even more.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
