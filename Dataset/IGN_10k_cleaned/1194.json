You have to do these things when you work at an all ages site, carefully checking over any games with the combination of ~chix~ and ~stix~ in the title, by law. It was real, the kids loved the demo, and now Globalstar has distributed the game to retail stores everywhere, with a box cover that is sure to wrench eyes away from the Flight Simulator section, and a pricetag lower than most of the game's star's bustlines. At around $15 bucks, buying a racing game featuring 70's music and even more 70's girls seems like a no-brainer... but should you be saving up your money for something a big meatier?  The plotline goes like this -- in the dawn of our civilization, a mighty wizard found a magical crystal that allowed him to... no, you pretty much just race cars, and listen to guitar chords go wacka-wacka. You'll be up and running with this one in under a minute, and you can pick up the controls faster than your average console title. The game supports joysticks and steering wheels, but the game is simple and straightforward enough that a good gamepad will assist you much better than anything more elaborate. You pick one of the Chix, take a look at their car (with the car's stats curiously hidden, while the girl's stats are emblazoned everywhere), and race away. Unlike most racing titles, you've got to win first in order to move on the next race, period. While this may aid in making the game feel weightier than it really is, it also means a lot of frustration, especially when you deal with the nasty AI involved in Hot Chix -- but we'll get to that later.  Environments range from alpine hillsides to snowy small towns to arid deserts, each one with a surprisingly (or not so surprising considering Fiendish' great art department) crispy look. This definitely isn't Need for Speed, but the graphics have some nice touches, especially when compared to most budget titles on the market. The pop-in can get fairly close however, so if you take your eyes off the road directly in front of your wheels, you might find yourself seeing some nasty pops when you least expect it. The cars bounce and turn nicely, though there's a lack of any sort of damage in the game, which takes away from normally satisfying crashes and fender benders with opposing vehicles.  The music in the game is a mixed blessing. You'll definitely enjoy the thick 70's tunes that fill the races... at least for the first lap; after a few minutes you'll be heading to the options screen to turn off the music altogether. Despite the nice, live quality to the music, they tend to get repetitive very quickly, and there's just not enough variety to keep you from getting anything but annoyed after playing through a full race competition. And of course, there's a referencing problem with the game where the entire race seems to slow through molasses, then shoot out at a million miles an hour ever time the soundtrack restarts. Not a very pretty site, overall.  The gameplay is really where Hot Chix falters, however. While the power sliding can be fun, and while the maps sports a lot of visual variety, none of this matters if the AI is weak, and in Hot Chix it can't even pick up a five pound weight let alone support an entire game, even at $15. You know you've got trouble when you actually see cars stopped ahead of you, waiting for you to get close enough to begin moving once again. Racing usually goes one of two ways in Hot Chix, depending on whether you've decided to use a gamepad vs. a keyboard, and depending on what car you use. You'll either blow by the competition, leaving them in the dust for the entire race, or you'll lose your place by making a slight mistake, and never, ever, ever get it back, no matter how hard you try. You'll pop from last place to first in the matter of moments through a random stroke of luck -- or the opposite will happen, even if you're racing a perfect lap. To add to this, some cars can make junk out of the competition with little or no effort, while others can never seem to catch up with the slowest of cars, even with the pedal placed firmly to the metal. And because you'll have to take first to win every race, you'll see these tricks play out with frustrating consequences, such as the race I replayed four times because I'd lose first place within the last 20 seconds of the whole race. The lack of reliable AI (cars take all the shortcuts and corners perfectly one moment, then run straight into walls and rocks the next) just makes the entire experience feel a bit like seeing behind the curtain to watch the puppeteers -- the suspension of disbelief is lost, and so's the charm, once you've played through a few levels.  It's hard to be incredibly critical of any game that costs as much as your average CD, but when it comes to reviewing, you've got to wonder if a game is worth playing in any shape or form. The good thing here is that Hot Chix is definitely better than your average budget title -- the bad thing is that that's still not saying much.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
