Officially, it's really Sega GBA Pinball Game Number 2 since THQ handled the Sonic Spinball port, but it's obvious that the Sega chaps love their silver ball. Last year's Pinball of the Dead was a solid collection of original pinball tables, but not much other than that. Sonic Pinball Party has its own set of original video pinball titles, with a whole lot more added so the action doesn't get old and monotonous quickly. The tables are solidly constructed and there's a lot of extras to unlock that encourage playing them over and over. The only issue is in the actual physics model created for the game; the ball is just too light and bouncy for strategic, pinball wizard-style target shooting. Features Three full, changing pinball tables Three casino games Tiny Chao Garden Link cable support for four players (single cartridge) GameCube connectivity Cartridge save for high scores and unlockables Only for Game Boy Advance Sonic Pinball Party features three pinball tables based on games that were created by Sega's Sonic Team development group. Sonic the Hedgehog has players whacking the silver ball around targets to save little Flicky creatures, hatching Chao creatures, and, ultimately, defeating Dr. Eggman. The Nights table is a wonderful pinball rendition of the Saturn game, where players hit the ball at targets and through loops, delivering the ball to the Ideya Capture to score tons of bonus points. Samba de Amigo has also been given its own table complete with rhythm bonus boards, but players will have to play through Sonic Pinball Party's story mode in order to unlock it for standard play. These tables can be played in standard Arcade Mode, but the real challenge is to work through the tournament ladder in Story Mode. It's here where all the unlockables in Sonic Pinball Party are acquired.  The developers really take advantage of the ~virtual~ aspect of pinball. The collection of tables are obviously based upon real pinball ideas, but the team throw in elements that just couldn't happen on a true pinball table. Each of the three tables has moving items that can be taken out with a well placed shot with the ball for additional points; the Sonic table specifically can have a dozen or so rings scattered around it to collect as well. Other ~video pinball~ elements include graphic elements that change (the table's artwork will transform during play as gamers get higher in the levels), ~scenery~ that animates, and balls that change color during specific modes in the game.  Three tables with several mini-challenges are certainly enough for a video pinball collection, but Sega's gone the extra mile with a bunch of additional challenges. The ~party~ in Sonic Pinball Party comes from the game's three additional mini-games for up to four players, only requiring one copy of the game to feed the additional systems hooked up in the link cable chain. Hot Potato is a strange challenge where players try to send all the balls to the other players' tables. In Hockey, players try to flip balls through the other players' flippers to score points. And Ladder is a cooperative challenge where players work together, timing their flippers to get the ball up the ~ladder~ of flippers. None of these multiplayer games are really spectacular, but they are certainly nice additions to the overall package. You'll also find an interesting collection of pinball-designed casino games, two of which are locked: Roulette, Bingo, and Slots. These games are a great way to score rings for the Tiny Chao Garden, also included in the package (with a really clever puzzle game that's a cross between Bust-a-Move and Othello.), but the casino games are a little on the easy side since players can simply repeat the same move over and over to hit the ball in the target hole.  As much fun as the tables are in Sonic Pinball Party, Sega's pinball physics engine isn't quite there yet. I honestly couldn't say if the development team ~borrowed~ the engine utilized in Pinball of the Dead, but Sonic Pinball Party certainly feels like its own game. The ball in this game is a little too bouncy and light, which makes it hard to ~trap~ the ball against a raised flipper, or pass it from one flipper to the other by hitting the flipper quickly. There are also places where the ball will rest against a flat surface and get stuck, and it's obvious the programmers knew about these areas since the game triggers an automatic ~nudge~ to free up the ball when it happens. It's a shame that players can't tweak the weight of the ball in the options menu for their own pinball tastes. The graphics are really wild, colorful, and energeti, but when three balls get going in the game's multiball mode, it's tough to ignore the patches of slowdown that occur. But, then, there hasn't been a pinball game on the GBA that's been able to offer a slowdown-free experience. Sega's first pinball game, Pinball of the Dead is a very solid title for the Game Boy Advance. But Sonic Pinball Party offers a lot more bang for the buck; lots more extras to unlock and play beyond the standard set of tables. It's a great looking, and fun pinball game on the GBA system. I just can't give it an Editor's Choice, though, since the lightweight physics make it difficult to pull of skilled, bulls-eye shots, and the Casino mini-games weren't balanced very well; it's too easy to get ~in the zone~ and continuously hitting the ball into the target over and over and over. But the extra little game in the Tiny Chao Garden, a puzzle game that combines Bust-a-Move with Othello is almost worth overlooking the little negative nuances that slipped into the development of Sonic Pinball Party. It's a great game, but not quite a must-have.", "date": "May 29, 2003"}
