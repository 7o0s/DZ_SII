I just can't consciously write a review for this game without using that tired old  clich, ~If you're a fan of the original, you'll like this one.~ I'm sorry, I just had to get that out. If that didn't make you cringe, read on to find out about the game. Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko is the third outing for that obnoxious, wisecracking lizard. At its core, it's a continuation of last year's 3D game released by Midway, Gex 3D: Enter the Gecko. Gex 3 is using an enhanced version of the graphics engine that was employed in last year's version, and it also borrows heavily from Gex 3D in terms of game design while adding a few new elements (including a plot featuring Baywatch babe Marliece Andrado) to freshen up the action.And just a little factoid: third Gex title, third publisher. The original, side-scrolling Gex was published directly by Crystal Dynamics. The second game, Gex 3D: Enter the Gecko was picked up for publishing by Midway. This time, Eidos is handling the gecko's publishing duties. Can't this guy find a permanent home?GameplayThe plot goes a little something like this: Gex's arch-nemesis Rez kidnapped Agent Xtra (played by B-actress (but very good-looking) Marliece Andrado). Throughout the game, Xtra will egg you on with sexual innuendoes and horrendous dialogue as you run through the levels collecting remote controls. See, collecting remote controls enables you to progress through other television dimensions (most of which won't activate without a quota of remotes). You'll wander through scenes such as a twisted North Pole, an Egyptian pyramid, the Wild West -- even a crazy version of Jack and the Beanstalk  scooping up fly tokens (50 will net you an extra life), bonus coins (to access bonus stages), and, of course, remote controls.Like the original 3D Gex, Deep Cover Gecko ~borrows~ its level structures from Super Mario 64, in which you're faced with a clue to obtaining one of the levels' remotes. By completeing a set task  which can be as easy as finding a television monitor, or as obscure as tail-thwaping ice blocks into Gex sculptures  you'll activate a switch that will award you with a remote and zap you out of the level. Then, it's back into the world for another remote. After collecting enough remotes from a specific world, you can take them and enter worlds that require a set amount of controllers.Gex retains much of his abilities from Enter the Gecko. He can jump, double jump up high, tail-whip enemies, climb specific walls, and karate kick. But unique to the game are the costumes. Some levels give him specific abilities  for example, in the Sherlock Holmes level, using the spyglass to look around will uncover bonus games  you'll shrink down to a tiny size and try and solve the puzzle in the giant world. In the ~Little Red Riding Hood~ level, tapping the crouch button while in the air will enable a flapping motion of the cape to glide from one platform to the next.If you find coins, you'll be able to enter bonus worlds to earn extra lives  and some of these tasks are pretty out there. In one, you'll take control of a kangaroo (with Gex snuggled into the pouch) and find ten bells to kick. In another, you'll don a helmet and hop into a WWII tank  you're required to take out all the Rez-controlled tanks.GraphicsIt's obvious that Gex: Deep Cover Gecko is built upon the same engine that drove Gex 3D: Enter the Gecko. However, some tweaking was made to give the player more control over the cameras  while it's still not perfect, the camera has been fixed to a point where you'll no longer get seasick as it tries to nestle into the best viewpoint.The textures have also been spruced up with more detail and color, and there are even some nifty transparency and reflection effects going on. There will be the occasional texture tear or drop-out if the camera gets too close to the action, but for what it's doing, it's forgivable.The graphics aren't as solid and impressive as, say, Crash 3: Warped, but they're still pretty impressive for the fifth-year PlayStation.SoundI just want to say four words to describe the sound in Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko: Shut the hell up. The Dana Gould one-liners were a nice gimmick in the first game, and they were brought over for a revisit in Enter the Gecko. But c'mon  he's just not funny. Thank god you can turn off the running commentary  it's pretty obnoxious to have him constantly spout monologue like ~This place is colder than a supermodel stare at an all-you-can-eat buffet~ or ~There's gold in them there teeth.~ Let's hope someone rips out the lizard's voice-box if he ever gets a third sequel.As for the music that accompanies the audio, that's another story. Some of the background tunes are quite appropriate and well produced for the game's situations. You can thank the CD storage for the quality music.Not much has changed overall when you compare Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko to last year's offering. I actually really liked Gex: Enter the Gecko when it was released on the PlayStation, because there really wasn't any 3D platform games that came up to the quality of Super Mario 64. With Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, it's an extension of the second game, and not much more than that. Sure, there are newer elements, like level designs and graphics (as well as a stupid plot that seemed to be thrown in at the last minute), but you're going to be traversing familiar territory when you pop in this disc. That is, of course, if you played Gex: Enter the Gecko. It's a very solid 3D platformer.", "date": "Mar 30, 1999"}
