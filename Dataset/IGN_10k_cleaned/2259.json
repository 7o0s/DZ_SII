You've spent years with it, enjoying every moment in its warm embrace. You've whispered things to it that you wouldn't even tell your mother. You've accepted Tony Hawk as your new savior, and if you haven't played Tony Hawk you've been in a cave -- though if you've been in a cave, then you're the perfect person to be reading this review. For the rest of us that have played our way through both games, Tony Hawk 2X has us scratching our heads. It's one of the best compilations to date... but it's still a compilation.  It's a seamless, lightning fast ride through Tony Hawk 2 with every detailed tuned to perfection, just for the Xbox. There are blades of grass where flat textures used to be, there are detailed face models where there were painted ovals, and there's speed, lots of smooth speed. There's also all of Tony Hawk 1 (with your new moves from 2 intact, of course), not to mention five new levels created specifically for the Xbox version of the game. So how come we don't feel giddy? Because the GameCube and the PlayStation 2 have a little something called Tony Hawk 3, the next step in the series, and a leap forward in terms of design and graphics. There's no doubt that Tony Hawk 2X is a complete, polished game, beautiful in every aspect -- but is it enough to bring back gamers that have already scrapped knees on these concrete streets?  Gameplay Seamless. Intuitive. Spectacular, astounding... the best. Everyone copies the Tony Hawk formula for games of this type because no one's even come close to doing better. Like all great technique games you'll be frustrated at the complexity at first, but give it time, and a lot of practice, and you'll find yourself addicted. It's hard to explain the appeal of Tony Hawk, other than to say that it's not a sports game, or at least, it's not confined by those boundaries. The closest comparable experience Tetris, in both its infinite replayability and its twitchy, bite-sized fun. You'll think the world's crazy for the first few hours of play... and you might not even believe them when you beat it for the first time -- but then you'll pop the game back in months later, just to play a little free ride mode for an hour, or maybe four. Tony Hawk 2 made the combo system even more complex, so the incentive to explore and find all the combos available in a level is even greater, and more rewarding. Best of all, it's even more reliant on your ingenuity and skill than simple finding a path. Using the manual to link tricks open up levels to the way you want to play -- just go back through Tony Hawk 1 with the manual, and you'll understand just how different the one simple addition made to the genre.  If there's one criticism of the additions made to 2X, it's that the extra levels are used as a fishing lure -- you have to play through all of Tony Hawk 2 to unlock some of the new levels, and then all of Tony Hawk 1 to unlock the rest. Dastardly? Yes. A good idea? Of course. Will you want to replay the entire game for a few new levels? That depends on how hardcore you are, and whether or not you've got a certain other skating title to play this holiday season.  The level editor's a fantastic way to give yourself specific challenges, or just show off your LEGO building skills -- but it's also home to around 60 of Neversoft's twisted ideas not fit for the final game. Metalheadz kept me busy for hours the first time around, and it'll do the same for you. Now that the editor's been out there for some time, it's beaten out by copycat (but much more elaborate) editors like the one in Z-Axis' Dave Mirra 2 in terms of flexibility, however.  If you're wondering if you're going to get sore thumbs using the Xbox controller with 2X, be ready for a learning curve if you haven't used the Xbox controller for a little while -- the button layout's a bit odd, and there's not game that makes that more apparent than Tony Hawk 2X. If you've played a lot of Tony Hawk with a PlayStation controller, it'll take some getting used to the Xbox controller layout. If you've played the Dreamcast version, you should get up to speed quickly.  Graphics There's no doubt about it -- there has never been a more beautiful version of Tony Hawk on the Xbox. While the architecture is still the same, the textures, details, and models have all been bumped up to make use of the powerful Xbox hardware.  Treyarch has surpassed themselves, taking what they've  learned on the Dreamcast port of Tony Hawk 2 and creating something that really utilizes the architecture, rather than just upping the resolution of existing textures. Not only does the game play fast and smooth, but the textures for the entire game have been completely redone, looking crisper than ever. Skaters are even more complex than the Dreamcast version, and while the differences are subtle, you'll appreciate just how seamless the Skaters look on the Xbox. The realtime lighting gives everything a nice, soft filter that creates levels that look more like environments than empty objects, though the addition of a few extra trash cans and birds does not a wilderness make. It's still as empty as the original, and feels even more odd given how perfect and picturesque everything looks. Does it look better than Tony Hawk 3? That depends on what you're looking at. The characters look more detailed, and the actual textures and edges on the Xbox are better, but you can't even compare the difference in architecture design -- it's an unfair comparison. One's a ghost town, the other, a metropolis.  The one disappointment with Treyarch's original additions to Neversoft's original game is that while the new levels are beautiful, they mimic the general size and architecture of Tony Hawk 2 levels. If you didn't know they were new you'd be hard pressed to tell that these were created exclusively for the Xbox, even with cool tricks like lights that throb with the music in the Disco. That's not to say they aren't great levels -- the construction yard is a dense, small structure with tons of vertical space to explore, and the Disco, while eerily empty, has a lot of tiny secrets that make it well worth unlocking. Or maybe we just like grinding the neon lights on the wall...  Sound The Soundtrack's tight, but it's also intact from Tony Hawk 2. You can opt to use your own music, which is the way to go, especially if you've already heard the soundtrack before. With games like this, where you're spending so much time repeating levels, you'll thank the floor and the ceiling above that you can listen to your own ~mix tapes~ (yeah, I hate putting stuff like that in quotes too) when spending hours trying to get to one area, or beat one specific goal. The sounds are crisper than ever, and seem to sound even better than in other versions. It's probably just me, but in general sound on the Xbox tends to come out loud, clear and smooth when compared to other game consoles.  Multiplayer What a great system launch if you've got friends. Don't answer that one, we'll just assume. You can hook up systems and have full screen LAN multiplayer, with all of you skating simultaneously. You can play three other pals in Graffiti, the fun multi-game where you fight for territory by marking sections with tricks, or you can get a whopping eight people together for Trick Attack. While the PC version of this game allowed you to play like this, the Xbox version is definitely the most complete iteration of this yet. For those of you without access to Ethernet cables or seven other Xbox units, you can always play four player versions of Trick Attack, Graffiti, Tag, HORSE and Free Skate simultaneously. Playing Grafitti with four players is worth the price of admission alone. Tony Hawk 2X is exactly what you expect -- an amazing translation of Tony Hawk1 and  2 with extra touches such as more detailed characters, and crisper textures and details on the environments. Unfortunately, because it's exactly what you expect, this isn't a game that can be recommended to everyone. If you haven't played Tony Hawk 1 or 2 on the other systems, AND you've just picked up an Xbox, then this is definitely worth your purchase. If you've already played the games on the other systems, AND don't own a GameCube or PS2 with which to play Tony Hawk 3, then this might be a game to consider for you launch package. But if you answered no to any of the above, this is probably not worth your money, unless you're a die-hard Tony Hawk completist that must own every version ever made. Despite the new additions, this just can't compete with the gameplay in NeverSoft's latest effort, no matter how polished. I'll make it easy for you -- if you've played the series before, read the scores below. If you haven't played this at all (and if you're the type of person that reads a gaming site for reviews, we seriously doubt that) then check out the PlayStation and Dreamcast reviews of the game, and go blissfully on your way to four-wheeled heaven.Tony Hawk 3 for Xbox is only a few months away...", "date": "Nov 14, 2001"}
