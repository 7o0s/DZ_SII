Sluggish control and a totally lack of refinement plagued the game to the very end.  Laced with a great premise and the promise of a better effort, EA has once again brought for the desire to match up the greatest boxers of all time, and this time around they have made significant strides in getting this game to play better and more smoothly than the last effort.  So whether you are an Ali fan, or go for the likes of Marciano, Bruno, Liston, De La Hoya, Leonard or Lewis; Knockout Kings 2001 delivers much more punch than in the past-with significant improvements in almost every category.   Gameplay The real tweak that gets the most praise, this time around, has got to be the new Dynamic Punch Control.  One of the first bad aspects of the last version of EA's brawler was the lack of any real ability to work up and down a fighter's body and head area.  It was difficult to string the proper punch sequences together to get the right kind of result.  With the implementation of what they are calling Dynamic Punch Control, Knockout Kings 2001 lays that problem to rest-well almost.   While it does do a much better job of allowing players to generate decent repertoires of combinations, learning the ins and outs of effective countering and combinations can be a somewhat taxing experience.  Yet, despite this caveat, it remains fun through and through.  The career mode is where all of this comes together best.  As you work your fighter through the different gyms and ranks, upon completion of each mach you have the opportunity to hit the gymnasium for some much needed training.   Training involves everything from working the bag to sparring with a partner.  Your trainer will have you throwing basic punches at Training Level 1 and then later progressing to complex (low and high) combinations at Training Level 5.  You will be faced with having to survive the final minutes of a round with very little life left and also having to knock out your opponent under the same conditions.  As the training progresses, it does get significantly more difficult in the latter stages.  Particularly when it comes to putting together scripted combinations.   Upon completion of each training phases, you are then awarded points that the CPU applies to your fighter's attributes; such as Stamina, Heart, Cuts, Power and Speed.  Additionally, you are then awarded even more points, based upon your success or lack thereof while training, that you can apply to the same areas yourself.  Careful selection of corner men and application of training points all make for a better, more well-rounded fighter.   As you then move up in rankings, it is only then that the significance of all this preparation really starts to pan out.  Each fighter, at a new level, brings new challenges and styles of boxing into the ring.  Therefore, as in real life, you will have to make adjustments to your fighting tactics to capitalize on each new face you meet in the ring.  If you try to fight a ring dancer toe-to-toe you will certainly get eaten up.  AS such, you will have to find better ways to counter and use more lateral movement-especially if you chose to set up your boxer as a classic ~boxing~ style fighter.  You simply won't be able to match the steps of a Sugar Ray Leonard, so other adjustments in execution (not style) become critical to winning.  And what if you lose?  You will have to fight many tune-ups and rematches to get things back in shape.   Speaking of setting up your boxer, you can easily spend a half hour just playing with all the stuff you can do to set your boxer's personality and style traits.  You pick the gym based upon the types of fighters they are known to produce, then you choose you trainer and cut man based upon the needs that arise from the style choices you make.  You then chose faces, body types, skin color, hair etc.  Then you can choose whether your boxer is a freestyle, slugger, boxer or crab styles.  All of this lends itself to creating a very diverse boxer profile that can then be enhanced by your own ability to manipulate those punches in the ring.  Let's face it, all the training in the world still cannot compensate for someone with slow reaction times and a lack of thumb stamina!   The biggest drawback to this game, in terms of sheer game play is that you want to play it so much, that you get too tired and loose fights because your poor fingers are just worn out!  It took me some time to realize that after ten or so fights, I was just useless and needed real rest.  Cest' la vie!   Other quibbles include the fact that at the end of each fight, when you view your puch-stat statistics, you will find that your fighter has thrown a ridiculous number of punches.  Try around 1100 or so per fight?  What is up with that?  Actually, it will vary depending on the player and the speed that your fighter possesses with this jab and cross-but this is a bit ridiculous.  Nonetheless, what this also means is that, once in the ring, you are steadily busy and involved in the game.  I guess that is one way of looking at it huh?   Besides the numerous male boxers you can create and find, you can also fight as one of the top female boxers including Mia St. John and Lucia Rijker.  This aspect of the gameplay ads another element to the game, but not one with a tremendous degree of appeal.  Later, as you get closer to the top fighters and championship, belts area awarded on your way to the top.  In this PS1 version, however, the fanfare is quite dismal in portrayal and is under par form the normal EA Sports presentation values we have come to know and love.  Then again, it is PS1, and we know that their focus has shifted in the wake of the PS2 launch.  SO hopefully Knockout Kings on PS2 will make up for this faux pas.   Graphics Aesthetically, the game does a very good job of portraying the fight game.  The rings are well proportioned, movement within them is accurate to the point of even allowing cutting off the ring, and the boxers themselves animated quite well in spite of the PS1s apparent limitations.  Various nostalgic boxers are represented rather faithfully, with good skinning techniques and very accurate facial skins.   Complimenting the solid graphical representation of the combatants are the very nice animations employed in the game.  While there is some delay, when frantically generating combos, that can be detected when trying to transition from one punch to the next, it is mostly due to having to allow the combo to complete execution before control is restored back to the player.  This can be viewed as an understandable occurrence or an unacceptable phenomenon.  It really depends on your own personal preference and viewpoint.  Actually, when taking into consideration the need for chaining combos, I subscribe to the former.  The same holds true for Street Fighter, Tekken and DOA so I have to acquiesce to reality.   Conversely, the graphics take a proverbial nosedive when it comes to the crowd...or should I say the pixel blobs that represent a crowd.  This is just amazing to me.  And it is so egregious that I won't belabor the point with tons of gripping.  You get the point!   On the upside, the ring girls make an appearance, and believe it or not, they don't look so bad.  Actually, they put the first renditions of Lara Croft to shame.  So I will give EA the nod for making the time between rounds a bit more entertaining with the inclusion of the babes.   Sound The sounds in the game are quite solid and do a great job of making the game more immersive in scope.  The trainer in the corner always sounds like Danny Devito, but we can live with that too.  Who doesn't like Devito?  Also, the commentary is quite good; as is the production of the pre-fight announcements.  Jimmy Lennon, Jr. handles the announcing, you get Mills Lane, Richard Steele and another Ref, as well as some in-fight and post-fight commentary from Al Bernstein, Max Kellerman and Teddy Atlas.  While these remarks can become quickly repetitive, they nature of the remarks are generally accurate.  The crowd sounds are done up to EA par and the music is a terrific mix of custom Rap tracks laced with retro R&B mixes. If you can deal with the load times and the pixilated crowd effects, Knockout Kings 2001 has a lot to offer in terms of a boxing game true to the nature of the sport.  Terrific graphics for the boxers, couple with some rather impressive motion capturing and a deep Create a Boxer feature, make this game a worthy contender for your PlayStation game library.  Oh!  And let's not forget that at any point in time, you can pit your favorite boxers in classic match-ups.  Ever wanted to know what would happen if you pitted Leonard against Robinson?
