The PSP launch title is a mesmerizing game that first looks like a disco-puzzler full of distracting lights, but after a few rounds, you settle into a rhythm -- a rhythm certainly helped by the smart background music that lends itself well to the flow of the game. When Gameloft first announced its intention to bring to mobile both Lumines and the Nintendo DS puzzler Meteos (both games are made by Q? Entertainment), I was equal parts excited and skeptical. I knew that Gameloft would have no problem bringing over the game mechanics -- they are a perfect fit for mobile -- but there's just no way around the fact that the audio would suffer. And the music is such a major part of the Lumines experience, after all.   Despite an admirable attempt by Gameloft to preserve the musicality of the game, the beep-boop renditions of the classy tracks just don't hold up. And if you are playing the game in public, chances are you'll turn down the volume anyway so as not to disturb those around you. (Such was the case for me when I spent a fat airport delay with the game.) If you are familiar with the PSP version, the loss has a definite impact.   But Gameloft makes up for it elsewhere.   And then some.   As mentioned, the mechanics are intact, and they play beautifully on mobile. In fact, I may like the actual gameplay in the mobile game better, since the screen dimensions shrink the playing field. The PSP's widescreen display is a gorgeous beast to behold, but with such an expansive playing field, I admit that at times, I became overwhelmed. The smaller field in the mobile Lumines is easier to manage, and it allowed me to see more of the game.   Don't fool yourself into thinking that this makes the game easier. Hardly. The mobile game sports some exclusive features that also make it a better play than the PSP edition -- such as the addition of a third color and new block shapes, including a three-wide piece and an S-shaped block. These add an extra dimension to the gameplay that keeps Lumines fresh. Also cool: Boss battles. When playing the arcade mode, you must square off against computer-controlled bosses from time to time. To beat the boss, you need to clear pieces ASAP to shove them into submission.   Lumines retains several of the PSP's mode, such as Time Attack and Skin -- the latter lets you just jump in and play quick games with unlocked backdrops and music. Puzzle mode challenges you to recreate designated shapes to clear the puzzle -- this is one of the hardest modes in the game, and honestly, I never really warmed up to it.   Lumines on the PSP is a sexy game, and even on the smaller screen, Q's puzzler is still a looker. The trance-y backdrops you unlock as you play look great, and the bright colors are just as hypnotic on the smallest screen as the PSP drive-in.  Lumines Mobile is such a smart port of the PSP original that it manages to eliminate one more reason for plunking down $200 for the Sony handheld. I'm serious. The game play is, in my opinion, enhanced by the new colors, shapes, and smaller playing field. It's just more fun when you have better control over the madness and can blame your slip-ups on something else than not being wall-eyed. The degraded music is just something you have to accept. I played the game on an LG VX8000, which has decent audio output, and recognized all of the tunes, but it's just not the same. Regardless of the music, the game is excellent and should be downloaded immediately.", "date": "May 31, 2006"}
