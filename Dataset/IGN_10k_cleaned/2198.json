Well, a little more, actually, but the date on my review of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 reads September 19, 2000, which means just a hair over 13 months passed between the release of one of the finest PlayStation action games ever made and the subsequent arrival of what should go down in history as one of the best twitch-fests on PlayStation 2.  Yes, Tony Hawk 3 is that good.  The perfect skating game remains a small distance out of reach, but if you are not satisfied with your purchase of this game, head examinations are recommended.  What holds Tony Hawk 3 back?  The framerate skips here and there.  A little bit.  And there's no Dayglo Abortions on the soundtrack.  That's more or less it.  Oh, and there's one ramp in Skater Island where I keep falling through the polygons.  Other than that, any complaints you could have would merely be matters of taste, and probably matters of bad taste at that.  This game has Motorhead in it.  And not only does it have Motorhead in it, it has ~Ace of Spades~ in it.  And the Ramones, doing ~Blitzkrieg Bop.~  Words cannot express how hard it is for me to say even a few small words against a game that has ~Ace of Spades~ in it.  Luckily, I don't have to do much of that.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is as brilliant a gameplay experience as it has ever been, amplified with more tricks, more goals, more interactivity, bigger levels, better looks, and...lessee, did I miss anything?  Well, there's the Motorhead, but I already talked about that before.  The scary thing is that there's actually still visible room for the series to improve, meaning Tony Hawk 4 should be fairly appalling.  Gameplay  The trick system as you knew it in Tony Hawk 2 is almost entirely the same -- grind, flip, grab, manual.  The new ~revert~ command is a significant addition, but it doesn't feel as big a leap ahead as the manual was in Tony Hawk 2.  It's a new dimension nonetheless, though, enabling you to combine air and lip tricks off of vert ramps into your street combos. Hit L2 or R2 on the way down from a vert ramp and you perform a little switch pivot, opening up a brief window to ollie or manual and continue the combo.  There are limitations on the use of the revert, though, preventing it from unbalancing gameplay too badly.  The main issue you have to compensate for is a loss of speed -- pulling off a revert slows you down a fair bit.  Thus, you can't just park yourself on a halfpipe and start stringing air tricks together, because your first revert-manual combination will probably rob you of the speed you need to get back up the other side.  Generally, if you want to keep a combination going, you have to follow your revert quickly with a few more grind combos, building up more speed for another go up a vert ramp.  On the subject of new dimensions, note also that this familiar gameplay is brought into worlds of an entirely new scale.  The levels in Tony Hawk 3 are bigger, more detailed, and much more interactive than those in the earlier games, with a heavy emphasis on ~interactive.~  Accomplishing level goals and racking up points frequently involves acting in conjunction with people and things scattered around the stages.  In the frozen Canada level, you bury a snowball thrower under branches and knock a frozen skater's tongue loose from a lightpole.  Suburbia has the downright bizarre ~Help The Thin Man~ goal, similar to the Airport's ticket-delivery challenge.  Los Angeles, of course, has the king of them all, the level-warping earthquake.  Hit the four key rails and the expressway over the stage collapses, opening up an entirely new set of combo possibilities.  As if you needed any more of those, though.  After playing one or two comparatively mediocre skating games in the past year, my appreciation for Neversoft's level design skills just keeps growing and growing.  The smooth, fluid implementation of lines and combos throughout each stage feels so effortless when you play, but it must have demanded hours upon hours of careful tweaking and playtesting in the shop.  It's not like Mat Hoffman, where you can pick out a level and say yes, that one is obviously weaker than these others.  In Tony Hawk 3, the level of quality is uniformly superb.  The rewards for success, of course, are many.  The DVD format means long, high-quality skater videos -- prepare to goggle when you unlock Rodney Mullen's tape -- and the expected crew of hidden skaters is available.  It's easier to complete Tony Hawk 3 than its immediate predecessor, too, since there aren't any cash icons you have to tediously collect (boy, did those drive me nuts last time).  That's not to say the game is easy, though.  Some level goals change from skater to skater, and the difficulty of the competition levels has definitely gone up, demanding much higher scores and fewer bails to get the best medal.  Beginning players may have to settle for bronze and go back for more later -- a raw deal to some, but it extends the game's replay value, makes earning skater tapes more of an achievement, and encourages players to develop serious skills.  Other odds and ends and tweaks improve the quality of the gameplay experience.  The new 3D ~skateshop~ interface is great fun, particularly considering the Chaos license (their Thousand Oaks outlet sold me my current deck two years ago).  New decks are harder to unlock (you have to find them hidden around levels), but they naturally look a lot better on PS2, and there are 30 different grip tape options available right from the start (including a supremely cool Faction logo).  There's one small change to the game interface itself, but it's a significant one: your special meter now builds as you combo, instead of filling once you finish a combo, so you can pull some tricks to start the combination and then segue into special tricks without having to break up the chain.  Create-a-skater is available, complete with a huge variety of cosmetic options and more than enough tricks -- it's right on par with the one in Hawk 2.  Surprisingly enough, though, it's also joined by create-a-park, which we'd always thought would be too much of a modeling challenge to fit into the first PS2 Tony Hawk.  There are multiple texture themes, more than enough parts (including some of the special elements used in the game levels themselves), and plenty of default space to stuff your own skatepark creations into.  And finally, there is the network play mode, the first to appear in a PlayStation 2 game (unless you count silly Japanese games with boring point-to-point modem connections).  Most of the games you're familiar with from split-screen Hawk are there, along with some simple combat-oriented stuff (hey, sometimes you just want to splat people).  We can't test the entire variety of options, but we were able to get online in no time flat with a USB ethernet adapter (both via our work LAN and Dave Z's DSL), and experienced no problems with lag or unreliable connections.  Now if only IT would un-goof the office firewall...  Graphics  Tony Hawk 3 rather goes against the PlayStation 2 grain, relying less heavily on special effects than some other games (Metal Gear Solid 2 being a prime example).  It has a crisp, clear look, and while some spots feature rather plain textures, the worlds still look great and cohere effectively.  The detail level varies from stage to stage, too -- the relatively small Skater Island competition stage (which is still pretty darn huge) has some great textures for the worn wooden walls and graffitied ramps, the Tokyo comp level is an amazing piece of lighting and design, and your bonus for completing the game, the Cruise Ship area, is an absolute knockout in terms of both scale and detail.    The price paid for all that size, and a near-complete lack of fogging and draw-in, are occasional skips in the framerate and drops in resolution.  The Cruise Ship has these, as well as bits of Skater Island, some of Tokyo, and especially post-quake Los Angeles, which probably has the most level animation mixed with the longest draw distance.  Having a Tony Hawk game run at 60 frames per second is still an awesome leap forward for the game, improving control and kicking up the visual pace dramatically, but the glitches do nag occasionally.  There are also a few bugs in the polygon architecture -- like I say, there's a ramp at Skater Island I can crash through every time.  Unlike the levels, though, the skaters themselves are nearly flawless.  All of the game's animations are completely redone to take advantage of the framerate, and the result are perfectly clean, smooth motions.  There are many new tricks, and new movements to go along with familiar ones.  Skaters react more realistically to the impact of landing, and the rail-balance animations correspond in precise detail to the movements of the new balance meter.  Crash, and you even get to mess with the level textures -- there are some beautiful bloodstain decals that streak across the concrete after a particularly heavy slam.  Sound  There's Motorhead in this game.  There's ~Ace of Spades~ in this game.  Pardon me if I'm repeating myself here a bit, but I consider this a very important point.  Though ~Ace of Spades~ is certainly the standout, the entire licensed soundtrack ranges from good to great.  The rock/hip-hop mix is about the same as in Hawk 2 (there's none of the electronica/pop influence from Mat Hoffman), and the list is a continuous parade of talented names.  The Ramones -- classic punk, check.  AFI -- contemporary hardcore, check.  Rollins Band -- hard rock, check.  KRS One -- old-school, check.  Del -- new-school, check.  The Reverend Horton Heat -- well, you either like it or you don't.  One way or the other, there's a skip track command, as well as a completely customizable playlist, but I doubt you'll want to pass over many of these songs.  The total sound package in Hawk 3 is one that begs to be pumped through a quality surround-sound system.  Ambient sounds around the levels are far more dense and noticeable in this game (things like chatting passersby, car engines, machinery, and other environmental noises), and effects familiar from the earlier Hawks are much richer and more effective.  When you bail in this game, even the sound effects hurt -- the basic ~thwack!~ from the PlayStation games has been replaced by a meaty, textured ~CRUNCH!~, the perfect accompaniment to the massive new bloodstains.Neversoft -- rips hardcore, check.I have a couple of complaints about the graphics here, of course, but that's just for the sake of covering myself.  By all means, trample the homeless and innocent small children in your stampeding rush to own this game.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a great debut for the franchise on PlayStation 2, bringing an already-first-rate gameplay concept into a new graphical world completely intact, and it holds out the promise of even better next-generation skateboarding action to come in the next few years.And it has Motorhead in it.  ~Ace of Spades.~  $%&@IN' LEMMY IN THIS GAME, DAMMIT! GO!  BUY!  NOW!", "date": "Oct 31, 2001"}
