For all the delicate posturing you're likely to do in between rounds of typically off-kilter mini-games lunacy, Wario's first Wii outing is all about making a complete and utter tit of yourself. And if you can do it in the company of people who pretend to be your friends but really only hang around with you because you're the funny one they like to laugh at when you're not about, then all the better.   At least, that's the theory. You see, much like Wario Ware's previous home console offering on GameCube, Smooth Moves attempts to broaden the series' traditional scope as a solo handheld offering into a multiplayer game of ritual humiliation and public shame. Interestingly, rather than creating a fully-fledged multiplayer experience, Nintendo's banking on the fact that watching one or two people faffing with the remote at a time will be entertaining enough to keep the crowds amused.    Although it might seem strange to start with the multiplayer aspects of a Wario Ware game, Nintendo's design decision has had a significant effect on the latest franchise entry as a whole. The upshot, not wanting to get too ahead of ourselves here, is that Smooth Moves is distinctly lacking in the series' trademark breadth and depth. Thankfully, while Smooth Moves might be wanting in some areas, Intelligent Systems - working alongside the original Wario Ware team - has managed to rectify some of the more glaring missteps of Wario Ware Touched.   For all its quirky charm, Touched stumbled thanks to the decision to base each group of mini-games around a particular stylus gesture. Ultimately this robbed the game of its all-important rapid-fire assess-and-react game mechanics and the whole thing tended to sag around its distinctly repetitive proceedings. Smooth Moves rectifies things by introducing a pose system, constantly switching and mixing the actions the game demands - this way, you'll never quite know what to expect next.    Admittedly, most of the poses are more of a superficial flourish - in practical terms, 'The Remote', 'The Sketch Artist', 'The Elephant' and 'The Mohawk' are exactly the same, merely requiring you to point the Wiimote at the screen. The same is true with other poses, such as the vertical 'The Umbrella' and 'The Janitor' or the horizontal 'The Handlebar' or 'The Chauffeur' - however, part of Smooth Moves' appeal comes from a player's willingness to get into the spirit of silliness.   In terms of actual mini-game content, everything's pretty much as you'd expect. Whether you're thrusting the remote to jam your fingers up a giant nose or flapping your arms in the rather lovely 3D Balloon Fight makeover, the usual crude art style and surreal sense of humour makes for yet another genuinely amusing entry in the Wario Ware cannon. Having said that, there's simply not the same level of ingenuity and imagination in Smooth Moves as there was in the original game, or the arguably superior Twisted. It's hard to say whether that's just down to familiarity with the formula or not but boss fights in particular - aside from a brilliant take on Star Fox and a deliriously enjoyable dance workout - feel flat and predictable.     Which isn't to say there's not a lot of fun to be had with Smooth Moves. The numerous stages in the single-player game have enough micro-games each to warrant several return visits once your first play-through (probably taking a couple of hours) is complete. As is always the way with Wario Ware too, the utterly random, frantic pace makes it the ideal companion for killing half an hour or so, even months after you've exhausted everything the game has to offer.   Here's another sticking point though: unlike the first Wario Ware - and Twisted in particular - the roster of unlockables in Smooth Moves is disappointingly anorexic. Whereas Twisted featured literally hundreds of bonus games and novelties, the Wii game's extras total a paltry six - most of which you'll uncover as you make your way through the main mode. It's a serious oversight, especially with a game as naturally swift as Wario Ware, and the outcome is that you'll find yourself relying on the game's much-touted multiplayer offerings as a means of extended Smooth Moves longetivity.    As with the rest of the game though, these end up being an entertaining enough diversion, but fail to offer anything like the deceptive depth of either the GBA single-player games or the GameCube's multiplayer-focussed reworking of the original. Split into various micro-game modes and a couple of standalone endeavours, multiplayer games are designed for up to 12 people, generally taking it in turns to wield the Wiimote. 'Survival' (most notable for the airborne, angelic representations of your Miis with disturbingly rippling torsos) sees players passing the baton to complete a series of micro-games - one fluff-up leading to Game Over for that player. It's a nice enough idea but is seriously unbalanced, relying, as it does, on familiarity with each of the tasks at hand if you're going to succeed.   'Balloon' makes a welcome return from the GameCube title, with players desperately pumping a balloon in between rounds in the hope it will burst during an opponent's turn, while 'Bomb' offers a slight reworking of the same theme, tasking players with passing around explosives. Each time you complete a micro-game, you're rewarded with the chance to hand over the bomb - fail the task and you have to keep going. Obviously, if the fuse runs out while you've got it in your possession, it's Game Over. Last on the micro-games front then is the bizarre 'Lifeline'. Here, essentially, you take it in turns to complete rounds of games, with an extra 'lifeline' awarded to the winner at the end of each. Once all that's out the way, players take it in turns to sever lines suspending their Miis over a crocodile-infested pool. Being Wario, it's impossible to tell if you're severing your own lifeline or your opponent's - run out of supports and the loser meets a bit of a bitey demise.    All that remains then are the three mini-games, ranging from the relatively sensible to the utterly abstract. 'Darts', for instance, offers a surprisingly decent recreation of it's real-life counterpart - assuming you're not co-ordinationally-challenged. Meanwhile, 'Bungee Buddies' uses both the Nunchuck and Wiimote, with two players taking charge of one each. The basic idea is to physically jump over the obstacles ahead on the track and the game measures your compatibility based on your success at the end of it. It's stupid, but offers a surprisingly entertaining and energetic challenge. Lastly then, is Star Nose. Using a similar control scheme to the previous game, two players tilt either the Nunchuck or Wii Remote to guide a great big nasal appendage down a corridor in an attempt to snuffle three pieces of fruit first - or, at least, avoid exploding. It's silly and utterly throwaway, but it'll make you giggle for a few rounds.As with Touched on the DS, Smooth Moves offers a brilliant introduction to the Wii's unique control system. In fact, part of the game's joy is its showcasing of the vast number of possibilities the Wiimote offers - and hopefully other developers are taking note here. Unfortunately, Touched's shortcomings rear their ugly head again and the result is a game which is wildly entertaining, thoroughly stupid but much too brief and far too shallow to offer more than a passing diversion. Undeniably, Wario Ware is still one of the most original, refreshing franchises around at the moment. However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to recommend new entries when they neglect to recognise the importance of countering the series' inherent brevity with plenty of compulsive peripheral content - especially given how successful both GBA games were here. Sure, it's Wario Ware and, yes, it's fun - it's just a shame that even the much-touted multiplayer focus can't quell the feeling you're being short changed.", "date": "Jan 9, 2007"}
