Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/05/gitaroo-man-lives-review", "text": "Here's an interesting little gem that originally shipped for the PS2 back in 2002. Gitaroo Man, by developer Inis, curiously evaded the spotlight when it came out, even though most critics loved its crazy style and addictive gameplay. Regardless, it failed to make much of an impact in the marketplace. So here's a second chance. Going by the title Gitaroo Man Lives!, it packs everything that made the original game fun and unique in a portable package. And since it's on PSP, it even has a few extras.  The game stars an insecure adolescent who goes by the name U-1. He's a typical kid who wants respect, friends and most of all, girls. Only U-1 wants one girl in particular, and it just so happens to be the one he's most afraid to approach. One day his routine life goes haywire when his dog, which talks, hands him a funky guitar. Turns out the guitar came from space and U-1 has inadvertently inherited the role of Gitaroo Man. As such, he's charged with keeping things decent and awesome. After prodding from his dog, he reluctantly takes the job and goes to war against the evil Gravillians.    Not just any war, but a war where he who rocks hardest, wins. That's where players step in and show their stuff. Gitaroo Man Lives!, just like its predecessor, is a rhythm-based action game, like Parappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy. Fans of both these titles know that's a very good thing. But what differentiates Gitaroo Man from both of them is how players interact with music. Instead of simply tapping the right buttons when they appear on screen, players need to use the analog stick to trace melodies, too. It sounds simple, and to some it is, but it nevertheless adds an enjoyable twist.  Still, certain gamers may find the game difficult because of it. Truthfully, following the ~Trace Line~ as it winds around the screen and having to blast out notes accurately isn't all that simple, especially in later stages. It's definitely a rewarding experience once accustomed, but for a while it can get overwhelmingly aggravating. Fortunately, the game actually includes a helpful tutorial to aid those in need, and it also features a range of difficulty settings. All of which make it very difficult to not like Gitaroo Man. Try as one might, it offers plenty of reasons to get in the groove.    Not only that, each of the game's stages split into different phases. These let players attack the Gravillians in one phase, by playing well, then defend in another, again by performing well. The defense phases in particular can get pretty hectic, as players need to contend with an onslaught of notes on-screen. Mess up too many times and it's curtains for Gitaroo Man. If players do well, on the other hand, then stages switch to the final phase. Here, it's all about doing well on a killer solo to send the Gravillians packing. These multi-tiered stages are a fun and different way of dividing the action. It helps the blur the line between rhythm-based games and plain old action games.    What's more, Gitaroo Man boasts a genuinely eclectic sense of style. This goes for the game's look, from character design to color palate and texture work, to the musical score. A game like Gitaroo Man simply wouldn't work without these elements, especially the selection of catchy tunes, and luckily it just nails it. It's all very quirky and Japanese, of course, so it may not appeal to everyone. Having said that, the game has super high levels of geek appeal, plus there's a good chance anyone who happens to see it running on a PSP will want to linger and stare a while.   Gitaroo Man Lives! Makes the jump to the PSP and never misses a beat. Sure, its still a short game, even with the addition of new tracks and multiplayer modes, but its nevertheless unique and still very rewarding. Plus, it actually makes a fine portable title, which is as important as any other factor when it comes to PSP titles.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
