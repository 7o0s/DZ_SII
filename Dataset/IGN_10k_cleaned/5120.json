I don't recall any expansion going as smoothly as this, with the possible exception of Legacy of Ykesha.   Of course, Sony's hand had been forced by a user revolt, led in part by cartoonist Woody Hearn, who runs GUcomics. He called for a boycott of the OOW release, originally planned for July. The EverQuest community, already in a snit over the poor quality and extreme difficulty of the previous expansion, Gates of Discord, was more than ready to revolt.   In addition to a two-month delay on OOW to properly test it, Sony held a summit at its San Diego offices, with representatives from every server. A lot of spleen was vented that day, and many guilds as a whole volunteered to test out the new expansion.    For the longest time, testing of EverQuest expansions meant making a new character on a beta test server. What Sony finally figured out was that people do have an attachment to their character that they've spent years building up. So for Omens, Sony copied players' own characters over to the beta test servers. Whole guilds were copied to the beta test servers, and 10,000 players eventually took part in the testing.   The end result is a very solid expansion. Veteran players may remember the disastrous Shadows of Luclin expansion, where the servers had to come down several times a day for about a week for emergency patches. That's not the case here. There have been relatively few patches, and in most cases, it was a few zones, not the whole server. Some long-time players are saying Omens is the smoothest expansion they've ever seen.   Are You Experienced?   So what do we get with Omens of War? Well, for starters, new and extremely appealing experience zones. The zones of Planes of Power and Gates of Discord have been rendered irrelevant on some levels. One of the things that angered many players was that PoP and GoD locked away experience zones behind raid targets.    The architecture just gets better and better.  For example, with the Luclin expansion, the ultimate raid target was Vex Thal. Experience-wise, it's terrible, probably the worst in the game. But the drops were unreal by previous standards, and are still good by today's standards. To get to raid Vex Thal required a raid force to take down other targets. But Luclin's experience zones were wide open for anyone to go and grind away at gaining experience.   However, you couldn't go to the elemental planes in Planes of Power, the zones with the best single-group experience in all of the game up to that point. You had to kill several gods/demigods -- Terris Thule, Saryn, Bertoxxulous, Mithaniel Marr, Agnarr, Rallos/Talon/Valon Zek -- plus other difficult targets.    This was unpopular, as people didn't like that the standard six-man hunting zone was hidden away behind numerous 70-man raid targets. The feeling was it widened the gulf between the haves from the have nots even more than already existed.   GoD was even worse. Kod'Taz was a great experience zone, but to get there required six flags from six separate zones, and they had to be done by a single group. Those zones were unbelievably difficult. I have failed every trial, for one reason or another.   Is it me, or are the player characters uglier than the creatures we kill?  With OOW, that problem is solved. You can stroll right into the best experience zones, like Wall of Slaughter, The Bloodfields or Muramite Proving Grounds and get better experience than you would in the Plane of Earth or Kod'Taz. Of course, you will also get your ass kicked a lot harder than you ever would anywhere else in the game.    Hunting dragorns -- dragon-like creatures -- in Wall of Slaughter is the easiest and hardest thing you can do. It's a zone similar in setup to the Lake of Ill Omen, but no one under level 65 belongs here. My poor enchanter has been shredded when mesmerisation spells have failed or worn off. If you aren't a tank, you won't survive more than a few hits in this place.   WoS lives up to its name. Creatures respawn ridiculously fast and there's lots and lots of them. The zone has handled over 70 players, in groups of six, with no lack of targets to kill. Unlike infamous experience grind zones like Sebilis (I miss that madhouse), Karnor's Castle or Bastion of Thunder, WoS doesn't have camp names. When I find a group, I'm simply told their location and go there.      The experience is great and there are some fantastic drops in the zone. It's got tons of mobs that respawn quickly, which keeps many players happy.   However, WoS is not perfect. Sony placed a half dozen chimeras right at the zone in where players congregate while looking for a group. Players are constantly being jumped and running for the zone because of this. If you are away from your computer when this happens, you're as good as dead. The placement of these chimeras, with no safe room like there is in BoT, is really annoying.   Experience-wise, I find WoS to be equal to or slightly better than the Plane of Earth, with my characters getting around three percent alternative experience per kill. The result is immediately obvious. Bastion of Thunder is now as dead as Sebilis. The last time I was there, there were nine people in the zone. It used to have 30-50. I tried to start a group but people openly laughed at my invitations to come to BoT.   Here's a little perspective: one day I did a Lost Dungeons of Norrath adventure with my enchanter. It took an hour (the group wasn't very good) and I got 20 percent of an AAXP point. Then I went to WoS, found a group and got the same amount of experience in under 20 minutes. So why should I ever do another LDoN adventure again?   Like practically every other expansion, OOW offers such an increase in value over the previous ones that it effectively kills the expansions behind it. For two nights in a row, I spent four hours per night on a painful Vxed flagging adventure.    The end result was multiple deaths, much frustration, going to sleep much later than I intended (and being a zombie at work as a result) and not getting the flag. Four hours per night in WoS would have gotten me about 7-8 AA points and spell runes. So again, why should I bother with GoD?   With OOW, Sony raised the level cap from 65 to 70, and the scale from 66 up is excruciating. Sony said that in theory you could get to level 70 in BoT but I don't think anyone at the company actually tried doing it. One warrior told me he'd spent six hours in BoT and didn't even have a solid yellow bubble of experience, 20 percent experience, to show for it.   With the level cap raised comes new spells. Like in Planes of Power, the level 66 to 70 spells are gotten through runes dropped by creatures, but only in the OOW zones. The level 69 and 70 spells are nodrop, so no buying the rune from other players, you have to farm it yourself. These spells are powerful. Shaman buffs in particular are sending player stats to the moon.    An enchanter's work is never done.  For example, the level 70 shaman spell Talisman of Wunshi is not just an upgrade to Focus of Soul. Sure, it raises your maximum hitpoints by 680 (FoS was 544) and your strength and dexterity by 85 (FoS raised them by 75 and 70, respectively). But it also raises your cap on strength and dexterity by 85. FoS did not raise your stats cap.   The runes for these spells only drop in the toughest of OOW zones - Bloodfields, Wall of Slaughter and Muramite Proving Grounds, among others. All I can say is, you're going to earn them.   An Epic Pain In The   With Ruins of Kunark in 2000, Sony introduced the epic weapon, an individual quest for each class that gave them a weapon or item of great power. The epics varied wildly in their difficulty; the rogue epic was considered a joke, while the mage and shadow knight epics were unmitigated nightmares. I once saw a chart from Sony on how many epics were in the game. There were 14,000 rogue epics and 1,100 shadow knight epics.   Over time, epics lost their value, especially for melees. The ranger epic was worth hanging on to, since Swiftwind/Earthcaller were still a deadly combination, and even the top bards in the game still use their Singing Short Sword. But that's it. Players had clamored for new epics for some time, and OOW delivers.   The new epic comes in two stages. The ~1.5~ epic is supposed to be relatively easy, doable with one or two groups max. The 2.0 epic is supposed to be much, much harder and will take months to complete. Sony expected the 1.5 epics to be done in a few weeks but the 2.0 epics to take months.      Whereas the Kunark epic weapons were always limited to the Kunark and Antonica continents, the new 1.5/2.0 epics span all of the game zones, which has players grumbling they will need to buy certain expansions to get their epic (a lot of people skipped GoD because early adopters hated it so much).    Also, Sony cleverly stuck a lot of epic drops in zones that people have long ignored, like Howling Stones and Siren's Grotto. Howling Stones hasn't seen this much traffic in ages.   While Sony tried to keep the epics of equal difficulty, since there was such huge variance in the 1.0 epics, they still goofed here and there. The biggest problem I've encountered thus far is the warrior epic. To get it, you have to collect three items, which is not easy, then turn them in to a final mob, kill it, and loot the epic off his corpse.   Can you imagine the potential for problems? It should be obvious to everyone, except whoever designed this epic. Here's what happened to me and a friend: first, the zone where this fight takes place has atrocious lag. With just my raid force of a dozen, the lag was worse than Wall of Slaughter with 100 people in it. Some poor design went into City of Dranik.   Second, if you don't kill this guy and he despawns, then you have to start the entire epic all over again from the beginning. My friend petitioned a GM after we failed to find out if he could get his stuff back and a GM did arrive, but he said he could not reimburse my friend for the pieces. It was either succeed or he's SOL.   So here we were, desperately looking for friends or anyone to help us. What happened? A guild got wind of this failure and tried to kill steal us for an easy epic. This is not surprising as they have the worst reputation on the server for unscrupulous behavior and are despised server-wide.    Thankfully, they wiped, too. When we reassembled people, their response was to train us, to keep us from getting the epic. Another call to the GMs was placed. Finally we got the kill, my friend looted the corpse and got his epic. He was a nervous wreck from this experience.    [Update: Since writing this, Sony has issued several fixes to the epic fights, and now the warrior receives a flag, so that he can do the final fight over and over until he wins, and no one else can steal it. However, that fix is bugged but should be fixed soon.]   The dragorns don't walk, they run. FAST.  If there's a disappointment, it's that most of the 1.5 and 2.0 epics replace your 1.0 epic. The caster and priest epics all go in the primary slot, so you can't wield your 1.0 and 1.5 epic at the same time, with a few exceptions. The cleric epic is a shield, which goes in the off-hand slot. Rangers, bards and warriors can also mix their 1.0 with their 1.5/2.0 epic if they so wish as well.   I can tell you right now that several of these epics are nowhere near two-group encounters. The final mob for the warrior epic repeatedly slaughtered our raiding force of 24.    Another painful fight was for the cleric epic. There were 30 of us in Lesser Faydark and we were obliterated in minutes. The final fight for the enchanter epic, in the Plane of Mischief, is also reported to be a 40-man battle.   Plus, some classes are saying their epic isn't worth it. Druids and enchanters in particular are being pretty noisy, although enchanters are very upset right now, if the message board on The Runes is any indication.    The warrior 1.5 epic (foreground, in the ogre's left hand) and shaman 1.5 epic (background, the lion-head staff).  Warriors aren't terribly impressed with their epic and bards are also grousing. The shaman 1.5 epic is considered the easiest of the bunch to obtain, while the warrior and enchanter epics look like the toughest.   It's a quandary for Sony. They made items of such immense power in the Plane of Time and GoD zones that the epics either had to have insane stats and effect, or they simply would be not much better than Time/GoD gear.    They ended up going with the latter. As a cleric, looking at the walk-through for my 1.5 epic, I can tell you right now, I'd rather have an Aegis of Blackscales from Kod'Taz than go through the trouble for the new cleric epic shield. As bad as the GoD trials are, the epic is worse, and it's just too difficult for a part-time player like me who doesn't have the connections and allies.     Other Stuff   Sony introduced a Task system, similar to what is in Star Wars: Galaxies. There are four kinds of tasks: exploration, shady meetings with Wayfarer agents, collecting four items and killing ten beasts. Tasks can be done by players from levels 5 to 65.   Tasks tend to favor solo classes, like paladins and rangers. People who will need help, such as an enchanter, will be hard-pressed to get the help they need. If you get a task of collecting some items from Howling Stones, you will have to convince friends to come along, and they will only get experience from the mobs killed, but not the reward on the final turn-in. At the lower levels, this might be fun, but for people in the 60s, the reward isn't worth the time.   Another feature is voice macros. This is perfect for ADD-types like me, who might be tempted to look at another monitor and start surfing rather than pay attention. Voice macros can call players to fight, back off and for a heal.    The voices themselves can be a bit of a joke. One female dwarf cleric complained her guild was calling her Rosie O'Donnell after hearing the female dwarf voice. Also, the potential for abuse abounds. One friend went so nuts with it I had to turn off my speakers.   The new graphics engine is getting rave reviews, but to be honest, I don't care. My sole concern is the game running smoothly. If graphics made the game, Earth and Beyond wouldn't have been shut down. Shadows in particular were pointless and I had to shut them off, as they caused too much lag on my screen.    That said, I can't help but stop and look at the water in places, especially when I'm at a low elevation. While running to BoT one day I had to stare in amazement at the realism of the water surrounding the entrance in the Plane of Tranquility. It was truly something spectacular.    A dragorn wants to give me a kiss. Also impressive is the bump mapping, giving the walls and buildings in OOW a worn, realistic look. It's nice, but as I say, I've got mobs to kill, AA to accumulate.   All told, Sony did a great job on the expansion. Omens of War is a very good evolutionary step in the game. It doesn't bring anything really big to the game, the way PoP and Lost Dungeons of Norrath did. It simply improves on the current style of gameplay.    The design and artwork is outstanding, it's solid and almost bug-free and has revitalized the game in many ways. I'm sorry to see the PoP zones get abandoned, but perhaps interest will return in due time.    You never run out of creatures to kill in this place. It's good to see Sony seriously listening to its player base. Years ago, their idea of community relations was to basically laugh at anyone's suggestions. Thankfully, there's been a regime change down in San Diego and player requests are being heard, although enchanters may disagree with me.If EQ wasn't your cup of tea before, this won't change your mind. If you left in boredom, or frustration with Gates, then this may give you new interest.", "date": "Oct 13, 2004"}
