Hiding behind its spooky ambience and simple interface is a rich story and very solid puzzling.  However, despite the rewarding journey, the destination is rather disappointing.  If the journey, and not the destination, is what is important to you, then Barrow Hill might be worthy of a pick-up.   The story in Barrow Hill is somewhat clouded in mystery.  It is told from a first-person perspective.  A car breaks down and the player is stranded, unable to leave the area around Barrow Hill.  There is a protective barrier that prevents anyone inside the barrier from getting out.  Exploring the dark and frightening woods will eventually lead to a service station, caf and hotel.  Throughout the entire game, only two people are found alive, and they never stand toe to toe with the player.  The emptiness adds to the ambience.  The player must figure out what happened to everyone and how to get out of Barrow Hill.    The interface is simple and standard fare.  Nothing adds or detracts in this area, it just exists and is functional, fulfilling its purpose.  The graphics are beautifully done.  It is easy to travel from screen to screen, as load time is almost nil.  There's no way to skip over the rare cutscene, which is only annoying near the end of the game and never so much that it detracts greatly from the enjoyment of the game.  Finding interactive objects is never an issue, although most interactive objects have little use.  Also, for some, the player will need to come back later to use them, since many of them can't be taken.  This isn't obvious until late in the game, though, and by then, the ease of traveling around and the familiarity with the environments, having explored most of them thoroughly, makes this a non-issue.  The sound may be one of the brightest spots of the game, with appropriate sound effects and eerie music definitely adding a feeling of tension.  Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't quite live up to the music's promise.   The gameplay is a mixed bag.  The ambience sets you on edge, but there is nothing in the game that is really all that scary.  There are no jumping out of chair moments - unless you count the bird coming out of the trashcan which has no bearing on the game and is a rather silly event to even be put in.  That moment actually feels so out of place because of the nature of the rest of the action.  The puzzles are fun and quite solvable.  There is a lot of written backstory in the game and by reading it, all the clues to solving puzzles can be found.  The game is non-linear, so there's no set sequence of events to follow.  This encourages exploration and makes for a lot of fun.  There are 'game-ending' moments, but as long as the setting isn't turned off in the options menu, the game won't actually end, but the player will just restart right before the moment occurred.  The final puzzle is multi-step and a lot of fun, making the game worth a playthrough.  The only issue is that the ending is ambiguous and somewhat frustrating after a solidly told story has unfolded.      Most of the problems with the game aren't with the game itself, but with the expectations of the features that hype the game.  It is misleading to say that Barrow Hill involves solving 'puzzles using real archaeological techniques'. This gives a high expectation of something fun and exciting, but the only techniques to be found are using a metal detector and a trowel, which is really disappointing.  This is a minor gripe, though, since the puzzles are fun, even without exciting 'real archaeological techniques' included in the package.Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle is a solid addition to the point-and-click adventure library.  It has an interesting story that stays that way until the end, where it weakens quite a bit.  The puzzles are fun and involved and all the clues needed to complete the game are easily found throughout the various beautifully rendered environments.  The soundtrack really adds a lot of tension and ambience to the game.  If Barrow Hill lacks in anything besides the ending, it would be with its marketing, as the archaeological techniques advertised are really nothing to write home about.  Adventure fans would not go wrong buying this game.", "date": "Aug 28, 2006"}
