It's a blessing that allows me to listen to the radio and not get annoyed by the likes of Nickelback and Avril Lavigne, and it's a curse that leads to me being a social outcast when chatting with one of the millions of music snobs in this country.    Do you like poppy beats, infectious rhythms and vapid lyrics like I do? If so, I have good news: SingStar '90s is my favorite track list yet in the Sony franchise.   Although it's conquered the United Kingdom and made itself a super-success story across the pond, SingStar is still a niche title here in the states and its previous four PS2 installments -- SingStar Rocks, SingStar Pop, SingStar '80s and SingStar Amped -- have been met with the kind of apathy usually reserved for tax law and voting. Sadly, SingStar '90s probably won't change that due to the fact that its presentation/menus/modes are the exact same as the other games, but it will provide 30 new songs and six medleys for fans to get down with at their next party.     If the docile tones of Natalie Imbruglia, Savage Garden and Sixpence None the Richer are calling you to your first SingStar experience, you'll find that gameplay is decidedly simple and easy to pick up. You'll choose a song, the track will start while either a music video or the live feed from your EyeToy plays on the screen, and on top of that imagery will be blank tubes. The lyrics will be on the bottom part of the screen and as the player-one blue or player-two red flows across the syllables, you sing. Your voice shows up on screen as color and is positioned depending on how high or low you're singing. The challenge is to get your vocal color to fill in the blank bars. Completely botch the move, and you'll be rated awful. Nail it and you'll be rated cool and grab some points. When the track is over, your scores are tallied to give you a total and a rank from Tone Deaf to Rising Star to Super-Frickin' Awesome  okay, maybe that last one isn't in there.   It's an established form of vocal scoring that Sony has no intention of changing anytime soon. Toss in the occasional EyeToy image (it signifies that the camera is about to record a few seconds called a ~Golden Moment~ that you can watch later) and sparkly ~Golden Note~ bars (these lines are worth more points), and you've got the basics of how SingStar '90s plays. You'll take this knowledge into solo signing, two-player Battles, two-player duets, and eight-person Pass the Mic parties/head-to-head competitions.   It's exactly what it looks like. If you're not new to the SingStar setup, those last two paragraphs really wasted your time because you knew all of that -- '90s changes nothing except the main menu color scheme (green this time). That said, you have to make a choice -- do you or don't you like SingStar? If you've been against the other versions, this one won't change your mind. If you loved the other ones, you're golden.    Let's look at what this game has going for it and against it.    To begin with, it's important that anyone who purchases SingStar '90s realizes that it is a party game. Sony's been making a rather large push lately to establish the PlayStation 2 as a casual gamer machine, and SingStar is one of its crown jewels of this everyman platform. Each song in the game is unlocked when you purchase it, there are no careers for single player or multiplayer, and scoring is pretty generous. Now, although this is disappointing for folks who live alone but still dream of being in Technotronic, I'm not going to come down on the game for its party focus.   Why? Because singing with other people is a blast. This morning I've had a handful of IGN editors walk in, pick up the mic and rock out. None have left without a smile. You and a friend trying to keep up with Sir Mix A Lot is guaranteed to be a good time, and everyone loves to watch Paula Abdul dance with that rapping cat.   Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm a Rock Band devotee and love going home and singing my career for fans and loot. Would I die for a fleshed out solo career in SingStar? Of course, but in reality, it wouldn't fit with Sony's plan. A complicated solo mode would ruin the company's ~pick up and play~ atmosphere that actually works really well. Think about how much you have to focus and train to hit every note in Rock Band. Sure, that's fun, but if my mom wants to jump behind the mic for one song, the thought of failing out or crippling the band is a bit intimidating. You can't fail in SingStar and even the Hard difficulty setting is pretty easy to excel at if you know the words.     The game is designed for anyone to be a rock star.   While we're talking a bit about Rock Band, it's probably worth pointing out that a lot of people dig the constant on-screen line and vocal arrow combination over SingStar's paint the blank bar mechanic. As a karaoke game nut, I can say that I do enjoy the Karaoke Revolution/Rock Band style for vocals more, but I've never gotten hung up in a song because of the SingStar model. Most of the time I'm singing with friends in SingStar and laughing between lyrics. I really don't worry about nailing each line -- neither would most casual gamers -- so not being able to see where my pitch is before I get to the actual lyrics is fine by me. And if you know the song, it's relatively simple to nail the range right out of the gate.   On a final side note, does anyone remember how completely ridiculous the ~Steal My Sunshine~ video is? Oh my God.So, yeah. Another SingStar has arrived, and if you've dug the other titles, you should have no qualms tossing down your $30 -- $50 with two microphones -- to pick up this disc packing Hootie and the Blowfish, the Gin Blossoms and more rad '90s bands on it. However, it's important to remember that if you had any qualms with this franchise, they're on this disc.", "date": "Feb 13, 2008"}
