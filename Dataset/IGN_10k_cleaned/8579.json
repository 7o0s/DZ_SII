{"name": "Mad Tracks", "name_review": "Mad Tracks Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/02/mad-tracks-review", "text": "Mad Tracks is an original Live Arcade game brought to you from the good people over at Load Inc., a cadre of former Ubisoft employees. Although priced at 800 Microsoft Points, Mad Tracks is a passable first entry on XBLA even if the party-game racer comes off as a cheap Mario Kart clone with little personality.   The 15 events are a combination of typical races or arcade mini games. Using wind-up toy cars, you'll drive around, picking up power-ups and shooting your friends with missiles. There are 12 total power-ups ranging from lock-on freeze missiles to EMP blasts. A highlight of Mad Tracks is a rather impressive physics system. The cars do have a nice sense of weight and control rather well.    The mini-games give Mad Tracks a healthy dose of much-needed atmosphere. You'll drive off a ramp and aim for a bulls-eye on a dartboard track -- knock the eight ball in the corner pocket in a pool game, and drive around a bowl and try to avoid rubber balls. It's simple stuff, but can be fun with a friend -- even better with four. Yay.   Eight ball, corner pocket. Part of the appeal of Mad Tracks is driving your small toy car in large real world environments. Your racer is about the size of a Hot Wheels car and it's interesting to zip around the kitchen table. It's like Little Big Planet on wheels, but not nearly as fun to look at.    Multiplayer is where this game excels, although with only 15 events Mad Tracks does get old quickly. But with four-player split screen or online play, you can have yourself a fun time, although this is definitely one of those games that's more fun when your friends are in the room with you. And as an online ~party~ game, it doesn't make much sense not to have a party system in which you and your buds can race continually. Instead you'll have to find each other again.   Visually, Mad Tracks suffers from a bit of blockyness. The textures aren't particularly impressive, and while the environments are straight out of ~Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,~ the cars are rather boring to look at. Load Inc. will try to tell you that there are 12 different cars, but we're not sure if you'll notice the difference. At least it comes with a variety of camera angles and a solid frame-rate. During the Speed Racer match you actually feel a sensation of speed faster than Forza. Yay.   The soundtrack is a decent collection of videogame music infused with dance elements, whatever the heck that means. Just turn on the old custom soundtrack if it gets old.    Eventually Load will release two downloadable packs, each with 15 more missions. They will cost ~about half the price~ of the 800-point full game. Still, you'll be hard-pressed to spend more money on this slightly-overpriced title as it is. If you enjoy local multiplayer and have a few extra controllers, Mad Tracks is worth looking into.", "date": "Jun 2, 2007"}
