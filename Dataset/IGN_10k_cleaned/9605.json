That's not necessarily a bad thing though; it is, after all, a very small expansion pack to an already simplistic, extremely straightforward game. Unfortunately, while it succeeds at virtually everything it sets out to do (which is most welcome), it just doesn't set out to do very much. This may not be a problem for gamers who just want a slightly refreshing experience rooted in the original gameplay setup, but is that enough for everyone?   The original flOw, developed by thatgamecompany, was a truly surreal, melodic title. It gave you control of a microscopic, aquatic organism that plunged deeper and deeper into the depths in search of food to fuel its own evolution. This food came from other organisms of varying types, all occupying the many ~layers~ of the watery realm that pulsed with light and color. You controlled your organism by tilting the Sixaxis in any direction to move it, while any button on the controller would activate your creature's ~special move,~ which was dependant on what type of creature you chose (you unlocked one after each successful plunge).    A new creature appears. flOw only took about an hour and a half to beat completely, and that's assuming you collected/ate all the other organisms and fully evolved your creature - you could technically just rush to the depths and be done with it. With such a short play time, it seems reasonable that flOw might receive some sort of expansion to prolong the gameplay experience. It does so, but considering the fact that it only adds one new creature to the mix, that gameplay extension is rather minute. We're talking about 20 extra minutes of gameplay, which isn't a lot.   The Expansion Pack is developed by SuperVillain Studios, and we have to say that they've done a fantastic job keeping completely in line with the artistic style of the game. If you've never played flOw before, you'll need to ~beat~ it with all five creatures first before you have access to the new one.  Once you have access to it, you can use it at any time just like the others. We were actually quite fond of the new creature right from the start, considering its design and gameplay style. Because it doesn't have a name, we affectionately dubbed it ~The Little Death Machine.~ All kidding aside, this peculiar naming choice stems from its look, which is (thematically) quasi-metallic and bladed. A small mouth sits at the center of circular, segmented blades the rotate as you move. This little thing's special move is to condense into a circle and then spring out and whirl its cutting tendrils with surprising efficiency.   Going through the game with this creature is a lot of fun, because there are several new organisms to consume, including some quite impressive ones as you dive deeper in the levels. This creature also controls extremely well and moves at breakneck speeds - comparatively, at least, to its counterparts. Ultimately, this furious critter is a great addition to the group and we had a good time with it.   Still beautiful. Little Death Machine isn't the only change that the Expansion Pack brings. We were actually playing with an imported DualShock 3 and vibration support worked just fine. When the controllers make it stateside, we can only imagine that you'll be able to use them with flOw. Perhaps more notable is the addition of four-player cooperative mode, which assigns each player a different color and lets each player choose a different type of creature to play as.   And lastly, a new ~enemy~ organism was added that definitely surprised us. Resembling a small golden butterfly, consuming this little one will temporarily freeze the screen while you play. We at first thought this was a glitch until we realized that this ~freeze~ was actually a screen capture - eating those butterflies activates flOw's picture mode, which is the final new feature that the Expansion Pack introduces. In fact, all the new images marked from today were taken directly on our PS3 and just moved onto the computer. Although the temporary screen lockup is a little distracting, it certainly doesn't hurt the experience, and being able to see high quality images of your creatures is pretty neat.This Expansion Pack costs $2.99. In all honesty, if these new features sound worth your $3, than by all means snag the expansion and have fun - SuperVillain didn't tamper with any of the positive elements of the original and the additions, while sparse, are generally enjoyable. However, as a pack, this expansion is really simple and could have added a little more to flOw's mesmerizing beauty. Only spend the money if you're a fan of flOw and want to add a little more content to a melodic title.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
