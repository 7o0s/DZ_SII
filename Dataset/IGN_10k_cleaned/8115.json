The racing phenomenon, with awesome origins in moonshine running, gets bigger every year as audiences tune in for high-speed thrills and some pretty over-the-top personalities. The only downside of NASCAR -- except for the whole fossil fuels thing -- is the time commitment. It takes well over three hours to watch a full NASCAR race, but EA Mobile and developer Floodgate Entertainment have distilled the essentials into an easily digest five-minute experience.   NASCAR 07 is another dual-edition game. Higher-end handsets can play a 3D racer while mid- to low-range phones get the smoothest top-down driving game I've seen since I-play's Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift. This review is for the 2D edition, as I feel there is a significant enough difference between the versions that demands two scores.   EA Mobile makes extensive use of the NASCAR license. All of the drivers are recognizable names, such as Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon. Each car sprite is a faithful recreation of the real deal, all the way down to the paint job. NASCAR 07alsoemploys the biggest tracks in the circuit, like Daytona International and the Talledega Superspeedway. NASCAR fans are bound to be pleased with the use of the license.   When you begin, you can either jump right into a quick race, burning a few laps to get the hang of the controls, or head into The Chase, where you pick a racer and steer for the Cup Championship, amassing points with each victory. I highly recommend you try out an inconsequential quick race just to see how things work, such as drafting and pitting.   The field of vision takes up the majority of the screen, but meters, a track map, and race information flank your view of the field. The track map shows exactly where you are in the race every second of the way. The race ticker shows your standing, calls out actions of other drivers, and other necessary alerts. To the right, you have you fuel meter and a diagram of your four tires. Keep a watchful eye on these two callouts as they'll let you know when you need to pit. Ignoring them will only lead to disaster, especially if you do something so embarrassing as run out of fuel on the last lap.   One of my favorite things about NASCAR 07 is the ability to select your driver's aggressiveness on the track by pressing up or down. Instead of worrying about acceleration or braking, you instruct your driver to either drive as hard as possible or take it easy. Aggressive racing may help you advance in the field, but your car pays the price. Tearing around corners is hell on tires. The aggressiveness selector and manual pit control add real strategy to NASCAR 07. It's too easy to discount NASCAR as a bunch of left turns; these drivers have to make constant choices for over three hours -- and do it at 200mph.   Steering is handled by pushing left and right on the directional pad. Tap for the shallow turns to keep a smooth race line (the game lets you know when you've hit the turn just right). Turning too hard cause your back wheels to swing wide, inviting serious disaster in a crowded field.    To advance up the field, you must use drafting. When you successfully fall in behind another car and draft, little ~whoosh~ lines appear alongside your car. After drafting for a second or two, steer into an open lane to rocket ahead of the car in front of you. This is an overly simplified way to advance, but it makes the race quite accessible.   When it's finally time to pit, press *. At the next opportunity, your car will automatically pull into the pits. You can choose from a handful of maintenance options, such as ~fuel only~ or ~two tires.~ Gauge how long you'll be in the pits so you aren't too heavily punished. It's best to pit when the race in under a yellow flag.   This 2D NASCAR 07 is an extremely clean game. I tested it on both an LG 8300 and an LG Fusic. The game is very, very silky. Of course, the race field is only 20 cars (40 is just too many for the smallest screen),so things never get gummed up. The sprites, as mentioned, are dead-on, even if they are a little small. The meters, map, and text are easy to read.  NASCAR 07 2D is an excellent racing game for the NASCAR enthusiast. It captures the real strategy required of a driver on the track, from knowing when to go balls out and when to ease off to the use of drafting to effectively slingshot up a position. The game is complete with solid use of the license (racer and track selection) and options for just hopping in and running an eight-lap race to taking on the quest for the Championship Cup. If you like NASCAR, there is no reason you'll be disappointed with this accomplished mobile sim.", "date": "Feb 24, 2007"}
