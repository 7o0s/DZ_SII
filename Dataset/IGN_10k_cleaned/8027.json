Games like Wing Commander, TIE Fighter, Freespace, Independence War, and others still have thriving communities despite their age. When Matrix Games sent us a copy of StarShatter: The Gathering Storm, we were understandably excited to give it a try.  The new game offers players the chance to fly as a fighter pilot through a variety of dynamic campaigns. As you progress through the campaigns, you'll rise in rank and be given more and more responsibility and control over the forces involved. Once you've risen high enough, you'll step out of the cockpit and onto the bridge as you're given command of a number of powerful capital ships, from dreadnaughts to carriers.   The campaign offers some significant opportunities for the player to affect the outcome of the war. A stunning success in one mission will likely make for easier going in later missions. Likewise, a spectacular failure will mean players will have to fight an uphill battle to regain their advantage. Taking out a minefield or heavily damaging an enemy capital ship has a real, lasting consequence here. In fact, some of the bigger ships may require multiple missions before you can actually eliminate them. On the other hand, if you lose wing after wing of fighters in fruitless carrier assaults, you're going to find that your enemy can take advantage of your weakness. Having this level of flexibility makes the campaigns more interesting than the scripted pass/fail outcomes of missions in other space games.  There are some occasional news reports that pop up between missions to give you a sense of the overall progress of the war but we'd much rather see this commentary show a little more of a human scale instead of just talking about fleet movements and the overall outcome of battles. Getting letters from old friends is a nice touch, but the missions would be much more engaging if there were some prominent, persistent characters. Even something like Wing Commander's kill board would add a sorely needed touch of personality here. The fact that your own pilot is able to continue in the campaign even after being exploded seems to undercut the concept of a progressive career.  At the start of each campaign, you'll be shown a map of the galaxy and its individual sectors and be given a number of missions you can undertake. These can take the form of simple patrols or escort missions, strikes against ground targets on nearby planets, assaults against enemy capital ships, or the defense of your own fleet against attack. After the completion of each mission, you'll be shown a number of new missions that build on your previous successes or failures. The campaigns we've played seem to culminate in the destruction of either your own or your enemy's carrier forces.   Unfortunately, the overall objective of the campaign and the objectives of the individual missions aren't as clear as they could be. There have been many times where we were unsure of what to do next. While it's true that each mission comes with specific objectives, they're not always updated as you complete each task. A nice voice over telling you when you've completed an objective and when to return to the ship would be nice. As it is, you have to wait until you see other wings start to fly back to the carrier before you can order your own men to land.  By default, StarShatter uses the hardcore Newtonian physics that treats acceleration and velocity as realistically as possible. This allows for all sorts of inventive tactics, from sliding past a capital ship while keeping your weapons trained on it at all times, to accelerating quickly away from a pursuer and then turning 180 degrees to fire at them as you continue to fly away from them. There seem to be some weird and inconsistent fuel consumption issues that tend to undercut the realism of the model but it's nice for players who want the ~authentic~ space experience.      If you're not into the less forgiving Newtonian model, you can opt for a high-drag version of it that functions basically the same way but decelerates you over time when you're not thrusting. This is a nice option for players who find themselves constantly overshooting their targets under the full Newtonian system. A third ~arcade~ flight model is included as well for players who prefer a more traditional Wing Commander style flight system.  In all cases, StarShatter has a severely evil collision model. Bump up against an enemy and it's likely that you'll both disintegrate in a cloud of fire. It's a nice nod to realism but you can sometimes find yourself losing a mission simply because you got too close to another ship. You'll also need to consider that the explosion of enemy ships does damage to nearby ships. If you find yourself right behind an enemy, you might want to back off before finishing them off or else your ship will be disabled by their explosion.   As good as the physics system is, there are some aggravating touches. For one thing, it's too unforgiving for the AI pilots when it comes to landing. We've had friendly AI pilots crash because, presumably, their speed was too high or they were out of line in their approach to the hangar. Less troublesome but no less ridiculous is the lack of stalls in the atmosphere. We've pulled in for landings on airstrips and been basically hanging in air before touchdown. We couldn't help but imagine the Wright Flyer passing us by on approach. Given the realism built into the rest of the physics system, it seems odd that enemy rockets and missiles don't transfer their own motion to the targets they hit.  Fighting against enemy fighters and capital ships is probably the most enjoyable aspect of the game. Starting with the basic approach, you'll unload with missiles before closing to cannon and laser range. A wide variety of missile loadouts let you tailor your arsenal to the mission in front of you -- torpedoes for capital ship assaults, rockets for minefield clearing, SRMs for dogfights. You'll also be responsible for directing the activities of your wingmen here. Unfortunately, they seem a little timid on the attack, giving your enemy the chance to strike back before being eliminated.  The fleet battles are a bit more difficult to manage. In the absence of clearly defined firing arcs, you may find yourself flailing around a bit hoping to get a lock onto a target. A simple system showing where your batteries are would really help you to fight a little more intelligently. While the carriers are the most fun to command, it's a real shame that you have to leave the main game screen and go to a rather boring spreadsheet to plan and launch your fighter and bomber wings. (The same is true for issuing orders to the other large ships in your fleet, but this is handled much more quickly.) Everything else for the capital ships takes place right in the main game view, so you won't have to leave the action in order to plan your strikes. While the mouse control for the fighters is relatively good, the mouse controls for the fleets are almost useless because they'll arbitrarily assign a pitch order to your ship. It's much more effective to use the arrow keys on the keyboard.   Throughout our experience, we found a number of small bugs that frustrated our efforts to enjoy the game. In some cases, the range to enemy spaceships would jump wildly, alternating between 25k and 6k, for example. This is a huge problem when playing with Newtonian physics and trying to estimate how to burn your engines so you don't overshoot the target. Other missions seemed to ask too much of your fighter as you'd run out of fuel long before you've reached your final waypoint. In keeping with the lack of feedback on objectives, we found that our ships would immediately begin spinning wildly if the autopilot was engaged past the final waypoint. There are plenty of other inconsistencies, most of which are more annoying than hurtful.      StarShatter offers some pleasant visuals. Most impressive are the planets. These truly look like real planets and have the right sense of scale. Anyone who's played the recent Star Trek: Legacy will definitely understand how important it is to have planets that actually look like they're the size of planets. Realists will appreciate the simple star fields that serve as the backdrop for the action, but it's just not as impressive or effective as the more fanciful gas clouds, comets and whatnot that color other games. It can make it a little tougher to maintain your orientation in the absence of these colorful nebulae but it definitely makes the game feel more realistic.  When you move down into the atmosphere of a planet, however, you expect to see a few more details that bring the world to life. Unfortunately, apart from a cloud layer and some small enemy installations, there's really nothing of interest on the planets. Naturally, we're not expecting full cities and riverboat casinos here but the complete absence of any other features really makes the planetary missions seem a bit plain.   If the capital ship designs aren't necessarily inspired, they're at least plausible. The simple box and tube shapes won't win you over in terms of their aesthetic, but they manage to convey a practical sort of solidity that's reinforced by the texture work. Subtle lighting effects give the ships a great sense of depth. The small craft, unfortunately, leave a lot more to be desired. They all look depressingly plain and utilitarian to evoke any real sense of the excitement and drama of space combat. Next to X-Wings, Vipers and Rapiers, these ships look like space taxis.  Combat effects aren't particularly impressive. Laser and cannon fire seems flat and lifeless and missile trails, though twisting pleasantly through space, are a bit angular. The explosions and fires seem like canned effects that are simply laid over the ship models. Some of the larger ships explode into satisfying chunks but otherwise, the ship models simply disappear is a burst of orange when they're destroyed.  Finally, the sound in StarShatter is relatively good. There's a lot of voice work in this game and it really adds to the experience. It can get a little out of hand when lots of voice cues are piling up. Even in the tutorial the pace of the voice commands seems out of sync with the action, sometimes running too fast, other times running too slow.   Space sims are too few and far between to pass up even the mediocre ones. That's sort of the position we're in with StarShatter. Lacking the cinematic touches and human dimensions of other space sims, StarShatter feels a bit flat at times. Once you commit to the experience, you're rewarded with a remarkably flexible campaign that feels like it reflects your successes, albeit in a rather detached way. If you're a hardcore space combat fan, you definitely owe it to yourself to try the demo before deciding whether it's worth the effort to get TIE Fighter up and running. If you're lukewarm on the genre as a whole, StarShatter won't win you over.", "date": "Feb 9, 2007"}
