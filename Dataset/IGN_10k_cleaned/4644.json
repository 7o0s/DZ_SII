Games such as Einhander (Square) and RayStorm (Working Designs) have shown that there's still plenty of life in the genre, and the latest from Taito aims to only reaffirm that fact.  Originally designed and released for the arcade in Japan, G. Darius marks the first fully-polygonal outing for the classic shooter series. Like its predecessors, the story revolves around a race of mechanical fish-like bad guys from another galaxy who're bent on destroying you home system. It's your job as the ace pilot to send their scaly rear ends fleeing.  As with the series' earlier installments, gameplay is viewed from the side and moves left to right apart from the occasional vertical scrolling of the screen for effect. What's different this time around is that, thanks to the game's fully-polygon nature, camera panning and other effects are utilized to enhance its cinematic impact a la Einhander.  Apart from fancy camera tricks, it's quite similar to the older Darius games. Massive amounts of enemies swarm the screen, gigantic bosses mark the end of ever level, and there's a two-player option. This time, however, you have a limited ability to latch onto and control certain enemies as super weapons.  You've got also 14 stages to contend with, but you won't see them all your first time through. Just like the other Darius games, this one presents you with a two possible paths after completing a stage, and each one takes you into a different area of the solar system.Shooters have always been my personal favorites, so I'm always happy to see a new entry in the genre come along. It's even better when the shooter's good, as is the case with G. Darius.Despite the fancy polygonal graphics (which are superb), it's not that much different from the past Darius games. But that doesn't hurt it in the least. They've always been solid and entertaining games, and more of that, plus next-level graphics and sound can't be bad. Just don't expect a reinvention of the shooter, er, wheel.As for intense, seat-of-your-pants gameplay, G. Darius delivers it in spades. But it does have a problem, and one that's plagued the genre for gages: slowdown. Thankfully it occurs only when a tremendous amount of enemies appear on-screen.In the end: it's a big game, it's lots of fun, and it's a blast with two players. If you're a shooter fan, you'll want this in your collection. One very sore thumbs up.", "date": "Sep 18, 1998"}
