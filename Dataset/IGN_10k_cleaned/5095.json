Now that SNK has reformed, the new and interesting things it's doing aren't exactly all that new or interesting. But at least there are some new games in circulation. To wit, SVC Chaos: SNK Vs. Capcom is the company's newest 2D fighter on Xbox pitting classic SNK characters against the most popular lineup from Capcom's huge library of characters.SVC Chaos: SNK Vs. Capcom is a solid, if uninspired substance-over-style fighter that gives the legions fans of both SNK and Capcom something to play. It's not going to rock, change, or even inspire the world of 2D fighting, but it does provide some pure skill-based fighting for the fighter-lean Xbox. GameplayPublished by SNK and developed by Playmore, this humble 2D fighter combines a solid cast of characters including a few unique individuals to the arena, adds online play to the mix and ratchets up the AI to a healthy competitive level right quick. The initial playable roster includes 24 characters in all (12 SNK and 12 Capcom characters), featuring lots of standards. You'll see Capcom's Ryu, Ken, Chun-li, Guile, Akuma, Sagat, and Dhalsim and others. The less obvious ones such as Tessa and Hugo (who looks like a combination of Andre the Giant and Howard Stern) are fun to experiment with. On the SNK side, you'll see almost all regulars: Kyo, Mr. Karate, Ryo, Terry, and Kasumi among others make their returns. The only one who even sort of sticks out is Shiki.  Super freak on your opponent like this. After playing a rather horrid preview build that had us worried for some time, the final review build stands up relatively well with a mostly solid framerate (it generally hangs around 30 FPS), decent controls (depending on your view of the Xbox s-controller as a fighting controller), and a decent set of moves, counters, cancels and combos. The game offers Arcade mode, Vs., Practice, Survival, and Xbox Live online play. Plus, as you progress you'll open up characters and art in Gallery, you can color and moderately stylize your character in the Colored It mode, or see your fight in Replay. When there are no friends around, Arcade is always where it's at. Here, you fight with unlimited continues until you beat the final boss. There are about 10 fights in all, plus a few sub-bosses and a final boss. The game's AI is quite easy through the first three or so fights and at the boss levels, it raises significantly. It's not hard, but if you've played any SNK or Capcom games, you'll remember that the bosses are more cheap that tough. SNK doesn't lose that cheap boss touch here. Mind you, I'm not complaining. I love a good fight, but be prepared. The final boss is easily cheaper and more cranked up in aggressiveness than most Capcom fighters I remember playing. In this regard, SNK has added a few nice touches to get you by. After a defeat (there are eight levels of difficulty, and levels seven and eight are insane), you are given a choice of handicaps. You'll be offered the chance to upgrade your power gauge recovery, lower your enemy's health by 1/3, or lower his or her AI by one notch, or of course, you can choose to do none of these. The first time through this is quite helpful. Another nice touch is that, in Arcade mode, if you die, you can switch to any other character and continue where you left off.The loading is fast. The intro text screens for any set of characters is  strangely so fast, you'll have to speed read to catch everything that's said between the two. It's not like they have much to say, but the witty banter is quite funny sometimes, and it's always nice to hear a good slam.     The fighting itself is a little mixed. First, the Xbox Dpad is by no means the equivalent to an arcade stick or even a Dreamcast or Saturn Dpad -- far from it. The round hard buttons themselves are a little annoying -- the location of the black and white buttons doesn't make up for, say, the double shoulder pads on the PS2, and the trigger buttons are even a little wonky too. Once I adjusted to all of these, I found the responsiveness to be better than so-so, but not great, and certainly not perfect. I often found myself taunting instead of hurling fireballs, which really messed things up. Again, after spending more time with the controls, like with any game, I adjusted to them, but with this one, I'd say I took more time to adjust and perfect moves than with other controllers and games. I'll say this, the controls are just less than solid and could have used more fine-tuning. As for the fighting techniques, SNK's game has a few features, but overall, it's pretty bare-bones. You can build up your character's power bar up to three levels by performing super and/or combos moves. You can pull off a number of individual special attacks, which are instantly checkable in the menu system, or the Exceed move, which by default on the menu, can only be used once. (You can adjust this in the Options screen too.) Interestingly, once you're able to activate it, you'll have to whip off that Exceed quick because it decreases within seconds. There's also a guard crush bar. The game offers custom combos, Max mode combos, juggles (some characters are much better at this than others), and Super Cancel and Special Cancel moves. There is no doubt a hefty amount of depth here. But it's not necessarily new depth, it's depth from characters you've seen and played for years prior. The great thing is that you will be able to play them on your Xbox and, if you choose, on Xbox Live. The online portion is, naturally, as stripped down as the rest of the game. It's not terrible, just minimal. You can choose from QuickMatch, OptiMatch, and CreateMatch, hang out in the lobby or check statistics (your weekly, monthly or overall stats, or your friends' stats). While playing offline in Arcade or Vs, and signed in, your friends list will let you know when others are ready to play. Overall, the experience was better than average, with a quick load time, little lag time, and relatively un-obscured fighting goodness. The matches are organized with little sophistication, though. You have little optimization options, and there is no rematch option, so after a fight you'll instantly get booted back to the general menu. Again, it's a functioning online system, it's just neither sophisticated nor advanced. Still, it's damn fun to fight 2D games online.  Yes, I really am trying to blow smoke up your ass. GraphicsViusally, SNK's game, on the whole, is decent at best. It's not going to win any awards. The simplistic menu is without enhancements. The  clich intro scene is forgettable and its simplicity is compounded by several uninspired backgrounds (some look better than others, but in general, they're not great), primitive lighting techniques (that light up characters only to create an akward outline), and less than imaginative music. Depending on your adherence to purity, the Capcom characters look distinctly different than they would in a pure Capcom game. Every one of them is slightly more realistic, taller, and bulkier. Guile's hair, for instance, is whacked. It's so huge!The animations, however, aren't bad. They're slightly more realistic than in other games. They're also not held up by anything technical; they're relatively quick, good looking and uninterrupted. Some levels are more refined and pretty (Church, Hell) than others (Power Generation, Secret Shrine). They're all kind of a mix. For instance, Secret Shrine has neat looking water, but the sky is choppy. And in Power Generation, the art itself is cool, but the background animation is awful. SoundMusically, this is a return to the 16-bit days. There are some cool, fast-tempo beats that you'll be humming without knowing it, and there are some songs you'll really wish you could forget, but won't be able to. The sound effects are in line with this style of game, filled with yells, screams and hollers of adrenaline-filled attacks. You know, with Vega sounding as high-pitched and silly as ever, and the heavier guys, Hugo, Earthquake making giant loud hollers and grunts.In all, SVC Chaos: SNK Vs. Capcom is a decent fighter with a stripped down fighting system that some may prefer over fancier, more combo-studded variations. Stripped down pretty much describes this game well in most respects. The lineups are relatively predicable, with SNK's Shiki and Capcom's Tessa and Hugo standing out from the crowd. The graphics and sound aren't terrible, but then again, they're also very old school, in both their design and in their technical approach. The online functions are probably the aspect that will really grab your interest and keep you playing well after you've beaten the game a zwillion times, and though there isn't much to the interface, and you'll get sick of constantly being returned to the main menu, it's about time there were 2D fighters online. While it's obvious this game was more or less slapped together, and the online is as crude as it gets, at least the fighting in SNK Vs. Capcom holds up relatively well.", "date": "Oct 9, 2004"}
