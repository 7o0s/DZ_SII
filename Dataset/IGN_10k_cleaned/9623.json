As a member of Capital City's elite police unit, the Pursuit Force, you've got the green light to do whatever you like, dishing out the death sentence without so much as a verbal warning, let alone a trial. Spot a guy who has a red circle around them? Shoot them. And if you pass a car with a big arrow above it, blow it up. Yep, in this futuristic alternate reality, zero tolerance means just that, and that can only make for a riotous action game, right?    Well, as with Sony's previous Pursuit Force title, Extreme Justice's core crazy stunt driving is where the game excels. Throughout its numerous missions, you're given free rein to speed and weave down freeways like you're auditioning for Police! Camera! Action! Plus, you can pull up alongside other moving cars and hurl yourself on top. Then, why not plug the driver with a couple of well-aimed slugs and climb behind the wheel yourself? The fun doesn't end there either - if you've accumulated enough juice in your Justice meter (filled by polishing off bad guys), it's possible to execute a bullet-time leap and pick off a few more enemies, all while you're zipping along the tarmac. It's a lot of fun and you won't easily tire of such extravagant stunts, especially with so many new ideas and objectives constantly thrown in your path. Over the game's 50-plus missions, you're tasked with everything from chucking opponents off the roof of your truck by swaying from side to side, to gunning down an overhead helicopter while weaving through oncoming traffic.    Enemies are auto-targeted for you. Just pick your biggest gun and shoot.  Extreme Justice definitely trumps your average get-from-A-to-B-against-the-clock driving game when it comes to variety. In terms of explosive spectacle and over-the-top arcade action, it's hard to beat - particularly when it comes to the newly-introduced major boss vehicle set-pieces. There aren't many PSP games that cram in boss fights atop a plane cruising at 5,000-feet. These battles pit you against one gang leaders per level, all with a unique vehicular twist. One epic boss encounter sees you perched on top of a speeding fire truck, dodging fire balls, inching along the side, shooting armed cronies and frantically trying to regain balance if they land a shot. Admittedly, it overindulges in the QTE action a bit but, luckily, Extreme Justice's frequent forays into real-time button pushing sequences work well as a means of introducing some up-close drama.   It's not all about gameplay additions though. For this follow-up, developer BigBig has gone some way to addressing a major criticism levelled at its original Pursuit Force. Last outing, the game suffered from some seriously frustrating difficulty spikes. This time around, it's definitely more balanced but sadly still not perfect. For instance, there's still too much focus on tough time limits. All too often, goals are so harsh progress screeches to a lengthy halt while you grit your teeth in increasing fury. Clearly the large number of missions on offer is great in terms of value, but giving the option to move off a difficult mission when defeat is practically inevitable would have helped make things infinitely more manageable.   You'll find yourself chased down on bikes, fire engines and helicopters.   Unfortunately, Extreme Justice is equally uneven from an entertainment perspective. While driving all manner of vehicles - from boats to trucks to hovercraft - is largely enjoyable, especially in missions where you're leap-frogging from one to another every few seconds, on-foot missions simply don't match up in terms of quality. For instance, enemies come rushing at you with all the intelligence and panache of a Friday night drunk clutching a broken bottle, but still don't seem to struggle caning three-quarters of your health before you've even had chance to think about taking cover. On-foot missions can be utterly draining in their ineptitude, offering little in the way of fun or skill fulfilment.    Alongside the one-off missions found in Challenge mode, four multiplayer modes round off the experience and include both versus and co-op cops and robbers style car chase games. You can either spend fraught minutes trying to blow each other up, or take to a super-vehicle with one driving and one manning a kick-ass rear mounted gun. The Rampage game is the only let down of the lot and that's just because it's an on-foot deathmatch that really doesn't offer the same thrills as the four-wheeled bouts.Extreme Justice is a game that often delivers and sometimes doesn't. It's been improved no end since the first instalment but, just as you're enjoying the pure arcade outrageousness and speed of a chase mission, you're brought down to earth by a subsequent trial-and-error shoot-out. It's very nearly a great game and its on-the-rails arcade driving and shooting is hard to dislike. But there are still things that need fixing and improving if BigBig's wannabe blockbuster plans to be a true Force to be reckoned with.", "date": "Nov 23, 2007"}
