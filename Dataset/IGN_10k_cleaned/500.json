Apart from the occasional odd hit title (like Alien Trilogy), all Acclaim titles are pretty much exactly the same. They're all 2D, sprite-based platform/action games, with little to recommend them other than whichever new licensed character they've using this time.   Iron Man/X-O Manowar In Heavy Metal is no exception. Besides having one of the most unnecessarily long game titles ever, IMXOMIHM (you don't really expect me to keep writing the whole title, do you?) is indicative of the Acclaim assembly-line game process (~Code by Acclaim, programmed by so-and-so~). Which is good, because you know exactly what to expect. It's also bad because, well, you know exactly what to expect.   Choose either Iron Man or X-O Manowar, two comic book characters (who are now dead, by the way) who are, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable. Each is equipped with a mean punch and kick, blasters, and a big ole special weapon, the Uni-Beam, that shoots a phat beam and looks impressive. Their flight capabilities are extremely limited, which is frustrating considering that the comic book characters could fly around the world if they wanted to. But then you'd be able to fly out of the game, and we can't have that.   So you walk (running is a double-tap pain in the ass) left or right, shoot dumb spider aliens, and occasionally fight bosses. It's incredibly mind-numbing, but not in a fun, Valium-kind of way. It's just boring. The control is as sluggish as it gets, and the graphics, while decent enough for a 2D side-scroller, just aren't up to 32-bit standards.   In short, Iron Man/X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal (whew!) is no fun, no matter how long it takes you to say the name.", "date": "Jan 15, 1997"}
