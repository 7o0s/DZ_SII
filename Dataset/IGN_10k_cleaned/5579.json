Making such a significant change to the PC classic was a bold move but resulted in a number of flaws. Worms: Forts Under Siege adds some new strategic elements to the formula but doesn't address the problems that the first three-dimensional game suffered from.    At its core this version of Worms is still a turn-based strategy game in which groups of green warriors launch comical weapons at each other in an attempt to control a land mass. In Forts Under Siege there are also fortifications that add to the worm's firepower, health, and supplies. While a worm can place a building and attack on the same turn there is a 60-second time limit that forces the game to be more action-oriented than strategic.    The building elements of Forts Under Siege are seamlessly tied to the gameplay from Worms 3D. Each team starts the match with a stronghold: a large central building that acts as a supply center for all other structures. Unlike other real-time strategy games that are based on resource management, Worms treats buildings the same as the weapons that parachute onto the map in wooden crates. A worm simply selects the building from the item menu and places it within the available squares marked on the map.    Building spaces are only available next to other structures owned by the player, and walls are automatically constructed between each tower. The walls not only allow worms to travel on top of their small city, they also act as a crucial supply chain. Destroying a wall completely will also level all of the buildings that have been cut off from the stronghold. This means that successful towns will almost always evolve into compact formations.   There are eight types of buildings, each with their own advantages on the battlefield. There are also spaces labeled ~victory locations~ which are marked by floating yellow stars. Extending the fort to cover a victory location gives players access to a higher level of building. The most basic addition to the fort is called a tower. This is a weak offensive building that supplies worms with larger weapons like the Mortar, Cluster Launcher, Old Lady, and the Napalm Strike. These weapons can only be used from the top of the tower, meaning that fort placement affects offense as well as defense.   In order to win the round players can either obliterate all members of the other team or destroy their stronghold, which has hit points just like a normal character. There is also a high-level building called a Wonder which automatically wins the round if it remains standing for three consecutive turns. This is a nifty idea, but it encourages conservative gameplay that works against the supposedly more action-oriented take on Worms.      These new strategic elements are interesting and easy to get the hang of. Unfortunately, the basic combat has a number of control issues that harm every aspect of the game. First, the worms can be difficult to maneuver through the landscape. Basic movement is sluggish and while the jumping sends the worms farther through the air than in Worms 3D, it is still difficult to control. Another issue is a floaty camera that always seems to hover too close to the characters. There is an alternate overhead view, but it can only be used for viewing the map and not for movement.     Targeting weapons is also a hassle. First off, the aiming reticule is far too loose. Precise shots require a very soft touch on the analogue stick and a lot of patience. It is just as difficult to predict the trajectory of projectile weapons. Fans of the 2D series will remember the ease of guessing where a weapon would detonate. The jump to 3D has made aiming more complicated. While in first-person view there is a strength meter on the bottom of the screen. Filling up the meter puts more distance on the projectile, but there is no good way to gauge how far the item will be fired. Watching four consecutive grenade throws sail past an opponent and land in the ocean can be extremely frustrating.   Taking down an enemy's fort can be a rewarding process, however it doesn't completely make up for the lack of destructible environments which have long been a stable of Worms combat. In Worms 3D blowing up land masses helped to detract from the aiming issues. If a player couldn't hit a target dead on, they could at least aim low and hope to send their enemy into the icy deep.      Worms: Forts Under Siege features a quick play mode, a deep tutorial that covers all aspects of fort building, and a campaign mode that spans four distinct time periods. There is also a trial mode which throws the worms into some unique battle scenarios.   The multiplayer section of the game is completely customizable, with enough options to make your head spin. Everything from weapon frequency to the hats your worms wear can be adjusted. There is also a ~fortpot~ feature that appeared in Worms 3D as the ~wormpot~. This automatically mixes up the level options for a quick multiplayer game with unpredictable variables.    Overall, the presentation of this game has been improved from Worms 3D. The game's menus have been simplified and the graphics are noticeably better. The characters and environments are still simple but they suit the goofy cartoon theme of the game. Worms: Forts Under Siege does not feature online play on any console which is a disappointment considering the online features included with Worms 3D.     I can't help but wonder how fun this game could have been if it stuck with the tried-and-true two-dimensional version of Worms combat and visually went the route Viewtiful Joe. The game could have added exaggerated animations and a blending of three-dimensional elements without diverging from the classic aiming and movement systems that made the series so addictive in the first place.    Closing Comments  Worms: Forts Under Siege still has the light-hearted sense of humor that the series is known for. The weapons are comical contraptions and the character animation can be very cute. Unfortunately the frustrating controls tend to drain the fun from the game, and fans of the two-dimensional version will seriously dislike the changes that have been made to Worms. There is fun to be had in this game but it is buried under a heap of problems.", "date": "Mar 15, 2005"}
