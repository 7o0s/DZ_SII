Games that claim innovation usually leave the player asking ~What was so special about this one?  It was just like that one.~  This is even truer in the massively multiplayer genre than any other.  Most take one piece from game x and one from game y and add in their own unique twist z, but after playing it for some time, it starts to feel just like every other on the market.  3 Rings Software, however, not only breaks the mold, but smashes it to pieces.  Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates takes puzzle games and puts them smack dab in the middle of a persistent state world with a player driven economy.  Not only that, but you get to be a pirate, complete with cleaver and hat (if you so choose).  How could you not love that?       The meat of this game is the puzzles.  Some have a distinctly Tetris feel to them and others remind one of that family favorite, Othello.  Each puzzle has rankings and levels associated with it, although both are very abstract - using words like Ultimate and Weighty to give a general idea of your adeptness.  The top ten players in each puzzle are viewable though, so you can see and strive to be #1.  As you play a game, your experience level increases constantly, whereas the ranking level changes dynamically over time, similar to how chess rankings work.     One of the more interesting features of Puzzle Pirates is its fully player-driven economy.  Player labor is responsible for all items in the game, from ships to swords.  Governors of islands issue deeds to players to have shops built, which are then constructed, again, by player labor.  Unfortunately right now only one of the shops - the distillery - has a labor puzzle associated with it.  The distilling puzzle is quite fun, but in order to play the puzzle, you must find a distillery that is hiring.  The player owners of the shops decide whether they want to hire or not and set wages.  Players who take jobs in shops will affect the speed with which goods are produced.  Some things, like wood and iron, are foraged off deserted islands and sold to the player shops (or they can be bought from markets).  The player shops then turn those things into something usable and sell them to players or other shops.  While the distillery puzzle allows players to take a more active role in the process, as of right now most are passive - they are created when enough time passes.  Puzzles for the other shops are in the works but it may be some time before we see new ones added.    The majority of time will be spent on a ship, be it as part of a crew or just jobbing.  Jobbing is taking a position with a crew temporarily to earn a little money (pieces of eight aka PoE).  Each crew is very different from the next, so as a new player it is a good idea to get to know several crews before choosing one to join.  Almost every player will join a crew, because ships are very expensive and starting your own crew is pretty time consuming.  Captains are typically the people with the most time on their hands, although I'm sure a few have broken the mold.  However, even for achievers with not as much time on their hands as others, there is plenty to achieve in this game.  You can collect PoE  and try to win an island auction or try to get the most expensive outfits or swords.  Most time spent on ships is spent doing the grinding tasks - Sailing and Carpentry.  These tasks in Puzzle Pirates take the form of puzzles, of course.  For example, the carpentry puzzle is a fill in the pieces game.  Using fewer pieces to fill in the holes along with not overlapping will result in a greater rating.  Two of the puzzles, Navigating and Gunnery, require players to be a ranked member of a crew, although there is the ability for the Officers to assign jobbing pirates to these tasks.  Each puzzle is unique and interesting and addictive in the same nature that Tetris and Bejeweled are.    Probably the best part of the game is Sea Battle.  As the ships sail across the Great Ocean, they'll encounter a variety of ships, from brigands to the Navy.  All ships can be attacked, and there are three steps to each attack.  First, a ship has to be caught on the high seas - the engagement phase.  If you aren't fast enough, they may escape you.  Second is the Sea Battle phase, where the Officer in charge will navigate the ship through rocks and currents and try to intercept the other ship, but not before landing a few cannon blasts on it to weaken it.  Finally, the boarding takes place and the swordfight commences.  The swordfight reminds me strongly of player versus player Tetris, but it has its own twists.  Players will choose opponents to fight against and it is strategic to take out the strongest opponents and team up with other players to hit them harder.    There are two types of blocks that fall, regular blocks of a variety of colors and breakers.  The breakers will cause every color of that block to disappear.  Building up a tower of blocks before hitting them with a breaker will mean the opponent you are fighting will be hit by swords, which take 3 turns to turn into actual blocks.  Of course, they can hit you just as hard.  Different swords have different patterns for the sword attacks.  Foils are the starting sword and have a basic hitting pattern which doesn't hurt too badly.  More expensive swords have more complicated patterns and can easily wipe an opponent out if used smartly.  The teams go head to head in this part of the Sea Battle and the first team who has all their members knocked out loses.  The winners then pillage the other vessel, taking Pieces of Eight and whatever other goods they might be carrying, from rum to cannon balls.  If you are on the losing end, do not fear, they don't take everything.   Another interesting feature is the inclusion of tournaments.  Players can start a tournament in sword fighting or drinking.  Some tournaments have prizes in the tens of thousands of PoE - so a lot of players really do get involved.  Only the winner of the tournament is awarded the pot, though.  For tournaments that get really big, it would be nice to assign a 2nd and 3rd place award.  Other activities take place, such as a murder mystery.  There is plenty to do when you don't feel like pillaging.  The developers run their own activities as well, and award players prizes like a parrot to put on their shoulder or the ability to rename their vessels.   The game is Java based, which sets it apart from your standard monthly fee charging persistent state world.  Being Java based definitely limits what the guys at 3 Rings can do with the game and it is a 2D game by design.  The artwork is very basic, although they've gone to some measures to make a huge variety of clothing to be purchased - all of which looks very piratey.  I personally would have liked to have less weeble like looking avatars, but since there's no way to really get in close to your avatar and the top down isometric angle can't be changed, it really doesn't matter.  Customization of ships and shops would be nice as well, as there is no way to currently do that.   The music is appropriate and will instantly put you into the pillaging mood. There are sound effects in each puzzle, but sometimes these can be a tad annoying and you may find yourself turning them way down.  However, other sound effects are very useful, such as at the end of a battle when you've found yourself knocked out early - it can bring your attention back to the game.   There's more roleplaying in Yohoho! than in any other online world I've played.  Everyone talks the talk of a pirate and there is an in-game dictionary in the help files for anyone who wants to expand their vocabulary.  Little did I know that deadlights were eyes and a messdeck lawyer is a know-it-all.  When you first board a ship, many an Ahoy will await you.  Players fully thrust themselves into the role of a pirate, even threatening players with walking the plank or talking about sending opponents to Davy Jones Locker (the bottom of the sea for those less pirate-inclined).  It is very entertaining and you'll find yourself quickly swept into the world of the Buccaneer.    Puzzle Pirates is very stable and there are almost no bugs to be found.  Any time a bug is discovered, it is quickly fixed by the development team.  They are also very communicative, a big plus in any online project.  They have two levels of customer support, Greeters and Ocean Masters and you can always find someone online to help you, simply by doing a /who.  They quickly take care of anyone with a questionable name or abusive players, so the entire player base you'll find is generally friendly.  There is even a profanity filter.  Ahoy and Ye's abound in a very deep roleplaying environment.  The puzzles are very interesting and there is a form of leveling, albeit abstract.  A pretty deep player economy is built in as well.  The entire game is well put together, even if the graphics and sounds aren't of Galaxies caliber.  So, Avast Ye, we be sailin' the Great Ocean, come join us mate!", "date": "Jan 13, 2004"}
