Atlus has become well known as a company for the hardcore RPG fan, releasing their niche titles to an audience hungry for new games every few months.  These faithful rarely are disappointed with the result, as Atlus frequently packs in extra art books, soundtrack discs and other items to reward consumers who purchase their titles.  But even these large box sets can't make up for titles that aren't particularly striking, engaging or enjoyable.  Unfortunately, the recent release of Growlanser: Heritage of War is such a title, with a story that's convoluted and poorly developed, visuals that look ripped from the original PlayStation, and game mechanics that are crippled and weakly designed.   The story behind Heritage of War takes place on an island continent that's broken up into three separate kingdoms: Grangale, Neylern and Cyriltia.  For some reason, this continent has been mysteriously isolated from the sea and the rest of the world by a mysterious barrier as well as creatures known as Screapers.  With these powerful beasts swarming the shores, humanity has been forced inland to survive, which is difficult by itself.  Making things worse, the land itself is decaying and falling apart, causing the countries to fight over the last remaining fertile spaces.  That sounds pretty bleak, with humanity slowly going extinct by either war or extermination by monster, and would be were it not for the creation of an organization known as the PMB, or Peace Maintenance Brigade.  Using an ancient weapon discovered in a ruin that they call the Admonisher, the PMB ~brokers peace~ by unleashing its power upon a battlefield, forcing enemies to come to the diplomacy table.   You'll experience Heritage of War from multiple perspectives. Instead of playing as one specific character in Heritage of War, you experience the world through the eyes of multiple characters across five chapters, all of whom find themselves affected either by the Screaper threat or the PMB's influence over the world.  However, the initial problems with the game start with its extremely weak story development.  Many elements behind the game premise are rarely addressed, such as why the continent has fallen underneath this energy barrier preventing people from leaving, or whether the existence of the PMB does more damage to the rest of the continent by its coercion than it saves.  What's worse, you rarely find yourself caring about any of the characters thanks to hackneyed storytelling, bland character development and shallow exposition into their personalities.  As a result, when you wind up changing characters (which also forces you to start over in the eventual character leveling up process) you could honestly care less about any of the people you control.   Battles obviously plays a large role in building up your party's stats, and can occur in one of two different ways: you can fight monsters that happen to be in the same environment that you're in, or you can take on a mission and battle enemies there.  Players designate the enemy they want to attack by cycling through targets.  Each action triggered, whether its an attack, magical spell or ability (known as a knack) takes a specific amount of time to charge before it can be used again, and powerful strikes take longer than weaker ones.  Party members will frequently act upon their own, and while battles happen in real time, you can pause the action to issue commands to allies or designate specific actions for everyone in the party.   Good luck seeing what's going on here. Unfortunately, much of combat breaks down thanks to shoddy mechanics.  First of all, players will frequently find that their party's AI in combat can be incredibly asinine.  You will find yourself physically pushing friendly character models around a map as they get in your way of an opponent.  While this can be a tactic that you can use to bottleneck some areas on a battlefield, it's really asinine when you find yourself having to constantly reposition a magic user who decides to charge these choke points.  This is because many of the commands that you issue to a party member will be specific to a one targeted enemy, meaning that you can designate a magic user to hang back on one creature and they'll sometimes charge the next beast blindly.  Unfortunately, since there's no way of canceling or queuing up orders, issuing a new movement command to safety takes the same amount of time to charge and execute as a standard action, which frequently results in significant damage to this mindless character.       The other infuriating aspect to the combat systems is the fact that you will frequently stumble into the aforementioned missions without actually knowing it, because the nature of the game will sometimes decide attacks on a group of beasts is actually a specific story based objective that you need to complete to further the plot of your characters.  Initially, you may be given a job to do, such as killing all of the monsters on the stage, but you'll also find that many of the tasks will change in the middle of a battle, such as forcing everyone in your party to flee before you or preventing a certain character from dying.  Unfortunately, you won't be told any of this information up front; you'll actually need to track it down by pausing the entire game.  For some reason, this is kept completely separate from the command screen.  Instead, you need to access part of the overall menus for the game, which makes no sense in the middle of combat.   Once you do eventually defeat enemies in battle, you'll acquire experience and items known as ability plates, which you'll place in a grid to learn different abilities.  There are three separate kinds of abilities that can be acquired (magic, knacks or innate skills), and you can arrange these plates in any configuration that you wish.  There are three guidelines for the plate system, however.  You only have so much space to put plates down on the grid, and plates can only be accurately connected with each other based on the directional arrows on the edges of other plates.  What's more, you can only learn skills if you've connect these plates to your character's ~flow,~ or points that are placed into gaining new abilities.   The ability grid -- useful, but extremely confusing. Part of the problem with this system, even with the limitations is that players will often acquire an abundance of similar plates, which can't be turned in or redeemed for new skills or traits.  While you can throw some of them down in an attempt to increase the speed and power of certain abilities, the limited amount of space, along with the fact that a weaker ability place actually halves an ability's effectiveness discourages this action.  Even when you get into the later sections of the game and you gain the option to rearrange your ability grid to take off unused plates or shift these items around, you frequently find yourself lost in a blur of cluttered hexagons and not particularly identifiable sections that you want to edit without screwing up a character.  It can actually be worse for you to screw around with the grid, which makes absolutely no sense when you're trying to improve the skills of your party.   Then again, part of this could be because Growlanser: Heritage of War is one of the most underwhelming visual experiences that you will play on the PS2.  Honestly, most of the game looks like it was ported from a first generation PlayStation title, with basic character models, minimal animations and weak special effects.  In fact, it can sometimes be hard to tell what you're doing with certain attacks or magic spells, because unless it's a maxed out strike, visual indications of the power of a blow is pretty hard to determine.  While the few closeups on character models are rather sharp and detailed in their anime-influenced style, they're pretty static and are simply overlay atop generic backgrounds of woods, grasslands or other typical RPG environments.  It's pretty shocking just how poor the title looks, especially with such a high pedigree from Atlus.   If only the story and character development was better... While the visuals are weak, the sound is somewhat better, although the dialogue that the voice actors had is incredibly bad.  Many of the lines are simply absurd or atrocious for anyone to deliver in a title, and while the voice acting is fine, you will frequently find yourself rolling your eyes at the idiotic comments that each character makes in cutscenes.  At least the music is somewhat okay, although it's not anything that you'll find yourself focusing on.  Besides, you'll probably pay more attention to the game's battle music because of fights, and even that isn't too impressive.   It's pretty surprising when you open an incredibly stacked box of extras, including an art book, key chain and buttons and other extras, and find that those are probably better than the overall gameplay experience.  With an extremely weak story, annoying battle system and bland visuals, Growlanser: Heritage of War is perhaps the most disappointing chapter in the franchise.  Unless you're a hardcore fan of the series, you may want to seriously consider whether or not you need this title in your collection.", "date": "Oct 27, 2007"}
