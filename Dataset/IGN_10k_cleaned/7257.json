Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/18/bad-day-la-review", "text": "A sect of the gaming community has been waiting for a game that's fun but also makes some sort of artistic social commentary. American McGee's Bad Day LA was among the hopefuls to do so when it was first announced. Using a unique art style and humor, the game was intended to put the spotlight on the ridiculous amount of fear in the United States regarding just about everything disaster, disease, or terrorist related. The premise was strong. The actual result is a disaster scarier than most of those found in the game.   There's a laundry list of problems with Bad Day L.A. that wanders as aimlessly as the game from the lost potential of the art style to the inane gameplay and back humorless potty humor. It's hard to find anything that went particularly well with Bad Day L.A. despite the promise of something new, different, and fun.    Bad Day L.A. is set in Los Angeles and follows the story of a man named Anthony Williams who was at one time a successful agent and now homeless by choice. Much to his chagrin he becomes a reluctant hero as disaster after disaster strikes the California sprawl. Zombies, terrorists, monstrous tidal waves, earthquakes, and meteor showers wreak havoc on the hopeless inhabitants.   The pre-rendered cutscenes that show these calamities in action are the best and shortest part of the game. They demonstrate how lovely the art style could have been if given the needed technical attention. As it stands, the cutscenes only manage to show how sadly inadequate the in-game visuals really are. Style is slaughtered by poor execution. Chunky levels, awkward animations, low quality textures, and no noticeable flash or special effects create pathetically boring environments and action. It's obvious from the visuals that this game was created for a wide audience, not because of style, but because of the low technical requirements. There aren't even any graphic options aside from brightness, contrast, gamma, and whether shadows are on or off. No resolution options in or out of the game could be found.   The aim was mass-market success due to personality, humor, and some easily digestible gameplay. Unfortunately the humor is sadly juvenile up to the point of being tasteless and offensive. Keep in mind this comment comes from someone that considers fart jokes high humor. F-bombs and other four letter wonders abound but are used without timing or purpose. IGN isn't exactly a PG environment but curse words, when used for humor, should be more about situation and emphasis, not overwhelming force of numbers. Cussing does not equal funny. Crapping in the street does not necessarily equal funny. Neither does extreme violence. I'm not exactly a king of comedy but it's hard to imagine that I couldn't have done a better job writing less excruciating humor.     As we watched the two main thrusts of interest for Bad Day L.A., art and humor, thrash around in the gutter, we noticed gameplay was all too happy to stand lazily aside and watch them die. Level design is uninspired (which is confounding considering the subject matter), linear, predictable, repetitive, and aggravating. You'd think with the subject matter of disaster after disaster hitting Los Angeles they could have come up with some more interesting scenarios than constantly dousing the thousands of citizens idiotic enough to light themselves on fire, battle with gang members, and fight through belligerent airport security. The few glimpses of creativity are bound and gagged by poor follow through after initial concept.   Nothing demonstrates that quite as well as the four characters that tag along through the adventure. There's the sick kid that throws up, Mexican guy with a chainsaw and amnesia, blonde bimbo lady with the accessory dog, and one-armed colonel what's his name. They're there for personality but provide none, serve basically no purpose in gameplay except to suffer near constant death (which thankfully doesn't effect anything) and bum around while you do the fighting. There's no strategy or puzzle solving involved, which would have made more sense.   The action gameplay is equally as bad. Weapons are unsatisfying, enemies spawn randomly (half the time right behind you), snipers and gunners lock on and shoot from unseen locations, and there's basically no tactics or strategy even in boss battles. Getting new players into the industry means giving more interesting things to do, not less. Where are the mini-games, funny environments, and crazy gameplay scenarios? There's little redeeming about a title that originally held such promise. Instead of being showered with creative gifts, hilarious jokes, and unflinching social commentary we get bludgeoned with tired toilet humor, witless satire, and artless gameplay.Let's just keep it simple. Don't buy this game. It's terrible.", "date": "Sep 18, 2006"}
