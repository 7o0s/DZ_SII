Brought to us by the same team responsible for the upcoming XGRA and Alias, this budget-priced skin sport strives to be a better representation of the popular activity right from the outset. With various defensive and offensive techniques, attributes that actually matter, and real elements of teamwork, it's pretty much a given that it should be a superior product.   But the question is, ~Are those qualities enough to succeed in making a top-notch videogame?~ Or has Summer Heat Beach Volleyball fallen into the same trap that Tecmo's effort did by revealing a title that will more likely be overshadowed by its bikinied babes than its gameplay? Unfortunately, those are questions that Summer Heat can't answer very effectively.   Gameplay  To its credit, Beach Volleyball does a lot to improve on the simplistic guidelines set by DOA. Rather than limit its players to just a couple of standardized shots ala Dead or Alive, Summer Heat expands upon the model with three different kinds of maneuvers for every situation. Serving, passing, offense, and defense are all part of that philosophy, and it allows for players to adopt and create their own personal styles, techniques, and tendencies.   Characters themselves are rated in three varying attributes: power, control, and speed, and each combination of these lends itself better to certain styles. So while some players may not be able to pull off the savvier feint moves or net drops when using strong hitters like Maximillian, the personalities with higher control ratings will be able to finesse their way into some pretty crazy stuff. But that's where the game's main problem becomes rather obvious. As regardless of how well you diversify your team, no matter how difficult your challenge level is, and despite any variation in your opponent, the one thing that remains constant is that power players dominate the game.    So much so in fact, that there isn't a need for the majority of characters on the selection screen. Simply complete the training modes to access Tina and team her up with anybody to get started, and your duo will be close to unstoppable. The only tactics you'll need remember is to use jumping spike attacks almost exclusively when hitting to the other side and that CPU opponents readily ignore the corners. Keep that in mind, and victory will almost always be moments away.   Another big issue with Beach Volleyball is the sheer stupidity of your CPU-controlled partner. Dominant as you may be during the course of your experience, it's almost entirely user-enabled. The A.I. assistant will rarely do anything short of setting up the ball in order to get you to spike it, and ninety-nine out of a hundred times, your faithful buddy will take an almost entirely passive approach to every match. Given the relative ease of your opponents and the advantages of being a power player, though, this factor only makes a difference if you're purposely trying to lose.    Some of these problems can be forgiven when taken in stride, but one quandary in particular that really drove us nuts is that this game has some serious bugs. Originally thought to be our initial system, we tried Summer Heat Beach Volleyball on two other consoles with similar results: it appears that this game loves to lock-up and crash at the most inopportune of moments. For reasons unknown, our disc would constantly repeat one segment of a song over and over again in conjunction with the match point approximately 25% of the time. This phenomenon would then almost guarantee a lock-up or crash during a switch to the next camera angle, and we'd have to restart our tournament all over again. Admittedly, it's impossible to tell with only one copy of the game whether or not it was our disc that was problematic or if was Summer Heat in general. But this problem happened so often and hampered gameplay so much; we couldn't help but mention it.   That's not to say that our experiences were all bad. Beach Volleyball makes a few legitimate attempts at extending the value of its game with an included Beach House option that allows you to explore a virtual home. This tour-like interface enables users to walk through their mansion and check out everything they've accomplished or unlocked. And it's here that you'll find trailers to other Acclaim games, a jukebox feature, the ability to watch music videos, and several other neat little bonuses. It's an interesting approach that didn't go unnoticed.   Also worth mentioning is the excellent four-player mode. While the A.I. may not be worth a damn when playing solo, situations can change dramatically when hooking up to a multi-tap with your friends. It's with this option that an importance for teamwork and strategy truly comes alive, and for a brief, shining moment, Summer Heat becomes quite enjoyable. The only danger here is that after a few matches and the power-centric limitations of the engine are exposed, your buddies will begin to lose interest. We know ours did.     Graphics  Beach Volleyball's environments make for quite an interesting paradox. On the positive side, each stage is packed with an abundance of objects, spectators, and animations that conventional wisdom tells you should create an excellent presentation. Negatively, however, it is soon realized that the elements mentioned previously are as basic as they come. With little to no detail in structures or people and a quality of animation that we've seen bested in old Sega Genesis games (if you don't believe us, pop in Flashback: The Quest for Identity and see for yourself).   Character models for the players fare a little bit better, with additional detail and an emphasis on sexy walks and chest bounces that lonely people are sure to appreciate. Compared to DOAX, however, Summer Heat's male and female superstars are completely overmatched, and the designs and personalities for each are uninspired and somewhat generic. At least the lighting effects and shadows are well done, and the nighttime stage is pretty enjoyable. One thing that baffles us, though, is ~why only one camera angle per-side?~    Sound  Musically, Summer Heat offers an interesting mix of licensed songs and in-house medleys that capture the seasonal attitude of the game quite well. Pink, Kylie Minogue, and Suburban are just a few of the authorized talents that players will be able to listen to. And the Dolby Pro Logic II recording allows you to enjoy every last morsel of audio (or not enjoy it depending on your musical tastes).   Sadly, the robotic game show host that does narration isn't as interesting, and other than announcing players' names during introductions and offering score updates, he doesn't have much to say. Sound effects run the gamut of grunts, screams, and idle chatter, but none of them are particularly striking. What matters we suppose, is that these audio bits get the job done and the vocals that we do receive are definitely better than silence. We or at least, we think so.Putting it all together, Acclaim Studios Cheltenham has definitely outclassed Tecmo's Xbox volleyball title in terms of gameplay. With almost five times as many moves and techniques, it isn't hard not to. Unfortunately, being better than your competitor doesn't necessarily make you the best. In fact, it doesn't make you good either.Such is the dilemma we face with Summer Heat Beach Volleyball; it's one of the deepest games of its kind over the last couple of years for sure, but with an absolutely stupid artificial intelligence, an emphasis on powerful strikers, and an affinity for the jump spike above everything else, it's hard to recommend this one to true fans of the sport. That said, with T&A action included, an enjoyable four-player mode, and over 200 unlockable extras; Summer Heat might not be a bad pickup for its initial budgeted price.Just don't forget to remember that overused but popular old saying, ~You get what you pay for.~", "date": "Jun 30, 2003"}
