This was right after mobile Madden had debuted -- unspectacularly, I might add -- and there was talk of an internal drive to deliver better renditions of core franchises. He wasn't kidding. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 is a solid golf game that will make an excellent to-go companion for Tiger gamers that don't run with the likes of a DS or PSP.    I recently leveled some kind words at Gameloft's Vijay 3D duffer, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 deserves many similar kudos. The sport of golf's pacing is perfect for mobile gaming -- no need for quick action, save for tagging a few meters (which handled differently in this edition) -- and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 manage to recreate the not-so-leisurely activity with solid results. Getting in and out of a few holes is easy and satisfying, an absolute must for a mobile golf game.   For those with limited time budgets, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 offers a fast Quick Start mode where you can jump right in an start plowing through eighteen holes. You can play on the five courses you've already opened in the game's Challenge mode. Challenge mode is where players can take to the links with career golfers like Tiger, Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. After putting the game through the paces in the included Practice mode, this is where the majority of fans will spend most of their time.   The control in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 changes things up a little. EA, perhaps tired that every golf game now uses the same meter systems, has opted to jettison traditional meters and replace them with more contextual ones. Now, instead of tapping the buttons to set power and accuracy, you now try to swing the club itself by drawing your finger back on the d-pad, then pressing up for the follow-through. This works well on handsets thanks to the on-off sensitivity of the pad. On consoles, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 employs an analog stick, and with a zillion degrees of motion, the potential for disaster is far greater. (If you've played online Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 on the 360 with me, you can practically track my frustration levels as the game progresses.)   The courses in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 are excellent, but since they are based on the likes of Pebble Beach and Sherwood, they ought to be. Sand traps and rough patches are set up just perfectly to test the grace of golfers. Par is always possible, and with enough time in Practice, players can really get the courses down enough to give the game a run for its money. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 uses a download-as-necessary system on some handsets when courses are selected.   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 is playable on a variety of handsets that offer a wide spectrum of visuals. Base handsets offer a basic 2D game with decent looks, but higher-end models really offer a golf game that pops. The lush greens, the cobalt blue skies, the reds in Tiger's trademark outfit... all of it looks good. The camera placement is just right for driving and putting. The game also includes a Trophy Room that will start to sparkle when you complete challenges.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 is nothing short of a rock-solid mobile edition of EA's famous golf franchise. Almost everything you would expect is in here, from celebrity golfers to real-life courses. I was kinda hoping for a big ol' create-a-golfer mode like the console game, as some mobile golfers really like to put themselves in the game and compete. The new method of swinging the club works very well for mobile, and I wonder if other games will stick to meters or consider lifting this new mechanism.", "date": "Dec 7, 2005"}
