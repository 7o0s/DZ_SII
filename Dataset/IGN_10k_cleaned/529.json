The fart jokes, the cussing, the fart jokes and the cussing -- the television show has never let us down. Like, for example, that episode where Stan farted and everybody laughed. And who could forget the time when Cartman cussed uncontrollably? It's pioneering comedy like this that has made the show such a hit over the years.   Last year Acclaim Entertainment nabbed the rights to make multiple South Park games across all the major platforms and the world has never been the same. First came South Park 64, a game that is not even deserving of bolded lettering. This year comes South Park: Chef's Luv Shack, a simple, four-player oriented ~party game~ that takes on the skin of a television game show and sees players as contestants. Featuring oddball questions, cussing, farting, anal probes, traditional South Park characters, 20 mini-games and arguably funny sound samples, the game seems to have all the bases covered. But it does fall noticeably short in the amount of questions it serves up and the single-player mode is more of an afterthought than anything else.  The Facts  Compete in an off-the-wall game show hosted by Chef. Play as Kyle, Kenny, Stan and Cartman. 20 mini-games test the skill of players. 600+ questions in regular mode. Four-player support. High-resolution Java graphics. Original sound samples recorded by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.   Gameplay South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is more of less You Don't Know Jack minus the mini-games and plus the South Park license. Players control their choice of Cartman, Stan, Kyle or Kenny through a series of questions and answer sessions intermixed with mini-games. As contestants on Chef's Luv Shack, the characters must think quickly and buzz in their answers to questions appropriately if they are to have any chance of winning.   Acclaim Austin has done its best to whip up a colorful selection of questions and categories. We've got everything from ~Limeys & Teabags & Frogs, Oh My!~ and ~Lesbian Role Models~ to more gruesome ~The 'P' in My 'Pool'~ and the blatantly sexual ~Hot, Strong and Dark~ -- and these are just categories. Questions are filled with an odd mix of over-the-top bathroom humor, South Park related QA and, perhaps most weird of all, QA for 30-somethings. So, we've got everything from, ~Why does Kenny like...~ and, ~What organ makes urine?~ to questions that ask what happened to the lead singer of the rock band Styx after he went solo. We understand that Acclaim Austin is trying to keep the selection varied and open to gamers of all ages, but the target audience for a game of this type is most definitely not the 35 year-old Styx fan and this should have been taken into consideration.  More importantly, though, there just isn't enough QA to keep the game interesting for very long. Whereas You Don' Know Jack featured more than 4,000 witty questions for gamers to ponder, South Park: Chef's Luv Shack boasts a library of roughly 600, with an additional 200 or so in bonus modes. After playing the title for only a short while, you will see repeating questions. We did.  To its credit, Luv Shack has gone the extra mile to include 20 mini-games that separate the QA sessions and many of them take a nod to old-school classics. Asses in Space is basically Asteroids, Bad Kitty is Donkey Kong and for Atari players, there's even a Warlords remake. The game also features Frog Toss, in which players must toss our amphibian friends onto floating leaves for points. There's a mini-game that sees players bouncing balloons to a burning tree in order to put out the fire. There's Spank the Monkey in which players must do literally that; there's a whole lot to be done here and while most of it is undeniably simplistic in design, it's moderately fun regardless.  The QA sessions are spun at a tedious pace, interrupted by slow-moving animations of Chef delivering the mini-games, double-downs and pressure matches. Luckily for Nintendo 64 owners, the unforgivable load-times of the PlayStation and Dreamcast versions are completely gone, but the action still moves at a snail's pace all the same and it does get annoying. You'll find yourself constantly pressing buttons in order to speed up the action. The problem is that you can't.  One is the Loneliest Number... Chef's Luv Shack isn't a bad multiplayer game. The challenge is there, the questions are sometimes funny and the mini-games are nostalgic and addicting. As a single-player title, though, Chef's Luv Shack is downright boring. Acclaim Austin, in a brilliant design move, decided that single players needn't bother competing against computer controlled opponents. So, in single-player mode, it's just you. No competition so you always win. What, exactly, is the point?   Graphics South Park isn't exactly known for its brilliant animation and spectacular art. Rather, characters lack animation and move around like cardboard-cutouts. Backgrounds are generic and tacky -- it's what we've come to expect of the series and, strangely, it's even part of the appeal. Developer Acclaim Austin has managed to tap into the low effort look of the show perfectly, delivering horribly animated on-screen game characters and a variety of flat backgrounds. The game runs in high-resolution mode for crystal clear poor animation and 2D sprites. The look is fitting enough and at the same time, it's just plain bad. There is absolutely nothing in South Park: Chef's Luv Shack, visually speaking, that couldn't have been done just as well as an Internet Java game.   Sound The Nintendo 64 version of Luv Shack is a bit of a mystery as it's much better than both the PlayStation and Dreamcast incarnations. It has no load time. It moves along faster (somehow). And the sound samples, despite the cartridge format, are right on par with the competition (and in some cases they're of even higher quality). The only problem is that the N64 game doesn't feature all of the audio in the other versions. However, all of the South Park greatness that you'd expect is in the title, including a whole slew of original sound samples recorded by show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Lots of bleeped cussing and obnoxious yelling make up most of the audio, along with commentary from Chef. If you're a South Park fan, you're bound to find something in here that makes you happy, be it farting or cussing. Well, here it is, South Park turn game show. Is Chef's Luv Shack really worth looking into? For PlayStation and Dreamcast, no. For Nintendo 64, perhaps. The title features 600+ colorful questions, 20 mini-games, original sound samples and graphics very reminiscent of the show. On the other hand, the title only features 600 questions and everything is brought together at a terribly slow pace. While the multiplayer mode is decent, the single-player action is, well, a disaster -- and a boring one at that. Then we throw in the facts that only four characters from the show are playable, some of the questions are aimed at 35 year-old Styx fans and the graphics are unimpressive to the point that we believe they could be done just as well as an Internet Java game. Not exactly a thriller. The game only comes recommended to hardcore South Park fans. Others may want to give it a rent first and test the waters. They might be a little too shallow for the majority of us.", "date": "Dec 14, 1999"}
