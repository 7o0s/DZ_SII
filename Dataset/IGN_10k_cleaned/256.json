{"name": "Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear", "name_review": "Rogue Spear", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/25/rogue-spear", "text": "Last year, Red Storm Entertainment came out of nowhere and released Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, one of the best shooters of 1998, and arguably one of the best shooters ever.  This game redefined the genre, giving gamers the feel of real combat with real bullets and the real consequences of being blasted with a shotgun.  The sequel, Rogue Spear, does a great job of furthering the series, adding several new features to an already exceptional game design.     The storyline is extremely solid and intriguing, something which is often lacking in most shooters.  Of course, Rogue Spear is a shooter of a different cut.  One without health packs and super-futuristic weapons.  Death is as close as one shot away (although in one mission I did take 22 shots before I went down.  Hey, what can I say, I'm a bad-ass!).  And since you're usually taking on a superior number of forces, the game stresses solid strategy and planning instead of running in with guns blazing.  Regardless, the designers have managed to keep the game story coherent and realistic while still keeping you busy with plenty of heart-thumping action.    While your anti-terrorist organization will see action on three continents, most of Rogue Spear takes place in parts of Russia and the former Soviet states.  One nice carry-over from the Eagle Watch expansion pack for Rainbow Six is that many of the missions take place in real-world places.  For example, I was walking around the first mission area and one of the tech guys comes up behind me and says, ~Hey, I was just there last week.  Go down those stairs and check out the Egyptian exhibit, and see if you can find my jacket ... I left it there.~ He had just gotten back from a trip to New York and this particular mission was a hostage rescue in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Very cool!  Those of you familiar with Rainbow Six will be able to jump right into Rogue Spear without having to even crack open the manual.  The controls are basically the same as in the original, with a few keys remapped to give it the playability of a more standard shooter like Quake or Unreal.  For the most part the game handles extremely well, running smoothly on all of the systems we tested it on. However, the controls can be a bit sticky at times and the mouse fire button is sometimes non-responsive when there's a lot of action happening on-screen.  This is particularly frustrating at certain key moments, like when a group of four terrorists come running down a hallway toward you.    Like Rainbow Six, when you start a mission, you can either opt to go with the pre-determined routes, weapon loadouts, and squad assignments or choose your own.  You can customize all of your team members and their paths if you want, but I usually just use the default paths (the people who set the routes did make the game after all, so they probably have a fairly good idea of where to go) and alter the weapon selections slightly to suit my taste.  If you haven't played the original Rainbow Six (and, according to PC Data statistics there are about 4 of you out there who haven't), there are a number of handy practice tutorials to get you up to speed before you jump into the actual game.  Unlike the simple sweep and clear missions of Rainbow Six, sniping plays a much more important role in Rogue Spear, and there are a few missions which are almost impossible without a couple of snipers to hang back and pick off some baddies before your team goes into the hot zone.  Of course, to that end, there are a number of new long-bore sniping weapons added to your arsenal, as well as several more assault rifles and shotguns to boot. Bullets also come in multiple types now (full metal jacket and jacketed hollow point), giving you more of a range when it comes to outfitting your operatives.  Now you can opt for bullets that  pierce armor better or are more suited for tearing through flesh and bone.  While, at its core, Rogue Spear plays almost identically to Rainbow Six, the design team has incorporated a number of new features to make this sequel even more enjoyable and playable than the original.  One of the best new features is the ability to lean around corners.  In the original you would literally have to step around a corner to look for possible baddies, leaving your entire body open as a target to anyone with a gun.  Now you can just poke the top of your head around a bend and check out the scene without as much risk of being shot.  You can also move while crouched now, allowing you to duck-crawl behind desks and other low-lying objects for cover.   These new movement options really enhance the gameplay to a degree that was missing in Rainbow Six, but I'd still like to see a jump or dive feature so I can quickly get out of an area when one of my dumbass co-workers decides it's a good time to toss a grenade into a room I'm clearing.  Oh wait, that was me.  Sorry, Trent.   Of course, when it comes down to it, the number one defining feature of any shooter is the Artificial Intelligence. The development team obviously paid special attention to one of the most notable downfalls of Rainbow Six as the AI in Rogue Spear is quite good overall (both on your side and for the terrorists). Attackers come running to help their compatriots if they're within earshot of the battle.  Your team members will survey the scene and defend your back when you're picking a lock.  Some enemies have dead-eye aim and can pick you off from across a wide hall, while others couldn't hit a slab of beef at three paces.  However, the AI engine is not without its flaws.  Sometimes enemies will run up to you and just stop, waiting to be shot.  Other times your back-up guys won't respond to impending danger, letting you get chewed up by a treacherous foe without so much as squeezing off a round.  Sheesh!  Little help, please. Thankfully the pathing system in Rogue Spear was greatly improved over Rainbow Six, preventing your teammates from sandwiching you in tight spaces which effectively trapped you for eternity.   While gameplay stays pretty much true to the original, the designers have really beefed up the single-player game by adding a few new modes.  First there's the Lone Wolf mode, where you take on an entire mission with just one guy, your goal being to get from one end of the mission area to the other.   You can also opt to run each mission in Terrorist Hunt mode, in which each map is populated with 30 bad guys and your sole purpose is to take out everyone that moves.  There's no hostages to rescue and no objectives to complete -- just a bunch of fools to cap.   There are 18 single-player missions in all, including a Jumbo Jet in Brussels, the Opera House in Prague, a burnt-out city in Kosovo, and a dilapidated fortress in Azerbaijan.  While some players may zoom through the single-player game at the recruit level, the game is quite challenging above the veteran level and it will take a while for even seasoned players to work their way through the entire game.  You mission customizers out there will be happy to know that Rogue Spear does include a game editor.  Unfortunately, the editor isn't mentioned at all in the manual and the interface isn't very intuitive, so it may take some time before you're comfortable designing your own placements or enemies.  It's not easy to use, but it is in there.  As good and satisfying as the single-player side of the game is, the lasting appeal of Rogue Spear really lies in its multiplay options.  In my opinion, there's no better multiplay experience available today.  Yes, there are certainly lots of great shooters out there, but none are as in-depth and fulfilling as Rogue Spear.  There are a number of team-on-team options in Rogue Spear:   Survival: last one standing wins  Team Survival: last team standing wins  Scattered Teams: team survival with random insertion points for all team members  Terrorist Hunt: team survival where you can also win if your team kills more than half of the terrorists on the level  Scatter Hunt: terrorist hunt with rando insertion points for all team members  Assassination: like team survival, but each team has a General they must defend from being killed  Scatter Assassination: self-explanatory  Save Your Base: team survival variant where each team must make their way to their base and disarm a bomb before it detonates  Double Bluff: like team survival, but each team must get a hostage back to their baser safely  Stronghold: like team survival, but the gold team must prevent a member of the gold team from camping in their base for 3 seconds (sounds easy, but 3 seconds is a long time in Rogue Spear)  Double Stronghold:  like stronghold, but both teams defend and invade  Whew!  As you can tell the team-on-team options are simply amazing, and greatly enhanced over Rainbow Six.  But for me the real fun lies in the co-op modes.   You can only opt to complete the standard missions as a team or go for a cut-and-dry terrorist hunt, but there's nothing quite as gratifying as going into a mission area with a full team of eight over a LAN where you can all scream phrases like ~Open the door on the right and I'll chuck a grenade in and clear the room,~ or ~Man down! Man down!  Wait a second, that was you, wasn't it?  You shot me in the back!  You $%#&!~  One of my few problems with the multiplayer side of Rogue Spear is that your insertion point is often surrounded by enemies when you begin a mission, making it nearly impossible to even move without being shot.  But, in all fairness, this only happens on a few missions.  Graphically, Rogue Spear isn't that much better than Rainbow Six.  But if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The rooms are more detailed with more objects and better lighting effects, and the character models look a bit smoother than they were in the original, but it's not a major overhaul.  Like Rainbow Six, there are still some nasty clipping problems and dead bodies fall through walls and stairwells.  It doesn't affect gameplay, but it sure does retract from the realistic feel of the game.  The sound in Rogue Spear is simply amazing, and the designers did a great job of utilizing 3D surround effects to get you into the feel of the game.  If you're lucky enough to have a four speaker setup, you can actually tell where the action is taking place simply by following the direction of the gun shots.  Of course, you may want to avoid charging directly into a firefight.  One of the neatest sound effects in the game will only be heard if you're a little too close to a grenade when it detonates.  Your speakers will chime loudly and ring for about 30 seconds, just as if you really were next to a loud explosion.  As good as it is, the game isn't perfect.  In addition to the intermittently unresponsive controls and the occasional AI quirk, a few other problems are apparent in the game.  Nothing horrible, just some minor annoyances.  For example, you can't shoot through objects like wooden doors which should be penetrable with a high-powered gun. Although this was a feature that was supposed to be included in the game, it certainly doesn't appear to work.  I've picked up someone on my heartbeat sensor more than once on the other side of a door and unloaded a full clip from my M-16 through the wooden door only to have him open it up and shoot me in the face while I'm reloading.  Another nice feature would be the ability to use the weapons from your fallen foes or teammates.  While a member of a special operations teams would never take a terrorist's weapon over their usual weapon, if they run out of bullets, I'm sure they wouldn't mind picking one up to defend themselves in a fire fight.  It's also a pain that if one hostage dies in a terrorist mission, the mission automatically ends.  In real life no anti-terrorist team would just give up if one of the hostages was shot so it shouldn't happen in Rogue Spear.   This is supposed to be an authentic simulation after all. But, when it comes down to it, these are mild nuisances and detract very little from the overall game.  Rogue Spear is an incredibly well thought out and well executed game that should prove to be a lot of fun for almost any gamer.  Although this game isn't as revolutionary as Rainbow Six was when it hit the shelves last year and doesn't do much more than ride off of the laurels of its predecessor in the single-player mode, the game expands so much on the multiplayer aspect of the game that it has quickly become a favorite around the office at the end of the day.  It's certainly in the running for Best Action Game of '99.  Get off your ass, walk out the front door, and go buy a copy of this game now.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Sep 25, 1999"}
