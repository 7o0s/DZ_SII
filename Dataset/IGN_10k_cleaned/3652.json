This silly distraction stars you as a action hero who must recover his kidnapped girl from a gang of shoe-throwing bad guys with names like Doggy and Dighead.  Sounds almost too kitschy to be fun, but that's part of the surprise and charm of Charisma Lee.  Features: First-person action game 3 stages with bonus rounds High score rankings   Charisma Lee is first-person beat-'em-up of sorts.  Each level is comprised of two stages: battling your way down an obstacle filled alley and a boss battle.  Everything is viewed from the eyes of Lee.  You must use the 1-6 keys on your number pad to punch high or low, from left to right.  It takes a little getting used to--expect to lose the first few games because you instinctively dart your eyes down to make sure you're hitting the appropriate button and miss another obstacles coming your way.  The game starts with Lee reading a note from a gang of street punks, affectionate known as The Punks.  They have your girl, Susan, and if you want her back, you're gonna have to go through a few henchmen first.  (~Ha! Ha! Ha!~ says the note which throws down the gauntlet.)  Before you can ~defeat the Doggy,~ the first boss, you must fight your way down an alley.  Somewhere at the end of the alley, Doggy is hurling pop cans, shoes, and trash cans toward you.  Time your punches to deflect the hazards.  Get hit, and your life gauge goes down.  Thankfully, deflecting some of those items reveals food power-ups, like fried chicken, that replenish health.  At the end of the alley, it's face-to-face time with Doggy.  He'll dart all over the screen, so watch carefully and time your punches just as he moves or lets his guard down.  Land enough blows, and Doggy squeals on the next boss, Dighead.  Then it's back to the alley, fighting your way to Dighead, who informs you that Susan has undergone some serious Stockholm syndrome.  She's been so impressed with the Punks fighting ability, she's now in love with the final boss!  The 7-9 keys are assigned to power-ups.  Fried chicken replenishes life.  A heart container refills the entire health bar.  A jug of alcohol is likes Lee's spinach.  It gives him a temporary boost of strength.  It's clobberin' time, Doggy!Charisma Lee is one of those outta-nowhere games that manage to worm their way into your heart.  The game is just a complete goofy, complete with intentionally bad dialogue, awful character names, and tongue-in-cheek action.  Any fan of cheap kung fu movies will get a kick out of Lee's adventures.  Others, though, may find the shallow gameplay too off-putting.", "date": "May 21, 2003"}
