After all, what could be better than a game featuring the combos of Tekken, Dead or Alive's gameplay, and Tobal 2's superb grappling system? Unfortunately, for what the game had in potential, it was largely lost somewhere between the drawing board and the production plant.  In its favor, Kensei boasts an impressive framerate and realistic character motion. Not in the neighborhood of Tekken 3 by any stretch of the imagination, mind you, but quite good regardless. It also boasts a surprisingly well-done system for reversing attacks and grappling opponents, which, quite often, results in comedic back-and-forth melees as fighters attempt to win the upper hand. Unfortunately, Kensei's less stellar attributes greatly overshadow both.   While the game moves rather smoothly, it does so at an extreme sacrifice of character and environment detail, resulting in stages and fighters that possess little flair, and are ultimately downright generic. This is furthered by the fact that the characters themselves really aren't that well designed or engaging in the first place. The fact that there are more than a dozen fighters in all may sound impressive, but it's considerably less exciting when you consider that they are all very similar in appearance and control.  Making matters worse is the often unbearably slow response encountered when attempting to throw punches and kicks, or execute combos. Such delays are customary when going into super moves in other fighters, but in Kensei's case they're the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore, the aforementioned combos themselves are rigidly pre-defined, allowing little room for players to get creative.  In a catalog featuring the likes of Tekken 3 and Dead or Alive, Kensei needed to hold something truly special to make a name for itself. Instead, it has proven a strictly average offering with some truly serious flaws; a prime example of good design meeting with poor execution. As such, it cannot be recommended to anyone but those who simply must play every fighting game that hits the market  and even at that it should be considered a rent-only proposition.
