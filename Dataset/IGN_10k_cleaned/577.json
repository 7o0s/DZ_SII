It seems that a game has to possess ~polygons~ in order to be labeled ~good.~ NHL Face Off '97 lacks polygons, but it definitely has some of the best on-ice gameplay to date. Games like  NHL Power Play look really good, but still don't play as well as sprite-based ones.  NHL Face Off '97, regardless of graphics, has to be the best hockey game on the market for the PlayStation. In addition to its exceptional gameplay, it also has a lot of cool options that make the game even more enjoyable. You can sign on free agents, there's a player trade option, Exhibition and Playoff modes, single and/or multi-player Season modes, team and player stats, and my personal favorite, create a player. For someone who can't ice skate to save his life, body-checking a player like Mr. Jagr is always rewarding. No hard feelings right? With improved icon-passing and an AI with some attitude, this game is a definite improvement from last year's version. The only vise is the passing. It can be a little too accurate sometimes. Even at the highest difficulty level, you can still pull some easy goals (or maybe it's because I'm using the Redwings hehe). Anyhow, two-player games are always a blast and eight-player games are even crazier. What do you think we do all day? Play Sonic (yeah, right. ed.)? The question you've got to ask yourself is, ~Graphics or gameplay?~ The choice is yours. Sprite-based characters are a dying fashion, and polygons are in and here to stay, which is fine. Unfortunately, polygon graphics and fast-paced gameplay are still difficult to make successfully co-exist with each other, with one real exception: NBA In the Zone 2. But that's the only one so far.", "date": "Jan 28, 1997"}
