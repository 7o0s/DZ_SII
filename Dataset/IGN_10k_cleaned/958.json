Much like the console itself, they were unable to wow gamers with flashy graphics or orchestral sound, and so could attract on one basis alone: they must be fun to play over and over. Konami is attempting to prove that these old-timers still have the pulling-power by releasing this little package, volume two of a continuous series. Unfortunately, simplicity can be a bad thing, and games differ from fine wine in that they don't always age gracefully. Features: Parodius, Block Game, Track & Field and Frogger. Variable levels of difficulty. Battery save for high scores For Game Boy and Game Boy Color Konami GB Collection Volume 2 is divided into four specific games, a majority of which existed on the Game Boy back in the dominating black and white days. Parodius: This classic side-scrolling shoot-'em-up is marginally the best game of the four. That's not to say it's worth the asking price alone, because it isn't; it's just fun to play and provides an ideal quick blast. Parodius was renowned for its wacky ideas, featuring controllable sea-creatures and imaginative bosses, such as a giant, dancing woman and a pirate ship with a cat's head attached to the bow. The only problem is that this translation removes most of the bold design. The eight stages -- each concluding with a one-on-one battle -- are fairly colourful, but the shades appear rather smudged and garish; there's none of the clarity seen in other releases. The tunes range from inane to pumping, though none are at all memorable. Another problem is the lack of heavy-duty firepower. Unlike R-Type DX, the sprites and effects are so tiny as to remove all sense of power. Shoot-'em-ups rely on giving the player large battles and meaty destructive capabilities -- but here you rarely feel as though you're wielding anything more offensive than a three-way peashooter. Your 'ship' can be upgraded through collecting the pods that enemies leave behind, but never to the extent that you'd like. And it's not only hard, but the worst sort of hard too. One shot will remove any powerups collected, and the default speed is so slow that avoiding further enemy fire becomes little more than luck. The infinite continues make matters worse, turning the game into a stop-start mess. You die, lose everything, progress a few inches; then die, continue and repeat from the top again. The lack of frenzied action or consistency makes the game get dull very quickly.  It's not a disaster though. Some satisfaction can be gained from shooting the waves of enemies, and the action can become quite frantic. Getting through the levels puts you back at the start, with the difficulty increased -- so there's good opportunity for high-score chasing. There's just never enough detail to make Parodius as exciting as other, similar, better games.  I'd take R-Type DX over this, any day. Block Game  This I'd never even heard of, which is strange considering it's been dubbed a classic. In actuality, it's little more than another take on Tetris -- another that fails to capture the fun-factor or replay-value of the Russian wonder. You control one of five ships, which vary only in appearance; these ships stay at the bottom of the screen and can be moved left and right. An unrelenting series of shapes rain down from the top, and it is your job to fire small blocks at them to form squares or rectangles. Any quadrilateral made will disappear -- but once a shape reaches the bottom, it's game over. The graphics and sound are both simplistic, but do their job well enough. It's never hard to see what's going on, and there's a good deal of skill required in choosing which shapes to take out first. The game is actually quite addictive: the speed increases gradually enough to stop it from getting too repetitive, though not so quickly that it becomes impossible to get a good start. As with Tetris, you can either play progressive levels of difficulty, where you have to clear a certain number of shapes before moving on to the next, faster stage, or a single, marathon session, where you continue playing until defeated. The scores are saved onto the cartridge, so the latter mode offers particularly good value.  Some variety is added by the powerups that certain shapes release once completed. These are fairly standard in their nature: you can freeze the shapes, make them fall faster, or destroy all the blocks on screen with a single button press.   All in all, this is a fairly addictive little title. The only drawback is that it fails to supersede Tetris in any way. If you're yearning for another puzzler, though, then this might be ideal. It is not, however, worth the price of the cartridge alone. Track and Field: This sporting-sim is one of the most well-known arcade games of its time. It sees you, a top-class athlete, competing against challengers from all over the world in a variety of sporting events. Unfortunately, whilst the premise might sound cool, the execution of this version makes it almost no fun to play. The whole game is taken up with the events themselves: you can tackle them either individually, or together in a championship. The graphics are fairly detailed, with everything that's important easily recognisable -- but the music is comprised mainly of annoying little beeps and the odd, forgettable tune. The gameplay is where it all falls apart. To control the athlete, you must hammer the A and B buttons as fast as you can to build up a power meter; the higher this meter gets, the faster you run. Not only is this extremely tiresome, but the layout of the buttons makes it very difficult to do effectively, and it gets harder still when the d-pad comes into play. On some events, you must quickly press a direction-key to jump a hurdle or throw a javelin, and as it's impossible to hammer the buttons quickly enough with just one hand, this means letting go of the other controls entirely. Games like this are obviously not suited to the Game Boy. Some of the events are fun for a while, but there's never any urge to do well. The game contains a mere five events, and they're pretty much all the same anyway, merely substituting different graphics as the results of your mindless button bashing.  Next! Frogger  The last game on offer defines the word 'simplistic' all on its own, which is quite a feat for one so old. All gamers must have played this in some shape or form, and this rendition is a solid enough effort. You must guide a series of frogs across a busy road, avoiding the lines of traffic, then over a river by hopping from log to log until you reach their home on the far side. Once one is safe, the next appears at the start. Rescue five and you move to the next stage, where the traffic is faster and the time limit tighter. There isn't much to say about this. The overhead view works very well, complementing graphics that, though basic, are never cluttered. The game is fast-paced and simple to play, with cheerfully frantic music that actually suits the game -- in short bursts, it is extremely enjoyable. Because the levels never really change, however, you're unlikely to get long sessions out of it, as it quickly becomes repetitive.  This is a reasonably enjoyable package of four pretty average games. None of them would be worth much on their own, but together they somehow become more than the sum of their parts. If you enjoy games of this nature, or have fond memories of a particular title, you'll get a lot out of it, especially with the chance to save scores and attempt to beat them later. If, like me, you prefer a little more depth, this is certainly not one to go for.", "date": "May 26, 2000"}
