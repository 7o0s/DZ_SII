Its quick push to a breakneck pace is a serious challenge, but one that will amuse and engage gamers that like numbing their thumbs with such tests of twitch skill. If you lean to the more casual side of the spectrum -- say, the eighth round of Tetris is fast enough for you -- then Super Sketcher might be a bit out of reach.   Those that sign on, though, will find a charming game loaded with personality and style. The hero, Sketcher, is a figment of a school boy's imagination, scribbled out on a notepad and breathed to life by a sense of escapism. The pencil of the boy is ever-present in Sketcher's life, hovering just off-screen until needed. You essentially control that pencil, drawing in elements that keep Sketcher alive.   Sketcher is always on the run. You have six different shapes you can draw to keep Sketcher in stride. Three of the shapes fill in gaps in the landscape. The remaining three create jumps for the hero. A meter on the bottom of the screen shows how far Sketcher must run to complete the level, so to reach the goal, you have to quickly hit the number corresponding to the necessary lines and shapes. If you miss, Sketcher stumbles and loses a little energy. If you hit a hot streak, though, you can go into Super Sketcher mode. For a few fleeting seconds, shapes are automatically drawn. Like star mode in Guitar Hero, players need to use this to get through the harder sections.   Super Sketcher includes a handful of minigames outside the main campaign, such as trying in the right shapes to leap over a stream of turtles or avoid a series of porcupines. Rewind is another good one -- as Sketcher runs back and firth across the screen, you must quickly draw the necessary shape to avoid defeat in the center.   The game, developed by Zio Interactive, is loaded with style. The hand-drawn effect is very slick, resulting in some great animation. When you go for Super Sketcher, the game uses a ~negative~ effect, turning black to white and vice-versa. The screens below give a hint at the game's personality, but it must be played to be appreciated.  Super Sketcher is a good game for twitch gamers, the kind of player that loves to memorize patterns in shoot-'em-ups or test thumb speed. I think seriously casual gamers will be put off by the challenge, but there's a marked difference between challenging and ~too damn hard.~ Super Sketcher is legitimately challenging, and it's hard not to feel a small sense of accomplishment when acing a stage. If you want something a little different, take a look. I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "date": "Sep 15, 2007"}
