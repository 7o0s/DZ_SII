But it turns out that, as Yoda says, there is another. For those either daunted or uninterested in platforming game play, Lavastorm has also cooked up an arcade-style goof in the vein of Space Invaders, starring the Incredible daughter, Violet.   Needless to say, this version of The Incredibles is not nearly as deep as the platformer, but it serves it's purpose as an easy action game that employs the license to a reasonable degree. Which is the nice way of saying ~cash run.~   As Violet, whose incredible talents include encasing herself in a spherical shield, you must roll back and forth across the bottom of a single screen, repelling enemy fire from UFOs under the control of nemesis Syndrome. It's a little like Arkanoid, in that you must bounce those bullets back to the top where they blow up the UFOs. Along the way, you'll pick up power-ups that speed your response or turn a single enemy bullet into a return volley of three.   The Incredibles arcade game looks okay. Obviously cut from the same cloth as the platformer, it features a good use of color and detailed sprites. The game does sport  an opening jingle.  Well, what can I say? This is the kind of licensed game you always expect. Which is why I enjoyed the The Incredibles platformer, and was bored by this. If all you want is a simple twitch game, then this download isnt a bad buy  but could I recommend Gamelofts Block Breaker instead? Sure, it doesnt have a Pixar license, but its a better representation of the concept.", "date": "Oct 8, 2004"}
