Now, to expect the same kind of experience in a home version would be insane, and to expect the same sort of gameplay on the Game Boy Advance would be even more so. Silent Scope on the GBA is an accurate port of the console conversions of the original arcade game. And truth be told, the game feels more at home as a handheld game. If only the teeny, tiny, far-away characters weren't so dang hard to see on the GBA screen... Features Arcade Mode and original Advance Mode Training missions Link cable support for four players (single cartridge) Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Silent Scope on the Game Boy Advance honestly isn't much more than playing any other target-shooting game without a handheld light gun. Games like Virtua Cop and Lethal Enforcers have been brought home several times before, both with and without light gun support, and the result is usually a dull and simple point-and-click challenge that makes you wish you actually made that light gun investment.  But Silent Scope's sniper design actually gives that point-and-click action a bit more challenge, since players need to be both sharp-eyed and quick-witted to knock out the growing enemy threat. Players sit several hundred yards away from ground zero and zoom in on the action through a simulated scope, pulling the trigger when they've got the enemy in sight. Precision is definitely key in this game, but so is speed; time's clicking away on the clock and a head shot scores more points and seconds than a leg or arm shot...and later levels get even more challenging because bad guys are a lot more spread out, and move around. And in some levels you're hovering in the air via helicopter, and the game simulates a ~hand jiggle~ which makes it even more difficult to get off a shot.  The Game Boy Advance version of the series adds more to the playtime by unlocking a brand new scenario, ~Advance Mode,~ after playing through the main scenario for a set amount of time. And for the first time in the series' history, the GBA version even offers a simple-but-fun multiplayer mode where players snipe balloons for bonus points. And because this mode only requires one copy of the game, it makes Silent Scope even more worthwhile of a GBA title.  But the nature of the game makes it difficult to play on the handheld. The controls are mapped fine on the system, with the R trigger simulating the trigger of the sniper rifle, and the other buttons used for speeding up or slowing down the speed of the cursor. But the far-away enemies and bystanders are extremely difficult to see on the LCD screen, especially in the dark areas where the black-suited bad guys butt-up against dark sides of buildings. If they stay on-screen for a few seconds, the game offers highlighted cursors that pinpoint their position...but by that time you might be out of time or, even worse, shot by one of them.  No conversion of Silent Scope will ever be as good as the original, unless, of course, Konami finds a way to offer a home-version rifle that the arcade version utilizes. But Silent Scope on the GBA is surprisingly fun in a mindless, twitch-action sort of way. The multiplayer mode that lets four players snipe away against each other on a target range is a great addition to a solid, if limited, action game.", "date": "Nov 14, 2002"}
