The firm returns with another licensed game from expert developer PopCap Games, and while the results are not as strong as Zuma, Astropop is nonetheless a highly engaging and very playable action-puzzler.   The game looks a little something like a hybrid of Klax and Arkanoid, both pretty damn good games in their own right. You pilot a spaceship that patrols the bottom of the screen as a cascade of colored bricks ease their way down. You must use your ship's tractor beam to grab these bricks and then spit them back up to the top to form combinations of four or more. They don't have to be in exact rows or columns -- they just must be touching, but diagonals don't count.   As you clear block groups, hanging bricks roll back, potentially creating more chains that result in pretty hefty bonuses. Between a few rounds, you'll be treated to little skill games that also reward you with substantial points.   Your Astropop spaceship is juiced with a few weapons as well as the ability to activate special bricks. You can use your blaster to eliminate bricks one at a time, or use a super weapon to really clean the screen. Some bricks cause all like-colored bricks to glisten, which makes them explode when linked up in a chain.   Astropop's action can get moving pretty fast once you whiz past the opening gauntlet of levels. The brick-o-meter that monitors how close you are to finishing a level seems to fill slower and slower, and those bricks start advancing at alarming rates. Fortunately, you can wraparound the screen when moving. If you are against the far right side of the well, pressing right again will pop your ship on to the left side of the screen. This makes it much easier to play, especially when things get frantic.   Astropop also bears some pretty solid production values, such as an MP3 soundtrack and speech samples. We booted Astropop up on an LG VX8000 and were definitely impressed. Not that voice turns the tide or anything, but it's good to see mobile makers giving a damn.   If you've played Zuma or Jewel Quest to death, make Astropop your next puzzler download. The game is extremely fun and a breeze to get into. From time to time the game will feel a little repetitive, but then it tosses a challenge at you to rope you right back in. Just good, clean mobile fun.", "date": "Jun 29, 2005"}
