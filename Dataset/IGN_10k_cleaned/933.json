With the release of Wipeout XL and Destruction Derby 2, you'd think that they would try and top these two shelf-shockers. What happened? Just like driving in the streets of Los Angeles, Rush Hour is going nowhere fast.  Rush Hour is an overhead-perspective racing game set in a 3D environment. This game offers eight tracks and a wide variety of cars. Along with a few key options and a somewhat catchy soundtrack, you'd think that this game would be good. Not to put a downshift in your gaming engine, but this game lacks in one very important element: fun.  One of the biggest flaws in the game is the sound. Aside from the lack of racing physics, they messed up on one of the most essential parts of a game: the sound. It isn't enough for faint tire skids and the hissing of static to stand in for good car sounds. Something more substantial is necessary, and Psygnosis didn't follow through.   Although this game has some major faults, there are a few redeeming qualities. My personal favorite is the replay feature - studying your mistakes up close can improve your overall racing skills. Another cool feature is the screen adjustment. Playing in ~wide-screen~ mode regains your sense of speed, which you tend to loose in the regular mode because of the high-placed camera.  Rush Hour could've been a lot of fun if Psygnosis had done two things: spruced up the sound and added some fun. Not to get R rated or anything, but guns or some colorful power-ups would have been a nice addition. Spy Hunter, RC Pro Am, APB: these are all overhead racing games that possess all of the above. Rush Hour could have captured the same nostalgia, but didn't.", "date": "Apr 15, 1997"}
