Beyond a couple of exceptions (i.e. Excitebike 64), motocross video games haven't been too fun since the days of Enduro Racer in the arcades.  Too may developers have relied heavily on the well-known licensed names to attract fans of this sport rather than trying to develop a game that not only simulates the sport with the best visuals possible, but also incorporating fun play mechanics.  Rare is it to find a motocross video game that contains both qualities let alone just one and that's why MX 2002 took me a bit by surprise.  Although I'm disappointed that the Xbox version of the game is hardly improved over the PS2 version in both gameplay features and visuals, the play mechanics and overall gameplay are some of the best featured in any motocross video game. MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael obviously stays true to all the big names and brands of motocross.  You have all the recognized motocross riders - Matt Walker, Casey Lytle, Nick Way, Mike Jones, and of course Ricky Carmichael - as well as all the brand name motorcycles and gear from companies like Suzuki, Kawasaki, Shoei, Answer, Fox, and several others.  The game features some very large indoor and outdoor racetracks for both motocross racing and freestyle stunt riding; many of them are based on real-life arenas though some, like the THQ Open, are obviously created just for the game.  So the authenticity of the world of motorcross is well-represented in MX 2002 and surprisingly, so is the racing technique that translates into some of the most interesting play mechanics for a motocross video game. MX 2002 features four modes of play: Exhibition, Freestyle, Career, and Multiplayer.  Exhibition essentially allows you to race any track that you can select. Freestyle is the stunt mode where riders perform a number of aerial tricks on a freestyle course within the allotted amount of time (five minutes at default).  Multiplayer allows two players to race against each other or compete in Freestyle event games including an interesting Bus Jump mode.  Career mode is the meat of the game; create your own rider, customize him with the right gear, and set him off on the motocross circuit of races and events.  Events are broken down by each week, where you can practice the course, race on the course, and even get instruction on the finer details of riding your two-wheeled rocket.  For those that wish to ignore this tutorial, good luck advancing to the later races as you'll need every trick in the book to get by the aggressive AI opponents.  Although I'm not a fan of motocross, I was impressed by the solid play mechanics demonstrated in MX 2002.  The feel of the game is pretty much on the arcade side where almost anyone can pick up the controller and start competing.  The challenge comes later when the courses get really bumpy and more curvaceous and the opposing AI riders aren't as forgiving when you pass them up; that's when you start learning to properly use the preload and clutch play mechanics.  Preloading for a jump is nothing extraordinarily new in a video game, but I really like how it's implemented in MX 2002.  Before each jump, you can simply accelerate through the top to get some air, but for the advanced players, you'll definitely want to get your driver to preload to get some really big time air.  Preloading is assisted by a preload meter; the longer you hold the preload button filling the preload meter will ultimately determine the height and length of your jump.  You can get some serious hangtime if you fully-charge the preload meter and that's both a good and bad thing.  It's a good thing for freestyle stunt racing since the more air the player gets, the longer they have to perform stunts and tricks in the air.  But in racing, you have to watch out how much you preload.  Sure, it's good to get lots of air to clear jumps, but overdoing it might send you flying farther than you want.  Worst case scenarios including landing in the middle between two jumps or heading straight down on top of the lip of a ramp (yes, big time ouch).  Thus it's essential to learn the track and get a feel of how much preloading should be down before each jump.  Then comes the use of the clutch and I believe this is something entirely new in a motocross game.  Those unfamiliar with manual transmission, the clutch essentially puts the motorbike in neutral.  Why the heck would you want to do this in a motocross game?  Well, if you hold the clutch for a brief second while revving the engine, once you release the clutch you'll get a boost of speed.  Although you really can't get this turbo boost when you're going at top speed, the clutch play mechanic becomes a very important feature, as it allows you to come out of turns quickly.  More importantly, by using the clutch, you can land from a jump without losing any speed; in fact, a well-timed clutch boost from a jump can actually have you going faster than you did before the jump.  In combination with preloading, players will find a unique type of tempo to the game as you're constantly preloading, using the clutch right as you land, sliding through a turn, using the clutch to boost your speed, and, sometime in between, perform tricks to dazzle.  This is what makes MX 2002 such an interesting motocross game; unlike other motocross games in the past, you're always doing something whether it's preloading properly before a jump, using the clutch right before your jump and after you land, powersliding through a tight corner, or performing a suicide no-hander flip.  The constant tempo of action is great for a motocross game that, for the most part, remains unchanged in the transition from the PS2 to the Xbox. MX 2002 originally released on the PlayStation 2, so how much better does it look and play on the Xbox?  Sadly, there are very few, if any, improvements at all for the Xbox version.  There's slightly better-looking textures in some of the levels, but for the most part, visuals remain unchanged.  That's a bit annoying since the game didn't blow me away with its visuals on the PS2.  Gameplay has hardly changed and while I applaud the cool play mechanics, the control still feels a bit too floaty; I often felt that the rider was ~detached~ from the ground when racing up and down the courses.  The wobbly feel can also be experienced when performing aerial tricks; I don't mind that the games allows some flexibility to perform tricks that could not be performed in the real world (i.e. double suicide superman flip) but the feeling of ~weightlessness~ while in the air is sort of disturbing.  But what disappointed me more was the lack of any additions to the Xbox version in terms of features.  For example, although I don't mind the pop alternative soundtrack too much, MX 2002 is a perfect candidate to use your own music as your sailing through the air, but nope, you can't use your own tunes while racing.  How 'bout a track editor where you can make your own racetracks or even freestyle courses?  I can admire THQ making a straight port of MX 2002 from PS2 to Xbox with little or no improvements, relying on the strong play mechanics of the game to pull it through.  As it is, MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael is the only motorcross video game on the Xbox for now and it's not bad at all.  But I expect a lot more, visually and feature-wise, when a game gets ported to the Xbox whether it's taking advantage of the powerful graphic capabilities or utilizing other Xbox features not found in other consoles.  It's still a good motocross game but let's hope the next motocross game from THQ will have a little more to give to Xbox owners than just a good - but unchanged - translation.  --Anthony Chau, IGN", "date": "Dec 6, 2001"}
