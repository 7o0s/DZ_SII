{"name": "Digimon: BattleSpirit", "name_review": "Digimon: Battle Spirits", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/01/30/digimon-battle-spirits-3", "text": "Whether you love the Digimon critters or think they should go to Digi-hell, you can't deny that Digimon: Battle Spirits is a significant release for the Game Boy Advance. This fighter is essentially Bandai's subtle admittance of defeat in terms of handheld gaming, as the company has never released a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance title due to its direct involvement of the Japanese competitor: the WonderSwan. In fact, the Digimon property was one of the reasons to get a WonderSwan due to its ~exclusive~ status on the Bandai handheld. All that has changed with the release of Digimon: Battle Spirits, since it marks the first time the series has ever hit a Nintendo handheld. And since it's the first Bandai game on the GBA, it obviously won't be the last.  But it's not like Bandai poured a whole lot into the development of its first Game Boy Advance product. Digimon: Battle Spirits is, essentially, a direct port of the same game that was released on the WonderSwan Color system two years ago. If you're not familiar with that system, it's fair to note that the WonderSwan is a far less powerful game system than the GBA, and the limitations really show up in this conversion. But even though the game's not quite up the technical standards of the GBA, and even though this fighter's a little on the simplistic side in design, Digimon: Battle Spirits is a fun little game that will certainly tickle those kids who eat, sleep, and breathe Digimon. Features Seven initial characters, more hidden Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance Digimon: Battle Spirits is a very untraditional one-on-one fighter that puts Digimon vs. Digimon in several multi-tiered environments. The idea isn't to simply pummel the crap out of the opponent using the standard and special attacks of each of the different Digimon characters. Just connecting attacks isn't going to win any fights...players will have to collect the colored orbs that the opponent drops after taking a few to the body. But if you get hit, you also lose orbs...and the challenge is to re-claim your lost orbs before the opponent scoops them up. The game only awards points for grabbing the opponent's orbs...it doesn't take away points for losing orbs, nor does it score points for recovering your own. The round ends after two minutes, after that the game tallies the winner based upon how many points he scored during the match.  The arenas are very platform-centric and encourage a little exploration since the arenas scroll in all four directions. Each level also has its own environmental quirks: slippery floors in the ice level, hazardous lightning in the haunted level, conveyer belts in the industrial level. Players can also score power-ups by interacting with the level-specific enemies...take these guys out during a fight, and they'll drop an icon that can be used against the opponent. Throwing a gear at the opponent will cause him to go dizzy and confused; nailing him with a baseball or metal sphere will knock him out for a bit, losing a good amount of spheres for a direct hit. Whack him with a clock icon, and he'll freeze...leaving the poor guy open for a mighty combo. But it's when Culumon floats in after two-thirds of the battle have passed that the tide can turn; the first Digimon to touch Culumon will Digivolve into the character's extremely powerful form, and he remains invincible for a short moment while any attack that hits will cause at least four orbs to fly out of the opponent. Ultimately, Digimon: Battle Spirits is currently as close as GBA owners are currently going to get to Super Smash Bros., until Nintendo finally gets off its duff and creates a pocket version of its own mascot brawler. The single player game even ends with a gigantic battle with a full-screen boss...shame he's so darn easy to beat.  The game is good fun for what it is, because the simple controls are easy to learn and very effective in pulling off effective combos. The game's single player mode is a little easy to complete; its fighting engine is more tailored towards its link cable support, so two-player battles are much more enjoyable than playing the computer. It's just a shame that there's not much to the gameplay beyond what you can see; there are only two gameplay modes (single player and two player). All the other features that are expected of a fighting game, such as a training mode where players can learn all the moves and combos, or  a quick-fight mode where players can pick the arena and the opponent, are not in Digimon: Battle Spirits. But at least Bandai popped for a cartridge save, since the game has a handful of hidden characters to earn. The development team also use the save memory to record high scores.  But along with the lack of any extras, it's hard to ignore the technical shortcomings of Digimon: Battle Spirits. The game is a direct port of the WonderSwan Color version released in Japan, which is made clear not only by the horrific NES-style music and sound effects (some of which even sound like they've been lifted out of an Atari 2600 soundtrack), but also the very strange inclusion of a textured border that runs about five pixels thick around the edges of the screen. The only reason I can come up with its inclusion is that the WonderSwan Color screen has a slightly lesser resolution...and instead of offering a larger viewing area on the GBA (potentially adding to the time in development), they simply bordered the screen. It's not distracting during gameplay...but it is obvious and strange to see. The background and sprite graphics themselves are acceptable for GBA standards because the characters and areas have been given a more pocket-friendly ~deformed~ style. But other than parallax scrolling, there aren't any really impressive special effects going on during the fights. Don't let the overall score fool you: Digimon: Battle Spirits is a surprisingly fun game. It's just lacking in a lot of features one comes to expect from a fighter It's a very cut-and-dry presentation...no storyline and no dialogue cutscenes, and the game doesn't feature anything beyond the single and two-player game modes. But what Bandai offers for the game design is pretty nice, if you can withstand the tinny NES soundtrack: the characters are drawn and animated really well, and the simple controls are very easy to grasp. Regardless if you're into Digimon or not, the game is an enjoyable fighter...just don't expect anything super deep.", "date": "Jan 30, 2003"}
