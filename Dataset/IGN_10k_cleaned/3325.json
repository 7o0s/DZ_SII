It was the Genesis system's pack-in because it was a decent technical demo for people to see what the system could do in its first generation; Altered Beast showed off a decent amount of on-screen colors, multiple scrolling layers, gigantic sprites, and digitized speech (who can forget ~Wise fwom your gwave!~). The name may tickle many people's nostalgia buttons, and its man-transforms-into-beast idea is a good concept for a videogame, but it was seriously lacking in the depth department; after about an hour with the game any average gamer pretty much saw all there was.  Because so many people owned the game back in the Genesis days, the Altered Beast name lives on in so many gaming memories, and THQ's partnership with Sega has given new life to the old idea. Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms takes the game design formula established in the original and builds off of it with new techniques, creatures, enemies, power-ups, and boss battles. The original game's feel is here, but the new elements essentially make this follow-up a much more enjoyable adventure. It's still not very deep, but this Altered Beast follow-up is surprisingly fun in a mindless sort of way. Features 15 levels 10 different beast forms Cartridge save (one slot) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  The All-Powerful Zeus needs your help, Guardian. A dark reaper, Arcanon, has invaded the many realms of the multiverse in order to attack Olympus. You, a fallen guardian, have been resurrected to defeat Arcanon by wiping out the evil threat within each of the different multiverse realms. As this guardian, it's your duty to wander these 15 different realms, each with their own general theme; Crete features the classic Greek ruins, while Dubari takes place in an underground cavern. Each realm has its own energy that can be collected; by wandering the land, kicking and punching enemies as well as jumping between platforms, you'll encounter hooded creatures that release Spirit Balls. Collecting these balls, one by one, will increase your power. After collecting three balls you will transform into that realm's guardian creature, each creature having its own unique pros and cons in its movement and attack.  The Game Boy Advance game is incredibly similar to the Genesis game, right down to its two-player co-op mode using the link cable, but the GBA title is a brand new development with its own art and animation. The development team, the now-defunct 3D6 Games, set forth the task of recreating the original games feel for purists, while adding gameplay elements that would add the much-needed ~fun~ and ~variety~ items to the classic design. Most notably is the addition of power-ups that increase the guardian's attacking ability; players can knock down pillars, walls, vines, or other specific realm structures to release random icons that will replenish their health, increase attack power, speed up their movements, or unleash violent effects that will wipe out a full-screen of enemies. The entire roster of beast forms has also been completely changed from the original, though some classics return; there are ten different, and really cool looking beasts to tame in this game: werewolf, giant snake, winged dragon, weretiger, spiked turtle, wereshark, rhino, scorpion, eagle, and chimera.     The punch/kick/jump action itself remains the same as the original, but the developers created a much wider range of creatures that can be ~read~ a lot easier in order to avoid getting hit by them. All enemies have a specific weakness towards one of your guardian's attacks, and it's learning the ~pattern~ that is one of the game's challenges. The end-level bosses in the GBA game are a little easier to defeat than the gigantic head beasts of the original game, but they're not cheap in their attacks. And the designers actually utilize the GBA's strength to create clever beasts that rotate and scale to animate; though I'm not sure whose bright idea was it to create the gigantic, full-screen worm boss that wiggles and thrusts in a most peculiar, almost sensual sort of way...  The developers actually encourage level replay in two ways. Players have the ability to unlock different versions of that realm's beast in the second, third and fourth times through that one specific level. But don't get all excited, because the different forms are simply pallete-swaps of the same creature, labeled something cool, like ~Obsidian Canis~ for the golden wolf, or ~Metallic Draco~ for the silver dragon. The game also limits the amount of times players can continue, but they can collect additional lives and continues if they play through the previously defeated levels...so, in theory, players are not just encouraged to replay the levels, it's almost a necessity.  The levels in Altered Beast admittedly tend to go on a bit longer than they should, though, never really altering the form of the levels beyond what's in the first hundred feet of scrolling. It's also a shame that the game's level structure is just as forced as the original game. Each level follows exactly the same ~wander the land, turn into the specific, predetermined beast, fight the boss~ formula, and it's no real challenge or surprise when you've turned into that realm's beast, and other than the game's unique four-player link cable battle mode, there's no way to actually choose which beast you want to be. once those Spirit Orbs are released, it's almost a challenge not to grab them. But that doesn't make the game super easy or anything; its actually a challenge to get through the game's levels. And just because you're a beast doesn't make you invulnerable, in some cases there are downsides: the rhino, for example, will ~charge~ during his attacks, and if players aren't careful, they'll find themselves charging right over a cliff and lose a life. I was honestly not expecting to like Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realm. It had a few strikes against it well before its release. One, the original game admittedly wasn't the deepest game for the Genesis. And two, the game's first (early) appearance at E3 wasn't very favorable to the remake's presentation. And I'm being kind by saying it that way.However, the final product surprised me in several ways. The development team actually managed to recreate the original game's feel, all the while actually adding elements to make the game a fun little romp on the Game Boy Advance. It's not a hugely amazing game, but Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms is a fun remake of a bland Genesis game...and it's rare to say that a Sega remake, developed by a US studio, is better than the original. Nice work, guys.", "date": "Dec 12, 2002"}
