The popularity of the World Wrestling Federation kept the buzz going on this one throughout the summer and in spite of numerous delays. Originally scheduled to come out in June, Attitude went through a lot of tinkering and adjustments before finally arriving in the hands of drooling, unsympathetic videogame/wrestling fans. This is a rabid, hard to please group, but this second WWF game from Acclaim may have pulled it off.  The Facts  256 megabit (32MB) cartridge. More than 40 wrestlers.

Gameplay Attitude does not suffer from a lack of options and features. From all the Create-A-Whatever features to the 15 game modes for single players only, you can go a few weeks before you get all the way into this game. The Create-a-Wrestler mode is ground breaking and has set the standard for player editing functions in not only wrestling games but in any title that offers players ways to tinker in the game engine. We did a special feature on the Create-a-Wrestler function earlier this year and rather than rehash it here, we encourage those interested to click right here  to get the skinny on making your own wrestler.   The game itself still plays like last year's Warzone with the D-Pad (or analog stick, if you're confident in your skills) and button combinations used to execute the moves. The debate over the button sequencing versus the grappling method found in games like THQ's WCW Revenge rages on but the bottom line is that Attitude's control system works just fine and doesn't take away anything from the enjoyment of the game. Some of the more complicated moves like The Rock's Laying the Smackdown will require some dynamic digital dexterity, but like all the best moves in the game, it will be worth it.  You will have to earn every victory since the power meters for the different wrestlers can rise and fall depending on the momentum of the match. You can have your opponent all the way down to no energy at all with not even a sliver of red showing and if he gains the momentum and stays on the attack, you can find yourself pinned with a big upset loss. This happened to us in a match playing as Kane versus the Undertaker and we took the loss even though the Undertaker was down to no health at all and we had a good 3/4~ of red health left. Tough lessons like this will keep players going against the A.I. of Attitude until they figure out what works and what doesn't. Knocking health off of your opponent's health bar is definitely an art and it will take a nice complex set of moves to do it quickly, efficiently and without losing too much health. A great way to learn finishing moves is to switch on Finishers Only as the win modifier for all of your matches. Likewise making your matches an I Quit Match will force you to master submissions and First Blood Matches will help you learn the most devastating, injury inducing moves. There's a learning curve to Attitude but Acclaim took care to teach you plenty of lessons along the way.  The career mode is tough and will test the most skilled gamers. You have to work your way up through the rankings before first challenging for the European Championship. Once you get the European Belt, you have to defend your title five times before the whole procedure begins again for the Intercontinental Belt and so on until you get to the World Heavyweight Championship. You get to see the list of guys ranked higher than you and you will wrestle all of them eventually. The catch is, Attitude doesn't just have you running through the wrestlers one by one in a ~who's next~ format. Oh no, you'll be cruising along just having picked up your third win in a row when all of a sudden you're in a 1 on 3 match against three guys that are all ranked higher than you. The beatdown is so quick that you won't have much time to wallow in the unfairness of the match. The crappy part is that you drop in the rankings every time you lose and you will have several of these ~impossible~ matches on your way to the belt. Sometimes you'll get a 1 on 2 match that will actually be manageable for the intermediate player. It's when you're ranked number 2 and all of a sudden you're thrown into a 1 on 3 I Quit weapons match that you'll be pulling your hair out and cursing the day you first watched a WWF event. This doesn't even touch on the injustices associated with a triangle match in a cage or the tag team gauntlet match where you have some assigned schmuck that you hate as your partner. It's all in good fun though so you'll get over it.  The Create-a-PPV is a nice idea that's easy to do and offers gamers a simple way to play commisioner. Not only do you get to pick the principals in eight separate matches, but you get to select the match stipulations and even change the look of the arena and truly make it your own Pay Per View event. Selecting the color of the ropes, posts, lights on the ring, introduction lights and curtains is about all you can ask out of such a feature and it's all right there for you. You can even choose which logos will appear on the ring apron. Choose from the various WWF logos or even choose from the variety of logos for already famous PPV events in the WWF like Wrestlemania and Summer Slam. The only thing that would've made this better is if we could write our own text on the ring aprons and banners, but this would be almost too much creative latitude for the average Attitude player.  Sound The audio elements of Attitude are outstanding top to bottom. It's not necessarily the quality that got to us, but the variety of bits and depth of the samples that made us take notice. During matches the punches, kicks and slams all come with the appropriate sounds of impact and reactions from the assailed.   The generic crowd noise is an interesting part of the game. When there's nothing going on in a little House match during a career mode, you can darn near hear the crickets outside the building. This is by design since it's the action in the ring that determines crowd noise and intensity. You're supposed to be putting on the show for the people so you've got to pull of the moves that dazzle them. This is a very good idea that will make players work to please the crowd.  Attitude can actually seem to lack a little pizazz during those times when you're trying to move into position while avoiding the opponent. The energy associated with the game seems to really go down unless you're close to the end of a match and trying to pull off a spectacular finishing move. The crowd reactions completely dictate the excitement you'll feel playing the game but, ironically, you're the one that's supposed to do the amazing things to keep the crowd buzzing the whole time.  The crowd does however make some great comments throughout the matches saying things to and about the wrestlers by name. It's great to hear some hick in the crowd yelling ~Yeehaw! Double Jay~ when Jeff Jarrett pulls off a move. The crowd has a few lines for each wrestler to keep it fresh, but in longer matches it can't help but get redundant. We can't forget about the actual comments the wrestlers themselves make while they're applying the beatdown. Austin will tell you throughout the match that ~that's the bottom line~ or ~aww, you've pissed me off.~ You can execute these taunts yourself when you're using your favorite wrestler by using a combination of the A, B and C buttons.  The commentary from Lawler and McMahon is great. The King is still his weasely self rooting for members of the Corporation and against the people he doesn't like. McMahon actually comes up with some pretty nifty catch phrases that are better than we expected. ~The Rock rocks the body that rocks the party!~ is a pretty darn clever line and he delivers it infrequently enough to keep it fresh. However like all commentary in any popular game, all of these audio bites will first become stale and then immaterial after weeks and months of playing Attitude.  The intros in Attitude are outstanding compared to what we were given in Warzone. The sequence for the Road Dogg is the new standard bearer for intros in a wrestling game. As soon as the guitar lick kicks in we get the ~Oh, you didn't knoooooOOOOW?~ and the whole nine. The great part is it's not stolen from a WWF CD or other cheap way. Road Dogg recorded the whole ~Tag Team Champions of the Woooooorld!~ speech just for this game and it sounds excellent. His gestures with the microphone and stroll to the ring are dead on. His is so good that you almost wish other wrestlers had more elaborate intros just so you could see what Acclaim can do with them. And just so you know, Edge and Christian do not enter the ring through the crowd like on TV. Edge does sort of hop out of the front row while Christian comes out Brood-style.  Graphics The characters in Attitude look better than Warzone's so the motion captured animations seem even more realistic. The movements in individual moves are a lot more natural looking and the wrestlers seem to have actual mass to them as they move about.  A running powerbomb looks great and you can almost see D-Lo Brown straining to lift his opponent and run across the ring with him before slamming him to the canvas. This is a great element of realism that some fans find more appealing than the almost mechanical movements of the muscular wrestlers in THQ's games.   One thing that we noticed is that not all movements translate well to videogames. When the Rattlesnake makes his way to the ring, instead of that no bullsh*t swagger we're used to seeing, Stone Cold seems to be moping along like he's lost his puppy or like he hasn't been to the bathroom in a long time. Wrist movements are limited so lots of grabbing and intricate maneuvers don't look very natural at times. But then when you see how the guys execute huricaranas or watch The Rock use the Rock Bottom everything seems fine. It ends up that the slowest, most subtle movements are easier to see and scrutinize but the nice quick, and even complicated wrestling moves look really really good and that's ultimately what's most important.  All of the frames of animation are present and accounted for in Attitude and we didn't see any slowdown that mattered to gameplay. This is partly because there's never more than four guys on the screen at any time and the fact that the crowd is a collection of happily assembled sprites that don't ask for much more than a good show from the animated grapplers.  Some parts of the wrestlers look a little strange at times since not everything can be detailed and visible. When you look at some of the tattoos available in the wrestler creation mode some of them look like wounds or other bad skin conditions. The scalp tattoos all pretty much look like wounds even when they're different colors other than red. They look like Vulcan wounds. Long hair looks strange as does the blood on injured wrestlers in the ring. Unnatural may be a better word than strange since anyone with hair that clings to the body like that or who bleeds giant red streaks from the side of their torso has a unique set of personal problems. These problems are all more or less forgivable since the models are so well done otherwise. Attitude was so hyped that when it finally came out we kind of felt a sense of relief and detachment since so much about this game had been covered already. The end result though, is quite a game. The sound of Attitude is going to be hard to beat. Both WCW Mayhem and Wrestlemania 2000 are going to have to work to come up with the same depth and detail of audio that Attitude has. Playing the game is a lot more fun than Warzone because of the better looking characters and audio components. As we said the Create-a-Wrestler is excellent plain and simple. The question is, which wrestling game do you get out of the big three coming out this fall? I'd have to say Attitude is the way to go if you simply can't wait and have been wanting this one all summer. It lives up to the hype. If you're undecided though I'd definitely wait for the final versions of both Wrestlemania and Mayhem since each of these games will have their respective strengths that will appeal to wrestling fans.Attitude is a better game than Warzone but much more so than the score reflects. Attitude certainly deserves a score in the high ~8s~ but it's more than a few decimal points better than Warzone.Are you a dedicated wrestling fan?
