{"name": "Spearhead", "name_review": "Spearhead", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/30/spearhead", "text": "When I first read a preview of Spearhead, Interactive Magic's new M1A2 Abrams tank simulation, I came away with the impression that it was going to be a game that appealed mainly to hard-core treadheads -- not the sort of thing for gamers like me who think manuals should be read only as a last resort, rather than being a prerequisite for completing the first mission.  But while Spearhead was partially developed by MAK Technologies -- the company responsible for creating training simulations for the U.S. military -- the emphasis here is definitely more on fun than it is on realism. That might come as disappointing news for sim fans who were expecting something along the lines of MicroProses's award-winning M1 Tank Platoon 2, but it's a godsend for gamers who want to experience the raw power of modern tank warfare without having to endure a steep learning curve.  Spearhead revolves around a fictional Libyan invasion of Tunisia, with the U.S. intervening to expel the intruders. You play as a platoon leader in the U.S. 3rd Armored Division, but in point of fact you're in command of all the forces that have been deployed in the area: you can call in air strikes and artillery support, and you can issue movement and battle orders to any friendly unit on the map. That might sound a little complex, but fortunately the game has been designed so you can win most missions with a minimum of guidance on your part -- a good thing, since the lack of any crew AI for your own tank means you must assume the roles of gunner, driver, and commander.  Spearhead features ten standalone missions, as well as 20-plus multiplayer missions and seven tutorials designed to familiarize you with target acquisition, gunnery, navigation, and the Inter-Vehicular Information System, or IVIS. The tutorials are perfect for novice tankers who want to hop in an Abrams and start banging away at those pesky Libyan invaders, but the good news here is that these missions are actually pretty fun even if you don't need instruction on tank warfare basics.  Would-be tank strategists will spend much time in the IVIS getting a handle on the tactical situation and issuing command to friendly units; unfortunately, the IVIS is the Spearhead's weakest link. Because you can issue commands to only one unit at a time, you'll have to Zoom in very close to differentiate them -- but when you get in that close the enemy you wanted to attack (or the location you wanted to send the units to) is no longer in view. This wouldn't be a problem if you could scroll the map or if the Mission Planning commands were on the same screen as the Zoom functions, but as it stands most players will only turn to the IVIS when absolutely necessary. Another problem is that the battle continues to rage as you examine the IVIS, so if you switch to it quickly to locate enemies or try to maneuver your forces you stand a good chance of being tagged by an enemy shell or anti-tank missile. That might be a nod to realism, but I think that the sort of gamers Spearhead will appeal to would appreciate an option to have the action pause while they use the IVIS.  The Campaign mode is where Spearhead offers the most challenge -- and it's also the source of some frustration. This is a strictly linear affair, and if your tank is destroyed or if you fail to achieve a mission objective you'll have to keep playing until you get it right. And even though the missions have been scripted so that enemies always appear in the same place and at the same time (the standalone missions offer some variation in enemy placement), you'll undoubtedly run into some battles where you're not really sure what you've done wrong. Just when that becomes frustrating rather than challenging will vary from player to player, but this is the sort of game you won't mind leaving on your hard drive so you an return to it from time to time and giving it yet another shot.  Interactive Magic is supporting Spearhead's multiplayer mode with a free Spearhead server -- a thoughtful touch, except I never found anyone logged on to it. I checked in at different times of the day over the course of a week, and not once did I find anyone in the lobby. That's too bad, because Spearhead's been designed so you can either approach it as a serious military simulation or a run-and-gun gunfest.  Spearhead won't win any awards for its individual components: the 3dfx terrain graphics are drab, the sound effects are limited, and the linear Campaign sometimes feels like nothing more than standalone mission strung together. But we've all heard the old saw about the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, and that's precisely the case with Spearhead. If you're looking for a high-powered tank game you can get into in just a few minutes and still enjoy weeks later, this is a pretty good place to start.  -- Chris Buckman", "date": "Sep 30, 1998"}
