Those of you who are into pure action shooters will find that Serious Sam is a non-stop blast.  Serious Sam owes serious allegiance to the days when action was king and ~plot~ was a paragraph in the manual.  There's hardly a second of gameplay where you're not fighting off some demonic nasty...or rather two-dozen at one time.  Don't expect to find any elaborate puzzles to solve or any complex storyline to follow. Serious Sam is all about heavy firepower and an endless stream of demented, horrific beasts whose only purpose is to make sure you don't make it to that door at the end of the hall.  Every shooter needs an ample arsenal, and Serious Sam doesn't disappoint.  Weapons range from the simple knife and pistol to the more powerful rocket launcher and SBC cannon, and of course there's the ever-satisfying shotgun. The arsenal may not be very unique, but it's certainly gratifying and extensive.  Ammo and power-ups are also plentiful, which is a good thing since you'll barely have time to take three steps before you run into the next horde of baddies.  All of this furious gameplay is wrapped in a simple yet effective interface.  There's nothing too intricate here -- just your basic menu system -- which gives Serious Sam even more of a retro feel.  There's even a ticker that keeps score while you play, and when's the last time you saw a score counter in a game?  One inventive touch to the interface is the NETRICSA system, which acts as a computerized manual of sorts, giving you data about that giant red scorpion who's aiming a chaingun at your head or that shiny new cannon you just found.  NETRICSA will update you when you encounter something new, so it's a handy resource to find out what your opponent's strengths and weaknesses are without having to leave the game.  Level design is nothing spectacular, but it works for the game.  The Egyptian-influenced levels are linear, but they're not designed for you to go searching about.  Remember, this game is all about constant action, not searching aimlessly for the next button or key...although there are plenty of secrets to find in each level.  There's certainly a nice flow to the levels and, although the same tricks are employed again and again, they never seem to get old because there's hardly any time to do any really analyzing while you're playing the game...you're going to be way too busy blasting your way out of a horde of demon spawn. And if you're up to the challenge, you can always use the included editing tools to make your own levels for the game with the included editor.  Croatia-based Croteam developed their own proprietary engine for Serious Sam -- the Serious engine -- and it looks and performs great.  Unlike a lot of the dark, drab shooters we've played in recent years, Serious Sam beckons back to the days of the colorful Doom.  The expansive outdoor levels are particularly nice looking, alight with a blaring sun and sporting an impressive although somewhat overused lens flare. Creature models aren't the best we've ever seen, but they're nothing to poo-poo on either.  The creature designs themselves would certainly strike terror in the heart of even the heartiest of stock, and you'll be trembling once you meet your first four-armed, fireball-shooting green demon.  One of the most impressive features of the Serious engine is the sheer number of models it can handle at one time without any noticeable slowdown.  You'll be in numerous fights where you're going up against a dozen creatures at once (and sometimes even hundreds), yet we experienced no choppiness, even on a PII450 with a Voodoo3.    The sound in the game is loud and crisp, although most of the sound effects sound like they could be in any shooter.  We were quite satisfied with the bass-heavy gun sounds and the cocky banter that Sam spouts out during his run through wave after wave of demons will leave you with a classic Duke Nukem feeling.  The Kamikaze bombers had everyone around me laughing every time they would come at me, screaming at the top of their lungs, presumably out of whatever hole was left in their necks since they didn't have the luxury of sporting a head (check out the movies below to get a taste of what I'm talking about).  Although this game is mostly about the single-player experience, Croteam did include one deathmatch level so you can do some blasting against your friends.  The co-op mode was more interesting to us though, as you can go through the entire game with your buddies at your side.  You can play these modes either on a LAN or over the Internet and, while we suspect not many of you will use this feature, through a four-player split-screen on one PC.  The net code seemed stable and on par with comparable shooters and, as of this writing, there were quite a few servers up and running, so it was never hard to find a game, especially since a matching service is included right in the game.  As the final score reflects, this game is more than just its parts.  Take it for what it is -- a pure action shooter -- and you'll absolutely love it.  It's not deep, but it's a solid shooter that packs in a lot of action for under $20...and that's hard to beat.   -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
