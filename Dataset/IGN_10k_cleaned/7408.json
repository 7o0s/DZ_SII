There's a lot going wrong with Sony's Ghostbusters, a mobile action-puzzler that trades on the good will of the license in hopes of drafting a few nostalgia-powered downloads. Your mission is to deny this game your dollars to further drive home the message that mobile gamers cannot be swayed by cool source material alone -- there must be compelling game play to back it up.   You enter a creepy old mansion all by yourself -- a faceless Ghostbuster recognizable only by the khaki jumpsuit and proton pack -- tasked with flushing out a number of ghosts on each floor. As you enter new areas, the game flags specific specters from a catalog of unhappy undead. You must weave through the maze-like mansion, doing all the staple actions of action-puzzle game play (colored keys, pushing statues, activating switches), and hit these restless spirits with your neutrino wand in order to move on to the next floor -- which looks remarkably like the other floors. Not that a mansion should have wildly different layouts, but something to break up the monotony would be appreciated.   I originally tested Ghostbusters early this year and wasn't as bothered by its paint-by-number game mechanics, but so much forward movement has happened in 2006 alone that Ghostbusters' shortcomings are highlighted and underlined. There isn't much joy in this watered down presentation of a beloved license, the level layouts are competent but not engaging, and at no point does the game ever get exciting. No game about zapping ghosts should inspire fidgeting.   The game looks decent by today's standards. I played Ghostbusters on a Sony Ericsson 710a. The sprites are decent-sized and fairly colorful, but that only serves to make the gray and brown mansion look even duller by contrast.  Ghostbusters joins Nightmare Before Christmas in the upper echelon of average mobile games inspired by my favorite movies. The promise of busting ghosts is strong, but this cookie-cutter game betrays any good will you might have toward the classic comedy. With such rich material, the developer focused on colored key puzzles? Really? There's a better game for this license out there -- I really hope Sony gets on it.", "date": "Oct 20, 2006"}
