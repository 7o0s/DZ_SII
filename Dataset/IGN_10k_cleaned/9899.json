After all, it was rude to make your friends watch you play the Genesis when busting out Mouse Trap or Sorry could include everyone in the fun. The idea of digitizing these classic games and combining them into multipacks on a portable game system ought to be a genius idea. Now kids can play them on the go, and don't have to worry about little plastic pieces that inevitably end up in the vacuum cleaner or dog's bowels. Somehow this multipack, Clue / Mouse Trap / Perfection / Aggravation falls short of what it could be. The problem occurs when the developer, Gravity-I, doesn't seem to know what made these games fun in the first place, namely actually playing with other people.   Board games are not fun to play by yourself. That's the nature of board games, they're all multiplayer. Even games like Perfection  technically a single player game  benefit from having multiple people around.  Thus, it's infuriating to see that the only multiplayer option within the game is multicard. It goes against the very nature of a board game. What if the physical board game Clue was only playable if everyone had their own copy? Sleepovers the world over would be ruined!   Seriously though, it comes down to a simple matter of dollars. The DS cart is $20. Two of the games in this pack support up to six players. If you wanted six players, that comes to $120. Even if you only want to support four players, that's still $80. However, buying all four board games comes to a little over $60. So to get the whole family to play, you'll have to spend about twice as much as it would cost to buy the actual board games (assuming everyone in the family owns a DS, that is). Plus, for that extra money, you lose the tactile interaction of a board game.   The idea of getting to play these games in the backseat of a car is a cool notion though, and maybe, if Gravity-I had made them fun to play, we could recommend them. But not one of these games manages to be entertaining.   It's a trap. In the most general sense, they all look pretty bland. Some of the games do feature 3D on both screens during the game, but there's just so little going on that it doesn't matter. A sense of excitement and charm was attempted through use of background music and an announcer. We can't tell if the announcer has a hard time with the English language, or if he just sucks at his job, but every time he announced a player's turn by shouting the color (Purple!) we wanted to punch him in the face.   While all the games technically play correct, they all feel lifeless. It's like the developers didn't grow up playing these games, and thus don't know the little nuances that make them fun or challenging. Each game has some major flaw to it that severely limits the amount of fun that can be had.    Clue restricts the use of the notepad, the single most important tool in the game. Players cannot make notations on it, so they can't fill in boxes to mark objects they've deduced. It forces you to play the game stupidly, hoping that the AI or friends don't happen to guess before you.   Mouse Trap doesn't even let you build the trap. That's most of the game right there! Every time we landed on a build square the game would just automatically move a piece to the board. A simple touch screen controlled drag-and-drop interface would have vastly improved this, but ultimately the only reason people get this game is to build and set off the trap, which is underwhelming here. To top it off, the trap animation is preset, offering no physics engine. Thus it takes out the possibility of a malfunction, completely removing the all-important saving grace element of the game.   Perfection has such poor touch screen controls that the developers slowed down the timer drastically to compensate. All the adrenaline and panic is sapped from the game when each second on the timer takes a full four seconds to tick off. So instead of the over-too-quickly 60 seconds, we got a coma-inducing four minutes.   Aggravation is not only a horrible name for a game in the ~Family Game Night~ lineup, but also just a generally not fun game. What it does have is the ~take that!~ factor when you land on another player's piece and send theirs back to the starting area. The best part of the game is seeing your perfect roll come up and getting to yell, ~Hey Craig, watch this! 1..2..3..4..OH! Back to start, beeyotch!~ We tried yelling that at the DS, but it was decidedly less entertaining. Plus the pieces move automatically and make no fanfare about bumping players out.Board games are pretty cool. It's still one of the better ways to get the whole family involved in one game, and just connects people better than video games can. Also, travel board games are really handy for shutting children up on long car trips. This game pack has the benefit of being portable, but loses all the charm of the original board games. Add on that it's multicard only and the dollar to fun ratio becomes abominable. You're better off buying even just one of these games in its physical form. Everyone will have more fun with it.", "date": "Jan 23, 2008"}
