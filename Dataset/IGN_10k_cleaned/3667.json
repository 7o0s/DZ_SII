{"name": "Day of Defeat", "name_review": "Day of Defeat", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/24/day-of-defeat", "text": "It's well known that we're big fans of WWII action games, particularly those that offer lots of cool multiplayer options. It's no surprise then that we also like the game that many consider one of the first really solid titles in the genre. For those who don't know, Day of Defeat began as an enormously popular mod for the original Half-Life. All you needed was to buy a copy of Half-Life and download a rather hefty mod file to play the game. And if you like action games, odds are you've already tried the mod and fallen in love with it.   And while Activision's Day of Defeat offers loads of excitement, it does so in a slightly more focused way than titles like Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Battlefield 1942. Depending on your preferences, this tighter focus may mean either more fun narrower opportunity. If you're looking to drive planes or tanks or coordinate with players in varying roles, this isn't really your game. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a really solid tactical infantry game set in tight quarters, you'd be hard pressed to find one as good as this.   The pacing and rhythm of the game is relentless. Those of you who have played Counter-Strike will be right at home here. The intensity of the game is reinforced by the level design. Rather than featuring lots of large open areas, Day of Defeat instead relies on narrow streets and alleys to guide players towards their objectives. Various chokepoints and sniper positions make progressing from one end of the level to the other a risky prospect at best. But rather than featuring long single paths to each location, the levels in Day of Defeat almost always offer a few parallel (but equally narrow) paths to the same objective. You can maneuver around certain areas, but you're always close to the action.   The fifteen maps that ship with the game offer a range of objectives and locations. Nine territorial conquest maps task each team with capturing and defending a number of flags. Some flags require you touch them, others require you and your fellow soldiers occupy the area surrounding them. There are six timed objective-based maps as well. Here the players will need to destroy or defend large weapons, vehicles or structures. But even though you'll be taking out AA guns and storming churches the whole game has a very indoors kind of feel. Even the forest level seems like it's taking place inside. If you've ever been to a museum exhibit where they paint the walls to look like trees, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.   When joining a map, you'll first have to select a side, either Axis or Allies, and a character type. But though you'll be asked to pick a class for your character, the classes really mean nothing beyond their associated main weapon. The only difference between a rifleman and a sergeant is that one has an M1 Garand while the other has a Thompson SMG. Thinking back to titles like Battlefield and Return to Castle Wolfenstein, you'll wish that Day of Defeat offered a little more variety among the different characters.   Nevertheless, weapon selection is a big part of the game. Not only do you need to pick a weapon that works best for you, you'll also need to pick a weapon that's appropriate to the situation. Fighting house to house with a huge machine gun tends to minimize the advantages the weapon would otherwise enjoy in a large outdoor setting where fields of fire are much less limited. Conversely, weapons like submachine guns will be virtually useless as you storm up the wide open beaches at Normandy. The weapons are handled quite realistically and require differing strategies. The heavy machine guns are best fired while the bipod is deployed while the Thompson can safely be used on the run.   Actually, that's not quite correct. Day of Defeat offers a sprint option but you won't be able to shoot while sprinting. You also won't be able to fire while jumping, eliminating the aggravation of idiots constantly hopping around the map. A stamina bar keeps you from running or jumping all the time, making those mad dashes across an open square quite exhilarating.   Naturally, most of the challenge of the game is set by the players. As an online only game, you'll find yourself facing smart and skillful human opponents, some of whom have been playing the mod for years already. The barrier to entry is a bit high on this count and new players will likely find themselves poking around a corner and getting their head shot off long before they even see an enemy soldier. Don't despair. Stick with it and you'll soon discover the joy of facing some of the stiffest competition available in an online shooter. (To be sure, there are plenty of amateurs playing as well but it seems as if the overall skill level of the average Day of Defeat player is a bit higher than you'd find in similar games.)    As far as new stuff goes, the retail version of Day of Defeat is fairly light. The game also adds British troops to the mix but, as a nation, they're not as well developed as the Americans or Germans.  Instead of having the full range of class types available to the Jerrys and the Yanks, the Brits must make do with only four classes. Luckily they hit the four big categories of rifle, submachine gun, heavy machine gun and sniper rifle.   Honestly, the graphics are the weakest part of the game but they serve their purpose. The character models and environments aren't quite on par with titles like Medal of Honor but considering the age of the engine, that's to be expected. World geometry is blocky overall and the textures can sometimes seem blurry even on the highest settings. A few odd texture problems cropped up now and then and there are a few seams to be seen here and there. Worse still, some objects pop in and out. It's not completely unheard of to have bushes and even tanks disappear and reappear from time to time. But the lack of graphical beauty means that the game is sure to run well even on older systems. We've found the game performs well at both the high and low ends of the spectrum.   Like Tribes or Quake the game takes shape according to the rules chosen by the servers. Consequently you'll rarely see servers running with options like friendly fire enabled. While the lack of friendly fire makes things less frustrating, it also tends to dumb down the action a bit. I'm not happy when idiots on my own team shoot me in the back but I feel like I'm cheating a bit when I shoot through groups of my own guys to take out enemies.   What did you think of Day of Defeat?   Also on the server culpa front, I think the map cycles are far too long. I prefer to run through one level two or three times and then move on to a new level. It seems like most Day of Defeat servers run the same map over and over again. While it does give you a chance to learn each map intimately, I found myself getting bored more than better.Assuming you already have Half-Life and a decent internet connection I'd suggest downloading the free mod and trying it out first. Still for those players who don't own Half-Life, the retail version of Day of Defeat is priced to move. For thirty bucks you get the full game along with the accompanying documentation. The challenge level is undoubtedly high on most of the servers but if you stick with it long enough you'll find that the rewards for successful play are proportionate to the difficulties you'll face. The sense of satisfaction you feel in taking a crucial victory location or taking out four enemies in a row simply can't be beat.Ultimately, I'll still stick with Battlefield 1942 for the wider options it affords in terms of character classes and vehicles as well as the more fluid nature of the battle afforded by the larger, more open maps. But anytime I grow weary of waiting for a plane to spawn or start feeling frustrated by the lulls in the action, Day of Defeat is right there to provide an instant and amazingly intense action fix.", "date": "May 24, 2003"}
