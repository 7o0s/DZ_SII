Like Madden 64, FIFA Soccer: Road to World Cup 98 is a solid game. Unfortunately, there are a few problems that keep the game from being in the same league as Konami's International Superstar Soccer 64, but the overall impression I got from the game is a positive one.GameplayEven after only a few minutes of playtime it becomes clear that apart from the license, FIFA 98 and FIFA 64 have almost nothing in common. EA seems to have learned its lesson and made use of some of the N64's unique features instead of treating the N64 the same way as PCs or the PSX. First of all, the game control is analog. If you push your control stick only slightly, your player will walk with the ball, push it all the way and he will run. Like in ISS64, your primary pass and shoot functions are assigned to the A and B buttons, with turbo, high-pass, through pass and tackle options on the C-Buttons and some innovative dribbling on Z and R. Another nice novelty is the 3D arrow system, that lets you determine the exact height, force and curve of the ball when executing a kick-off or corner ball.The default gameplay in FIFA 98 is slower than ISS64's, and the view is farther zoomed out without a radar display (you can switch one on in the options, but the zoomed-out view lets you see plenty). Even though it doesn't have some of ISS64's sim-features (for example, FIFA lacks ISS64's in-game strategy changes), it feels more like a sim. It's still fun to play even for non-sim fans -- and despite its more ~floaty~ player control FIFA '98 manages to be one of the better soccer games on the market. It's especially in direct comparison with Konami's game that it becomes readily apparent that the gameplay could have been so much more. Lack of speed and fluid motion, and the much slower response time of the FIFA 98 players are only one side of the problem. Compared to ISS64, FIFA also lacks the in-game strategy calls, fluid dribble control, and cool 1-2 and thru-pass options, and suffers from some annoying AI problems in the one-player mode.FeaturesThis is where FIFA '98 excels. Although ISS64 had a mock ~World Cup~ mode, nothing comes close to playing the actual teams with the actual players. According to EA, FIFA '98 features 6,400 soccer players from over 360 international soccer teams and 172 national ones. You can pick any team from the CONCACAF, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, AFC, UEFA, and most major soccer nations, such as Brazil, Germany, Italy, and yes, even the USA. FIFA '98 lets you play either the World Cup match (with an emphasis on the qualification rounds), a friendly match with any team, or the League Mode. You can also adjust your team's attributes (more aggressive, etc) and formation and call player changes any time.In addition to an up-to-date roster of all players, you can also modify teams, change the colors of the uniforms, initiate player transfers, and even create a new player using different faces, hair styles, and skin tones. Stats tracking is basic, and a little more detail would have been appreciated -- but it's accurate and functional. Like in every other soccer game out there, FIFA '98 also features a training mode.AIIf you primarily buy a game to play it alone against the computer, AI (artificial intelligence) is one of the most important things in a game. Unfortunately, FIFA '98's AI is rather spotty. I had no problem selecting one of the average teams and marching right through to the World Cup Finals. On the way, Germany (in one of the computer vs. computer simulated matches) was beaten 5:1 by N. Ireland -- hey, that does NOT happen! :)  eliminating any chance of a showdown between me and my hometeam. Well, I won't hold that against FIFA '98, even though it kicks out good old Deutschland almost every time. Anyway, I marched right through to the finals scoring as many as 10 goals in only two minutes against the weaker teams, and braving even Brazil and France by beating them 4:0 and 5:0 respectively. It wasn't until the WC final that Italy put up quite a fight, giving me the soccer experience I was looking for. I won 3:2 in a four minute game.There are definite holes in the AI. EA seems to think that a weaker team is characterized by its uncanny ability to always play the ball forward to the opponent's goalie when kicking off from the midfield (even though there are no allied players there). On top of that, the computer kicks the ball out if it's close to the line instead of saving it, and the goalie AI is simply ridiculous at times (the guy comes out for no reason, and even runs past the ball). Or how about this: The computer players sometimes ~harass~ and run circles around your goalie when he's about to kick off, making it impossible to clear the ball. If you wait and don't kick in the hope that the computer will eventually give up, the referee will call on your delay, resulting in a penalty kick. Ahem. The overall slower pace of the game could have worked nicely together with a smart AI, where the opposing team builds up its offense, makes smart passes and then attacks. As it is, FIFA '98 will often make you roll your eyes at the computer for missing a chance, running past a ball, or letting the wimpiest shots score. Thankfully, it's not all that bad. Some teams do come across as more accurate (the quick passes of the stronger teams can be very impressive), and with two or more players, it's of course a different story.Multiplayer: Because of FIFA's zoomed-out camera perspective, it's a lot easier to play the game with four players than it is in ISS64. The view, coupled with the slower pace here actually helps build up an offense and makes passing a joy. Thankfully, EA also included four different colored targets to let players know who they are controlling (hear that, ISS?).GraphicsSoccer never looked better. FIFA '98 is the first game to use the N64's built-in medium-resolution mode. It's not quite as sharp as Quarterback Club's hi-res, but it definitely looks a lot better than ISS64. That is, until it moves. Unfortunately, the complex graphics come at a price: framerate. Depending on the number of players on screen (and the conditions), the framerate drops to an annoying stutter. It's nowhere near as bad as in FIFA 64, but it makes it hard to follow the ball in crowded situations and virtually destroys the fluid animation of the players. Speaking of which, the redone player models are really nice (if you can ignore the strange hair textures that make all the black guys look like they have gray hair) and animate smoothly. Injured players even limp! The victory celebrations are also very nice, as are some of the antics of the goalkeeper and the referees. I suggest checking out the animation in a one on one practice match. If only the real game ran as smoothly.The international stadiums look fantastic, and there are far more of them here than in ISS64. You can also select different weather conditions (hot, normal, rain, sleet, snow, etc), switch between day and night, and even play a 5-on-5 match of indoors soccer. The rain and snow effects are not much to shout about, and the absence of crowd animation hurts, but the real-time shadows on a sunny day and the player reflections in an indoors match are as good as they get. The front-end, the menus and stats screens are well-designed and more pleasing to the eye than ISS64's clunky look. Overall, FIFA 98s graphics would be a high-point for a console sports game, if only EA had managed to get the 3D engine to run smoothly. Soccer is a fast game that needs quick responses. Please, EA, next time start with the framerate -- if it's not up to par, cut down on player and field detail.SoundAgain, FIFA 98 beats ISS64 hands down  and this time there is no catch. FIFA 98 is in Dolby Surround sound, with diverse stadium chants, excellent sound effects, and clear voice narration by John Motson and Andy ~that's what made it even more impressive~ Gray. As a bonus, you are even greeted by a ~woohoo~ surprise when you start the game, courtesy of Blur. I prefer FIFA 98's sparse narration over ISS64's ~Wales! Intercept the ball, Brazil! Thwarted again, midfielder, passes it on, pass, goalkeeper, that shot was a little wild!~ Although I do have to say that scoring in FIFA 98 isn't quite as fun compared with ISS64's ecstatic ~GOOOOOAAAAAAL!!!~AccessoriesThe Rumble Pak is not supported. Data (progress in World Cup mode, created teams, players) can be saved to an optional memory card. If you thought ISS64 was a memory hog, check this out: FIFA '98 needs 123 free pages (one whole pak) before it saves as much as a player's right sock. Grrrrr, EA!FIFA 98 is a good soccer game with three unfortunate problems: Shoddy framerate, some AI glitches, and Konami's ISS64. The awesome sound, multiplayer gameplay, and FIFA license make FIFA 98 a good buy for soccer enthusiasts -- but only if they already own ISS64. Others, especially sticklers for a steady framerate and fast-paced sports will definitely want to rent it first. But what ever you do, hook it up to a surround sound system and remind your three best buddies to stop by with their controllers.", "date": "Dec 25, 1997"}
