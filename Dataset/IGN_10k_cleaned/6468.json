Originally released way back in 1982 by Williams Electronics, Robotron is just as addictive now as it was back then. That is, of course, if you have the tolerance to put up with endless waves of pixilated, robotic enemies. For those who were hooked or still are hooked on the original, you'll find a few new features expand your gameplay options.   A game of Robotron starts you at the center of a rectangular map that's populated with enemies. In order to survive and get to the next map you need to kill all the enemies. To do this, you'll need to manipulate both of the joysticks on your controller. The left stick moves and the right stick shoots, and that's pretty much it. Sounds simple, right? Well, after playing for thirty seconds you'll quickly discover this game is much more complicated if you want to survive.    As you progress from map to map, you'll face off against harder and harder enemies. You'll battle the simple GRUNT robots and indestructible Hulks in the first levels, but the challenge quickly ramps up when you start dealing with large groups of pesky Sphereoids and the Brains' frustratingly erratic missiles. You'll also be able to save civilians for bonus points, which you'll definitely want to do before the Brains turn them against you. Over time, the ridiculously fast-paced twitch appeal of Robotron hasn't diminished at all.   The game supports play over Xbox Live and lets you engage in cooperative and also ranked and unranked versus matches. In cooperative mode, which can be played on or offline, one player controls character movement and the other one controls firing and it alternates every level. In versus mode, players compete with each other to get the highest score as quickly as possible before one of them dies. You'll also be able to do ranked versus matches where you square off against players with skill levels similar to yours. If you want, you can create a private match where you can alter how many lives you start with, when you get a bonus life, and the game difficulty.   To keep track of how you're doing against the community you'll be able to view a online leader board that tracks everyone's high scores. There are a total of 12 achievements to be attained in the game as well, most of which just involve completing waves. You'll also find a new background to look at while you're pulverizing pixels. For so simple a game, there's plenty to do.For all the Robotron fans out there, this is a great pickup with the added online features. If you were obsessed with the original, you'll be just as obsessed with this one, though playing with controller sticks isn't quite the same as using the arcade joysticks.", "date": "Dec 3, 2005"}
