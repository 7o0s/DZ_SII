The second chapter in Peter Jackson's trilogy of The Lord of the Rings films was an epic, action-packed, character-driven masterpiece that knocked filmgoers on their collective fannies.  And so did Electronic Arts' PlayStation 2, XBox, and GameCube games--which sold in the millions.  But that was a strict action game... what about something that requires as much thinking as the books did?  Features: 6 battle maps Control Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and Theoden Battle orcs, wargs, and Uruk-hai Save game feature Recover health and defensive items  The The Lord of the Rings property has just been begging for a good strategy game.  JAMDAT's Two Towers delivers.  From the battlefields of Rohan to the Gates of Helm's Deep, you must fend off waves of assaulting orcs and Saruman's venomously evil Uruk-hai.  But you must use your brain as well as your blade, for the battlefields are wide, supplies are limited, and the enemy is sometimes craftier than you would expect.  This strategy game is broken into two turns: movement and action.  Each of the four characters has a different range of movement--Legolas can move much further and swifter than stumpy Gimli.  As you survey the battlefield, keep an eye out for terrain changes that you can use to your advantage, such as thickets that increase your defensive capabilities or rock outcroppings that might help you get the drop on a lowly warg.  Once you're in position, unleash an attack.  Aragorn and Gimli use their swords and axes to deliver devastating melee blows in close combat, while Legolas has ranged weapons, such as arrows, that he can fire from afar.  Use your terrain to get the most out of Legolas' ranged attacks.  Theoden is the weakest and most battle-weary of the bunch, so it is often helpful to keep him close to other warriors. Surrounding an enemy with a few party members will increase the amount of damage you can do.  Fallen foes will sometimes leave items behind, like potatoes and potions, that replenish your health.  Do not use these items carelessly, as they are not plentiful.  There are chests on the field that also contain health items, but making a break for them can leave a character vulnerable to attack.  Try plowing through the first few rounds without using many taters.  Since you really only need one party member alive and kicking to finish a round, it is acceptable to take losses.  Especially when that loss is Theoden.  Characters also have special skills that are useful in battle.  Theoden has a rallying skill that bumps up the level of damage your party will dish out during the next turn.  Gimli has a berserker attack that does extra damage to a nearby orc.  Legolas and Aragorn can use their skills to switch weapons.  Learn when it is best to use these skills.  Use Theoden's rally cry when all characters are near targets to maximize it's effectiveness.  Switch Legolas' weapon to bow and arrow when new enemies enter the battlefield just out of a melee attack's reach.  And Gimli's supe-attack is best used on a particularly strong foe that could deal serious damage if left alive for too many turns.  Two Towers plays surprisingly well for a pint-sized strategy game.  You would expect a fairly shallow affair from a cellphone thinker like this, but that kind of thinking will get you killed rather fast on the fields of Rohan.  Trial and error will teach you the attack patterns of wargs and Uruk-hai, so you can anticipate their next moves.  And while it may seem at first that the game is hopelessly stacked against you, the tide turns as you gain more experience.  By the time you've reached Helm's Deep, Aragorn is a badass able to level Uruk-hai with minimal effort.  The top down maps are not terrible exciting to look at, with more than enough earthtones for three games.  The mini-sprites used to represent your party and enemies are decent enough that you can tell Gimli from Legolas.  Once you enter battle, the game offers up a slight cutscene with minimal animation.  An arm goes out for an attack, and if it connects, you see a little comic book-like star.  The movie may have employed an epic, sweeping soundtrack, but this little game falls silent.  It's too bad, as some good swashbuckling samples or battle cries would have really helped pump Two Towers up.Two Towers is a solid strategy title for gamers looking for something beyond simple shooters and platformers.  Like a good RPG, it requires some thinking and item management, which you might not expect from such a small package.  Visuals are a little lacking, especially considering some of the stuff JAMDAT competitor Gameloft is doing, but they get the job done and don;t take up that big of a footprint on your phone's memory.", "date": "May 21, 2003"}
