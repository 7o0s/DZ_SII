Apple's media player is a surprisingly good destination for the puzzler, as the deficiencies of the click-wheel as a game controller are a non-issue in these brain exercise lightning rounds. Just light taps and simple spins are all you need to solve the twenty different puzzle events, so the only mental struggle is discerning the right answer, not how to control the game.   The twenty events in Brain Challenge are spread across five categories: Math, Memory, Logic, and Focus, Visual. Each category has five events, such as the Trout Route math contest that tasks you with following a pattern that snakes through a field of numbers or the visual contest Ascending, where you must chart out the lowest to highest of four groups of objects. In hard mode, when these objects start to intermingle, this brain teaser becomes a real challenge. There's another real teaser in the mirror minigame, where you must imagine what a shape looks like when reflected. At first, it's a breeze, but when you have to start flopping complex shapes across diagonals, it turns devilish.   The Magic Rule game tasks you with applying math rules and orientation rules to a series of patterns -- this one can get tricky when you have to apply both at the same time. (Example: Everything is +2, but also flips direction or changes color.) The Mosaic game asks you to correctly place tile sets to form a specific shape. The Flickering event flashes a number sequence at you and you must find the match -- but as it gets harder, it starts flashing the numbers at different points in the sequence. Maybe it starts in the middle? And then there's following the path of a frog... it goes on and on.   Much like Nintendo's Brain Age, the game that really popularized this genre (but did not found it, mind you), you always start the game by running through a quick test. You play through five randomly selected challenges to measure the way your head handles each category. You are sometimes hit with new games during the exam -- maybe you haven't seen the shape-counting Hocus Pocus game yet, but now you must go into blind. It's tricky, but you get some instructions first. At the end of the test, your brain is assigned a percentage point -- but don't worry, this is not scientific. (However, if you only use six-percent of your noggin, I suspect you have a decent number of Fergie songs on your iPod.) From there, you practice with the different tests, unlocking new ones as you play. Every day you play, you're supposed to try another brain exam to see if you're improving.   It's interesting to look at the progress charts. Math is not my bag and I really only saw minimal improvement. However, I aced the logic and focus categories and hovering close tot he top the whole time. It's intriguing to check in on how you think. If you're good at logic, chances are you will be exceptional at all of the logic categories. With math, it really was hit or miss. The Trout Route event worked for me, but when equations are thrown at me every second, I start to get tripped up.   In addition to the brain training events, Brain Challenge offers a selection of creativity events that aren't tied to the brain test portion of the game. The first one I unlocked was Magic Circle, which lets you bounce little balls off the inside of a rotating circle. Each bounce strikes a note. You spin the central cannon (it's an Electroplankton refugee) with the wheel and just blast out a random little melody. Very soothing.   Brain Challenge certainly looks better on the iPod than on mobile -- but then again, the fifth-generation iPod does have a nicer screen than most handsets and it's classic, landscape orientation is useful. But beyond just resolution, Gameloft has done a great job amp'ing the game up for the iPod. The animations are great, the extra games are cool to see, and the music is especially good. This is one of those rare iPod games that will make you consider not using your own library as a soundtrack.   Now, I've noticed that a few people on Apple forums have complained that the game freezes up on their iPod. This did indeed happen to me once, too. However, there are other people without any worries whatsoever. This lone crash didn't bother me, though, as I've had a couple iPods hang up just while playing music.Brain Challenge is a great mobile and it's an excellent fit for the iPod. The click-wheel is a fine control input for selecting the answers in this series of brain teasers, never getting in the way like it can on some slightly more ~hardcore~ games. The exercises are uniformly fun and engaging. The game looks fantastic on the iPod's sharp screen. Only somebody that is somehow wholly down on brain training games will not enjoy Brain Challenge, and that's likely the kind of person that needs their brain checked in the first place.", "date": "Dec 18, 2007"}
