{"name": "Paris Hilton Diamond Quest", "name_review": "Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/11/paris-hiltons-diamond-quest", "text": "Anybody that derided the seeming inessential nature of a mobile game with the hotel heiress Paris Holton's rubber stamp -- which included me -- was silenced at this year's E3 in Los Angeles. Ms. Hilton caused a massive West Hall traffic jam and major outlets picked up the story of her possible game name snafu -- to the exclusion of reports in the PlayStation 3 and other bombshell vid game announcements. So, whatever Gameloft paid for Hilton's likeness was obviously money well-spent... PR-wise.   Whether having Ms. Hilton on-screen affects the game play in any way, however, is another story entirely. Unless you are a vehement opponent to her very existence, she certainly doesn't distract with the puzzle proceedings. She lingers on the top of the screen, wearing that same, singular smile she trots out at every club openings or celebrity party chronicled on E! on cable TV. The game offers several pictures of the woman, including a special shot of her dog, Tinkerbell, for players to uncover as they work through a series of puzzles.   At first glance, Diamond Quest will remind you of Bejeweled. At second, it seems like a hybrid of Bejeweled and I-play's Jewel Quest -- especially in Flip Mania mode, where you have to remove jewels while lighting up squares on the grid behind them. Diamond Quest offers a handful of play modes, such as Reveal Letters, in which you uncover the letters of Paris' name to earn cash. Puzzle mode is a little more insidious, as you can only clear the screen with one series of moves. Gem Collector challenges you to clear away a specific number of certain gems, like emerald cubes and pink hearts.   With all of these modes, Diamond Quest appears to offer quite a bit of value for the download. But the game doesn't really advance the ball, so to speak. None of these modes offer anything particularly original -- which is kinda strange from a Gameloft game. Perhaps if you haven't downloaded either Bejeweled or Jewel Quest yet, Diamond Quest might not be a bad purchase, but there isn't much reason to add this to a collection that includes those previous titles.  Now, let's be honest -- Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest is going to sell a lot of download based strictly on name recognition -- and on those grounds, you can see exactly why Gameloft licensed Ms. Hilton's name and likeness. Her fans will likely enjoy her ever-present visage and special photos. And at least those that do download are getting a decent puzzler for their money. But with better puzzlers on the decks right now -- Gunpey EX, Jewel Quest, Diner Dash, etc. -- I really can only recommend Diamond Quest for those that enjoy following Hilton's exploits on basic cable and the tabloids.", "date": "Jul 11, 2006"}
