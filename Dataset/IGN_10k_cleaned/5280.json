However, the Hawaii-based developer has plenty of other brainteasers in its catalog, such as Blue Blocks. The game is a variation on the ~clear the screen~ theme -- its simplicity will rope you in and its addictiveness will keep you subscribed month after month.   At the onset of Blue Blocks, the screen is filled with blue, red, and green blocks. If two or more of a like color are beside each other, you can wipe them off the screen with a simple click. The greater number of blocks, the more money you earn for clearing the group. With each grouping eradicated, the blocks above it fall into their place and if there is a blank column, the blocks move to the left side of the screen.   Your strategy is simple. Try to clear blocks to make larger groupings. This is not easy, especially when the game throws in a fourth color: yellow. There are ~power-ups~ that help you clear the screen and add to your cashpile, such as ~Bomb Blocks~ that crater out the blocks around them. These are especially useful because for every single block left over at the end of each round, you lose a point from your health meter.  Blue Blocks is one of those awesome puzzle games with an unsuspecting title that siphons your free time with abandon. I have loved almost every Blue Lava puzzler I've downloaded -- especially Blue Babel -- and Blue Blocks does not disappoint. Step back from the big name-brand franchises for a moment and indulge yourself with a fun little puzzler that deserves your attention and dollars.", "date": "Nov 15, 2004"}
