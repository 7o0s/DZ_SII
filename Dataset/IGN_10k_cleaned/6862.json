Released back in 1999 for the N64 and then again in 2001 for the PlayStation 2, the Winback franchise has had quite a bit of time to cultivate and grow into something new and interesting. It'll be disappointing for fans with fleeting fond memories of the original to hear that Winback 2: Project Poseidon fails to escape from the confines of mediocrity.   Winback 2 puts you in control of a three-person anti-terrorist squad comprised of agents Craig Contrell, Nick Bruno and Mia Cabrera. The game is divided into episodes, each of which is comprised a few missions, some of which are broken into several sub-missions. Each individual mission is broken into two parts, called Stages A and B, and occasionally includes a third boss stage. Each mission involves two agents who journey through different parts of the same map. Their respective journeys are separated between Stages A and B. Through each Stage, whichever agent you're controlling needs to perform actions that help out the other agent. This often involves unlocking doors, deactivating security grids, wiping out enemies, or restoring power.   Faceplant! Though the team dynamic could have had some interesting applications, it winds up getting repetitive quickly. Mainly, this is because there's little variation in the results of your actions.  Timers frequently pop up indicating you've got a limited window for performing an action, let's say reaching a console to unlock a door. Assuming the clock had a total of 30 seconds on it and you manage to unlock the door in 20, you'll get a message that you completed it ~fast.~ However, if you take too long, you get hit with a ~slow~ rating and lose pieces of your power bar.   The problem is, regardless of what kind of speed you complete the mini-challenge in, it doesn't affect the second squadmate's progression at all. When the Stage A person has to complete an unlock or power down or assist and takes too long, Stage B is unaffected. This really narrows the gameplay. Instead of actually worrying about how easy or hard you'll make Stage B through your performance in Stage A, you instead just need to focus solely on completing the objectives presented. You'll hear a character in Stage B complain about how the Stage A act took too long, but aside from that there's nothing different.   It sounds good. But it's not. Without any kind of real team dynamics outside of simple door unlocks and kill assists, where does that leave Winback 2? It basically turns into an arcade-like third person shooter with light stealth elements. Each bland stage is comprised of a number of rooms and simple corridors you can see on your map. They usually don't take too long to get through. Generally, two or three enemies will be thrown at you when you enter a new area, and you'll have opportunities to take cover behind crates or walls.   From cover, you can poke your head around and shoot and lob grenades or flashbangs. Should you decide to ~unattach~ from a wall, you can also target enemies out of cover, which is often just as effective, since the enemy A.I. is so bad. Each enemy in the game has a definite pattern. If they've got a pistol, they shoot three or four times, then reload, then repeat. SMG opponents loose a quick burst, reload, and repeat. It's the same thing with rocket launcher baddies and shotgun-wielding guards. Occasionally they'll interrupt their firing patterns to duck if you pop out, but within seconds they'll return to their original positions. Provided they're the only enemy left, you can actually just remain out of cover with your reticule aimed at where they used to be and pop them when they return.     Hitting an enemy in the head with bullets kills them outright. Two shots to any other part of their body ~arrests~ them, meaning they go to their knees, put their hands behind their head, flicker and disappear. If you're close enough, it's far and away more effective to use the game's melee attack. By tapping a single button at close range, you'll either faceplant, knee or push over the enemy, killing them and causing their weapon to drop. Since enemy firing patterns are so obvious, it's very possible to take out almost every enemy in a stage by running and faceplanting them when they stop to reload. This remains a viable strategy even against enemies that appear later on in the game.   The fact that you can practically wipe out stages by faceplanting enemies further diminishes any kind of strategy present in Winback 2' s gameplay. Also, most enemies always know you're present, so there's little to no stealth elements at all in the game. With little team strategy, virtually no stealth elements, and predictable enemy A.I., what does Winback 2 have left to offer? Outside of simplistic third-person shooting from cover positions, not much. Any enjoyment you'd get out of the mindless gunfights would dissipate after an hour or less, once you realize almost every level presents the same set of challenges.   You'd think this would matter. Winback 2's story does little to offset the gameplay deficiencies. Each Episode moves you against a main foe who you battle at the end of the last mission. You'll frequently need to interrogate foes (not shoot them in the face), interrogate innocents (walk up to them), and find valuable information (walk into a room and find a rotating yellow icon). This pushes forward a wholly generic storyline about taking down terrorist kingpins, which isn't helped by its awful voice acting. Better described as hilariously bad, you'll find yourself laughing at many plot points and setups, simply because of each character's inane expressions. Also, the enemies' shouts get gratingly repetitive. They have an extremely small pool of voice quips, including, ~pig,~ ~you bastard,~ and several vocalized wishes for your death. To round out Winback 2's dreary soundscape, the gun effects are weak, and the music sounds out of place to a distracting degree. Who listens to jazz-rock while killing terrorists?    Graphics fare no better. Textures vary little from Episode to Episode. Stage geometry is rudimentary, usually consisting of small, square rooms and empty rectangular corridors with little to no environmental detail outside of a few boxes. Your controllable characters animate like gravity didn't affect them, floating around with a laughably artificial stride. Also, they can't seem to stop smiling for some reason. Enemy designs are boring as well, though this is offset by some bizarre designs, specifically The Bomb boss. Let the enemy reactions to your bullet barrages not be overlooked, however, as they're surprisingly realistic. It's nothing that saves the game, however.   The best next step? Melee attack. Outside of the story mode, the game's got some offline multiplayer modes. Though there are a few different modes, they're all basically deathmatch with different weapons. As you beat up bosses they become available as selectable characters, which might be a cool feature if this mode was worth playing. However, it's not. You can add up to three bots, but their behavior involves basically running erratically around stages, choosing to fire at seemingly random times. With human opponents, it's not much better.For those who fondly remember the original, Project Poseidon will be like washing your mouth with acid should you decide to play it. The game fails to generate any interesting gameplay with its shallow team dynamic and adds little else to keep players interested. At its core, Winback 2 is a simplistic third person action game with rudimentary duck and cover elements. Its offline multiplayer mode does nothing to help its otherwise lackluster story, characters, voice acting, enemy A.I., and graphics. Expect to spend an hour or less with this one before growing bored. Pick up Winback 2 only if you're a glutton for mediocrity.", "date": "Apr 25, 2006"}
