Nintendo stated at E3 2006 that we'd see as many as 100 new DS titles before the end of the year, and that means a ton of product out on the shelves for consumers.  THQ, known for its close ties with virtually every children's franchise out there, is again flexing its corporate muscle with Nicktoons Unite, featuring four of the best-selling Nickelodeon franchises together in one package.  When the forces of evil team up to take over the world, SpongeBob, Jimmy Neutron, Danny Phantom and Timmy Turner answer the call.  Though Nicktoons Unite offers the top toons together for the first time, the package still falls a bit short in a few key areas.  Team that with the fact that every franchise in Nicktoons unite (aside from Jimmy Neutron) already has an exclusive title on DS, and you've got a product that isn't a failure, but also isn't really needed.   At its most basic level, Nicktoons Unite is a 3D platformer much like the majority of Nickelodeon titles before it.  Players run, jump and perform character-specific actions as they explore levels inspired by the multiple brands.  Separating Nicktoons Unite from the pack, players can swap between the four heroes at any time with the touch screen in an instantaneous ~tag-in~ fashion.  Each character also has unique abilities that make them vital to the team, so using the four characters in tandem proves to be a necessary technique.  In addition, Jimmy Neutron, Danny Phantom, SpongeBob and Timmy each have their own health meter, and thus need to be managed as separate characters.  If a single member of the team falls, everyone does, so learning to switch characters in and out based on the situation is essential.   Character swapping isn't just the game's hook though, as it affects every aspect of gameplay.  Since each of the Nicktoons are accessible at any time, their abilities are entirely unique, and swapping team members happens a ton during exploration.  In a few moments of gameplay (especially in the later levels) players will have to use Danny Phantom to wall-jump over a barrier, switch to Jimmy Neutron to double jump over a large gap, dash between traps with Timmy Turner and parachute into a new area with SpongeBob's underwear parachute.  Granted, character-swapping isn't a new concept, but the level design manages to separate each member into an equally important part of the team, ensuring that each hero gets their moment in the spotlight.    In fact, if it weren't for the sketchy gameplay issues Nicktoons Unite would be an amazingly well-rounded adventure.  A few problems arise very early in the game, however, and the unreliable general control ends up bogging down the overall product.  For starters, Nicktoons Unite is presented as a 3D platformer that uses a D-pad as the primary control.  Though other DS games manage to perform just fine without an analog stick (Mario 64 DS and Pac Man World 3 come to mind), Nicktoons just doesn't control tight enough.  Running at angles and making quick turns is often very difficult, and players will find themselves trying to feather the control to simulate lighter turns or to set up key jumps.  Adding to the madness, the camera control is downright horrid.  The majority of the control is automated, though an option to manually turn left or right is available by use of the L and R buttons.  This has no bearing for height however, and the camera runs into inexcusable issues when backed into corners or along walls.  Rather than taking an overhead angle or swiveling around the character the camera actually stops in the corner, obstructing view of the playfield with the character itself.  Since the game's levels are laid out in a room-to-room design, players are always near barriers of some kind, making the camera issues that much more apparent.     When it comes to adding depth to the adventure, Nicktoons Unite again fails to deliver as much as expected.  The game is very short, spanning only 16 levels (themed from the four franchises) and a few mini-games.  Most of the levels consist of either random item-hunting or enemy elimination, with a few (basic) boss fights and stealth missions thrown in to keep things interesting.  In the end, however, each level is basically the same.  Players run from room to room collecting items or killing baddies, switching from one hero to the next in search for the next room, where they'll again collect items and kill baddies.  The mini-games are slotted between levels to keep the gameplay from being mundane, though they're amazingly simplistic.  Aside from tapping icons and dragging objects with the touch screen there's really nothing new, and instead of adding variety the mini-games are more of a distraction.  In fact, failing a mini-game means watching the preceding storyboard ~skit~ over again with no ability to skip it, which only adds to the pain of defeat.   Driving the final nail into the coffin, Nicktoons Unite is underwhelming in the graphical and audio department as well, something that Nickelodeon franchises should be able to capitalize on.  The character models and animation are pretty solid, though the environments that make up the 16 levels are a bit on the bland side.  Many of the effects used for special moves or enemy attacks seem like a very freshman effort as well, under par for the usual style we expect from licensed content.  Adding to the abnormally simplistic production, none of the actual audio was used from any of the shows.  No character voice-overs are used either, which is simply baffling when considering the sheer amount of videogame time these characters have had.  On a similar note, it's bizarre to run through Bikini bottom without hearing the all-too familiar 'Who lives in a pineapple under the sea!' theme song.  What gives?  Team that with very simple storyboards, a lack of in-game instruction for players and a dry list of extras and you've got what seems to be a rushed effort meant to play second chair to the console versions.    When it comes to licensed games, theres no reason to accept a sub-par product.  THQ and Nickelodeon have put nearly 30 titles on the shelves using just the four licenses in Nicktoons Unite, and thats counting only GBA and DS thus far.  If you want an awesome childrens title, theyre out there, and theres certainly more to come as well.  Nicktoons Unite combines four of the top brands on the Nick roster, but loses a ton of the focus while doing so.  The presentation is average at best, each characters abilities are scaled down to make room for the entire team, and the gameplay takes a hit when compared to previous products.  The product isnt necessarily bad, its just been done far better in previous games, and is an obvious accompaniment to the larger budgeted console versions.", "date": "Jul 6, 2006"}
