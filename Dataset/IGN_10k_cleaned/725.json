While none of the aforementioned titles are A+ quality games, each and every one of them had something special about it that made it a first-rate videogame title.   It seemed that each of this year's different hoops titles had something that it did really well, only to have a weak link in its game take it down a notch. NBA Live 2000 did a lot of things right but was held back by its horrid, mind-destroying frame rate. March Madness 2000 raised the bar in so many areas with its wealth of options and wonderful music, but lost points in the end because of its lousy AI. ShootOut 2000's shot meter is the best gameplay feature in videogame basketball, but the game lacked the realism needed in a sports simulation. And, Fox Sports' NBA Basketball 2000 had tremendous player animation and superb visuals, but didn't follow through with authentic gameplay.   Oddly enough, if one were to take the best features of each of this year's batch of titles and meld them all together, you'd probably end up with a perfect basketball game. I'd go into that a little deeper, but we'll leave that for a special feature we're planning for the near future.   Then comes Konami's latest effort in the basketball arena, NBA In The Zone 2000.   Gameplay As hard as I tried, and I really did try, I couldn't find a single ingredient in NBA In The Zone 2000 that would make it into the perfect basketball game discussed a few paragraphs above. The game features full statistical tracking, league leaders, create a player, trades, solid player management options, the full NBA team and player license and all of the staple features of professional sports games.   But, guess what? Those are no longer features that make a sports game good. They're now must-have components of sports videogames that are only notable when not part of the game. I hate to use a football analogy in a basketball game review, but think of the stats, player management, and play option features as the offensive line. An offensive lineman is as important as any other player on the field is, but in most cases, he'll only get noticed when he screws up.    The gameplay is abysmal to say the least. Players do have the ability to use either the digital pad or the analog control stick, but it doesn't really make any difference. Some may find it easier to use the analog stick, but there's no real advantage to using it.   Given the fact that there are so many different basketball games on the market and they've been made pretty much each and every year for the past decade, you'd think that companies could learn from all the different games. It seems like common sense that when developing a basketball game the producers would look at all the previously released titles and include all of the good options that have become staples in some of them. Apparently, Konami isn't doing this.   While the ability to back in to an opponent has been in the Live series for what seems like an eternity, the developers of In The Zone 2000 didn't think that their game needed it. Instead, players only have a very limited number of moves at their disposal. In addition to the basics like pass, shoot, jump, steal, and speed burst, players can press the triangle button to do a special move. What's the special move? Well, it's completely up to the computer and it sometimes involves your player doing a spin move straight out of bounds. If you want to do some posting up with your big men on the inside, you can't.   The onscreen players do have a wide array of special moves or scoring moves that you'll see during the course of the game, but the game player doesn't really have any control over them. As said above, pressing the triangle button may cause the normally sound Vince Carter, do a wicked spin move that can take him straight out of bounds.   Where this problem really stands out the most when you attempt to shoot the ball. The game moves at a respectable pace when dribbling up court, but once the player is ready to shoot and presses the square button, everything slows down and the player begins some sort of shot animation. Depending on where you're at, what players are around you, and what direction you're pressing, the player will go into a snail-paced animation that is so slow that you can go smash your head into the wall (punishing yourself for playing this much of the game) during the shot and still get back in time for the rebound.   Additionally, the players will often do moves and perform actions that you don't really want them to do. You can be facing the basket and looking to do a simple jump shot and the player will awkwardly go into some strange hook shot animation that really wasn't needed. There were times that my player would be driving to the hoop and I would press the square button to try and do a simple lay-up only to have the player stop in his tracks and go into a hook shot animation that had him going away from the basket.   If that's not enough torture for you, In The Zone 2000 also has some screwed up collision issues. When players are driving the lane and a defender partially gets in his way, instead of being knocked slightly to the side or knocking over the defender, the player making the drive will be knocked clumsily backwards. In all my years of watching NBA basketball on TV I've never once seen someone as big as Shaq driving the lane only to get knocked five feet backwards because a small six foot tall point guard got slightly in his way. It happens quite often in this game.   Graphics Graphically, there isn't much good to be said about In the Zone 2000, either. On the plus side, the court does look good and there's some nice reflections of crowd that you'll notice when you player with one of the closer camera angles, but that's about it.   The framerate isn't as bad as Live 2000, but the movement of the players is extremely jerky. There are some really nice dunk or passing animations, but game seems to slow down greatly when any of those good animations are being performed. In regular non-shooting gameplay, the characters seem to lack transition animation frames.   The player models are also pretty bad and the differences in player heights and body sizes aren't really that noticeable. Honestly, there aren't really any PlayStation games that does accomplish this effectively, so I'm not complaining about this too much.   Sound The audio department is the only area in this game that doesn't reek of monkey piss. However, it's still not that good. The crowd noise features a wide range of ambient sounds like claps, screams, chirps, and rumbling and the stadium announcer occasionally chimes in at big moments, but there's nothing memorable about the game's audio. Plus, there isn't any play-by-play announcing. Sure, the play-by-play in most games needs improvement, but removing it completely isn't the way to do it.  I've already said pretty much everything that I want to about this game. NBA In The Zone 2000 is a pile of crap. Not the kind that you or I would leave in the toilet after a night of eating nothing but refried beans at Chevy's, but much worse than that. It's one of those big piles that you'll find wandering through those cow pastures on some Friday night when you have nothing better to do than go cow tipping. Speaking of which, I think I'll go do that, it'll surely be much more fun than playing another second of this game.", "date": "Feb 19, 2000"}
