In the inevitable, but certainly not undeserved squeal to My Dog, I-play sends the sequel to its winning woofer to the big city. But before the big journey, the developer packed almost everything beloved about the first My Dog as well as a few new tricks, such as some ultra-casual mini-games to further your interaction with the so-adorable-it-hurts star of the virtual pet game.   The original My Dog game was an exceptionally deep game that held its cards quite close to the collar. Only through real devotion to the game did the puppy reveal all of its humor and wonders, which really isn't entirely unlike a real dog. But by hiding these rewards, a fair number of gamers missed too much -- this is something I-play has corrected (depending on how you want to look at it) in My Dog 2. The poppy still has its fair share of moods and demands, but everything happens a little closer to the surface.   After starting up the game, you select your pup via color and color alone. My Dog doesn't goof around with various breeds and temperaments, you simply select the coat color you want to look at for the next few months and then it's back to the house to start your relationship. Don't worry about missing out breeds, because the look of your puppy is a significant source of My Dog's charm. Your pup is composed entirely of circles. Not only does this unique look lend itself to some fun animations, but it's cute as all get-out.   The general flow of My Dog 2 isn't necessarily that different. You follow your puppy as it meanders through your home, clicking through the various rooms. When the pup is hungry, it knows to head for the kitchen and hang near its bowls. You simply click on the fridge to get out the food and the sink to fetch some water. Simple as that. When it's time to play, the pup might station itself in the living room, near toys. You absolutely must shower this pup with attention, stroking and tickling it. The pup's reactions to playing and petting are wonderful.   As you earn money while playing the game, you can check out a pet shop full of food and toys, keeping the pup consistently happy. Watch the pup's thought balloons to get a feel for the little fella's needs and moods. And if you want a more direct view, just log into your virtual computer inside the game to check out hard stats.   Playtime in Central Bark leads to outdoor activities, such as visiting the park alluded to in the game's sub-title. You and the pup can play while enjoy the sunshine and skyline of the big city. One thing to remember, though: If the pup goes poop in the park, you need to clean it up or be dinged a monetary fine.   In addition to basic playtime, you can also teach the puppy tricks, which is one of the new additions to My Dog 2. The pup can learn up to 21 tricks, each taught through very basic, one-button mini-games. These timing games aren't exactly that deep, but that plays into I-play general philosophy of offering one-thumb fun. Hardcore gamers aren't likely to check into Central Bark anyway, so why muddy up the place for them?   As mentioned earlier, the game is incredibly cute. I-play didn't mess with the overall appearance of the game very much, save for switching up the locations. The house from the first game is now a big city apartment. The pet shop is now owned by the kindly Chan. And you can also use photos of friends to replace the faces of in-game characters, which is a nice personalization touch since you really cannot affect the look of your pup or pad.I loved the original My Dog and I'm pleased to see that My Dog 2: Central Bark doesn't monkey with success. The game is only slightly more goal-oriented thanks to the teachable tricks, but otherwise this virtual pet sim that champions interaction more than notches on a ladder. You get the most of My Dog in the quieter moments, such as watching the puppy warmly react to being touched or a simple playtime in the grass. If you're looking for a game that offers little stress but plenty of reward, My Dog 2: Central Bark is a best of breed.", "date": "Nov 26, 2007"}
