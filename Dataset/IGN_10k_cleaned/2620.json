Because there's a hugely anticipated movie featuring the webslinger (you may have heard of it...it's directed by that Army of Darkness guy), Activision's right there with a Game Boy Advance adventure based off the flick. And if you're a Marvel super-hero nutcase or just a fan of really good action titles, Spider-Man on the GBA is an incredibly enjoyable gaming experience. Features More than a dozen levels 3D bonus levels Hidden secrets and photos Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  For the Spider-Man's second Game Boy Advance outing, Activision went with handheld developer veterans Digital Eclipse. As of this writing the movie hasn't hit the theaters yet, but it's a good bet that the Game Boy Advance plot only loosely follows the film's storyline; the GBA game doesn't do the ~secret origins~ thing at the beginning of the adventure like the console editions do. Here, Peter Parker is Spider-Man, just patrolling New York City...until he uncovers a plot that links crimes to a new villain, the Green Goblin. Players will encounter levels featuring familiar bad guys such as the Vulture, Shocker, Scorpion, and Kraven...but The Goblin is the real villain of the adventure.  In this platformer, players take Spider-Man and swing him across wide cityscapes, inside collapsing buildings, and in underground rail systems. You'll have to locate hostages, pick up bombs...or simply get to the end of a level without dying.  Our hero can stick to any vertical surface on the same 2D plane; if he can touch it, he can cling to it. This does get a little confusing since the artists and designers didn't really differentiate background objects from foreground objects...in the first level, for example, it's incredibly difficult to tell the difference between girders that you can climb, and those that are simply there to make the world look ~busy.~  Most of the game takes place in side-scrolling levels, but peppered between certain levels are bonus rounds that use a neat 3D/raycasting engine that mimics the console game's through-the-city webslinging levels. It's initially impressive since it puts awesome Spider-Man 2D animations over a semi-3D world...but it definitely isn't the most tweaked of the game's levels, as the framerate of the buildings and objects chug in the more populated areas. It's a decent test for what a Spider-Man game can end up being on the GBA in the future...but as of right now it's good that it was used strictly as an extra.  On the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox, console developer Treyarch went with an art style that would mimic the movie closely. But since the Game Boy Advance already received a realistic-looking Spider-Man game last year from Vicarious Visions, Digital Eclipse rightly went a different route. For the movie rendition, the development team created a slick comic book feel for the game's imagery, right down to the cartoon-style action interjections like ~bang!~ or ~kerpow!~ during the game's fist-to-face combat.   The animation in this game is absolutely top-notch, offering extremely exaggerated motions for our webslinging hero, giving him a ton of life to his actions. But it's this extra animation that makes the game feel too ~sticky~ in places...if, for instance, Spider-Man is in a crouching position on a ledge that he can stand up and walk on, to get him to a standing position means that the animation of him leaping upright has to be played...and this extra quarter-second pause in the action does affect the flow of the game. The designers also add a transparent fog layer to most of the outdoor levels. While this may make the imagery look cooler than it would without it, it must affect the performance of the engine...you'll notice a bit of sputtering framerate in several places throughout the adventure.  The boss battles are probably the weakest bit in Spider-Man, because the designers didn't really put together areas that force players to take advantage of our hero's special abilities. The battles between Vulture, Shocker, Kraven, and early battles with the Goblin basically require no webslinging or wall sticking...they're just a matter of waiting for them to come to you to knock 'em around with your fists. The game could have used a bit more imagination in these battles.  But overall, this game's a bit more enjoyable than the first Spider-Man game that hit the Game Boy Advance back in September 2001. This title has cartridge save that records your progress throughout the adventure, saving the level that you've last completed. This internal memory also records the hidden treats that you've uncovered in each area -- by accomplishing ~photo opportunity~ tasks in each level (hitting Select to take a snapshot when the game prompts you to), you'll unlock digitized shots from the movie. These snapshot triggers are in specific areas, some more hidden than others...this encourages a bit of exploration for levels that you've already finished, but for some reason, during the current game you cannot go back to levels that you've already completed.  Spider-Man's 2D titles haven't really strayed from the same formula used in past Game Boy adventures, and this game is a proper and excellent evolution of the franchise on the Game Boy Advance. Digital Eclipse addressed a couple of the issues I had with the previous Spidey title on the system -- this game has much better hand-to-hand combat, for example. The team also did a nice job incorporating Spider-Man's day job as a photographer in the game's design, though it would have been much cooler if the pictures you took would actually save to cartridge for future viewing. It's not without its problems, of course, but folks who happen to dig Spider-Man will probably seriously enjoy what the Digital Eclipse team has done to coincide with one of the biggest summer film events ever.", "date": "Apr 17, 2002"}
