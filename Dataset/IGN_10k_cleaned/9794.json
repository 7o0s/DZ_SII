Ignore for a moment that the career of Sega's iconic mascot has zig-zagged all over the map in recent years. You can sandwich a run through the Labyrinth Zone and a boss fight with Dr. Eggman between those Limp Biskit MP3s you stole in college and just can't bring yourself to delete just in case you need a soundtrack to an angry break-up. That, in itself, is really worth something. In just a year, the iPod has come a long way as a gaming rig.   Sonic the Hedgehog on the iPod is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the Genesis classic -- the blazingly-fast platform game that sliced up Nintendo's console dominance and introduced an entire generation of gamers to marketing buzzwords via the use of ~blast processing.~ If you've never played the original Sonic the Hedgehog, the iPod edition is admittedly not the best place to first experience this landmark game. Even though this is an accomplished port of the game, it really deserves to be enjoyed first with an actual controller nestled in your hands.   Sega has included two control schemes for Sonic's iPod adventure -- hardcore and casual. While it's certainly cool that they wanted to create an alternative for casual gamers, there's just no way around this: The casual controls are terrible. You simply cannot get a decent session with Sonic by sliding your finger around the wheel to make the little blue fella run and collect rings. It's maddening and decidedly un-fun.   The so-called hardcore control setting (it's labeled ~A~ in the menus) is by far the better deal, even if it's still not ideal. Using two thumbs, you click on the sides of the wheel to run left and right and pressing the center button to jump. In early stages, such as Green Hill Zone and Marble Zone, I could get through the levels in a decent amount of time with a solid ring count with these controls. I wasn't nailing things as well as I used to back on the original Genesis, but that's to be expected. However, getting to secret routes and making precision jumps with the click-wheel is really, really difficult. And not that fun difficult -- the challenge here comes from futzing with the wheel. Sonic just has a tendency to get away from you. I found myself grimacing on many, many occasions when Sonic melted in lava or fell on spikes because the wheel just isn't necessarily suited for this genre. It's workable, but far from perfect.   Now, my complaints about the controls might knock some of you out right away -- why download a game that you might struggle with? That's wholly understandable, but there are certainly a lot of good things Sonic the Hedgehog has going for it, such as still-awesome music and those very cool spinning bonus levels you unlock by crossing the finish line with a fat stack of rings. (A whole game of those bonus stages might make better sense next time.)   Sonic the Hedgehog is still an outrageously attractive game, too. On the iPod's crisp, bright screen, Sonic looks fantastic. The colors are as vibrant and eye-catching as ever. The level designs, complete with big loops to run through and backdrops loaded with detail are great. Really, Sonic remains one of the best-looking 16-bit games and Sega has done an amazing job recreating it on the iPod. Remember, this is not emulation -- this is entirely new code. Hopefully, this code will allow Sega to bring over other Genesis classics.Once the novelty of playing this landmark game on the iPod of all places dissipates, the issues with actually controlling Sonic start to keep pace with all the good stuff. The click-wheel was not designed with precision platforming in mind, so even though Sega has done an admirable job offering a duo of control schemes, there is still some interference that keeps you from having an top experience.", "date": "Dec 21, 2007"}
