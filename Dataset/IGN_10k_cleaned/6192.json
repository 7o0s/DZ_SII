The Nintendo DS has been a good platform for the company to test their creative juices for remakes and spinoffs, as the company has released not one, but two successful Pac-Man designs since the debut of the handheld system. Dig Dug is Namco's newest target for the move from arcade to DS, but Dig Dug: Digging Strike doesn't come off nearly as special as the Pac-Man updates on the system. It's fun in bursts, but there's not enough meat here for a contemporary design.   The design team uses the opportunity to go full circle by officially connecting Dig Dug to its Mr. Driller property; we've always known the lead in Mr. Driller was the offspring of the hero from the classic Dig Dug arcade game, and Dig Dug: Digging Strike hammers this point homealmost too much. The whole idea revolves around the father, the Dig Dug hero, getting more and more frustrated that his son, the Mr. Driller hero, is getting all the glory. So, when the time comes where the world needs a subterranean hero, he steps up to the plate to take the task at hand.   Dig Dug: Digging Strike is a somewhat clever melding of the original Dig Dug and Dig Dug II designs, simultaneously combining the two mechanics into one complete game. The idea is to destroy a larger enemy on the surface (upper screen) by driving piles into the ground (bottom screen), all the while avoiding and popping enemies with an air pump. By pounding these stakes all the way to the ground, fissures are created that, when connected, will cause a segment of the land to give way and sink into the ocean. By using this idea, players can collapse the huge beasts into the drink and save the day. It's all action with a bit of thought process required, because players need to think ahead in order to create the proper chunks of land to eliminate the boss in each level.   But here's the ~humor~ of it all: as much as he wants to do the job by himself and as powerful as he is, the pumpmaster just can't do it alone. Mr. Driller is always on call to lend Dad a helping hand to stun the big monster or to alter the direction of the earth cracks, as long as he grabs the right power-up. The designers parody other Namco arcade games in this mode, putting players in control of a Xevious ship or a Rally-X car in simple challenges to keep the monster in place on the upper screen. Retrogamers will get a chuckle out of the occasional references tossed into the action.   The game is clearly made as homage to the classic Namco Dig Dug game. The design sticks closely to the original design, even going as far as only playing the game's background music when the character's moving on the screen. The Dig Dug action is very faithful to the original game, even when there are new enemies to contend with, complete with new behavior before and after being popped.  But it's the fact that the game sticks so close to the original idea that brings down the fun of the remake. The original concept is made for the instant action environment of the arcade; the rigid control and repetitive action is only fun in short bursts, and it certainly wasn't made for an ~adventure~ style design.    The clearly old-school graphic design might be a bit fun to see in a contemporary game production, but that doesn't make the game any less ugly. The two-frame animations of the character and enemies stick to the original arcade game's feel, but it totally feels out of place because this is more supposed to be a sequel and the development team restricted its creativity by almost recreating a two decade old visual style. And even more disappointingly, even with the limited graphics, Namco couldn't manage to sandwich the engine into a single cartridge multiplayer option -- to play the two player game mode, each person needs a copy of the game.   And the flow of the game is far too choppy from level to level. Cutscenes telling the game's story and setting are tremendously bland and boring, and every time you set off a Mr. Driller mini-game you have to sit through an unnecessary introduction; this introduction's only a few seconds long, but it brings the action to a halt every time it happens.  Dig Dug: Digging Strike has some merit because, like the original Dig Dug, it's fun in quick single level shots. But this game property advancement isn't nearly as creative as Namco's other classic DS remakes, and its old-school presentation comes off more sloppy and lazy than it does clever. Only the truly die hard Dig Dug fans will appreciate the designers' nods to the original game, but even if you are you'll probably still wonder why the heck the new game is so limited in its enjoyment.", "date": "Oct 21, 2005"}
