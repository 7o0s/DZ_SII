No, neither do I. Or, rather, neither did I, for despite what I was expecting -- I mean a Smurf game is not exactly going to claim everyone's vote of confidence, and such licenses are usually wasted -- Smurfs' Nightmare turned out very good indeed. I had seen a good review of it in a magazine, plus some nice-looking screen-shots, and so I decided to ignore my initial misgivings and buy it, desperately trying to avoid the EB shop assistant's withering glare as I did so.    Features  Single player only  Six long, hard levels, with two 'stages' in each.  'Easy' and 'Hard' difficulty levels.  Plenty of bonus-levels and sub-games.  Beautiful 16-bit-like graphics.  Very nice music . Password save-system.  Game Boy Color only.   My first impressions were good: clear, colorful graphics, and nice, bouncy music. The movement of the Smurf seemed a tad slow though, and the gameplay basic, adding little to the genre, but nevertheless I went bravely onwards and found a very fun game which is, incidentally, the first released where I live that is Color only. That alone must mean that it's fairly proficient.   The evil Gargamel has trapped six Smurfs in their own nightmares, and as Hefty Smurf it is your job to rescue them. You begin in the village, with the six houses in front of you, which you must enter one at a time. Inside each are two long levels, and after you've beaten both you must solve a small sub-game which gives you the key to the next house.  Your Smurf's range of moves is initially a little limited, but there is enough variation to make the game fun. Green leaves are scattered throughout each of the levels, and the more you collect the higher you can jump. If you find over thirty then you can do a three-jump somersault combo much like the one in Mario 64, and gathering over 40 unlocks a bonus stage at the end of the level where you can collect extra lives and points. Different coloured potions grant you invincibility and other gifts, such as making the enemies freeze (always in annoying places though!); soap bubbles let you float up into the air; and on the later levels you can use rockets to boost you upwards and even fly with the aid of wings. Not a bad selection, in all.   The levels also have some simple puzzles, such as having to reach out of the way objects and travel around road-blocking obstacles, making it more a thinking platform game rather than a fast-paced, frantic Mario clone a la Gex. A few of the stages see you going from left to right, and others -- like the Kitchen and the Workbench -- are multi-layered, requiring you to go more from top to bottom. The sub-games are fun and quite tricky, involving such set pieces as a roaring tidal wave and an underground race on the back of a mole. In other words, its very varied indeed, despite first impressions to the contrary.   Visual Appeal  -- Ah, now this is where the game definitely excels, playing host to what are possibly the best visuals on the console so far. The colors are rich and varied without being garish, the backgrounds moody, extremely diverse, and always ideally suited to the theme of the level. There are no real effects as such, with most things static, but the overall look is amazing with some lovely detailed animation for all of the well-sized characters. The village sections also feature some beautiful use of parallax scrolling, giving the graphics a lot of depth, the layers of sky and ground moving at different speeds to the greenery and the houses, creating an effect similar to that used in Super Nintendo platformers. Overall, the game looks superb, being both clear and colorful, though it is disappointing that the parallax scrolling could not have been used on some of the actual levels (its absence is noticeably on the alien planet one especially).   Soundtrack  -- This is yet another section that the game performs admirably on. Most cartoon games have annoyingly twee, repetitive tunes, which soon cause you to reach for the volume control in disgust, yet here it is different. The tunes are nice and lively with some great spot effects, making them all memorable and eminently hummable. There is fantastic variety, with a different one for each level, and just like the graphics they always suit the current environment perfectly. The sound effects could be better -- the ones that are present are all well and good, but more would be welcome, though the catchy detailed tunes more than make up for this.    Overall, the game is a joy to play throughout, and -- surprisingly -- very hard. The levels are all long, and you have to start again from the beginning from each one upon dying (yet, strangely, you won't actually mind doing so), the two difficulty levels adding replay value. It's hard to describe exactly, but the great graphics and the fun sound, mixed with the tight controls and variety of tasks, all combine to make the game so playable. My only real gripe is the password system. I received my first password (and there are no Gex-like, ten million character disasters -- only three Smurf faces to remember) after the second stage, which was fine, but then you have to complete another three to get the next password and then another five after that! It does make the game last a long time despite the relatively small quota of levels, but when it's as hard as it is already (due to devious design) you can end up frustrated. Not a major problem -- and the feeling of reward when you get past each point is immense -- but something that could have been improved on.  I found this game both a very fun and challenging one. It's the first that I have seen to really make use the new hardware to add to an old genre, and this certainly shows in technical terms at least. Whilst the format is running a little tired and cliched, this is a great take on it, with quite a few new ideas combining with the old. Brilliant, and undeniably 16-bit.
