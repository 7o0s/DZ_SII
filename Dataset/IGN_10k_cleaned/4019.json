Sure, other games give you the chance to lock lightsabers with evil Jedis, topple crime syndicates, or build might mercantile empires, but nothing matches the mix of joy and relief I felt by blowing up a simply fuel dump after garroting a lone German sentry making his rounds.   The missions in Commandos 3 are every bit as hard as they were in the previous titles and this raises a key question for gamers: what's the difference between challenge and difficulty? Most good game developers heed the unspoken corollary of that question, namely that designers shouldn't be trying to beat the players; instead they should try to present missions that give players a chance to overcome meaningful obstacles through planning and improvisation. That's what Commandos 3 has and that's what keeps me coming back for more.   One thing that really sells Commandos is the sense of drama. I've been a fan movies like The Eagle Has Landed, The Guns of Navarone and The Dirty Dozen and Commandos captures the essence of these films perfectly -- a small group of specialists manage to win out over impossible odds. But though it captures the tactical side of those films (which is the best part anyway), the game fails to deliver in terms of story and character. The actual commandos are more caricatured personalities than actual people. Even their names have a slightly cartoonish quality (the green beret is named Tiny, the diver is named Fins) that keeps me from taking the game as seriously as I might.   But once the missions start, you won't even care about their names anymore. You'll be too busy trying to hitch a ride on Nazi trains escaping with precious art treasures, or going head-to-head with an enemy sniper in a bombed out Russian town or swimming into a harbor to sabotage U-boats before the D-Day landings. These are just three of the twelve total missions available to you in Commandos 3. This time around they're much tighter with some missions picking up literally where the last mission left off.   You'll need to negotiate each level (some are huge, others not so much) avoiding or eliminating guards. You can watch their patrol patterns and check their line of sight to make sure you'll have an opportunity to jump out, kill some guy and hide his body before someone else wanders along. The game definitely rewards players who are patient enough to try a variety of solutions to particular problems. Hell, I even replayed some missions right from the start once I figured out how I wanted to proceed through them. In short, it's all about rehearsal. Though it would be great to have a game that would allow you to improvise your assault right from the start and still have a chance of winning, it simply couldn't provide the challenge that's available with the more unforgiving approach here.   But though you can't play on the fly here (as least not as easily as you could in a title like Rainbow Six which shares the realism and planning focus of a game like Commandos), there's plenty of room for variety. Though their routes are scripted, the enemies do different things each time you load the mission and can sometimes really surprise you by doing something new the sixth or seventh time around. Having a guard suddenly turn left where he's always turned right can throw a heck of a wrench in your plans.    Wonderful though they are, you'll have your hands full enough without these small surprises. Your team requires a fair bit of babysitting and there are plenty of commands you'll need to use to keep them at their peak effectiveness. An auto-fire command really saves my ass here, letting me focus on one squad member while others guard various approaches. Setting these covered arcs requires a few too many clicks, quite honestly, but once you get the hang of the interface and the importance of cover commands, you won't have too much of a delay between deciding on a course of action and actually implementing it.     Thankfully, the puzzle elements have been kept fairly simple this time around. About the most complicated thing you'll need to do is put some sleeping pills in a steak and throw it at an enemy guard dog. While it's not super-intuitive, it makes enough sense from a standpoint of gameplay. But given the freedom you have, there are probably plenty of puzzle elements you'll never use. I, for one, still haven't found a need to use the diver's grappling hook on the ship sabotage mission but I haven't felt like I needed it for anything, so it's no great loss. (A worse crime is that the diver only makes his appearance in one mission.)   Apart from the poisoned dog food taking the form of a glowing green bone, I think Pyro's done a great job with the graphics here. The 2D isometric view is kind of an old beast but it looks absolutely fantastic here thanks to some first-rate art direction. The entire game has an illustrated quality to it that perfectly fits the subject matter. (When I was a kid, I'd read and reread his old war comics, so I kind of have that association going in to it. Still, others who weren't subjected to Kurtzman and his ilk seem to feel the same way I do.) The environments are full of detail, from little soldiers standing around smoking to solid sheets of rain that cascade down the length of the screen. Character animations are also handled quite well.   Pyro's added full 3D interiors to the game. Though it clashes a bit with the flat exteriors, it's a nice direction. Most of the problems presented by the four-way camera (of which more in a minute), are eliminated with the freely rotating camera in the interiors. Architecture sometimes conspires to hide areas from you which can be frustrating. There's some huge grey bar in my way when I peek through a certain train car door. I still haven't been able to account for it. I also wonder why the camera won't bump scroll on the interiors. Since it works on the exterior shots, it seems stupid to have to switch to a different system for interiors, particularly since bumping the cursor against the edge of the map doesn't seem to have any other use.   If I had to find another flaw in terms of graphics, it would be that enemies aren't always displayed conveniently. There's a great feature that lets you illuminate all the enemies in red (and you can even see them through certain objects in the environment), there are a few cases where enemies aren't always as apparent as they ought to be. In some cases, they're simply right on the edge of the map. Since the screen doesn't scroll all the way to the edge, there are some enemies that you can only spot if the camera is just right. Even then you may find that you can only see their feet. Camera orientation can also be a problem on maps with tall structures. Though you can see the red outline of an enemy through, say, a water tower, you can't actually target them unless you rotate the camera to get a clear view of them. And when I say ~get a clear view~ I'm speaking of the player's view, not the character's.   Soundwise, the score's the best thing about the game. It fits the mood perfectly and provides a great backdrop that only heightens the action on screen. Things aren't quite as good when it comes to effects. Though they're satisfactory overall, some of the weapon and explosion sounds seem a bit on the weak side. The small unit acknowledgements can get a bit tiresome sometimes as does the constant grunting your team emits every time they touch a ladder. Unh, climb, unh, climb, unh. The accents of the squad are fairly broad, perhaps intentionally so -- then again, maybe that's just how the rest of the world sounds if you're Spanish. The varied German utterances are a bit better and add a lot of atmosphere and excitement to the game.   This third version of Commandos has finally added multiplayer options to the mix and though we think it's a great addition to the series and has a fair bit of potential, there's a lot of room for improvement here. First up there's an almost total lack of documentation and support for the feature. With this being the first multiplayer outing for the series, we hoped that the manual would outline more than just the most basic of options.   But after playing around in multiplayer, it's become kind of apparent that aren't really that many varieties of multiplayer game types. You can play with the basic commando units, regular allied soldiers or a combination of the two. In terms of game types, you can either play simple deathmatches or capture the flag. In the flag capture mode, you'll only need to travel around and pick up the flags scattered about the level to win.   Other issues continue to frustrate. Thus far we've only been able to get the game up and running on a LAN, for one. For some strange reason, that matches also don't seem to end on their own. Once Dan killed all my guys (for the hundredth time), we had to quit the match manually before restarting. Since the allied soldiers aren't hotkeyed like the commandos, it can be hard to locate them from time to time. It's great that the team has included the single player maps in multiplayer and it's even better that they've included an option to switch your view from room to room.    We tend to think that taking on the single player missions with a buddy or two would be a helluva lot of fun. It certainly would present some real frustrations given the coordination of effort required to pass some of the sequences, but, at the very least, adding a few objectives to multiplayer would go a long way towards enhancing my enjoyment and strengthening the Commandos feel. Imagine how much more fun these matches would be if one team had to protect a vehicle from destruction...or assassinate a general the other team was tasked with protecting. The deathmatch and even flag capture modes seem largely pointless when compared with the offline missions.  It's easy to hate Commandos 3 purely on the basis of the difficulty level. But that's also why we love the game so much. While no other franchise can present you with so many seemingly insurmountable challenges, no other franchise is able to offer such a feeling of accomplishment once the objectives are miraculously achieved. For most gamers it will come down a matter of patience; if you're willing to put up with the frustration of frequently failing, the missions offer some amazing opportunities to flex and refine your tactical skills. Once you've succeeded, you'll find that the satisfaction lingers long after the glory of finishing other games has faded.Multiplayer seemed like a bigger deal before we actually got our hands on it. As it is, it adds a little bit to the fun factor but falls short in terms of preserving the character of the game and stumbles over a few technical hurdles as well. But as that's clearly not the main thrust of the game, we're willing to cut Eidos and Pyro some slack here only because they've made such a great single player game.", "date": "Oct 16, 2003"}
