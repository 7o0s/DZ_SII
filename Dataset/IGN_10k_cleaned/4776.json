{"name": "Super Collapse! II", "name_review": "Super Collapse II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/16/super-collapse-ii-2", "text": "is another one of the several PC downloadable games that Majesco has commissioned for a Game Boy Advance version. The game, designed by Game House, is, like the other puzzle games in Majesco's line-up, available for freeplay on the internet, and its ~to go~ edition for the GBA retains pretty much all of the gameplay that made the PC version such a popular download. It's a solid and fun tile-based puzzle game with one huge design flaw: the lack of any cartridge save makes it less portable friendly since players can't record high scores or progress without having a pen and paper handy.  The gameplay mechanics of  Super Collapse's several modes of play revolve around ~zapping~ linked blocks of colors to eliminate them from the on-screen bin. Players remove tiles from play by clicking on groups of three or more that touch other like colors on any one of the four sides. The tiles remaining in the bin will fall and group together to form more clusters that could possibly create more groups of three. It's tried-and-true puzzle mechanics, and they're pulled off very well in Super Collapse.   In Classic Mode, players simply work through a bin of colored tiles that slowly fills from the bottom; when the level ends, players are rewarded by the amount of empty space left in the bin, and extra points are given for entire rows left open. Relapse Mode doubles up Classic Mode by arranging tiles both on the floor and on the ceiling. Strategy Mode takes the Classic Mode's design and spices it up by building the bin up an entire line of tiles every time players remove a grouping. And Puzzle Mode puts a lot more thought into the idea by forcing players to remove every single tile in a layout...none can be left behind. Super Collapse II is solidly designed, as well as challenging and fun, but fails to fit the Game Boy Advance simply due to Majesco's choice of not putting a tiny SRAM chip in the cartridge. Puzzle games on the GBA lose their appeal when players A) can't record their position in the game, and B) can't save their high scores. The game's not going to win any awards for its graphical or audio presentation; the GBA version of Super Collapse II is fully based upon the look and sound of the PC download version. Its charm comes from the simplistic but addictive puzzle gameplay, even if its incredibly unoriginal. The choice to put a password ~save~ hurts the enjoyment of the GBA version more than Majesco may realize; without any way to save the game's data, players don't have set scores to shoot for, nor can they stop in the middle of a puzzle session on the road. If you're willing to cart around a pad of paper with your GBA system, go for it. Otherwise, stick with the PC rendition.", "date": "Jun 16, 2004"}
