Battle Lode Runner, while not a spectacular title on its own has enhanced graphics, sound and array of gameplay options look quite a bit more attractive when compared to this NES original.   Lode's all about the gold -- he loves the stuff. He collects it by the pile, running through a darkened world of bricks and ladders to find it. He can't jump, which complicates matters a bit as he sprints around each maze, but he can dig holes.           Your one and only method of interaction with the environment is to dig -- the B Button digs on your left, the A Button on your right. It's not so much digging, though, as it is just pointing at a brick and making it disappear. Removing the masonry serves two purposes: it allows you access to levels of the labyrinth buried underneath, and it allows you to create pitfalls to capture assaulting enemies. Old-school Hudson fans will recognize the foes as none other than Bomberman. Or Bombermen, rather, the faceless, multiple clones of the Hudson hero. They won't attack with explosives, though, just themselves -- one touch is all it takes to rid you of your life.   So Lode Runner's a fairly basic action-puzzler overall. You avoid the enemies, collect the gold, and climb the ladder to the next stage to rinse and repeat the whole process. It can be an addictive design, and was remarkably popular back in the '80s. This NES edition was just one of several ports the game had at the time, most of the others going to various home computer platforms of the day.   The question, then, goes back to one of value: as Lode Runner now sits opposed that other ported version, Battle Lode Runner. It's no contest, unfortunately. Battle Lode Runner's much more robust. It looks better, it sounds better, and it even supports up to five players at once in simultaneous multiplayer battle matches. This NES Lode Runner doesn't have all that. Sure it has a multiplayer mode, but it's just an alternating, back-and-forth competition between two people that challenge for a high score. Not simultaneous play. There's an Edit Mode that lets you create your own stages, which was novel for an NES title, but again, the TurboGrafx Battle edition did that better, too.   The one thing Lode Runner purists may prefer about this version is its sense of speed. NES Lode Runner is faster and more frantic than the more-forgiving Battle edition, and represents a greater challenge in that way. But then, again, true Lode Runner purists would also know that there's a superior version for that aspect too, in the form of Championship Lode Runner: a later NES release that took the design to its most intense extreme.So it seems we've run out of potential positives. There's no redeeming Lode Runner here, and no getting past the fact that investing similar money for Battle Lode Runner would be a much wiser move. Gran this only if you're nostalgic for NES releases, otherwise, step up and grab the superior sequels.", "date": "Jun 12, 2007"}
