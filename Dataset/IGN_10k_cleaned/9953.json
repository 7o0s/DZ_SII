Yes, the game is on Wii, and has the word ~Sports~ included, but this  like so many Conspiracy Entertainment games before it  is more about cashing in on Wii's success, rather than truly contributing to it.  To be fair though, Winter Sports is a heck of a lot better than the majority of shovelware games on the console, as the game has some decent graphics at times, uses some solid Wii motion, and can actually be pretty fun in small doses.  In the end though, you're still going to want to give this one a rent, or pass it up all together.   Winter Sports: The Ultimate Challenge 2008 is responsible for a small burst of interest across various internet gaming communities as of late. The game went virtually unnoticed in its release, and the fact that it mixes some pretty solid motion control with a halfway decent visual look means it's bound to spark some interest here and there.  Winter Sports takes nine individual events, and lets players experience them in single or multiplayer events, or in a full campaign mode.  The modes and options themselves are nothing to write home about, and what it ultimately boils down to is how much fun the actual events are.  As far as that goes, Winter Sports is a bit of a mixed bag.  This is what the game would look like if it was running on Xbox 360. (PR Wii screenshot)  When we said there were nine events, we didn't lie.  Then again, when Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games labeled each of the different sprint events as different, they weren't lying either.  Winter Sports includes alpine skiing, ski jumping, speed skating, cross-country skiing, bobsled, luge, skeleton, figure skating, and curling.  Most of these games set themselves apart pretty well from each other, with speed skating working off simple controller drumming, while cross-country skiing uses a more methodic back and forth saw motion, but bobsled, luge, and skeleton are nearly identical.  Each event  again like Mario & Sonic  focuses on one simple motion, but in turn can be pretty fun despite its simplicity.  After a quick round of experimentation we could go without playing figure skating and the tilt-based luge/skeleton experiences, but alpine skiing is a blast to control, and we wish there was more to it.  Using both the Wii-mote and nunchuk controller players tilt them in unison like a pair of skiis.  Holding down Z and B (depending on the foot you're carving with) will dig that ski into the snow to carve harder.  It's simple, but pretty rewarding.   In general the controls (and gameplay, for that matter) aren't going to be all that deep, but for a basic time-waster Wii Winter Sports gets the job done.  We wouldn't suggest going out and dropping full price on the experience, but for a quick rental this one isn't a bad option.  In fact, the only thing holding back Wii Winter Sports as a full-fledged Wii product is its lack of depth.  The games control well  with the exception of curling, which is like a half-broken game of Wii Bowling  but the overall design throws the nine events at you, and leaves you to your own devices.  Despite some pretty well-doctored screens that have been circulating the net, Wii Winter Sports isn't much of a looker, and the audio is also made up of some pretty simple musical tracks and sound effects.  Also, there's a disturbing bear mascot constantly running around before every event, which throws off our A-game every time.  Here's the game running on Wii. (Final build screencap)  Each of the single player modes take those same nine events, and repackage them.  It's never a mind-blowing experience, but again, we can tell there was some effort put into delivering the full ~Olympic Games~ feeling.  You can play through a campaign mode which centers around challenges and breaking record times, or instead go through the actual career mode and play through each event, starting with the opening ceremonies and progressing through them one by one.  It's never a terribly deep experience, but it's more than most quick cash-in Wii games offer.  In a sea of Wii shovelware, Wii Winter Sports isnt the worst choice you could make.  Conspiracy apparently picked this one up for cheap, but for fans of downhill skiing and a handful of other Olympic events, The Ultimate Challenge 2008 will satisfy for at least long enough to warrant a rental.  The control works for the most part (aside from a pretty unsatisfying curling experience), but its never more than a quick arcade-inspired mini-game the likes of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.  The graphics arent nearly as polished as official screens would have you believe, and the game  while better than every other Conspiracy effort thus far  grows dull fast.  Unless you can find this one extremely cheap, skip it.", "date": "Feb 5, 2008"}
