The US version of what was known on the PC and on the Japanese Dreamcast as Redline Racer, the title comes our way via none other than Criterion Studios, the same development house behind Trickstyle.  Sadly, unlike the developer's launch title, Suzuki Alstare Racing misses the mark in too many ways to warrant purchase.  From the second you start a race, actually, you'll see the influence of Criterion in Suzuki.  The game just looks like Trickstyle, with a similar CG-style motif.  Everything's real shiny, complete with crazy reflections, like something you'd expect to see in a CG movie that doesn't attempt to mimic reality (think Beast Wars and Reboot, and you'll know what I'm talking about).  This theme works well in Trickstlye, as that game uses hoverboards and seems to be set in the future, but in a motorcylce game, it comes off as somewhat inappropriate.  When combined with a complete lack of personality and character, things that Trickstyle had in spades, you end up with a graphical shell that does nothing for the game.  What's even worse is that the graphics engine in Suzuki seems almost like an alpha version of that found in Trickstyle (it probably is, seeing as how Redline Racer was released to the PC last year).  The problem centers around the geometry for the tracks and bikers not being up to the level of the recent launch title.  The developers also seem to have ignored the notion of draw-in what-so-ever, allowing the horizon to, at times, slowly fill in with color, as if some artist was frantically working away at pencilling in the track.  Other games certainly have draw in, but the developers usually try and soften the effect by fading the backgrounds in slowly.  Beyond these problems, the game does manage to impress a bit in the graphics department.  Everything moves as smoothy as you'd want, and you'll find nothing in the way of aliasing problems.  Still, the graphics aren't all that impressive compared to the other Dreamcast games out there.  The sound, unfortunately, manages to disappoint entirely.  The techno music would be more appropriate in a different style of racing game, and even then, only a few of the tracks are a good listen, with most of them just sitting in the background and making you feel like parking you're your cycle and heading off to bed.  As for sound effects, yikes!  These bikes have little variety in the way of engine sounds, and hardly manage to exercise that powerful Dreamcast sound chip.  All these presentation and superficial issues could be forgiven if the game were any good.  In fact, there are a few good elements to the game, but for every good point, there is a bad point.  First, the good.  The game has a reasonable number of bikes and tracks.  You can enter a tournament, pick your bike, make a few modifications, then head off to race, trying to place high in the tournament in order to unlock new tracks and bikes.  The tracks actually have some nice design elements, with twists, turns, a few hills and ramps (although I would have like to have seen more in the way of jumps), and a couple of cool little shortcuts that, when you find them, manage to make you utter ~Oh yeah, baby!~.   Thankfully, the control of your bikes feels good, with analogue steering, accelerating, and braking.  There's also a well-done two player mode, which manages to get by with only minimal loss of quality.  Now, the bad.  The game, first off, takes far too simple an approach towards modifications.  Being that I'm not the greatest car or motorcylce buff out there, I can appreciate a simplified modification interface (Gran Tourismo nearly scared the manhood out of me), but with only three available modifications, all of which affect one another (so, if you increase power, your steering automatically decreases), I couldn't help but feel that the title was a little lacking.  Regarding the control, you'll still manage to find yourself frustrated at the game, due, in large part, to the crashing scheme and the few bugs here and there.  If you hit a wall, you'll go flying off your bike, which is, I suppose, acceptable (although boy does it look silly when the biker somehow manages to fall INTO a mountainside).  The problem is that this happens far too much, as the game is too sensitive.  There should be a certain amount of grace given to the rider, allowing you to slide against the walls just a bit.  What's even worse is that the crashing system is buggy.  I'd sometimes fly off my bike, and my biker would repeat the crashing animation sequence twice.  I also managed to get my bike stuck behind a fence a couple of times, and the only means for the game's getting me out of this predicament was to force me into the crashing animation.  There are also some problems involving the bad behavior of your opponents.  They don't seem to care about hitting you, which would be a good thing, if Criterion had managed to fit this into the game just a bit more.  It's not like they needed to give the riders weapons or anything, but if they were trying to make sliding up against your opponent an integral part of the gameplay, just as it is in arcade racers out of Sega, they didn't do a good job of it.  What this game needs is a little more direction, a little more personality, and a few updates to the gameplay department.  If you're looking for a good motorcylce racing game, wait for the motocross title out of Acclaim (assuming motocross will fit the bill for you).  If you're looking for something with the futuristic graphical style found in Suzuki, get Trickstyle, a much better representation of it.  If you're looking for a racing game in general, choose from Rally 2, Speed Devils, or Tokyo Xtreme.  In short, I'm not sure why anyone would want this game.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 14, 1999"}
