Like other popular newspaper games such as crosswords and word searches, this modified version of ~Latin Squares~ can turn your mornings into afternoons pretty quickly. Even if you have an aversion to numbers (as most IGN editors do), Sudoku's basic logic puzzles can still grip you like one of Genji's giant crab claws... and don't think it won't.   But ~what is Sudoku~ you ask? It's a brain teaser made up of nine 3x3 boxes that must be filled with the numbers 1 through 9. The hitch is that each puzzle has its own solution based on whatever preset numbers have been assigned and none of the numbers in your formula may repeat in the same horizontal or vertical column. It may sound a little complicated on paper, but don't worry, it's actually less convoluted than it sounds. In fact, after two or three games, playing it should come as second nature.    Given its easy learning curve and pick up and play nature, Sudoku is a natural for Sony's PlayStation Store. To help hammer that point home, Sumo Digital has ported its PSP title, Go! Sudoku to PS3 with pretty good results. Many of the same modes that were in the handheld version have made it to console as well; ~Solo Classic~ challenges users to finish a puzzle faster than the required time, while ~Solo Arcade~ uses a timer that counts down rather than up (it can also have time added when players successfully finish a number chain). Two multiplayer modes have been thrown too. ~Versus~ pits up to four online players in a race to see who can finish a puzzle first, while ~Battle~ allows you to compete with up to four players in an effort to see who can form as many cells as possible. It's a nice twist on what's otherwise, a rather straightforward game.   Of course, the main thing to remember about any Sudoku title-turned-software is that, like any other board or card game, it is what it is. So what really matters in the videogame version is how everything is presented. In that regard, there's nothing truly special going on. Barely-there music with ambient sounds and abstract shape-based backgrounds play out as you progress (often reacting to your moves), but some of the visuals can get a little distracting. The Leaderboards aren't exactly intuitive either, so it may be difficult for some to understand just how they place against their friends. At least it has 1080i support, though.   Despite its lackluster presentation, you still get a lot for the money. And by money, we're talking free. In a welcome move, SCEA is charging nothing to download the base game and its initial easy puzzles (520 in all). Each additional add-on is only a couple dollars more, which are broken up into skill levels: Mild - 380 puzzles, Difficult - 200 puzzles, and Fiendish - 100 puzzles. It's a good upgrade system and it ensures that fans of any level will get exactly what they pay for.If you like Sudoku and don't want to buy one of those cheap-o puzzle books to play it, then Go! Sudoku is a decent pick up. You can't beat 520 puzzles free of charge and the competitively-priced add-ons are a great added value. Just don't expect anything revolutionary in terms of presentation or modes.", "date": "Dec 15, 2006"}
