This is essentially mobile jigsaw puzzling -- players are charged with assembling a collection of pieces to reveal a picture from Amy's digital travels. Each puzzle is composed of 48 pieces for easy consumption (any more and it would be impossible to see the interlocking pieces), and if you put them together, you'll see pictures of dogs, flowers, and other cutie-poo objects.   The mechanics of Jigsaw Scrapbook actually sound a little boring from the outside looking in. I'm as big of a proponent for casual, one-thumb games as you are ever going to find -- but the pitch of sliding together some itty-bitty pieces didn't exactly appeal to me. However, there is a very cool feature in Jigsaw Scrapbook that -- in my opinion -- is a complete redeemer.   You can use your handset's camera to take your own pictures and turn them into puzzles. This individual customization makes the game a lot more fun -- I definitely enjoyed putting together a picture of my German Shepherd, Nausicaa, rather than some unknown pooch. I went around my house, taking pictures of my animals, my 360,  and some video game box covers (Burnout Revenge was a good challenge). Amazing how when something takes on a personal touch, your interest can be totally sparked.   (And if your phone does not have a camera, you can at least download additional puzzles from Centerscore's servers.)   Assembling the puzzles is a timed ordeal, so there is the challenge of trying to beat your best times. And Centerscore smartly divides the pieces (pre-puzzle) into two categories: center and edge. This way, you can easily concentrate on the edges of the puzzle, and then work your way inside. Another smart design choice: One you lock together pieces that properly fit, you can move the entire grouping around as a whole. This is especially helpful when working on the interior of the puzzle.  Amy's Jigsaw Scrapbook is one of the most ~casual~ casual games I have ever played -- and it may even be a little too laid back for some players. However, I really loved being able to personalize my puzzles. There is a certain satisfaction you get from assembling a photograph of your cat that just isn't generated from piecing together a random flower.", "date": "Mar 17, 2006"}
