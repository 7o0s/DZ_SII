Sony Pictures Entertainment indulges such wish fulfillment with Casino Royale, an action game based on the new James Bond film starring Daniel Craig as a more back-to-basics Bond. The game follows the film's plot, starting with a scene at an African construction site and heading right through to the events surrounding the titular casino showdown with the terrorist Le Chiffre. (There's more here, too, but perhaps revealing some scenes would act as a movie spoiler.)   By now, some of you have glanced over at the score and muttered, ~Surprise, surprise -- Levi bags on another licensed game.~ It's true, I am bagging on another licensed game, because Casino Royale follows in the long-standing tradition of mediocre mobile games tied with movie launches. (The ones that launch independently of a movie premiere fare much better since there are fewer time constraints in the development cycle. And I've spoken with a few developers that will back that statement up.)    Casino Royale really does play out like Splinter Cell in a tux. Standing in for Sam Fisher, James Bond has a series of superspy moves, like sneaking up to enemies an executing them in stealth kills, but is also quite handy with firearms ranging from handguns to sniper rifles. The problem with Casino Royale's imitation is that Gameloft has the formula down so tight that they could probably turn out the next Splinter Cell game in their sleep. (I would argue, on some level, that they did with Double Agent -- a solid game that relies too heavily on the formula.)   Casino Royale offers no big ~cool~ moments either, such as the first time Ethan Hunt grabs a thug by the chest and shoots him point blank in the gut in Mission: Impossible III. As such, it's just a basic action-with-light-puzzles game that cribs elements from other titles while adding few new ones of its own.   The first mission works as tutorial, teaching you how to move around, shoot enemies, and engage in hand-to-hand combat. Bond has a mean hook and I often found it more enjoyable to bust chops than use a gun. There are Bond moves, mapped to a soft key, that include special attacks to finish off enemies in more dramatic means than a shot to the chest. You're told when you can implement most Bond moves, which takes away some of the pleasure of discovery. Do I just empty my clip into these bad guys? Or is there something in the environment I can use to kill them all at once? Bond also uses a key matching minigame for specialized actions, such as picking locks. Follow the on-screen prompts correctly and you'll diffuse a bomb.   The levels are not very large, but often multi-storied. Bond must shimmy across rails, climb poles, and swing from ropes to move through stages and eliminate all threats. Move quickly, because at the end of a stage, you are rewarded with skill points depending on performance (accuracy, number of kills, completion time, etc.). You can spend these points on Bond's different traits, such as his punching strength or number of bullets he can absorb.   But at no point is Casino Royale a pulse-raising adventure. If anything, I found myself just going through the paces, playing through a totally competent, but unexciting, game. Perhaps the most memorable thing about Casino Royale is the animation. It's downright bizarre in places. When you start to move Bond after a stand-still moment, it just looks strange. Bond does not move like a human being. At least, none I've ever seen. It's distracting.   I played Casino Royale on a new LG VX8600, which features a clean, bright screen. The graphics are passable, but certainly not inspiring. The character spites are decent-sized and feature useful health bars over their heads that do not obscure any of the necessary game area. Characters from the movie appear in-game via tiny portraits that look reasonably like the actors.  Casino Royale tries to be a well coiffed Splinter Cell, but ends up feeling like a paler imitation. The action isn't very cinematic, it's just a basic run-and-shoot game with a smattering of puzzles. And Bond's movements are just odd -- odd enough to mention twice. Casino Royale is by no means the worst movie game I've played, but I cannot help wonder what it might have been with some extra time in development. The movie features some stunning moments to be sure, and I wish they could have been replicated better in the game.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
