Named after the Episode I prequel, Battle for Naboo sets out not to bring the movie to life, but rather the world and style it was set in. Quite simply, there aren't many titles available for the PC quite like it, bar Factor Five's previous PC release Rogue Squadron. As soon as Rogue Squadron hit the market, it received high acclaim. It was only a matter of time until developers Factor 5 and LucasArts followed it up with another fast-flying action shooter. Battle for Naboo proves to be a worthy follow up to Rogue by improving on nearly everything from the first title, except two years has really put the PC leaps and bounds ahead of the N64.   You get a chance to fight with and lead the rebels through the Episode I world via the hands of movie side-characters Captain Kael and Lt. Sykes. This makes for a very bold attempt to create a storyline, because you won't be controlling the most popular characters from the silver screen. Instead the plot parallels the action found in the movie and occasionally tosses you into the middle of some of its biggest moments. This is good for the reason that it lets you play a supporting role on the shell of the Episode I storyline, but on the other hand you can't help but feel disconnected from the world-altering Star Wars license. After all, The Phantom Menace was hard enough for Star Wars fans to adjust to. Being part of the outside of that story will be hit and miss with followers of the series.  But, enough about that; while the storyline plays an integral role, it's the gameplay that will overshadow it all. And overshadow is just what it does. When you think of Star Wars you think of lots of glowing lasers and plenty of turrets and enemies to go with them. This is one area that isn't overlooked. You'll be humming along in your N-1 Starfighter as one of your co-pilots screams out for backup. Then 10 enemy fighters will fly by like a flock of birds and you'll instantly be thrown into the chase. This is what Battle for Naboo is all about. Each level (and there are 15 of them, not counting the hidden ones) offers several of these scripted battles and objective briefings that always come via a cut-scene.   But all the action doesn't take place in the air. This prequel-based game provides an unlikely offering of vehicles -- both ground and air. In just the first two levels you'll saddle up in three different types of craft. It's this kind of diversity that gives Battle for Naboo its kick. Without it, the constant seek and destroy gameplay could have become redundant.   With that in mind, though, it would have been great if some of the objectives revolved around more than just destroying the enemy's firepower. A few cutscenes come to mind. One shows your team firing at a bridge to knock it down, and another shows your teammate shooting down some boulders to block the enemy's path. These more ~passive~ actions can add a lot of depth to gameplay and it would have been nice to see some of this. That's not to say that it's completely absent. Some levels allow you to destroy antennas to knock down shield power, and at other points you may have to destroy a specific part of a stronghold. Regardless, though, most of the gameplay revolves around protecting your crew and fending off the enemy. It's not a bad thing at all, in fact it's often quite enjoyable, but some of those more ~adventurous~ objectives could help mix things up.  How might one sum up the entire experience? To put it simply, Battle for Naboo is a well-crafted sci-fi adventure with intense and ferocious gameplay. Put that on your box, Lucas. You're going to want to use a gamepad since this is based on the Nintendo 64 home console version. It's best if you arrange a setup familiar to the N64 control, making an analog stick a must-have. Once you get around that the control is fairly intuitive (especially familiar to Rogue Squadron experts) so it pulls you into the dogfights without any overhead.  Nearly every level features a different atmosphere -- all very realistic -- which is complimented by their immense proportions. And, it features the technical brilliance to back it all up. Really, we only have a few reservations about the gameplay. The first and most notable drawback is my lack of interest in the characters and world around you. Not many people really like the Episode I theme when it comes to Star Wars. Most self-respecting fans have to admit it will always be more enjoyable to take the X-Wing up against TIE Fighters. Another drawback is the radar system. It's not the most intuitive radar ever created and occasionally it will send you reeling in circles. But it's real inadequacies come into play on the outer space levels. Because there is no way to tell what altitude plane your enemies or target lies upon, many players could end up cruising around blindly for a while. Some up or down arrows would have greatly helped. In general, though, these are minor issues. Ones that may go easily overlooked for some.   Graphically the game isn't all that impressive on the PC. This is mainly because Battle for Naboo was ported directly from the N64 engine, so the polygon counts weren't increased at all. In fact, the only difference graphically between the N64 and PC version is that the PC uses much larger textures. Sadly, the frame rate suffers because it wasn't optimized for the PC. It's certainly not bad, but it's not a constant 60 frames per second.  LucasArts decided to release this for the PC because of the gameplay value, not to show off what they could do on the PC visually.  Aside from the graphics, the sound is also a straight port from the N64 version. Because of this the sound clarity isn't what you'd expect a PC game to be, necessarily. However, it does support full Dolby Surround so you'll be able seek and destroy a little easier. The sound effects are very accurate and will please Star Wars fanatics. Ships will quietly hum in the distance or blaze over your cockpit. It's all extremely atmospheric and noticeable. You won't have any regrets there, and the voice acting is just as plentiful. Each mission is briefed in full voice, and all throughout the missions your team will constantly talk to you and keep you informed on the current situation.  All in all, Battle for Naboo is as close to the George Lucas devised cockpit as we're seen in a long, long while. If you're looking for that Episode I experience, look no further. With 15+ missions there is plenty to keep you busy, and it's pretty damn fun to boot. All of the levels offer up a unique experience because of the selectable vehicles, which also mixes up gameplay style. In turn, you have to accustom yourself to each of the ship's control style making winning that much more challenging. Each level is probably only five to 10 minutes long, depending on how well you play, but because some levels are more challenging than others it should take you a while to beat Battle for Naboo. To add to the replay value, though, you can pick up bronze, silver, and gold medals to increase your pilot ranking. The incentive to do this, of course, is that there are hidden levels and ships to be unlocked.   The biggest thing lacking in Battle for Naboo is the absence of a multiplayer mode as well as the mediocre graphics. On the PC this could have greatly extended the replay value, but because this is an N64 port the development team didn't have time to devise a multiplayer system.   The point is, however, Battle for Naboo is a focused single-player experience, and should be thought of as that. If you liked Rogue Squadron you'll definitely enjoy Battle for Naboo. Outside of that there's little titles that compete with this genre on the PC right now, so it's recommended you pick this title up if you're interested in a little arcade space fighter action.  It's not the deepest game in the genre, but it's still a lot of fun in short bursts.  -- Fran Mirabella III     Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Battle for Naboo doesn't waste its time holding your hand in the first few levels. You're thrown into fierce fight sequences and ordered to complete objectives without question. This is all for the better, because the control and gameplay is so intuitive that you wouldn't want to spend your time crusing around a training room learning how to steer. Surprisingly, though, I find the later levels to be the most enjoyable. Much of the beginning revolves around land-based battles and even city battles. Shotting droids is fine and dandy, but when it comes down to it taking on a flock of Tie Fighters...err, I mean droid ships is what it's all about. Who can remember the names anyhow, I mean this is Episode I, it's not remotely as memorable as the original Trilogy, which is one of the major drawbacks of this license. Regardless, taking on a flock of the enemy ships can be pretty intense. There's just so many of them and you feel empowered by the experience. This is what I feel the game is all about: feeling empowered by something as little as an intimidating flyby. In the end, I only have a few complaints with Battle for Naboo. You can only be ordered to blow up the enemy or protect your crew so many times. I hope in the future that titles like this receive a little more attention to the objective list. Surely rebels have something better to do like steer their way through an asteroid field or forest. Even an objective such as picking up an item and transporting it might provide a little diversity in the gameplay. Aside from all that, though, I'm entirely satisfied with Battle for Naboo and highly recommend to anyone who's into this type of game. If you're a skill freak you'll spend a lot of time perfecting your accuracy in this. Any fan of Rogue Squadron should enjoy Battle for Naboo just as much if they can get past the Episode I barrier. Oh, and one last thing. Remember that this follows the same path that Rogue Squadron did. To say that there aren't many secrets would be downright slanderous. It features some of the coolest secret levels and bonuses any N64 cartridge has ever seen.", "date": "Mar 20, 2001"}
