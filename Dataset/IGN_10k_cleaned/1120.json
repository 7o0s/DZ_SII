Warlocked is one hell of a game, especially as a first attempt bringing the game style of PC games such as Warcraft and Command & Conquer to the much less powerful Game Boy Color hardware. Is the system capable of the PC classics? Probably not  but that's just perfectly fine, because Warlocked is a fantastic real-time strategy game that's exclusive to us portable gamers.FeaturesMore than 24 missionsDigitized speechMini-games like Poker and slide puzzlesInfra-red support for trading units between systemsLink cable support for two playersBattery back-up, save any timeOnly for Game Boy ColorI think that Bits Studios would have run into a lot of problems trying to convert the popular RTS games from the PC to the Game Boy Color, which is why it's a very good thing that the company chose to bring an original game to market. Warlocked is obviously inspired by Blizzard's Warcraft series with a bit of Pokmon peppered in for seasoning, but the development team has created a series that feels familiar yet seems like its own design.In the game, you control either an army of Humans or Beasts and set out on a series of missions to eliminate the opposing race from the land forever. To succeed in your task, you'll have to control a group of Grunts, Archers, Knights, and Dragons, protecting your fortress while attacking your enemies. Both races are equally balanced  the only differences are in what the creatures look like as well as in the different structured missions unique to the race. Throughout the game, the map is covered in a ~Fog of War~ -- a group of question mark blocks that will reveal the land underneath when your troops have wandered near them.  This protects the enemy troops from prying eyes so you don't know exactly what he's doing.Grunts are used to harvest lumber for building structures and gold for recruiting troops; Archers are long-distance attackers with weak armor; Knights are up-close attackers with decent shielding. Dragons are a definite coup if you can find them in the game map  they can fly over any terrain and attack from a distance, they have excellent armor, can only be attacked by archers and defensive towers, and can wipe out a single unit in just three hits of his fire breath. They can only be found by finding eggs on the current map  and they can only be used when you send the baby dragon back to your main structure. The other handicap: you can only have one dragon on the map at any one time...but you can have other dragons in reserve if you find them. The biggest challenge was getting the somewhat complex interface of a real-time strategy game squashed onto the tiny Game Boy Color screen without feeling cramped. And I feel that Bits Studios did a fantastic job with the control scheme  you'll never leave the main screen to tell your Grunts to build a farm, castle, or guard tower, since the interface is done via a small set of icons at the bottom of the screen. You can easily choose which units to purchase with a simple tap of the A or B button, as well as group troops together by the standard cursor dragging over the units. The only thing that's really needed is a smaller overhead map so you can keep track of your off-screen units.  I'm sure that was in the design but was scrapped to keep the interface as streamlined as possible  it's an item that's missed but isn't entirely necessary.The game is broken down into more than thirty tasks to complete between the two races, and if you sat down and played the game all the way through you'd be looking at more than 25 hours at least. Some missions are shorter than others, but the later levels you could be looking at playing the mission for at least an hour. And then, there are the multiplayer missions  myself and the Pokmon of the Day guy played a few missions that lasted for a total of a couple hours at least. Aside from Pokmon and Tetris, Warlocked will probably have the most time spent on a single Game Boy Color cartridge. And that's a darn  good value.The thing that makes Warlocked a unique real-time strategy game is its introduction of Wiz characters. There are more than 27 Wiz characters that can be rescued and used in any mission  but the only way you're going to find all of the Wiz characters is if you locate someone else with a copy of Warlocked. At the beginning of the game the computer randomly chooses which Wiz characters will appear in your missions, and just because you found one type of Wiz in one mission doesn't mean a friend won't find the same Wiz in the same location. Wiz characters are very powerful entities with abilities specific to their name. A ChickenWiz, for example, can turn enemy units into chickens which makes them easier to attack. A CrowWiz can turn a friendly unit into a crow, which can then fly around the map quickly to reveal as much of the unexplored terrain as possible. The SweatWiz, my favorite, will cause all your grunt units to work double time  this will build up your lumber and gold reserves much more quickly and give you the upperhand early in the game. The Wiz characters are very weak when attacked, so the best strategy is to keep an eye on them when you bring them out into battle. The Wiz characters also help when you're playing in Vs. mode  which ever Wiz you rescued in the one player missions can be brought out in the multiplayer maps.The game also keeps the variety going by offering incentives to continue playing. The only way you're going to play the Vs. link cable mode is to find the multiplayer maps hidden across the single player mission maps. What's more, there are mini-games to find as well  so far, I've found a poker game and a slide puzzle game that can be accessed in the Extras menu at the beginning of the game...and there are a few more to find. These hidden treats really push you forward and make you stay on the current mission until you've uncovered all the hidden parts of the map.There are problems with this portable real-time strategy game, mostly having to do with the AI of your troops. The game doesn't handle ~pathing~ as well as it should  pathing is the term used for the route each troop takes when going from its starting point to the point you told it to go. In Warlocked, you'll spend a lot of time correcting pathing errors  attacking troops will break off and wander in weird remote locations until you tell them to go in another spot and then to the point you originally told them to go. Sometimes Grunts won't deposit their gold or lumber because they can't find the gap between your guarding troops, so they'll walk back and forth until you come up to clear a better spot for them. The pathing problems are minor, but since they truly affect your strategies they're definitely worth mentioning.In the game you can stockpile surviving troops into a separate database, and they can be grouped into ~armies~ that can be sent over to another Game Boy Color through the infra-red port for an automatic rock/paper/scissors-type battle. This mini-game isn't really a selling point to Warlocked and we barely touched it after playing it a couple times. It's a nice addition but definitely not something you'll be playing as much as the normal missions.I'm also not entirely crazy about the art style used in the game, but that's just a matter of taste. And since I can barely draw a stick figure, I'd hate to insult the game's artist just because I don't like the way the full-screen Wiz portraits are drawn.But as I mentioned above, the game really shines in the multiplayer mode  Warlocked never misses a beat when it has to keep track of two different armies on two separate systems.  Even in single player mode I'm totally impressed with how Bits Studios got so many large sprites to move on the screen with only a tiny bit of slowdown. I've only seen one or two instances of sprite flicker when six units got on the same horizontal line. All this and slick, digitized speech when you tell a unit to go from one position to the next.Warlocked is the answer  real-time strategy games are possible on the Game Boy Color. And what's more important, real-time strategy games are fun on the Game Boy Color. The game isn't a replacement for the PC RTS games, but instead open the door for other games of the genre to join the portable world. I don't expect to see many of this type of game to show up on the Color system  but the genre will definitely make a splash on the Game Boy Advance. Warlocked is a fantastic portable game with tons of replay value, and may actually persuade you to pick up an additional copy just to play a friend.", "date": "Jul 25, 2000"}
