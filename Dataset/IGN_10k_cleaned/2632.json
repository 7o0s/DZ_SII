While it's widely known that EA Sports always does a World Cup title the year of the big event, seeing a copy so soon with the extra power of the PS2 was an added bonus. And while many of the die hard soccer fans out there may be scratching their heads in wonderment deciding between the two versions of EA Sports best selling series, an absolute answer to that question remains hazy. Do I go with features or presentation?   While the ~mood~ differences between the two are almost as drastic as night and day, choosing one over the other was more difficult than we first thought. There are clearly advantages that each holds over the other one, with a soccer play engine so similar that a normally crucial aspect is almost rendered moot. It's a difficult comparison to say the least, and one we tackled with smiles on our faces.   Gameplay  The power meter that was introduced for passing in MLS 2002 is back in a big way. The most strategic addition to the slightly aged soccer engine in years, the need to aim your pass and determine how hard you want to do so makes such a big difference in terms of skill, that you'll want to forget the old system entirely.   Closer to the real passing game than anything else on the market, the 85-minute possession domination of yesteryear is definitely a thing of the past. If you want to excel in the teamwork arena this time around, you'll have to do the work yourself? no more CPU assists. And though veteran FIFA players may find the lack of ~auto~ a tad distracting, a couple of games through the motions and it's a piece of cake.   If you played Electronic Arts previous FIFA Major League Soccer title, then you're already familiar with the rest of the general gameplay nuances. Shooting the ball into the net is still pressure sensitive and dependant on how hard or long you press the circle button, and the weighty ball physics still seem to make the black and white stick to your foot a little too easily. Luckily, the Martian-like atmosphere that surrounds your target orb has been toned down a notch and allows for a slightly more realistic feel.    Change-mongers will be happy to note that there have been multiple modifications and enhancements since FIFA MLS 2002 and include one-key headers and bicycle kicks. Dubbed ~Air Play Shots~ by the developers, the easy to punt spectaculars that we demand are back and a hell of a lot easier to perform than they were six months ago.   Additionally, every player in the game (based on their real-life World Cup counterparts) has special moves and abilities that can be exploited via the shoulder triggers. Curving your shot naturally based on individual characteristics or other signature player strengths help define that extra feel of realism, and the NFL Blitz-like fire that surrounds the soccer ball on a powerful shot is surprisingly non-cheesy. All in all, World Cup is a slightly more rounded playing experience.   Features  FIFA Soccer 2002 had over 500 teams, 16 leagues, and 10 tournaments with complete seasons and unlockable goodies via the reward system. It was easily one of the deepest, most well thought of feature sets ever produced for a sports title and stands to this day as the one to beat. Unfortunately, World Cup can't compete.   Boned down to a simple two-mode game, your choices are limited. With Friendly Play and the World Cup Tournament your only options from the start, there isn't much reward for playing all the way to the end. Beat the World Cup, get an All-Stars team, and that's all she wrote -- with the only option to go back and do it all over again. Rewarding an experience as it may be, the precedence set by FIFA 2002 was so high, that a list as barren as this one seems almost insulting.    Standard editing options like rearranging your formations and strategies or manipulating your starting lineup is a synch. While added features like wide screen television support, injury toggle, referee strictness, and variable camera angles are in there too. Best of all however is the inclusion of a bottom-screen radar that will let you learn the positions of your teammates at all times regardless of their positions onscreen.   Perhaps set up to be more of an expansion pack than a true sequel, 2002 FIFA World Cup is loaded with videos, including a couple not found in the GameCube version. The two in question entitled ~John Motson~ and ~Spheriks~ are interesting additions indeed with an analysis of the world cup by way of 'Match of the Day' co-host John Motson, and a full-length animated short starring the official FIFA mascots. The other videos are made up of behind the scenes documentaries and a season preview of upcoming EA Sports games. Cool features sure, but couldn't the extra disc space have been used to throw in a couple more features?   Graphics  One of the most immediate differences you'll notice between the World Cup and Major League Soccer versions of FIFA are the crowds. Brought to life in mad raving glory by a sea of colorful signs, flags, and towels, the frantic mass of people are the epitome of convincing. Streamers, confetti, and more consistent camera flashes are a big advantage over MLS, and the excitement captured by the crowd's liveliness pays off in spades.   New animations have been added as well. With better stumbling and pushing motions thrown in for good measure, the slightly more fluid visuals are an obvious baby step upward in the right direction. Strangely the grass textures don't look quite as realistic as they did the last time we the visited EA stadium, and has a strikingly colorful look comparable to the old Virtua Striker series on Dreamcast. Player faces, hairstyles, authentic jerseys, and other little details help tie it all together and create a near-definitive soccer experience.   Sound  The opening theme rocks. Performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the excellent sweeping score really captures the heart and soul of the world's most popular sport. Played once again as the teams take the field of battle, we're convinced that the song should be released as a single and replayed here in the offices in our most triumphant game beating victories.   Audio effects are superlative also, with a healthy dose of chanting, name calling, and good old-fashioned cheering to pump the players up and keep the action going. With announcing chores handled once again by distinguished Mister Motson and play-by-play man Andy Gray, the television like package is a top-notch journey for the ear.Not the deep experience to be found with last fall's FIFA Soccer 2002 MLS, the slightly better gameplay engine from 2002 FIFA World Cup is overshadowed by a lack of features. An exhilarating soccer experience to be sure, the improved shooting engine and extra animations are huge bonuses for football diehards. Casual soccer fans however may want to pass this one up in favor of the fuller, more rewarding experience in MLS. Wannabe keepers and midfielders though could find the quest for the most prestigious team title in the world a little too tempting to ignore.", "date": "Apr 23, 2002"}
