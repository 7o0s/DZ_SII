His first appearance was on the NES, where the basics that would define the series were established. But Bomberman truly matured when Hudson, the company that created him, debuted its own videogame hardware -- the TurboGrafx-16.   An early release for the system, simply called ~Bomberman,~ re-imagined the character with the short, out-of-proportion design with the white bucket helmet that we recognize today. It was a radical departure from the first attempts to display the character in artwork -- he'd previously always been depicted as a kind of blue-suited Samus Aran (even though the in-game graphics of the NES title looked much closer to the ~new~ art style). Cuteness worked where realism didn't, and from 1990 on the B-Man has (with one unfortunate Xbox exception) been kept in stylized anime form.   Bomberman '93, was the follow-up to the original TurboGrafx games and brought with it the classic multiplayer blasting design that you've probably had the opportunity to play several times now.   You and up to four friends are thrown into a square-shaped arena filled with obstacles. You have the power to lay bombs at your feet that, after a few seconds, explode into horizontal and vertical lines of flame. The object of the game is to be the last Bomberman standing, clearing enough of the obstacles out of the way with your own bombs to get into range of your friends, then trapping them in a corner, laying another explosive, and kissing them goodbye.   The simple ~Battle Royale~ formula was so successful in its first few outings that even modern Bomberman releases do little to change it, and are scorned if they try. It's one of the best and most classic multiplayer contests gaming has to offer -- it's nice to see it debuting here with the Wii.   Besides the classic multiplayer mode, Bomberman '93 hosts a lengthy single-player adventure. Over 50 levels take you through a variety of worlds, where the gameplay focus is on eliminating all of the enemies in a room and then finding the hidden exit portal before time runs out. A boss battle comes at the end of every planet, as Bomberman blasts around his solar system on the trail of his dark and evil twin.Bomberman '93 is a great little game. It supports the multiplayer, party-gaming focus that the series has always been known for, and the single player mode is still fun and challenging. In short, it's an excellent representation of Bomberman's early days that's certainly worth a look.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
