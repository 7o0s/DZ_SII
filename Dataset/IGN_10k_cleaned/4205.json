Project Gotham Racing did the same, initiating even more gamers with its improved gameplay and graphics. Project Gotham Racing 2, we're convinced, will repeat history once again, this time garnering even more attention and praise than ever before. This game is good - real good.GameplayProject Gotham Racing 2 is a racing game but not in the traditional sense. Yeah, you race cars against other cars, but there's so much more. The most significant variable added to the standard racing equation is Kudos. Kudos points are earned by driving with ~style.~ This includes powersliding, catching air, driving clean races and drafting behind opponents. These Kudos points are more than just extra point however: many goals require you to finish with a specified number of Kudos. This forces the player to drive fast and drive pretty at the same time. It's this balancing nature of PGR 2 that gives it much of its magic.You'll also have to be careful to not lose Kudos either. If you hit a wall or cone with enough pressure, you'll lose the Kudos currently in your point buffer (losing Kudos for hitting other cars has been removed). You have be to especially careful when trying to create a huge combo. Combos? Yep. After earning Kudos points, the player has a couple of seconds to perform another move, adding to the Kudos total and also adding in a multiplier. By continuously performing stylish skids throughout a race, you can, in theory, have an entire race be one huge combo. That in turn means a huge Kudos score. Trying to create big combos is just as addicting as in games like Tony Hawk, only it's a lot harder in PGR 2. It's also more rewarding; you'll feel like you really accomplished something the first time you combo an entire race.Strategy Guide Available! Race to the Finish!Put the pedal to the floor as we school you on earning Kudos for every track. Master the asphalt with our expert guide.Get The Guide | See Other GuidesThe single player game is broken up into three sections: Kudos World Series, Arcade Racing, and Time Attack. The Kudos World Series is the meat of the game. Races are categorized by car types (i.e. Compact Sports Series, Sport Utility Series, etc.) with a select group of car models being available in each category. Within each section there are a number of different races which are then broken into five difficulty/medal levels. From Hot Lap to One on One to Street Race, there's a wide variety of race types to choose from. Our favorite has to be the Cone Challenge where players have a limited amount of time to finish a lap while scoring a set number of Kudos points. It's addicting and fun, and the learning curve is just right.  Finishing all of the races in a series will then unlock the next series and so on and so on. Also, as your Kudos Rank - your total Kudos points - increases, you earn Kudos tokens which are used to purchase new cars. Oftentimes you'll have enough tokens to purchase the best car of the bunch making some of the races easier, but sometimes a particular car will be better for a certain race, making your car selection an important part of the racing process. For the most part, though, the car with the overall best stats will get the job done for the any medal below platinum.The difficulty level in PGR 2 has been toned down a bit. Before, it was hard to unlock some of the later races and cars because of the steep difficulty curve. In PGR 2, players can complete all the races in a series at the easiest difficulty level and unlock the next series. This lets gamers of all skill levels see almost all of the tracks and cars in the game and is a much appreciated feature.  The car selection in PGR 2 is diverse and the game retains the holy Ferrari license that few other games have. While not as extensive of a collection as a game like Gran Turismo, the car selection has a little of bit of everything, and overall feels complete. There are compact cars such as the MINI Cooper and Ford Focus; there are SUVs like the BMW X5 and the super slick Porsche Cayenne Turbo; there are the small and unique-looking roadsters like the Vauxhall VX220 and the AC 427 MKIII; there are the ~Ultimate~ cars such as the Saleen S7 and the TVR Cerbera Speed 12. Just about every car class is included in the game so for most car fans, the selection should be more than enough. We still wish we could choose any color for any car as opposed to being limited by the pre-selected colors, but whatever.PGR 2 is an arcade racer so don't expect realistic physics. But that's not to say that each and every car doesn't feel different. They do, and exactly how you would expect them to feel; SUVs are heavier and harder to slide, while a Nissan Skyline GT-R is super responsive and can powerslide like no other. So yeah, the game is easy to pick up and play like any good arcade racer should be, but there's enough realism there to differentiate each and every car series and type.Each game in the series has included locales based on real world locations. This time around we get such exotic places as Barcelona, Florence, Chicago, Washington, and Hong Kong just to name a few. Tracks consist of roadways that have been partitioned off Ridge Racer-style, with roadblocks determining where you can or cannot go. The different world locations offer different city architectures, making some tracks wide and straight while others extremely narrow and full of 90 degree turns. Also, some tracks are extremely short while others are almost too long. Almost. We found the track designs very well designed and varied. Some may not like the short-distance nature of the tracks, nor the fact that the races take place in claustrophobic city streets, but then this game is not made for those folk.One of the problems with the past PGR game has been the AI. Unfortunately, the problem still persists. The AI cars will follow the set line like their life depended on it, making for predictable and easy races. The converse can be true also, especially on the harder difficulties, where a race is almost impossible to win because the CPU races the line flawlessly. Sometimes too hard, and sometimes too easy, the races that contain AI racers are the least fun of the bunch. We found that we enjoyed the single-player races the most, such as the Cone Challenge, Hot Lap, and Timed Runs. OnlineRacing games are made for online play and PGR 2 knows it. If you don't feel like playing split-screen (up to four players) or hooking up system link (up to eight consoles), you can hop on Xbox Live and race with up to 8 people total. You can choose the race type (Exhibition or Kudos), turn collisions on or off (only in Exhibition), set the city, route, laps, time of day, and weather, and restrict whichever car classes you want. Online play was incredibly smooth and responsive, with no noticeable lag. Real world performance may vary, but we did not experience any problems whatsoever.But the online functionality in PGR 2 goes beyond simply racing. Now, if you have Xbox Live, you are asked to sign in before you start playing. The reason is because the game will always show you real-time leader boards for each and every race. Just seeing other players' ranks makes the motivation factor for outdoing them in the game blow through the roof. Better yet, after a race is completed, a ghost of your race is uploaded to the servers. That means you can go to any race, see who's on top, and then watch their ghost to see how they scored those 10,000 Kudos. Of course, you can then attempt to try the race yourself and get an even higher score. I don't know how many times I saw my friend one spot above me on a number of races. I was determined to place higher and would race the same track over and over until I came out on top. This always-Live system of showing the real-time scoreboards and uploading ghosts is brilliant and should set the standard for all other online racing games.PGR 2 will also have its share of downloadable content, most notably new cars. The car showcase area of the game has three rooms that are empty, and are available exclusively for Xbox Live cars We've seen some of the cars that are coming and they are sweet.  Miscellaneous GoodiesPGR 2 is a great racing game at its core, but it also contains some features that make it even better. First is the car showcase. When entering the showcase, players will be put in a car museum of sorts where they can walk around in first-person and look at each and every car in the game, whether they've unlocked it or not. You can even take the car for a test drive on an empty course if you like. It's a simple addition but it adds that much more to an already excellent game.Another great feature in PGR 2 is the Garage. In the garage you can view all of the cars you've unlocked. Doesn't sound that spectacular, does it? It shouldn't. The real reason you want to go into the garage is walk around in first-person mode. Tucked away in the garage is an old arcade cabinet you can walk up to. Press a button and you can play a game known as Geometry Wars. A simple shooting game that uses Robotron-like controls, Geometry Wars is absolutely a blast to play. And the graphics, while nothing more than simple lines and colors, will still amaze when you see the all of the insane particles flying every which way. The best part is, the high scores are retained and - if you have Xbox Live - ranked against other players, just like your Kudos scores are in the regular game. This is one mini-game that is not to be missed!GraphicsVisually, racing games have come a long way over the last few years and PGR 2 is proof of that. Being a racing game, of course the car models are superb. Each looks just like it should, though most racing games have this ground covered by default. What's cool about the cars, though, are the little animated drivers in them. As you steer left or right, you'll see the anonymous driver do the same. He'll even change gears at the appropriate times. This isn't really a new feature - it was in both the first PGR and even in Metropolis Street Racer -- but we still really like the attention to the detail.What PGR 2 has that not many racers do is damage modeling. Each and every car will dent, have its mirrors hang by a thread, and have trunks and hoods pop open and shut as it bangs and hits the walls. The damage isn't realistic, though - there's only so much a car will deform. On top of that, it takes some major hits to cause damage at all. There's also no degrade in performance. But does any of this matter? Not really. Again, it's relatively subtle (you often don't see your dents until the race is over) but we like that it's there.  The tracks also look splendid, featuring sharp textures and accurate modeling. The road is bump-mapped like the first game, and the lighting is on point, recreating day, night and dusk with an eerie realism. There were a few instances where we noticed some strange texture swapping, but it's barely noticeable if you're not looking for it. Weather effects (rain) also look good, accurately conveying the gray depressing mood of those wet winter days.From a technical standpoint, there's really not much to gripe about. The game moves at a solid framerate, the cars and tracks look fantastic, and there are touches of cool effects (bump-mapped roads, soft glow of light that reflects of the cars' roofs) everywhere. The problem is that the tracks feel so desolate and lifeless - it's just you and road. It's just like the scene inOpen Your Eyes where the lead walks around an empty city, wondering where all signs of life are. Some areas are a bit more animated, like Yokohama with its birds flying through the sky, or Washington DC and its falling leaves, but on a whole, the tracks feel a bit sterile and dead.Another complaint we have is the lack of weather conditions. Sure, there are some rainy tracks, but where's the snow, sleet or anything else for that matter? Also lacking are the times of day to race. With only day and night, the choices are obviously limited. But we're nitpicking here, really. PGR 2 looks great, period. Next time we'd like to see some more environmental interaction and diversity, but as is, this game is still one of the best-looking racers on any console.  SoundAs is almost standard with any quality racer these days, the engine sounds for every car sound great. We've don't really know what some of the cars in the game sound like, but we're going to assume the game is accurate in its portrayals. Being a racing game, the sounds in the game ultimately come down to engines roaring and tires squealing. In these respects, PGR 2 sounds as good as any other racing game. The menu screens and such have some generic music tracks that get the job done, but it's all really trivial at best.As far as licensed music goes, PGR 2 has an excellent selection. In fact, PGR 2 may overtake Wakeboarding Unleashed for having the best licensed music soundtrack. And that's not an easy thing to do, us being such big fans of Pavement, the Pixies and Love and Rockets. PGR 2 has a wide variety of genres from hip-hop to indie rock to electronica, and the person in charge of the music should get a medal and cookie for choosing such great bands as Aerogramme, the Black Heart Procession, Princess Superstar (so hot live), the Flaming Lips, Trail of Dead, and even Denton-based Baboon, an old favorite of mine from my home state. Of course, even if you don't like any of the artists included in the game you can always rip and create your own custom soundtrack. And yes, you can mix and match from your own soundtrack with songs from the game to create a custom playlist. Our biggest beef with the music is that there's no easy way to fast forward through songs. Also, if a song starts right when you finish a track, the next race will start with the next song rather than continuing from where the last one ended. Again, we're nitpicking but someone's got to do it.Can a racing game be this good? Apparently so. Project Gotham Racing 2, while not drastically different from previous iterations of the game, is quite possibly the best racer on the Xbox. Again, the game is an arcade racer at heart completely devoid of detailed car stats and tuning options so those looking for the next Gran Turismo should try something more along the lines of Sega GT Online. PGR 2 is a beautiful game that handles amazingly well, sounds just as good, and redefines what gamers should expect from an online racer. The game's seamless integration of Xbox Live is simply wonderful, and the online play is fast and furious. And then there's Geometry WarsWe're still waiting on more lively environments and more realistic AI, and we miss the ability to set our console's internal clock to the game's, but as is, PGR 2 is the premier racing game for the Xbox. Buy it.Highly recommended.", "date": "Nov 18, 2003"}
