Hands On Mobile's Mind Maze has been tied to last summer's blockbuster flick X-Men: The Last Stand, and fans of the movie and the mutant superheroes may wonder why -- especially after they've played it.   Mind Maze is essentially an updated version of the classic game QiX.  Use either your 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys or the directional pad on your phone to move a blinking ~X-cursor~ along the board.  Each movement leaves the trail of a yellow line, and when you've enclosed an entire area it will disappear, revealing a portion of a photograph from the major motion picture production X-Men: The Last Stand.  How excited you are to reveal these images probably has a lot to do with what you thought of the movie.   Your path will be hindered by ~psionic defenses~ that rove continuously across the board.  If they collide with your X-cursor or its lines, you'll lose a life.  Luckily, you only have to expose at least 75% of the playing field to reveal the picture beneath.   Aside from the movie still, the game attempts to connect with X-Men mythology by claiming that the playing board is Cerebro, Professor Xavier's telepathic mutant-finding machine.  X-fans may wonder why Professor X designed his own machine with roving psionic defenses, but whatever.  We all know the X-connection is just an excuse to repackage a golden oldie by tying it to a popular property.   The game is simple but catchy.  If you've never played QiX (as I hadn't), you might be baffled by the game's instructions, which includes such carefully crafted wording as, ~When [the X-cursor's] line encloses an area, the background beneath where the boss is not in will be revealed.~  Huh?  Kind of sounds like it was translated from English into another language, and then back into English via Babel Fish.   Mind Maze only offers ten levels, but the degree of difficulty advances with each board.  If you're a puzzle fan, you'll want to match wits with those tricky psionic defenses.  X-Men fans might have preferred a tie-in game that allows them to actually play their favorite heroes, but at least Mind Maze doesn't offer another unsatisfying button-masher.  It's not exceptionally brilliant or engaging, but it offers a nice enough diversion for fans of tricky puzzlers.  Mind Maze will likely please old-school fans of Qix.  The game play is almost ridiculously simple, if quickly repetitious, but the game has a few challenges to keep things occasionally lively.  X-Men fans may scratch their heads, however, wondering what any of this has to do with their favorite merry mutants.", "date": "Jan 22, 2007"}
