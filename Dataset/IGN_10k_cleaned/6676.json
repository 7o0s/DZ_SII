The game originally began its life as a Nintendo 64 version of Battle Sport. After looking at the games already available, 3DO decided that a tank game in the line of Tokyo Wars would be just the right thing for a console flooded by racers and ~wacky~ platformers.The StoryBattle Tanx can be described as ~Road Warrior~ with tanks. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where women have become somewhat of an endangered species. After a plague -- a virus that attacks the double-X chromosome, the females of a species -- unleashed from the jungles of South America makes its way into the air, women begin dying by the thousands. Governments work quickly to establish quarantine zones, safe-houses for women who haven't been infected by the virus, but many blame the government for the outbreak to begin with. Before long martial law is established and civil wars break out. But wars aren't fought over territory or money. They are fought over women. Eventually the world is thrown into thermonuclear war and vast cities are destroyed. Surviving women are looked upon as if they are Gods. Named Queen-lords, they are protected at all costs by individual tribes of men. This decidedly cheesy premise sets the stage for countless tank battles between rivaling gangs and never-ending destruction.GameplayJump in your tank and destroy a certain number of enemies, capture a queen, or make it to the other side. There are three types of tanks. The standard M1A1 Abrams is used for most of the action. It has a movable turret (unless you go with the easy, but crappy standard controller setting) and can flatten objects such as cars and small buildings without major problems. A much speedier MotoTank is also used in certain missions, and players can also at times switch to a massive railgun, The Goliath. The latter can also be knocked off its rails and used for attack. Additionally, gamers can play the game through two views -- behind the back, and from the tank hatch.Naturally, most of BattleTanx fun is derived from mindless destruction -- and the game definitely succeeds on this level. You can take down certain structures, such as damaged buildings, run over signs and even take down telephone poles. In fact, the development team has designed each city in a way that actually encourages exploration through destruction. For example, if a building blocks the way to a near-by road, players can easily blast right through the building and move on. Destroying structures also presents you with a variety of power-ups that become increasingly important in your battle against an overwhelming enemy force:Star: Whenever you destroy a tank, you get this random ammo or armor power-up.Health: Fix your tank when it's damaged.Ammo: Get 30 shells for your primary weapon.Shield: Causes enemy fire to reflect off your tank.Bonus Poits: Adds 1000 points to your score.Radar: Activates a radar sensor on your HUD showing all the tanks.Extra Tank: Duh.Swarmer Missiles: Fires three destructive missiles.Grenades: These bounce off obstacles and cause lots of damage.Guided Missile: Drool. This puppy can be steered after you fire it. The camera than switches to ~missile cam~ and lets you rocket around the levels. Very cool.Mines: Nasty little explosive traps.Laser: A high energy pulse that does great aounts of damage.Cloaking: Makes your tank invisible to enemies (including rader).Nuke: Causes an ~Independence Day~ blast that levels everything. Cool effect, but it can also harm you.Gun Buddy: These automated gun turrets can be deployed anywhere to confuse and attack your opponents.While the destruction and the weapons selection is cool, the gameplay in the one-player mode suffers from two problems. First, there is an obvious lack of variety. Sure, the objectives change from level to level, but it's basically the same type of gameplay over and over again. It will quickly remind you of old-school shooting games from the 16-bit days, where you basically just move on forward and take out wave after wave of enemy attackers. The second problem is the one-player mode's length. Seasoned gamers can beat all 17 missions in one day, which makes it the perfect rental game -- if it hadn't been for one major factor:MultiplayerIf you're like us and you often get together with friends to drink a few beers and annoy your significant others with hours of GoldenEye or Turok 2 action, then this game is simply a must-have. There are four different battle modes for up to four players:Deathmatch Mode: The first player to achieve seven kills wins.Battlelord Mode: An excellent twist on ~capture the flag.~ Get your opponent's Queenlord and bring her back to your camp.Annihilation Mode: The last player with tanks remaining on the battlefield wins.Family Mode: Simplified pick-ups (you automatically equip the latest item) and single-button firing.Before jumping into the game, players select their favorite gang (this also determines what type of power-up you start off with), then decide what team they want to be on. You can split up in any formation, such as two-on-two, three-on-one, and so on. The best action is to be had with evenly matched two-on-two battles. In addition to human players, you can also activate bots (computer-controller drones). You can even play alone against the computer this way.The amount of fun that can be had in the multiplayer mode is on par with the best N64 has to offer. Pick-ups like cloaking devices, gun buddies, and remote missiles make for hours of entertainment. Imagine cloaking the fast motortank and speeding right into your opponent's fortress. You grab the QueenLord (which makes you visible to everyone on the radar screen) and all hell breaks loose. Your buddies are trying to hunt you down with all they got when you turn around, and while driving backwards drop a nuclear device. Watch the anguish on your friends' faces as you race to escape from the nuclear blast and bring the Queen home. Seriously, folks. Multiplayer BattleTanx is great.GraphicsGraphics, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. Framerates are pretty good at all times, but the game's textures are on the blurry side, giving the game an overall muddy look. Some cool explosions, but lighting effects (even simple pre-lighting effects) are sorely missed. 3DO seems to have put a lot of time into creating the hokey background story and drew up comic book style images that accompany the oodles of text in-between stages. Given the limitations of the cart format, this is a decent, if unimpressive alternative. Overall, the game looks like a first-generation title with lots of fog and too few enemy variations.SoundIf you have a subwoofer and you love your neighbors, turn it down. Things blow up almost every second, and they do so with lots of rumbling and appropriate blast noises. Sound effects are pretty good throughout, but the music is nasty as can be. 3DO mixed midi rock with a little bit of Wagner, but the samples are severely lacking. Think '80s Casio synth. Good thing the music can be turned off. The complete absence of voice samples is also disappointing. It would have been cool to hear the radio chatter of your team mates or your opponents during gameplay (even if it was in a foreign language). That would have added more of the ~war feel~ 3DO was going for.Battle Tanx supports the Memory Pak and the Rumble Pak. Only one page is required to save your game.I've seen some pretty mediocre ratings of BattleTanx in the gaming press, which really surprised me. Sure, the graphics are nothing to shout about, and the one-player mode is a one-day kind of a deal -- but anyone who has played the multiplayer modes will have to admit that this game delivers the goods. Not since GoldenEye have I had this much fun blowing my friends to Hell and back. It's obvious 3DO concentrated on making the multiplayer modes the center of this game. You've got team play, capture the flag, death match, tons of pickups, bots, customizable power-up regen, base defense, or ammo limitations, as well as a variety of controller setups. Speaking of which, the standard setting is horrible. Switch the game to arcade (or the two more complex settings) to gain independent turret control. Only then can you strafe sideways to effectively take out the oversized Goliath tanks.A word of caution: If you primarily play your games alone, don't buy BattleTanx. There are plenty of N64 games that offer more fun for one player. This game is a multiplayer game. To make things less confusing, I suggest 3DO sell it with three more controllers and sixer of beer.", "date": "Jan 16, 1999"}
