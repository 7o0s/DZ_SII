The big difference between the releases of Quake I and Quake II is that shortly after Quake II comes out, Quake III will be released as well, making Q2 look like the two year old game that it is.   Despite the fact that Unreal has been out for a year and that Quake III Test is already burning up LANs everywhere, Quake II is still a damn good game. In a nutshell, id managed to perfectly refine their formula for first person shooters and the result is the version of Quake II that has been ported to the Mac. It is important to note that the version of Q2 that we're getting is not the same one that PC players got the first time around. The first Q2 release was painfully buggy, had poor network code and no dedicated death match levels, and was missing obvious features like being able to see an opponent's weapon, features that had been around for years in games like Marathon Infinity. Gradually, id remedied all these problems, culminating in the final release, Quake II 3.20, which is what we're getting straight out of the door. That isn't to say there won't be patches to Mac version, but it does mean that Mac Q2 will always have the same features and be network compatible with the PC version.   Game play is pure distilled violence. And it is a riot to play. The single player levels are gothic masterpieces of dark corridors, tortured bodies, expansive rooms, lava pools, and the most wicked looking baddies this side of a Clive Barker movie. The multi-player game refines the violence into a free-for-all death match that still goes basically unchallenged as the pinnacle of network gaming. Gunned down enemies explode into chunky gore with flies buzzing over the carcasses. Clearly, this game is aimed at an older audience and deserves every bit of its Mature rating. Evidence of this is in the models and skins you can choose for multi-player gaming. Just check out the ~Crack Whore~ model and skin you can play as, pictured on the right.    On the PC, Q2 was written to take advantage of every ounce of speed that a computer could muster. Logicware, the company that ported the game from the PC to the Mac seems to have managed to extract a similar level of optimization for PowerPC computers. The game will play on 603 machine, though at low frame rates, and plays beautifully on the omnipresent iMac. The only technical flaw in the game is that it doesn't seem to respond to keyboard input as quickly as it should, at it seems to have a problem when multiple keys are pressed (strafing left, moving forward, firing and activating quad damage, for example.)   One of the most touted aspects of Quake II is the graphics, which look good largely because they take advantage of OpenGL 3D acceleration. The game will play on a computer without hardware 3D acceleration, but to really appreciate Quake II, it should be played with a Voodoo card or, preferably, on ATI's new Rage 128 series of cards. Out of the box, Quake II supports the Rage Pro and II video chips found in iMacs and all G3 computers in addition to the Rage 128 card found in Blue & White tower G3s. If you have a Voodoo 1 or 2 card, you'll want to install the MesaQuake3D driver and the latest Mesa MacQ2refgl file from Logicware (look on our downloads page for the latest version.) You'll also need to have Apple's OpenGL installed, which comes with the game. Quake II on a Voodoo based card is using what are, essentially, beta versions of a variety of drivers so the game isn't quite as stable as it is on a Rage 128.   As good as the single player game is, many people are going to be primarily interested in the multi-player game. Fortunately, because there is feature parity between the PC and Mac version of the game, Mac Quake II players can jump onto any Quake II server and play against PC opponents, or play on a LAN with a mix of Mac and PC players. Even over a 56k modem, the networking code seems to hold up, keeping game based lag times down.   The first person shooter genre on the Mac has always been a crowded one. That, combined with the immanent release of Quake III Arena, almost begs the question, why bother with a port of Quake II? The answer is simple, it's great fun and is going to sell like gang busters. Even if you're planning to buy Quake III Arena, pick up Quake II as well because too much Quake is never a bad thing.", "date": "Jun 10, 2002"}
