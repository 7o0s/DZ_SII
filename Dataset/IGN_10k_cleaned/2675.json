The Sum of All Fears combines the outstanding technology of one of my favorite titles with the action and situation of another of my favorite titles. But just saying that Ubi Soft's newest tactical shooter is Ghost Recon meets Rainbow Six isn't quite accurate. The Sum of All Fears is clearly a hybrid benefiting from the strengths of both previous titles, but even without major innovations, The Sum of All Fears is a fantastic first-person tactical shooter full of, if not exhilaration, at least excitement.  Based on the movie based on the book, The Sum of All Fears begins the story of one of Clancy's most popular characters. I won't give away any of the story of the book, movie or game (except to say that the game seems to have a slightly different focus than the novel). Let's just say that through the course of the game you become one of the most elite of all FBI operatives specializing in hostage rescue missions. You did know this was about terrorists and hostages, right?  As with most Rainbow Six-style games, you can go through the entire game without once ever really needing to pay attention to the story. You're given all the details you need to complete the missions within the missions themselves, and the stories that surround these missions only add a slight sense of intensity and involvement to them. But most of the missions do have some strong story telling elements within them that help create a real sense of drama. In fact, the game really does quite well at something I hate in almost all other games: stealth missions. Rather than arbitrarily ending a stealth mission once you get discovered, Sum of All Fears just adds a time limit to missions once you're caught: the alarm sounds, the police will be here in five minutes...that kind of thing.  You'll lead a three-man hostage rescue team through a series of eleven missions. Each time you go out, you'll be part of a larger operation in which you'll have to do most of the work. Thankfully, The Sum of All Fears has an easier learning curve than any of the Rainbow games which is both the title's main strength and main weakness depending on your point of view. It lacks a lot of the versatility and control of the previous games but for some players that merely means that it lacks a lot of the accompanying tediousness or complications.   First and foremost, there's no longer any pre-planning phase. Instead of an extensive pre-planning phase, you'll simply receive a briefing from the ubiquitous John Clark. He outlines your mission objectives and gives you a bit of advice. Why he won't bother to show you a map of your route (or the other teams') is beyond me. I suppose I'm not cleared for such intelligence.  Another big change is that you'll be in charge of just a single fireteam here. It's you and your two back-up guys in charge of your own route. The other fireteams have their own agendas that intersect with (but never really interact with) your own.   Whether this is a strength or weakness of the game again depends on how you played the original Rainbow games. If you're the type to go running straight into a mission with as little preplanning as possible, then you'll appreciate the simplicity of this model. The routes that John Clark prefers you run are laid out for you and you're sure to see lots of interesting action along them. If, on the other hand, you're the type who likes to set up sophisticated cooperation between your teams, you're simply out of luck. The other groups will react to you as you move through the levels. I found that I usually went in a bit slower than the AI controlled teams. It suits me fine and it worked well but if you want action, you need to be aggressive.  John does let you select the kit for your squad but, unfortunately, there's no option to select weapon loadouts for individual soldiers. This can be a real pain, particularly as your default character is the one who carries any of the specialist weapons. In other words, any time you need to bring a sniper along, you have to be the sniper yourself. It makes sense from a story standpoint but limits your options in terms of gameplay.  One of the coolest additions to the game is the squad command feature (which introduces a few of the ideas to be implemented in Raven Shield). Now you can simply point your mouse at a door and command the other members of your squad to take a specific action. They can merely open the door for you, or open it before tossing in a frag or flashbang grenade. For the truly hopeful, you can even order your guys to enter and clear a room for you.  This works really well for two reasons. One, since this game has a stronger central character than any of the previous games, it stands to reason that you'd want to put your teammates in harm's way before stepping in yourself. For the most part, this frees you up to play safety when your guys open the doors. Thankfully, they've taken a page from the CQB manuals and crouch when opening doors, giving you a good chance to shoot over their heads at any threats you see. Just be careful when they stand up again.  What puzzles me is that these options aren't available in multiplayer. There are plenty of opportunities when you need to coordinate with online teammates and don't have the luxury of time to type out your message. If you could just point and click to indicate that you wanted a room grenaded, it would make online matches so much more strategic. Even so, the game's numerous multiplayer options and spaces are a welcome addition. There's nothing terribly new here (except the six new levels, including Red Storm's offices) but it's still a blast.      Visually the game is a close match for Ghost Recon, but instead of representing broad, open areas, the engine is instead tasked with the creation of numerous interiors. (There are sizable open areas around the buildings, but the majority of the action is inside.) Some of the more colossal interiors are really impressive (the hotel, the big freaking stone stair case, etc.) while the small areas seem a bit nondescript. Many of the environmental effects are fantastically convincing. Any one who remembers the wetness of the rain from Ghost Recon should have a sense of what I mean. Each   Another facet of the game that supports the illusion of reality is the sound and the environmental effects (drip, drip) are just part of the story. I remember firing an M16 in a warehouse and being taken back by the utterly convincing metallic echo that the report made. For the record, I've fired a lot of automatic weapons inside tin warehouses before so I know what I'm talking about. The voice work is particularly good, not so much in the briefings (which are good anyway), but in the game itself. The characters say little things now at the start of the mission (like ~I'll try to shoot quietly~ or ~And they say crime doesn't pay?~). As usual for this brand, the music is first rate.  What did you think of The Sum of All Fears?  From a standpoint of interface, Sum of All Fears is well conceived. Standard controls and optional displays mean you can get comfortable with it relatively quickly. I like the Ghost Recon-style interface with the new mini-map replacing the threat indicator. The new square threat indicator that surrounds the map is as useful as the old one but a bit more distracting. It will point out the enemies to you but it's a bit harder to read than it should be.  And given that the enemies in this game are likely to move around, you might want to keep an eye on the threat indicator. The AI of the enemies you face in Sum of All Fears are relatively intelligent. There are still a few poor souls who haven't yet graduated from the ~Don't run past a corner if the guy you're chasing has a gun~ school of terrorism, but they seem able to present a reasonable and highly mobile challenge. As you might guess from the rest of the review, The Sum of All Fears is a good game. It seems a bit light compared to the other titles in the Clancy franchises but even so, that puts it head and shoulders above 80% of the other titles in the genre. With a great engine, a merciless damage model and AI and the cool Clancy atmosphere, Sum of All Fears is definitely enjoyable.The Sum of All Fears is timed to be in store shelves this Friday in time for the movie of course. Red Storm's always been quick to move on their own franchises with expansion packs and sequels springing from the Rainbow Six franchise on a pretty constant basis and it makes sense that a title would come out to coincide with the film. Or maybe the film coincides with the game, I can't keep track.But rather than just being a cash in (not that there's anything wrong with that) it seems as if Sum of All Fears is a bit of an experiment. With Raven Shield using new technology and the Ghost Recon sequel still unannounced, Sum of All Fears allows the team to test their concepts and processes before trying them out in their two hottest franchises. And it does it by bringing them together. Red Storm's games have had some real watersheds and I can't escape the feeling that Sum of All Fears feels like the last hurrah before we move on to bigger and better things for the Ghost and Rainbow teams.But even with all that said, Sum of All Fears is still a blast to play. It's not as exciting as Ghost Recon and certainly not as promising as the upcoming Raven Shield. At $30 it's a good deal and ought to tide you over until you can get your hands on the next big thing in Clancy-themed shooters.", "date": "May 28, 2002"}
