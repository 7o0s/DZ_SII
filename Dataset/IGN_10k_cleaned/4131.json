Either their rushed hack jobs or they better little semblance to the film they're based on. And this genre has not been terribly well-represented on the cellphone front, either -- especially with this summer's X2 and Fury of the Hulk games.  Leave it to Jack Black to turn it around.  Features: Rhythm game Jack Black's digitized mug in yo' face Win free ring tones and screen savers  Based on Jack Black's relatively new movie, School of Rock Audition is an amusing little distraction that scores big because it recognizes all of cellphone gaming's weak points -- limited graphics, audio capabilities, and control -- and smartly works within those boundaries.  The natural genre for a ~School of Rock~ game is rhythm. In School of Rock Audition, you select from one of the two tykes vying for a position in Black's grade school band. To succeed, you must finish four different Simon-esque music mini-games. On instruments like the guitar, piano, and drums, you must follow and complete patterns. it's really quite basic, and if that's all there was to the game, it wouldn't be worth your time and money.  However, it's hard to deny any game that features Jack Black's face, front and center. The Tenacious D front man constantly glares at you while you try to match the patterns. Between rounds, you're treated to quips from the film such as, ~Now, let's make some faces melt.~ Funny.  Better still, though, is that there are real rewards to mastering the game. The further you progress through the audition process, the more goodies you unlock, such as ring tones and screen savers. Nail a game correctly, and you can plaster the art from the film's poster on your screen.  We predict that reward systems like this will become a trend -- a very good trend.  Now, other than JB's face, there ain't much to look at. The screens are just static images of whatever instrument you're playing along with, and the icons are very simple. The audio is kinda slight, just rough estimations of that instrument's sound. It works, but you might expect more out of a game called School of Rock Audition. School of Rock Audition is a very simple, but very well-done game that catapults itself well out of the mediocre packwith the clever download scheme. The unlockables make up for any of the game's fairly acceptable shortcomings. This is a game that knows it's audience, knows it's source materials, and knows its limitations. And because Thumbworks did the homework, the game succeeds brilliantly.", "date": "Nov 7, 2003"}
