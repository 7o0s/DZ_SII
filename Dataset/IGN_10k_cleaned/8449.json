And beer. Lots of beer.   Coincidentally, you may need a drink or two or three to get all the way through the latest Rapala fishing title: Rapala Tournament Fishing, the first fishing game on the Xbox 360. Now we don't condone drinking, but after trudging through the muddy graphics, slim presentation and repetitive gameplay of this stinker, we may change our minds.    Developer Fun Labs makes decent use of the Rapala license as more than 300 Rapala lures are included, including the new 2006 models for the hardcore fans. And for the purists, you can always count on the Original Floating Rapala that Finnish fisherman Lauri Rapala created in 1936 with a shoemaker's knife, a piece of cork, and the foil wrappers of old chocolate bars.    The water is sort of nice. Well, 70 odd years later Rapala is the No. 1 fishing brand on the market. It's too bad this didn't translate into a better videogame experience. While one can argue that fishing may never be a huge hit in game form, it's clear that the game could have been much more with a little bit of effort.    For instance, the game modes -- Tournament, Free Fishing, Arcade Challenge and Time Challenge -- are diminished because the actual fishing gameplay is so repetitive. Simply take your boat to an area with a bunch of fish, equip a lure that your target fish finds tasty, cast, haul in your fish. Keep hauling in fish until the area is depleted, and move on to another spot on the map. Adding time restraints here doesn't improve the experience.   Following prompts isn't fishing. That's not to say that you don't get a little thrill each time you haul in a fish, especially on the higher difficulty settings in which the fish are a bit more selective. After you cast - a simple mechanic performed by holding the left trigger, aiming with the right stick and then hitting the right trigger -- the camera switches to an underwater view. Then you simply reel in the lure, hoping it catches the eye of a predator on the ~swim~ back to the boat. Your HUD will start flashing red when a fish is eying your lure. Here, you simply let the lure sit there, occasionally reeling it in an inch or two to simulate a little bit of life, and the fish will take the bait. Unfortunately for it, it'll also take a hook through the cheek.    The act of actually reeling in the fish is where the action is at. You reel in with the right trigger, release the line with the left trigger and maneuver your rod with the right stick. The only problem is that you basically follow prompts the entire time. The screen will tell you to reel in, release, pull left, pull right, repeat, repeat until the fish is hauled in. Big fish will put up more of a fight and threaten to snap your line, as displayed by a line-strength meter. By ~more of a fight~ we mean there are even more prompts than with the little guys that tend to be reeled straight in without any fight at all. For the first few fish, the novelty is there and I actually pumped a fist when I landed a 30-pound pike. But soon it all wears thin as you repeat this process ad nauseum. At least there are a lot of fish to catch: bass, perch, trout, sunfish, catfish, sturgeon, salmon and our favorite: the black crappie. We're not sure if that's a fish or the unfortunate side affect of burrito night.   When they aren't biting, spin dougnuts around other boats. Aside from some pretty water to look at (weather permitting), Rapala is a visual mess. You can drive straight through some weeds or lily pads and they don't react at all. The framerate sometimes slows to a crawl and there is noticeable pop-in of textures in the distance. There's no create-a-fisherman option either -- only five bland models to choose from. Seriously, there are 300 odd lures, but no option to change your fishing hat?    The sound is a seductive mix of bluegrass and 1980s soft-core porn soundtrack, heavy with the banjo as well as the bow-chica-wow-wow. Apparently, that's fishing music. The ambient noise is nice, however, a soothing blend of chirping birds and biting mosquitoes.    The online options are nonexistent, a shame since fishing could somehow be made into an enjoyable multiplayer game. Biggest fish in 10 minutes? First player to catch something wins? No, instead the only thing to buy online is a map of the California Delta, which would have been an excellent re-creation had the California Delta actually been the Amazon River. It's way off. Well, what can you say? Maybe the tips for what lures to use in the game can be parlayed into some useful fishing knowledge in real life. But really, Rapala is disappointment even for fishing fans. Gamers hoping to find an exciting and unique fishing experience in virtual form aren't happy; hardcore fishing fans hoping to see one of their favorite brands celebrated will be disappointed as well. Rapala can be considered a decent rental for fishing fans, but anyone hoping to purchase it should simply cut bait.", "date": "May 7, 2007"}
