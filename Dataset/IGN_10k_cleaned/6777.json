A year prior to its introduction however, Konami brought beatmania to arcades in Japan, a DJ-inspired game that featured five ~keys~ and a workable turntable. The game and its sequels, beatmania IIDX and beatmania III, have actually seen more mix releases than DDR has, if you can believe it.   Though its history has been highly successful overseas, US gamers have yet to have seen the game outside of import arcades, and its total lack of a console release stateside means that it's essentially unknown over here. But Konami aims to change that with its first PS2 release of the series, the simply-titled beatmania.   While the game takes on the name of the original release, it actually encompasses the seven-key beatmania IIDX release as well, allowing gamers to choose to play either the five or seven key game styles. On top of this, beatmania also tosses in a plethora of customizable play options, like note mirroring, hidden and sudden notes, a challenge difficulty and more.    Like any peripheral-based music game, much of beatmania's success lies on the shoulders of its unique controller. While the beatmania controller isn't perfect in its design, its implementation is great and helps separate beatmania into its own, entirely unique experience.   The controller somewhat resembles a miniature keyboard with a small turntable on one side. The four white keys and three black keys that make up the keyboard segment are what you'll use to match most of the notes on the screen, with the occasional twist of the record to match a side note. The buttons are all made of hard plastic but feel soft to the touch as there's a nice bit of spring to them. The rounded tops help to make playing them quite comfortable. They're also quite responsive, never giving us a problem in our time with the game.   There can be quite a bit of a learning curve as the keys aren't spaced like a keyboard, though your brain will trick you into thinking they should be. Since they're situated on two different rows with spaces between each of the keys, rolling from one to the next isn't as easy as on a keyboard or piano. But, this is by design as it's not actually meant to mimic a keyboard per se, but perhaps rather a percussion sampler or something similar.    Things might have been a bit easier were the keys simply circles instead of rectangles, helping to separate the look of the controller from a keyboard a little more. I found this element of its design to be its weakest point as I constantly struggled between playing the controller like a keyboard with one hand and switching over to two hands in order to play it like it's meant to be played.   Aside from this sticking point, and this is something that may not bother everyone mind you, the unique controller is all-around great. It feels good, the turntable section actually spins and you can even remove and switch around the keyboard section in order to flip the turntable to the other side. Great stuff.   As a note, it is possible to play the game with a standard Dual Shock 2, but honestly, you wouldn't want to. Pick up a second pad if you're planning on some multiplayer action.    As for the gameplay itself, it matches up with basically every other rhythm game on the planet in that ~notes~ scroll down the screen and you simply need to press the corresponding button in time. The turntable part of the controller matches up with the bigger notes to the side of the screen, and twisting the pad in either direction will trigger this. Some sections allow for freeform scratching where you can go to town on the pad, and the game will reward you with bonus points for cool moves.   While the core mechanics behind the game and its customizability are great, the game is marred quite a bit by its less than impressive song list. Spanning over 50 tracks, these are all shortened (around two minutes or so) tunes that encompass both remixes of popular songs, like Britney Spears' Toxic or Funkytown, as well as original hip-hop, drum 'n' bass, trance and techno tracks from various DJs. Unfortunately, almost all of these are pretty bad, with some bordering on being horrid.   It's not just the ~songwriting~ that's the problem here, but how these tracks fit into the style of a rhythm game. Some of these DJs seem to think that randomly placed, off-key notes make for a good song, and not only are they wrong, but playing along with these notes defeats all purposes of a rhythm game since there isn't any. You simply wind up matching the scrolling bars rather than using them as keys for playing the sections of the song you've learned. When it comes down to it, rhythm games aren't supposed to be about watching the lines, dots or arrows as they scroll across the screen and triggering a button just as they reach a marker, but rather you should be using them as a guide for what to hit and use the rhythm of the song to dictate the timing. This is beatmania's biggest shortcoming.    While the track list is the main problem, it isn't beatmania's only, however. The game's scoring system, or rather its Groove Gauge, the meter of your overall performance outside of the score, feels unbalanced and awkwardly calculated. It's based on the ~here and now~ immediacy of your performance rather than either your overall scoring or even a reasonably large subsection therein. The result is that missing a few notes in a row at the end the song can cause you to wind up failing the track, while at the same time you can literally skip the first thirty notes, nail the last section of the song and wind up passing the track. As well, your letter grade for your performance has almost nothing to do with whether you'll pass or not since it's heavily based on how well you do towards the end. I've actually managed to fail a song with a ~B~ grade, while I was able to pass with what I thought was a poorly performed ~C~ simply because I did well at the end.   While it hasn't bothered me, the interface, background effects and videos that play while you jam have annoyed some folks here at the office. The flashy colors, glaring lights and such are rather overdone, and I can easily see how it'll bother some players. It doesn't help that the menus and in-game GUI seems cluttered and a tad confusing. For instance, in order to change the options for a track you need to press Start to access them, even though it looks like you should be able to scroll over to that section of the screen. It's easy to navigate through the options once you know what you're doing, but the setup does seem a bit odd.beatmania certainly had the potential to be a great rhythm game, as its controller and even idea are great. However, its terrible track listing really hampers the experience, and its overly flashy UI doesn't help.", "date": "Mar 29, 2006"}
