{"name": "Top Gun: Fire At Will", "name_review": "Top Gun: Fire At Will", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/top-gun-fire-at-will", "text": "Originally released on the PC, Top Gun was a passable flight sim with nothing much to distinguish it from other sims, aside from the movie-licensed name. The PlayStation version has even less to recommend it. In fact, the appearance of FMV Tom Cuise could've helped this poor sucker.  For starters, the flight sim control's been junked. OK, fine, but the replacement configuration isn't even up to basic arcade standards. Your F-14 Tomcat has absolutely no momentum whatsoever. You climb, fall, and turn for exactly as long as you hold down the button, and then stop dead in mid-air when you release it. Disconcerting to say the least.  The game's other major fault is the level of difficulty. It's either way too low, as in most of the basic missions, and then way too hard on the boss levels. Enemy fire which just flew past you in the basic missions becomes dead accurate on the boss level. Go figure. For a real cool arcade-style war shooter, check out Ace/Air Combat (1 or 2), and leave Top Gun behind.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
