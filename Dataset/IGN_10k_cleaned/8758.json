Like many other Golden Age gems, it has found new life on Xbox Live Arcade and comes packaged with 3D graphics, an actual soundtrack, and new sound effects. But is that enough to perpetuate its longevity?  For the most part, yes.   Whether players choose Missile Command's prettier face or its original blocky complexion, its gameplay is classic. Players are charged with the defense of Planet Zargon's six cities by way of firing missiles from three turrets at left, right, and center positions. Turrets rotate as the player's cursor is maneuvered around the screen, cities shatter into fragments when enemy missiles reach them, and certain levels transition from day to night, accompanied by different lighting effects shown against each stage's backdrop, though these are minimal. Instead of pixilated trails accompanying each player-fired missile, twisted shafts of lightning spark through the sky, with the tip of each bolt detonating after a couple of seconds at the player's chosen point of impact. This graphical technique is a bit misleading when compared to the original game's method of showing the missile's trail before it detonated at the player's chosen point. The delay in detonation makes things difficult at first, but it didn't take me too long to get the timing down to a science.   No longer will players have to squint to determine how many missiles are left in each silo or count the cities still standing after each round, as a much cleaner interface is part of the game's new graphics engine. The number of remaining cities is displayed clearly at the top of the screen, and each missile silo displays its remaining ammunition in numeric form, as well as with a small graph.    Easily enhanced over the original game's beeps and screeches are appropriate explosions, though in terms of music, I wholeheartedly recommend turning the game's new soundtrack completely off. Techno music just doesn't seem to fit Missile Command's theme, as the lack of music in the original inspired concentration and technique, not the feeling of being in a dance club. In addition, the music is painfully generic, and will almost certainly annoy players after only a few short rounds.   Though only a minor complaint, I found the Evolved game mode to be quite a bit easier than the original. In the latter, missiles increase in descending speed quite rapidly, and enemy ships seem to deploy a greater number, increasing the frantic time spent detonating each round's bombs. In Evolved mode, the missiles do increase in speed, but quite gradually; I found that I lasted for a much greater number of rounds in the enhanced game over the original. The game is still difficult, but veteran players may prefer the faster pace and greater challenge of the original.   The game's greatest weakness is its repetitive nature. You can only blast the same enemy ships and projectiles so many times before growing very, very bored. It's fun for a while, but doesn't offer much incentive to keep playing, other than higher rankings on Leaderboards.   Missile Command is a title that stands the test of time. Despite the game's eventual tedium, it will only set players back 400 Microsoft Points (US$5), and is still a memorable experience, one that both accomplished and new missile commanders will want to experience.", "date": "Jul 5, 2007"}
