The first few gens of game-playing handsets enjoyed something of a pass because of limited tech and limited expectations. But now that high-end cellphones have crept to the border of PSone territory, it's time to adjust those once quite low expectations.   EA Mobile's NBA Love 07 comes in two editions -- 3D and 2D -- but this review is strictly for the 3D edition. After significant game time with a 2D build, another review will show up on IGN Wireless. This high-end version can only be played on 3D-enabled handsets, such as the LG VX8000 series on Verizon Wireless. I make very specific mention of this because a lot of people only saw the 3D screenshots and news for EA Mobile's Madden NFL 07 and assumed all versions looked like that before I posted the 2D review shortly thereafter. I received some emails from very disappointed consumers and I want to help avoid any confusion with NBA Live 07.   However, the visuals may be different, but there are some universal features in NBA Live 07 -- namely, the use of a full league license. All thirty NBA teams are included in NBA Live 07. Rosters appear to be very up-to-date (I admit that I didn't have time to check all 30 teams, so I stuck with some of the bigger teams). And most of the players have their official stats.   All action is five-on-five; NBA Live 07 is not an arcade-style baller. This is a sim, a category that has not traditionally fared well on the smallest screens. However, the pacing of the game is slowed down to the point where it's manageable. Whether this is technical or on-purpose, I don't know. But trading off breakaway plays for being able to easily move the ball around is worth it. To pass, you simply press the corresponding number key hovering over a player. The slower pace gives you a chance to actually scan all of the available players and make an informed decision.   One thing that didn't necessarily work for me was using the star key to change offensive plays. Supposedly, you can change tactics between things like Big Man and Charge In before going in for the shot (attached to 5 or OK). But this complicated matters a little too much and I wasn't really able to discern how much of a difference this made with the overall play.   Nobody will ever confuse this game with the console edition, but it's important to note that because of the pace change, the game never gets truly exciting. It's not boring, but there are few electric moments. What NBA Live 07 offers is a very competent game of stripped-down mobile basketball full of solid ball movement and shots, but only marginal defense. You still have to cycle through defensive players with a single key and then try to hit the block button in time.   The mobile edition is fitted with a quick play option for an instant game or get into a lengthy season with a nice quick save to get you right back in the thick of a game if real life comes a-callin'.   Now, about those 3D graphics -- they are good, but not spectacular. Sacrifices were made to get all players on the screen and keep things moving at a decent clip. The players are indeed polygonal, but they lack a lot of definition. Legs are composed a two sticks that meet at a joint, for example. However, clothed in authentic uniforms, they don't look bad. The camera does a good job following the action around the court. Replays (which you can skip) get in for decent-looking close-ups.   NBA Live 07 features excellent audio. The Marv Albert commentary is well-implemented, even if the comments do repeat quite often. It's still impressive to hear the clear digital speech layered and layered audio of an in-progress ball game.  The 3D edition of NBA Live 07 is one of the better ballers I've played on mobile, thanks to some good offensive controls and smart pacing that brings the action down to a manageable pace. The defensive controls don't match the easy-to-use offensive mechanics, so the game feels a little lop-sided. The visuals are good and the sound is fantastic. If you have a 3D-enabled handset, love basketball, and fully understand that you're not holding an Xbox in your hands, NBA Live 07 offers solid value.", "date": "Nov 20, 2006"}
