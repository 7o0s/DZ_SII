It was about this time last year when Midway released Wayne Gretzky Hockey '98 on the N64 community. But anyone who ripped the shrinkwrap off the packaging and plugged the cartridge into the system came to the sudden realization that, well, the company repackaged the previous version of the game. There was no way to tip-toe around that fact, and we graded it accordingly.  Well, Acclaim pulled a Midway. The box that says NHL Breakaway 99 (no apostrophe) houses the same cartridge that was in the first hockey game. Well, almost. There are a few subtle differences, but for argument's sake, if you've played last year's version, you sure as hell don't need to play this one. The Facts  All NHL teams (including Nashville Predators) and more than 600 players from the NHLPA  Up-to-date team rosters   Season and playoff stat tracking in more than 45 categories   Create players  Five gameplay modes: exhibition, season, playoffs, practice and shoot-out mode   Four player simultaneous multiplayer mode Rumble Pak support Memory Pak support   Gameplay  When Breakaway came out as the first hockey sim on N64, it played well enough to hold its own against the competition. Since then, EA has stepped up to the plate and has released NHL 99, raising the N64's hockey genre in both gameplay and the graphics department. In Breakaway 99, nothing has changed. The floaty puck physics, the sloppy layout, and the somewhat sluggish controls are back for a second time. Oh, wait, the designers added the changed crease to the ice texture. Well, that's one thing this game has over NHL 99.  The controls just aren't nearly as responsive as what's necessary for a fast-paced game like hockey. It would have been great if some time was spent ironing out the playability, but if you're going to put out a rush product, corners have to be cut. Graphics  For a company that takes pride in its trademarked Hi-Rez mode, Acclaim boggles with last year's medium-resolution game. Last year, it was understandable. This year, however -- this is the only Acclaim sports product that isn't in high resolution. Here's your first indication that this is a rehash, folks.  If you've seen the '98 edition, it's the same deal: pastel 3D players running at decent framerates, skating around an icerink. The ice textures are changed, but there are still no player reflections and the ice doesn't deteriorate over time. In fact, now the game looks extremely dated thanks to the medium-high resolution (640x240) MLB-designed NHL 99. The animation in Acclaim's game -- just like last year's model -- also lacks in the motion-capturing detail of its other N64 games like All-Star Baseball, NFL Quarterback Club, and NBA Jam. Finally, the menu system has been altered slightly, but it's still nowhere up there with EA's or even Acclaim's own sports titles.   Sound  Not surprising, the only change to the sound comes from a new intro soundtrack (which honestly sounded better last year) and the new speech sample for the Nashville Predators. That's all we could find. But -- again, not surprising -- last year's design flaw still exists this time around, where the organ music cranks out while the puck is in play. Nuh-uh, wrong.   Another indication that no effort was made to make Breakaway '99 something more than just a rehash -- where's that Acclaim sound compression for play-by-play commentary? Hey, the other sports titles had it... There's no rationalizing here, people -- Acclaim wanted a '99 product forits hockey property, and it seems the only thing the company did was spenda weekend tweaking last year's version. And even that sounds like anexaggeration. This is the cheap way out, so don't encourage Acclaim bybuying this game. Besides, EA Sports' NHL 99 is a nicer looking and anicer-playing game of hockey, too. Get that one. Let Breakaway 99 rot onshelves and turn up in bargain bins. And even then you shouldn't botherpicking it up.", "date": "Dec 8, 1998"}
