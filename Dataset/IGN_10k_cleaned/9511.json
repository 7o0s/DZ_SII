{"name": "Smarty Pants", "name_review": "Smarty Pants Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/14/smarty-pants-review", "text": "It was just a matter of time before a publisher designed a trivia game for Wii's growing casual audience -- that demographic which doesn't have time for an epic adventure or for online frag-fests. Luckily, the first one, Smarty Pants from Electronic Arts, is good. Not only does it feature some 20,000 questions of varying difficulty, but it utilizes the Wii remote well most of the time, too. Since the interface is easy to navigate and the fundamentals of trivia so inherently intuitive to understand, any casual player can pick this game up and have fun with it -- a truth demonstrated when we played Smarty Pants against several of our non-gamer friends and their wives, all of us fully entertained. Smarty Pants is heavy on trivia and light on gestures, which is just fine by us -- not every game need be overflowing with waggle, we're sure you'll agree. However, when you break it all down, this simple game of modified Jeopardy! is grossly overpriced -- it'd be a bargain at $19.99 or at least adequately placed at $29.99, but EA expects players to pay full price for a one-trick pony, the largest failing of the package.  Smarty Pants may be a one-trick pony, but it is at least a one-trick pony done right. The game not only features slick, simple menus that make easy navigation possible, but it incorporates Mii avatars so that you can play as yourself. If you don't have a Mii, you can choose from a pre-created character supplied by the title. Once you enter your age, the project determines what you should know and sends age-appropriate questions your way, which means that you could play against your son or daughter and Smarty Pants would match tailored queries to both age groups, a highly clever solution to trivia offerings, which have in the past always favored older participants. The title doesn't pull any punches on questions -- there's some incredibly difficult trivia, but there are some no-brainers, too.   We can do this.  8-bit, plus 8-bit, plus 6-bit, plus 6-bit... Nintendo 64?  As with any trivia game, Smarty Pants feels altogether pointless as a single-player affair, but flourishes with two or more people. You can choose from a hefty 20,000 questions spread across several different engaging categories, from sports, art, books and science to places and people, entertainment, fashion and, of course, games (which is not exclusive to, but generally focuses on videogames). Two different gameplay types add unique twists to the trivia. In countdown, you and friends are asked questions and the longer you take to answer, the fewer points you earn. In wager, players participate in a pre-game target practice, the goal to shoot as many plus or minus icons, each capable of increasing or decreasing the point value of queries in the next round, as possible. Both modes are fun, but we prefer wager because the target practice makes use of the Wii remote's IR pointer, injecting a layer of welcomed skill to the experience. If sports is the next category and your buddies are bound to know every answer, you can strategically decrease the point value before the match -- if, that is, you're quick with the Wii remote.   Target practice is but one example of how well the game subtly uses the controllers. Not only do you need to know the answers to questions, but you have to be fast with Nintendo's controller in order to ~buzz~ in first. To do that, you simply snap the peripheral backward, a motion that has a satisfying tactile element to it -- it feels every bit as good as slamming on a buzzer and much better than pressing any button. However, not all the Wii remote additions are welcomed. We've played so many Wii games that we've come to know two fundamental truths. Never use the nunchuk to control a camera if it can be avoided, and always use A+B-trigger to grab onto objects, pick them up and move them when applicable. The latter would seem an ideal fit for spinning the category wheel in Smarty Pants, but instead the game forces you to make a useless cranking motion in order to add power to your spins. The worst offenders, though, are the dance-offs -- unnecessary pre-trivia challenges that make you waggle the controller around -- you're really supposed to be flailing your arms around and dancing like a happy jackass -- to add points to the questions that follow. Every facet of the game was a hit with our non-gamer friends -- except, that is, for the dancing sequences.    Despite a few gimmicky gestures motions, the game is fun, particularly when you play in teams -- two against two. We found that our team members would accidentally belt out the answer even after we had already took a stab at it and guessed wrong; the result is that the opposition could use their knowledge. Accidents like these are always good for a laugh. Meanwhile, if you are the type of player with a twitchy finger, the game may actually penalize you. Supposing you buzz in before a full query has been displayed and guess incorrectly, you will effectively go to jail and be unable to participate in the next round; it's a free point for the competition, in other words.  The developer has clearly put some thought into the trivia mechanics and as a result Smarty Pants is a fun and sometimes-challenging game. You might even learn a thing or two. The bad news is that a good trivia game comes at a price -- actually, a hefty price tag. While well made, a title this simple should be priced to compete, especially if EA hopes to target the casual sector. However, for some baffling reason, the game will set you back $49.99 -- the same price as Super Mario Galaxy, for example. Uh, youch? I really think Smarty Pants is a well made trivia game for Wii. It's got a few issues with forced gimmicky controls, particularly the dance sequences, but for the most part the topics are well chosen, the questions varied, the Wii pointer functionality dead on and the tactile feel of buzzing in by snapping backward with the peripheral very rewarding. It also happens to be a really enjoyable multiplayer endeavor that your non-gamer friends can understand and get behind. However, there's no getting behind the fact that Smarty Pants is a one-trick pony whose very simple design doesn't warrant the price tag EA has given it. I  can't ignore that, and our final score reflects it. If, on the other hand, money is no object for you and if you're not planning to play alone, feel free to add a full point to my score. At the very least, give the game a look when it inevitably does see a price reduction.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
