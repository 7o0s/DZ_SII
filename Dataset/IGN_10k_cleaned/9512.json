In Power Golf, it's the controls.  This game is, on the surface, a perfectly inoffensive and easily forgettable non-licensed golf sim from the early '90s. One of those staple releases  the golf game on the TurboGrafx. But anyone who's ever played it or will ever play it won't be forgetting it quite so easily, because underneath that inoffensive surface is an incredibly frustrating implementation of swinging club control.   The meter moves too quickly. You know the meter  if you've played most any older golf game from the last few decades you're familiar with it. You press a button to start your swing, at which time a little arrow starts moving to the left on a power meter at the bottom of the screen. You press the button again near the left end of the meter to set your shot's power, and then press it a third time as the arrow heads back to the right to set your shot's accuracy. One, two, three button presses in a row. Simple. Uncomplicated.   Unless that little arrow moves faster than a bolt of lightning, which makes things not so simple, and which is precisely the case in Power Golf. Here, the standard controls golf sim players are used to from Mario Golf, Hot Shots and more are almost unplayably speedy. Your shots will soar wildly off course to the left or right if you're not absolutely perfect on the trigger, and it's nearly impossible to do  so most of the time you'll be hacking your ways through bunkers and rough, or else watching your ball sail out of bounds or into water hazards at no real fault of your own.   Power Golf's visuals aren't that bad. Its controls, though, are another story.  And that's not too much fun at all. With practice and patience, you can begin to adjust enough to the rapid pace of the meter and at least make it through a few holes or so. But then, the longer you stick with Power Golf, the more elements you'll find to be lacking.   Because club selection isn't automatic, as it is in most other golf titles. And each different club makes the meter move even more erratically. And there's no visual guide on the screen to help you judge how far your ball will fly if struck at maximum power. And there's no good way to line up your shots, either from the tee or on the green. (If you make it to the green.)   That's a lot of negatives to have to ignore, and a lot of good reasons for you to ignore this old Turbo title. Though it does support multiple players, and it does have a few different types of gameplay, and its visuals are actually pretty watchable, thanks to the Turbo's classic, colorful graphical style, it's just not home to anything redeeming enough to justify suffering through its terribly implemented meter mechanic.So steer clear of Power Golf on the Virtual Console, as it's nowhere near worth its 600 Wii Point asking price. A much better option would be NES Open Tournament Golf, which is 100 Points cheaper and much more accessible an experience. Or else you could look forward to the next physical media release to adapt the sport  Super Swing Golf: Season 2 is set to debut in just a few more weeks. We may eventually get some better, more classic, more notable past golf titles on the Virtual Console  this one comes to mind  but we're not quite there yet. So, for now, you may want to just keeping on waiting in the clubhouse.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
