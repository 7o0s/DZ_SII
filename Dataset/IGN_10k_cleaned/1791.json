{"name": "Iron Aces", "name_review": "Iron Aces", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/15/iron-aces", "text": "When I was a wee, young sapling of a geek, one of my biggest interests was studying and reading about warplanes.  I used to geek out at the library in front of large books titled ~The Planes of World War II~, ~The History of Aviation~, and even read Chuck Yeager's autobiography.  Something about the cool designs of those fighters, the dog-fighting scenarios, and awesome weaponry made some great reading for a lad of 14.  However, when it came to playing flight simulation games, my interest in flying virtual planes took a nosedive; I'm just not one to stay at a constant altitude of 10,000 feet and cruise the sky for an hour.  Additionally, because it's a simulation, controlling the plane meant keeping track of altitude, wind currents, how much flap to use... it just wasn't fun for me.  Though Iron Aces has strong flight-sim roots, it takes out some of the complex elements of flying to make this World War II flight sim a little less painful and a lot more enjoyable.  While I say this game is set in during World War II, the actual setting of Iron Aces changes a few names just for fun.  For example, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan are renamed to the countries Valiant, Trincer, Blocken, and Yamato (respectively). The geography has also been changed a bit to fit the story, though the remainder of the plot falls more or less with the history of World War II.  The Blocken empire, together with the Japanese soldiers from Yamato, are out for world domination and create the Axis powers.  To counter this evil threat, the Americans from Valiant and the Brits from Trincer unite to from the Allied coalition.  You play as one of the pilots from the Allied coalition as you go from one area to another piloting over a dozen authentic WWII aircraft.  The game also adds a little ~fiction~ in the aircraft selection, including the Japanese rear-propeller driven Shinden that barely saw any action in WWII, as well as the German jet fighter, the Messerschmitt Me262.  The missions are pretty varied and a few missions represent the actual ~historical scenarios~ (i.e. Pearl Harbor and such).  You can jump straight into the action, though it's wiser to be briefed on what needs to be done during each mission.  When you're ready to go, you'll be able to select from various fighters and as you progress deeper into the game, you'll gain access to more planes.  From there, you take the to the skies in your fighter as you go through several different missions whether it's just plain dog-fighting, reconnaissance, or precision bomb raids.  The physics in the game are pretty darn good, while at the same time, not overbearing like a real flight simulator; you don't have to worry about wind effects, stalling, or ~I'M CAUGHT IN A JET WASH~ type situations, allowing you to concentrate on the real action at hand.  Even then, there are some realistic elements that make the game very challenging, almost to the point of frustration.  For example, bomb raids might sound easy  drop a few payloads of explosive death on a ship and make helter-skelter, right?  Nopers... first off, when dropping bombs, they don't just fall straight down as the game accounts how fast your plane is travelling as well as you high you are when you drop a bomb.  You actually have to compensate for both factors, and it took me at least 4-5 runs before I actually nicked a target with my bomb.  Visually, the game isn't taxing the power of the Dreamcast, but it still looks decent.  There are some good lighting effects and the frame rate, though not blazing by any means, is rock solid.  The polygon models of the planes and backgrounds are okay, though you can tell the game has a pretty low polygon count.  And that leads me to believe that this game should've either (A) looked a hella lot better since the frame rate isn't high or (B) the frame rate should be way higher, because of the low polygon count.  Explosions are your standard ~3D~ fare that we've seen in plenty 3D games, so overall, you're not going to be wowed visually at all.  Though the visuals aren't very impressive, for a flight-sim type game, Iron Aces isn't that bad, and flight-sim fans will probably enjoy the varied missions, numerous selectable aircraft, and solid play mechanics.  There's even a two-player versus mode that doesn't seem to have any noticeable visual setbacks.  For those looking for some WWII dog-fighting action, Iron Aces will definitely suffice.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 15, 2001"}
