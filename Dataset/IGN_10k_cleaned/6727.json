That game was stunningly generic and overwhelmingly underwhelming in originality, a bland platformer that couldn't even go by the numbers in its design. Luckily for the film's sequel, the Nintendo DS design steps away from being badly ordinary. Unluckily, the more original design is insanely flawed and frustratingly repetitive, forcing players to constantly replay levels over and over in order to complete them and move on. The addition of DS-tailored mini-games is a little  clich, but it does make the game better than average. Just not much better.As of this writing the film still has about two weeks to go before it officially hits theaters, sliding onto the screen three years since the original film. We'll leave commentary and criticisms on the actual movie out of this since, well, we haven't seen it. But at least the game promises to follow the film's plot with the three main characters Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the sabretooth out to rescue animals trapped by the great meltdown of the ice age's end.The Nintendo DS version is a completely original SKU, meaning though its situations may be similar to the console and handheld games, the design is completely separate from the Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance versions released at the same time. This is good news, especially to those who may remember last year's saturation of GBA-Plus development where teams would double up handheld development with one title spanning across both Nintendo portables. Not so with Ice Age 2 - this game is ground-up design on the dual screen platform.  But just because it's exclusively developed on the Nintendo DS doesn't mean anything for its quality control. So, while yes there's solid 3D engine, dual screen gameplay, touch screen minigames at work, the issue with Ice Age 2 boils down to poor design planning.The problem is, the primary level design is structured so poorly that it actually requires players to romp through them multiple times. Each level is a collect-a-thon through huge levels that challenges players to find the ONE collectible that will allow them to open up the next level. If you don't find that item before time's up, the level ends, the game records the high score and throws you back into the level to do it again. Everything's on a clock with time that's replenished by scooping up snowflakes, so there's plenty of opportunity to keep the clock alive. But even with these opportunities, it's very rare that you'll be able to finish a level on the first try, and depending on player trial and error is more for a puzzle game, not an action game.The designers point the way to the level's one collectible by lining the way with golden acorns. The problem with this is, players have to switch between the three different characters in order to follow the path. This isn't Lost Vikings where switching characters is on the fly - players can only change their on-screen guy by touching an icon representing the mammoth, sloth or sabretooth. If you're not the sloth, you cannot climb. If you're not the mammoth you cannot bash down barricades. And if you're not the sabretooth, you cannot leap along strategically placed platforms. Good idea, but bad overall planning because the constant tracking and backtracking means that you'll easily lose the path you were following, since the golden acorns are collectibles in themselves - scoop them up and your path to the prize is gone. Once you learn how to deal with the flaws in the main game the later levels get a little better, but it's still tiring to realize that the first time in a level won't be the only time in the level.The 3D used for the game is pretty okay, though it seems a little unstable. Glitches pop up briefly but frequently, flashing the screen with quick flicks of graphic garbage for no reason. The bigger problem is the game's fixed overhead camera - it's permanently angled in a top-down fashion and never zooms in or scales back for a bigger picture, nor does it tip far enough at an angle to see ahead of the player any good distance.The addition of mini-games interspersed between the main game levels do make things a little better, and certainly raise the game's overall score out of the ~bad~ scale. There's nothing tremendously great or original going on in these minichallenges and touch-screen boss battles, but they, at the very least, kick things back for the player after the aggravation of being forced to play the previous level multiple times to get it right.It's not hard to assume that Ice Age 2 is intended for a younger, kid gamer, but honestly the designers don't do all that great a job tailoring the design for that age group. Frustration begins right from the first level after the training mission - goals are never clear cut and puzzles getting there are never obvious. The game's main challenge is a flawed mess, but at least the production's improved with some halfway decent DS touchscreen challenges and bosses. But getting to them requires a little too much annoying repetition.", "date": "Mar 15, 2006"}
