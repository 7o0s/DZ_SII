A series with magnificent graphics, an excellent engine, and plenty of large interactive environments, it was one of those rare types of games that few have seen before or since.   Seeing a hole that's been open for far too long, the team at Titus and Sapphire have finally answered the cries of genre fans, and put together a new title all of their own. And while it's a completely different effort all the way around, it does manage to successfully capture the spirit of the Power Stone series - that effort is Barbarian.   Story  The once tranquil land of Barbaria has been cursed. Clouded under a dark shroud of death and disease, the world is slowly being eaten alive. The man responsible, a powerful wizard named Zaugg, has convinced the people throughout the land that there is no hope for their existence, and that his rule is the one and only.   But there is a prophecy. The foretelling of a great Barbarian warrior who will rise up against the wizard Zaugg and bring balance to the land. Alas what identity will the legendary warrior take? Could it be the revenge-minded Dagan of Dolok? Or maybe Magnus, Lord of the Undead; perhaps even Zaugg's own apprentice Corath will be the end of the spiteful necromancer. The answer is not clear, but that is where you come in. Assuming the role of 10 unique combatants, it is your duty to defeat the monstrous soul and finally give a happy ending to this sad, twisted story.   Gameplay  Barbarian tries hard, it really does. Borrowing plenty of elements from the aforementioned Power Stone series, the control scheme is pretty straightforward. With two levels of attack (weak and strong), a jump key and grapple, and a couple of magical techniques, there's plenty of fighting methods to choose from.   Once you've mastered the buttons, you're sure to find plenty of combos and attacks; no two battles should ever be the same experience as you can pummel, smash, and juggle your opponents until your heart's content. Going head to head with one of your fellow barbaric freaks actually turns out to be a lot of fun, especially when you realize the types of things you can do once it has started.    Pick up surrounding rocks, uproot trees from their base, or lift a couple of nearby boxes and toss them at your foe, and you've only just begun. Move on to nearby poles and pillars and climb to the top to avoid projectile attacks, or just simply break through a barrier and continue onto another section of the stage DOA-style. With some levels spanning up to four sections wide, the fighting environments are not only interactive but gigantic as well. Putting it all together, you have a very strategic platform for battle, and you'd better be prepared to use your brains in addition to your brawn.   But there's more. As not only can you fight against one of the 10 main characters but also four lesser nobodies, who will throw themselves into the action against anything that moves. Completely adjustable before a battle, you can choose your own poison as they say, and decide whether or not you're up for a one-on-one, or an all-out melee.   You can even play through a quest mode and earn experience RPG-style to upgrade your characters abilities to lift things, recover health, defend yourself, and hit harder. A great way to discover the histories and futures of all the main protagonists, Quest is a gleefully challenging one-player option. It even carries over into the Versus mode, wherein you can import your new super stud and send him against the unsuspecting lot of buddies you've herded into the living room.   It's great fun yes, but not without a couple of problems that could put the hardcore fighting fan out on the fence. Since the game takes place in full 3D, the need to press a button for block instead of the familiar ~back~ motion can create an inconvenience that some may not be prepared for. The fact that block doesn't necessarily stop damage very effectively, probably won't help either.   The movement too, is rather sluggish. Making for some delayed reactions when imputing your commands and can often result in taking unwarranted hits. And lastly, magic projectiles don't hit their targets very often. Even when you have someone dead in your sights, it will end up zooming past them; revealing a slightly off-perspective point of view.    Despite those caveats, Barbarian still manages to turn out to be a fun little party game. Especially when rumbling with four players. Sprawling and hectic, there's a lot more to like than not.   Graphics  One of the biggest improvements I've seen a game make from beta to final form in terms of graphics for quite some time, Barbarian is slick. In line for both Xbox and GameCube versions later this year, I'd be hard pressed to see what kind of improvements could be made. As both the character models and textures are detailed and realistic.   Rippling muscles, shaggy fur, stone terraces, and breathtaking skylines are all part of what makes Barbarian tick, and the artists took advantage of that. Dousing each character in multiple rays of light when casting spells and throwing in subtle little details like frosty breath in the colder stages was just the beginning. The true graphical standout is the stages themselves.   Described best as a combination of Power Stone and Dead or Alive, each fighter-specific area is crawling with personality.  Swamps, ponds, boulders, and wondrously midori-draped trees are everywhere, with plenty of light sourcing and particle effects to highlight them. Using the multi-tiered theme to their advantages, the artists have also taken the liberty to get pretty fantastic with some of their ideas. Including fighting alongside an anchored pirate ship and deep inside the cavern of a giant spider. Don't be surprised if you spend a lot of time in training or versus modes just running around to admire the view, we did.   If there were one section that Saffire could have improved upon though, it would have to be the framerate. Not a distraction by any means, the mostly-fluid action stutters every now and then with too many characters on screen at once. Not generally an issue when the camera is zoomed out for the far battles, but when coming in close, it's definitely noticeable. We also would have appreciated more camera angles and perhaps some additional animations, but in retrospect could have caused additional frame issues. So perhaps we're better left without it.   Sound  Conan the Barbarian only wishes that he had minstrels like these. Made up primarily of heavy drum pounding, orchestral horns, and accompanying loud moans, Sapphires soundtrack is terrific. Successfully emulating the same power scores that movies like Beastmaster and Kull the Conqueror have been flaunting for ages, Barbarian's composition is as stirring as you can ask for. A normally cheesy undertaking by those who have lesser ambitions, we found ourselves seriously impressed.   The voices also are pretty top notch, with an appropriately foreboding narrator who translates the tale for each character as they journey through Barbaria in their quest to stop Zaugg. Even the fighters themselves are pretty convincing, although they are made up primarily of grunts, growls, and ways to express pain.   Admittedly though, the sound effects could have used a little extra clang in their cornflakes. Weapon-based combat that it is, a more prominent sense of metal when banging heads with another warrior is definitely warranted. But this is just a minor point, and the sounds that we do get in that department work splendidly.In the end, Barbarian can easily lay claim to the fact that it's probably the best console publication that Titus has ever released. A sometimes-enthralling mix of swords and sorcery and old-fashioned beat-em-ups, the Saffire-developed fighter definitely deserves a closer look. But if you like your combat engines tighter and aren't drawn into those pretty (and they are pretty) visuals, then Barbarian may not be your cup of tea.However, for those of you who are willing to take chances on a game you've probably never heard, or aren't particularly picky when it comes to fighting game mechanics you should invite a couple of friends over, break out the yummies, and give it a try. I'm willing to bet that you'd be in for pleasant little surprise.", "date": "Jun 28, 2002"}
