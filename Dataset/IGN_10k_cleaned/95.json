What are you playing homie? I'm doin it up on some COD4 multiplayer right now.~ ~Me, oh, just playing this mobile game called Matchmaker: Love U.~ ~Matchmaker: Love U.? What's that? It sounds hot.~ ~Bro, it's totally hot. You play as a goddess of love sent to Earth to hook up people on a college campus.~ ~You're kidding me? That sounds awesome! Tell me all about it!~   ~Well, you're sent to Earth by your Mom Athena or Aphrodite or one of those goddess chicks, and your goal is to get people to hook up! It's a top down view game and you control the goddess daughter using the worst controls ever put on a cell phone game. Controlling this chick is like trying to swim thru molasses with both arms tied behind your back while having dyslexia.~    ~Dude, sounds awful...~   ~Nah, despite the shoddy controls its pretty dope actually. I got tired of playing all these killer racing and shooter games. Getting little animated characters to hook up is the new way to go when it comes to gaming! You basically walk up to students and start conversations with them and earn their trust. Once they trust you enough, you guys can hang out and you can take them to the gym to work out, the library to study, the club to dance or shoot pool, or the spa to get a makeover.~   ~A makeover? Man, let me pause this ridiculous Call of Duty 4 game. Tell me more! How do you get them to hook up, yo?~   ~Well, first you have to increase their attractiveness to the opposite sex. And being guys, we know how hard that can be, right G? Anyways, you get them to do activities. Like if you're in the library, you can have them throw paper airplanes, or study or use the copy machine! If you're in the gym, get your skinny college friend to workout on the weights or do some cardio! If they're self conscious about their looks, have them spend some time in the spa. Each activity can be done daily if you put it on the students' schedule and it increases their stats. Your Mom will sometimes visit you on Earth and give you goals to accomplish. But you only have a certain number of days to complete goals. Anything from increasing a student's brain stats, to getting over a two star heart match when you set up a date.~   ~Dude, you gotta tell me more about the dates. Where do they go? How much action do you see? Gotta be at least third base, right?~   ~Slow down, Seabiscuit. This ain't that kind of cell phone party! This game is for teenage girls or more grown adult men like us. This isn't your average dumb horny teenage game, bro. You talk to a student and tell them you're setting them up on a date. But make sure you tell the other person about the date, or one of them will get stood up. And we all know what that's like right, fellas? Fellas? Right?? Check this, at the end of the day your matchmaking skills are put to the test and you see the results of their date. Each student will rate their date based on looks, brains, body and conversation. After their rating, you play a mini game to get a chance to increase the heart meter for the date. Sometimes you'll hit a home run when you hook people up, but other times the people still need work if you want them to connect. Maybe they're just not right for each other, you know? But yoyoyo, there's plenty of fish in the sea and you can hook up different people to try and get a match! Hook up two people on at least a four and a half star date, and you gots yourself a couple. Hook it up playa!~   ~Wait a second, sucka. How are you supposed to keep track of all these cats?~   ~You got a built in PDA! Ya man, it's so funky fresh. One page holds your stats and current ranking. One has all of your students and their stats, what they thought of their dates, and other important statistics like their schedule, who they're dating and if they have any special headgear on. Since you're from the Gods and all, your boyfriend Prometheus opened up a special shop wear you can purchase clothing to put on your students. The special clothing makes their date think that the person's stats are better than they really are! It's like when a girl puts on tons of makeup and you think she's super hot in the dark lighting of the club, but when you get outside into some proper lighting, she looks like Two-Face, yo! It's pretty killer tricking fools like that, but you gotta get your goals accomplished, son!~   ~Man, that sounds dope. I'm sick of trying to hook up with random chicks in real life. This game sounds like it would be more fun. How are the graphics, G? Are the chicks bangin'?~   ~Dude, the graphics are cool. The little dudes and dudettes are all animated really funny like. Like when you tell them to try a mud bath, they take off their clothes and jump right in wearing their boxers or bikini. It's like Girls Gone Cell Phone Wild and stuff. And the conversations are pretty original and dope as well. Each student has their own personality and you have to do your best to get them set on the path of love!~   ~Man, you sold me G. I'm gonna go uninstall these stupid PC games right now and get hooked up!~Smart choice, my friend. Like I said earlier, the controls suck, but the goals and graphics are pretty cool. It gets to be a real challenge trying to hook these fools up, but love aint easy you know? I tell you what, Im learning all kinds of tips about the dating world from this game. Who knew college chicks like to throw paper airplanes? Look out ladies, once I finish this sucker, my new skills and dating techniques are coming after you!", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
