Now add in extremely profane language and over-the-top, crude jokes, and then top everything off nicely with a selection of in-game nudity and uncensored FMV stripper sequences featuring some of the dancers from popular nightclub Scores. It's a recipe for success. Or disaster. In the end, publisher Acclaim Entertainment took its chances and gambled on the concept, and now we have the end result, BMX XXX.  It's an interesting product debut, that's for sure. For all of the flack it's received, you'd think BMX XXX was Hitler reincarnated. Dropped by certain retailers -- the same ones who continue to carry games with overblown violence, we might add -- and hammered by some critics as a cash-in on the ever-expanding adult-targeted genre of games, the title has had it hard. Maybe it's deserved it. But we don't think so.  The truth, as best we can tell, is that BMX XXX is not a grand departure from the me-too copies and countless sequels of extreme sports games, but the same thing repackaged with a crude make over. That in of itself wouldn't be a bad thing -- we enjoyed Dave Mirra 2. But in its update the title seems to have taken a few steps backward so far as play and design are concerned, and this is a problem that no amount of bare breasts and urination jokes can mask.  The Facts  BMX Freestyle Riding Mature content includes profanity, nudity and crude humor In-game scripted events reveal secrets and trigger new events Eight massive levels New flatland riding techniques Create-a-Rider mode Wide variety of split-screen multiplayer modes Running on third-generation Dave Mirra engine Runs in progressive scan mode   Gameplay Before BMX XXX, there was Dave Mirra 2 by the same talented developer -- a company called Z-Axis. Mirra 2 was a well received, but slightly flawed BMX showing: it boasted clean control, huge environments, and an excellent 3D engine, and it was hampered by a clunky camera, some awkward functions, and confusing level and game design. Very few mechanical changes have been introduced to XXX and there are a couple of alterations that seem to be for the worse. So if you didn't like the way Mirra 2 played, you won't like this either. Review done. If, on the other hand, you were a fan of the old freestyle entry, keep reading.  BMX XXX is a fast-moving bike freestyle game full of the potential for big air, big grinds, and big combos. You create or select a rider and then trick through eight big levels in order to complete a series of challenges. There is no world timer -- only timed challenges, so you're free to explore and have fun at your leisure.   As in Mirra 2, the pacing is fluid, the worlds huge and overflowing with jumps, wires, ramps, gaps, and more, all perfect for the stunting. Performing a one-footer off a rooftop feels just as solid and intuitive as it did in Z-Axis' previous biking effort, and that's definitely a good thing. Meanwhile, the developer has this time included the ability to execute a variety of flatland tricks, which can be linked for massive combos and points. The flatland system is, in our experience, not as well executed as that in Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 -- animation is stiff and robotic, not as convincing, and the link system is more difficult -- but it gets the job done. On top of everything else, the grinding system has been altered slightly so that the process of balancing is more intertwined, and that we like. What we don't like, though, is that grinds seem to have simultaneously been sped up, perhaps to offer a great sense of motion, and they don't feel nearly as satisfying as they did in Mirra 2, a disappointment.  XXX features a whopping selection of scripted challenges per world and the only way to advance to the next area is to complete a percentage of them. This is where the best and the worst of the game show their faces -- seem, in fact, to bang heads. On a bright note, the challenges are often well presented and seem to have a place within the universe of the project. They're also mildly humorous at points, though admittedly lowbrow in nature. As an example, in the first area you'll be challenged to find a pimp's group of hookers and return them to him. It's an interesting break from the same old obstacles in extreme sports games of this type, and that's refreshing, but there are flaws in execution. For one, you'll never know where to go because the game gives you very little in the way of assistance in this regard. A countdown timer signals that an individual objective has begun and then it's up to you to race through too-large levels in search of where you need to go or what you need to do. No arrows pointing you in the right direction. No map. It's all guesswork, and it can at times be a frustrating, tedious process. You will fail objectives several times not because you don't know what to do or how to do it, but because you won't be able to find out where to go next. The inevitable comparison has to be made to Tony Hawk 4, which clearly shows you what exactly needs to be done to achieve each goal -- and what a difference it makes.  Then there is the camera system, still jumpy and jerky, still an annoyance and at times a barrier during gameplay scenarios. It seems to bounce against walls and this serves to disorient the action. It gets caught behind areas occasionally too. There has been no improvement to this area since Dave Mirra 2, and that's too bad.  Yes, she's riding topless  If you're in it purely for the thrill of the f-word and the chance to see jiggling breasts, though, you aren't likely to be disappointed with what BMX XXX brings to the table. The game goes out of its way to be vulgar and lewd. There's no subtlety involved. Rather, the title overflows with cussing and gross innuendos, half-naked women and, later, full naked ones too. You'll begin with a limited selection of Scores-girl-endowed FMV sequences and as you advanced you'll be able to unlock more and more, and watch the girls take off more and more too. It's crazy crude, yes, but the jokes -- seeming to appeal to the trashier side in all of us -- will catch you off guard once or twice for a laugh, and scandalous or not there's a certain hook and reel to the idea of unlocking FMV scenes of beautiful women.      So we asked, is it gimmick or a winning combination? Maybe somewhere in the middle. Whether you like the concept or not, it's at least a different one, and we can appreciate that. The problem is that it could have been realized with a greater finesse, without the same flaws and shortcomings that dinked and dented Dave Mirra 2, and it hasn't.  Graphics The visual side of BMX XXX has its ups and downs. The worlds are enormous and filled with all sorts of interactive geometry, from moving cars and trains to a massive variety of ramps, half-pipes, quarter-pipes, stairways, walkways, bridges, tunnels, and more. There's no doubt that Z-Axis is throwing a lot of polygons around at points. The worlds themselves are varied in design, too, from industrial locales to beautiful greens and more, and the sheer scope of each is very impressive.  For every huge world, however, character models are generally unrefined and feature some suspect animation, and most of the textures in the game come off as downright blurry, which is a huge disappointment and probably the ugliest shortcoming in place. It's hard to get behind a so-called beautiful, busty bike rider whose body looks blockier than it does voluptuous. There are similarly collision issues where riders will temporarily fall through the ground or into a wall, which breaks from any sense of realism.  For some reason, both Dave Mirra 2 and especially Aggressive Inline just look prettier than BMX XXX. We're not sure why, considering that the same developer is responsible for all three, but it's the truth.  With all of that noted, the game does feature some notably comical AI characters and scenarios, from bums to pimps, prostitutes, mentally challenged kids and just about everything in between, and the presentation is so grossly exaggerated that a certain likeable style develops.   Two things that we do like: the game runs at a constant 60 frames per second, amazingly smooth and fluid at all times. Plus, it supports progressive scan mode for those with capable televisions. Hurray.  Sound It's weird for those of us who have grown up playing videogames to suddenly hear characters in a game world spouting profanity -- hard profanity -- at every interaction. You almost feel guilty about it. For a second. Then it's amusing for a good while. And then maybe it wears thin.  There is a lot of audio in BMX XXX and most of its very well done. You'll hear everything from nonsensical crazy talk to a wide variety of colorful adjectives in all of their crisp, clear glory. They're funny at points. They're less so at others. The truly adult market -- anybody with half of a head on their shoulders -- is likely to be less impressed with the B-movie comedy writing than those who still consider a swift kick to the groin the height of hilarity, but with that we've had a few hearty laughs at some of the scripted voice work too. It all gets to be a bit repetitive as well, especially when going through the same challenge multiple times, but that's something that's nearly unavoidable.  The music tracks, a mix of hip-hop and thrash, with your standard punk and rock selections filling in the middle, is equally well executed, though some of these songs seem to appear on every extreme sports soundtrack in the universe. At the end of the day, we don't think anybody's going to fall on the floor and praise the listening experience to be had, but it's not a bad one either.  It's easy to get a monkey on your back I'm a big fan of both developer Z-Axis and its last BMX entry, Dave Mirra Freestyle 2, so naturally I was immediately intrigued by the concept of BMX XXX. An enhanced version of Mirra 2 with a well done raunchy makeover could have been not only a lot of fun, but funny, and a refreshing change from the extreme sports copies and sequels that are currently saturating a market near you.'The end result though, as far as I can tell, is a game that's not bad, but somehow not up to par with Mirra 2, or especially Aggressive Inline, and that's a huge disappointment. The basic control and play mechanics are still present, meaning that you'll still be able to have fun catching big air and pulling big tricks for some very special combos. But the title bears all of Mirra 2's flaws and a couple of more to boot, including a sped up grind system that baffles me more than anything else. Meanwhile, the addition of flatland riding seems more of a tack-on than a true innovation. And finally the challenge system -- the worst offender -- is horribly disorienting, and with no means of pointing you in the right direction it's extremely frustrating. I had fun with some of XXX's over-the-top crudeness. Some of the triggered events are well done and humorous. And indeed if it's just cuss words and nudity you're looking for, you've come to the right place as this game's got both in abundance. But these scripted events survive between flawed challenges and an irritating camera system, and having played through the far better interactive worlds of Aggressive Inline and the more polished structure of Tony Hawk 4, there's no going back. Even if it means passing up on the chance to see some Scores girls take it all off.", "date": "Dec 2, 2002"}
