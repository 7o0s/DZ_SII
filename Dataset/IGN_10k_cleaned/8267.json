No matter what ~Top ----- Games of All Time~ list you check, or which game ratings you dig up, certain games always hang at the top of the list.  So when one of these classics gets a revival for current-generation gamers, it's a true achievement not only for the original creators of the game, but also for the platform that has the honor of giving it new life.  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is one of those games, and Microsoft pulled a rabbit out of its hat when it announced this one.  Company reps know it, fans know it, and we know it. The result: Symphony of the Night has landed on Xbox Live Arcade, and along with Geometry Wars Evolved, it's the best download out there.   If you don't know Castlevania: Symphony of the Night by now, you're about 10 years late to the party.  For a franchise that has been around since the beginning of gaming itself, it didn't always have the best sense of direction.  The original NES classic was met with two sequels on the same system, bringing about one of the hardest 8-bit games of all time with Simon's Quest, and one of the biggest cult classics with Dracula's Curse.  After a brief stint on the Super NES and SEGA Genesis platforms, the series seemed to lose its way a bit, until the original release of Symphony of the Night in March of 1997 on Sony's Playstation.  During a burst of 3D game development Castlevania stuck to its roots, and the result is one of the best platformers of all time.  Since then we've seen countless renditions of the more open-ended ~action/adventure/RPG/platformer~ on the GBA and DS, but never a more solid and pure experience than the original Symphony of the Night.     Oh yes we will, Death.  Yes we will... Considering its depth and design, it's odd to even consider Symphony of the Night a Xbox Live Arcade game.  The game's replay value is through the roof, mixing classic platforming with hundreds of weapons and items, a full RPG level-up system, eight magic spells (that make use of Street Fighter d-pad/button combinations), five familiars to discover and level up (to a max level of 50), multiple endings, and dozens of amazingly-crafted boss battles.  Symphony of the Night is a full game, and at the $10 price it not only puts all other XBLA games in their place, but also negates the need for an overpriced copy of the PSX game.  Digital distribution has given the game new life, and for anyone who doesn't own the game or -- dare we even think it -- even played it, this should be the easiest purchase you've ever made.     That being said, the game isn't perfect when compared to its original PSX performance.  The core game is the same, so you'll still have hours and hours of legendary content, but there are a few lingering oddities that keep it from being a hands-down replacement to the original.  For starters, the game had to cut two of its low-end cinemas to make it more XBLA-friendly. Both of the cinemas of the famous castle are extremely short, very low-poly, and in nearly every way worthless to the actual game itself, but they're still missing, and it did leave us wishing they were there.  In addition the game's audio compression suffers just a bit, with a few -- just a few -- of the sound effects receiving most of the hit.  The game can still be played in its original stereo setting (though you'll have to go to the actual system menu in the game itself, not on the XBLA setting menu), but some of the sound effects have odd layering, a couple strange pops, or just don't sound ~right~ as we played through it again.  One such example can be found when picking up a life/heart/magic increasing item; the two-layered effect has an odd break in it.   Along those same lines, the Xbox hardware isn't really the greatest platform for the game's controls, as its primary control feels best with a d-pad, and the 360 controllers have some pretty shoddy pads.  Just like in Street Fighter, hardcore gamers may end up spending the bulk of their first few minutes cursing the controller more than enjoying the game, but after a little getting used to both the sticks and d-pad work just fine (minus the occasional issue).     In the graphics department, Symphony got very little treatment.  We obviously weren't expecting a full HD conversion for the game, but the included ~enhanced~ mode is a decent little bump that could be made without totally ripping apart decade-old assets.  Some basic pixel-blending, shading, and contrast was added, giving the game a slightly more well-rounded and warm look, but that's about it.  Most players wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two, but hardcore gamers and longtime Symphony fans will be happy to get an enhanced - albeit slight - visual presentation.  The only way to rock the 16:9 display, however, is to stretch the game in the settings menu; one area where the future PSP release of the game will be far superior, as the development team is actually diving back into the code of the game.     And in the end, that's really the long and short of it.  We could spend all day ranting about the amazing gameplay, killer boss battles, and unparalleled musical score (with an odd hint of cheesy, cheesy voice acting), but we'd rather you go download the game for yourself and enjoy it.  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is easily one of the greatest games of all time, this is a pretty solid version minus a few oddities and a piss-poor d-pad (if Konami brought the game, the least Microsoft could do is give us a decent pad for it now), and at the price of $10 it's a steal.  We would have loved a more remixed version of the game, 16:9, or tougher/more overall achievements, as there's just an insane amount of game to explore, but in the end this is an amazing game, an incredible download for Microsoft's system, and must-have for any self-respecting gamer out there.  Pass this up and you might as well trade in your 360.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
