Persia did reasonably well, while Beyond was quickly trampled by lesser, higher-profile games in a grand showing of cosmic injustice. Gameloft, Ubi's seemingly mobile avatar, opted to release only a to-go version of Persia on cellphones -- does the game mirror that neo-classic platformer's genius?   Features:   Swashbuckling action mixed with puzzle features  Special moves like rolls and wall-runs.  Eight levels   Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, based on the original platformer by Jordan Mechner, is an update in every sense of the word. Everything from the visuals to the gameplay has been significantly enhanced -- and unlike many updates, the game manages to retain the full spirit of the original while doing so.   Story is purely incidental -- the titular Prince has turned the kingdom's inhabitants into sand creatures by mistakenly spilling the also titular ~Sands of Time.~ The Prince must team up with Farah to defeat the sand creatures and restore the kingdom to normal. But the Prince himself is not unaffected by the Sands of Time himself. When he comes in contact with certain sands, he learns new tricks and talents that help him progress through the game's trickier later levels.   In the beginning, the game plays remarkably like the earlier Prince of Persia games. The Prince must run around the palace, avoiding trap switches on the ground that raise spikes or drop objects from the ceiling. Using a familiar control scheme (up is jump, etc.) the Prince takes standing leaps from ledges to grab onto higher platforms. When sand creatures are sighted, the Prince must use his sword to cut them down.   What elevates Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is the assortment of new moves he learns as he collects the errant Sands. The Prince is able to perform ~wall-runs~ that allow him to cross wide gaps, roll beneath treacherous obstacles, and affect the course of time itself.   The trick to completing Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is to imagine the entire palace as a puzzle rather than an enemy-filled playground. Nothing is there just for the sake of adding a hazard -- everything is somehow inter-connected: This trap kills that guard will allows you to jump up the next level.   Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is Gameloft's second-most attractive game, falling just short of the subtle intensity of Pandora Tomorrow. The levels themselves are incredibly colorful and detailed, and the Prince sports some of the best animation we've ever seen in a handset game. There are two versions of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time floating around -- one that runs on higher-end gaming phones like the N-Gage and Nokia 3650, and a scaled-back edition for phones like the Nokia 6800.Gameloft is managing to do what Ubi Soft pulled off last fall: cemented itself as one of the best games publishers in the business. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a fantastic and fantastical platformer/puzzler that will make an addict out of anybody that downloads it. Like we said in our Pandora Tomorrow review, if you're buying a new cellphone, make sure it plays this game.", "date": "Apr 17, 2004"}
