It's all in the nose, really. Rather beakish. But whether or not her face lives up to her name, her popularity can't be denied. Raven's Disney Channel sitcom, That's So Raven, has already been the basis for two Game Boy Advance adventures. Now it's arrived on the DS, and though your first instinct might be to dismiss it for its license, That's So Raven: Psychic on the Scene is a licensed game done well. Follow your nose to enlightenment by reading on below.    Raven is a psychic. That's the premise of the show. The trouble is, she's not very good at it. Premonitory visions will overcome her throughout each day, giving her fuzzy, unfocused glimpses into the future. These portents usually point to trouble, and that's the case again in Psychic on the Scene. Here, the story opens with Raven's vision that her favorite theater is going to be closed and run into the ground to make room for a strip mall.    The plot is like something straight out of the show, which is good. In fact, Psychic on the Scene feels, overall, a lot like an episode of That's So Raven. The tone and structure, presentation and look are all a perfect fit for the license. It's a good foundation to build an adventure on.    The adventure takes the form of a point-and-click, similar to classic LucasArts PC titles like The Secret of Monkey Island or Buena Vista's own Hannah Montana, released earlier this year on the DS. Raven explores a variety of environments, gathering items and talking to other characters - some from the show, some generic. It's all about solving mysteries, clarifying Raven's clouded clairvoyance by snooping around and gathering information in places where you shouldn't be allowed to go.    Disguises come into play at that point. Raven may be denied access to, for example, kitchen areas at a restaurant, but not if she dresses up like a chef. Psychic on the Scene is one of few games I've played where changes in your character's appearance affect the gameplay. And everything's visible, too. If Raven puts on a jacket in the changing room menu, then she'll appear wearing that jacket in game. If you think that's unremarkable, consider the RPG genre. In 90% of games there, your equipment doesn't make any visual difference. Whether I've donned a leather cap or a diamond-crusted helm of wisdom, my on-screen hero's look doesn't change at all.    Raven, though, is fully customizable. You can mix and match tons of outfits for her, change her hairstyle, swap her shoes. Then you can alter the color of any element. Then, on top of that, you can create your own patterns to appear on her clothing. Like Animal Crossing, in a way.       A fashion mode is nothing new, as several other recent DS licensed games aimed at a young female audience have included something similar. But in That's So Raven the feature is much more satisfying, simply because your designs actually appear on Raven as she runs around completing the main adventure. She's displayed too small on the screen to appreciate the fine detail in your pattern work, but you know it's there.    Psychic on the Scene is rounded out, as has become DS custom, with a small set of touch screen mini-games. Each of these is presented well, and some are rather robust. The culinary contest, Crazy Cook, is deep enough that fans of Cooking Mama may want to give it a glance. And Super Seamtress is, I believe, the first sewing machine simulator on the DS.    If this Raven quest has a negative, it's pacing. Playing it feels a little slow, probably stemming from the leisurely strut Raven takes in striding around each environment. The goals and progression are simple, too. Complexity and challenge don't ever enter in to the equation. That just means an overall casual experience of play, though, so it's not a big drawback. That's So Raven: Psychic on the Scene is the kind of game that you'd love to be able to insult and ridicule. Lots of licensed games get that treatment. Lots of licensed games deserve that treatment. But not this one. Raven's first trip to the DS is a treat for fans of her series, so if you or someone on your shopping list is counted among that audience, pick it up.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
