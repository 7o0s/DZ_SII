Metro 3D's Dual Blades feels like those days during the genre's early years where dozens of new series were oozing out into the arcade, SNES and Genesis systems, trying to capitalize on the success Capcom and Midway had during that gaming era. Dual Blades suffers the same problems the ~other~ fighters had back then: bland character design, basic gameplay options, and just an overall generic feeling to its presentation. That's not to say the game is bad, but it just doesn't pack enough wallop to get noticed in the glut of GBA titles releasing this year. Features Eight characters Training mode Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  It's probably intimidating for game developers to try and produce a brand-new fighting videogame, what with the quality that companies like Capcom, Namco, and SNK have been able to produce in their own series of fighters. But Vivid Image, the same development team that attempted to out-do Super Mario Kart with its own Street Racer, tries its hand at the fighting genre dominated by those Japanese game designers.  In Dual Blades, players choose one of eight different fighters (plus an extra one that's unlocked after completing the game) to do damage to the opposing fighter the computer or another player via link cable controls. These fighters are rather uninspired in their character designs, lacking any real memorable flair. You've got Efe, a robed swordsman; Kanae a Japanese swordswoman; Brandon, a shirtless swordsman...okay, you get the picture. Each of these characters have their own crazy attacks and text after winning a bout, but it's obvious that these fighting guys and gals won't ever get their own fanclub, spinoff, or even a future sequel.  The actual fighting engine is definitely inspired by both Capcom's Street Fighter II and SNK's Samurai Shodown, with focus both on upclose air-juggling combos as well as special moves that players can pull off from a safe distance. Dual Blade's unique gameplay element is that it gives players the ability to choose which two special Power Moves they'll be able to execute during a round. It also features a powerbar that fills during a bout, which can be used for A) Healing the character in the middle of a fight, B) perform a Breaker during an enemy's combo attack, C) Recover quickly from a super move that might make your character stand in a vulnerable position, or D) perform those special Power Moves that were chosen before the fight.    The game isn't bad by any means; it's actually a very responsive fighting game with solid collision detection and decent juggling moves. It's not the prettiest fighter, though, since the sprite animation seems to jerk around with very few frames to the moves. Backgrounds aren't much better, as the artwork honestly looks like it was created during the PC's shareware days. Dual Blades also attempts to push the violence factor, with finishing moves that can slice opponents apart, but it looks more silly than gross, because it's obvious that the developer just breaks the fighter sprite in two and slaps some red blotches on one of the halves. The speed of the action can't even compare with the rest of the fighting games in the genre, especially with the quick Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Mortal Kombat: Dark Alliance on their way.  The game might not be a terrible fighter, but it doesn't do anything to get people to recognize its own design elements. The characters and locations are extremely generic and the gameplay isn't much more than a slower-paced version of Street Fighter-meets-Samurai Shodown. Only if you're an absolute fanatic for all things fighting should you bother with Dual Heroes.", "date": "Nov 1, 2002"}
