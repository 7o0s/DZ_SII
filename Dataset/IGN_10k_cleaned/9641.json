It's not a bad idea -- this title is an arcade fishing expedition -- but when I was doing it, my button taps weren't registering on the screen. Eventually, I started pounding the buttons and they'd pop up on the screen. I just figured my controller was on its last legs.   Then, I tried to drive the boat.   See, the fish aren't always biting in Monster Bass, and that means you have to pilot your boat to different sections. So, the ability to control your vessel is pretty damn important, and according to the tutorial and instruction manual, R2 accelerates your barge and L2 decelerates. I got to a point where I needed to move, climbed into the captain's chair and pressed R2. A menu popped up and the boat didn't move. I held R2 again, and the same menu popped up. I pressed L2, and the boat began moving in reverse. I proceeded to press every other button on the controller and found no way to make the boat go forward. I switched to the secondary control scheme -- L2 for forward and R2 for reverse -- and found I could now go forward but not back.      The default controls are broken in Cabela's Monster Bass. That is the attention to detail put into this game.   Okay, that might be a bit of a low blow, but busted controls are a pretty big sticking point with any game. Monster Bass isn't just about struggling with getting your sea legs, though; the game is -- shocker -- all about fishing.   Now, if you're a traditionalist who is looking for a good ol' sim of what it's like to hit the open water, you can stop reading right here. Monster Bass is all about high scores and racking up combos. You'll start on your boat, pull back on your right stick to swing your arm and push the stick forward to cast. With your lure in the water, you can begin reeling it in with L2, and if there's no initial interest from the surrounding fish, a left analog stick prompt will pop up and you can pull off a combo to attract Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike or whatever other gilled creature is in the area.   Here, fishy. The fish bites, and a meter with a reel in the center pops up. You need to pull the right stick in whatever direction the meter tells you to keep the battle between you and the fish in the center. If it gets away from the center, past the green area and into the red, you risk your line breaking. While this struggle's going down, you need to be reeling in -- which ups your risk for landing in the red -- and occasionally dealing with button combos that pop up on the screen. Nail the combos and you'll get more points as well as a weaker foe -- a series of dots at the top of the screen represent how much fight Flipper's got in him.    You now know everything you need to know about fishing in Monster Bass. You'll take these incredibly simple techniques into Tournament Fishing, which is made up of six levels -- Lake Wylie, Clear Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, Lake Amistad, Lake Logan Martin and Lake Okeechobee -- and alternate those levels through three difficulties that challenge you with objectives such as catching a certain number of fish or a bringing in a specific weight. There'll be the occasional reward -- a new lure or worm -- but you'll never be able to pop open a tackle box and mess with your setup. There's no story, although you will have a reputation meter and saved stats. You just go out there and fish for the highest score.   There's no multiplayer, but if you don't feel like doing the tournament mode, you can jump into Open Fishing (free play) or Quick Challenge.   Believe it or not, most of that was the good news about Monster Bass. It's not that it's a terrible game, but it certainly looks and feels like a neglected product. You'll get a fish to the boat and haul it out of the water, but the catch won't actually sit in your hand; instead it'll just hover next to it. The casting tutorial will tell you that the amount of pull you put on your stick will govern how far you cast and it'll even show a cast power meter, but in practice, these options don't pop up. All my casts went long. My bassmaster has no short game.     As you putter around the lake, you can check out a Fishfinder to see where the fish are and pull up a laughably simple/cartoony GPS to get a view of the area, but both features are just there and not too helpful. The same can be said for the Angler's Den, an extras room that looks like it's straight out of a comic strip and showcases your unlocked rods and such.    Beyond that, the graphics are blurry and lack detail. You never feel like you're on one of the nation's waterways. You know you're just on a carpet of water with some poorly cut tree textures on the shores.Monster Bass is a budget title -- it'll only set you back about $30 -- and it shows. The graphics are lackluster, the game offers no incentive to keep playing, the replay value is practically nonexistent, and the broken controls are unforgivable. Yes, wrangling a fish onboard works and is fun enough thanks to heavy use of rumble and trying to pull off some combos, but the rest of the package is a letdown. If you or your child is aching for a simple fishing title, this one might fit the bill  once it goes on clearance.", "date": "Nov 28, 2007"}
