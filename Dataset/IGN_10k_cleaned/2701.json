The even more blood splattered Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now, takes the series into the 3D accelerated realm with more open arenas, better cars, and bloodier ways to mow down pedestrians.   Carpocalypse Now is all about destruction. Destroying other cars. Destroying buildings. Destroying pedestrians. This is the kind of game that Congress gets upset about, and rightly so. There are more ways to crush, run down, and otherwise maim innocent people in this game than in real life. Ostensibly, you're supposed to be racing a circuit, the first one across the finish line wins. In practice, driving around causing destruction and racking up points is the way to win because it is easy to pick up additional time for the track. Chances are also high that you will eliminate your competitors long before you run out of time.   Vehicle repairs, power ups and upgrades are all purchased with points that you earn by destroying opponent cars or running down foot traffic. Pile drive a walking man into a building and you can pick up a quick 700 points. Hit and runs are easy and pay 200 a pop. The more finesse or style you exhibit in your antisocial driving, the more points you're likely to get. The only thing keeping this game off the banned list is that the people you're running over are very cartoonish, with a low polygon count and a walk as stiff as Al Gore's. To enhance their cartoon nature, you can pick up powerups like drunken pedestrians, big head pedestrians, and giant pedestrians, that all do pretty much what they say. Big head pedestrians take on a distinctly Japanese anime look. Giant pedestrians are large and easy to run down and the drunken ones, well, let's just say the they never see you coming.   Carpocalypse Now doesn't require 3D acceleration beyond the Rage II or Rage Pro built into most PowerPCs, but the frame rate is painfully low, even on a G3 266. If you have a Voodoo 1 or 2 card, the game looks great. Frame rates for the Voodoo 1 on a G3 266 average about 18fps, and on the Voodoo 2, about 25fps. Owners of Blue and White G3s will probably have the best experience, with a high frame rate, low 30s, and excellent 3D rendering.   Although the violence in Carmageddon 2 may earn it a mention on the floor of the House, the game is mindless fun with a heavy dose of violence. While not for everyone, game players with a healthy grasp on reality will find a lot to enjoy.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
