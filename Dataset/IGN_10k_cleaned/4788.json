It's got a lot to live up to, since EA Sports' own NHL '99 beat the game to store shelves.  Like NHL '99, NHL FaceOff '99 builds on its existing design and adds new features to its line-up. In 989 Studio's case, the developers have added play-by-play from Devil's broadcaster Mike Emrick and ESPN's Darren Pang, where nearly every shot is called with professionalism. The team also tweaked graphics and controls, naturally, as well as offer new TV-style cut-aways during stoppage of plays. Obviously all the new additions to the NHL, including the new crease, gap behind the net, and the new expansion team, the Nashville Predators, are here as well.  The Icon passing and switching features are back, something that NHL Faceoff can truly call its own. This year's hockey race is really close...a first for the PlayStation. EA Sports' series dominated the genre last year, and it's obvious that 989 Studios looked at that game carefully when it sketched out its design document for NHL FaceOff '99. In fact, NHL FaceOff '99 is so similar to NHL '98, it's truly scary.Obviously, the best thing going for Faceoff is its superior graphics engine. It's cleaner, faster, and smoother, and truly blows away what NHL '99 dished out. The default speed is too fast, actually, but you can tweak the pace of the game to suit your tastes. Most hockey nuts will turn the speed down to something a little more realistic.On the downside, the motion capturing is pretty lame, especially when looking at the players from a close camera shot. I also REALLY hate the way the glass shakes on every check into the boards  it looks like jello, and it's very, very distracting. The puck physics are nothing special  you'll notice some oddities during goals where it just stops dead in the net. Sure, I'm picking nits, but hey, NHL '99 got that right last year.Control is nice and tight (they've swiped the same button scheme as EA's series... smart move), but I feel the players don't quite set up plays as nicely as they should  and players go offsides a bit too much for my tastes. And penalty calls are rarely made. Shame. And the default camera angle is almost unplayable, since it follows the action too close to follow. Thankfully you can switch the camera, but you have to do it every single game.As long as the hockey season lasts, this is going to be a debatable topic  which is better, NHL '99 or FaceOff '99? Well, in my opinion, NHL '99 is a disappointment, but it's still the hockey game to own. FaceOff '99 is certainly a welcome surprise... the developers got almost everything right this year. Just a bit more tweaking in the AI and it could have sent NHL '99 straight to the showers.", "date": "Oct 1, 1998"}
