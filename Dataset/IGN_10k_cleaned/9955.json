This 8-bit take on professional ice hockey originally arrived on the NES just in time for Christmas in 1988, and was a welcome stocking stuffer. Even today it has legions of fans -- 20 years after its original release. Maybe it's because of the fighting.   One of the signature elements of Blades of Steel's interpretation of the NHL is its fistfights, where after two opposing players meet up on the ice in one too many high-speed collisions, they actually do throw down their gloves, put up their dukes and try not to get sent to the penalty box. The gameplay shifts from the overall camera view of the skating rink to a zoomed-in, close-up perspective of the two men, now standing and facing off against one another in a viewpoint reminiscent of Street Fighter or Urban Champion. You throw jabs and hooks with the B and A Buttons and try to land five hits before your opponent does the same. The player who loses the fight is the one who gets put in time-out for the next few minutes.   The face-off looks civilized now, but in about five minutes those guys will be trying to punch each other's lights out. Fighting isn't all there is to Blades of Steel, of course, but it's a good place to start in describing this effort's gameplay, because it's representative of the overall feel -- it's tough, no nonsense hockey that doesn't mind playing dirty. The core gameplay is a standard simulation of the sport, with five men and a goalie lining up on either side of the ice and trying to control the puck, then attempting to score by slapping shots into the opposition's net. It's focused and tight with no frills at all. The mechanics stand on their own.   And the gameplay stands in opposition to its NES-era competition as well, since players' other choice in 8-bit hockey simulation in '88 was Nintendo's own Ice Hockey. The hook of that release was its differentiated players and you could customize your squad of skaters with men who were skinny, fat or medium-sized, each of which had its own strengths and weaknesses. Blades of Steel's men are all the same shape, though. The opposition is always perfectly evenly matched, as no player has any advantage in speed or power over any other.   It boils down to straight-up skill, then, as you pass the puck from man to man (your active player blinks with a white glow to let you know who you're currently controlling) and try to advance down the ice to set up a shot on goal. When you come near enough to the net, you'll see an arrow icon moving up and down along the edge of the goal's opening -- that's where your shot will be placed, so you need to try to time your press of the A Button when the opposing goalie is clear of that same arrow.   Several presentation aspects are notable in Blades of Steel, including the game's array of teams, its difficulty selector and its halftime show. The team array is evocative of the NHL without actually being licensed -- there are eight total teams representing different cities/ states in Canada and the U.S., and their colors are set to be similar to those used on the uniforms of those same NHL franchises in those same locations two decades ago. The difficulty selector offers three options, essentially easy, medium and hard, and you'd do well to start off on easy and work your way up from there.    But the halftime show has to be the most notable of all, because Konami was shamelessly self-promotional there in the '80s. After the second period concludes, you're taken to a view of the scoreboard. Then the display gives way to various advertisements for other Konami NES games like Jackal or Contra -- or, more unexpectedly, the screen shifts to a brief playable mini-game version of Gradius. It's a fun little extra and nostalgic for old-school Konami fans.There has been a lot of emphasis put on the rivalry between Blades of Steel and Ice Hockey --  it really was a case of either/or in the '80s, as few young NES fans had the cash to be able to own both editions in their original cartridge forms. The debate still rages as to which one was really is the better game, what with Ice Hockey standing firm on its foundation of old-school Nintendo quirkiness and Blades of Steel offering a more standard, focused, grittier play experience. As for our verdict, we say flip a coin. You'll end up having solid 8-bit hockey fun no matter which way you go.", "date": "Feb 5, 2008"}
