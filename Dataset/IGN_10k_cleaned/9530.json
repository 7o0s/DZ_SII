Having mastered the elemental arts of both Air and Waterbending through the events of the first season of Avatar: The Last Airbender on Nickelodeon, the young hero Aang has now set his sights on the Earth Kingdom. There, he hopes to find a new teacher, one who'll instruct him in the stone-shaping and mountain-moving ways of Earthbending  and bring him one step closer to becoming the true reincarnation of the Avatar of legend, the only warrior who ever mastered all four elements. Avatar: The Last Airbender -- The Burning Earth focuses on this new quest to find an Earthbending master and the events of the cartoon show's second season, and does so by putting players into fights. Lots and lots of fights.   It's a brawler design, essentially. And, essentially, the same style of game as the first Avatar title on Wii, which was a launch title for the system nearly one year ago. But unlike that first Avatar adventure, this time Aang isn't all alone. Each action stage in The Burning Earth instead features two simultaneously active heroes, working together.    You'll get the original trio of main characters  Aang, the Avatar-in-training who's most adept at manipulating the wind; Katara, his trusted friend who excels at Waterbending; and Sokka, the goofy-but-lovable guy will a love for throwing boomerangs. But new characters also join up along the way, including Toph, the blindfighting Earthbender and Jet, the gang's sometimes-foe, sometimes-friend who dual-wields a couple of hook swords.   You even get to surf around on Appa, the flying bison, on occasion. That's an interesting event. And especially interesting for established fans of the show, who'll love being able to simultaneously command such a variety of different heroes this time around, instead of just one character at a time.  But the new variety also introduces some new issues.   Freestyle flying bison surfing  the sport of the future.  In single player mode, you can swap back and forth between the two current characters at any time by pressing the Wii Remote's Plus Button. The character not being directly controlled will follow along through A.I., fighting, moving and jumping across gaps automatically. In two player mode, both characters will, of course, be controlled by human players  which is preferable, because the auto A.I. kind of stinks.   A negative leveled against last year's Avatar title was its strict focus on single player brawling, and lack of an option for two players to work together. But now, with that option in place, it's almost a necessity  because your partner character will often just get in the way or do nothing at all if you're playing by yourself. The A.I. handles moving and jumping well enough. But once those lots and lots of fights start happening, they'll quickly get themselves into trouble.   Especially in boss battles, where the rather casual difficulty of the rest of the game is elevated into an actual challenge. Surviving these encounters with lords of the Fire Nation, giant swamp monsters and the like often means having quick timing to dodge deadly attacks, or getting into specific position to deal back damage yourself. But you'll be on your own here, either having to ignore your partner's cries of pain or regularly shift control back and forth to balance things out.   So two player co-op is the way to go  and the game's puzzle designs support that focus. In-between those many battles, you'll come across basic challenges that task you to interact with the environment and your partner in some simple way. Having Aang blast a gust of air into a pipe while Sokka simultaneously pulls a lever, having Katara focus her Waterbending skill into creating a bridge of ice, et cetera.  Each character has his or her own unique abilities, which are also upgradeable over time  and that's a good thing, because where the simplicity of design is beneficial to the games' puzzles, it's detrimental to the game's fighting engine.   The brawling is too straightforward and repetitive in The Burning Earth. You mash the B Trigger to string together basic punching and kicking combos, or tilt the Wii Remote in a quick motion to perform a ranged attack. That's pretty much it. The earnable upgrades to each character's signature abilities give the design just a bit more depth, as you earn points over time that can be allotted to either enhancing your melee, distance, or special attacks. But these enhancements aren't dramatic or different enough  Aang's big blast of air becomes a slightly bigger blast of air. Or Sokka gets one more spinning kick thrown into his standard melee combo.   What's more, the controls cued to the Wiimote's motion sensitivity are often hard to handle. Each character's chargeable distance strike is activated by holding the Remote vertically for a few seconds, then bringing it back down to a horizontal position to execute the attack. But the strike will register and begin charging even if you just slightly move the Remote up a bit while adjusting your hand during play  you could, and often will, find yourself locked into the charging animation in the middle of a battle when you didn't intend to. Until you learn to keep the controller perfectly level as you play.So there's a fair amount of frustration still involved in playing Avatar on Wii. The positive spin, though, is that progress has clearly been made  the addition of two-player support is a major enhancement that can make this adventure fun to play in spite of its issues, and was sorely lacking in last year's product. And though the brawling is still pretty basic it has, at least, adopted now some simple taken-for-granted actions like jumping, which the launch window Avatar also didn't have. We'd still love to see the character of Aang used to more of his full potential, as the show's representation of him as an incredibly capable and diverse hero is poorly depicted by a brawler who's restricted to only the simplest of straight-shooting blasts of air. But with the continued success of the Avatar cartoon show, it seems that THQ will get the chance to continue making that steady progress. Just let the Airbender actually wield his full range of skill and fly for the third game, will you guys?", "date": "Nov 15, 2007"}
