{"name": "Fire Pro D", "name_review": "Fire ProWrestling D (import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/14/fire-prowrestling-d-import", "text": "Not since the days of Jimmy ~Superfly~ Snooka, Cactus Jack, Hulk Hogan (in his ~golden shorts~ years), ~The American Dream~ Dusty Rhodes, and, of course, Ricky ~The Dragon~ Steamboat have I've been really keeping in touch with my ~rasslin~ roots.  Oh sure, with the explosion of pro wrestling, it's hard not to hear about current favs like The Rock, Goldberg, Stone Cold Austin, and many others.  And you see all these new names when you play the current crap of wrestling games; yeah, there are exceptions but overall, there are way too many bad wrestling games than too many good ones.  Perhaps it is because developers are too concerned with depicting wrestlers in all their 3D glory than concentrating on gameplay mechanics and features.  Cuz that's certain the route where Fire ProWrestling D for the Dreamcast has taken... and it's one that I have enjoyed, even if the visuals haven't made that so-called ~evolution~ from 2D to 3D graphics.  Though there are a few 3D elements in the game (most noticeable in the intro sequences where wrestlers walk toward the ring), the games visuals are all in 2D.  That shouldn't surprise anyone who has played any of the Fire ProWrestling series, one that dates back to the days of the TurboGrafx 16.  Although the visuals remain in that 2D nature, Fire ProWrestling D features better looking characters; all wrestlers are much larger than in the previous version on the PlayStation Fire ProWrestling G, and most feature a bit more animation as well.  Not to say the animation is up to Capcom Street Fighter III standards and in that sense, the animation could be a bit more fluid  this is the Dreamcast were talking about.  But even a huge improvement in graphics is unimportant, so long as Fire ProWrestling D keeps the great play mechanics and features that has made Fire ProWrestling so loved.  And dear readers, it blows my mind how many new gameplay mechanics and features have been added Fire ProWrestling D.  The gameplay of Fire ProWrestling is a combination of timing and an unseen ~roshambo~ of sorts.  Wrestlers have three levels of attack: light, strong, and heavy.  When not grappling, wrestlers will attack with strikes, kicks, and other assorted punishing non-grappling moves (i.e. the clothesline).  Grappling is done simply by walking into a wrestler and the second fighters are locked, it's a contest of who can get the first wrestling move command off as well as what level of attack is being used.  On average, each wrestler has well over 20 different techniques to use and when you have well over 70 wrestlers from various Japanese and US leagues, there are a ton of different techniques and moves to use.  This is particularly true with Fire ProWrestling D now that it includes shoot-fighters and wrestler/fighting hyrbrids similar to the fighters in UFC.  Controls have remained relatively the same, though I find Fire Pro Wrestling D a bit more difficult than the previous versions; I don't know if it's because I haven't played the game in almost a year, or maybe it's my natural process of video game skill deterioration with age.  But after a few games, I gradually got back in my groove and decided to go to the mother-of-all battle royals, just one of the several features in Fire ProWrestling D.  Long-time fans of Fire ProWrestling will be a little disappointed that the game only allows four human players to battle at the same time even though the game can have up to eight characters (four human, four computer) battle it out at the same time.  While this is a bit of a letdown, players of Fire ProWrestling D will hardly notice now that they have a landslide of features.  You have various gameplay modes (One Night Tournament, Battle Royal, Victory Road, etc.), various types of matches (Barbed wire, Exploding Cage, etc.), and of course, the awesome edit mode that nearly every current wrestling game has ~bit off~.  The edit mode allows you to create your own wrestlers, and the number of different options to change your wrestler is staggering.  Now, you can also create your own league of wrestlers with a custom logo you can design from scratch (and yes, you can finally use the DC mouse to help design the logo).  And now, there's the Network Mode; although you cannot play online with Fire ProWrestling D, with this mode you'll be able to get online to Spike's official site to exchange wrestler data and download new moves!  It's truly a shame that a game like Fire ProWrestling D will never come to the US.  Beyond the 2D nature of the game, comes the licensing fees of WWF and WCW wrestlers found in the game.  But perhaps it's better than it Fire ProWrestling D be known and played by a select few who don't care too much about the proper entrance themes and the drama that comes with watching wrestling, and are more concerned with awesome gameplay features, hilarious 2D visuals, and solid gameplay fun.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 14, 2001"}
