For gamers, it's an evergreen title with endless replay value. And that's the curse for EA Mobile, owners of the mobile Tetris license. Mobile gamers buy it only once and then play the hell out of it. To pay for that very expensive license, though, EA Mobile needs people to buy Tetris more than once -- which is why you see variations on the perfect puzzler popping up on the decks over and over, such as Tetris Deluxe and Tetris Mania.   It's very important to note that Tetris Mania does not include the original game of Tetris. Instead, it offers three variations on the classic, each with varying levels of success. Cascade, Sticky, and Fusion Tetris all take the established formula and put a little twist on it, and Tetris Mania offers two ways to play each game. You can just dig in and play in Mania mode, or try Challenge mode, which sets up goals and time limits. Challenge is definitely meant to be tackled after gaining proficiency with individual game via Mania mode.   Cascade Tetris adds gravity to the regular puzzle game. When you complete one or more lines in the matrix (also referred to as the ~well~), any negative space directly below the cleaned line(s) is filled in by unsupported squares above it. This offers multiple ways to clear lines, adding an interesting wrinkle to the formula. No longer do you need to feel bad about the negative space in the matrix (which reveals the true genius behind Tetris, you actually have a bizarre emotional response to blocks). Those missed spaces are now new opportunities for scoring points if you can properly set up cascading blocks. Cascade Tetris is easily the best of the three Tetris tweaks in Mania.   Sticky Tetris is not as good as Cascade, but certainly not unplayable. You still need to clear the screen, but the blocks that fall into the matrix are composed often of different colored squares. When you slam a piece into place, the colored squares actually fall apart and drop into the matrix. Squares of the same color stick together, though, so you can have some interesting globs of color in the matrix, making some garish negative space. If you attach 10 squares, they achieve critical mass and vanish, which offers another way to clear the screen than just lines. Sticky Tetris starts off with a few errant squares in the bottom of the matrix, complicating things further.   Fusion Tetris, the final game, just felt off. You have atom blocks in the matrix that are activated by dropping a fusion block or another atom block next to it. So, not only do you have regular pieces dropping into the matrix, but also these single-square atom blocks. These blocks are affected by gravity, like in Cascade, and you can break apart activated atoms if you clear a line. It's hard to explain concisely and even harder to warm up to. It's by far my least favorite of the three variations.   Tetris Mania allows you to maintain one ~frozen~ game, a very cool feature for when you have to stop playing or take a call. If you try to start a different game in any of the other categories, though, you lose the saved game. Tetris Mania also tracks scores, so you can measure your skills.   The game screen looked clear and colorful on a Sony Ericsson S710a. The blocks are bright and well-defined. The matrix takes up a good portion of the screen and the wrapper graphics are not distracting. The music is also solid. Tetris Mania has very good presentation, which is something I expect out of EA Mobile games.  Tetris Mania is hardly a replacement for the original -- the puzzler has no equal, including these three variations on the game mechanics that charmed the world. Cascade is the best of the three and Sticky isn't outright bad (like Fusion), but it's certainly not that engaging. Fusion is a mess. If you already have the original Tetris on your handset and absolutely crave more block-dropping action set within the Tetris universe, Tetris Mania is a decent follow-up purchase. But I'd have to recommend other puzzlers out there, such as Gunpey EX and Zuma, before suggesting you lay down your dollars for Tetris Mania.", "date": "Sep 6, 2006"}
