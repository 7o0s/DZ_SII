And Midway's biggest arcade football fan is here to write about it. After re-reading my last review, I have to say, we were just a little too enthusiastic about last year's game, rating it with an impressive 9.4.  Wow! Well, it was a great game, and so is its successor. But this game won't receive that high of a score, even though it's better. Why? Chalk it up to over-enthusiasm.  Gameplay After wasting an inhuman amount of hours playing NFL Blitz 99, the arcade game, I can play the game in my frickin' sleep. NFL Blitz 2000, the home port, brings all of the crazy tackles, hilarious sayings, and simple gameplay right back, only this time with more offensive plays, more options, a real multiplayer feature, and a better presentation.  New Plays First, the plays. This year, designer and lead programmer Mark Termel has done ~gud.~ Last year's sensation was shallow in the quantity of plays, and this year's version takes care of that, sweet  and simple. With a choice of 27 offensive plays, plus nine more of your own, players simply can't complain. Last year's play selection is there, with a few missing, and replaced by new ones that feature a different kind of gameplay. These plays add depth behind the line of scrimmage. Hand-offs, short passes, and multiple passes add to the arcade mayhem, as the defense scrambles to figure out just who has the ball. A smarter sense of play design also creates for more down-the-field blocks, single-side floods, and more creative, on-the-fly gameplay. This also means there are less straight forward running plays, but that doesn't mean runs are any less effective. It's just the opposite. You just have to create the formation best for your hole.   The defensive plays have been smartened up, too. The defense can sense a run up the side better than last year, and is a little better with rushes, too. It's faster on the blitz. Even more annoying is that the AI defense intercepts more than last year if you're careless. In my first season game with the 49ers I threw six interceptions against the lowly Saints! Obviously, I threw too many cross-field throws and double coverage passes. Oh well, Steve Young is past his heyday. Montana was always better, anyway! (The can of worms is now open!) One last important thing - the players who are stars in the real NFL, are re-created similarly on this polygonal field. Forty-niners WR Jerry Rice, although a little slower than he used to be, is damn hard to tackle, and so is Garrison Heart. Likewise, Denver's Terrell Owens, the Lions' (former) running back star Barry Sanders is great, etc., etc. So, plays break open far more now than in the arcade version and last year's version.  Play Editor To create your own plays, a feature not available in the PS version last year, players must simply take a few minutes strategizing on the gridiron. Players can create as many as nine offensive or defensive plays at a time, by editing already laid-out plays, or creating their own. You get to name and save them to your card and they load up with a prompt screen during play. By selecting from the offensive plan, players can choose formations, such as 1 plus 1 plus 1, four linemen, or 1 WR 2 backs, for example. The play creation is easy, but it's a little slow. The biggest downfall of the created plays is that you can't see them on the regular screen when you play! You'll have to memorize them; a little hard when making snap decisions and choosing from nine!   Luckily, for those who played last year's version, this year's game is far more balanced. First, it's harder straight off the bat. Last year's version had a relatively easy Season mode, and a hellish post season. It wasn't even funny. In Blitz 2000, the teams are better balanced and the post-season is as hard as it should be. Players can still tracks the same level of stats as last year, but in a much cleaner and better thought-out interface.   Midway also has appealed to those who like variation. If you like to pass like last year, you can still do it. But Blitz Passing enables players to map a button to a receiver, a nice simple touch. A new punt meter makes for more control over the punt, a nice touch not available in NFL Blitz. Aim your punts to thwart your opponent, using placement as a little weapon, just like in the pros. A wind factor adds to the hang time, which also now has a meter to measure how long a ball spends in mid-air.   Just like in the arcade 1999 version, this year's PS Blitz supports four-person multiplayer games, two to a team. While on offense, you alternate between passer and receiver, and on defense, pick from rusher or backfield. Of course, players can still catch on fire, the new 1999 rosters have been added, as well as two new teams: The Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans. A great little trivia minigame adds to your total points.   Last year, I would have unfortunately opted for the Nintendo 64 version. It had createable plays that worked with the arcade version. This year that's changed. What makes this equal to the Nintendo 64 version is two-fold. Each version has the same amount of features, but the play is as smooth and as fast on PlayStation, and there are more movies and FMVs. The animation sequences are faster, and the overall game looks sharp and plays quick. I have to say the Nintendo 64 version looks a little sharper, but not by much. Graphics A better engine this year provides for a superior graphic appearance. Sharp looking players are short of a few animations here and there compared to the arcade machine, but since that's a Voodoo enhanced PC engine, it's no sweat. In fact, Midway has still done an excellent job of porting this game over with sweet changes and additions that make it deeper in gameplay. New tackle and touchdown animations are especially noticeable.   Overall, it looks better in every aspect. The most noticeable part is the character animations. Just like last year, a few new, more friendly tackles are present, which is fine with us. And the players simply move faster.   Last, the interface is great. It's smooth, linear and easy to follow. Last year's interface was a little more rushed and last minutes. Well, it may not have been, but it appeared that way. Selecting options is quick and logical, and the load times, although present (in any PS game), are noticeably better.  Sound Crunch! Midway's famed announcer is back with more hilarious commentary. He's great this years with several new additions, but he unfortunately says one thing too much, the HAAAAAIILLLLL Mary! I don't know how many 15-yard passes ended up with that quote. The players also say excellent new things to tick off their opponents. If you loved the first, well, shucks, you know how the saying goes. I played the beans out of the arcade game and took on the best in our company, with only a few losses. I know the dang game inside and out. Blitz 2000 is different than the arcade version, in subtle ways. Like I couldn't do my sneaky rush the passer move by busting through the line with a selection of buttons. That sucked. Still, the four-player mode is where it's at! That rocks hard. It adds a completely new depth to a game that desperately needed it. I wonder, though, about Blitz. Is it eventually going to become so filled with options and similarities to ~other~ football games that it will simply become boring and bland? Right now, it's not. NFL Blitz 2000 isn't a giant leap over last year's game, but it filled in all of the areas it needed to, making it equal to the N64 version. It's balanced, deeper, multiplayer, and still as fun as the first one.", "date": "Aug 19, 1999"}
