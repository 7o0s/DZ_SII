It's nearly always the same: some naive spiky-haired youth finds a magical sword and embarks on a daredevil quest to save the world from certain doom, invariably necessitating the demise of some mean-spirited chap in black with a cackling problem. So, when an RPG like Contact comes along, with its post-modern approach to narrative, zeitgeist videogame references and unusual visual style, it makes you sit up and take note. But can it hold your attention?   From the moment you meet the charismatic Professor, who tells you that you've actually managed to contact him via your DS, it's obvious that Contact is something of step away from the norm. For starters, you don't actually play as a traditional RPG character - instead, you act as the link between the game's two protagonists: the mysterious Professor and a young boy called Terry. Your role in this threesome of gaming fun is to guide Terry on the bottom screen (with either the touch screen or D-pad) while the Professor twitters overhead, keeping you up-to-date with events.   Unfortunately, the end result is a peculiar dichotomy between you and the game. It always feels like you're distanced from events rather than being drawn into the unfolding story of the Professor and his quest to repair his ship. You're never quite sure whether to empathise with Terry or the Professor, which is a shame because Contact has its fair share of funny moments and clever twists.   Furthermore, there are times when you don't feel like you're doing anything at all in the game. This is highlighted by the battle system - something that can often make or break an RPG. Unfortunately in Contact's case, it just doesn't cut it.   Although there's a wealth of different weapons for Terry to master, combat boils down to pressing 'B' to start an attack then watching as the sprites thrash it out between themselves, with absolutely no means of intervention until it's all over. If Terry's getting hit, there's no way to defend attacks and invariably, encouters with more powerful enemy are usually simply a matter of watching Terry's life bar slowly drain away until you decide to leg it or die.    Things wouldn't be so bad if Contact had a forgiving difficulty curve that accounted for Terry's inability to defend but it doesn't. Ironically, for all Contact's clever twists and in-jokes, it ends up being hampered by the repetitive stat-grinding gameplay of more traditional RPGs. If you don't level up enough in the early parts of the game, it becomes almost impossible later on - and when you combine this with infrequent save points, you've got a recipe for frustration.   It's a pity because, rather like the unorthadox approach to the narrative, combat system does have a lot going for it, in principle. For special attacks, you can collect stickers which are then 'pasted' onto the touch-screen, affecting your foes in various ways - enemies might turn into cows or Terry could recieve a temporary stat boost. There's also a nifty ~job~ system that sees Terry donning different outfits: dressing as a cook means he can create meals, providing energy in times of need, while donning thief clothes lets Terry unlock doors and treasure chests.      Outfits also dictate what magic attacks Terry can pull off during combat. So, if he's wearing the fireman's costume, he performs water-based spells, while dressing as a monk enables powerful punches. Alongside stickers, spells are another combat element you can influence directly, by pressing 'Y' during a duel. As you use more magical attacks, you'll become increasingly proficient with that element (fire, water, etc.) and learn new attacks. However, it's disappointing that Terry forgets them the moment he takes off his costume.   Ultimately, costumes are a fun addition that's let down by the fact you can't change outfits on the fly. Instead, each time you want to switch clothes - to overcome an obstacle or solve a puzzle - you need to warp out of a dungeon back to the Professor's spaceship then start over at the dungeon's entrance.    Of course, that does mean you'll have chance to level up a bit more - and there are tons of different stats for Terry to increase. In a nice change from tradition, you don't have a set number of experience points you need to reach the next level. Instead, rather like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, stats go up depending upon your actions. So if you like to stand around getting punched, your defensive states will slowly creep skywards.   Meanwhile, fighting with a sword improves your blade technique. It's a neat, intuitive system that responds to how you want to play the game. It's just a shame that the tedious combat system makes the whole process so dull.Ultimately, Contact is a brilliant concept that fails to live up to its initial promise. For all its quirky charms, interesting characters and gameplay innovations, there's no disguising the fact it's still a bog-standard RPG stat-grinder with a poor combat system. Admittedly, if you can slog through the repetitive dungeons then you might find solice in the deep stats system and the fun-but-flawed costumes, but take away the undoubtedly interesting presentation and its unlikely youd even be giving this a second look. Admittedly, some people might find Contact's unique approach rewarding enough in itself to warrant a play through, just don't expect gameplay that's on par with Contact's undeniable imagination injection.", "date": "Jan 22, 2007"}
