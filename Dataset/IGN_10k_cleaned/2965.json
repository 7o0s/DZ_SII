{"name": "Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure of Soccer Island", "name_review": "Go! Go! Beckham!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/24/go-go-beckham", "text": "David Beckham, an English football (that's soccer to all you Americans) player has become an instantly recognizable face in the land of royalty, scones and rain, and nearly any item with his face plastered on it will sell by the bucketload. So it was inevitable that he'd eventually find his way to becoming a main character in a game. However, what wasn't so predictable was that the game would be platformer, rather than a soccer sports game. Go! Go! Beckham! is definitely an odd breed. Features  Five worlds  47 levels  Hidden challenges Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance, Europe-only release   At first glance, Go! Go! Beckham! seems like yet another GBA cash-in (aimed only at Brits though of course). The name of the game itself will attract fans, and the box art is simplistic and cartoony, and seems to appeal to kids, the exact age group that is easily attracted by a franchise, rather than gameplay. And of course, let's not forget the fact that nigh on every other third party GBA platformers are cash-ins. It's forgivable to cast an optimistic eye over this one too. But Go! Go! Beckham can be surprisingly entertaining if you're the patient gamer.   The story is as simple as they come. The nefarious Mister Woe has taken over Soccer Island, stealing all ~precious things~, and turning all animals into monsters. David Beckham must clear each world and defeat Mister Woe to restore peace to the island.   However, beating each level isn't simply a case of running in one direction until you reach the end. Instead, you must use your skills as a soccer player and use your soccer ball to clear your way of blocks and monsters. In order to finish a level, you must hit 5 locks with your ball to activate a goal, and then kick the ball into that. Ball skills are called upon a lot, so don't think you can leave your ball behind and stroll to the finish without it. Your movement is hindered when you have the ball however; when you have it in your possession, you can't jump as high, meaning you have to kick it over large gaps before jumping over them yourself, and reclaiming it. This means that you need to switch between using the ball, and leaving it behind to clear different sections. Enemies are killed by kicking the ball at their particular weak spot, and then once they're stunned, kicking the ball at them once more. The ball can't be burst or lost at all, but David can be hurt by these enemies, so keeping your distance while attacking is the safest option.   Different ball skills are gained as you progress through the game; the most useful one being the ability to instantly warp your ball back to you by pressing B. This allows you to leave your ball behind, while you make your way across gaps more easily, and then simply warp it over to you once you need it. Other balls with different attributes can be found in certain levels, such as the rubber ball, which bounces a lot more, or the bowling ball, which destroys enemies more easily. However, they make little difference to the gameplay, as they aren't actually needed to beat any of the levels.   Although the main aim of the game is simply to clear each level, which is incredibly easy (you can beat Mister Woe in a couple of hours), Go! Go! Beckham! offers a huge treasure hunt. Although getting to the end of each level is easy, finding everything in them is not. There are seven small gems, and one big gem in each level, in addition to eggs that you receive for each enemy you defeat and treasure coins dotted around. The amount of enemies and treasure differ from level to level, but there's certainly a lot. Annoyingly, these collectables can only be picked up by the ball, meaning if you are without the ball, you can't pick them up. Even worse, you have to kick it into what you want to collect, rather than dribbling (walking with the ball) through the objects. There is a way of being able to pick things up by dribbling (a skill called ~Golden Boots~), but you have to collect 100 treasure coins first, and you lose this ability when you die, meaning you have to collect 100 coins again. This is incredibly annoying, and should be a default feature in the game rather than a temporary handicap. It lets down the game a lot, which is a shame, as it could have so easily been changed.   The visuals aren't anything special; in fact they could probably be equalled (or very nearly) on a GBC, but that's not to say they're terrible. They're simplistic, yet not too dull. They get the job done, at the very least. It's a shame that most levels look the same, but at least they're cheerful, which almost compensates for that. The sprites used are satisfactory, except for the soccer ball. Its fine most of the time, but there are some enemies that are the same size as the ball, and often, they're green. This makes me question as to why the soccer ball is a turquoise color. Soccer balls were white, last time I checked. There'll be a few times when you confuse an enemy for your ball. Not often, but irritating nonetheless.   The sound is of decent enough quality, but the tunes get repetitive quickly. They aren't terrible, by any means, but there simply isn't enough variation. Sound effects don't seem to be used much, for some reason. It's not a problem though, as they aren't needed, and chances are you'll turn the volume off because of the music anyway.   So is it worth buying? Well, chances are, you've never played a game like this (the only similar games that spring to mind are Soccer Kid, also for the GBA, and Marco's Magic Football, for the Genesis) so it's pretty hard what to expect. Bear this in mind: collecting is the heart of this game. There is no real reward to collecting everything, except a lot of pride, so a good idea is to remember how you felt about Yoshi's Story on the N64 if you played it. Did you hate it, because you beat the end boss within an hour of buying the game? Or did you love it, because hunting down all the green melons in each level was exciting? If you fall into the former category, you'll hate this game. If however, you fall into the latter, there's a chance you might enjoy tracking down everything, not stopping until you have every last collectable object. But that's if you can see past the irritation of having to collect 100 treasure coins before being able to pick up collectables without the hassle of kicking the ball at them.  Go! Go! Beckham! is aimed at (British) kids, but the gameplay will only be truly appreciated by the most patient gamer. If you enjoy scouring levels, hunting down everything, this game could be quite entertaining, regardless as to whether you care for David Beckham or not. If you're the kind of person whose idea of a perfect GBA platform game is running to the end of a level, or having to collect only a few things, you'll probably get bored of this within minutes. The decision to only enable players to collect items by dribbling, once they've got 100 treasure coins is a huge pain, which will test your patience even moreso. However, if you can look past this, and enjoy the collecting aspect for what it is, you might just enjoy this. It's by no means a first class title, but it still beats out the vast majority of third party GBA platformers.", "date": "Sep 24, 2002"}
