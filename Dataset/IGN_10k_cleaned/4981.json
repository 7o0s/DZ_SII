In his time, high society literally lives above menial laborers and the law is comprised of headhunters -- glorified bounty hunters that make the rules as they go along. Jack might have been a laughably interesting character on his own in the original Headhunter, but Redemption partners him with Leeza X, an underprivileged, disadvantaged youth from deep inside the troubled man's grim past. Together they fight the evil bottom feeders of The Below, unravel a typically gamey plotline, and do things future lawmen (and women) do, like shoot hundreds of bad people in the face and crotch areas.  Take tough characters, throw them against tough enemies, add a little saving of the city / country / planet / universe / multiverse, and you have a magic formula for videogaming success. Unfortunately, some unruly gremlin threw a few monkey wrenches into Headhunter's clockwork cash-in plan. The result is a game that walks a tightrope. To the left lies a nice cushy duvet of warm goodness. To the right, beyond the swirling clouds of Mordor, there sits a bottomless chasm of despair. At any moment Headhunter could topple over, one way or the other.   First, Leeza X needs to be drug into the forest and left at the mercy of wild baboons. It takes a special kind of complete and total moron to really infuriate a gamer just by speaking in an action title. Had I been subjected to listen to another teen angst addled line delivered with all the overly emotional and ironically flat skill only a lobotomized parrot could have done, I'd have freed her from her insane asylum prison and purchased the C-17 cargo ship myself. We're going to Africa, Leeza! Tell me, do you like angry monkeys? It's almost as if no one ever bothered to listen to her completed work, especially as it played against the beer swilling Eastwood imitation that is Mr. Wade. Leeza, please go mute. Embrace self-imposed silence. You'll improve the planet Earth for us all.  Grug?  The dialogue becomes such an annoyance, I found myself forgetting why I was even playing the game. During every inconsequential, uninformative cutscene I either madly giggled at the circus playing out before me or busied myself by desperately trying to conjure up some more powerful form of voodoo to dispatch these clearly evil spirits. Since paying attention to the plot by isn't going to happen, let's focus on the game.  There are times when this third-person shooter works so right that it's plain exhilarating. It's a kind of action that focuses more on drawn-out, dodge and cover gunfights than your typical ~let's run in two steps behind the flying bullets and see what happens~ game. Both Leeza and Jack stand with a certain kind of royally tough presence in the middle of battle, as if they were in a permanent vogue. It's empowering. The weapons even feel fantastic. Gunshots emit heavy bass as shells click hard and ricochets twang with clarity. Puffs of smoke waft off the burning muzzles of long-fired machineguns, and there is the prerequisite number of exploding pipes and barrels littering the game's many locales. But, just when this warm streak starts to run hot, Headhunter manages to flop on its back like a fish out of water.   Between all the hall fights, opened up skirmishes and quick sprints to cover, there lies a slumbering beast that's never frightened of rearing its nasty head. I call it the, ~Me No Control And Looky Monster.~   Headhunter uses a setup that's pretty absurd. The left analog stick handles movement, and the right a limited kind of clunking free-look. You can't even just shoot this way, though. Oh no, you must first lock-on a target by holding a button down and haphazardly moving the right analog stick toward the enemy you wish to shoot. Once you've got him, you can fire -- just don't try looking around or moving too much after you've established that precious lock, because that will make the Control And Looky Monster rather sour.   Many hours into the title I still found myself partaking in fights where I'd be admirably handing out the business only to suddenly be spun around and accosted by a damn concrete wall that old Wade or young Leeza decided to run into for no reason. The quick jerks, sudden pans, and heavy reliance on computer automation in place of an old-fashioned point and shoot mechanic really hurt. Then again, this automated shot can actually help.       Again, the point of Headhunter isn't to stand blasting, it's to wall-cling on just about anything, peek around corners, choose targets, wait for the swaying reticle to fall over the faces of the damned, and then noisily fire off large puffs of smoke so that you can see the nicely animated aftermaths. For this, the lock-on system that emphasizes positional combat works great. But then the old Looky Monster splashes up out of the bog, forces the player off his wall, swings the camera about and then the bullets start hitting just about everything. This kind of gameplay is commonly referred to as, ~Neat. Cool. Awesome...What in all hell is happening!?! I didn't do that!?!~ It's just bizarre. Playing five quick minutes of Headhunter is like flipping a coin. Every five minutes is different from the five that came before it. The game erratically changes gears so quickly there's just no way to really hate or appreciate it. It's this cool assemblage of pleasant, memorable action rammed head-on by this jumble of camera madness and control twitching. The end result, in terms of play, is a game with some distinct and downright enjoyable highlights, but with cracks and some utterly confusing design choices.  In addition to the action (and that blasted Leeza), Headhunter also offers a variety of puzzles. In fact, every level is basically one giant puzzle comprised of a lot of smaller puzzles. None of the challenges are particularly challenging by design, but they do push the otherwise A to B adventure into the land of glorified fetch quests. For as solid as some these objectives may be on paper, there're still a bunch of problems. Looky Monster's cousins, the Grumpy Map of Lost Souls and the Didn't Look in Every Cranny Goblin are coming to town.   The only way you're ever going to know where to go in Headhunter is by wandering around trying to open every single door in sight, for the in-game map is about as informative as an upside down chocolate sundae. Thankfully, it's not hard to scoop the banana aside and figure out what you have to do once you realize where that doing will need to take place, anyway.   Come Hither  Another issue I had with Headhunter was that despite the directed structure of the game, I often found myself aimlessly meandering about simply because I overlooked a destructible window that looks exactly like an indestructible one, passed by some tiny spinning keycard, or inadvertently neglected to scan the one stupid component of the one stupid machine in the entire level that allows me to move forward. Oh yes, there is scanning.   This ~Metroid rocks because I can pause the game every five seconds to learn all about some superfluous space flower~ design philosophy that helped clone Beyond Good & Evil needs to stop immediately, because games like Headhunter are taking it way too far. It's so outrageous here that it's not even possible to manipulate some items without first scanning them. Stop, look around in static first-person, scan, shoot or blow up the thing you just scanned, repeat.  Thank goodness that despite these problems, the in-action artificial intelligence, graphics, and sound (save for anything that speaks), are all up to specifications. There's a nice, soft, clean look about the PS2 game, though it won't quickly impress Xbox owners, despite the slightly beefed up framerate and smoother lines. And while we've talked about the sound of weapons before, I haven't gotten into the AI. When not fighting they wander around on predefined patrol routes, but when in combat, they actually have some life.   Enemies duck, roll, retreat, try and out flank the player, attack in groups, lob grenades, use a variety of cover, and even wait for Jack or Leeza to pull back from a lean before they come rushing it. It's all nice stuff... Then the Grumpy Map of Lost Souls and the Didn't Look in Every Cranny Goblin along with their cousin the Me No Control And Looky Monster show up, the party crashing bastards. Headhunter is a strangely appealing, almost broken mess of a game. It has a very specific kind of action that's different and charming. But this has also allowed the developers to create a new set of control and camera issues future developers will have to contend with. It hits, it misses, it hits, and then it misses again.Despite all the problems, it's still a game worth looking into and not for its unending string of puzzles and fetch quests and mini-games, nor for its atrocious dialogue or its rather ridiculous story, but because it offers a very specific kind of action that isn't too bad when taken in moderation and looked at objectively.", "date": "Sep 16, 2004"}
