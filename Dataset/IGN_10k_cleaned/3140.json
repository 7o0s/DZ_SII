That's the good news. The bad news is Phantom Crash's extremely limited number of relatively tiny arenas keeps the action cramped and cozy with no chance of parole. In the end, Phantom Crash offers a nice range of accessible and hardcore mech battling but comes up a notch below what we were expecting.  Gameplay  There can be no discussion about how Phantom Crash plays until we first go over what this game is about.  It's an alternate future and the streets of Tokyo are a wasteland where daring young hipsters (think Jet Set Radio Future's skating alterna-kids) battle in heavily armed mini mechs (Scoot Vehicles) for a broadcast audience. There are plenty of personalities and their interactions with you and each other ends up being one of the most annoying parts of the entire game. There's no voice, so you have to A button your way through countless and often pointless text conversations involving interspecies love affairs, crushes and hurt feelings among characters with names like Lunch, Greek and Salsa. There are pilots as well as their A.I. constructs with animal-based personalities that sort of ride shotgun with them in the Scobees like R2D2 in an X-wing. This wouldn't be so weird if all of these characters didn't talk so damn much about dumb things.  These text conversations are somewhat helpful in the beginning because they serve as your guide to all things Phantom Crash and the developers wanted to make sure you have as much of an understanding of the game as possible. Plus, a quick tutorial is never more than a few button presses away.  The Scoot Vehicle aka Scobee or SV is the star of this show. It's a mini-mech between 10-15 tons so they won't do much against the behemoths of MechAssault or Steel Battalion, but they can be outfitted with different legs, main hulls, backpack weapons and arm weapons. All of these parts can be further upgraded or downgraded to make them lighter and quicker and less durable or heavier and tougher and more powerful. All of this is paid for with funds you win during battles in one of three arenas: Aqua Line, Shibuya and Shinjuku. The whole economic system ends up functioning very much like Gran Turismo's with players being compelled to hurry up and earn victories so they can spend money upgrading their vehicles with cool stuff.  But unlike the PS2 racer, Phantom Crash adds several interesting twists to the shopping mechanism. First off there are only 3 manufacturers of SVs, Kojima, American Stars and Il Ventuno to buy from. When you buy parts, it's important to keep everything in the same family. So all of the rocket launchers, shotguns, lances, drills, roller feet, hover legs and other parts will have to match the company and model of your Scobee. The lack of companies and models isn't a factor since once you start racking up the dollars you will be able to buy so many new parts for your vehicle that you can completely remodel it into something never seen before. Plus you can sell parts you don't need for some extra cash. Although with the ability to store several Scobees in your garage, you'll never know when those spare parts will come in handy.  Weight limitations prevent you from simply saving up and buying four rapid fire nuclear cluster bomb guns and dominating the game. Your SV's frame can only handle so much weight, most of it coming from the body of the Scobee itself. Upgrading the leg modules can improve the carrying capacity a little but beyond that, you're going to have to be wise about what you want to use and pay attention to your vehicle's specs whilst shopping. It's not uncommon to buy some kick ass new weapon only to find out that it puts your SV over the weight limit. The cool thing about PC is that you can still pilot it into battle but you're mobility and leaping ability will be severely limited. That big gun better be worth it.   Phantom Crash operates on a day-to-day system where you can compete in one battle each day. After your match is over, your character automatically goes to sleep and wakes up the next day with a new slate of matches. This makes shopping for new parts at the Wild Machines parts shop a different experience every day. The CPU is fond of showcasing some fancy new tantalizing weapon, like an arm-mounted rocket launcher, for some ridiculous price knowing damn well you haven't been playing long enough to earn that much scratch. By the time you kill and save and kill some more to get the money --usually a matter of a few days-- the item has suddenly disappeared from the store's inventory. Be patient and it will come back but the kicker is you have to keep that money from burning a hole in your pocket while you wait.   The battling itself in Phantom Crash is fast and furious in the single player game and even more so in four player splitscreen games. The controls are extremely intuitive with left and right trigger firing the SVs left and right arm weapons and the Y and B buttons firing the left and right shoulder weapons of your vehicle. Since each of those positions can be its own unique weapon, the skill in Phantom Crash then becomes timing which weapons you want to fire for greatest effect. Launching a volley of rockets off the left shoulder and attacking with your machine gun right arm while they're in flight will be a priceless skill. The controls for your mech are a variation on the system from Halo with left analog stick moving and right analog stick aiming and they're extremely responsive. Circle strafing, using a speed boost or jump in the heat of battle are all pieces of cake and should be since enemies in Phantom Crash are at least as quick and agile as you will be in your Scobee.  We're this far into the review and we're just now getting into the optic camouflage in Phantom Crash. It's an important tool that can of course be upgraded, but it also provides one of the prettiest special effects in the game. Like The Predator, you can see right through a cloaked mech but the outline will be barely visible. When cloaked, Scobees are also invisible to everybody's directional threat detector on the targeting reticle. It changes from yellow to red when an enemy is nearby and serves as the only kind of radar in the game.  The matches operate like free for all deathmatches where there are players already competing when you just happen to drop in for your session. The coolest twist to the gameplay here is that you can exit a match whenever you like --as in before you take too much damage. But that's the only match you'll be competing in for that day, so if you paid an entry fee to get in or if you really needed some money to buy something, you're stuck until the next day. The good Phantom Crash player will go ~rumbling~ and rack up lots of kills and get out before his Scobee is completely destroyed. You earn  money for each kill and bigger targets bring bigger dollars. When you lose a limb or your SV blows up you have to pay for repairs which are automatically deducted from your winnings and/or your cash reserves you had coming into the match. Last long enough in a match and one of the top pilots, known as ~area rankers,~ will enter the match to go against some worthwhile competition. Nail one of these guys and you will be in the money.   Graphics  The Scoot Vehicles are extremely detailed and animated beautifully considering, once again, there are no such things as mechs. The environments are detailed but still extremely gray and bland at the same time. Let's just say the battle arenas convey the feeling of a drab, futuristic Tokyo too well for it to be intentional.   When you switch into one of the alternate camera positions, and fire your weapons you will see arm weapons reaching out and recoiling as they fire machine gun rounds. Safety doors on missile tubes will open up with each volley of missile you fire and immediately close again. Shoulder weapons that raise and lower with the aiming mechanism, ricocheting shell casings, smoking barrels and taillights round out the little things you'll notice about Phantom Crash that will make you smile.   Sure it's a dirty future for Shinjuku and Shibuya but this is Xbox and there are only three environments (four if you count the training area) to deal with. Why then are we treated to blurry backgrounds, and occasional splashes of color from graffiti every now and then. Multiple shades of Grimy Gun Metal Gray or Bombed Out Beige would've been very nice, but instead wall textures are used over and over again. Perhaps its only noticeable because there are so few environments. But if that's the case then perhaps Genki should've done more to make those three arenas more engaging.   Sound  The Dolby Digital separation is wonderful but since there are literally no voices in this game, we're left to enjoy an assortment of beeps, blips and battle sounds surrounding us.   The Scobees themselves make plenty of noise with all kinds of audio cues and alarms to alert you to incoming missiles, target lock-ons and other dangers during a battle. The locomotion of each SV, whether it hovers, walks or rolls, has its own sound effect to go with it as well. The explosions and weapon sounds are all well done but when the battle gets hectic it quickly gets garbled up.   The music in Phantom Crash was quite obviously a priority for the developers since there is a full fledged music store in the game where you can select from dozens of tracks. New tracks can be programmed into your own custom radio station that will play during fights. Some of the artists are real, some aren't, but all sound like something you'd find on Japanese radio. I've never wanted customizable soundtracks in a game as much as I did in Phantom Crash. Fans of the genre will be pleased, the rest will be driven to the edge of insanity by the music selection. Phantom Crash is an interesting take on the mech combat genre and doesn't get bogged down with all kinds of pretense some mech games (fans?) can be known for. The ways that you can customize your Scobee are far too numerous to list here, but let's just say it's more than most people would expect. Furthermore the fighting is engaging and like any good game, requires a fair amount of skill that has to be developed and refined over time to be successful. But for some reason, I can't help but feel PC comes up short overall because of those three arenas. It almost makes the game seem incomplete, like it's a demo and the full version is on the way in a few weeks. But this just isn't the case and as a result the fun I had building and tinkering with my mech just doesn't last because battling over and over again in the same levels wears thin very quickly. I thought Midway sports games had cornered the market on fun 'n shallow, but Phantom Crash has taken it in a new direction with misplaced depth that can't be applied to the main game. Definitely worth a look if you've got friends willing to mix it up with you consistently, but solo gamers will quickly have their custom Scoot Vehicles all dressed up with nowhere to go.", "date": "Nov 4, 2002"}
