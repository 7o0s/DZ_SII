When unabashed destruction of mankind is implied, usually good times are quick to follow. And in some respects, THQ Wireless' Destroy All Humans! delivers some basic thrills involving an alien attack on 1950s America. There's human abduction. Merciless flash bag slaughter. UFO strafing runs. Cow-napping, man!   However, there are a couple design choices that hold Destroy All Humans! from galactic greatness. Based on the upcoming Xbox and PlayStation 2 game from Pandemic Studios, you slip into the gray skin of Crypto -- a member of a masochistic race of alien beings called Furons. The Earth was once seeded with Furon DNA, and now you need to return to the scene to make a withdrawal. Death and destruction mixed with ample abduction missions are of the essence in Destroy All Humans!   One of the problems with Destroy All Humans! is that some the missions sound more fun than they are to play. For example, one of the UFO missions directs you to abduct ten cows for processing. Sounds cool -- but you have no control over the actual UFO. It's on auto-pilot. You control a cursor. You must zap pesky humans repeatedly as well as tractor beam cows into your hull. These UFO missions plod along so slowly that when you meet the objectives and realize you still have to creep to the end of the mission, you'll let out an audible sigh.   Better are the on-foot missions. These missions share similar goals -- eliminate humans, abduct humans, escape alive. Crypto has a variety of weapons he can use on the human populace, such as a hypno-beam that can mind-melt up to three humans at a time. They will then follow him back to his ship for processing. Crypto's laser gun chars human flesh with great ease when you hold down the action button. There is a one-shot-kill antimatter gun that is useful against tough human agents and electric weapons really juice the scenery. Fortunately, your weapons have a bit of an auto-fire function so if you are facing the general direction of a target and they are within an invisible cone of sight (which seems to fluctuate in size), you can usually squeeze off a direct hit.   Your alien presence causes panic, so expect the majority humans (those prior to being destroyed) run around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Police officers sometimes get in close enough to pop off a shot, but they retreat with relative little warning. Government agents dressed in black steadfastly hold their ground and fire more powerful weapons at you. Enemy aliens are also quite pesky and have much bigger firepower than the humans. When too many humans notice you and the actions tarts getting frantic, use can engage the HoloBob and temporarily disguise yourself to look like a regular human for a while. As soon as you use a weapon, though, you revert back to Crypto form.   But even these on-foot missions get a little repetitive. It doesn't help that a lot of the real estate looks the same. Yes, this is a small 1950s Americana small town, but all of the cows are Holstein? All of the houses have perfect white picket fences? Every human wears the same frumpy suit? Yes, this is supposed to be something of a send-up of this unique time in post-war America and yes, cell games have limited space -- but there are a good deal of other games that offer up more variety.   Destroy All Humans! is also connected to the Xbox edition of the game. The in-game menus in the Xbox game have a ~wireless~ section that previews the game and shows you how to not only download the game, but gives you short codes for downloading wallpapers and sound files. That's pretty damn slick and the ringtones we've heard are clever. THQ Wireless was able to get the original voices from the console game to record original dialogue that will appeal to fans of the game. However, the person in line in front of you at the post office will wonder what the hell is going on in your pocket.  Destroy All Humans! is something of a disappointment. The game is full of great promise. The concept certainly is a winner -- but some of the play mechanics really un-do the potential charm. The UFO sequences are painfully slow and the on-foot missions get a little repetitive after a while. Fans of the console game will get the most out of the mobile Destroy All Humans!, but if you're just looking for a good little actioner, you may want to miss this invasion.", "date": "May 14, 2005"}
