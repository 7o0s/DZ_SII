This time, the developer/publisher is cooling things off with FOX Sports Hockey '04. Problem is, we're cooling off on the game play style ourselves.   Features:  Hockey-rink sound effects  Boxing-style fights  Try to out-maneuver your opponents   FOX Sports Hockey '04 follows a familiar game formula that Sorrent has been using with many of their FOX Sports, like Football and Basketball. Instead of physically moving the puck down the rink like a traditional console game, you see things from a first-person view. To pass the puck, tap the corresponding numbers over the heads of the other skaters. Do this until you reach the goal, then try to slap it in.   A year ago, when we first reviewed FOX Sports Football, we were impressed that Sorrent was able to craft a clever little system like this to approximate the sport. Problem is, mobile games has evolved as of late, and FOX Sports Hockey '04 seems behind the curve now. After playing games like Tecmo Bowl, it's hard to get hyped about pressing number pad buttons.   Fortunately, Sorrent does break up the monotony by injecting the trademark fights that hockey is known for. These action sequences, when occasionally occur between possessions, require the player to start jamming on action buttons to swing their fists. These fights are the best part of the game.   Another interesting addition is a power-up system -- should you make successful passes to each of your three skaters, your slap shot is juiced up for an instant goal. This will inspire gamers to keep trying new strategies of moving the puck down the ice, instead of repeatedly going for the same skaters.   FOX Sports Hockey '04 certainly has that clean, Sorrent look. There is a distinct level of polish on most Sorrent games, and this certainly includes hockey. The player models look pretty good, especially the goalies and the fighter in the side-view ~boxing~ matches. Also, the game sounds accurate, from the opening jingle to the extra noises you will hear on the ice, like sirens and airhorns.  FOX Sports Hockey '04 is by no means a bad game, it's just that this particular formula seems to be wearing thin. Cellphones are capable of more, as we've begun to witness in other games, and it's time for Sorrent to retire this style and advance the ball, so to speak. If you are a hockey fan, by all means, consider FOX Sports Hockey '04 -- it is what it is, and that's probably good enough.", "date": "Apr 6, 2004"}
