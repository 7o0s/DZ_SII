Electronic Arts' mythical take on chess, where a board full of whimsical monsters literally battles it out for each square, is a classic -- but for some reason, EA hasn't done anything with the cherished franchise. So Mforma and Pico Mobile did. Except they called it Maelstrom.  Features  Magical chess-like game Fight as mythical beasts and magicians  Maelstrom is a fairly simple game, which is very much to its benefit. Two sides sit across from each other on a chess-like board. Every character has it's own limited range of movement. Strategically take squares on the board, and when another character occupies a space you want/need, you duke it out in a short action sequence.  The action sequences take place in different kinds of terrain. Forests, rocky regions, and desert are a few of the territories in dispute. Weather effects also come into play. Should you challenge a flying beast for a space currently drenched by a torrential downpour, you will be at an immediate advantage, as wet wings slows down your opponent.  There are three types of attack during the action sequences: projection, aura, and sword. While the game may look like a basic hack n slash affair, there is an issue with ~reloading~ that must always be kept in mind. Swords are quick to cut, but they lack the ~oomph~ of magical aura attacks.  Once you win the square, or lose it, it's back to the board screen. From here, plot your next movie, but take a moment to scroll over enemy characters and check their strength and health. Fortunately, if your characters have been wounded in battle, you can use your wizard to heal them between battles. Wizards can also resurrect fallen characters, imprison foes so they cannot move, and cast a ~berserk~ spell on two enemy pieces so they fight each other to the death.  The goal is to take control of the four corners of the board -- the Dragon Towers. Easier said than done, and most games will be won or lost simply by eliminating the opposing army rather than nabbing the towers.  Controlling your army on the board is rather easy. During the action sequences -- not so easy. It feels a little clunky and sluggish, even with winged characters that are supposed to be fast. And fighting with a sword is such a crap shoot. It's hard to tell if you have your blade lined up or if you're really close enough to make contact. Archon never had those problems, guys, and that was running on a crappy C64.  Maelstrom does look fairly decent. We tried it on a Samsung N400 and the colors were crisp. The text was easy to read. The little character icons are well-done -- every beast looks decidedly different. There's nothing worse than mistaking your imp for a wizard when you got a demon breathing down your neck, am I right? Huh? You're silence is deafening, as is the silence in the game. I have a very, very strong affinity for Archon, so I went into Maelstrom with a decent set of high hopes. Unfortunately, control issues manage to derail most of the game's promise. While it was certainly cool to see that Pico put some serious thought into designing the characters and giving them different strengths and weakness to be exploited, combat was just too muddled to enjoy the game.", "date": "Jan 16, 2004"}
