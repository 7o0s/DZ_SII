After slogging through a few rounds of boring to straight-up bad software, the N-Gage is now hosting the kind of games that could have made it a success in the first place. Its latest racer, the sci-fi themed System Rush is one of the better games the system has ever seen. Everything from the setting to the control to the sense of speed comes together to deliver a satisfying experience that any fan of F-Zero would enjoy.   The overall look of the game is immediately striking. System Rush takes major cues from Disney's ~TRON,~ complete with glistening racer models and neon-edged landscapes that look like scrapped designs found in Flynn's stash of notes. The explanation for the look is passable: You are a hacker, skimming the networks of global corporations for code. Depending on what network you are racing, you'll see scenery appropo for the server's physical location. The Russian track is decorated with red stars while the American track even features the Statue of Liberty. The other racers on the scene are either security drones or rival hackers. Their vehicles feature the same vector-licious sheen as yours.   Fortunately, System Rush is hardly all flash. There is a meaty racing game beneath the glow, with dozens of racing events across a total of fifteen tracks. And thanks to the vertical orientation of the N-Gage's screen, the action keeps fairly busy. With narrow corridors, things can get a little rough when creeping up on another rig in the machine. However, if things get a little too hairy, you can seek out a ramp or jump and deploy a set of wings. Gliding helps you leapfrog other vehicles or avoid track hazards.   As with most racers in this category, the track offers up power-ups and boost pads. Bonuses restore lost energy to keep you in the race, enable a temporary shield (called a firewall, thanks to the whole hacking motif), and cleave speed from the other racers. You can also upgrade your hackermobile between races with earned points.   The point system, and vehicle upgrades betrays one small problem with System Rush -- it's a little on the easy side. After you juice your ride, winning races isn't that difficult. As you near the end of the story, the other vehicles do get aggressive, but that challenge is countered with your own smashing vehicle.   System Rush is stocked with game modes. The basic single-player campaign tracks the exploits of your hacker in the system. After you unlock a new course, it can be replayed in Free Hack and GP mode. System Rush supports both Bluetooth for multiplayer head-to-head racing or the sharing of shadows. Hack TV lets players get a peek at shows via Arena. It's a surprising amount of content for an N-Gage game, and it helps explain why the game stayed in the hopper for so long.  System Rush manages to engage the player with not only a healthy amount of tracks and challenges, but also solid controls and a good sense of speed. There may even be times when you feel like the game is going too fast. But it's not just the amount of content that impresses, but the quality. The look and sound of the game is fab -- what self-respecting gamer doesn't love an homage to ~TRON?~ -- and the tracks are worth racing on. If you still have an N-Gage, System Rush is something to keep it in your hands for more than gabbing.", "date": "Nov 22, 2005"}
