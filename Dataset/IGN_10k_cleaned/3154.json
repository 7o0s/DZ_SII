{"name": "Gex", "name_review": "Gex", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/gex", "text": "Gex is one of those side-scrolling platformers that never really made it big (Rayman is another that comes to mind). Originally released for the 3DO, Gex contains all the elements of the classic 16-bit platformer, and throws a few extra surprises in for good measure.  This is exactly the same as the 3DO version, with no real improvements or changes, but it does have some interesting features. Thanks to his suction cups, Gex can stick to most surfaces, which enables him to do a lot of neat tricks which puts a clever spin on the traditional platform game. Plus Gex is voiced by genuinely funny comedian Dana Gould, which makes the whole exercise pretty painless. Usually, wise-cracking voice overs suck, but here it really does work.  Each of the game's five areas are based around a specific movie theme (horror, science fiction, etc.) and are pretty unique. Plus there's loads of bonus levels to find. Sure, it's starting to look a little dated but a good side-scroller never hurt anyone.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
