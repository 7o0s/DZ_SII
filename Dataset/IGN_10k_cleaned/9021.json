There was a time when Sonic was a wholly reliable mascot, consistently fun, always dependable. But recent years have seen none of that reliability, as game after game with the Hedgehog's name have come along and tarnished any positive reputation he may have ever had. We've suffered through Shadow and his worthless guns, an attempt to take away his natural speed and replace it with hoverboard riding, and even the woeful ~franchise reboot~ that failed to live up to anyone's expectations. It's just a pain to put any faith at all in any new Sonic product that's announced or developed any more, as you'll just be setting yourself up for disappointment. Why can't we just revisit the days when Sonic meant quality, and fun, and running really fast to the right side of the screen?   Well, we can. Put aside any sideways focus on today's Sonic misfires and use the Virtual Console to experience yesteryear's surefire hits  including, now, Sonic the Hedgehog 3. In sharp contrast to the Sonic we know today, whose games seem to be getting consistently worse and worse over time, the opposite was true in the Genesis era. The first Sonic game established a solid, satisfying, super-speedy experience. The second refined the formula, and added even more to the mix. And the third title, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, completed the trilogy as the best of them all.   Sonic 3 finds our hero and his sidekick Tails landing on the mystical Angel Island, where Dr. Robotnik is once again up to no good. But the Doc isn't the first foe to get in Sonic's face  this time it's the red echidna Knuckles, introduced in this game's opening sequence for the very first time. Knuckles knocks Sonic for a loop, steals his stash of Chaos Emeralds, and quickly runs away. Sonic and Tails' quest to chase Knuckles down, and foil Dr. Robotnik's latest plot along the way, is the central focus of this adventure.   And it's a focus that stays in focus, as Sonic 3 uses cutscenes and interstitial appearances by Knuckles throughout the game. The enhanced sense of solid transition is an upgrade here over previous Sonic titles  rather than just fading to black after each stage is completed, the action just keeps going. Every area is connected to the last, and that makes things feel much more cohesive.     You'll want to fully explore each of these interconnected stages in turn, and some enhancements to the basic Sonic gameplay facilitate just that. Sonic has new access to some enhanced jumping techniques when he's equipped with shields this time around, and Tails can finally fly under his own power. Players adventuring alone can control either character, or two players can join in together and simultaneously run and jump through each level. Tails can even pick up Sonic and give him a helicopter boost in that mode.   Further multiplayer options are available through the Competition menu, which splits the screen horizontally just like Sonic 2 and gives you the choice to face a friend in head-to-head racing, or to challenge the clock in Time Trial mode.  And the 3D bonus rounds Sonic 2 introduced seem to have inspired a similar side-game here, as well, as collecting Chaos Emeralds during the adventure takes place on a three-dimensional, rotating plane populated by blue orbs. Touch all the orbs without hitting a red one to win an Emerald  get all seven to unlock a better ending at the adventure's end.   All of these features are over and above the standard Sonic the Hedgehog gameplay, which is fast and frantic platforming/running action, as before. But the considerable praise lavished on Sonic 3 can't come without some criticism, and that falls to this title's interaction with the next game in the series, Sonic & Knuckles.   Sonic & Knuckles came out on the Genesis in the same year as Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and its content was originally meant to be a part of the third game. S&K shipped as a lock-on cartridge, so players could snap their Sonic 3 carts into the top of it and access the excised levels and features  how this same functionality could be recreated on the Virtual Console, which has no physical media to work with, is a question that's still up in the air. It's possible that a software solution could recognize if you have downloaded both Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles in the future, and give you access to the Sonic 3 & Knuckles content, but that's really just speculation. You may end up being left with just half a game in both cases.Sonic 1 we called impressive. Sonic 2 we labeled great. Sonic 3, though, is the best of them all  and deservingly earns the highest score of the trilogy. But we recognize that the issue of its connection to the so-far-unreleased Sonic & Knuckles is a point of contention, and it may make even serious fans want to wait a while before investing 800 Wii Points here. If that's you, we understand. But we're going to give Sonic the benefit of the doubt this time and stand by the quality of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, even as a standalone game. Because compared to the trash he's been involved in lately, just Sonic 3 alone is pure gaming gold.", "date": "Sep 12, 2007"}
