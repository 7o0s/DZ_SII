The title gained notoriety during its development mainly due to the fact that it was one of the original ~Xbox Exclusive~ games to be announced, especially after originally being revealed as a multi-console product. But it's no longer an exclusive because of THQ's publishing agreement with Microsoft that gives THQ the opportunity to produce Game Boy Advance editions of key Microsoft products. But whatever charm the impressive-but-dull Xbox adventure had has been nearly completely lost in the translation to handheld; the portable version of Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee fails to impress like the console version did, but more importantly it just isn't much fun to play. Features Two playable character More than ten different missions Password save Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is entirely based upon the situations that unfold in the Xbox game, which is, essentially a continuation of Oddworld: Abe's Exodus, a sequel to Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. The story's a little on the confusing side for those not familiar with the Oddworld story, but all you really need to know is this: Abe is considered a ~savior~ to his people thanks to his actions in the past two Oddworld games. He's hooked up with a gabbit creature named Munch who's escaped from the clutches of the evil corporate Glukkons, and this team of Abe and Munch are now destined to stop the Glukkons' evil plans of enslaving Abe's race and using the gabbits for their own plans.  The Game Boy Advance version's gameplay is mission based, and requires players to initially alternate control over both Abe and Munch in order for players to learn the differences in abilities between the two characters, but once the game begins players will swap between the two as the puzzles require them to work together. Abe can tell his own kind to follow him, stay put, ask them to assist in chanting or attack when necessary, or pick these guys up and chuck 'em into places they normally wouldn't go. He can also sneak around quietly or run around in the top-down environment, as well as leap up or across different platforms. Most importantly, using energy he can ~possess~ any enemy and take control of them, which comes in handy when there are things in the area that would normally do Abe some harm. Water isn't his forte, though, and that's where Munch comes in. This guy is a lot slower than Abe but he can swim like an otter...but he can also take control of cute, imprisoned Fuzzles that can attack enemies like Pikmin; the more Munch has backing him up, the more aggressive an attack since they swarm enemies like ants.  You honestly don't have to play through the first couple of games on the PlayStation to understand Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. In fact, that's something completely discouraged since the precursor Oddworld games are far superior than this game. Japanese GBA development house Art Co., fresh off their past mediocre GBA versions of Space Channel 5 and Disney's Princess, worked to recreate the gaming experience of Munch's Oddysee's 3D platform-ish puzzle design. The team is obviously not the cleanest or most efficient handheld studio out there as the game, while attempting to be what the Xbox game was, is clunky in control and murky in graphics, and features a ton of glitches that hinder the enjoyment. Abe's movements are jerky and sporatic especially when changing direction or jumping platforms, and trying to pick up his friends is an exercise in frustration due to terrible collision detection. Munch moves rediculously slow on land, even if it is a design issue done on purpose; it's just not very fun to take control over this guy when it comes to moving out of water, which is something that's required in several puzzle designs. And when some puzzles require players to move both characters throughout a level that spans multiple rooms and huge scrolling areas, the game just becomes a chore. And things that are intended to be fun aren't supposed to be thought of as ~a chore.~  The Oddworld games have always been known for their attention to sound as well as their amazing graphic style. This GBA game, however, doesn't look very good at all. Though the character animation's based upon the models used in the Xbox game, they're extremely low color and lack detail in their movements. The backgrounds are incredibly dithered as well, even though the 3D perspective is easier to see than, say, Banjo-Kazooie, it's more due to the fact that there's very little coloring going on in the tiles. The sound is a mixed bag; the developers lifted a lot of the cute vocal effects from the Xbox design, but the ambient background audio is anything but subtle when it continuously glitches out when moving from screen to screen, or standing in a place that the engine just doesn't like. The attempt to recreate the Xbox's 3D game design on the Game Boy Advance is certainly ambitious, but in all honesty the developers should have just stuck with the tried-and-true 2D Prince of Persia-style of the previous Oddworld games for this conversion. Munch's Oddysee is full of little quirks that add up to a very un-fun GBA  game that can't even fall back on technical merits.", "date": "Sep 29, 2003"}
