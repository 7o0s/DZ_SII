But unlike the awful Disney Sports Skateboarding and the barely-average Disney Sports Football, Disney Sports Basketball is far more desirable as a action sports game because it's obvious that a proper handheld development team paid proper respect to its game with an in-depth design.  What's more, this game fills an empty niche on the Game Boy Advance; the only other basketball game released on the system is the absolutely garbage NBA Jam 2002 released by Acclaim last year. Disney Sports Basketball is a way, way better game...even if you're playing as cartoon heroes instead of NBA pros. Features: Seven playable characters More than 25 different power-ups Cartridge save (three slots) GameCube connectivity Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Disney Sports Basketball pays a little tribute to the classic NBA Jam game design, but it's only similar in that it's a two-on-two design with monster dunks and limited fouls. The designers brought a bit more originality and technique to the genre -- Disney Sports Basketball features a lot more basketball-esque control in its arcade-style design. On defense, it's the standard ball-stealing and shot-blocking, but on offense, players will have to learn the little nuances, like backing into defensemen or pulling off crossover dribbles to scurry past a defender. Because the game features a few more techniques than the standard arcade basketball design, the developers threw in a very, very handy tutorial mode with each of the individual moves highlighted for easy reference. The controls are very tight, though even with the tutorial mode these controls are a little on the clumsy side; the ~steal~ button is also used as the ~block~ button, so it's a bit tricky to time a shot on defense because if you're too early your character will simply swipe at the ball instead of jump for it.  There's a great sense of discovery in Disney Sports Basketball, since the game design also focuses on collecting and utilizing different power-ups. As players successfully move through the game's Challenge modes, they'll earn different icons that can then be used during a match; each character in the two-on-two match-up can have one of these power-ups, which can be activated via specific criteria. For example, one power-up will give a character the ability to always score a basket if he launches the ball during the period buzzer, which is a great way to score four points...but only if you can get the ball in time. Some power-ups give characters the ability to shoot the ball more accurately, or attack players with a furious move, or pull off super high layups that are nearly impossible to block. But these require a full power bar at the bottom of the screen, bars that slowly fill as the game advances; it's up to the player to use their power-ups at the best moments in the match. There are as many as 25 of these power-ups to earn and collect, and what's more, these can be traded between GBA or GameCube systems using a link cable.  Though there are several different Disney characters to choose from, and each of these characters have their own strengths and weaknesses, successfully winning games will earn these characters power points which can then be used to upgrade their attributes. Each attribute requires a set amount of points in speed, power, technique, and attitude, and how you play the game determines how many points you earn in each of these slots. Mixing up playing styles is encouraged to earn a ton of attribute points. And the game isn't just a two-on-two design. The developers also included a nice list of mini-games to give the package a bit more variety. And they work pretty well, especially the very challenging, fast-paced three-point contest. The freethrow challenge is also a tricky lot, since players have to use the L and R button to line up two powerbars with a constantly rising and falling line to get the ball into the basket. Timing is everything.  The graphics keep with the existing Disney Sports style, with 3D, pre-rendered sprites for all the characters in the game. But unlike the chunky animation that's found in Skateboarding and Football, the character motions in Basketball are much smoother and pleasing to the eye. And the line-shifting courts have a really nice reflection effect going on, giving the game that extra layer of polish. The sound, beyond the energetic Disney Sports theme song used in the other Disney Sports games, doesn't fair as well, since the game uses the weak Game Boy Color chip for its background tunes. After playing the previous Disney Sports games in Konami's library, I didn't expect much out of this basketball game. But I am surprised at how much better this game is over the Football and Skateboarding titles released around the same time. Just goes to show the differences a development team can make. This two-on-two basketball game has a couple of control quirks in its design (pairing up the ~steal~ and ~jump block~ commands on one button was a bad choice), but these can be overcome. Beyond that, it's an excellent challenge with a lot of variety in its design. Disney Sports Basketball is still no true substitute for a spot-on conversion of the classic Midway arcade basketball design...but until that happens, this game will fit the bill nicely.", "date": "Jan 28, 2003"}
