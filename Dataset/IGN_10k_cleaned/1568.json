{"name": "The Mummy", "name_review": "The Mummy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/01/the-mummy-4", "text": "The movie The Mummy is one of those conspicuously produced movies for the ~summer viewer.~ It's filled with bubble-gum adventure, light-hearted jokes, scary scenes, and a little love interest to tie it all up in a bow. It's the classic stuff of Hollywood. Although I wasn't too fond of the movie, I truly enjoy adventure games, and though I shouldn't admit it, a little part of me was looking forward to the game of the same name.   The Mummy, however, disappoints in all of the most obvious ways. And while some little hints of neat production values and smooth movie tie-ins were worked on, this light-hearted action-adventure game suffers from so many little problems that it eventually is a chore, not a delight to play. It's games like The Mummy that make the fifth iteration of Tomb Raider: Chronicles look so damn playable. And that can't be good.   Gameplay Players get the chance to take on the role of Rick O'Connell, a foreign legionnaire who, in the awkward likeness of Brendan Fraser, travels back to Hamanaptra with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan and her adventurous but greedy brother, Jonathan. I'll skip the whole story since it was indeed the same as the movie, and it's in the manual, too, and if you didn't read that you get the whole intro sequence from the feeble in-game cut-scene intro. The gist of it is this: Evelyn reads a passage from the Ancient Book of the Dead and awakens Imhotep. You start by venturing inside Hamanaptra, the Lost City of the Dead, with Evelyn and Thomas, and it's your task to put him, er, back to sleep.   The Mummy is, at its heart, an arcade-style action game with adventure elements. Not the other way around. The game provides you with sense of discovery but it's couched in an action formula, not a wide open, discovery way, so while initially The Mummy seems like Tomb Raider, it's not. It's simple. What happens in The Mummy is that almost everything you need to find is right around you, whether on a ledge nearby, behind a wall that a switch opens, or pretty much in any easy-to-find area. The sense of discovery is made easy and it happens frequently. Again, it's an arcade game.   At least one sense of discovery will knock you over the head, however. And that's how often a group of enemies will swarm in on you and pummel you on the head. I found that nine out of 10 times I had just enough or not enough ammo or weaponry to fight off diggers, mummies, zombie workers, and the like. I guess that's where block move comes in. The block function helps when you're fighting an enemy in front of you, not behind. Oh...well, scratch that note, because they lways sneak up from behind you. Seriously, though, the hack-and-hack-some-more mentality of The Mummy, while paralleling the movie, quickly grows repetitive and uninteresting. If there was more time dedicated to smoothing out the 3D engine and the interactions between Rick and his enemimes, the game would have had a little more life to it. This game simply won't drive your imagination very far at all.   The Mummy is packed with bad guys to fight, and oddly enough (or not), it stole Tomb Raider's (or was it Zelda's?) auto-aiming function, and uses several techniques and ideas from other games as well. The Mummy enables players to light torches and use as them as weapons but also to light passageways, in addition to handling two-fisted pistol attacks. Players also can hang from walls and move left or right while doing so. Essentially, you've got a relatively fast-moving Tomb Raider here, but again, with more focus on simple redundant action, and almost no real exploration, you'll grow tired of it quickly.   What kills the game in the end is its overall look, feel, and overall polish, which doesn't leave much else. (You already know the ending, right?) You're given a decent set of actions, including walk, run, strafe-roll, attack, jump, leap, quick 180 turn, block, and look around, and you'll need them all. But while the character moves are functional, they're coated like syrup with a poor framerate, chunky, sluggish animations, and some super dorky looking character models. Any work that was done to make this game look good is for naught. When you get a look at the Brendan Fraser's face, you'll see what I mean. It looks like less than 150 polygons were used for his whole character model, and his face looks like one giant, flat, jaggy-edged block, with a texture map stretched across it, like a streched-out Silly Putty picture. The result is that his face looks more like a mangled Lego character head, than anything that resembles a human.   But if it's enemies you want to shoot and hack away at, you should be happy with The Mummy. You won't be short on enemies to kill, or weapons and power-ups to find, because there is quite a lot to acquire. every 10 to 20 steps you'll be fighting or picking stuff up. It's an absolute treasure chest for hyperactive, Ritilin-induced kids.   In the end, while the boss fights aren't are too bad and the weird tomb surfing is a neat idea, The Mummy is a forced, unpolished, simplistic game that makes us confront the whole Tomb Raider concept once again, only this time worse. If it's an adventure game you want, I recommend the first, fourth, or even the fifth Tomb Raider, or Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, which is vampiric fun, and even the lowly, comic Xena Princess Warrior is superior to this.   Graphics OK, so it's been made clear that graphically, The Mummy is not a piece of art on the high end, and that it's close damn bad on the low end. But there is one thing that I really did like about the game's looks: The Egyptian textures were fantastic. I'm no Egyptologist, but I felt like I was in a huge underground tomb in Egypt and the hieroglyphics and overall design of the levels was very impressive. I like it. The pictures that lit up, the colorful paintings, and the general color palette was excellent. Nicely done.   As for the other aspects of the visuals, the game has its little ups and its big downs. The front end of the game is slick. When you scroll down on the initial game menu, the unnerving hieroglyphics transform into readable words, like Start Game, Options, etc. Also, for those who like relatively low resolution movies, The Mummy has a surprise in it! A preview trailer for the sequel to the movie is in the first menu you see. It's kind of cool, too. That's a first. So, yeah, if you buy The Mummy, you'll see the preview of The Mummy Returns.   But again, it's hard not bring up the game's nagging demons. The choppy animation, the horrible, inhuman faces on the clunky, awkward character models and the miserable framerate bring the whole game crashing down in a pit of mediocre mummy stew. A good witch's brew might be a little tastier than this meatless Mummy loaf.   Sound The high point of The Mummy is its compelling music. Straight from the movie, the dramatic movie score is simply awesome. It changes depending on the situation and it is nerve-racking and builds momentum and increases tension in all of the right places. I can't say that I like the game much, but man, if more games could dish out the sweet sounds that The Mummy does, I would be a happy sweet-song fool. Also, it should be noted that while these don't sound like the original actors' voices, but they're close enough to fit the bill. Plus, the less Brandon Fraser says the better, right? Meanwhile the trite, one-liners are cut down to a minimum and when the characters do speak, they're either helpful or funny. I have this little part of me that wants to really like The Mummy. I'm pretty sure it's the little kid inside of me that just loves games no matter what phenomenal problems the game has. I can't help it, but I do like parts of the mummy, and yet I very difficult time recommending it to anyone. It's really a simple action game all dressed up in a clunky 3D outfit, but parts of it are almost fun. There are a good amount of weapons to pick up and use, there are tons of artifacts and power-ups, and it's got all of the trappings of a good adventure, just none of the imagination, good gameplay, or polish. It's too bad, because if any movie was made to be a potentially good videogame, it's The Mummy.", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
