After the awful 2D edition of Madden NFL 07 that looked and played nothing like something EA Mobile (or JAMDAT) would put their name on, it's good to get back in the groove of what mobile football should be. Solid 3D graphics, smart presentation, and familiar controls make Madden NFL 07 3D a pleaser for armchair quarterbacks.   Tested on an LG VX8100 (the workhouse VCAST handset on Verizon Wireless), Madden NFL 07 3D benefits from solid EA-style presentation. The front-end is smart and clean, goosed by a personalization tool that dresses it up according to your favorite NFL team. All of the options you'd want from a mobile Madden are front and center, from season mode to a quick play that drops you right into an exhibition game. Madden employs a full NFL license, so you have every single real world team and player in the game.   The in-game visuals deserve mentioning up front. Madden NFL 07 3D is a big step up from last year's muddy mess of polygons. The player models are good-sized, constructed of enough polygons to reasonably approximate a league player. The players are all the same size, though -- it's still too early in the game to expect different models. (Although, it does use different skin tones.) EA Mobile claims that players feature motion captured animations, and I'd apt to believe it after playing the game for some time. After completing certain plays, you're treated to ~cut scene~ cinemas that show players move and react to the action. Also nice: The field is textured to look like actual grass with numbers painted right on the green, unlike the ugly, flat 2D edition.   Being Madden, Madden NFL 07 3D features layered audio with commentary from the big guy himself, as well as Al Michaels. The speech is clear and easy to understand, but Madden's clips are on a quick rotation. You will hear the same clips over and over if you play more than a few games. The audio also includes crowd noise and the crunch of pad against pad when players collide.   But how does it play? Madden NFL 07 3D takes a lot of cues from JAMDAT's final NFL game -- and it's a better game for it. The color coded tags that reveal the ~open~ status of a player are the most useful tools in the entire game. On offensive, you can use the tags to discern who to pass the ball to. A player with a green tag is open, but that can turn red in an instant, signaling that the pass will be incomplete -- and maybe even intercepted. The ball is even color coded, so when it's green, you can count on a good catch.   The color coding is also used in running and tackling. When carrying the ball down field, use the tag color to plan your course of action. When you're green, you're safe to keep charging ahead -- but when you turn yellow or red, look out for incoming tackles. When on defense, use the color tags to decide when to initiate a tackle. When the ball carrier is green, you'll miss. But when he's red, dive into him to stop the ball.   The game uses familiar controls for mobile football. When passing, you throw the ball to players by pressing the number key assigned to potential receivers. If you are intimately familiar with your handset, you'll find this system fairly easy to use. But if you need time to get the feel of the game flow, there is an auto-mode that runs the play until you step in. This is effectively cheating, because the AI is strong, so don't rely on it if you want to win some honest games. Kicking is handled through a series of meters, as you've undoubtedly seen in most mobile sports titles.   The colorful, helpful playbook helps mobile quarterbacks pick the best plays for the right situations. The playbook features play taken right out of Madden's personal files. I wish the game offered recommended plays, but the playbook is detailed enough that even novices will get the swing of things after a few games.   Madden NFL 07 3D is tripped up mainly when the on-screen action bunches up. When playing defense, it can prove tough to see everything in the mass of polygons that converge on the ball carrier. That's a problem with trying to serve up full 11-on-11 football on the smallest screen. Until screens are larger, it's unavoidable, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The color coding helps a little, but it's still irksome when you see a ball carrier slip through the middle of a cluster.  Madden NFL 07 3D is a far superior product over the 2D edition -- it's the only download you should consider if you want at some mobile Madden. The presentation is excellent thanks to detailed players, colorful fields, a smart playbook interface, and some good (if not too frequently recycled) audio. Defense is still not as fun to play as offense, thanks to the problem of seeing players bunch together in the middle of a small screen, but the color coding -- the game's best feature -- is a big help. After a middling performance last year, Madden NFL 07 3D rebounds by cribbing some of the JAMDAT magic. A worthy download.", "date": "Sep 6, 2006"}
