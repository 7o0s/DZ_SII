Not only was a terrific action movie, but it tackled domestic issues, offered a real sense of fear and endangerment, and dared broach the possibility that we aren't exactly all created equal potential and that mediocrity shouldn't necessarily be rewarded so everybody can enjoy a warm fuzzy. Heady stuff for an alleged kids movie -- that apparently came ~thisclose~ to a Best Picture nomination.   Well, the DVD is all set for release in just a few weeks, and Disney Mobile is wisely set to support said launch with a new mobile movie game based on the movie. But this time, thanks to increase tech, the plight of the Incredible family has gone 3D. Even though there have already been two previously released games based on the franchise -- including a clever platformer developed by the talents at Lavastorm Engineering -- this new edition is very, very worthy of your download dollars.   The Incredibles 3D zeroes in on a few action scenes from the movie and transforms them into multi-stage levels. You will visit the jungles of Syndrome's island as fat Bob to dismantle an Omnidroid. Help Dash escape from a system of tunnels. And finally, help Bob re-overcome another fine-tuned Omnidroid that's tearing up the city. All in a day's work for a family of superheroes.   He game will remind you of the classic Crash Bandicoot titles. Your character is always on the move, either running toward or away from the camera. You must constantly keep batting away obstacles or jump over them lest you fall too far behind. It's a simple gaming mechanic that, while it no longer works on consoles, is right at home on a handset. As Bob, you are smashing guards or jumping over fallen girders. Each hero has their super skills put to use, such as Dash' ability to run across water or Bob's outrageous strength.   The sequences where you run from the camera are the easy ones. It's when your character is running toward you that things start to get difficult. Not frustrating, just difficult. Challenging, if you will. You have far less reaction time to seeing an obstacles, so you better have one finger firmly hovering just above the ~action key~ so you aren't caught by a fence.   While zipping through the courses, keep one super-eye open for Incredipoints. These appears as the family crest, spinning over particularly tough obstacles or at the end of high jump opportunities. These bonus points offer a plethora of goodies, such as extra lives.   The Incredibles 3D looks like a million bucks -- wireless-wise. The use of color is something to marvel at -- these levels are so bright and pleasing to look at you'll want to watch the movie again after playing the game -- an excellent benchmark for success. The character models are not especially complex, they are constructed of just enough polygons to get the job done. But the texture work is superb, better than many of the 3D games we've played so far. The uniforms and faces are very recognizable, which is of utmost importance when playing such a character-driven game.   The levels are smartly decorated with trees, tunnel pods, and skyscrapers. With all of these happening on-screen, we were wondering when The Incredibles 3D would start to chug. Good news -- it never did. The game scaled along without pause or slowdown.  The Incredibles 3D is easily the best of the new 3D action titles I've played this year. It's an example of what 3D brings to the table when a developer sees it as a way to enhance gameplay mechanics, not just as a gimmick. The way the game is carved up into several bite-sized levels that last no longer than a few minutes is a good way to get a console-esque game smartly into the wireless space, where gaming sessions are not as long. And then there's the graphics. You're certainly not going to put away THQ's The Incredibles game for consoles in favor of this, but it's a handsome little title that moves at an impressive clip. If you have a handset that can handle The Incredibles 3D, make it your next download.", "date": "Feb 26, 2005"}
