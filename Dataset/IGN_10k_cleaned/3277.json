Tennis Arena does just that.  With over five different courts, Tennis Arena allows gamers to challenge fictional racket handlers in one of the most fast-paced sports on the planet -- tennis.  The graphics in this game we're suprisingly good. The stadiums looked nice and the polygonal players were well rendered. Speaking of the players, and not to run on a tangent, but when I went through the character select screen, I didn't find Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi. No, I found a guy in baggy jeans, a girl that looked like Cyndi Lauper, and a fat guy with gold chains -- c'mon, these arenn't tennis players, these are eighth grade drop outs.    Honestly, though, Tennis Arena is the NBA Jam of tennis games. It has tennis rackets, multiple serves and volleys, but it also has these super-fast shots and these really crazy power moves. My favorite is Chang's Super Ninja Shot forehand... you'll just have to see it.   The game itself plays pretty simple. Players hit a ball back and forth, well, it's tennis. But the control is rather shallow and unresponsive. It's mainly reacting to a serve or volley, while having no real control on where you want to hit it the ball. It's like 3-D Pong.  Tennis Arena is like an obscure SNK arcade game, it's cheap, it's fast, and it's fun. But I still wouldn't call it a tennis game.  Jay Boor", "date": "Apr 1, 1998"}
