Along with those gems, there are those games that fail to have any redeeming quality, and would actually be worth negative money in the bargain bin. Gravity Games Bike: Street. Vert. Dirt. is one of those games.   Gameplay  There's a saying that goes, ~This is so bad it's not even funny.~ This is one of those games that is so bad, it actually is funny. Well, at least when someone else is playing. Gravity Games Bike: Street. Vert. Dirt. attempts to rip off every good BMX game, but fails miserably. For starters, the game's control is about as responsive as a pet rock. I can't be positively sure whether the designers implemented joystick support or not. Although the controls are set up like many other BMX games, attempting to actually use these controls is where things first go horribly awry. Moving and turning about is practically an act of futility. Bikes will get stuck on the smallest bump in the level and sometimes intersect with geometry, causing you to crash. Getting the rider to stop can induce fits of rage, as they'll sometimes continue to slide forward like they're on ice, never mind the times when the brakes seem to just give out and your rider will refuse to stop at all.   The game's turning radius can is best compared to an ocean liner. Attempting to turn around in a tight area is nearly impossible, so venturing off into a more open section of the level is often necessary just to change direction. Timing jumps requires more luck than skill. Sometimes the rider will pop up immediately, and sometimes they'll ride forward for a few more feet before finally taking to the air.   Attempting to grind on anything is almost like flipping a coin. Sometimes your player will grind on rails or objects, and sometimes they'll just fall past them, or often even through them. What's odd about this is that sometimes your rider will be reasonably far from a rail, and pressing the grind button will cause your bike to get sucked over to it. Other times you may be directly over a rail, and pressing the grind button will just result in a thrown controller as the bike passes directly through the rail.   Performing tricks is only slightly easier than learning to do them in real life. Tricks cannot be buffered while launching from a ramp, so you must wait until your rider is fully airborne before attempting any tricks. While this doesn't sound too bad, the timing that this requires is completely frustrating since it's much more finicky than any other extreme sports game. Some of the trick timing doesn't make any sense either, as some harder tricks take a shorter time to complete than easier and supposedly quicker tricks.   The game includes manuals, although they're about as useful as a kick to the head. Although it's possible to do so in real life, Gravity Games Bike will not let you peddle while performing a manual, which makes getting from place to place while keeping your combo going almost impossible. The manual meter is also nonsensical and practically useless, as the full length of the meter is not always used. Sometimes your player may fall while the meter is close to the end, and sometimes they'll fall while it's still near the middle.   On the other end of the ludicrous spectrum is the grind meter. It's so ridiculously easy to balance that it's entirely possible to stall on the edge of a ramp for the entire three-minute run, or at least until it gets boring. Stalling on a rail or ramp is also far and away the easiest way to score points in the game. Hopping up onto a rail and then jumping twenty or so times will accelerate the score quickly enough that every other scoring method seems like a complete waste of time.   The repeated hopping on a rail works because the game doesn't penalize you for performing the same move dozens of times. The game also doesn't use multipliers, which makes using manuals even more useless. Performing multiple tricks in a combo will make holdable tricks, like grabs, accelerate in score faster, which is why hopping on a rail repeatedly and then balancing for a while works well. This accelerated scoring idea doesn't work well anywhere else besides stalling, since stringing together combos elsewhere is nearly impossible.   With the game including the word ~gravity~ in its title, one would assume that some measure of real world physics would be present. In fact, gravity is practically the only rule of physics that actually exists in this game at all, even as poorly as it's implemented. Players will fall through the level multiple times during runs, get stuck in the level geometry, crash into nothing, get stuck on pedestrians, and generally break the time-space continuum.   Something that is incredibly odd and confusing is that you'll sometimes spawn in completely random places after you crash. On some levels, this frequently causes your player to spawn in an area that hasn't been opened yet, or sometimes even inside of the level geometry, where you must then restart the level. Spawning inside of an unopened area also makes item collection goals annoying, since you have no way of getting back out to finish collecting stuff, and you must restart.   One of the only positive things about Gravity Games Bike is its level size. The levels are quite large, and luckily the game's draw distance is reasonably good. The levels are large enough that even with a three-minute run time, some of the collection goals can cause time to run a bit short.   But just like the old saying, it isn't the size of your levels that counts; it's how you use them. And once again, Gravity Games Bike fails in an astonishingly massive way. Most of the game's goals are incredibly easy, and often so stupid that your forehead will hurt from slapping it so much. There are the mandatory score goals, collecting letters to spell ~g-r-a-v-i-t-y~ and so on that are pretty much a staple of this genre. The score goals are done easily with the rail-hopping trick, so that quickly becomes a joke. The ~g-r-a-v-i-t-y~ letters are spread around the level in an almost last second manner.    The biggest jokes are the collection goals. One of the levels has you smash three computers, which sounds fine, until you learn that all three computers are right next to each other. The museum level has five swords that need to be found, and four of them are within about ten feet of each other and require no effort to grab. Most other collection goals are equally easy.   The levels are also sparsely decorated and the placement of lines is almost nonexistent. There are rails randomly placed that lead to nothing, and some rails that lead into a wall, forcing the end of a possible combo. Some areas have almost no way to transition to another, so roaming about the level in one continuous combo is out of the question.   The competition levels make absolutely no sense in how they score, but the computer bikers put up such low numbers that it's simple to win every competition. In one round, I scored around 120,000 points using the rail-hopping technique, with only one move used the entire round, and scored a ~70.9~ for the round. The next round I performed over 15 separate tricks multiple times, mixed grind and ramp tricks, and scored nearly 400,000 points. I was given a score of ~70.7,~ lower than my rail-hopping and singular move round. I never crashed in either round, so that wasn't an issue.   For those that like to torture their friends, there are a few multiplayer modes. Most of them are a complete waste of time, such as the Team Attack, where two players combine forces to score 100,000 points as fast as possible. Most every multiplayer mode is simply a slight twist on a high score competition, and gets boring quite fast. The only mode worth including is the High Scores mode, where players must score higher in four out of seven categories in order to win, such as longest grind, biggest air, etc. This mode might actually be fun in another game, where controls and gameplay were actually given some attention.   Graphics  Blind people are at an advantage here, as they won't be able to see just how bad this game's graphics can get. The player models are some of the worst in videogame history, and only slightly better than Football on the Atari 2600. The riders' knees are way too close to their feet, and everyone looks like they wear size 2 shoes. Hands are proportional to their feet, which is to say that they don't look like they could palm a golf ball. Everyone's shoulders are so disproportionate that regular clothing would never fit them, and their legs look like toothpicks below the knee.   If the player models weren't bad enough to look at while standing still, once they start moving things start getting uglier. Trick animations are terrible, but only get worse when you fail to land them. Bikes disappear as soon as anyone crashes, and the players flop and roll around in a spastic manner. They fail to react to the environment at all, and instead just convulse in a random fashion.   Textures don't help the horrible models or level design. Object textures don't match up properly, so ramps and whatnot completely stand out from their environment, instead of looking like they should be there. The artists likely forgot the hotkey to adjust texture placement in their level designer, as it's possible to see a misaligned texture from practically any viewpoint in the game.   The game's camera is so choppy and unpredictable that it's extraordinarily disorienting when first playing. Using ramps causes the camera to pop around as it follows the player, and the camera will often be facing the completely wrong direction when spawning after a crash. Occasionally it's impossible to tell where you've spawned at after a crash until you begin moving, and by that point you may have fallen off a ledge that you meant to have stayed on.   The podium stand at the end of the competitions is completely unfinished. Most competitions failed to draw any other contestants, except for a level or two where the third place contestant was drawn, but not the second. My rider's bike was missing every time, even though she was supposed to have leaned on it and then picked it up.   Sound  If you choose to purchase or rent this game, make a trip to your local craft or drug store and purchase a highlighter. Upon arriving home, use said highlighter on your remote's ~mute~ button. You're gonna need to find that button every time you fire this game up.   Riding over grates produces a sound similar to grating your nails over a chalkboard. Crashing with any of the female riders will cause them to make noises that sound either like they're sneezing or are enjoying an immense amount of pleasure. The rest of the sound effects are either as annoying or nonsensical as these.   The game includes some licensed music for its soundtrack, including Disturbed, Adema, Reveille and others. The licensed music isn't exactly bad, but it's all been heard before, and sounds exactly like every other average extreme sports game soundtrack.   Where things get even worse than thought possible is that the licensed music makes up only a small percentage of the total soundtrack. The rest of the tracks are written by complete unknowns, and it is some of the worst music in the history of mankind. If this music somehow gets played on airwaves and thusly makes it's way into space, our chances of making peaceful contact with extra-terrestrials has dropped through the floor, as this music will be considered an assault on anything that can hear, and our planet will be destroyed.  Gravity Games Bike: Street. Vert. Dirt. is easily one of the worst games I've ever played, and at one point I had E.T. for my Atari. The controls are so horrible that it's probably worth the time to learn mind control over your PlayStation 2 and attempt to play the game that way. As many times as the terrible controls cause you to crash into things, you would assume that the designers would spend more time on the crashes, which are some of the worst I've ever seen.This game is bad enough that there is practically nothing positive, or even better than absolutely terrible, to say about it. What's even worse is that things had to die in order to make this game. Trees were killed for its manual, and I don't know what goes into plastic, but hopefully it doesn't include cat heads or human bone marrow.", "date": "Oct 15, 2002"}
