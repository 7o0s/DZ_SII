I seriously can't understand why Hit Maker (the same team responsible for that outstanding party fest Virtua Tennis) dropped their hats into an unfinished arena. With such an admirably high level of quality associated with their tennis racket, I couldn't believe the lack of entertainment to be found in their newest offering, Virtua Athlete 2K.  With memories of such classics as Track & Field and Track & Field 2 buried deep within my psyche, expectations were high. Besides, with Hit Maker's first jaunt into the realm of sports such an overwhelming success, who wouldn't have thought that their Olympic dreams could be matched too? I mean honestly, if what they can do with one sport is a mark of their talents, then just imagine what would happen if they had seven to work with!  The answer unfortunately, was nothing.  Best described as an interactive movie about the Olympics, Virtua Athlete is as basic a game as you can get. Broken up into a series of mini-events that total an overall score to gain victory, your alter-ego is thrust into the more famous events of the Decathlon. The seven modes of play are just a bit on the skimpy side with your selection ranging from the high jump, long jump, hurdles, 100 meter dash, shot put, javelin throw, and a 1500 meter run. Possessing so few events when compared to similar games, the replay value is smaller than that Vern guy from Austin Powers. Other contests, like swimming, weightlifting, or even the arm wrestling match-up from Track & Field 2 would have been welcome additions.  The seven events we do have to work with are sorely disappointing. The Javelin throw and shot put are honestly the only events that are as fun to play as they are to watch. And as simple as they may be, there's a bit of a macho satisfaction in mastering the simple timing techniques you need to grab that far-off distance. The rest of the competition however, is a mixture of separate running events that are sadly aloft the balcony of the boredom hotel. Press the buttons back and forth in strange controller configurations until you can't press them anymore, and then do it all over again until you've completed all the games. Wow, exciting (that's sarcasm folks!)  Break it all down to the core, and you'll find that five of the seven events are really the same game with different visual dressings. Ho hum.  But at least that dressing is a pleasing one. Not denying that Hit Maker knows how to push those polygons on the Dreamcast, Virtua Athlete 2K can visually compete with the big boys. Vibrant, happy-looking colors and some realistic character models are marred only by a couple of iffy bitmap choices representing the crowd. And other than the occasional hiccup in the animation, the frame rate issues from the Japanese version of the disc have all but disappeared.  It's just too bad that the game play doesn't match their respective graphical accomplishment. Holding all the depth of an old Intellivsion title, Virtua Athlete 2K won't keep your interest for long. Sure you may run through all the events once or twice, but what's there left to do after that? Want to unlock those special secrets? Don't even bother, you aren't missing anything. Bonuses in the game come in the form ~interests~. Beat the other athletes enough times and you too can boast that you enjoy boxing more than wrestling in your character profile. That's it you say? Yep, that's it!  Even the athlete creation feature is lacking. Pick a country, an outfit, and your lamer than lame interests for your profile and that's it... you're done. Physical attributes and facial features can't be altered or changed one bit, and neither can height, weight, and for all intents and purposes your face. None of these people look like any human being that I know, they're not even close! The illusion of putting yourself in the game to race along side world class competitors has been pretty much shattered. In Virtua Athlete 2000 everybody's the same, and while that may sound great to human rights activists, it sucks for a video game! We want diversity damn it!  In the end, Virtua Athlete 2K gives me that serious wasteful vibe. If only there had been a wider selection of events, more involved interaction, and some form of entertainment that didn't involve turning the system off, we could have had at least an average game here. Alas, what we're left with isn't a ~Virtua~ disappointment, it's a real one.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Sep 14, 2000"}
