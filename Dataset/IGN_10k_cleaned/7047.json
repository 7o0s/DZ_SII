It'd be nice if the gamer could help the developers of this Nintendo DS title find design inspiration, because this game is just a bad Double Dragon clone, and any originality this game might have was poorly conceived before the pixels were even laid down on the dual-screen handheld.   The Nintendo DS game certainly does start out promising, with an introduction credits sequence -- complete with a digitized recording of the theme song -- that captures the over-the-top energy of the series. Once it hits the title menu, though, it's all downhill. The development team went cool and cryptic to get players into the game design, which might fit the maniacal flavor of the series but it's just confusing as hell to figure out where things begin. If you can manage to get through the crazy game selection interface and into the actual game, you're faced with one of the most sloppily designed Final Fight/Double Dragon brawlers for any system. It's a generic genre that's hard to get right, and The Genie and the Amp definitely doesn't get it right.   We'll give the developer props for attempting something new, control-wise, that somehow fits the theme of the show. See, Ami and Yumi are members of a J-Pop band; musicians, to be exact, and to attack enemies, players ~strum~ on an on-screen guitar to pull off different attacks. Four different strings, four different attacks, and you can even link together more powerful attacks by strumming on two or four strings as ~chords.~ It's an idea that probably looked great on paper, but in practiceit's just bad. Without tactile feedback, it's hard to know without glancing down on the bottom screen which string you're strumming on, or if you're actually strumming on a string at all. It's so bad that the developer offer the immediate option of simply using the A, B, X and Y buttons as the four strings instead.    But even having the option of using standard action buttons can't save this bad design. The combat system in The Genie and the Amp is incredibly floaty and unresponsive most of the time. Animations for attacks are very generic and hard to read, so it's difficult to know when the on-screen character has started or stopped attacking so you can string together your combo and earn more points. And while you're stuck in an extensive punch or kick animation, the enemy has free reign to get cheap on your character and hit you without any sort of defense. Collision detection is mushy, too - it just lacks that satisfaction when taking out an enemy. It's almost like the developers never played a Double Dragon or Final Fight clone. Or, at least, a good one.   Worst of all, though, is the fact that there are absolutely no checkpoints. Some levels take several minutes to get through, and if both characters get killed on the way through, it forces players all the way back to the beginning. I almost made a martyr out of my Nintendo DS after having to play through the ~training~ level of this game at least four times simply because the frustrating difficulty level, sloppy control, unfair enemy attacks, and ridiculously long level structure made it next to impossible to advance through to the next part of the game.   The only encouragement to keep playing is the inclusion of little elements like a crane game, sushi mini-challenge, and the ability to collect costumes and guitars for both characters. That's it. All of these tempting little treats aren't nearly enough to get me to wade through the awful gameplay, and I wouldn't dare want to buy two of these games just so I can have a friend enjoy the pain that is Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: The Genie and the Amp.  The game sounds good, looks okay, but plays terribly. Unless you're an absolute maniac for all things Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, you should just say ~bye bye~ to this rendition. Yes, that was a bad pun. A bad pun for an equally bad game.", "date": "Jul 6, 2006"}
