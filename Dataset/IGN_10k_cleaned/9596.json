It's not a new offensive or defensive set that will confuse and hamper the plans of opposing coaches.  It's not paying off referees in a Donaghy-like scandal to make calls for one particular team.  Nor is it sending cheerleaders in front of the visiting bench to distract players.  The secret weapon is the fans in the stands and the energy boost given to the home team, and it's one of the new adjustments made to College Hoops 2K8, the latest installment from 2K Sports.  While the game features a large number of new features that really bolster the feel of the college experience, play on the court is still plagued by some old issues that really detract from the impressive job made by Visual Concepts.   Last year, College Hoops 2K7 focused on the atmosphere surrounding a college game, which included the student sections screaming, fans jumping in their seats and tons of school chants.  Of course, every basketball fan knows that this atmosphere can be enough to completely disrupt the concentration of opponents, forcing poor shots and lapses in judgment that can benefit the home team.  The crowd can also buoy their squad, making them play much harder as they feed off the energy of the stands.  This is the 6th Man Advantage, and College Hoops 2K8 tries to recreate this in the midst of games in a dynamic way.  As the home team makes plays, getting baskets and performing defensive stops or forcing turnovers, a meter along the bottom of the screen fills up with the crowd's excitement at the game.  If you keep this performance up, you can turn the bar red for a couple of seconds, which equates to a momentum boost for your players (which can be seen underneath the players as a marker of their confidence on the court).  This boost makes shots easier to go in for your team, and can be extended with additional shots or strong defense.  This can be just enough to give your players a way to extend a lead or make a roaring comeback when it really counts.   Click here to watch the video review.   The opposing side isn't completely shut out during this energetic period.  In fact, if they force turnovers or get some momentum of their own, they can completely negate the advantages of this feature.  It's a cool feature that makes the back-and-forth nature found within the college game feel very realistic.  However, the energy of the crowd can sometimes come off at inappropriate times, which feels disjointed to the action on the court.  For instance, I was playing as UCLA at Pauley Pavillion against USC, and while I'd pumped up the crowd, the Bruin fans were screaming their heads off as my point guard was sent to the foul line to shoot two shots. Instead of quieting down, they continued their cheering and howling, which seems a bit odd considering that their noise died down when USC went to the charity stripe a few minutes later.  The other oddity is that some shots you'll make when you're in the momentum boosting period of the 6th Man Advantage will completely reset the meter instead of prolonging it during play.  While it's understandable that the crowd won't constantly stay amped up throughout the entire game, it's a bit hard to see why one basket will extend the confidence of your squad and the next made bucket will bring the hype back down to normal.   One thing that would've destroyed the confidence of most teams, especially in last year's game, was the passing from ball handlers.  Frequently, you'd throw the ball to someone you didn't want it to go to, or the lane that was open based on the play you were running would close and result in a turnover.  Plus, the ball handler wouldn't put any power on these tosses, frequently lobbing these passes into the hands of an eager defender.  College Hoops 2K8 tries to get around this with the inclusion of Maximum Passing, which allows you to designate a player and perform one of four different passes to your teammate, such as a bounce, lob or lead pass.  These won't be lightly tossed either; instead, your players will frequently put some mustard on these throws as they fling the ball around the court.  However, you will find that even with the inclusion of Maximum Passing, getting around the frequent turnovers from last year hasn't fully been solved.  For one thing, the icons for your players, particularly in transition, will switch back and forth between your teammates quickly.  Since you use these markers to indicate who you're passing to before selecting the kind of pass, that switch is often enough to confuse the ball handler, making them hurl the ball out of bounds or mis-time the toss.  As a result, passes will sometimes go at the feet of players or into the hands of opponents, which doesn't necessarily solve the whole turnover issue at all.   Can you feel the excitement?  It's game time! Lock-On Defense has also been included in this year's game, which was initially showcased in NBA 2K8.  The concept of Lock-On Defense is supposed to help position defenders in front of ball handlers, minimizing their chances of getting a step on a player and blowing past them.  Unfortunately, it appears that Lock-On D still suffers from the same issues that were found in the NBA version of the game.  Just about anyone, including slow lanky centers, can shut down speedy point guards with this feature, hampering their progress or forcing them out of bounds once Lock-On D is triggered.  The concept is good, but the implementation of it still needs to be worked on to avoid the unbalancing of gameplay.   That actually brings me to one other issue with the game, which is that there are still a number of older problems with College Hoops 2K8 that haven't been fixed.  Players still blow the easiest layups with no one covering them, which is simply absurd.  I've seen players actually layup into the rim or grab a rebound and brick a shot over and over again, which is horrendous.  Furthermore, we played a number of games in the office and found that some calls, such as backcourt or lane violations won't even be made by the referees, which is horrible.  Similarly, we also noted instances where boundary or character model detection was a bit spotty.  We witnessed ball handlers running along baseline and stopped by an invisible barrier that prevented them from going out of bounds.  Other times, it took defenders a long time to re-establish themselves back on the court after they went out of bounds after trying to intercept a pass.    Some play sets are also rather strange.  We've witnessed a number of defensive sets in particular where instead of shifting your forwards or guards into the correct area for a zone, they have an unnatural tendency to bunch together and clog the lane. We also saw some guys that were driving the lane held in place by someone trying to draw a charge.  The charge wasn't drawn, nor was the defender knocked over - instead, both players were stuck in place for a few seconds without any effect, which was pretty strange to see. Issues like this are rather annoying and distracting to the overall title, especially considering some of the adjustments made to other facets of the game. Dribbling, for instance, has been revamped yet again with a brand new system.  Last year took the setup of Isomotion and mapped the controls to a few buttons in concert with the analog stick.  This feature returns this year, although this time around, players will find that many more of their moves are tied to their momentum as they're running along the court as well as their hand positioning.  This will actually affect the direction that a player will spin in, as well as how they will make their hesitation steps or other moves, and really makes sense in the context of ball handling.   Another tweak that's been added to this year's game is the Coaching Adjustments feature during halftime.  Much more than a simple substitution or pressure scheme that can be triggered during a time out, the Coaching Adjustment analyzes how you are playing on the court in the first half of the game, and provides different suggestions or comments on what you're doing well, what's being screwed up and how you can improve your play for the second half.  Players can pick and choose which (if any) of the suggestions that they want to implement, and the game will respond accordingly, with the sideline reporters commenting on your changes and how they would affect your squad's play.  This is a pretty cool feature that really adds to the atmosphere on and off the court.  There is one strange thing with this mode though.  If you happen to play a two-player game, only the home team can make these coaching adjustments.  Visiting squads will simply have to deal with their substitutions and shifts during timeouts, which feels a bit unbalanced.   Do you have the moves to score on this defense? Speaking of off the court, a number of changes have been made so that when you're not trying to beat an opponent, you can always expand upon your skills.  First of all, players who feel like they've got better sets than the zone, man to man or isolation plays can take on the Play Designer feature and draw up their own offensive and defensive sets.  This is an incredibly robust feature that provides anyone with the tools they need to make any odd play they can think of, and run through it in a practice arena.  What's extremely cool about that feature is that you can also test your set against different offensive and defensive plays to check its effectiveness.  If you like what you see, you can then export your created play to any playbook in the game, making your creation come to life for your favorite squad.  This is a great idea, and one that will definitely have a lot of use for basketball fans.   This year, College Hoops 2K8 also features accessible tips on every single menu screen just in case you find yourself confused on the section of the game you're in.  It also presents two different kinds of tutorial modes thanks to the Tutorial and All American Challenge features.  Tutorial runs players through the basics of specific moves, such as Maximum Passing, Isomotion moves and low post play by running a demonstration of the action before giving you a chance to try your hand at the activity.  You can select as many tasks to run through as you wish, and you can skip through ones that you're having difficulty with or have mastered to get to other steps.   If you're not doing well, go in at halftime and make some coaching adjustments. The All-American Challenge, on the other hand, is a series of fourteen drills that tests your abilities on the court.  Some of these are relatively simple, such as line drills or ball handling, while others are a bit more in-depth, such as shooting drills from different areas on the court or low post offense and defense.  This is a great way of running through exercises that you'd find any team running at practice, and a nice way of seeing whether there are any weaknesses to your game.  You can even take on star athletes, such as J.J. Redick, Greg Oden and Glen Davis in various drills once you've gotten good enough. However, there's also a side benefit to the All-American Challenge, because you're going to wind up using these same drills to augment the stats of your players in the Legacy Mode, running them through their paces via development exercises to boost their stats.   Legacy Mode, for the most part, is exactly the same as last year, with team unity playing a large role in keeping your athletes pumped up over the course of the season as you win and lose games.  Of course, you're balancing the needs of your players with playing time and working on building for the future of your squad with your recruiting.  In previous years, you could only gain info on prospective blue chips by constantly emailing them, requesting game tapes or visiting them in person.  This year, recruiting is handled in a new way thanks to the newly included ABL (or amateur basketball league) feature.  During the offseason, 1500 recruitable players from high schools around the country are placed onto 128 different teams, all of whom play for a national championship of their own.  While you can simulate through these games and skip them entirely, there are multiple reasons for playing through these exhibitions.    Playing the matches gives you a better sense of a player's skills on the court, which helps you figure out whether or not you want to pursue them during a recruiting session.  In the case of a star in the making, you get an idea of the other schools that are interested in adding that player to their squads, so you know just how hard you need to work to get that student's attention.  The final reason why you want to play these games is because you get bonus recruit points, which can be used to help seal the deal once you've gotten an athlete interested in your school.  The inclusion of the ABL places a brand new and more interactive spin on the older, more esoteric stats of incoming players, and is a much better way of playing the Legacy Mode.   Not in my house, kid! The on-court action is visually strong, with a couple of tweaks to last year's formula.  College Hoops 2K7 featured a lot of players on teams that facially looked quite similar.  The team attempted to vary this somewhat with a couple of adjustments so teams didn't look like they were cookie cutouts of the same character model.  For the most part, it works well, with different hairstyles here and there, although you'll still pick up on some players that have the same facial structure with a skin tone change.  The atmosphere of the various arenas are pretty good, although some of the fans in the stands have the tendency to look either generic or much less detailed than those characters nearer to the court.  They also have a tendency to animate a bit more stiffly than other characters, and while that hasn't changed, the manner in which it's melded with the rest of the atmospheric elements of the game makes a match-up feel like it's contained at a school arena. The PS3 version does show off a lot more seams on the character models, however, and there are some instances during games, such as replays or in arenas with large numbers of students in the foreground, where the game drops frames and chugs along.  It does wind up hampering the speed of some plays or timing of some shots when you realize that fast breaks are slowed down thanks to the game not keeping up the frame rate.   Considering that the 6th Man Advantage is a key facet to the atmosphere of the game, along with school chants and court noise, you'd expect that College Hoops 2K8 would deliver in the sound department.  You'd be right, especially when it comes to hearing the crowd roar because of a good play or jeer the other team.  If you don't laugh at the students screaming, ~You Need Practice,~ when your opponents start missing shots, you must be deaf.  While 2K supports the game with its trademark large soundtrack, the title also comes with quite a lot of vocal delivery from Vern Lundquist and Bill Rafferty, as well as Greg Gumbel and Clark Kellogg. This year, instead of finding Bonnie Bernstein on the sidelines, Tracy Wolfson picks up her reporting duties, and does a great job of filling in with comments and dialogue, particularly in response to any Coaching Adjustments made.  Unfortunately, Bill and Vern's dialogue can sometimes be either stale or behind the action on the screen.  For instance, you may hear Bill call out that your defense is in man to man multiple seconds after you've switched to zone, or hear Vern comment on a play that wrapped up a while earlier.   I believe I can fly... Of course, players can also head online for leagues or 64 team tournaments, which has a ton of depth for those looking to test their skills against other people around the country.  However, College Hoops 2K8 includes what could be one of the coolest features for online play thanks to the inclusion of 2K Share.  Much more than simply uploading slider settings to the servers, players can create a roster file and upload everything from chants to playbooks, legacy files and other game features for other players to download and rate.  We weren't able to fully check that feature out because there was nothing to download or test, but we can only imagine that this will add to the community features of the game.Packed with atmosphere and lots of engaging features, such as the revamped Legacy mode and tutorials, College Hoops 2K8 is one of those games that really delivers on the college experience.  The addition of the play designer, as well as the coach adjustment feature, expands of the sense of creating and leading your favorite program to glory.  However, a large amount of gameplay issues, primarily older issues that haven't been fixed for years, casts a bit of a shadow on what is otherwise an impressive title. Plus, the frame issues, model seams and other visual hiccups complicates the PS3 version much more so than the 360.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
