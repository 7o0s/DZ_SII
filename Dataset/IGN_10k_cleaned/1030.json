Indeed, you'll be lucky to find one that bears any resemblance to its big brother: witness, for example, the Turok series. Any good points are often lost in translation; and when there is an attempt to retain the spirit of the game, keeping the factors that made it successful in the first place, the result is often a poorly conceived mess that is all but impossible to play: witness, for example, Grand Theft Auto. Space Station: Silicon Valley, however, marks a long-awaited step in the right direction. It isn't brilliant by any means, boasting a number of annoying flaws that threaten to turn enjoyment to annoyance. What it does do is carry the fresh innovation of the N64 game, while employing it in an method more suited to the Game Boy -- theoretically giving players the best of both worlds. Features: More than thirty levels. Play as a variety of different animals. Multi-lingual menus. Colorful cutscenes. Battery backup saves progress to the cartridge. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  The main selling point of Silicon Valley is the ability to 'possess' a menagerie of different animals and employ their skills to solve the puzzle-filled levels. The space station was to be an experiment in artificial life and robotic evolution - before it vanished seven minutes after being launched. One thousand years later, it has suddenly returned into orbit, raising numerous questions about what happened. Five Marine squads have gone to investigate the station, only to disappear (as they tend to do), leaving it up to the brave Dan Danger and his super-intelligent, self-evolving robotic pet, Evo. The story works suprisingly well, posing many questions, certainly a step above the average excuse for an adventure.  The game is split up into many short levels, based around tasks such as returning power to areas of the station and guiding sheep into their pens (yes, it's often crazy). You control Evo the robot, Dan relegated to the task of advising from his shuttle. Evo needs to be in the body of another animal to sustain himself: whilst in his own form, his bar energy bar rapidly depletes. Find an animal, press 'select', and Evo will leap inside it. Of course, the animals are only robots - so the black-humor derived from their manipulation can in no way encourage cruelty.  Each creature possesses a number of unique abilities: the racing-foxes, for example, can quickly teleport across long gaps; and the woolly coats of the sheep enable them to float as they jump (I've been unable to get this to work in real life: don't try it unless you're willing to take responsibility for some serious mess). The levels feature different puzzles that must be conquered using the appropriate abilities, though the execution is flawed in that there are only a couple of animals to be found in each stage, making it blatantly obvious which abilities must be used.  The design is also fairly poor: the individual sections seem haphazard and randomly strung together, constructed with less thought than they should have been. There are briefings before each level, adding to the originality and the feeling of actually partaking in missions, but they are often vague in telling the player what precisely has to be done, and it's too easy to end up wandering around and stumbling across the solutions by pure chance. More importantly, the tasks that you are required to do are never fun or interesting enough to drive you to complete them. These structural problems represent the game's biggest failing.   Other problems are fairly rampant too. Many of the animals move so slowly that you'll want to throw the console at the wall, which is surprising, as a couple move almost uncontrollably fast. Occasionally, it's difficult to control the critters in other ways also - they simply aren't responsive enough, and their size onscreen makes things very fiddly.  Graphically, the game is at least competent. The backgrounds are usually fairly bland, with little color or detail, but there are no bugs. The sprites are basically animated, but everything is clear and neat, which is more than can be said for some games. The music, on the other hand, is terrible: the very definition of crude and inane, it is the most annoying I've encountered for some time. Some tunes seem to be attempts at jazz - but when constructed from the irritating beeps and blips that this game churns out, every one is a failure. They also bear little or no relation to the onscreen action  - silence would make a far more appropriate backing than this rubbish.   It's a shame that these flaws gang together and ruin the game - it's presented wonderfully, with genuinely funny cutscenes and wonderful-looking menus; and the ideas here are brilliant, wacky and original, entirely faithful to the exceptional N64 game and begging for a chance to shine through the dusty implementation. The game is not destroyed by these problems, but it is definitely hampered severely. If more thought had gone into the gameplay and the design, this could have been fantastic.      It's a brave attempt, but the execution is little more than moderate, showing none of the polish found in Nintendo's own games, despite the multitude of devices that you won't find in many other platformers. It's therefore not as fun as it could be - though the originality makes it worth a look if you think you can stomach its flaws. Just remember to keep the volume down if you're easily antagonized.
