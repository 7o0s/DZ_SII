{"name": "Jurassic Park [Mobile]", "name_review": "Jurassic Park", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/02/24/jurassic-park", "text": "Indiagames has carved out quite a niche in the American mobile gaming landscape with its series of successful, but very literal, adaptations of movie and TV licenses. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Predator, Bruce Lee, Serenity -- none of these are bad games, but they also don't really strive to be excellent games either. Add Jurassic Park to that bunch.   Based on the Steven Spielberg-directed original movie, Indiagames' Jurassic Park borrows a few plot threads to tie together some pretty decent action gaming. All of the characters are present, from Sam Niell's Dr. Grant to Malcolm (played by Jeff ~Jeff Goldblum~ Goldblum), although their in-game portraits are only reasonable approximations of the actors that originated the parts. (Laura Dern's Ellie is a blonde with a bright face, but that's about as far as Indiagames goes without forking over extra cash for likeness rights.) But for the most part, the game only goes for the essence of Jurassic Park -- get off the island -- rather than matching it beat for beat. In the case of a lot of movies, spinning off from the main plot is a necessity, but Jurassic Park was practically a video game to begin with (and I mean that is a very kind way).   As Dr. Grant, you must rush around the island going on fetch quests, finding marooned characters, and blast dinosaurs. The dino action is a little disappointing, as there are not many species worth re-exterminating in JP. The compy hordes scurry around the early stages, and just when you get tired of blasting these reptile rats, the game introduces raptors. But instead of going for even more brutal dinosaurs -- say, a T. Rex -- the game merely throws a slightly more vicious raptor at you in the final few areas. That was kind of a disappointment, as the T. Rex is such an iconic image associated with the license.   The fetching has to do with grabbing circuit boards, keys, flipping switches, and the like. These are elemental game mechanics that work in Jurassic Park, but aren't exactly that compelling. Toward the end of the game, when I would spy a character I needed to hook up with, I immediately would ask, ~I wonder what object he'll send me to get.~ And four out of five times, I was indeed sent off to fetch something. There are a couple switch puzzles that aren't terribly difficult to complete. The game also has 20 DNA canisters strewn about the island that can be collected for bonus points. A lot of them are fairly obvious. On my first run through the game, I picked up 15 of them. But there are a few tricky ones, and I did enjoy sniffing them out to some degree.   So, I've mentioned a few things about Jurassic Park that I thought were okay -- what about the game is handled quite well, then? The general set-up of the island is well done. Instead of a series of traditional side-scrolling levels, the action is viewed from above. There are a bunch of recognizable set pieces like the island hotel, the jungle, the docks, and the labs -- and they are all eventually linked together. While you have only one exit route from the hotel at the beginning, by the end of the game, there is a shortcut to the facility from the exterior of the island. This made it easy for me to pick up a medical kit I left in the hotel because I suspected I would need it later... when I did indeed need it later. The idea of treating the entire island as one large level with multiple sections was a good choice.   I was playing the game last night one last time before prepping my review when my wife casually glanced over at what I was doing and asked, ~Is that Jurassic Park?~ Apparently, Indiagames really nailed the atmosphere for an observer to easily identify the source material with just a single look. Kudos. Dr. Grant looks correct with his panama hat and denim shirt, the raptor sprites are totally recognizable, and the broken dino cages on the island exterior look like they do in the movie.   Jurassic Park can be played on three different difficulty levels, from easy to hard. So you know, easy is very, very easy. As in, you can finish the game in about 35 minutes. The amount of ammo is copious to the point that I finished the game with over 900 shotgun shells left in my inventory and I never even needed to use my rocket launcher. If you want to just see the sights, the easy level is fine, but I recommend players start on medium. Medium isn't necessarily that tough, but at least you'll really need to be slightly choosy with using medical kits and take better aim with shot gun blasts (although, there is a slight auto-aim feature that is appreciated).  Jurassic Park is a decent licensed game that gets the look and feel of its source material correct, but doesn't really stretch for any goal beyond that. I was sorry to see the lack of a large dinosaur cast, as that was half of the fun of the movie -- seeing these beasts brought to life. The basic action of the game -- shooting dinos, fetching items -- is handled fine, but is not necessarily compelling enough to make you want to replay the game over and over. There are certainly better movie-based games out there (and some are made by Indiagames, too -- such as Predator and Serenity), but if you do give into the allure of the Jurassic Park license, you won't be totally disappointed by your choice.", "date": "Feb 24, 2006"}
