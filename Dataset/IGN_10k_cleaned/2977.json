And it's pathetic. Yep, I know I'm straight in there for the kill, but after playing this for a couple of hours, I'm not in a particularly charitable mood -- and I'll tell you why in a minute.  The game features 12 events. On the skiing front, there's downhill, super g, giant slalom, large hill ski jumping and freestyle aerials. There's also snowboarding giant slalom, which isn't really skiing, but it's basically the same thing in this game. Speed skating has four events, speed skating 500 and 1500 and short track 500 and 100. Finally there's bobsleigh, luge and -- the really weird one -- curling.  With that impressive roster of events, Nagano '98 sounds damn cool, and on the face of it, it is. Sporting a great intro, some decent presentation screens and excellent motion capture, the game's attract mode makes it look really good. But playing it is the antithesis of this. For a start, it's slow. All the downhill skiing events are sluggish, suffer from choppy camera movement and have poor control. I always thought skiing was supposed to be an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. Not in this game -- it's slow and frustrating. Oh, and the graphics are sub-par, with draw-in and clipping problems.  Strangely enough, the other two high-speed events, luge and bobsleigh, also suffer from the same problems. The bobsleigh team also have a couple of unfortunate things going for them -- firstly, their asses are halfway up their backs thanks to some of the crummiest-looking polygonal athletes seen in ages, and their spectators are about twice their size due to some unfortunate trackside graphic perspective problems. This adds some much-needed, if unintentional light relief, because otherwise both events are miserable, packing spastic camera movement, vague control and average graphics.  The jumping events are much better -- both are good fun and prove addictive in the short term -- and curling is a really good mini-game that's by far the best event of the lot. But the speed skating events quickly shoot down that glimmer of hope for the rest of the events. They're not particularly badly done and their graphics are good, but when it comes down to it, they're just simplistic and dull -- basically it's four similar skating events with slightly different controls.  Overall, the game is challenging. Qualifying in each event takes a lot of time and patience, but due to the fact that the game is generally so shoddy and the fact that the bulk of the action is choppy and slow, you just don't feel compelled to keep playing. If you want a multi-event sports simulation that's fun, check out International Track and Field, the game that Konami released to coincide with the Atlanta '96 Olympics. It might be 18 months older than this, but it's far more playable and looks miles better than this shambling disappointment.  Jaz RignallNagano Winter Olympics '98 is a flawed game with a few highlights that has ~hurry and get it out in time for the Olympics~ written all over it. There is virtually nothing here that even comes close to Sega's Winter Heat, or Epyx's classic Winter Games. If the TV-coverage of the Games isn't enough for you, you will probably want to rent Nagano for a day or two -- but be warned that this is not a good multiplayer title. Konami has shown what it can do with International Superstar Soccer (programmed by its in-house team ~Major A~), but Diamond Dusts's first 64-bit effort will leave you out in the cold. This one won't win any medals. Okay, I'll stop with the puns, but please don't buy this game.", "date": "Jan 31, 1998"}
