{"name": "F-1 Race", "name_review": "F-1 Race", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/23/f-1-race", "text": "The love affair with the automobile is a widespread phenomenon. Driving a fast car down a road with no speed limits is a dream that many daring motorists share. If you are the type with a need for speed, than Nintendo's F-1 Race may be the video game vehicle to deliver it. This Formula One racing simulation will test your reflexes as you steer your way along an assortment of winding tracks.   Features   Single-player or Multi-player with the Game Boy Game Link (sold separately). Battery-backed memory. Three racing modes. Nine different tracks. Excellent to Good game control. Difficulty level: Medium to Hard.   The Game  F-1 Race's title screen offers three different racing options: Grand Prix, Time Trials, and Multi Game. In Grand Prix, you can race on nine tracks located in different parts of the world (Russia, Japan, and U.S., for example). You can advance from track to track only by finishing first out of a field of ten cars. The tracks increase in difficulty as you progress. It takes Andretti-like dexterity to beat the competition to the checkered flag on all nine raceways. Each race is two laps long. Time Trials pits the racer versus the road and the clock. In this mode you can choose to race solo or against a field of other vehicles in order to achieve the best lap time on any track. The top three times for each track are saved in battery backed memory. Multi Game lets you race against up to three other people (with the two- or four-player link) or against the computer-controlled opponents. There are three courses consisting of three tracks per course. These are the same tracks found in Grand Prix and Time Trials. All races are three laps long. Points and pole positions are assigned depending on how each racer places at the finish of each track.   The racer has a choice of two cars with which to compete: Type A and Type B. Type A turns corners better while Type B has a higher top speed. Each car contains a certain amount of jet fuel that boosts speed until it runs out. The car you choose to use will vary, depending on the design of the track you are racing.   The game's traditional viewpoint lets the player face the track from behind the racing vehicles. F-1 Race does a good job in creating the sensation of speed, as your surroundings tend to blur as you accelerate. Foreground scenery includes repetitively scrolling mountains, cityscapes, clouds, etc. What you see in terms of skyline depends on the country in which the track is located. The Russia track, for instance, offers Kremlin-like buildings while the Australian course displays a series of mountain ranges. The initial novelty of the changing scenery wears off quickly, however. Also of dismay is the bland-looking land that borders the raceways. No scenery of any kind can be found to either the left or the right of the track-all that is seen are diagonal stripes that fail to create any type of unique graphical landscape. Every so often on certain stretches of track, the racer will encounter signs that stand to the side of the road, but that's it as far as graphics go. Granted, in normal Formula One racing, there's not much to look at besides the track anyway. But as the designers bothered to place the tracks in exotic locations, they might as well have finished the effect and given the driver something to look at along the way. In contrast, the cute racer animations that are seen in the Multi Game mode add a bit of eye candy and humor to the game, but these take place outside of the actual racing context. Though watching the Multi Game's trophy ceremony scene is amusing, the experience does not compensate for the graphical monotony of F-1 Race's main attraction: the racing tracks. Overall, the game could do with a bit of improvement in this area.    Like the game's graphics, the music falls a little short in the memorable category. While the title screen music revs and hums like a racing engine, the other songs don't seem to capitalize on the same theme. The tunes strike the listener as neither especially annoying nor particularly incredible, and take a backseat to the actual racing action. There is no way to control the music except by adjusting the volume dial.   The sound effects, on the other hand, do a better job in helping to create an authentic racing atmosphere. From the squealing brakes to the high-pitched engine whine, the assortment of sounds adds fun to game and contributes to its sensory appeal.    F-1 Race offers a simplistic (but not necessarily easy) racing experience. The game's nine tracks are notable only because of the treacherous steering challenges they pose the driver. No other formidable obstacles, however, are presented to test the driver's skills. Those who wish to push their reflexes to the limit will find a lot of value in this game, especially when playing the exciting Multi Game mode. But aside from F-1 Race's instinctive response aspects, there is not enough game depth or strategical challenge to attract a person to play repeatedly.  F-1 Race is an adequate simulation if you are seeking a fast, straightforward racing experience with no frills. Played every once in a while, it provides a nice rush. Played repeatedly, though, and the game's design flaws become more apparent. As far as bells and whistles are concerned, F-1 Race doesn't quite cross the finish line first.
