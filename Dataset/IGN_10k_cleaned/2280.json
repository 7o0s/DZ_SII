It just makes you get all flustered and hot under the collar about racing cars. It makes you sweat like Tal in a sauna, or just like Tal. It makes you jump up and down screaming like a little girl while juggling crab cakes and singing ~I can't drive, FITFY FIVE!!~ But unfortunately, the excitement I felt about the idea didn't translate over to the actual game quite as much. The problem is I'm not sure if this is a result of the game itself (it does have some problems) or the pricing plan that goes along with it. I mean, c'mon, the idea of a massively multiplayer racing game is pretty freaking fantastic. The thoughts of Cannonball Run and Driver race through my head when I hear that, but it just isn't the case. Not only is it not really massively multiplayer, but at times it can be hard to tell that it's multiplayer at all. The lack of players in the game to compete against is a huge drawback from what would probably have been a fun, if flawed, experience.  So let's talk a little about what the game actually turned out to be. It's basically a great community site for people to get together, race, and trade cars and parts in a slightly RPGesque leveling up way. While it isn't what I expected from the game originally, it's still a pretty good idea. A racing game that allows people to build their own cars, race them around, have an easy time of hooking up for multiplayer races, and participate in events. The community tools are pretty good, if a little slow, and trading cars, racing for pink slips, running auctions, and checking out time trial bests is all good. There's plenty of info about the community where you can see which players are the richest, which are the most successful, and all of that jazz. It does a commendable job at bringing gamers into and making them feel a part of the community as a whole.  While the game is mostly about racing, it also has an RPG sort of structure to it. When you start off in the game, you'll be considered a newbie. After garnering enough experience points, which you collect by completing races and getting good times in time trials, you'll increase in level and eventually in rank. Every time you increase in level, you'll get a pay increase. You get paid... I'm not sure how often. It doesn't say in the manual and I forgot to ask in the game, but I wasn't waiting around to make money anyway. Eventually after gaining enough levels, you'll gain in rank as well. Not only will you get the pay increase, but you'll also get a bonus.   Money makes the world go around in real life and it does in MCO as well. There's a dynamic economics system in the game that will actually react to supply and demand and as prices fluctuate, enterprising individuals will have the opportunity to make some bank and get a pretty good garage full of cars. It's pretty hard to start out because you have very little money. Money is made either through trade and auctioning off your stuff, or through the main point of the game: races. You can race your own car, which can be damaged so you'll have to spend money repairing it, or you can race a sponsored car that you don't have to take responsibility for. Higher risk equals higher reward, so if you race your own car you'll most likely get a bigger payoff. But in order to get going, you'll need to race in a lot of sponsored races to get the money to even come close to being competitive with the rest of the racers with your own jitney.  Actually buying parts and upgrading your car can be a little bit of a pain. The interface in this particular section, when it should be easier, is a little slow, clunky and really doesn't give enough information that a layperson like myself can understand. Basically, when you head in to buy a part, you'll select which part of the car it's for. Whether it's an engine upgrade for power, or something to help your aerodynamics, you select the general part and a list will pop up of all those that can fit your particular car (or all of them for every car if you want). The problem is, it's really kind of hard to tell how a particular part is helping you out. If the info had been a little easier to read like it was in 4x4 Evo where it tells you what you'll be gaining and what you'll be losing in no uncertain terms, it would have been much nicer. As it is, I pretty much just guessed and went with some of the higher priced parts because they must be better, right?  And once you put your car together to get out racing, or even if you don't put your car together and race anyway, you aren't going to be super impressed by what you see. Even running the thing on a Athlon Thunderbird 1.4 with 512 MB RAM and a GeForce3, it's not that pretty. And when running on a PIII 600 with 256MB of RAM and a GeForce2, there was a little slowdown. Not so good.  Races themselves should be easy enough to find. There's a racing center that shows how many people there are in each of the different racing styles. There's street racing, circuit racing, drag racing, and time trial for both your own car and sponsored cars. Unfortunately, when you go into the races, there are very few games available even at peak hours of the day. There were times when I sat with a game created waiting for someone to come along and join for a long, long time. And if you try to join a game that is already set up, it always seems to be that people clump together on just a couple of tracks.  Basically this means that you'll be racing the same thing over and over again to get enough money to buy the next part and get to the next level.  You can go and race by yourself in the time trials and you will get some money and points for them, but not nearly as much as you can make in actual races. Of course, there is more incentive to race the trials as the best time by the end of the week will be rewarded with a huge amount of points towards their next level.    So the big question has to be whether the actual racing part of the game is good enough to put up with the lack of people to race against. Well, I found myself keeping on racing when there was enough people to race against, but that might have been because I was just so excited to be able to race against other people instead of a clock. I've seen some pretty wacky things happen in the time I've played the game. There's plenty of problems with lag where you'll see someone just go speeding by you at what looks like incredible speeds, and can therefore cause a whole lot of problems when it comes to accidents. One accident in particular caused a racer that was behind me to speed up so fast that he launched off of my car's back only to fly headlong into a wall at speeds impossible for the car he was in control of to normally attain. Just plain bizarre. There's a lot of that happening in games. Fortunately, the driving model isn't exactly a sim model so you can get over some of that stuff. That is, unless it happens to you near the end of a long, hard fought race.  But accidents in general are something that I have a problem with. I've found that it's pretty easy to totally ruin one of your opponent's chances by barely nudging them in the back corner of the car. More often than not it will be enough to send them spinning off into a wall, sometimes taking out a couple other cars in the process. I know this is possible because I did it a couple of times just for the hell of it and had it done to me even more times. There's nothing more frustrating than being poked in the rear by a dirty driver although it's hard to complain because accidents really do happen and when there is no real penalty for causing them, no one is going to be inclined to be really careful. If you happen to be racing against someone with pink slips on the line, you're going to be really ticked if they use a dirty trick on you and take your car.  I guess one of my problems is there's just better racing games out there on the market. If it wasn't for the community aspects of the game, there would be plenty other games better than this. Hell, if Midtown Madness 2 had a community like this is would be a pile better than this. So the question you really have to ask yourself before you go out and plunk a bunch of money on the game is it really worth the extra $10 a month to play this? I don't think so. There's just not enough going on here. This isn't a massively multiplayer persistent world we're talking about here. It's community tools. And as of right now there doesn't seem to be much of a community.  If more people had the game and were willing to pay the price of membership, there would be more value here. Maybe down the line if more people decide to pick it up... But as it is, only racing game freaks are really going to want to shell the monthly fee out for this one and there aren't nearly as many of those as there are RPG or FPS freaks. And this isn't even one of the better racing games I've played. There are bugs, network problems, and I lost track of how many times the game crashed so completely that I had to hit the power button on my computer. Even though this is a good idea for a community and the bugs and crashes might even be semi-tolerable if there were more people playing, I can't really recommend that people buy this one unless they are part of that real racing freak section of the gaming populace. Of course the paradox there is if they are racing freaks, then they might not like the average racing model presented to them.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
