THQ Wireless is the next team on the field, following JAMDAT's solid attempt at delivering a mobile NFL experience. Can THQ Wireless, with its healthy playbook and complete NFL license, truly advance the ball?   Features:   Official NFL and NFL Players, Inc. licenses  11-on-11 play  Quick or Season play   NFL Football 2005 (not to be confused with JAMDAT's similarly titled NFL 2005) differentiates itself from the current pack that includes Sorrent by featuring a full NFL license. That means all 32 teams with full rosters and uniforms have been squeezed into this itty-bitty package. But actually being able to flash ~Farve~ on-screen doesn't mean squat if it's worth the download. Fortunately, NFL Football 2005 is.   THQ Wireless is taking a different approach to football than its main competitors. While JAMDAT and Sorrent has somewhat streamlined the sport by either reducing the number of on-screen players or juicing it with some arcade trimmings, THQ Wireless is going for a more classic sim feeling. For example, NFL Football 2005 features pure 11-on-11 action and stat tracking over an entire season. Gamers looking for a pocket sim are likely going to be well served by NFL Football 2005.   Gamers can either attempt a full season of football leading up to the Super Bowl, or just jump right into a quick play session. Now, while game play is always king, when it comes time to select teams, there really is something to be said for actually being able to pick the ~Chicago Bears,~ not just the vanilla ~Chicago.~ Then it's right to the coin toss and the kick-off.   Control is pretty good. Notice we said ~pretty good.~ Let's face it, a handset just isn't the best set-up for a football sim. When you're trying to worry about 22 players, fumbling with a touchpad and number keys is something of a bummer. The touchpad always controls the selected player, but the bottom row of the number pad changes depending on whether you are playing offense or defense. You do have options like jumping and diving, as well as switching players.   NFL Football 2005 has a decently thick playbook with plenty of options for defense and offense. It also has a handy feature that recommends specific plays depending on the situation, which is going to be immensely helpful for novices. However, we were spoiled by the excellent playbook menu system in NFL 2005. NFL Football 2005's playbook is full, but it's not as easy to compare plays.   NFL Football 2005 also includes an intriguing two-player mode that works better in theory than in practice. Using a single handset, players hand the cellphone back and forth to play offense. The computer plays defense for you. While attempting multiplayer is always good, this system just doesn't appeal. Who likes being in control only half of the time?   THQ Wireless' game looks okay. We tested NFL Football 2005 on a Motorola V600, which features a very nice, clean, and bright screen. NFL Football 2005 didn't really do it justice. Perhaps zooming out to accommodate 22 players forced THQ Wireless to ditch some detail, but the overall ~plain-ness~ of the game was something of a turn-off. The audio is decent, with an array of grunts when players tackle each other, as well as whistles and small musical flourishes.  NFL Football 2005 is a good football game for those needing absolute authenticity. If 11-on-11 action, full NFL line-ups, and stat tracking are important to you, then you best download NFL Football 2005 over its competition. None of these games are going to give you the best control, but at least NFL Football 2005's is on par with the pack. Gamers should be grateful they have a lot of options this fall for football, and THQ Wireless should be proud they made a good contender.", "date": "Sep 2, 2004"}
