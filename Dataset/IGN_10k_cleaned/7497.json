The game's sad state is a bit of a tragedy actually, as the first couple of minutes gave us the impression that it could be fun. Looking past the ultra-low-res menu and into its options, the potential is certainly there -- you can create multiple virtual families from scratch and unlock new clothing items to vary your customization options. There are more than 1000 questions that the show's digital host will ask you, plus five different studios from throughout the decades to contrast the background scenery. Players can even participate in the traditional Family Feud ~300 Point~ match or bust out a ~Quick Game~ and zoom through as many questions as possible. Oh, and if they're really feeling froggy, users can also connect online and take on opponents from all over North America. Sounds like it might be entertaining... right?   Wrong.    Everything about Family Feud screams ~rush job.~ By its very nature, it should be easy to get into and diverse enough between games to keep you coming back for more. But it isn't. Why? To start, there's no way to skip the voice-overs from the host who repeats every question to all five members of your family in every round of every game. What's more, the subtitled text is usually several beats behind the vocals and the CPU even adds ~thinking time~ so that you can mull the answer over. Put all this together and a simple game of ~The Feud~ can last longer than the actual TV show -- especially if you're using the somewhat-delayed virtual keyboard and not a supported USB peripheral.   The wait might not be so bad if the trivia structure itself wasn't broken. But on multiple occasions, we missed various questions because we incorrectly spelled a word by just one letter, only to get other answers right with words we never answered with at all! As an example, if you add an extra ~F~ to Schwarzkopf you'll end up with an infamous red X. However, answer a question with the phrase ~canvas,~ and you'll be credited with saying ~paper~ if applicable. Huh?   Here's another weird problem for you. In more than a dozen games against the CPU, half of them made us feel like the ~fix was in.~ During a face-off question, the computer would answer the survey correctly with entirely the right spelling only to be told that it was wrong. But as soon as it was our turn, we would give the exact same answer and get it right. How can this be? Was the computer secretly plotting against itself? Did it conveniently ~forget~ the answers? I had to double check our family nametags to see if they read ~Stempel.~ They didn't.   Problems like these go on and on. Whether it's the fact that you can never lose a race to the buzzer during a face-off or that the countdown clock is never consistent from round to round (sometimes it counts, sometimes it doesn't), there's always some kind of setback that makes itself known. And don't even get us started on the visuals -- they're unsightly in every aspect imaginable and look like they're straight out of the PS1 era.Ugly is the word best used to describe Family Feud. It's clunky, slow-moving, poorly drawn, and has an AI that's as dumb as a box of rocks. In short, it just isn't any fun to play and every trivia game that's come down the pipe for the last couple of years run circles around it... yes, even Friends.", "date": "Nov 2, 2006"}
