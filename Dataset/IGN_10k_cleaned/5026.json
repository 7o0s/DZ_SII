In the case of Nautilus and Midway's latest RPG sequel, Shadow Hearts: Covenant, that's exactly what happened -- as I've been completely and totally blindsided by how good it is. Going in, I knew that it would at least be pretty decent, as I was a fan of the original's unique battle system and thought that the character designs and music were pretty good (I never did agree with the review that we posted for it, but alas, that was before my time). What I walked away with after playing the sequel extensively, however, was something that's so far beyond ~decent~ it isn't even funny. I had just experienced one of the best role-playing games this year.   A Tale of Two (Hundred) Cities  Now unlike the mainline Final Fantasy sequels, Shadow Hearts is a direct continuation of the storyline established in the first game. Taking place two years after the events of the original and not too long after the start of World War I, our chronicle begins in a dramatic fashion with the return of familiar face. Set within the eerie deserted village of Domremy in Northern France, a cautious unit of Elite German soldiers are quickly and brutally wiped out by a giant winged demon in the town church. Of course, the number one reason that the Imperial Army hasn't taken this village yet is because of this demon -- which is, as you might have guessed, the paranormal badass Yuri from the previous game. There is one survivor, though, a young female lieutenant known as Karin Koenig, who's left unharmed by the protective Yuri because of her resemblance to someone he once knew (one guess as to who that is!). After debriefing her superiors in Germany of the situation, the game begins for real when her superiors send Karin and a new ally, an exorcist named Nicholai, on a quest to take over the town.    What follows is an event that players who are unfamiliar with the original probably won't expect, but suffice it to say, Yuri comes back to the party and brings his Harmonixer abilities with him. Well okay, so that's not entirely true -- Yuri has lost all of his monster transformation powers because of a curse given to him by a mysterious secret society. For a good while afterwards, the whole premise of the adventure is to travel the world in search of this secret society to find out why Yuri has been cursed, what can be done to remove it, and to discover what the enemy's true plan really is.   Along the way gamers can expect to run into a nice assortment of colorful characters that live in real world locations. Paris, Wales, Cannes, and Yokohama are but a few of these actual places than can be moderately explored, and the dialogue and revelations made inside of them are extremely helpful for your motivation. The reason for this is because the plot twists and the characters that help to tell it are so incredibly interesting and diverse, that it's hard to think of another RPG this year that offers a storyline this compelling. Perhaps only Atlus' equally fascinating Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne is able to stand toe-to-toe with it in terms of the strength of its narrative, but because of that game's vague pacing and bizarre thematic, chances are that Shadow Hearts' plot will likely win over the masses.   And truthfully it would be hard to see how it couldn't win, as Covenant's cast of personalities are really easy to fall in love with. For one, the lead character Yuri has really grown and changed since his first appearance in the previous game -- but he still hasn't lost his dark sense of humor or sarcastic mannerisms. In fact, a great deal of the game walks a series of tonal lines in terms of dialogue and setting, and that's one of the great feats that Shadow Hearts manages to pull off. Because not only does it manage to be appropriately dark and terrifying at all the right moments (and yes there are some seriously scary bits), the game still somehow brings a range of different humorous situations to the table that you wouldn't otherwise expect. It wouldn't be any stretch of the imagination to call it the Evil Dead 2 of the videogame world. And contrary to your possible opinions of that series, that's supposed to be compliment.    But yes, when it comes to supporting characters Shadow Hearts: Covenant has it all. And whether it's the aforementioned sexy but determined German officer Karin, the crotchety old puppeteer Gepetto, or the heroic but vampiric professional wrestler Joachim that get your goat, there's a lot of fun to be had here. And just wait until you meet some of the other more advanced characters that appear later into the adventure -- they're even more interesting and bizarre in their own little ways (though Joachim is still my favorite). Throw in the fact that skimpy outfits, modern slang, and assload of magic populate this alternate 1915 universe, and you have yourself more personality than you can probably handle.   Ignore Beauty and Be Without it  But personality is something that can walk a fine line if not done properly, and luckily for us, Shadow Hearts: Covenant does it extremely well. A strong supporting aspect to the plot and its players, the voice-over work in Covenant is professionally performed -- with a great deal of contrasting styles and fitting vocals assigned to each and every one of the key characters. Joachim, for example, speaks as though he were an old-school superhero; with an over-the-top delivery and a booming voice just a few notches shy of Buzz Lightyear. The game's hero Yuri, on the other hand, subtly conveys the idea that he's a lonely, angry, and generally sarcastic all-powerful bastard that carries a lot of baggage. On the whole, it's several steps beyond that terrible verbal disaster that was Square Enix's Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, and it seems to offer up a lot more speech than that game did as well. Score one for the little guys!    Another welcome addition to the Shadow Hearts presentation is the strong musical soundtrack. Composed once again by Yoshitaka Hirota and Yasunori Mitsuda (with a little help from Kenji Ito), the game's music may not be as strong as the original's, but it's still very pleasing to the ear. Made up primarily of industrial tunes and some rough techno tracks, Covenant's score also boasts some appropriately eerie organ themes that help set the mood in its most serious moments. My only real problem with this is that the BGM that plays when exploring dungeons rarely diverts or even changes from the same specific song for most of the adventure. And as strong as the dungeon theme may be, it would have been great to see a little variety here.   Luckily we get that variety by way of the game's excellent art direction and high-end graphics. Though not as sharp as say, Dark Cloud 2 or Final Fantasy X, Shadow Hearts' use of texture is pretty varied and heavily layered. No matter where it is you travel in the world, each city looks exactly like it's supposed to, with a nice mix of color, occasional weather effects, and lighting to help round out the package. Jaggy-haters may want to take note, however, that Covenant does boasts a number of them in addition to a rather high dose of that classic PS2 shimmer. But even so, the quality of the environments and the special effects used to bring them to life more than make up for it.   Of particular note is how well the game's directors have captured the proper emotions. A key aspect in the more personal RPGs like Xenosaga and Twilight of the Spirits, the ability to successfully convey the feelings of a game's characters have always helped them go that extra mile for me (which is probably why I like the typically panned Final Fantasy VIII so much -- that game had heart damn it!). Much like those games, Shadow Hearts uses a combination of clever camera angles, solid pacing, and dead-on lip-synching to keep its protagonists as expressive as possible. Cinematic role-playing fans unite!   Oh, but I'd be totally remiss if I forgot to mention how unique the art direction in Covenant is in comparison to most other ~historic~ videogames. Though set in Europe and Asia, in the year 1915, it takes a very cutting edge approach in terms of character design and stage decoration. So while it's not uncommon to find people walking around in suits and dresses that were appropriate for the time, it's also not uncommon to find skintight halter tops adorning the female leads, with S&M-inspired whipmasters and scantily-clad belly dancing fortunetellers. Needless to say, it's earned every bit of that teen rating.    Passing Judgment  As strong as the presentation and storyline elements are in Shadow Hearts: Covenant, it's the gameplay system that ultimately seals the deal. Essentially combining the Attack Wheel idea of Grandia with an emphasis on creating team-oriented combos, the game has one of the most interactive turn-based battle systems I've played. Compared to the 2001 original, the flow of the combat is a lot more organic too, and provides several more options to players for increased strategy.   Now in the off chance you've never seen the Shadow Hearts fight mechanic in action before, it's actually pretty simple: using what's called the Judgment Ring, players are given access to a circular roulette-like wheel whenever a specific action has been selected from their menu -- be it an attack, a magical spell, item usage, or whatever. And at the end of that wheel, is a constantly moving target needle that can then be stopped by a tap of the X button whenever you command it to. Of course, the only time you want that needle to stop is when it passes over one of several possible hit zones that lay on top of the Ring. How many hit zones are available depends on what character is selected, what action they're performing, and so on -- but if you can properly mark the hit zones before the needle reaches its end, you'll receive a successful hit for every zone you nailed.   Missing hit zones can be catastrophic, as not only will it use up your actions for that turn, but also you won't be able to move again until your next one. If you can successfully mark the first hit zone, however, you will get at least one successful attack -- but since the game is so heavily reliant on chaining moves, it's not going to do the damage that a single attack in other RPGS normally would.    What's particularly cool, though, is that you can actually customize your Judgment Ring so that you can dictate how big your hit zones are, what special attacks you may have, and how many strikes per turn you can pull off. The rub here is that if you upgrade your Judgment Ring too much, it can be difficult to control. And while you'll have the potential to do more damage than anyone else, you'll also have a bigger shot at messing up.   Additional strategic elements come into the play with the Judgment Ring battle system as well. Special damage modifiers, known as Strike Areas will maximize the amount of damage or the quality of a magic spell if you hit it. Represented by a small red sliver at the end of each hit zone, it's meant to reward players who make the effort to perfect their timing. Additionally, users can also fall victim to special Judgment Ring ailments that can make their wheel move too faster, at random, shrink, and so forth, so there are any number of possible factors to consider when fighting. Plus, you can even forego one character's attack and team them up with another character to create party combination attacks for additional damage. The end result is a combat engine that's so deep that it feels like a strategy game, with a pace that makes it feel real-time rather than turn-based.   Another great aspect of Covenant is the fact that every character is different -- with no two attacks or techniques being the same. Yuri, for example, can slowly earn new transformations powers by collecting the souls of fallen enemies and using them to power up six different elements. Karin will earn special musical sheets that can teach her brand new fencing techniques (yeah it doesn't make sense to me either, but go with it), and Gepetto collects photos of naked bodybuilders to earn new dresses for his puppet (no I'm not kidding). Regardless of what kind of attacks you have at your disposal, however, they're completely unique on a person-by-person basis, and have further sub-types within their categories (juggles, knockdowns, hard hits, etc).    Furthermore, the game's bonus system rewards players for fighting well by providing money, experience, and soul add-ons for users that can complete around without taking damage, by hitting all the strike zones with each character, and other such things. And if you don't want to deal with the challenge of trying to successfully nail the Judgment Ring, you can even decide what kind of ring you want to use -- be it the default, and advanced version, a random one, or a simplistic facsimile that does everything for you. Even better is that each one of them has their own benefits and drawbacks and adds another layer of strategy to the Covenant's depth.   No game is perfect, though, and the same rings true for Shadow Hearts: Covenant. Luckily, my problems with the game are rather nitpicky and don't really take away much from the experience at all. The game's first disc, for example, is pretty linear and is easier to battle with than it is difficult. Of course, by the time things are wrapping up, the game is far more open, with additional sidequests, weapon hunts, hidden dungeons, and the like. I do wish that the towns were a little bit bigger, though, and not so confined, but it's really more of a personal preference than anything, and at this point, I'm just splitting hairs.   It should be noted, though, that fans of more open-ended, industrial-size RPGs may find Shadow Hearts a little on the small side (I didn't, but that's because I spent so much time looking for fights I went way beyond the expected 30-40 hours needed to complete the game), and that enemy encounters need to be actively pursued if you want to do the level up dance. If that's not your cup of tea, though, then the story-heavy pacing and point-by-point overworld map (ala Final Fantasy X) should be perfect for you.So what have we learned from our enthusiastic multi-page excursion today? Well for one, Shadow Hearts: Covenant is literally the perfect sequel. Much deeper than most other turn-based RPGs and neck and neck with Shin Megami Tensei in the race for the year's best storyline, it already has the ingredients needed for a proper role-playing follow-up. But more importantly, Shadow Hearts 2 can stand on its own two feet as a great game regardless of where its roots lie. As players who never fought their way through Koudelka or the first Shadow Hearts don't even have to worry about it -- because Covenant is just that good. Whether any of you were around to experience its background story or not.But what more positive can I say about Shadow Hearts: Covenant other than what I've said already? No matter how you cut it, it deserves to be in every role-playing fan's personal library, and deserves even more another sequel. Simply put: the battle system is great, the characters are awesome, the storyline is among the best of the year, and the presentation is top-notch. And unless anything drastic happens in the next few months, it's easily my favorite of the year and one of the best genre surprises I've had in quite some time.", "date": "Sep 24, 2004"}
