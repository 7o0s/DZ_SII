{"name": "Suikoden 5", "name_review": "Suikoden V", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/22/suikoden-v", "text": "Even for longtime fans of the series, the initial chapters of Suikoden V will test your patience... it certainly tested mine. Unhurried in every sense of the word, the first six to eight hours of the game are surprisingly slow-going in regards to pacing, depth of gameplay (the early bits are almost exclusively exploration and backtracking, with plenty of foundation-laying to go along with it), and what appears to be your typical ~kingdom in strife~ -type storyline. Judged solely on this beginning, it's certainly hard to imagine that Suikoden V would ever become anything special, seemingly falling off into the same doldrums that most other RPGs have suffered from in the past several months.But it would be a major mistake to retain that assumption.You see, regardless of its meager beginnings, Suikoden V is in all truth, a surprisingly impressive return to the franchise's roots. Six member combat parties, huge battlefield skirmishes, and deep characterization and plot are the emphasis in Suikoden once again -- you just have to be willing to put up with a snail-like commencement in order to get to it. Expect a long multi-hour upsurge in the beginning. Despite this terribly long build-up, the narrative here is ultimately the strongest it has ever been, and it trumps every other aspect of the game. Easily on par with the excellent Suikoden II, the plot is one hell of a rollercoaster ride once it gets going and it does a fantastic job of bringing some surprising twists to the table. Though it's no big secret that the Suikoden series has always been healthy with its themes of friendship, betrayal, and corruption, the way in which Konami sets everything up this time is handled very, very well. In short, you won't see the majority of Suikoden V's surprise moments coming at all -- even if you think you've got it figured out early on. For an RPG with such a long lineage and heavy competition, that's a rather notable achievement.Of course, the reason that the storyline works so well is because the cast of characters have actual personalities and behaviors that almost make them real. For every  clichd ~ladies man~ or ~silent warrior~ you run into, two more atypical figures follow suit. That's what makes meeting new people in Suikoden V such a joy. Innocent, well-meaning women aren't necessarily as pure as they'd have you believe, while free-spirited 30-something sexpots aren't the ~all boobs, no brains,~ types you'd expect. Konami's writers have definitely gone against the grain with this one, and it's highly appreciated. Make it out of Stormfist and the game finally starts to get interesting. But like I mentioned earlier, you have to be willing to put up with an enormous amount of preamble in order to discover all this. Hitting up your first deep dungeon doesn't really happen until the hours are well into the teens on your progress clock, and that truly makes it difficult to stick around for the good parts. Hang in there long enough, though, and eventually, it ALL becomes ~the good parts.~    Sadly, this test of endurance plays a big role in Suikoden V's big tragedy. With a story and characters as strong as this game has, it could have been something truly phenomenal. After all, role-playing plotlines seem to be carbon copies of each other these days, with payoffs that are rarely worth the 40 to 60 hours you put into them. Suikoden doesn't have that problem at all obviously, but instead suffers from a number of questionable design choices that keep it from ranking among the PlayStation 2's RPG greats.Luckily Suikoden V's list of disappointments is nothing too derogatory. Instead, the game's big enemy is that apart from its excellent narrative, it runs into several nagging issues in multiple categories. These hitches range anywhere from small (no progressive scan support, despite the fact that the last two titles included it) to large (the first 30-40% of the game provides almost no challenge or need for strategy). Perhaps the most obvious problem, though, is that there's a ton of loading everywhere you turn. Moving from one area to another means 2-5 second loads; initiating a battle means 7-10 second loads; winning a skirmish brings 4-6 second loads afterwards. When you consider how often you'll be fighting and / or exploring your surroundings, this extra wait can definitely get bothersome. Environments are big... very big. Another noticeable problem is that sometimes, Suikoden V is too big for its own good. Towns, castles, and other areas are absolutely enormous and it can take as long as 45 minutes to explore each of them thoroughly (and that's not even counting dungeons). This is all fine and good in theory, but a lot of that extra space goes unused, and it makes me wonder why there was a need to make the environments so massive if they don't serve a purpose (other than scale). This added size can also result in occasional framerate issues as well, and in areas with tall structures, the fixed isometric camera can prove irritating.Clearly Suikoden V isn't the complete package by any means, but in spite of all my qualms, it still manages to do plenty of things right that makes it a lot of fun to play. To start, the returning six-member parties of Suikoden I & II make the 108 Stars of Destiny a lot more useful than the three-person teams of more recent installments. Players can now incorporate various kinds of formations during combat too, and they'll allow you to enjoy special benefits (like Attack +2, Defensive bonuses, etc) if you use them. As an added plus, the formations even allow characters that were previously incompatible in other games (like six short-range fighters) the ability to work together all at once. It's a cool strategic inclusion to be sure. The refined battle system is fun, if not simple. The good news is that the use of these formations and the return of the six-member team doesn't come with any penalties -- you can still learn skills (that sadly, can only be equipped two at a time), can still equip runes for various magical powers, and can still select from a plethora of equipment and items to customize your characters with. Suikoden V also has all the usual extras associated with the franchise as well, including Fortress Building, window and sound sets, character investigations, and more.    Two other nice additions to Suikoden V are improvements to the Duel and Army Battle sequences. The one-on-one confrontations have only been slightly altered yes, but a time limit given between actions adds a much needed sense of urgency to combat. Having different animations and reactions depending on your opponent is a nice touch, and the interface is a lot more intuitive to boot. In other words, the Duel's overall presentation is much better than that of Suikoden IV.But it's the large-scale warfare that's really different. Executed in real-time, the major battles are a sight to behold. Almost a dozen brigades of varying unit types can be controlled by the player at one time (with six categories, including combat ships, archers, and Calvary). These sequences look pretty cool to say the least and, while the strategy isn't as deep as implied, it's still a solid diversion between smaller-scale battles. One-on-one duels are seriously badass. Oh and before I forget, I'm also a big fan of Suikoden V's soundtrack. Though I still prefer the earlier games in terms of overall quality, there are still several very memorable tunes in here and the track selection is definitely varied. Unfortunately, I can't say that I like the voice acting quite as much, but it gets the job done and does compliment the game's theme rather nicely.Because of its incredibly slow start and lesser graphics, I can't see casual RPG fans choosing Suikoden V over the flashier, but less-interesting Square Enix stuff out there. But for role-playing fans that are willing to pay their dues over the course of several hours while putting up with some admittedly irksome design problems, Suikoden V offers more than you'd first think. The storyline and level of characterization definitely saves the whole package, while the search for 108 Stars of Destiny, assorted mini-games, and return to old-school combat isn't without its fun. Still, I can't help but think that with a little more tightening it could have been something truly special.", "date": "Mar 22, 2006"}
