If you have no friends or computer, then this may very well be the game for you.    For the single-player game and Xbox Live, the options are standard hearts. You can play team hearts or traditional winner-take-all. You can toggle the Jack of Diamonds to be normal or worth 10 points. You can play spot hearts, where each heart is worth its face-value in points, and so on and so forth.    Spend your money on a pack of real cards and a 40. For 400 Microsoft points, you can download the hearts game straight to your 360 hard drive, and you will immediately learn that the presentation is the same in all of the Hardwood titles. Hardwood Hearts, Hardwood Backgammon and Hardwood Spades each have the same music and backgrounds. Is that bad? Well, if, for some unholy reason you don't have a deck of cards or backgammon board of your own and download more than one of these titles, then the tunes and backgrounds will be boring, yes. One interesting touch is ~foons,~ which are graphical fireballs or kisses you can send at other players after they drop the Biatch or do you a favor. In the end, though, they are about as exciting as playing a game of hearts by yourself against a computer.   The best hearts game on a console... ever! So, if you're addicted to gamerpoints and achievements, don't have a deck of cards, friends, or a computer to download a free version, than Hardwood Hearts is the perfect addition to your Xbox Live Arcade library.", "date": "Feb 22, 2006"}
