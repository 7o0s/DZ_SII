Publisher Superscape's AMF series is a contender for the money train and at first glance, AMF Bowling Deluxe 3D look like a major winner. The game is sporting some fantastic 3D visuals, great texture work, and a lot of in-game content including online multiplayer.   But the entire experience is hampered by one fatal design flaw -- in the single-player game, you are always forced to watch the full animation of the computer-controlled player. You cannot skip it, something I confirmed with Superscape before writing this review, because I knew it would affect the score. Having to watch the computer animations over and over is a monster waste of time, a problem exacerbated by the very nature of mobile. These animations should be skippable -- just show the computer's score.   Ok. Now that's out of the way.   There quite a bit in AMF Bowling Deluxe 3D that I liked -- and you will, too. The graphics are excellent, from the reflections of the alley lights off the ball to the great player models. There are several play modes, from a quick game to a career mode that shuttles you into tournaments. The prizes for winning the tournaments are extra alleys and new players, each with their own personalities and skill levels. And, as mentioned, there is the online multiplayer.   The bowling mechanics are sound. After lining up with the pins and selecting your angle, you get ready to roll. Instead of working with static meters, you instead hit the action button in time with your bowler's animation. After your bowler starts the throw, you must hit the button just as the bowler's arm reaches the top of the swing. If you let it go too far, you'll step over the line. If you hit it too early, you'll roll the ball with little oomph. Once the ball is in motion, you can coax it in a specific direction by tapping the directional pad or 6/8 keys. Depending on your player's skill level, you can really rack up some strikes with the proper nudging.   Outside of my major issue with the amount of wasted time in AMF, I enjoyed this game. Bowling is such a perfect fit for mobile and the dynamics of replacing boring meters with the player animation is a great step forward. The quick game mode will satisfy a lot of players that just like to dink around with bowling, but the career offers a lot of value if you really dig in and start unlocking content.It sounds harsh to ding a game for something like un-skippable animations, but if you play AMF Bowling and find yourself forced to waste precious stolen mobile moments watch the same animations over and over, you'll understand my frustration. Otherwise, this is a good bowling game with solid mechanics. The visuals are indeed fantastic, but for once I confess I got tired of looking at them. Just let me bowl!", "date": "Aug 13, 2007"}
