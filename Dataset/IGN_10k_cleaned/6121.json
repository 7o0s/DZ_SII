The Jet Moto and Twisted Metal series (and Warhawk, though it wasn't really a racing game, per say) were fresh ideas in their time and reeked hard-core sensibilities.   Well, that's all over now. It's three years later, and the PlayStation has more than enough action, hard-core racing and combat titles to skin a chicken. We're here to unfortunately tell you that Streak is more of the same Jet Moto, in a slightly different package and with a new name.  Based on gamers' abilities to command anti-gravity hoverboards, Streak lines up a rough-looking set of alternative-lifestyle dudes and chicks who race through a dozen of so levels (including Barnum's Alley, Agua Escondido, and Windway Park among others), pulling off tricks and stunts while trying to place first. Streak doesn't play like a skateboarding game, and it doesn't play like Psygnosis' Psybadek, either. Rather, it's like a weird hybrid of Jet Moto, with a remarkably similar set of physics and abilities. You have more flexibility in your movements, and can achieve faster speeds when you pull off stunts, two nice new qualities in Streak. The standard race leads you through a series of courses linearly organized, and more difficult to beat as you progress through them.   Streak also includes a smart Freestyle mode, which is specifically set up for option-heads and stunt maniacs. You can pick from a list of courses, a list of scoring methods (such as timed, timed stunts, and stunt goals), a quantity of laps, and you can select human vs. computer controlled competitors.   Multiplayer fans will like this because it's both single and two-player, with options to vie across a link cable (pending your ownership of two PSXs, two copies of Streak, etc.), and that  along with the stunts  is where the fun really comes in.   Streak is a rather simple racing game that will take some people a while to learn, because the courses are loaded with snake-like twists and turns, but a handy training mode will get any stragglers into the swing of things. More often than not, the courses are too overly designed and prompt slower speeds, more control, and ironically, less abandon.   The game boasts a solid frame rate and a dazzling set of flashing lights and lighting effects, and the overall look is considerably more polished than Jet Moto 2. Musically, the game is a mix of electronica-inspired tunes, and fast-moving disco-style songs that are perfect for the ride. Singletrack implemented a nice set of audio touches that concur with your selections through the menus.  Streak is analog and dual shock compatible.  Streak is more of the same, and yet it's not. After looking at this game for about three seconds and forming an instant opinion, I decided to give it the ~Doug Test.~ I played through it for hours afterward to give it the most honest review possible, and I must say that Streak is a fast, aerial remake of Jet Moto. Period. I played it even after I didn't want to anymore and attempted different things that might make the game more interesting.I disagree with my cohort Mr. Nelson that the frame rate and sound are miserable. Neither is bad. The sense of speed is quite nice actually, and you increase your speed after pulling off flips, stunts, and other cool tricks. That's clearly the big incentive here, and since you're on a hoverboard, the sense of free 3D movement is, occasionally, delectable. But in the fourth year of PlayStation games, Streak looks and feels like old hat. And those who liked Jet Moto won't like this because it's not like Jet Moto, and those who like skateboarding games won't like it because it's not a true skateboarder. (See Street Sk8er for that.) That double-edged cross-genre creativity used to be the kind of attribute that magnetized gamers toward Singletrack's games, but in this case, it's clearly working against the company. Streak is a fast-moving aerial hoverboard game, and it's better than the slightly comparable Psybadek, but Streak isn't even a flash in the pan.", "date": "Dec 9, 1998"}
