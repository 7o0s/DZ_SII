He raided. He plundered. He raped. He pillaged. Hesang and danced?    Believe it or not, it's true. The long held image of sweaty, hard-bitten soldiers with swords drawn and fire in their eyes is actually only half the Viking story. Most of the time they were farmers, and when they weren't terrorizing other people or stealing their sheep they sat around campfires telling stories and worrying about their crops. Sometimes they would even pick up their feet and dance to the sound of pipes, fiddles, and drums. And though the infamous warrior-farmers have now faded into the mists of time, their music lives on, and in the most unlikely of places: a video game called Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria.   Silmeria is the prequel to Valkyrie Profile, a Playstation game which grabbed quite a cult following some years ago. Both VP and VP2 revolve around valkyrie, warrior maidens sent to Earth by the king of the gods Odin to collect the souls of the dead and train them for Ragnarok, the Scandinavian version of Armageddon. The twin plots come directly from Norse mythology, and everything from names of people to names of towns reflect that. It's therefore no surprise that the music follows suit.   Readers be warned: Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria OTS Volume 1 is not a rocking, fast-paced musical rampage.  Fans expecting the usual high-energy techno and electronica-inspired pieces by Motoi Sakuraba may be a put off by the soft, lilting melodies of this game. Don't be. The music is understated and gossamer on purpose, allowing gamers to enjoy both the music and great sound effects that make up this inspired sequel. Dungeon themes are always dark and lurking, but never pretentious. Town themes are light and breezy, if tinged with melancholy. Even the background music for movie sequences is unobtrusive, setting the mood but not ruining it. In fact, much of the soundtrack is so easy-going the tunes could substitute as soothing background noise at work.    That's not to say that the score isn't flawed.  Norwegian music tends to be a bit repetitive at times, and some tracks fall into this bog. ~The Blossom Out For You~ track sounds a bit like ~Alms For The Small One,~ while ~Purse The Awful Mystery~ resembles~ Raid the Mighty.~ But the composer tries his best to make up for it with a few twists: he uses a dash of spicy percussions, then mixes in some contemporary instruments such as the electric guitar and synthesizer to change things up. And nobody can accuse him of not doing his research: all the songs are heavily influenced by musical instruments native to Scandinavia such as the Langeleik and the Seljefjyte (a willow flute).    Once fans get used to the rather unorthodox music style, they can enjoy many of the tracks. The battle song ~A Motion of Finishing Blow~ is well-paced, with dramatic strings and the echo of brass horns, while ~Overture To The Destiny~ is dramatic and haunting. There's even a couple of head-bangers, such as ~Junk Modulation.~ If Eric the Red were alive today, he might be impressed by these hip remakes on all his old faves. That is, if he wasn't too busy plundering IGN's game lockers and playing Gears of War.    Definitely Download:  1. ~Junk Modulation~  2. ~A Motion of Finishing Blow~  3. ~Raid The Might Force~  4. ~Sank Memories~  5. ~Celestial Troupe~", "date": "Nov 4, 2006"}
