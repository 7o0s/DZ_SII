{"name": "Kya: Dark Lineage", "name_review": "Kya: Dark Lineage", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/20/kya-dark-lineage", "text": "Known for its respectable work on the V-Rally series, Eden Studios' first action-adventure title, Kya: Dark Lineage, is no doubt a major break from powerslides, finely tuned engines and rugged Grecian terrain. Modeled on Nintendo's long-lasting action-adventure series, The Legend of Zelda, Kya brings PS2 gamers a hybrid experience featuring equal amounts of platforming, combat, exploration and story-telling to the fold.   Eden's story of a brother and sister thrown into a different dimension is handled well in many respects, especially because there are dozens of good ideas implemented here over a large, impressive set of landscapes. In other respects, such as voice acting and tuning, it tends to fall apart. And despite some of the story's naivet, the Sid and Marty Kroft sensibilities and a mixture of both original and me-too design, Kya is a reputable first attempt at blending several different genres into one original story, and it's a solid game on its own.   Gameplay  Kya: Dark Lineage tells the story of a precautious teenage girl, Kya, and her brother who discover, one late night in a secret basement in their parentless home, a dimensional portal. Naturally, they're both sucked into it almost before they know what hit them. Gamers quickly learn that Kya's long-lost father was at work on similar devices (after all, it was his hidden workroom they discovered), and that he has something to do with this brave new technicolor world of strange cat-like animals (Nativs) and their evil enemies (Wolfens).   After listening to some of the hokiest set of conversations ever - from huge-faced humanoid cats, no less -featuring several laugh-out-loud awful voice-over scenes, players take on the role of Kya, a nimble platform character who gains dozens of item, combat powers, tools and weapons to help her newfound feline friends.   Structured very much on The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (or, if you prefer, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker), Kya both succeeds and fails in mimicking and re-interpreting Nintendo's famous franchise. The story is told with a whimsical sensibility, and it's backed up with a lush, wildly colorful Eden-like world. It's realized over the course of nine massive, multilevel landscapes cobbled together with vertical wind tunnels and slip-'n-slide chutes (which Kya rides across using her invisible chuteboard).    Even though the narrative basically tells the story of a despondent yet heroic child who tries to save her brother from an evil leader, it's very much a tale of redemption and bringing a family back together. In that, Eden wades into territory that it's clearly new to. Some parts are cute and charming, while others just seem cheesy. But Kya is cool...at least cool enough to adhere to in the beginning. And with her vast set of abilities, along with the constantly opening set of levels, players can often overlook the kiddy family story as the gradually unveiled worlds open up new challenges.   For example, players tromp through the first verdant village, in which they learn they can buy items at shops or play mini-games. These look and function just like those in Wind Waker; and there's even a weirdo merchant with a wacky voice there to humor you. (Though thankfully, he doesn't scratch his balls as in Nintendo's game.) The villages are set across multiple hills and canyons and, though the convoluted map and myriad set of levels is confusing at first, as players learn progress past the various challenges, they'll learn enough new skills to pass that early learning curve, hopefully with smiles on their faces. I, for one, wasn't convinced within the first few hours. But as I progressed, Kya's strange charm grew on me.     As part of the game's currency system, players earn cash to buy items. They beat up enemies, destroy crates (gotta have crates!) and the like to acquire the loot. Cash can then be used to buy combat upgrades, such as new bracelets (which represent new moves), boomys (her boomerang) and bombs, just to name a few. The mini-games give players the un-ending option of betting or risking that money in the hopes of making more.     Though the game is pretty balanced when it comes to collecting (in other words, it's not a collect-a-thon), the most interesting collection aspect has to do with exorcising Wolfens. Kya needs to collect energy spheres (strategically placed throughout the worlds), which are part of the world's innate magic system. Because she's human and part of this chosen family, she can collect the spheres which she can then ~spend~ on defeated Wolfens. You see, Wolfens are actually magically altered Nativs, so when Kya exorcizes them, the return to their native form. The bigger the enemy, the more spheres it takes to convert them.   What's really cool about this idea is that as you defeat and convert more Wolfens, the newly freed Nativs return to the Nativ territory and begin building new villages. The new villages mean newly opened up shops, which have more items and weapons to buy, and the more combat skills you can purchase.   The whole thing works nearly flawlessly. But I constantly had problems getting to the right place, and the way in which the different levels of each world were organized was confusing and frustrating. Some levels can only be located by ridiculously convolute means, whether it's by using the slider board or by falling into them. Also, the wind/tunnel system, while imaginative and new, isn't as clear as it could be. None of the levels are named, they're instead indicated by a graphic stillshot. It's a right brain-left brain thing, I know, but if you don't play this game for a while and then come back to it, you're just plain lost.    You could argue that the non-linear, organic system is unique and different, and I won't argue there. But it's equally confusing and, given the vertical structure and vastness of each one with sidequests and a map that's just a little too crowded, it's too perplexing for my tastes. There are too many times in where I wished I could just walk into an area, instead of futilely searching for the opening.    I am impressed with the arcade-style combat system. Kya can earn up to as many as 30 attacks, plus combos and magical strikes. Once you get past the initial set of thug Wolfens, they start to learn your moves. Eden programmed these guys to recognize the repetitive attacks, a system which prevents boring button mashing fights. Players must mix up their hits and kicks, throwing in combos and move around an area to get the best angle on an enemy. The purposefully slowed-down cinematics are a bit overdone at this point (as so many other games have done it), but they do give us a little bit of an aesthetic reward for winning a hard-fought battle.    There are tons of little things that make Kya stand out as a unique entity in the action-adventure realm. For instance, the wind tunnels and freefalls, though done before dating back to Earthworm Jim, are still more complicated than any other similar game. There are these little squishy creatures everywhere, some cute, some evil, but either way, the world is populated with them. And Eden's insistence on creating a viable living world with its own ecosystem, etc., should be acknowledged. Plus, the little Pokemon-looking creatures that you jump on and kick? Hell, they're a little mini-game all on their own. Way fun. And, lest I forget, the platform elements are smart. Penetrating one of the bigger Wolfen forts successfully for the first time was an exhilarating experience -- Very rewarding.     If the game has any faults, and I won't go into the navigation issue again, it's in its attempt to mimic Zelda and many other games in the genre too closely. If you're going to make a game of this nature, then Zelda is the game to copy. No argument there. But at the same time it's got a solid combat system and beautiful lush worlds, it's as if Eden took the Zelda blueprint and Frenchified it in the most stereotypical way. In many ways, we've seen everything here before. It's a magical lush world (not unlike that of Rayman's), filled with mini-games and shops (Zelda), it's in a parallel universe of strange creatures and weird evil mechanic baddies (Heart of Darkness), the leader of which happens to be Kya's dad (hey! Even a Star Wars reference), and the baddy creatures are actually good creatures under an evil influence (Sonic the Hedgehog and Rayman). I'm also constantly reminded of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for some reason. So, while many ideas have been incorporated well in this massive game, many of these heavily re-hashed were done better in other games.    Graphics  If you haven't already seen Ubisoft's Rayman series, then the very first time you see Kya should be a thrill. Certainly, it would be awesome. Heck, even if you have seen Rayman before, Kya is pretty spectacular. The lush floating worlds and the fantastic draw distances give players the feeling that they are definitely in an alternate dimension.    Each of the nine levels floats in its chunk of the sky, each with its own individual geography. I particularly liked the tube-like swirling level, Hunter's Domain, in which players jump on a Jamgut (a cross between a camel and a kangaroo) to get from point A to point B. The texture work is relatively average but the amount of creative work in the level's overall design makes up any other shortcomings. And, it must be said, these levels are very large indeed.    The Native and human character design is generic. The Nativs just look silly; like skinny-legged stuffed cats with huge, wide faces. I'm just not sure what to make of them -- to laugh out loud every time I see one, or to wonder at their weird movements and goofy conversations. The Wolfens are a little cooler. They go through humorous animations and have a likeable shaggy, thuggish appearance.    Gamers with the right TVs can watch this game in 16X9 widescreen if they so choose.    Sound  As I mentioned in the early part of the review, the dialog and the voice-acting of the Nativs is downright laughable. I'm not very picky when it comes to this kind of thing, either, but when I started uncontrollably chuckling at the way these characters talked, I knew something was amiss. In many ways, Kya acts like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon, talking down to its audience, instead of being smartly, wittily written. Kya, her brother and the dialogue of the Wolfen clan is enjoyable.    Kya supports Dolby Surround Sound for those with the right systems.Kya is a good solid game, one that's deep with a huge variety of things to do, be it fighting, solving physical puzzles, collecting stuff, wandering around in a vegetative daze or leaf-surfing. While Eden's ambitious action-adventure game tries its best to be different than the many other games in this category -- and, to a degree, it succeeds -- the glut of all too familiar gameplay schemes and design structures aren't done quite as well as in other games. And its mostly corny story, hilarious (as in hilarious to laugh at, not with) voice-acting and dopey dialog drain the life out of the otherwise interesting set of challenges. Kya is in a tough spot. From this journalist's eyes, it's one of those games that, as an overall package, is pretty darn good. There are so many little cool things -- be they likeable creatures, fun challenges (like using the Jamgut to hop onto a moving cargo car, or sneaking into Wolfen factories), or opening up a new location. And yet, there are so many weak areas, too -- like the mediocre surfing portions, or the frustrating to navigate areas, or unevenly polish locales (several sections are missing collision detection, so Kya and enemies fall through or sink into solid objects). It's worth a rent at the very least, and perhaps, if you're in the mood, you should even buy it.", "date": "Nov 20, 2003"}
