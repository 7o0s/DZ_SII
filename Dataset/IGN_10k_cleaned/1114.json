To the gentleman who wrote into Q&A the other day asking all the different questions about game localization, this is another one of those things that only makes sense in the minds of marketing experts.  For whatever reason, it's forbidden for any American videogame to carry a title as cool as ~Dewprism.~  'Scuse me, just one of those hot buttons of mine.  It's not a very appropriate way to kick things off here, though, because regardless of what anyone chooses to call it (I'll call it Threads of Fate for clarity's sake, but I won't like it), Threads of Fate is quite a fine game, a well-made action-RPG with a great personality, clean visual execution, an engaging smorgasbord of gameplay elements, and a pair of tandem plots that will definitely bring you back for a second time through the adventure.  It doesn't have the depth of some of Square's bigger titles this year, like Chrono Cross or Vagrant Story, and it's nowhere close to Nintendo's Legend of Zelda, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't get your money's worth of fun out of it.  Threads of Fate is the lineal descendent of Brave Fencer Musashi, Square's first attempt at a fully 3D action-RPG.  It worked pretty well, most agreed.  It had depth, solid control, a nicely kinked personality, and an interesting system of evolving skills - Musashi, you may recall, could acquire all kinds of different special abilities from the many monsters he defeated.  Threads takes most of Musashi's ideas, as well as its visual style, and moves them a rung or two up the evolutionary ladder.  Or perhaps you could say ladders, plural.  Atop a basic foundation of 2D and 3D action and platforming elements - the game is all realtime 3D, but few of the levels go very far beyond a side-scrolling or otherwise linear structure - there are two very different systems of magic and skills.  When you begin Threads of Fate, you choose one of two lead characters: the mysterious shapeshifter Rue, or the brash young princess Mint.  Which one you pick shapes the entire game, both the events you encounter and how you make your way through them.  Both characters handle the same in the game's simple 3D hand-to-hand combat sequences, but the other powers they possess are very different.  Mint's chief weapon is her arsenal of spells - she may have been kicked out of her home kingdom on account of her dangerously narcissistic attitude, but not before she picked up some impressive magical ability.  Rue, on the other hand, can transform into monsters and use their innate powers in addition to his own.    These two systems are very different, making Threads of Fate very close to two games in one.  Mint's magic system actually reminds me a fair bit of Secret of Mana, if you can believe it.  She has a ring of eight elemental magic disciplines, each with several different spells.  Using the ring menu, which you bring up with the square button, you select one active spell at any given point, which you can then activate at will with the triangle button so long as you have the requisite amount of magic points.  If you want to switch to another spell, it's easy to quickly swap out your current one.  You mainly use spells to supplement your hand-to-hand combat abilities, but in another echo from Seiken Densetsu, you occasionally have to use them to solve puzzles or throw switches.  For example, in one area, a windmill powers an elevator that you need to ride to your destination.  The solution: power up your Green magic, which harnesses the wind and sets the propellor to spinning.  Red fire magic burns through chunks of ice, blue water magic puts out dangerous blazes, explosive black magic destroys boulders that block your path.    Rue collects a similarly wide array of abilities, but his progression is a little steadier, and his acquisitions a little more unconventional.  Part of his quest is simply to discover what he is, because he possesses the ability to transform into the many monsters he encounters.  The first time Rue defeats a new monster, he collects a Monster Coin, which allows him to take on the form of that monster at will.  Kill a Pollywog, and you can wiggle around the forest biting things; kill a Porcupine, and you can fit into small spaces and spike people; kill a Fire Blob and you can ooze around setting fires.  Like Mint's spells, his transformations are handy for both combat and puzzle-solving.  One example of this also illustrates how the two quests occasionally mirror each other.  Early on, you encounter a relief in a clearing that reads ~Face...Gargoyle.~  In Mint's quest, I recall, it just means you have to fight off several Gargoyles.  Rue, on the other hand, simply has to become a Gargoyle himself, and sit in the center of the clearing opposite the Gargoyle statue there.  In either case, a staircase appears to take you up to the next area.  The two quests run on parallel tracks like that at times, but they also have long stretches that are unique to that character's story.  They're also set apart by their different general character.  Mint is loud, lighthearted, and irrepressible, completely up front about her desire for total world domination (and yes, she's one of the heroes).  Thus, her story never gets too serious, although it has a few nicely touching moments.  Rue's story is rather somber in contrast - he's on a quest to find both his lost love and his own identity, and so the bright world around him grows a little calmer and darker than it does during Mint's adventure.  Threads of Fate always remains a basically cheerful affair, though.  That's one of its strongest assets: this game has charm, and plenty of it.  It's bright, friendly, colorful, welcoming - there's a fellow in a big puffy star suit running around, for goodness' sake, and he's one of the bad guys, at least for a little while.  The script, visuals, and sound (the soundtrack isn't one of Square's epic scores, but there are some offbeat tunes that suit the game nicely) come together to create a wonderful personality for the game.  The character design deserves special congratulations, both the artistic concepts themselves and the way they're realized in 3D.  Both are a step up from Brave Fencer in terms of the amount of detail and the precision of their rendering - the character models are detailed, expressive, and show very few collision detection errors, despite all the different animations (limbs, faces, weapons, clothing) and many closeups during realtime cinema sequences (of which there are a great many).  Many of Brave Fencer's mainly Gouraud-shaded polygons have been upgraded to texture maps, adding a new level of detail to characters like the Doll Master.  The worlds and backgrounds are often not all that impressive, especially in comparison to the 3D realms of Vagrant Story and Metal Gear Solid, but the characters hold your focus well enough on their own.  There are some very nice monster designs as well, from the nippy little Pollywogs to gigantic supernatural bosses.  And yes, I just said ~script~ up there.  One of the most pleasant refrains of this year continues onward: Square is producing translations I can read again.  Threads of Fate is frequently quite funny - not laugh-out-loud funny, but warm smile sort of funny.  The text has a witty edge when it wants to, although it's capable of being serious when it needs to, during the deeper scenes and sub-plots - I very much liked Prima Doll's brief bouts of soul-searching amid the light tone of Mint's story.  Prominent characters have their own voices, to a degree, and their dialogue is always authentic.  The odd American cultural reference doesn't ring harshly at all; in fact, I got a kick out of the running Pinto gag (play the game, you'll see).  Threads of Fate isn't an extremely deep game.  Neither it nor Legend of Mana are the successor to Secret of Mana that many action-RPG fans have been hoping for this year.  It's fairly easy, especially due to the forgiving continue system - you gather coins throughout your quest that let you restart very near where you died, and I never ran low at any time.  It takes place in a relatively small world, centered around the single town of Carona.  There's no overworld map to explore between dungeon crawls, not near as much of that epic globe-trotting feel, and each quest isn't unusually long.  They run about ten or twelve hours apiece, with a lot of in-game cinematics separating each episode.    But that's a solid twenty hours there, since you'll certainly want to play both quests, and in my opinion, the game's many finer qualities make Threads of Fate worth the purchase.  The game does pack a challenge, with some tough bosses and genuinely difficult Klonoa-esque platforming sequences, and the magic systems are fun to explore and develop, with a lot of different spells and transformations to acquire.  There's actually some nonlinear exploration involved with that, because you won't collect anywhere near the full complement of magic by simply blazing through the game.  Some dungeons and areas have sections that you'll have to revisit in order to collect additional spells.  Chalk up another hit for Square, then.  Threads of Fate isn't the grand slam that Vagrant Story was or Chrono Cross will be, but I'd call it a solid run-scoring double (sorry, with the Mariners in playoff contention I've got baseball on the brain).  It's not an unequivocally recommended purchase, but if buying it doesn't stop you from trying one of this summer's triple-A titles, like Chrono Cross, I doubt you'll regret it.  Its unique gameplay elements give it enough depth to compete, and its personality is definitely a winner.  It's also pleasing to note that this would be a great title for the younger set.  I say this without a hint of condescension - it's bright and very playable, but still contains challenges for the reflexes and puzzle-solving abilities, and the text strikes a nice balance between being nonoffensive and still having a little bite to it.  So if you can, pick it up, and make sure to finish the second quest before your kid brother steals it.  -- David Smith", "date": "Jul 19, 2000"}
