{"name": "NBA Hoopz", "name_review": "NBA Hoopz", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/02/nba-hoopz", "text": "The long-lasting Midway tradition of bringing goodness from the coin-op to the home continues with each and every console, the latest example is NBA Hoopz, the company's first three-on-three basketball game for consoles.   In Hoopz, players have the chance to play as three of their favorite NBA stars, coupled with all of the great over-the-top fun that featured so heavily in the last million iterations of this game, including NBA Showtime, NBA Hangtime, NBA Jam, etc. Unfortunately, the new formula is exactly the same as the old formula, and the extra third player contributes almost no additional gameplay worth at all. In fact, if you never pass to the third player, your game plays exactly like NBA Showtime, with more confusion down in the key.   The addition of a third player in NBA Hoopz has always sounded like a great idea, especially if that means altering, complementing, or re-charging the formula that was so much fun back in the early 1990s when NBA Jam resounded so warmly with first-time players. But Hoopz plays exactly like Showtime, just with more clutter, along with several problematic aspects that drag the game down ever farther into the mindless Midway mind-shaft mire.  Gameplay Three-on-three hoops: What a great idea, right? After all, street ball being played across the US these days often comprises this very setup, not to mention adult three-on-three contests and championships that are held in every metropolitan area for prizes and money. Yeah well, Midway approached the idea, but somewhere along the way, forgot, misplaced, or burned the documents that read, ~three-on-three basketball is a different game than two-on-two basketball, and the game should reflect this idea.~ Perhaps this piece document didn't even exist, but whether it was lost, thrown out, or never existed doesn't really matter now, because Hoopz is on retail shelves, and it didn't work. The first and most lasting impression that I had, and still have, about this game is that it's simply cluttered two-on-two. With a third, annoying player, who's in the way of the action, and is a simple waste of polygons, the game seems paradoxically vacant, too. Vacant in the way that I was expecting something new or different to happen, but never did.   Examples of why it doesn't work? How many would you like? Let's start with the simple ones. Three-on-three is different than two-on-two because it adds a different physical dynamic to basketball. I never played serious ball in high school, but I played a lot in junior high, started on lots of teams, and have played a lot of pick-up ball all my life. In a three-player game, players can pick and roll more often, and the actual teamwork aspect of the game is enhanced substantially. It's still a simple, fast, showy game, but there are more variables, which throw into the mix a more complex dynamic. There are no pick-and-rolls in Hoopz. There are no screens. There are no play set-ups, there is no difference...at all. There is nothing except three players on screen following NBA Jam routines. Like I said before, it's vacant.   Why add a new player if it doesn't change the game? It sounds good, right? In my first nine games I simply picked the best three-point shooter on the team (in this case, Isaiah Rider of the LA Lakers), found his hot spot on the court, and then using less than 1% of my collective brainpower (and only about 16% of my brain actually works anyway), I ran time and again to the same spot and busted a trey. Snore. Occasionally when the computer AI gets tired of that, I passed inside to Shaq who slams it down. Yawn. Hey -- it's just like playing Showtime! Big frickin' shocker. Wake me up when the game changes...   I tried different things, moving around the court, watching to see if guys would fill the lane, or run a pick, but it's easier to double-tap turbo and dust your own opponent than it is to wait for a screen...that isn't even in the game. OK, so I'm not very impressed with the three-player aspect, because there is no three-player aspect with which to be impressed. On broader scale of things, the game itself plays exactly like any of the former NBA games from Midway, and features the on-fire meter, a team on-fire meter, over-the-top dunks and inside moves, incredible alley-oop shots, fade-away jumpers, mid-air passes, and quick passes. If you have played any of Midway's basketball games before, you'll instantly recognize this one.   The game is essentially still very simple and holds all of the problems that have appeared in all of Midway's other versions. The rebound game is still frustrating (either useless or too controlled by AI), shoves are more difficult to do, partly because it's so hard to see where your player is, but also partly because Eurocom has toned it down, and three-pointers make up about 80% of the game. If you score a lot of tres, so does the opponent. And of course, the AI catch-up is still very apparent and bothersome.   The game has changed so little from its former self that the additions are, strangely enough, hard to spot. The ones I noticed are the six mini-games, 2ball, 21, Around the World, Hoopz School and a few others; the way in which you ~create~ your players, and a few other tweaks. The mini-games are almost entirely useless. To be honest, we sat down and played 2ball and were simply confused at what to do. The other mini-games were OK, as in, they do indeed exist. But see, the idea is useless to start off with. Usually, folks play the game of 21 so that they break up one-on-one games to keep from getting bored. So, is that why these games are here? To keep us from getting bored with the game itself? Or, perhaps they're here for bragging rights. But that's what the Quick Start or Career is for, to slam your opponent time and again in a real game, and brag about it. These mini-games may appear on paper to create variety and some ~lite~ variety for the casual gamer, but in short, they're just fluff, filling, the little S-shaped things that come in a big fragile box, to prevent it the inside item from breaking.   As for the interface, the uber-simple, and often poor, scheme makes gamers wait for one another while picking teams, where it could easily have been set up for two people to choose players and teams at once. In fact, the menu setup in Hangtime was easy, fast, and near-perfect for an arcade game. They could have left most of it alone. The most confusing aspect of the menu system is in the Create-a-Team mode. A simple drag and drop function would have made this perfect.   Another interesting aspect of the game is that while Showtime featured Create-A-Player mode, which I quite liked, this one ditches that so that every player can be reshaped or retooled. Like Create-a-Player, each player in Hoopz has a set of characteristics; you know, strength, 3-point, 2-point, rebounds, speed, steals, dribbles, etc. There is a limit to how many points each can have. But you can allocate points from, say, Allen Iverson's power sum to his 3-pointer sum. It's cool, because by setting up your team, I personalized each player to function, as I wanted. And I made Kobe Bryant a perfect three-point shooter. Fancy that...   Oh, just for the record, I'm not sure how fast this game was rushed out, or how well it was tested, but I had some technical problems with it. This game, the final version, locked up on me at least twice. First when I tried to start my first game in the Career season, and another time when I was just playing. These are not good signs.  Graphics Here's where a game like NBA Hoopz should at least be able to protect itself from evil critics such as myself. After all, I'm looking for the good, the bad, and the ugly, and if there is little good, there always seems to be more bad and ugly. That Wild West formula holds true here.   What really sticks to your face like a wet towel is the absolutely miserable framerate, which is perhaps even worse than in last year's version. It's not only slow for the characters, but the ball slows down while in mid-air for three-pointers. Normally I would day that Midway should be ashamed of this kind of product, but frankly we have seen so many bad ports to PlayStation from Midway that it's merely redundant.   But the framerates take a second place to the unforgivable facial textures. If you really like basketball, you'll notice the player faces. These guys' faces are absolutely mangled. It's like a facial reconstruction team from an insane asylum got ahold of these guys with some jackhammers and went on a circus spree. Poor Marcus Camby, his face took a beating. But then, just about everybody's faces took a beating. If I were any one of these pros, I'd be pissed off!  Sound The sound in this game, compared to Showtime, has dropped down in intensity. The constant in-your-face theme songs have faded into a calm, muzak-style hip-hop that offends no one, because of course, no one really remembers it.   As for sound effects, only a few things are note worthy. The announced is actually worse than before. He's just way off. He says things like, ~He's going for short shot!~ when I hurl the ball from more than half court, and often doesn't say anything at all when I expect him to. And more often than not the big sound of a slam is completely muted by some alien force that is apparently opposed to clanging rims. About 40% of the time, slamming a ball is the quietest thing in the world in Hoopz. Of course, it's a glitch, and you can hear the sound in the replay, if you really want to.  And then there is the occasional, ~Who's your daddy?~ And ~All day long!~ quips, but they're quiet and subtle, not like in a real game, when players walk by and say this in your face quite loudly and smile.Only if you're desperate should you even rent this game. It's a poor port of a game that's not good, and only looks and plays worse on the PlayStation. Don't get it.", "date": "Apr 2, 2001"}
