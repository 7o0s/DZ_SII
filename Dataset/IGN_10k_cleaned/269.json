One even has a pizza joint named after him. They're in everyday life no matter where you look.  And now they're coming to grace Game Boy and Game Boy Color with action gaming just like it should be -- fun!  At first sight, Rats! might appear to be just your typical, boring ~ho-hum~ romp, but its gameplay proves otherwise -- it's pretty damn addicting. Features  5 worlds with 15 levels each 10 bonus levels Password feature For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  A new rodent has arrived on the small screen, and his debut on the handheld just goes to show that Game Boy's got it where it counts.  Take 2 Interactive Software and Tarantula Studios have effectively managed to produce an action title that's both fun on the go or at home, and it's not hard to see why.  Rats! has a multitude of challenging levels to keep you crawling back for more (over 70 in all), even with all the mob bosses hungry to see you bite the big one.  And since you're a rat whose quest is to win back Marlon ~The Godfather~ Mozzarella's daughter, you've got a lot to go up against.  Marlon, who kidnapped his own child, obviously doesn't intend for you to get to her, and he'll throw every mobster at you that he can just to make sure that you won't.  Because it'll be quite some time before you find out where your precious ~Loretta~ is being held captive, not to mention that there are baddies around every corner, you'll need a gun. Good thing you're a rodent with a 'tude, because you just happen to have one, with unlimited ammo to boot!  In each level, you have to navigate your way past enemies and obstacles while keeping your eyes peeled for food.  Once you collect each edible item, the exit to the level will open and you'll be able to move on. Don't waste your time either, because if your hourglass runs out, you'll be followed by a flying henchman whose only intention is to take your life away. And in case control is a major concern, moving your character around couldn't be easier than it is in Rats!  Fire your weapon with B and jump with A -- it's as simple as that.  The graphics, colorful and cartoonish, suit the game perfectly; you won't hear any gripes from me.  Rats! uses the Game Boy Color's enhancements well, and everything fits together nicely from stage to stage and world to world.  The still pictures that appear before each level, when you die, and in other places,  make the best use of the color system's abilities, despite the palette's limitations. Unlike so many other games for Game Boy that I've been able to play, Rats! has music that won't make you wish you were deaf.  The tunes fit the scene perfectly, no matter whether it sounds like you're doing hard time or fighting against a big crime lord.  Every melody included has a familiar feel, and chances are you've heard most of them before at least once in your life. It's addictive, it's fun, and it'll reel you in if you let it.  Rats! is a great game in a portable package, and it's perfect if you need a 2D fix that the flashy next-gen systems can't provide you with.  With replay value that will keep you coming back over and over again, Rats! is another highly-enjoyable action title in the Game Boy's treasure trove of games.", "date": "Sep 30, 1999"}
