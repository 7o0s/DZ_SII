Whether it's Nintendo's return to the Mario universe, or Microsoft's attempt at ingenuity with Blinx, those loveable platform traversing characters are back in style again. And though some of these returns have been met with varying responses, Electronic Arts has taken its own stab at the genre regardless of predisposed opinions. Quirky and personable, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is here!   Centered on one of the last Tasmanian Tigers, the action unfolds as Ty discovers that his family has been trapped in the unearthly Dreamtime Realm. Banished there long ago by a manaical bird creature named Boss Cass, Ty's lineage has been gone for untold years and up until now, had no hope of ever returning to reality. That is, until Ty himself discovered the key to unleashing them -- The Magic Talismans. Scattered throughout the Australian landscape in hidden locations, Ty must uncover these talismans to help his family before Boss Cass finds them instead. Should the evil feathered creature uncover the icons, unimaginable power will be his and the world will never be the same.   Gameplay  Ty the Tasmanian Tiger borrows heavily from the Mario series. Starting in the hub world of Rainbow Cliffs, you can then travel to other lands from specific portals located in different areas of the Cliffs. You can't go everywhere in the beginning and there is a general path to take, but to complete certain levels in their entirety you must gain certain abilities and boomerangs in other areas and then return later.    There are four main portals that are broken down into three levels (the fourth has only two), not including a boss battle. The first three portals levels are composed of a variation of rainforest, fire, snow, and classic beach themes, but they begin to vary later one. Every level has eight goals to complete with three of them always consisting of the same gig: collect 300 opals, find and rescue five caged Bilbies, and complete a timed race of some sort. Finishing these goals will result in a Thunder Egg, which is used to help recover the Talismans, as well as give you new boomerangs.    The other five level goals vary, and require you to figure out what it is you must accomplish, much like in Mario Sunshine. The name of the mission gives you a hint about what you're supposed to do and the map screen will show you a question mark where uncompleted goals are. Figuring out what to do at which location is usually self-explanatory, though some of the some are a little more cryptic. Also, almost every level has some type of objective that involves finding eight objects, whether its lost children buried under the snow, or lighting eight pilot lights for a heater. These missions in particular can be a little frustrating since you the levels are quite large and finding what you want can be chore, but the objects tend to stay in a certain area of the level.    Along with eight Thunder Eggs, there are also golden cogs placed throughout the level that, after collecting fifteen of them, you can use to get new boomerangs. There are twelve boomerangs in all, ranging from the Aquarang (for underwater use) to the Doomarang, which you can guide using remote control. The rangs are used not only as your primary weapon, but also for destroying barriers, creating platforms, and even charging up machinery. There is a generous auto-aim implemented, so you never really have a problem hitting enemies.    Besides the rangs, Ty can also take a large bite out of an enemy, and some enemies require this method of attack. Biting can also be used for destroying crates, working your way up certain ledges, and also as a jump attack much like Mario's butt stomp which also doubles as diving. Other than that, Ty has your standard set of platforming moves like jumping, ledge hanging, gliding, and swimming.    If you've played any other 3D platformer, you'll be right at home controlling Ty. Everything feels quick and responsive, and you never have to think about what you're doing. The game is possibly a little too responsive at times though. You move so quickly the camera spins and turns at speeds that will make any sober person dizzy. You do grow accustomed to it, but sometimes you have to slow down and reorient yourself. Also, the camera has trouble keeping up with your turns, so get used to swinging the camera as you move. If you had no problems with the camera in Mario Sunshine (for you duel system owners out there) then you should have no problems here.   One point of irritation is that some goals require you to complete a different objective prior to it every time you attempt it. For example, one level has you lighting the path for a character so he can get home. After doing this, he asks you to light some fires for him. If you leave the level, you have to light his way home again in order to have him ask you to light the fires. Not a good design choice.   A feature I would've liked to see in the game is an onscreen map. The levels are quite large and finding your way to specific locations would be much less time consuming if you could see where you were going. You can view a map by pressing start, but having to constantly switch back and forth between the main screen and map gets old fast. Also, due to the size of the levels, there are many checkpoints strewn throughout the level. These checkpoints are not flags, or signs, or any other checkpoint staple we've seen in other games. They are in fact outhouses that magically appear at predetermined spots. When you die and re-spawn at the checkpoint, you hear Ty let out a sigh of relief and hop out of the toilet. Is this some strange Australian custom we haven't heard about?    Ty the Tasmanian Tiger does have a lot to like about it though. There are some really clever puzzles, and the levels have a smart variety to them. Rarely does the game seem old. The short game time is probably a contributing factor. Most skilled gamers can finish this game in 10-15 hours, while younger players may actually have some difficulty finishing it, especially with the boss battles and figuring out what to do in the more open-ended sections. Certainly more challenging than it seems for the childish set.   Graphics  Make no mistake about it, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is one terrific looking game. Bright, colorful graphics are highlighted with a host of little details that aren't quite noticeable at first. It wasn't until several hours into the game that we noticed Ty's real-time reflection in the water. Or how its possible to only see his toe prints in the ground when Ty tiptoes, yet you see his whole paw print when he's walking. Other notable moments include the great ice distortion and the underwater movement when standing still.   But it seems for every little detail that was put it one was left out. When Ty is holding onto his fiery Flamerangs for instance, the soft glow created on his model looks great. The problem is that the flames dynamically light only Ty. The environment or other characters in the general vicinity are left untouched. This creates an odd effect that is not only immediately noticeable, but bothersome too. The same goes for the real-time water reflections --You'll see our favorite tiger, but that's it.    Speaking of our favorite tiger, he's the least appealing character in the game. Despite his uncanny resemblance to Penny's faithful mutt from Inspector Gadget, he doesn't have the same lasting appeal associated with being a videogame mascot. In fact, all of the character designs have that similar feeling of being cute, cuddly, and generic. Having a more distinct character design could have helped things along quite a bit.   On a smaller (but important) note for Widescreen television owners, support for that format has been included in addition to the standard picture size. A feature we've noticed to be more prolific as more and more games come down the pipeline, it's still always a nice bonus to see when checking out the visual options.   Sound  Ty makes for a truly pleasing aural experience. The background music is full of catchy bass lines and pleasant tunes, and supports digital surround sound for high-end receiver users. Though it doesn't make for that big of a difference in comparison to the standard stereo track. This is most likely attributed to the fact that while the music is great, the sound effects are rather plain. Spatial positioning is relatively accurate, but it lacks the oomph of other game soundtracks, like Lord of the Rings or the RPG giant Suikoden III.    The voices in the game are a nice highlight however. A definite cut above most titles; the humorous tilt and well-acted vocal work make a strong showing. For the most part, the majority of the characters speak in a strong, friendly Australian accent that is very reminiscent of the Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin. Whether that's a blessing or a curse is up to you, but we dig it. As an added bonus, there's even enough Australian lingo to keep your personal dictionary filled for weeks. Nice!Ty the Tasmanian Tiger makes no effort in hiding its influences. This is a Crash Bandicoot clone through and through. But at least it's done in a manner that flatters the source material extremely well. There's item collecting, a hub world connecting several elemental mini-worlds, and lots of characters full of personality. Not quite on the same level as say, something from Naughty Dog or Rare, Krome Studios own attempt at platforming is still enough to warrant a purchase from diehard genre fans. Deserving of a multi-hour play test. Check it out.", "date": "Oct 16, 2002"}
