Well, personally, I'm convinced that that just depends on the game.  You see, I was one of the laziest little farts on the planet when I was young.  To me, activity consisted of going from the couch to the fridge and back for a Pepsi during a marathon session of Ikarri Warriors.  As for all these ~sports,~ well, when was the last time Johnny Quarterback drove a tank?.   Then came the day that a crazy coincidence changed my outlook on games, and my outlook on life.  That was the first day back from Christmas vacation in eighth grade.  That's when I traded a friend my copy of Bases Loaded for his copies of Lakers vs. Celtics and John Madden Football.  And that, my friends, is when I fell in love with the sport of basketball.  I can still remember pronouncing Patrick Ewing's name the way it looks and getting laughed at by older brother, but no one laughed at the way I took him to the hole. I may not have known much about the sport, but I was completely captivated.  This obsession eventually led to my own little ~career~ in the actual sport (well, if you could call riding the bench for a hormonally imbalanced egomaniac for a couple years a career, then call me Magic Johnson).  Anyways, from that day forward, I was hooked, and have worn out nearly every hoops game to appear on a console since then.   The pinnacle of digital roundball has been unquestionably maintained by the fine folks at EA Sports now for nearly a decade (holy $#1#, I am an old fart), but with the arrival of Sega Sport's NFL2K, the football genre had found a new leader.  So when I finally got a reviewable of Visual Concepts NBA2K, I just had to check it out.  I mean, I like football, but I absolutely love hoops.  But would it be enough to dethrone Live?  Would it be the same leap we saw with NFL?  Would I finally find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Tootsie Pop (And no, it isn't three..we all know Mr. Owl cheated.)?  Well, folks, I have been to the court that Visual Concepts built.  I have tasted the sweet goodness of motion captured honey, and I have climbed the mountain that is coming to grips with the effects on gameplay that such a burden brings with it.  And now, I come to you with my thoughts, so pull up a chair (as if you weren't in one already), and have a look.  First off, let me say that the sound in NBA2K is very impressive.  The play-by-play is a bit glitchy, but is worlds beyond what I've seen from anyone else.  Not only do they actually use different names for each player, including nicknames, but you get trash talk from players, the arena announcer, color commentary, coaches, and more.  I won't even get in to how many times I hopped up and down with Barkely away from the ball just to hear him hit the floor.  The level of detail kicks much ass, and you'll really be impressed.    And simply because I love hearing from my peers that I am obsessed with visuals, I'd also like to tell you a bit about how impressive NBA2K looks.  Now, I could tell you that it makes NBA Live 2000 look like Will Purdue trying to contain Iverson on the perimeter, but anyone with half a clue should already know that.  What I will say is that this title so effortlessly eclipses all other attempts at realism in the basketball arena that even bothering to assert that anything comes close is just plain foolish.  Everything is there, from cross-overs to off-balance rebounds, and it all comes at ya at a blazing 60.  I guess the best way to put it is, you can't go back.  Once you've played  2K, unless you're under the influence of some sort of mind-altering substance, the mere thought of a looking at a hoops title on any other platform will be enough to make you sick.  Trust me I know...how do I know? Well, we'll get to that in a bit.  Anyways, that said, I don't want you to think the game's visuals are perfect.  Some of the player faces are much better than others and the still player animations are not quite as sharp as NFL2K, but the game's biggest problem is clipping.  Players will cut through each other a lot more often than I'd care to see, but it's not that evident in replays, and is an evil I'm willing to put up with, at least in this generation.  The reason being that you can tell that VC really struggled with finding the proper balance between realism and gameplay with NBA2K, and though there are a few points that could have been stronger in this area that I'll be addressing in short order, the game is still easily the most challenging, realistic basketball simulation on the market today.  Here's a good example.  Rebounding.  In the game, things like timing, position and player attributes all obviously factor in to the rebounding dynamic, but at the same time, you can't really put a butt on your opponent's thigh and keep him off the ball.  The thing is, I only notice this because everything else about rebounding I so on-spot.  Moreover, it is pretty easy to get pissed over things like this that are missing, but in comparison to other hoops title, where rebounding mechanics consist of jumping up and watching the collision detection in action, this game is a godsend.  The same could be said of posting up.  The way you can back a guy down and then spin off is very realistic, and VC has also manage to capture the way you have to handle a play like this on defense quite well.  NBA2K does the best job to date of capturing the hopelessness of being manhandled by Shaq, and by the same token, it does a great job of recreating the feel of being in the pit trying to stop Big Dog from backing you down.  However, I couldn't help but feel like working in to a realistic shot from this position was way to tricky.  Ya see my problem, on one hand, I have a wonderful addition to the genre in play mechanics, yet on the other, it just manages to raise the bar so high that I expect much more from the game.  I really love the fact that that you can really ~earn~ each drive for the first time, but by the same token, Kobe ain't got no hook shot, and Vince Carter is not going to shoot a standing jump shot from two feet in after he has beaten his man off the dribble.  I don't care how friggin' tired he is. I guess what I'm trying to say is that as good as it is, NBA2K doesn't do quite as good of a job in the player re-creation department as it's football counterpart, and I expected a little more.  This is really obvious when it comes to jump shots, where the game really seems to demand too much from the player in terms of timing.  I don't care how off I am, The Dream is not going to miss 5 uncontested baskets from inside the paint, nor will Dell Curry go 1-12 on 3 pointers with no one on him. If you time it perfect, you can get a realistic percentage, but who are we kidding in insinuating that anyone will pull that off game-in and game-out? Also, I have a hard time swallowing that a big man can't throw a pass more than 20 feet without turning the ball over. Close fellahs, but not quite.  Player behavior may not be as accurate as I'd like, but one area the game does nail like so many threes from my boy Reggie is player speed and mobility.  I can't tell you how much I was impressed by the overall speed of players.  Be it running and gunning with Eddie Jones in transition or watching the Candyman trip over his own feet, the ballers in NBA2K are all quite accurate when it comes to their real-life abilities and if you have control of them, you can totally play the role if you know it.  On top of that it adds a wealth of depth to the gameplay department in terms of exploiting player match-ups, which is probably one of my favorite aspects of the game.  Not only can you back down a bad defender much easier than you can get by someone like Robinson in the paint, but having a guy like Garnett on the perimeter is a nightmare for a slower defender, and the better you get a handling the rock, the more intense each possession becomes.  But forget about individual player movements.  This game's real strength lies in team player sets.  I was really happy to see how active each player was, regardless of whether or not you called a set. The ability to call for a pick and actually run something like a screen away from the ball or a realistic pick and roll without any button mashing is just plain awesome.  As long as you pay attention to player movements, you can almost always get the ball to the designated player and make a realistic play, and that in and of itself is a very important advancement in the genre.  On the other hand, unless you throw the pass at just the right moment, it is hecka hard to hit a cutter in stride, and this in and of itself has to be the single most frustrating aspect of NBA2K.  There is nothing worse than having someone like Sprewell chrunin' down the court in an open lane only to stop for the pass instead of catching it mid-run.  Eventually, you'll be able to determine which passes will result in this evil and which ones won't, but I'm afraid it happens a bit too often for my tastes, and keeps NBA2K from getting a better score.   What's even more frustrating is the fact that the computer has absolutely no problems in this area, and they will abuse your sorry ass of you get in the habit of playing this game like you play NBA Live or Shootout.  You cannot double team unless you're prepared to make a mad dash for the hoop, and by the same token, you had better pay attention to cutters and play helpside, because much like yourself, the computer loves to throw down.  At first, I got a little pissed at all the touch passes and fluent alley-oops, and I have to confess that I was a bit mad that teams like Phoenix could just work me in transition, but the more I played, the more I noticed NBA2K's other shining attribute:  AI.  This game can flat out play.  That's all there is to it.  Touch passes, stripping and going after the loose ball, blocks, defensive help, traps, holding the ball, feeding the hot hand. You name it, chances are it is here and it is really friggin' close to being there.  Now, understand that this is coming from a Live fanatic, and I've already heard comments to the effect that Live plays better. That driving is way too easy on the computer.  That EA Sports is god, etc. etc.  But before I put any real stock in that mess, I went and played a few quarters of this year's version, just to be sure.  Hate to break it to ya boys, but I popped in Live 2000, upped the difficulty to the max and took to the court against the Spurs with the almighty Clippers, and that's when things got ugly.  No, I'm not talking about Hudson's J outside 15 feet. I am referring to how I then proceeded to take the Marvelous Mo' to the rack 7 straight trips down the court uncontested and then go on to basically man-handle one of the best defenses in the league.  But what does all this have to do with NBA2K?  Well, I have played through nearly a whole season of NBA2K to date, and I am having trouble giving the Admiral and Co. a good game with even the best teams., despite the fact that I own Boulding in 2-player.  Considering I've been at video game hoops for quite a while now, that says something to me.  Mainly that this game is one thing the Live series hasn't been for years: Competitive.  And to me, that is a major, major plus.  Call me crazy.  Obviously, the two-player experience is full of dunks, but unless you are dealing with someone who can play iron defense, there always will be.  I mean really, if you can't drop your buddy with a head fake, then why bother to have it in the game? At least this time around you have to work for each drive.  But before I totally ooze on this area of the game, I would like to give out an official Cheap Bastard Award to the game's AI for the way it handles officiating, which is primarily an issue when driving.   2K allows for waaaay to much contact when the computer has the ball, and if there is a call, 9 times out of 10 it will be a block on your player, even if your standing still.  Granted, if you actually make use of the game's ~defensive stance~ button, you wouldn't be getting the contact call in real life, either, as you have to be upright to get the charge, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why the game  calls this mess so one-sided. It seems that almost every call in that area goes against my boys, but I hardly every see it come down on the bad guys.  ~So and so hits the deck, but there's no whistle~ is about all I ever heard.  I hate to tell you this, but if this game is gonna insist on slamming the likes of Kemp to the floor (and let me tell you, the lockout was not his waistline's friend.  It takes a lot to move this boy), I expect a call.  Especially if there is an injury.  I am knowing that someone hit somebody if my player is out for 6-8 with a broken hand.  Where's my friggin' foul?  Obviously, VC wanted to keep the game a bit more arcadey, and calling every little nick would slow the game down to a crawl because in real life, players would make adjustments to avoid contact, but I really wish the game could have been a bit more balanced in the frequency of calls, or at least a bit more lenient on the player when it came to bumping an offensive player when the contact was incidental, as a block never seems to effect the shot.  Oh well.  I know I'm ranting, but while I'm on fire, I might as well let one last shot go.  If there is anything this game convinced me of without question, it is that the Dreamcast controller absolutely blows when it comes to sports gaming.  This thing was suspect when it came to football, but after trying to call plays and continue to keep the ball moving, this thing is simply not functional.  You see, you have to use the d-pad to call a play, but doing so requires you to completely shift your hands which, in turn, leads to the inability to keep running the floor.  To put it bluntly, this just sucks.  I have heard rumors that Sega is looking in to the possibility of a sports controller to help make this sort of stuff less difficult, and if me whining about it has any affect on the decision to move forward with the development of such a device, let me say for the record MAKE THE CONTROLLER, DAMN YOU!!! THIS IS PAINFUL!!!  Eh-hem.  Thankfully, you can master a little thumb rolling with time, or simply opt to let the cpu make your calls for you, but it would still be nice to have about two more buttons.  Let's hope next year brings us a controller that will allow for just that.  Lastly, I wanted to comment on one of the game's best aspects.  Free-throws.  Now, I'll admit, I hated this aspect in the early going, and I still think it is way to difficult with certain shooters, but either way, this game's free-throw mechanic is awesome!  Not only is infinitely more interactive than timing a meter, but it really does a good job of putting the pressure on a player on the line.  It just adds so much to the experience, and really makes good use of the controller.    Anyways.  So enough rambling.  I've had a lot to say about the game, and I know a lot of it seems negative.  But in the end, how did I really feel about the NBA2K?  I guess the easiest way to put it is that while the game has issues, it is easily worlds beyond anything else on the market, and truly raises the bar for video game basketball.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it has done so in such a manner that even the high-jumping designers at Visual Concepts have difficulty clearing their own newfound level of excellence.  Many aspects of this game are unbelievable, but it is the type of game that does just as much to open your eyes to the possibilities as it does to blow you away.  In the end, we've got one hell of a basketball game, but a game that is far from perfect.  While not quite as polished as NFL2K, NBA2K is most certainly a must have title for any sport fan, and is one of the most compelling reasons to own a Dreamcast to date.  Bring on NBA 2001, boys, and next year, think three free-throws.  Three!  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
