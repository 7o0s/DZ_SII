It's a tour de force that effortlessly sucks the player into its world, introducing a loveable set of characters, a historical mystery storyline and the game's amazingly realised jungle environments. To say we swooned would be an understatement. It was more like love at first sight. Hyperbole? Not really; the game has an easy charm that's impossible to resist.   Developer Naughty Dog has designed Uncharted to be a gaming equivalent to the great pulp adventure stories of eras past. Think Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider and you'd be on the right track. As such, the lead character Nathan Drake is something of a loveable rogue; a treasure hunter who's used to operating on the fringes of society and looking out for number one. He's a character everyone is familiar with  charming and funny, the sort of guy who's probably talked his way out of more scrapes than he's fought his way out from, but he's impeccably realised and truly likeable. His laidback, easygoing style fits in well with his 'business partner' Sully, a man of advancing years who's seen his fair share of action (in both senses of the word) and who isn't in the treasure hunting for the fame or the glory. He's in it for the money. The final piece of the puzzle is Elena, a strong-willed documentary maker who has helped fund Drake's expedition.   Rickety old bridge? Check. Mine cart section? Nope. Do jet-skis count?  As the game opens, we find Drake and Elena aboard a boat in the Pacific Ocean, prising open Sir Francis Drake's coffin. Inside, there's no desiccated corpse but a small metal box containing Drake's journal, which sets the pair  along with Sully  on a hunt for the fantastic treasure of El Dorado, and the truth about Sir Francis Drake's demise. That's all I'll say specifically about the story, but you probably have a fair idea what to expect  revelations, twists and Nazis. There's always Nazis.   One of the reasons Uncharted makes such a stunning first impression is that its world feels truly lived in and organic. The first hour or so sees Sully and Nathan moving through rich tropical jungle environments and ancient underground chambers, and to say Uncharted takes the gene to a new level in terms of presentation would be an understatement. As they make their way along streambeds and clamber over moss-covered rocks, the density of the jungle is quite staggering. A cacophony of life and colour, the densely-packed trees strive for the sun, while the breaks in the canopy send shafts of dappled light down onto the ground below. A breeze picks up and the foliage sways in response, while the underbrush parts as Drake makes his way through it.   It's gorgeously realised, and Drake makes his way through with consummate ease. Given that brilliantly responsive controls are one of Naughty Dog's hallmarks, you'd expect nothing less, but the way Drake climbs and jumps through this overgrown world is hugely impressive, while there are a host of custom animations built for specific sections  one area sees Drake making his way through cramped, claustrophobic passages (to say more would spoil it), and the way he ducks down to step through narrow entrances and naturalistically puts one hand on the side of a doorway as he moves through are so perfect it's scary.    The interactions between the pair are just as believable. Sully and Drake really work like a team  Sully winds a chain to raise a door so that Drake can get under and find him another way in. Adding to the immersion, the pair banter constantly as they progress  joking and reacting to events. The dialogue is easy and funny, operating both as a way to warm the player to the characters and as an intuitive hints system.   Sadly, Nathan usually picks up the three-shot grenade launcher after the action's over.  Of course, it's not too long before the solitude of the ancient surroundings is shattered, triggering a mad dash back through the level towards safety. Drake controls almost as well in combat as he does when exploring. Gunplay is largely the order of the day here, with L1 bringing up Drake's sight and R1 used to pull the trigger. As you'd expect from a modern title, Drake can utilise his surroundings to take cover, and diving from cover to cover, leaping over low cover objects and peering out to shoot from behind cover is gratifyingly straightforward. Hell, Drake can even hang from a ledge and pop up to shoot. Melee combat is handled well too  there's an array of combos, from leaping on an enemy and breaking his neck, to the ol' one-two-nut-kick combo. With the right combo and good timing Drake can even net twice the ammo haul from a downed enemy.   The first two hours or so, then, are like a manual on how to reinvent the action adventure game for the modern era  great characters, the perfect balance between exploration/puzzle solving and action, and a gloriously immersive environment. Sadly, while the game remains compelling for its entire duration, the gameplay balance doesn't remain quite as well-honed.    Simply put, we think this game would have been better served as an adventure game with action, rather than the other way around, which is often how it feels. Don't get us wrong, the combat is mostly great. Much like Gears of War, environments are littered with cover objects, and enemies attack in waves and from multiple positions. While they're not overly clever, they do fan out to try and take you down, they do utilise cover and they can often take close to a full clip from a pistol before going down, so firefights are generally pretty tense. Still, the sheer amount of lead enemies can absorb is a little ridiculous  at the very least they should act wounded, while single kill headshots are frustratingly unreliable  the actual hit zone is uncompromisingly small, so what looks like a head shot often isn't. While there are a number of single-shot-kill pistols that the player can pick up, and a good spray from an AK-47 will generally take an enemy down, with opponents that come in such numbers, snappier kills would have helped keep the game's pace sprightly.   The enemy mercenaries are a little generic but that just means you don't feel bad when pummelling them.  The bullet-sponge enemies also mean that you're less inclined to try and move forward through an area. The designers have obviously designed the environments with progression in mind  moving from cover to cover, picking up extra ammo or weapons as you do, but more often than not it's simply safer sitting back trying to pick enemies off. After all, Drake can get killed in close to an instant, so that ill-advised move forwards can often see you playing through a long combat section again. Better to sit back and hide behind cover when you take a hit. As a result of this, the shotgun is one of the most under-used weapons in the game, and you'll only occasionally make use of Drake's killer melee abilities. Shame.   The combat, then, is entertaining, but can drag a little bit. The same cannot be said for the exploration component of the game, which  although it doesn't really bring anything to the genre we haven't see before - is thrilling and fun nonetheless. Whether you're scaling a sheer castle wall by leaping from handhold to handhold and using hanging vines to wall run, or you're scoping out the best way to climb and move about some crumbled ancient ruins, this component of the game is rock solid. That said, a little more challenge wouldn't have gone astray. It never takes long to suss out the correct path, nor are there many alternate paths. We were also disappointed that puzzles didn't come into the game a little more  especially after such a promising opening section. Indeed, those that do appear later in the game are just far too simple, never requiring more than a moment's thought. Plus, they're often pointless. Those two puzzles you just 'solved' to get deep underneath the monastery? Irrelevant, because the place is somehow swarming with guards.    The water effects are top notch, and Nathan's clothes get wet too. What an age we live in.  It's really a question of balance. The opening couple of hours ably demonstrated that we don't need combat every five or ten minutes to feel immersed in this world, yet after that point you're constantly being interrupted by enemies, even when it doesn't make much sense. Like we said, the game would have been better served to shift the balance away from combat slightly, and to beef up the exploration and puzzle solving components. With more challenge in getting around the environments, and more thinking required to progress, this game could easily have scored in the mid-9s. As it stands, Naughty Dog actually ramps the game up in the opposite direction, with a final set of missions that shift the tone completely and in some sections actually force you to abandon the use of aiming and cover. It's deliberate certainly, and definitely tense, but perhaps not the most fulfilling option to take.  Despite our complaints, we were thoroughly entertained throughout Uncharted: Drakes Fortune. It effortlessly captures the feel of a classic, rollicking pulp adventure film through charming, fallible characters, great dialogue and voice acting, over-the-top action sequences, and a story featuring plenty of twists and turns. Its a visual triumph too; as technically astute as it is aesthetically realised. Indeed, there'll be a moment in the game, perhaps after you've climbed a sheer cliff face and have paused to look out across a serene jungle vista while water cascades down from atop the overhang youre perching beneath, when youll realise that the next evolution of the action adventure game is truly here. Naughty Dog just has to perfect it.", "date": "Dec 4, 2007"}
