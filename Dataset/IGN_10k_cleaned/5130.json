An underworld gunman who in premeditation shoots a victim.   2. A gunman; a shooter: ~Where is the moral justification... in offering the platoon survivors -- the actual triggermen -- immunity?~ (Nelson DeMille).  3. A PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GC third-person shooter that can be easily identified by the following characteristics...   Its most advanced control maneuver is duck.  Its second advanced control maneuver is jump.  Aside from jumping and ducking, it features no other advanced control maneuvers.  Its AI spastically runs about.   Its AI courageously runs straight into streams of gunfire.  Its AI stands in place...indefinitely.  Its corpses vanish into the ether realm .05 seconds after death.  Its level design philosophy begins and ends with ~angular brown.~  Its characters resemble Cro-Magnon man's early attempts at a marionette.  I Hate Good  Its gunfire sounds as if bullets were being spat through the short-circuiting audio system of a decrepit subway.  Its instruction manual is a whopping eight pages of content and three pages of blank ~Notes~ fields.  Its brand of interactivity demands totally indestructible everything.  Its objectives often require the player to avoid being detected, but avoiding detection on the twentieth try is still nearly impossible.  Its unarmored enemies can take up to ten bullets to kill.  Its missions take three minutes to run through but one hour to complete, as a result of all the trial and error dying.  Its story is never more elaborate than, ~Hey, me mobster. You also mobster. You shoot for me, okay?~  Its drab music often emulates that of an elevator, or mortuary, or elevated mortuary.  Its levels are spaced out into predictable sections, between each there lies health.   Its animation emulates GTA, all of the sloppy parts, anyway.  Its greatest technical achievement is the throwing knife cam (throwing knives can kill or do no damage at all, depending on what day it is).  Its ammo replenishment system is a giant box of ~press X.~  Its enemies use and drop shotguns, but they are apparently alien, since the player cannot use them.  Its art style forgoes actual textures in favor of vast expanses of blur.  Its idea of action implies extreme ammo conservation.  Its specific brand of longevity includes eight pointless missions and one promise: it will microwave up real pretty.  It's a game called Trigger Man -- a game that emphasizes knife use more than anything.  Trigger Man is unrespectable. It's shoddy, mindless, inane, boring, drab, frustrating, limited, poor, ugly, difficult, stiff, slow, unbalanced, and without a shred of worth when compared to just about anything that has ever existed (Bad Boys included).", "date": "Oct 16, 2004"}
