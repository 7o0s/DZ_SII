That's not true, of course, but it's still an easy impression to get  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the black sheep of the Legend of Zelda franchise, a game mostly outcast from its series' numerous accolades for nearly now two decades. Only because it's different. Zelda II is derided for its shift in direction, in play perspective, and in gameplay mechanics. But if you give the game a chance, letting it stand on its own merits, letting go of the fact that it's ~not like the others,~ you could find yourself having a lot of fun with this too-insulted sequel.   Link has returned. Fresh from his victory in the original Legend of Zelda, the green-garbed hero has little chance to celebrate his defeat of the dark wizard Ganon before he's targeted for assassination  Ganon's loyal, still-living minions are out to murder the young elfin hero, seeking to use his blood to resurrect their fallen leader. While on the run from the pig-man's men, Link finds himself taking up a new quest to return six shards of a magic crystal to six scattered temples, to release the magical seal on Hyrule's Great Palace, to then enter into that labyrinth and reclaim the lost Triforce of Courage. All to save Princess Zelda, of course.        But that you're questing to rescue Zelda and recover a Triforce is pretty much all Zelda II has in common with the first chapter of the Legend  the gameplay is completely altered. Where Zelda I was played as a top-down action/adventure with a strong emphasis on puzzle-solving, Zelda II is instead a side-scrolling action/platformer with the focus placed on combat.     Link begins his Adventure by entering into a familiar scene  walking out of the starting-point palace, the overworld of Hyrule sprawls across the screen in every direction, rendered from the established birds-eye view. Straying off the safety of the roadways, though, triggers the first of the differences  enemies appear in swarms of three and move to intercept you, and, if they make contact, you're cast into an on-the-spot side-scrolling clash against Ganon's forces. The ~see them coming before they attack~ mechanic was novel in its usage here. Most RPGs of the day didn't bother, instead employing random screen transitions to initiate combat sequences.   And Zelda II has more in common with the RPG genre, too, as in this game Link actually earns experience points and ~levels up~ in three different areas  attack strength, hit point defense and magic power. Felling foes and finding XP-boosting bags increases a counter in the top-right corner of the screen. After tallying up a set amount, a menu appears and offers you the option of making Link either A) do more damage with his sword, B) take less damage himself from enemy attacks, or C) use fewer magic meter points when casting spells.      The casting spells mechanic is yet another innovation only seen in Zelda II. Link finds plenty of meter-fueled magic items in other games, but here his sorcery is purely memorized  visiting wizened old wizards in the game's vast array of NPC-populated towns earns the hero the knowledge to invoke such enchantments as Jump, which doubles his leaping height, Fire, which causes balls of flame to project from his blade, or Fairy, which transforms him bodily into one of the series' signature little flying pixies. Fairy form even lets Link fly through the keyholes of locked doors, by-passing the need to find keys in the game's many labyrinths.   An added bonus  the game as played through the Virtual Console is superior to its original NES incarnation in an important way. The VC allows you to pause your progress with save states, picking up where you left off later if you want to take a break and turn off your console. Doing that keeps your accumulated experience points intact, which wasn't always the case  saving in the traditional way on the NES would always reset the XP counter back to zero every time (if you hadn't yet gained enough points to advance to the next level, that is). It's a frustration that gamers of the '80s will be happy to be rid of  many players back in '88 would just leave their systems' power turned on and running for days on end just to avoid losing that progress.  It's little touches like that, along with the game's tight, precise control and incredibly intimidating challenge factor that make this Adventure a hit. Zelda II is just a great game, and playing it again today makes it hard to understand why it's been so chastised for the past 20 years. Nintendo clearly recognizes its worth, selecting it as the standard-bearer to be the 100th game on the Virtual Console. Now you should give it a chance, too. For only 500 Wii Points, it's a spectacular, underappreciated value. Nobody likes Zelda II  but that's not true. And maybe, now, that perspective will change.", "date": "Jun 4, 2007"}
