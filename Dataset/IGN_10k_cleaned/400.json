The game ingeniously paired sick and twisted humor with dark and eerie graphics. Then they topped that off with a heaping helping of gore, and the PlayStation had one of its best shooters in the bag. Pretty much the only thing bad you could say about it was it lacked a real plot. But if shooting was your thing...   The announcement of a sequel came as no surprise. However, when the game finally arrived, everybody was surprised... at how bad it was! Was this really the same team that made the first one? It was, unfortunately.   Almost every great aspect of the original game has been compromised. To begin with, the graphics aren't nearly the spectacle the first one was. Gone are the dark corridors and shadowy rooms. Reloaded has replaced them with bright desert canyons and funky-colored streets. But what really made Loaded great was the exceptional light sourcing - every gun burst lit up the dark rooms and everyone within range like a firecracker going off. Unfortunately, Reloaded isn't nearly as impressive.   In fact, it's almost laughable. The detailing on the characters is so sparse, in some cases they look transparent. In the first level, there is absolutely no color on the people attacking you. Plus, someone decided those enemies should be the same color as the surrounding grounds, which makes them impossible to see. The detailing gets a little better in the later levels, but you're still stuck with just one or two types of enemies in each level, multiplied endlessly.   Reloaded has made a few new additions to the game that don't entirely suck. Three of the old characters have been replaced, and the characters still look real wacky. And, while Loaded kept you confined to one plane all the time, Reloaded lets you walk up and down embankments. In fact, it's an intricate part to your wanderings. These do not make up for the rest of the game, though.   Everything about Loaded came together into one coherent unit - scary music, eerie lighting, big guns, etc. Reloaded has gone for a lighter feel, and ended up with a third rate game. Don't even bother.", "date": "Dec 24, 1996"}
