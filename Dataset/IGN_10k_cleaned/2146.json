It was impossible to make something that really looked like a car, plane, or boat, because the pieces were all pretty much just rectangular blocks -- you had to do your best and use your imagination. Legos have evolved since then, pieces are more varied and it's now possible to make models of things like the Millennium Falcon that actually look like the real thing. Ah, how times have changed.   Legos have also made the leap into the world of interactive videogames, with the latest being Lego Racers 2, which has been developed for Lego Media by Attention to Detail (ATD), the company responsible highly enjoyable futuristic racing game for PlayStation, Rollcage. Whereas Rollcage borrowed heavily from the likes of Wipeout and F-Zero, Lego Racers 2 falls more in line with Nintendo's Mario Kart series.  The game's main mode is the Adventure mode, and in this, the player must venture to try and challenge some dude named Rocket Racer on Xalax by competing in and winning all sorts of various races. Winning races will unlock more tracks, worlds and other races, and in progressing through the adventure mode, the player will have a chance to build, design and eventually enhance a driver and car.   There are a ton of upgradeable features for the cars and each stage in the story mode ends with a race against a boss character that will surrender a key car part when you defeat it. More importantly, the game has a lot of instant appeal, as it's easy to pick-up-and-play and regardless of you previous experience with racing games, kart or otherwise, the learning curve is pretty short.   The problem with this is that it just might be too short and too shallow of a racing game for those looking for some serious competition or something new. Even though there are a lot of really cool mini-games that will help keep the game feeling fresh, the actual racing doesn't really bring much new to the genre and the unimaginative and often boring track designs don't help make things any better.   Another strike against it is that the game only supports multiplayer play for two players. While there are quite a few two-player gameplay modes, including tournament and battle, it just doesn't cut it when there are similar games that have been out for years that have four-player support. It's obviously not because of any shortcomings with the hardware, either, as the game's graphics aren't what you'd expect of a game coming out near the end of the first full year of the PS2's US lifespan.   The lighting effects are good, but the general quality of the textures on the vehicles and backgrounds are sup bar and the game just doesn't look that fascinating. There aren't too many glaring flaws and the framerate is generally smooth, but considering the lack of polygons and unimpressive texture work, you'd think that the game would be running at 60 fps and that doesn't appear to be the case here. It's not that it's a bad looking game, but rather another case of a game that just doesn't look quite as good as what's coming out for the system.  The music in the game fits the Lego theme quite well, and so do the squeaky and overly cute voices. But, while they may sound really cute to some, they'll surely annoy others after hearing them for a while, as that's what happened with me. And you probably should keep in mind that I'm usually a sucker for the cute, big-head, big-eye crap that comes out of Japan, so it's not just because I'm too mature for a cutesy, kiddie game. Lego Racers 2 is an enjoyable racing game, but it's not really something that I'd suggest spending $40 on, especially considering all of the better games that are currently or will soon be available for Sony's much-improved and often ridiculed black box. It's also worth noting that this same game is already available for the PC for a much more reasonable price tag of $19.99 -- a price point that would have made this PS2 game about twice as appealing as it is at its current price.", "date": "Oct 4, 2001"}
