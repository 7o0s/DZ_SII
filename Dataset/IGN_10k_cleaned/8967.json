Mayonnaise on pizza? Check. A dress with stripes and polka dots? Done. The Prime Minister singing Karaoke? Why not. But there are ever more extremes to aspire to, which might be why composer Nobuo Uematsu has completely chucked conventional wisdom out the window in order to make the expansive soundtrack for Blue Dragon. Featuring over fifty tracks spread over two discs, you can almost imagine Uematsu's excitement as he mixes and matches different musical genres not normally paired together. The result is a crazy quilt of Rock, Caribbean, Classical and New Wave, as if Uematsu threw CDs of Van Halen, Bob Marley, Megumi Hayashibara, Chopin and The Pet Shop Boys into a dryer and hit ~spin.~     The album starts off with Waterside, a soft medley that is slow and bitter-sweet. From there it takes a sharp left turn with Dragon Fight, a head-banging guitar rift that serves as a battle track for the game and gets the blood pumping. From there the album zig-zags between harpsichord heavy pieces like Anger & Sorrow to sugary J-Pop tunes like Bad But Bat. It's certainly different, but there's no thread that ties them together, making the album somewhat schizophrenic. One minute you're tapping your feet to the spicy, cumin- infused Giant Mechat track, only to turn around and find yourself in the tropical Caribbean with Dance-Loving Devi Tribe.  Then, before you can even lay back and enjoy the rum, you're suddenly transported to a heavy metal concert via An Ancient Fortress, which sounds suspiciously like an updated version of Final Fantasy VI's Troops March On. This spastic genre hopping gives the album the feeling of a mixed tape; interesting to listen to but featuring nothing that hints at an overall theme.   Scream elitist if you will, but Uematsu really misses an opportunity here to strut his stuff under a new company and a new game console. In previous games every conceivable instrument that could be synthesized was used by the composer, giving his scores a depth and breath that made them instant classics. Yet in Blue Dragon Uematsu seems to have gotten stuck in a ~midi~ mind frame; a lot of tracks like Thumbs Up and A Tolling of Lament are so simplistic it sounds like something you'd hear on the SNES, not the Xbox 360.    But the biggest problem with Blue Dragon's soundtrack is that the majority of songs are forgettable. Not one song has that infectious ~hum along~ quality to it found in so many other works by Uematsu.  There's no song that you'll hum as you drive to work or type on the computer. There's no tune that will get stuck in your head all day for weeks. Tracks like Nene's Paradise and An Ancient Fortress come close, but they still fall short of making you want to hit the repeat button over and over again.    Uematsu has become the measuring stick to which we hold all great game composers. His ability to lock tunes into our brains is virtually unmatched.  His ability to touch us with a song is nearly unrivaled. But being so high up in the game music world means he also has farther to fall. The Blue Dragon soundtrack falls short of expectations because it lacks the inspiration and drive that Uematsu has shown in the past.  In fact it's bit ironic that while writing this article I've had the opening theme from Final Fantasy V stuck in my head. And I haven't heard that in weeks.    Definitely Downloads  1.
