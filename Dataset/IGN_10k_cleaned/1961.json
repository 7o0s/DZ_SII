Now, more than 20 years later, comes Defend the Fleet: Pearl Harbor. The game, from developer Running Dog Software and Wayforward Technologies and publisher Infogrames, puts you in the middle of Japan's infamous attack on the U.S. base in Hawaii.   You are charged with manning one anti-aircraft gun on the deck of an U.S. ship, and trying to shoot down as many Japanese planes as you can -- before they sink all your ships. And despite the huge leap in technology (Pentium III PC, GeForce 3 video card) I still felt a little like I was playing good old Air-Sea Battle.  In essence, it is still pretty much a shooting gallery game. Only this time, instead of fuzzy little ducks, blocky planes and rectangular boats, your mission is to shoot down pixilated Zeroes as they zoom overhead.  Our first trouble with the game came was its incompatibility with Voodoo 3 cards. Playing on a Voodoo 3 system brought horribly pixilated graphics that weren't fit for neither man nor beast. A quick check of the readme file included with the game said we should visit Wayforward Technogies website. But alas, they didn't even mention the game there.  Trying the game on a GeForce 3 system brought better results, with much improved graphics. Unfortunately, the graphics engine still can't handle too many objects on screen at one time. Any instance of two or more planes on the screen at one time, and you'll see some serious slowdown, making it that much more difficult to hit your target, as the screen jumps back and forth.  Another graphical problem is the way planes seemingly jump around in the air. One second, you'll be following it with your crosshair as it flies near your ship, and the next it will be all the way across the screen, with nary an explanation of how it got there.  Explosions in the game aren't done too well, either. And this should be a strong point of a Pearl Harbor game, you would think. What else happens at Pearl Harbor but stuff blowing up?! But no, the explosions are pretty poorly drawn, and even worse very unsatisfying. When you finally do down a Zero, it just disappears, with virtually no satisfying ka-boom.  Sound in the game is pretty sparse, other than the rat-ta-tat-tat of your guns as you fire away into the sky. You occasionally hear drivel from pilots (we think) about how hard the Japanese are attacking. It's not very good and doesn't help you in the least.  Eventually, some other American planes are launched to help you out. Unfortunately, they don't seem to do much else than fly around and look pretty. They certainly don't dogfight with the Japanese fighters. Guess it's entirely up to you to repel the Japanese horde.  As for control, it just the mouse, that's it. It works fine for aiming, but we would have liked the choice to use a gamepad if we wanted to do that. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to support any other control configuration.  There's also no multiplayer included in the game. So it's always the same game -- you against the entire Japanese attacking force. There's also no jumping from ship deck to ship deck in an effort to get a better shot. You are confined to the deck of one ship, and must stay there for the duration.  At least you do get to choose from a variety of weapons as the game progresses and you down more and more attack waves of Japanese fighter planes. You'll have access to the .50 caliber and 20 mm guns, the 3~ and 40 mm guns, the .50 cal Gatling and Rockets to try and down the enemy.  One other nice touch is the inclusion of Japanese mini-subs in the fighting mix. You'll occasionally see them skirting across the water, and of course it's your job (who else would do it?) to blow them out of the water.  After each wave, you are rewarded points for accuracy, points, the number of ships that have survived, and your overall health.  Once all your ships are destroyed, the game is over. Despite the fact that we weren't very good at this game, that never happened to us. If you continue to survive, you just face wave after wave of Japanese fighters and suicide bombers as they try to take out all of your ships.  In essence, Defend the Fleet isn't much more than a graphically sophisticated shooting gallery. There's no strategy, no multiplayer, and very little reason to keep playing after the third or fouth level.  But, if you're looking for nothing more sophisticated than a good game that will keep your trigger finger happy, this will be just right for you. Otherwise, just go see the Pearl Harbor movie. You'll learn more, and you get to see that cute Ben Affleck.  -- Mike Morrissey", "date": "Jun 12, 2001"}
