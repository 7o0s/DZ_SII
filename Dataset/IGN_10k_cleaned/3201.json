Swedish developer Iridon has taken the roll-around-a-maze concept and added a cute, shell-backed critter into lead role for this Majesco-published GBA title. The game doesn't offer a whole lot of surprises beyond the formula fully established way early in the adventure, but it does has a nice, addictive quality and the design suits the handheld market well. Features More than fifty levels Training mode Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  However our hero ended up on the island, it doesn't matter; the whole idea is to get Turbo Turtle out of there, and the only way to do this is to get him through more than fifty different challenges. Since turtles are some of the slowest critters around, the best way to move one around is to roll it...and that's exactly what players do in Turbo Turtle Adventure It's up to the player to get this turtle dude through the designed levels, picking up keys and unlocking doors, locating the glowing gate before the time runs out.    Each of the challenges in the game are built with specific elements: crumbling floors, ice surfaces (slippery to the shell), arrows that force the roll into the pointed direction, and a sticky ground that's hard to roll across in any direction. But there are some peppers thrown in the gumbo: rolling near a fan or a gravity generator will cause a slight change in direction, and running into a forcefield will cause the little guy to bounce back with dizzying results. In several instances players can pick up different power-ups that will give the turtle a special ability: grab a ~bounce~ icon and players will be able to leap over gaps. Players can instantly put a one-tile surface on an empty space by picking up a ~builder~ block. And different shell icons cause different results: a Glide shell will make moving over sticky ground a lot easier, and a Spike Shell will give the turtle necessary traction on ice.  The levels in the game are laid out more in a puzzle design than games like Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball's action layouts. Players have to plot out their course carefully, because one screw up (using a key in the wrong area, or activating a power-up in the wrong area) will basically make finishing the level impossible. But unfortunately, it's this trial-and-error design that makes Turbo Turtle Adventure a bit of a drag; sure, you've got unlimited lives and continues, but in several of the levels you actually have to screw up just so you know what not to do next time. This trial-and-error gameplay would have been much more acceptable if the designers gave the player the ability to look ahead at the entire map while trying to solve the challenge; a scaled-back view of the level map would have definitely helped.  The game has a lot of levels, including several hidden ones that can only be obtained if you find an alternate gate. That's a whole lot of gameplay in Turbo Turtle Adventure, but don't expect any real surprises along the way...most of the levels, including the secret ones, feature all of the same elements. There aren't any really unique extras later in the game beyond bigger and more elaborate puzzle challenges. I've always been a fan of the marble-rolling game genre, and Turbo Turtle Adventure is a solid first attempt at the idea on the GBA. There are a lot of levels in this puzzle title, but the trial-and-error gameplay makes it a different, not quite as intense breed than the Marble Madness / Super Monkey Ball action design. Turbo Turtle Adventure isn't an instant classic on the GBA, but it is a good handheld game for players looking for a basic, pick-up-and-play title that offers a decent challenge all the way through.", "date": "Nov 14, 2002"}
