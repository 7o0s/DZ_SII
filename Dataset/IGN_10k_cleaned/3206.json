{"name": "Mario Bros.", "name_review": "Mario Bros.-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/mario-bros-e", "text": "has been released for all sorts of systems...actually, it's shipped three times before in Nintendo's remakes Super Mario Advance, Super Mario World, and Yoshi's Island for the Game Boy Advance. So, it's a little weird to see the game show up one more time on the system...in this case, Mario Bros.-e is in card format for the e-Reader peripheral. Players will have to scan five cards into the e-Reader device to play this version. Mario Bros.-e is the NES conversion of the arcade game, but the game design is near identical. Mario has to clear the area of all sorts of dangerous creatures by bouncing them on their backs from underneath, then kicking them out of play while they're incapacitated. Turtles can be flipped instantly, while crabs have to be bounced twice. Fighter Flies can only be flipped when they're touching the surface, which makes them incredibly hard to get rid of. And then, of course, there's the random fireball that's out to toast our plumber.  The game is still a lot of fun, but the problem is the same with the other e-Reader games: no two-player support. I'm guessing that the e-Reader NES emulator lacks any support for the link port, so there's no way to play the game both with Mario and Luigi at the same time. And besides, this game was only released for nostalgia purposes, as the remakes on the three Super Mario Advance titles were plenty good with way more features.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
