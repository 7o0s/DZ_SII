Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/28/dr-seuss-how-the-grinch-stole-christmas-review", "text": "It's that time of the year again, when game publishers churn out Christmas-themed licensed crap in order to squeeze a last couple of bucks out of unsuspecting parents. Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! for the Nintendo DS is based on the classic book and cartoon of the same name, but with all creativity, charm, depth and enjoyment drained out.    The game is a shallow Elevator Action-style stealth game where players must navigate the Grinch around a house at night, avoiding night owls and sleep walkers, in an attempt to steal all their presents. Players walk the Grinch left and right, go up and down staircases and chimneys, and duck into nooks to avoid bumping into the dozens of happy, wandering housemates. Why the house is so bustling on Christmas Eve and why the Grinch isn't allowed to bump into people as awake as him makes no sense other than to set up the mediocre gameplay.    Beyond walking, climbing and nabbing presents, there's very little to this game. When a house is cleared of all its goods, the player can exit through the chimney and move onto the next house, identical to the last in every way except its layout. There are only seven levels in the game, and each can be beaten in about five minute so the amount of gaming here is pretty limited. Each level has a minimum number of presents that need to be collected in order to advance, but each level can be revisited later to sweep up any remaining gifts.    The game misses big on recreating the humor and style of either Seuss' book or the Chuck Jones cartoon. Whereas both of those works had the Grinch stealing Christmasy items in meticulous, creative ways, this game is limited to a handful of generic items and the same swooping bag animation each time. It would have been great to really play up the Grinch's stealthy abilities like the cartoon did, which painted him as sort of a masterful thief. Instead he comes off a bit sluggish.   Sneak sneak sneak. The top screen displays a map of the current house, but the only information displayed is the house layout and the player's location. There's no indication of where the humans are, where the remaining presents are or anything else that might have actually been useful. It's like having a treasure map that's just a big square with the word ~sand~ written in it.    Controls are fairly responsive, although the game does suffer from a little Castlevania-itis when it comes to cleanly boarding and exiting staircases. The game's biggest problem though (aside from how boring it is) is that enemies are far too unforgiving and unpredictable for young gamers. When the Grinch collides with some of the enemies, players engage in a touch-control minigame that has the Grinch avoiding them in a new setting for a few seconds. If the Grinch can dodge enough people, no lives are lost. If the Grinch is hit too many times, one of the player's three lives is knocked off. This is a good system because it gives the player a second chance and also breaks up the monotony of the main gameplay.    Unfortunately only a few of the enemies offer such minigames. Most enemies, like a cheerful businessman who seems to be unrelated to the book or film, have no minigame and simply knock off a life every time they bump into the Grinch. If the player loses their three lives, it's game over and the level must be replayed. This is far too merciless for young gamers, but what makes it downright unfair is that the paths of enemies are completely random. Sometimes an enemy will walk the entire span of a hallway, sometimes half the hallway and there's no way to predict this other than getting down there to observe them directly. I found myself constantly stuck in a corner, hoping an enemy would turn before reaching me with no way to predict his actions. That's sloppy design. To be honest, I'm not even sure if the level designers checked the enemy paths for impossibilities, because some of the packages seem unreachable without taking damage. If the enemies all had icons on the map, predicting their movements would have been far easier.    Animation is severely limited with the Grinch recycling the same handful of movements over and over, causing errors like his shadow floating in air as he sneaks down a staircase. Backgrounds are completely bland, with blindingly bare orange walls, grey floors and almost nothing else in each house. Menus have some nice, higher-resolution images of the Grinch and shift backgrounds around playfully, although there's not much content to fill these menus with.Its a shame this game came out so dull and uninspired, given how much charm the source material has. The puzzle mechanic works fine, but its too shallow to support a full DS game. The enemies are unpredictable, the game takes less than an hour to beat and there isnt any variation between the seven levels. This game was obviously thrown together quickly, and is too boring and unfair to recommend to anyone.", "date": "Nov 28, 2007"}
