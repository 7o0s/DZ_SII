So who's going to win this season? Sony or EA? It all depends on the gamer. MLB '99 has all the necessary bells and whistles: updated stats and rosters, create and trade player options,  multiple play modes including exhibition, season, and playoff features, improved graphics -- what could possibly be wrong with MLB '99? It's simple, this game lacks excitement. Whoa, don't shoot me yet, just hear me out.   Without a doubt, Sony's MLB '99 has so many positive qualities that make it totally superior to Triple Play '99 that it's almost unfair to even mention the 'fun-factor' of MLB '99. However, the one thing that EA Sports does a little more successfully than Sony is making their games exciting and Sony has yet to do that with its baseball titles. But in all fairness, though, the game plays just like a PC title, so if you're strictly into simulation-like gameplay, MLB '99 is the way to go.  Looking past that small tangent, MLB '99 has something that most baseball games lack -- a good interface. MLB '99 has one of the tightest batting interfaces. Cursor to cursor batting makes the game more realistic allowing the batter to swing high and low at pitches, as opposed to just timing a swing to a ball.  So the questions is: which one should you buy?  Although MLB '99 looks and plays better, we personally had more fun playing Triple Play '99 simply because the game possesses explosive sounds and animations that make playing videogame baseball a little more exciting, almost arcadey (is that a word?). Better still, MLB '99 is a strong title that would fill anyone's appetite for a baseball game. Ultimately, MLB '99 is the way to go.  PSX Staff", "date": "Apr 15, 1998"}
