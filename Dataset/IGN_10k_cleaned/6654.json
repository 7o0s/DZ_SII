Heck, I remember playing the first Test Drive on my 64K Apple IIe when it was still considered a powerful home computer.  Even then Accolade was able to create an entertaining racer that really captured a sense of speed and excitement.  The original Test Drive spawned four sequels and, in an effort to expand the series, Accolade moved off the blacktop and into the wilderness with Test Drive: Off-Road.  When it made its appearance last year, Off-Road was met by a number of ho-hum reviews and unsatisfied gamers.  Unfortunately for Accolade, the next installment in the Test Drive: Off-Road series offers everything its predecessor did -- poor graphics, incredibly unrealistic physics, and horrible gameplay.     While taking to the backroads in a souped-up 4x4 sounds like a great idea in theory, in reality Test Drive: Off Road 2 is a soulless racer that offers nothing new to the genre. The worst aspect of this game is the amazingly poor physics engine.  The cars move like a 10 ounce sirloin on an air hockey table -- extremely sluggish and sticky.  There is no sense of real speed whatsoever and the cars flip up and down over the rocky terrain never taking one lick of damage or even puncturing a tire.  Where's the sense of realism?  Where's the excitement?  There just isn't any.   Off-Road 2 also fails in the graphics department.  The visuals are so incredibly bland, flat, blocky, and lifeless I actually checked to make sure my Voodoo2 card was still seated correctly in its slot.  After taking apart my system and determining that indeed my Voodoo2 card was connected correctly, I smacked the monitor a few times just in case it was on the fritz.  No such luck.  The graphics really were that bad -- even in 3Dfx.  To make matters worse, Test Drive Off Road 2 suffers from serious clipping problems.  Sometimes you can drive directly through a tree, other times you'll slam into one and flip your vehicle.  Go figure.   Because the entire game takes place on some pretty rough surfaces, speeds rarely top 40 mph.  While this might be nice if there were lots of pretty scenery to look at, it ends up being a real drag. This combined with annoying invisible barriers, linear track design, and some pretty baffling frame rate problems (it's not a very graphics intensive game and the trucks don't move that fast, so why the slowdown?) make Off-Road 2 a damn boring game.  That's right, I said it.  This game is boring.  I like watching mold grow on my shower curtain more than playing Off-Road 2.   There are a total of 12 tracks, so there is a fairly good variety as compared to many of the racers out there.  But, due to its console stylings, you can only pick from four in the beginning of the game.  You'll have to unlock the rest by winning races.  There are 20 different vehicles to choose from (including the Saleen Explorer, Dodge T-Rex, AM General Hummer, and Chenowth DR-2), so Test Drive Off Road 2 does offer plenty of visual variety.  But even if the game included 4000 cars the gameplay and graphics wouldn't be any better, so why bother.  And the cars don't even handle differently from one another ... they just look different.  Jeez!!!  Test Drive: Off-Road 2 is one of the most boring and bland racers I have had the misfortune of playing.  I haven't seen a racer this bad since, well, the first Off-Road.  Like the original, Off-Road 2 is a game that clings desperately to its hefty vehicle and music licenses and it just falls short when it comes to gameplay and graphics.  Trust me, this game offers very little fun and you should avoid it.  If you're looking for a good off road racer look somewhere else ... like in Powerslide's direction.  -- Tal BlevinsTest Drive Off Road is a very underwhelming racer. There's nothing terribly bad about the game (except for the lack of a two-player mode), but it's not that special, either. The game feels a lot like last year's Test Drive 4, with the same floaty control and weird in-air physics. If you pick the right vehicle the game plays fast and intense, but most of the time the trucks just lumber along.The World Tour is a good way to play the game, unfortunately it's a bit redundant because if you run out of time in the third race of a four race circuit, the game ends and you have to start back at the beginning. Very annoying...thankfully you can turn off the Checkpoints so you're not racing against the clock.Timing is everything, and Accolade just beat out Rally Cross 2  its obvious competition. Unfortunately from what we've seen, despite not having any real vehicles Rally Cross 2 is the much better choice for off-road racing.", "date": "Jan 15, 1999"}
