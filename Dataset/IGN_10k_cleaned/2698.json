So when I first booted MacSoft's Civilization: Call to Power up, I was expecting an ambitious game that expanded on Sid Meier's original designs with a few rough edges. Instead, I find a game that vaguely resembles classical Civilization with a lot of rough edges.   Like the first two games in the series, Call to Power is a historical empire-building simulation that takes you from a couple Stone Age villages to the Modern Age and beyond. Develop technologies to evolve, negotiate treaties with neighbors, trade when possible, conquer when not -- age-old philosophies that we love so well. Call to Power is the most ambitious of the three, containing more units, more technologies, more Wonders -- just more of everything in its goal to be the most comprehensive civ-system in existence.   And for the most part, the scope of it works. Gameplay is more concerned with governing a culture, rather than micro managing individual city-states, as Sid Meier's designs. Work hours, science research, unit and building funding are handled globally instead of locally. That means that military units and facilities belong to your empire as a whole, rather than funded locally by each town, which makes developing cities grow a lot faster, since costs are distributed and won't drain small treasuries as fast. Also, revenue can be diverted to the public works system -- a very smart way to deal with building roads, farms, and mines. Instead of micro managing settlers to build each individual tile over a series of turns, you can use public works points to develop your country's infrastructure. Finally, it's got one of the most intuitive and robust trading systems I've ever seen. Trade routes have clear profits and losses, with a trading system that handles everything from monopolies and imports/exports with intuitive graphics and tables. It's features like these that are clear and marked improvements.   As war and conflict are prevalent even in today's world, so are they integral parts in Call to Power. In fact, they're a little too integral. Activision wants you to see all their 65 or so spiffily-designed unit icons, and by golly, you're gonna see them if you like it or not. Diplomacy is a joke. Unlike the real world (or so I hope), nobody likes to negotiate. Where the Russians might have blustered a bit back in the old Civ, they don't even want to talk to you unless you give them everything but the kitchen sink. Make a treaty with anybody, and next thing you know, their units are sidling their way into your territory, merrily mapping out your territory and disrupting trade routes in a cavalier fashion. They want a fight, and unless you want to get nibbled to death, you have to switch to wartime tactics as well. You can't be a Switzerland in this game, and that's unfortunate.   However, for those who believe in eternal vigilance and giving as good as you get, there's more than enough to keep you occupied. There are two ways to wage war: open and subversive. Open war is the classic ~beat your opponent into the ground and take their cities~ approach, which you can do with great versatility. You can group units into stacks of nine, with ranged units and front line units combined. Organization is smart: ranged units take the back row, while melee units take front. War can take place on land, on sea, under the sea, in space. You just need the right units, and the multitude you have to choose from -- phalanx, interceptor, plasma destroyer, leviathan, war walker -- is incredible. A lot of good tactics are possible. The big caveat, though, is that technology advances mean very little in terms of raw strength. An ancient group of phalanxes can take down a squadron of F-15 interceptors because they have comparable offense and defense, which makes no sense whatsoever, since you can bomb them out of existence with no problem.   Subversive warfare expands on the spies and diplomats concept and takes it one step further. Now you've got slavers, televangelists, corporate branches, cyber ninjas, lawyers abolitionists, and many more units involved in sub rosa warfare. These guys are invisible to normal units, and launch attacks that don't destroy cities, but do drain cash and reduce population. My personal favorite is the Corporate Branch, represented by a faceless executive behind a desk, trolling in enemy territory, setting up cash-draining franchises. It's a subtle way to wage war, but it's one that you have to deal with, both because it works on allies as well as enemies, and because the AI loves to use them.   For all its variety and improvements, though, it's marred by incredibly rough gameplay. There are the military and diplomacy problems, which favor world conquest over both the alien life project or surviving to the year 3000 AD. Navigation and production are incompetent. Units don't autocycle in a consistent fashion -- very easy to leave units unmoved, even when they already have destinations. The pathing system is all the time and doesn't center the unit on screen, which leads to a lot of mis-directed units. I don't know how often I've accidentally taken defending units out of my cities, only to have eager barbarians rush in. Production alerts don't take you automatically to the event itself: you've got to click on the message icon, then click on the eye icon, and then select a facility to build. Some messages don't disappear after you've looked at them. Pollution is tucked away in a tab in the administration bar. The production queues leave buildings already in progress on the ~to build~ list, while you have to manually select and remove all items from the queue to change build order. You can create a stack, but let one leave a transport or a carrier, and you have to reorganize. And the list goes on and on. None of these are fatal flaws by themselves, but together, they drain vitality from this game as surely as thousand cuts on a man's body will bleed him to death. Such problems were mostly handled with ease in Civ II, which makes it surprising to find them here.   In the end, Call to Power isn't so much a Civilization game as a turn-based Age of Empires. Instead of an open-ended, multi-tactic empire game, you're guided towards a military, action-based philosophy whether you like it or not, and your technological advances are geared towards that end. The domestic administration features are more of a backdrop than an essential feature, despite the fact that these are the best improvements. The gameplay and interace suffer from this muddled mentality, and that's a shame, because if Activision had gone one route or the other, this could have been a very good game.", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
