We had Suikoden and maybe King's Field and Vandal Hearts and that was about it. Luckily, Sony's homegrown western sci-fi piece, Wild ARMs, eventually came along too, and in an era before the gargantuan Final Fantasy VII created a role-playing renaissance, it was a bona fide blessing. At the time, it had a lot of the features we were looking for: Good graphics, a nice soundtrack, an original setting, and a unique battle system to name but a few. And as you might have guessed, it earned plenty of accolades and sold a bunch of copies as a result, all of which were accomplishments well deserved.   Eight years later, Agetec is attempting to capture that magic once again with the intricately-titled remake, Wild ARMs -- Alter Code: F. But while this effort is certainly a good game that offers a nice amount of fun for nostalgists and newbies alike, it doesn't hold quite the same weight that it used to in today's market filled with a never-ending supply of new RPGs.   Rudy Roughknight has returned! That said, I'll tell you what I do like about Alter Code: F, and that's its dedication to revision. Though the new Wild ARMs is in several ways the same game that it was in 1997, it's different in just as many respects. A revamped graphics engine, an extended and re-translated script, experience point modifiers, additional characters, stat-tracking, and a host of new puzzles and optional areas really push its concept beyond that of a simple remake. Developers Media Vision should really be commended on how well it's managed to balance the original source material with new content so effectively -- there's a little bit for everyone here.   Another thing that Alter Code: F does well (which the first game also excelled at) is tell its story. Following the exploits of Wanderers Rudy Roughknight, Jack Van Burace, and Cecila Lynne Adlehyde, Wild ARMs is your classic tale of a society trying to keep its bad history from repeating itself. Of course, repeat is what history does best and it doesn't take long before our heroes are thrown nose-first into the middle of a battle to save the world. The plot doesn't really offer any twists or turns that RPG veterans or Wild ARMs fans haven't seen before, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for in heart.   If you like classic but personable stories, then this is your game. In fact, Alter Code: F provides some great fan service to the series' devoted followers as it fleshes out all the major players far more than it did before. Gamers will be able to play as a few of their favorite personalities from the PSOne game (in addition to the classic folks mentioned above) as well, and there's enough new stuff for diehards to make it worth checking out.    One of Wild ARMs' biggest advantages over its competition (especially in regards to the first game) has always been its emphasis on puzzles. As most veteran RPG fans can attest, too many role-playing dungeons these days focus on battling it out rather than how you actually arrive at those battles. This is definitely where Alter Code: F gains some ground, though, as practically every dungeon in the world of Filgaia tests your puzzle-solving skills more than your itchy trigger finger. The same approach goes for town exploration too, and if you want to find and do everything possible, you'll have to utilize the returning ~Tool System~ to its fullest.   For the unfamiliar, the tool system is a simple but effective collection of action-based commands that users can exploit uniquely from each character. Rudy, for example, can employ bombs to blow up obstacles and reach areas not previously accessible. Cecilia, on the other hand, can use her magical wand to light torches and activate hidden switches, while Jack can use his talking mouse to crawl into miniature openings to unlock treasure chests. What's more is that each character eventually gains the use of four unique tools as time goes on and the uses for these tools and the puzzles that go along with them become more and more interesting.   Complex the battle system is not. But just because the dungeons are puzzle-heavy doesn't mean that there isn't anything to do while in combat. On the whole, warfare is closer to Wild ARMs 3 than it is the PlayStation original (minus the emphasis on boss battles), but it does retain some prequel roots. The most obvious carry-over from Wild ARMs 3 is the Migrant System, which allows you to avoid random encounters if you don't feel like fighting. Luckily, the CPU keeps you from abusing it by utilizing an onscreen gauge that penalizes you for skipping enemies too much. It's also difficult to recharge later on, further preventing you from using it unless you really need to.   Once the combat begins, the menu system works a lot like the Shining Force or Lufia series with a simple icon-based grid interface that allows for commands such as attack, defend, etc. It never gets too complicated, of course, but it's flexible enough to provide character-specific special attacks, hidden combo moves, and the option to store Force Points for more powerful blows. Sadly, this somewhat generic battle system is where Wild ARMs begins to lose momentum as the need to use Force Points and more powerful attacks are few and far between. This means that a lot of the extra stuff feels like fluffy bells and whistles for most of the game. It also doesn't help matters that the overall difficulty is on the extremely easy side (unless you hit the bonus optional areas, where things finally get tricky).   Expect similarities to Wild ARMs 3... with less dirt. Another area in which Wild ARMs stumbles is with its general approach to character growth. On the plus side, I really like the experience multipliers given to individuals for doing well in battle, but there isn't much else to do with party members beyond level grinding. The Wild ARMs 3-inspired personal skills replace the need to buy and upgrade equipment and evolving ARMs are extremely limited in their potential.    Now in case we haven't made it clear enough yet, Alter Code: F shares a lot in common with Wild ARMs 3 (right down to the need to discover new map locations with your SONAR rather than just walking up to them). But I'm sad to report that one of the last game's best features -- the ASK dialogue system -- was one of the few elements not carried over into the remake. That's particularly strange given the amount of dialogue and story infused into the new project, and I'll admit that I was a bit disappointed in the adventure's resulting linearity (personable as it may be).   It's also hard to ignore that the new Wild ARMs borders on being ugly -- which is almost hard to believe given the last title's stylish cel-shaded visual presentation. This sad fact is mostly attributable to the artist's decision to make the series more realistic by dropping the anime-like designs of the previous titles. The three adjustable camera angles are too far away from the action, too (at the farthest setting, your characters will barely break ~ant~ status rather often), and the environments are flat, simplistic, and uninspired. I might have been a little more forgiving two years ago when the game was released in Japan, but not today.   Here we see the cast talking about the excellent soundtrack... probably Oh, but I do love the soundtrack, though. Inspired by the original PSOne version, the new OST has an abundance of great songs with a decidedly western and sci-fi theme (which, by the way, is what the game is all about). Strangely enough, the voice-overs from the Japanese version weren't translated or ported over for the English version, so there are a few instances where the events feel awkwardly silent, but it's not a huge loss.Despite the fact that this is a two year-old remake of an eight year-old game, Wild ARMs -- Alter: Code F is still surprisingly enjoyable. It's a little linear, a little easy, and a little unattractive, but the characters still have a lot of personality, the dungeons are actually fun to navigate, and there's enough extra content here to keep you busy for quite some time. It's a good starter RPG to be sure, but will probably be best enjoyed by those who remembered their times with the original almost a decade ago.", "date": "Nov 30, 2005"}
