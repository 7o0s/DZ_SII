In the beginning, it was            impossible to have the kind of extensive            stats and realism we've come to expect            from sports games, so the natural            counterpart would have to have been            fantasy-based sports games. BallBlazers,            originally released in 1985 for the old Atari            and Commodore 64 home systems, took            advantage of its lack of reality and            concentrated on the combat and special            weapons. Now, over 10 years later,            LucasArts has decided to update            BallBlazers for the PlayStation. Again,            they've opted to leave out the realism and            have gone for sci-fi combat action, whole            hog.              The game takes place on an asteroid, where            aliens from all over the galaxy have come to            compete in the Intergalactic BallBlazer            Championship. The game itself is somewhat            reminiscent of the old '70s movie Rollerball,            except instead of skating around a rink with            motorcyclists, you pilot a rotofoil, a            smooth-moving one man ship with            numerous offensive and defensive            weapons. Your object is to keep a glowing            ball away from your one opponent long            enough to make a goal.  The idea is simple enough, and worked to great effect on the older systems. However, on the PlayStation it seems to be lacking something. As it's one-on-one, it's easy to get lost in the mammoth arenas, and you end up spending a lot of time just driving around. The game is also somewhat slow, although it does look great.  For fans of the original game, BallBlazer Champions offers a nostalgic update. But for everyone else, stick to the normal sports.
