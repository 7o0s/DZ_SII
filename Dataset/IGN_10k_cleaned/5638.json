Granted much of the music was created virtually (sans real orchestra and choir in favor of electronic manipulation), but all but the most trained of ears would be hard-pressed to distinguish between what is real and what is virtual.    The 34 tracks included on this bonus soundtrack disc run the gamut from storming militaristic cadences to hauntingly quiet percussive interludes. There's a fair amount of ethnic sounds culled from various parts of the world including the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and of course the Mediterranean. Viking like horns dominate some tracks while strange, unidentifiable tribalistic drums float eerily through others. And then there's the voices. Haunting, ethereal voices that hover just out of audible range to create a sonic mist through which the rest of the music creeps and crawls.    If there is one complaint about the disc it's that the transitions between songs are choppy. For example Track 1 builds to a thunderous crescendo and then abruptly ends. And I'm not talking about the kind of controlled, orchestrated abrupt ending. I'm talking about ~the tape ran out~ kind of abrupt ending. This manner of emergency brake stopping between songs continues throughout the duration of the disc at random intervals (such as between Track 2 and 3 and then intermittently throughout the rest of the album) and as a result the continual jarring leaves no set-up or smooth flow from track to track. Rather, it ends up instilling a jagged sense of uncertainty and creates a herky-jerk whiplash blast of uneven aural stimulation for the listener.    Yet within the context of the game, the score is breathtakingly epic, no question about it. And even though the thoroughly uneven transitions between tracks make for an uneven listening experience at best, those who relish well-crafted game scores will find this soundtrack to be quite enthralling. Let's just hope if they decide to give it a wider release that they'll go back and re-engineer the whole shebang, inserting smoother edits and crisper transitions between movements.If you're not yet sold, you likely never will be. Attempting to summarize God of War in this little space also feels like it'd be an injustice, so I'll not even bother trying anymore.Purchase it, rent it, borrow it, whatever it. Just play the game. Just beat the game.", "date": "Mar 26, 2005"}
