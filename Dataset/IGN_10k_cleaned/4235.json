The pop culture behemoth that is American Idol has found its way to the PS2. All of the pop tunes, crazy outfits, and snappy judges have been converted to polygon glory. And by converted to polygon glory I mean that the game American Idol has been shoved onto the PS2 so quickly and thoughtlessly that the only motivation here is to make a quick buck off the franchise rather than make a game of any lasting quality.   Karaoke Revolution just showed us that it is indeed possible to make a karaoke singing game that works well and fun to play, I mean sing. Now, American Idol shows us that an established pop culture name can be used to cover up a game that steals good ideas from Dance Dance Revolution and waters them down to practically nothing. Supposedly, you can sing along to this game, but only in the exact same way as you can sing along with the radio.    Gameplay  As an aspiring singer, the goal is to make it straight to the top of the American Idol charts. Every step of the way, you'll be judged by the three television judges:  Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul. After a couple rounds in the preliminaries it's straight to the TV stage to be judged by all of America.   This all sounds well and good, but the execution leaves a whole world of excitement to be desired. There is no singing ability required and only minimal rhythmic ability. On my first try at the normal level, I managed to get all the way to the end to see the gripping finale, more on that later.   The game itself is a rhythm game reminiscent of Parappa the Rapper, Dance Dance Revolution, or BeatMania. A small circle is in the middle of the screen and four lines point up, down, left and right from it. Each line corresponds to the four buttons on the controller. As the song plays, one of these symbols, like an X or a triangle, will move in to the center along the line. As the symbol gets inside the circle, the corresponding button needs to be pushed.     Sometimes the symbols will be at the front of a bar that moves towards the middle. At this time, the button needs to be held down for the same duration, letting go when the end of the bar reaches the middle. The only other variation is when two buttons, always adjacent and never opposite, move in that need to be pushed together. Do well and occasionally a star symbol will move in along one of the lines. Hit the right button when the star reaches the middle and the crowd will cheer and the TVs on the stage will have a little light show.   In the early stages of competition there is no rhyme or reason to the order of the buttons that need to be pushed. The order isn't related to the song and don't form any patterns. They're done randomly and will often feature a button that needed to be hit when my character wasn't even singing. At first, I tried to keep rhythm with the music like with other rhythm games, but that wasn't helping and only when I just watched for the symbols to enter the inner circle and ignored the music did my score improve.   Later on in the game, a few rhythms are formed by the order of the buttons and some more advanced skill are required. Still, compared to other games in the genre, this is by far one of the easiest I've ever played. It would have been nice if there was more of a reward for doing well like the singer moving around more or things starting to happen in the background like Samba de Amigo. As it is, there are only a few moving symbols and some sparks for being on cue.   There is any on-screen score, just the verdict from the judges at the end of the song. Get enough correct hits and they'll let you move on, but there is no immediate way to tell how your session is going other than trying to keep track in your head of your successful hits. Only after finishing the game and finding a Hall of Fame option did I even find out that there is a score for button-tapping ability. So it is tallied even though during the game it's never on screen.     As for the judges themselves, it's obvious that one of the main selling points is the inclusion of the witty and sarcastic comments by the three judges. It's also obvious that not much work was put into coordinating them. Randy started off one review by saying he didn't like my performance and Paula finished by commenting on how great it was that all three agreed on how good it was. After a previous round where all three liked my singing, the next round of comments had Simon saying, ~well, for once we all agree that we liked it.~ It was almost random.   There were other ways that the comments by the judges were random as well. One judge would love my singing in one round and tear me apart in the next. It was as if they had no memory of what had happened before. The only thing I could depend on was that the negative comment would come first, followed by a positive reinforcement. It was like good cop/bad cop the entire time until I reached the final performances, which is the first time all three started to like my singing ability.   It shouldn't be important, but for the first time ever, my selection of an outfit in a game was crucial. With over 20 wardrobes to choose from and a few dozen combinations in each one, there are tons of ways to mix up the clothes. Make a winning impression and it will help sway the judges as well.   Then again, maybe the wardrobe doesn't have much of an effect after all. I barely paid any attention to the music, put together hideous outfits with Hawaiian prints, and still got to the end and won the hearts of America by popular vote. I got 67% of the vote with one hand tied behind my back. And what did I get for all my efforts? What is the reward for all of this hard work? A screen that says I have superstar potential and a quick boot to the main menu.   What's left after that? Well, there's a karaoke mode where I was able to sing along with the music. It's not that it scored my singing ability or anything, but it would play the music and I could sing at the same time. It's as interactive as a regular CD. Other than that I could play it again or with a friend but there are many other similar games in the genre that deserve much more attention.    Graphics  A cel-shaded character shimmies on stage to the music as symbols move on the screen and occasionally sparks fly and that's about it. There are only four different locations in the main game and I did at least five rounds of singing on the same TV studio stage. Practically no expense was left uncut to make the graphics for this game.   Even worse, there's a huge reliance on badly compressed full-motion video and the same CGI animation of the American Idol logo spinning around. Any time there's a lot of video clips, you know you're in for trouble. Well, this game is trouble through and through.   Sound  Plenty of quips from the judges are included as well as mediocre versions of 40 different songs. It all sounds like it the judges recorded this in a single day and called it quits early in order to cash their checks. That's assuming that it was even recorded for this game because it's likely that it was just taken, like all the live footage, straight from the TV show. The singing is original. Bad, but still original.If you buy this, you've been duped. This game is a quick cash-in and isn't even worth a rental. Save the receipt and return it for Karaoke Revolution. If you want to relive the experience of the TV show, watch some reruns or just sing along with your favorite CDs. Check out Amplitude for some rhythm action or Dance Dance Revolution to see what's been ripped off.", "date": "Nov 20, 2003"}
