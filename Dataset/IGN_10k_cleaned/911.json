There has been many a game that was marginally better on one or the other that it was simply a case of ~the PlayStation version's texture work and colors look better~ and ~the N64 version's models look smoother~. Here, however, it's just a case of the PlayStation version looking like utter shite. The car models are slightly more detailed than large cardboard boxes, and the graphics rank somewhere between an early tech demo and a first-generation PlayStation game. The whole game feels rushed and should never have been released on the PlayStation, at least not in this state.   Gameplay Roadsters is, at its heart, a arcade-style racing game. The control falls somewhere between being very floaty and insanely tight, since the cars turn on a dime, yet often lose their grip rather easily. It's not as floaty as, say, Ridge Racer, but it's bad enough to be annoying. Worst of all, the differences in the cars' control are marginal at best; most of them control the exact same way. Whether you're taking that hairpin in a Alfa Romeo or a Lotus you're going to slam into the wall in pretty much the same place every time.   Roadsters' tracks are simple, and uninspired, for some reason lack some of the more amazing trackside details found in the N64 version. Races can range from incredibly easy to insanely hard, and for no apparent reason at all. I raced the same track 3 times, and placed 3rd, 4th, and 2nd. This wasn't necessarily because of good AI (although the other cars took the corners perfectly), it usually because I spend half the course running into walls. The game moves with a great sense of speed -- when you're actually out in the open. Unfortunately, you'll very rarely get to open 'er up because there are so many stupid corners. Add to that the fact that you'll skid on at last 75% of them, and you've got one of the most aggravating and useless racers on the planet.    Roadsters does have some redeeming value, but most of the plusses are either so mired in crap or so underdeveloped that they're almost not worth including. Weather can play a big part in races, changing the track conditions from dry and easy to drive to wet and bump-fest 2000. There's a slight chance of enjoying yourself when the weather's fair, but as soon as any of the conditions change, you'll quickly find the fun dwindling into nothingness as you kiss wall after wall in your struggle to overtake the 7th place (yeah, this is out of 8).    You can also upgrade your car with some VERY basic elements (engine, turbo, exhaust, gearbox, suspension, and multiple types of tires), but with the exception of the tires, you'll only get one upgrade per car, and there's no way to really see how the upgrades will affect acceleration, horsepower, or handling. Titus managed to license ~cars~ from big name companies like Renault, Alfa Romero, and Fiat, while throwing in many manufacturer look- and sound-alikes to bring the car total to 30, but they all look so similar, you'll have some real problems distinguishing one from the other when you're on the track.    Speaking of tracks, there are 10 of them, ranging from mountain passes to beachfront jaunts, but none of them are all that interesting. When you compound the rather blah tracks with the fact that you're doomed to repeat them in their reverse and mirror guises, a good mental breakdown to avoid dealing with anything else this crapfest throws at you will start to look better and better the more you play it.   But, I haven't mentioned the best part! While most games would opt for an options screen, Titus apparently doesn't think gamers will need one, and have completely omitted any sort of options menu. Don't like those weather effects turned on, seeing as how they keep you plastered to the wall half the time? Too bad, you don't get to turn them off! Think the AI is a little too strong? Deal with it, Titus says you'll play it and you'll like it! I think not.   Graphics It's so very, very rare that I utter these words, but I'm going to say them. The N64 version of this game looks better. MUCH better. It's so much better, in fact, that I'm actually tempted to question the reason as to why the PlayStation version was even thought up in the first place. There's no way in hell this game was given in a smidgeon of the amount of time that was spent working on the Dreamcast or N64 versions, and one look at the graphics proves it.    This game is ugly. Damn ugly. The textures are something I'd usually associate with some that I regurgitated after a good long night of drinking, but they lack the same range in colors. For the most part, your can almost excuse the lackluster, grainy texture work that plagues the daytime or fair weather parts of the course, but as soon as it takes a dip into the rainy laps, you're in for some eye-bleedingly bad color palettes. The sky, for instance, becomes a wonderful example of what happens when you try to paint a gradient with about seven colors. Massive banding and dithering are blindingly apparent, and this wouldn't be as noticeable (Gran Turismo 2 suffers from a slightly less severe problem) if the sky wasn't so readily apparent right before almost entire screenfuls of track pop onto the screen.   Ah yes, the popup. Horrible, horrible popup and pop through are so bad, that you'll often see the entire screen being painted with the next corner of the track. I'm not talking small details on the horizon; I'm talking about the whole horizon, plus hills and the bend in your path, suddenly appearing out of nowhere. It's inexcusable, and shows yet again, that next to no effort was spent on bringing this game to the PlayStation.   The car models are yet another shining example of the crap that awaits you upon injection into the racetrack. All of them, whether coupe or convertible, look like they were crafted from large rectangles of metal, and then rounded off till they remotely resembled something that would be drivable. These are seriously the worst car models I've ever seen in a racing game, and I've seen a LOT of racing games.   The only positive thing I could find about Roadsters' graphics was the framerate. It's kept at a constant 30 fps, but given that we're dealing with soapbox racers and ho-hum track designs, that better be the case. I managed to choke the bile down for a good weekend of playing time, and never once met up with a case of slowdown.    Sound Why break with a trend of crappiness?  Roadsters' effects were sampled at what sounds like about the lowest the PlayStation will handle. All the comments from the drivers are so muddled and flat that it is impossible to tell what they're saying. This is partially because the music and ~engine roar~ are drowning it out, and thanks to the wonderful decision to leave out an options menu, you'll never get the chance to change it.  The sound balance is so, bad; in fact, that all you'll hear 90% of the time is your car's engine. Not the skidding of tires, not the crunch of gravel, just reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer the entire time. About the only think you'll hear other then the engine is a rubbery thud as your car smacks a wall, guardrail, or other car. The effects here are horrible.   Likewise, the music is dull, flat, and horribly uninspired. Simple drum loops, guitar wails and power chords, and ambient effects do not equal music, but whoever this game's composer is, they apparently believe they do, because you'll get a healthy dose of all of them as you play -- that is, if you can hear them, which you won't most of the time.  There are six words that best sum up Roadsters: avoid this game at ALL costs. There is absolutely no redeeming value in this hunk of plastic, and God help the poor soul that actually dishes out the cash to play this game.", "date": "May 2, 2000"}
