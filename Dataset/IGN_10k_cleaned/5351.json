Here it is, almost December, and there's not a lick of hockey on television anywhere. No matter how you feel about the financial wrangling that's keeping ice arenas dark, one thing is for certain: you need a fix. You need to see somebody -- anybody -- checked into the glass. You need to see a miracle shot bank off the goalie into the net. You need to see a knock-down fight between two hulking players over a rough play.   You need to play NHL 5-on-5 Hockey.   Features:   All 30 NHL teams  5-on-5 action  Hard hits vibrate your phone   Now, if you're a real hockey fan, you're getting your fullest fix from SEGA and Electronic Arts' console hockey contests which feature detailed polygonal players checking each other at 40 mph. But you can't take those glorious games on the road, and that's where THQ Wireless' NHL 5-on-5 Hockey becomes essential for fans.   If anything, NHL 5-on-5 Hockey will remind you of some of the better EA hockey games available on the Genesis from years back. It's not as detailed, but the essence of the action is there -- and that's worth the few bucks to download it.   There is some debate over whether or not full licenses are necessary for mobile sports games, but in the case of this darkened hockey season, it is absolutely essential. NHL 5-on-5 Hockey features all 30 NHL teams, complete with full rosters, stats, and uniform designs. Since you ain't gonna see them on your television anytime soon, you might as well see the Red Wings play on your handset.   As the title implies, this game features the full ten players on the ice. Thanks to the smaller real estate of a cell screen, this means things can get both a little crowded and a lot hectic. Without good control, NHL 5-on-5 Hockey would capsize, but THQ Wireless has developed a simple system of control that makes it easy to manage your full squad. The number pad -- or the thumbpad -- controls movement, save for the ~5~ or action key, which shoots the puck. The ~*~ changes lines when the puck is in your opponent's half of the ice. ~0~ passes the puck and ~#~ gives your player a quick speed boost for executing powerful plays.   And, of course, there are fights. These days, it's just not a hockey game without a brawl or two. When it comes to blows with your opponent, you switch to simple fighting system that uses ~2~ to punch and ~3~ to block. The key to winning fights is to throw a punch right after the computer, who will often not have the nerves to block in time.   NHL 5-on-5 Hockey moves at a pretty decent clip. Your players can get up a good head of steam and if you steer into another player while you don't have the puck, you can use the shoot button to check him. If you're close to a wall, you can do some real damage. And should you get checked, expect to feel it. THQ Wireless has programmed the game to vibe your phone when you get slammed.   Now, there is one thing missing from NHL 5-on-5 Hockey that would put it absolutely over-the-top. The game is missing a Season Mode leading up to the Stanley Cup. THQ Wireless says memory restrictions prevented the implementation of the feature, but other sports games seem to manage.   NHL 5-on-5 Hockey has a reasonable amount of detail for having so many players on the ice. The rink is a cool blue and the uniform colors are right. What maters moe, though, is the speed of play. While not as fast as a console game -- which nobody expects just yet -- the game moves at an appropriately brisk pace.I don't know where you stand on the whole hockey debacle right now, but if you need to work out your aggressions on the ice, NHL 5-on-5 Hockey is a good download. The game will remind you of some of the classic hockey contests on 8-bit/16-bit consoles. Thanks to the limitations of handsets, there's no way to angle shots (multiple button inputs are still verboten on this gen of phones), but that doesn't make the game any less playable.I'm looking forward to seeing how NHL 5-on-5 Hockey stacks up against the other hockey games moving into their final development phases right now. Considering that competition bred a solid suite of football games, hockey fans might just have just enough go-go hockey action to forget about salary squabbling and enjoy the sport on their own time.", "date": "Nov 25, 2004"}
