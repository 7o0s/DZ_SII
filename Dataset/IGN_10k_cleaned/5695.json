But addicts of the oeuvre that delve deeper than cover-story gaming know if the hidden gem that is   Ys. The story of youthful hero Adol has thrilled traditional RPG fans for a long, long time (hell, I played the crap out of on the Sega Master System), and with mobile phone now approximating the power of 8-bit systems and beyond, Hudson has resurrected the series for some on-the-go swashbuckling.   Ys, however, is a niche game for a reason. It's an acquired taste. And if this is your introduction to the series, you may wonder why we're recommending it so much. But if you stick to it and get out of the totally off-putting text driven opening sequence in town, you will find much enjoyment in entering the field and bashing the snot out of hordes of monsters and bad men.   Starting off in the town may have been true to the game, but it was a mistake for mobile. Before you see a single deathblow, you have to buy stuff, equip items, and talk to people. That's not going to fly with a lot of players anymore. But please, please, please stick with it. Remember how you had to sit through that droning opening sequence in ~Magnolia~ before you got to see Tom Cruise talk about naughty sauce? It's that kind of work/reward equation.   Once you are in the field, Ys comes alive. You do not challenge monsters to turn-based battles like a standard RPG. Instead, you run into them since your sword is forever outstretched. Clashing face first into a monster is suicide. Instead, you have to come at them from angles or the rear. Touch, back off, touch, back off and you will score-- just like prom.   There is a lot of content in Ys -- lots of real estate full of increasingly smart and tough beasts that can only be defeated if you keep on your arsenal like a hawk. If a new weapon is available, you better get it because your foes show no mercy. Ys could stand to be a little kinder to newcomers, though. Items and quests are not as defined as they should be. Progress for the un-initiated will be trying at times, but as mentioned, stick with it.   Ys features a wonderful soundtrack (the series always has), but since many handsets cannot play multiple channels of sound, you have a choice to make. Will you listen to the looping score? Or opt for battle-weary sound effects? The graphics are also very good -- we tested it on an LG VX7000 -- and found it to be a good approximation of the classic game. Master System perfect? No, but close enough for now.Ys is a good RPG for genre fans that want to take their high adventure on the highway. It is definitely not everybody cup o' grog, though. Fans of the new breed of RPGs will likely kick it to the curb, it's no Final Fantasy MXCVII-4 with eighty minute spellcasting animations. This is good, traditional RPG fun and I had a great time with it. If you have the time (maybe a crappy morning train ride), Ys will keep you glued -- and keep the guy next to you from talking your ear off.", "date": "Apr 21, 2005"}
