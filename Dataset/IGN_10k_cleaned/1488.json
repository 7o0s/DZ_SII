{"name": "Die Hard Trilogy", "name_review": "Die Hard Trilogy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/die-hard-trilogy", "text": "Usually when you get multiple games packed into one CD, it feels like a ~bargain basement~ kind of thing. If you get one good game out of the bunch, you're lucky. Not the case with Die Hard Trilogy. This is one of the best games you can buy for the PlayStation, and the fact that there's actually three games makes it all the better.  The first game is the most dense, and possibly the best of the three. You move through the Nakatomi Plaza building, with the camera presenting everything isometrically. Your job is to free the hostages and blow away the terrorists. Along the way you pick up armor and weapons. The second game is best played with a light gun. You move through the airport, blasting enemies (and innocent bystanders) as you go. The third game puts you in a taxi, driving through New York City.  The attention to detail in Die Hard Trilogy is superb. Anything and everything can be shot and blown up, and the explosions are breath-taking. There's also bucket-loads of gore. While they may get a lot of flack for it, it truly is fun driving through Manhattan and running over as many pedestrians as possible.  Some will argue that Die Hard is nothing but pure action, and they're right. But that's what makes it so much fun. Like the movies, it's one adrenaline-pumping sequence after another.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
