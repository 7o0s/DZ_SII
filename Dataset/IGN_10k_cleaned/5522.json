Atlus is more known for its quirky Japanese imports, but it's taking a bit more of a risk bringing this French-developed, non-branded action game stateside. Thankfully the game inside the package is much more original than its namesake, or at the very least it's not something that's standard action fare on the Game Boy Advance. It's not quite the classic as the two old-school games that inspired it, but its game and level designs offer some really good action and strategy -- just be prepared for a little frustration along the way.  The war in Super Army Wars is pretty nondescript, more a generic representation of the US versus some other faction (represented with a Red and White triangular flag). In each of the 16 missions, the task is to assist your army into marching from the right side of the map to the left, keeping their forces strong so they can take out the enemy's fortress at the end of the line. To do this, you'll have to combat either a chopper, bomber, or jet (depending on the mission at hand), and take out the enemy's air and ground forces to keep them moving forward. Along the way, foot troops can secure neutral forts that will increase your army's funds and enable you to purchase additional tanks, jeeps, and foot soldiers that will keep the forces strong.  Even though Super Army Wars is essentially a side-scrolling action game, there's a ton of strategy involved in the game design. It's not a mindless task getting your army to the other side of the enemy terrain because it's all in how your army's organized. Early in the game the ~purchase~ of troops is handled automatically. It's important to have tanks in front of foot soldiers and jeeps to protect them in order to secure neutral forts -- soldiers are the only ones that can grab these forts to increase funds. So it's important to keep an eye on the upper RADAR that tracks your army's forward progress, since most of the game involves returning to base in order to repair the craft as well as restock some of the more powerful weapons. And on occasion, sometimes it's a good idea to set up for a sacrificial ~kamikaze~ run when low on armor; slamming your aircraft into the ground can do some serious damage to the enemy's approaching army. Of course, there's friendly fire in Super Army Wars, which means it's easy to accidentally hurt your own army with your own firepower. And if you down an enemy plane or helicopter right on top of your own army, that could potentially be the difference between winning or losing a mission.  The fact that the game jumps around to put you in different situations and vehicles gives Super Army Wars a lot of variety. Helicopters handle much differently than the planes and offer different control. In a helicopter, you can pick up and drop off foot soldiers in order to secure forts deeper in enemy territory. Planes are faster but less maneuverable, but allow you to hit ground targets much more accurately. And in deeper missions, you'll actually have to take control over the army's finances, buying and organizing the army that will march on to victory or defeat depending on how you plan ahead and protect them. Super Army Wars isn't just inspired by two classic Apple II games...it rips them off wholesale. This Neko Entertainment-designed GBA game lifts the designs of the Broderbund classic Wings of Fury as well as Epyx Rescue Raiders, which was ultimately inspired by the truly classic Choplifter. Super Army Wars takes these two concepts and mushes them together to create a new game for the GBA. It's clear that the game designer was a huge fan of both games, because much of what made both Wings of Fury and Rescue Raiders great action games back in the day has been retained in the move to the handheld. And considering how awesome the original material was back in the day, it's not exactly bad to lift its theme off these two games.  But there are a few missed opportunities in the Game Boy Advance recreation of the game's designs. Half the fun of Rescue Raiders, for example, was taunting the enemy to fire a heat-seeking missile, and attempting to outrun it over enemy troops; time it properly and the missile would lose fuel and land -- devastatingly -- right on top of the bad guy's army. In Super Army Wars, the vehicle that fires missiles simply blasts projectiles when you get too close to the enemy. And in a game where it's equal strength armies against each other, the fact that it lacks a two player head-to-head option is more than just a little disappointing; nearly ten years ago a PC publisher produced Armor Alley, a LAN-version of Rescue Raiders. And it was fun as hell. Something like that is really missing in Super Army Wars.  The fact that you can take out ally aircraft in a dogfight also makes the game slightly more frustrating. Since the action literally takes place on a single 2D scrolling background, ally helicopters and enemy helicopters can overlap if they're flying in the same direction; and since your bullets don't discriminate between ally and enemy, you can accidentally bring down your own guys while trying to target the enemy craft. I guess it was a design choice that had its pros and cons, but there's a lot more opportunities for frustration because of it. The last time a game like this was available for a game system was in the Game Boy Color port of Wings of Fury released several years ago. If you're not familiar with that game or Rescue Raiders, Super Army Wars will feel like an entirely new experience. Its unique blend of side-scrolling shooter action and strategic resource management really makes this game feel like an original design...even though it's really a game that's been done nearly two decades ago. It could have used just a little more attention in the game balancing, and it really screams for a two player head-to-head mode, but Super Army Wars is a surprisingly fun, challenging, and -- if you've never played the original Apple II games -- unique GBA experience that's well worth the 20 dollar price tag.", "date": "Feb 24, 2005"}
