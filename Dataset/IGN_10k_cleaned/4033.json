{"name": "SSX 3", "name_review": "SSX 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/18/ssx-3-2", "text": "When one looks around at the freight train of games with 2s and 3s (or even X-2s) attached to them in 2003, it seems this year could easily be dubbed ~The Year of the Sequel.~ This leads one to believe the titles of 2003 are more of the same -- same concept, more levels, extra widgets, colored goatees, etc. This is true to a certain extent. But there are two things these short-sided, surface-skimmers are missing: 1) If it's a sequel, than the first one was good enough to warrant making a make second; and 2) this is perhaps the best year of sequels in the history of videogames.    So, with SSX 3, the third in EA's snowcross series, the company's Canadian development team took the notion of sequels very seriously. SSX Tricky was at various times in its development SSX 1.5, SSX DVD, and more, but it eventually became a fully-fledged game all its own. So, it was little confusing.   There should be no confusion this year. EA's let's-wipe-the-slate-clean perspective is apparent in every powdery hill, in each of the mountain's three enormous peaks, in the characters' silky smooth animations, and in the gargantuan level of new tricks, entirely new levels, and superb graphic effects that have been carefully crafted to ensure that in 2003, the self-effacing titled SSX 3 would speak volumes. And boy, does it. The newly formed blister on my right thumb, that lovely sense of bewilderment at having spent too many nights awake late playing it, and my oh-so-patient wife are witnesses to them all.    Opened  SSX 3 is the kind of game you both know and one that, well, you really don't. If you've had the pleasure of playing the first two, then you know SSX was the original EA BIG title, a snowcross game bolstered with finely tuned tricks and displaying a bewildering arcade of wild, over-the-top level designs, essentially taking the snowboard mantle from the loveable 1080 Degrees Snowboarding as the snowboard champ. It's an arcade snowboarding game, offering an equal blend of trick and racing courses, and now, since everything is connected and open, there's great freedom to indulge in even more.    Head-to-Head Comparison! Don't know which version of SSX 3 to buy? We tell you in this point-by-point breakdown, which details the differences between the three consoles versions with side-by-side screenshots.  But since when are still screens enough? How about a lengthy, high-res video comparison? Must see!  Text Version | Video Version   You'll notice that the open design idea so well presented in Grand Theft Auto III has filtered into SSX 3. From Amped (the first snowboarding game to offer this) to Jak II to next year's Spider-Man, they're all opening up. In SSX 3, it's not just cool to seamlessly explore the mountain because of the simple fact that you can, but it leads to greater possibilities. It permits you to whimsically, emotionally, or logically decide what to do and when to do it.   As opposed to creating yet another game with a loosely attached series of hills, new wacky characters and humanly impossible tricks, EA wanted unity. SSX 3 takes an entire geographic region (albeit a fictional one) and delivers a figurative and literal mountain. To give you a meaningful perspective of this surface area, there are three peaks, each with roughly five to 10 proper ~courses,~ but every inch of the mountain can be slashed and shredded. All of the surfaces in between the courses are rideable; they're designed - replete with trees and park benches to rail, little jumps to search out -- as such. It's not something that smacks you in the face, like ~Hey, check out my shiny new lipstick,~ it's more subtle. You absorb it, and, as you progress, the enormousness of the game makes its impression.     For example, players can race from the top to the bottom of the mountain in a single, pure and enfettered run. Granted, it takes about 30 gametime minutes to do so, but you CAN do it. The amazing thing is that if you're good (and maniacal) enough, you can actually create a single combo that lasts from the top to the bottom of the mountain (as executed by one crazy EA Canada tester). At which point you'll either explode or collapse. Either way, we're not telling.   If the singular mountain concept expands SSX 3, one new set of tricks unites it. Board presses, the snowboard equivalent to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater's manuals, combine tricks for huge combo tallies. Easily enacted by moving the right analog button forward or backward, players can link trick after trick in any course and, if they are so inclined, they can link a giant combo for one entire run, or like I said earlier, for the entire mountain.   In a fanciful ode to Star Trek's communicators, EA gives players a magical PDA to transport them from any spot on the mountain to any other locale. You can transport to the top of any opened peak, the beginning of any run, to a lodge, check messages from other racers, and more. It makes getting from point A to point B very convenient, very quick. But instant transport to the top of Peak 3 doesn't happen right away of course, EA isn't stupid. It makes you work for those peaks, those new clothes, songs, attributes and hundreds of other collectibles.     Course Design  Players start off with four game modes, all tied together in one way or another: Single Event, Conquer the Mountain, Multi Play, and Online (for PS2 owners). Single Event should be familiar; it's an Arcade mode, permitting players to play any race they've opened. Multi play enables two people to vie on any opened course. And Online play is a first for the SSX series, giving gamers the chance to vie online using a USB headset on any opened course in the game (I'll go into further details later). Conquer the Mountain is the core of the title, the keystone to unlocking the ultimate snowcross bliss.    In every mode, players start with Peak 1, the beginner section. It offers three Race courses and four Slopestyle courses, plus all of the surface areas, BIG Challenges, and extra Rival challenges in between. These are classic SSX-style courses in that they're varied, over-the-top and large. The Peak 1 courses are excellent, really, really excellent. Even when I beat the Peak and moved on to Peak 2 and 3, I just kept going back to these courses, some of the best in the game.   I have a love affair with R&B because of its purity. And Metro City is one of those city courses, mixing urban and mountain elements that I hated at first. It was hard, in fact, very tough for the first peak, but as I built my skills, it became one of the strongest of the Peak 1 challenges. I'm still finding new lines, new extras and ways to play it and it's become another favorite. The Peak 1 courses are easy and accessible enough to train on and build your skills, but they're open, inventive and fun enough to return to when you've mastered the sport.   While EA Big has built a reputation in this series for fantastical, pinball-style courses in the first and second games, one of the biggest changes in course design for SSX 3 is that it's tempered those Looney Tunes-style leanings with fewer unrealistic constructs, replacing them with more realistic, more organic replacements. The results are manifest in Peak 2 and Peak 3.    You wish you could do a handstand -- let alone on a snowboard. Peak 2 is where you'll first feel like you're in the wilderness, the rough wilderness. It's the first time the wind is strong, so strong in fact that you'll have to fight against it to go downhill. The courses reflect the natural beauty of the experience with waterfalls, dense forests, icy tunnels, underground passageways and frightening drop-offs. This set of courses gives players more of a challenge in both racing and slopestyle, prompting more use of multipliers, linked tricks and stretching newfound limits in the Big Air events.      Peak 3 is a monster. The upper region of the mountain is prone to cracks, so chasms open as you're racing through or across them. Narrow mountain trails necessitate careful racing, because you'll fall to your death with one minor slip up. This course is a hardcore's gamer's fantasy, requiring much practice on the racing sections and an amply set of honed skills to link tricks, target multipliers in mid-air and nail the man-made rails.    In all, SSX 3's courses are larger in size -- length, width and depth -- than SSX Tricky. Like before, racing courses take several minutes to finish, though assuredly, you won't see half the course the first time down. It takes several runs including mistakes, exploration, experimentation, and, most of all, time to see each one to its fullest. Likewise, in any of the courses, the sheer volume of rail lines -- be they man-made houses, glassy rails, or giant adverts -- is overwhelming. And then there are the side-courses, short-cuts and off-course tracts to scour. Sheesh.   Old Dog, New Tricks  SSX Tricky gave us tricks, lots and lots of them. In it, gamers were introduced to Ubers and Supers, insanely cool tricks often freeing riders' feet from their straps. SSX 3 takes tricks past that.    In its expansion from Ubers, EA Canada gives us three levels of Ubers. A vertical meter on the right side of the screen indicates built up tricks and once it turns yellow, players can them spell out the words SUPER and UBER. Each tier gives players higher point possibilities and tricks to pull off. The system works perfectly. The meter is timed so that when you fail to continue performing tricks, it only drops down a tier or in small chunks, so you have the chance to make up for the mistake. And players can buy new tricks to add to their repertoire to make things more interesting.    Another major addition to the trick set is the Board Press. EA has fallen in love with the right analog stick (NBA Live, Madden, FIFA, etc.) and now, in SSX 3, players get to use it fully. These Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-like manuals make playing SSX 3 an entirely new game. You can spin during a press, and you can Press from the nose or from the tail. What I especially like is that there isn't a meter indicating your balance. The rider's animation or his voice tells you if balance is an issue.   And then there is the Handplant. Seems like I've done a million Handplants in my life in skateboarding games. But not in a snowboarding title. Handplants are more subtle, not likely to be used in racing events. They do make the game more like a platformer in that they're crucial in getting characters from one construct to another. For instance, you can Handplant from a rail to get to another rail. More importantly, the handplant links you from a lower level half pipe to an upper floor pipe. It's all very subtle and not necessary to enjoying the game, but these make a huge change in how you can play it.    Other little things pull the huge game together. Multipliers, money flakes, point crystals and seemingly hundreds of other things connect things. Multipliers are the biggy for linking tricks, and after combing through a course a few times, players can locate and nail these for bragging rights. They're crucial. The money flakes (not their correct name) are little snowflakes that players can simply find on any course and they're the equivalent of cash, needed to bolster your character profile as the courses get harder.    Pulling off these moves is a pleasure on PlayStation 2; after all, SSX was originally designed for this platform. And while EA has done a commendable job of adapting the configuration to work with Xbox and GameCube, both still feel less refined and intuitive. GameCube in particular takes a hit because it lacks the four shoulder buttons required to execute all the moves in the game, and so EA has made sacrifices in regard to how the layout works and what it is possible.     Talk about opening it up. All of a sudden, with the new Ubers, the presses and the handplants, SSX 3 is a frickin' freestyle game, a linking, combo-making machine, and it's such a full, complete thing, it's so much bigger than it initially seems, it's almost criminal.   Oh, a few other noteworthy things. By pressing the jump button in mid-air the onscreen character quickly recovers from a bail. And for those who like to fight, players can use the shoulder buttons to punch and to block. You'll have to anticipate a block to use it correctly, but it does work well.   Stylized  Customization is the spice of life they say, or some such nonsense. And EA has give players a world of customization. First, six of the original characters, including Mac, Elise, Zoe, Moby, Psymon, and our favorite, Kaori, return. Joining them are Viggo, Nate, Griff, and Allegra. Viggo is a slyish Swede; Nate is a mountain man; Griff is a 12 year-old snowboarding prodigy who loves sugar, and Allegra is a new female character worth looking at for long periods of time. Heh.   With each, players can unlock enormous quantities of stuff. From headgear, hair styles, jackets, pants, boots, various kinds of boards, sunglasses and hand items (such as a soaker gun, for instance), players either unlock or buy these things to make their player their own. The new boards do NOT affect gameplay, nor do any of the clothes. Changes to the player's abilities must be bought.    To increase your snowboarder's stats, players must earn money. Take first place, earn lots of money. Take a bronze or a silver medal you earn less. Finding little snowflakes is like finding $2,000, so exploring the landscape is useful and profitable. In the lodges of each Peak, players can enter in and dress up their character. The list of stuff to play with is immense, although the level of minute detail isn't as profound as The Sims or Tiger Woods.     Nit-Picking  The biggest problems with SSX 3 are the same problems the game has always had. But for the record, they have been so minimalized and the plusses here are so much greater, these little annoyances seem almost like nit-picking. Wait a second... isn't nit-picking my job?    So yeah... You will find places where your character just gets stuck. There are these little wedges between buildings, closely knit trees, boulders, what-have-you, and you will get stuck. The game recognizes these dilemmas most of the time and transports you out, but it still happens. Players can press a button (i.e. Select on PS2) to manually do the same thing. Also, there are locations where players will get bounced like a ping-pong ball, creating a huge waste of time trying to escape. Time spent playing eliminates these problems, but I can only imagine the designers quietly chuckling at newbies when they find these ill-conceived places.    Likewise, players never really know the difference between exploring a new area and lunging to their death. Why did EA want to do this to us? Perhaps it's because the designers wanted to let gamers fid out on their own and play the game over and over again like they did (for two years), but at some point it seems only logical to place a sign on a mountain side indicating ~Danger, deadly dropoff, broken legs, cracked skulls and stuff.~     Rails. There were numerous times when I so desperately wanted to jump onto a rail that I initially missed from the side, but they're surprisingly high, eliminating that notion. But it seems like these man-made constructs, which look like snaking, brightly colored silly straws should be lowered to provide a second chance. Oh well.    Like I was saying, these are little nitpicking things that mean very little in the overall picture. The game is a phenomenally huge, entirely impressive, incredibly polished, and a finely crafted piece of software. More games should be like this. Frickin' nit-picker.   Graphics  You know, looking at Neversoft's Tony Hawk's Underground and comparing it to SSX 3 is like looking at the world through two entirely different lenses. The Tony Hawk series has always used hard lines, gritty, street-wise characters and a rough graphic paintbrush for its world -- naturally reflecting skateboarding culture. EA's game, on the other hand, depicts its world with softer strokes. The characters of SSX 3 are soft-looking, not lame or empty looking, but softer edged, smoother, more polished. There is a little bit of a generic feel to them, and they're a little homogenized.   What genuinely lifts these characters into a different stratosphere, however, are their animations. SSX Tricky and SSX before it delivered smooth animations, but this game surprises you. The characters flow in a constant state of fluid motion. It's surprising because their move set is so huge, the connections between any move into another is so seamless, and they, and their boards, give off this uniquely flexible, elastic quality that it's a real treat to just sit and watch the game being played. The animations are just stunning.    Creating a great sense of weather and environment, EA Canada once again ups the ante with a huge list of graphic additions and improvements. I can't list them all, but sunlight, fog and snowflakes in mid-air and those silly little ones hitting the ~screen~ all have their effect. Sunlight streams through the forest, it reflects off snow, and there are various times of day and night in which to play the game. Dozens of snow colors and types were created to provide a wide range of whiteness and a palette's worth of blues and purples. Additionally, 30 types of snow styles are used in the game creating more realistic powder, and better looking ice (which uses a similar shiny reflective texture to the one seen in NFSU).    Despite the massive levels, there simply is no pop up. The vistas, just like in the previous iterations, are enormous, beautiful and effective. And the many, many cut scenes show off the art and production team's enormous talent for movie-like visuals. All of these effects look great on Xbox and GameCube, and happily, I can report they look almost equally as good on PS2.   Equally satisfying are the short load times. Perhaps the load times are normal, like 15-30 seconds, but I don't care. And I don't because most of them are genuinely short, while the long ones give me something to look at while waiting. A simple little scene of snow passes across the screen, while the informational load screen tells me exactly how fast the data is being loaded. The effect is that I feel like something is happening even though I'm doing nothing. Nice trick!    Sound  Something that's always been satisfying in the SSX series is high production music and sound effects. From the first grooving menu track, the music selection is sharp. From the coolly implemented DJ-smooth Radio BIG to the enormous list of licensed artists in the game, SSX 3 is a festival of sonic excellence. To bolster that, SSX 3 is a legitimate THX endorsed game, ensuring high quality sound clarity.    EA Canada has opted for a series of licensed artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, and N.E.R.D. But there are dozens of other significant ones, including Jane's Addiction (Hypersonic), Swollen Members (All Night), Red Hot Chili Peppers (their rendition of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground), Chemical Brothers (Leave Home) and many others.    Honestly? I enjoyed it all. I'm not generally too picky about music in games. I eventually even liked Britney's songs on Britney's Dance Beat after listening to them 20 million times (a low point in my life, I admit). But at least a dozen songs here caught my attention. Just as I enjoyed watching the animations, I enjoyed listening to whatever EA dropped down in that particular course.    Like everything else in this game, the music choices are huge. In options you can select Big Mountain Ambience if you like it quiet; Radio BIG, which is the ongoing real-time radio with DJ; or you can select an editable list (with or without a DJ) of with songs you've bought.    And even though I'm not a big fan of the character banter (because it's the only thing in the game that's not genuinely ~cool~), the amount of chatter is good. In other words, these characters have a long list of rebuttals and one-liners, and thankfully, they don't talk too much anyway.   SSX 3: The Soundtrack As a stand alone CD, SSX 3: The Soundtrack serves up a choice selection of mid to up-tempo electronically bent jammies ranging from such seminal artists as Fatboy Slim and The Chemical Brothers to such underground stalwarts as Swollen Members and left-of-center favorites like The Faint and Royksopp. For the most part the album is a collection of previously released tracks, however there are two never before released joints, plus a couple of spanking crisp remixes to sweeten the mix. When I started seriously playing this game, I knew I liked SSX 3. But I didn't love it and I wasn't sure I was going to. With so many games to review and play all the time, I have to be picky and even then many games slide right by. But I grabbed this game from Kaiser and for the last week have played it non-stop. Much to my delight, I do indeed love it. Honestly, what is there not to adore about it? All of the new features are significant yet very subtly implemented ones. The board presses turn this game into a freestyle, line-heavy trick-a-thon. The handplants literally enable players to get to new heights. And the triple tier Ubers shove SSX 3 once again into the top list of most desirable extreme sports games on the planet. But I shouldn't be saying that. It just sounds like hype. Rather than just pump this game up, let me put things plainly. SSX 3 expands upon Tricky in every way and then plants the whole game into a cohesive mountain that's rideable from top to bottom. It is better looking, better on the ears, and far deeper upfront and in the long run than its predecessors. From my perspective (someone who loves extreme sports games and has always liked the 1080 series), this is best snowboarding game I ever played. It's arcade-centric, trick heavy, and on the third peak, it's brutal, but in the end, nothing comes close to SSX 3.", "date": "Oct 18, 2003"}
