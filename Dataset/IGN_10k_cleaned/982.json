Gekido is the latest game that tries to bring this venerable genre into the 3D realm and possibly back into the spotlight.   Gameplay  Gekido's main play mode is the story mode called Urban Fighters. In this mode, players are introduced to classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up action in a partially 3D world. If you've ever played games like Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, or more recently, Fighting Force, the basic mechanics of the game will seem fairly familiar -- you're given a bunch of enemies to fight and once you defeat all of them you're allowed to proceed to the next screen to the left or right. The game's just a constant barrage of enemy after enemy.   In the continuous encounters with the adversaries, the player have various ways to attack them including punches, kicks, throws, special moves, and weapons. The weapons can be picked up from off of the ground or knocked out of the hands of an enemy and picked up -- they include machine guns, shotguns, handguns, and other nifty little weapons of destruction. Additionally, players can pick up a variety of different background objects, such as crates, trashcans, and tires, all of which can be used as projectile weapons against their foes. Certain characters can even pick up large objects like automobiles and use them against the bad guys.   What's more, there are a great deal of different combos and special attacks that can be learned while playing the game. The moves are performed by pressing a different combination of buttons in a similar fashion to most of today's 3D fighting games.    The problem with the game is that despite all of the weapons, interactive background elements, and move combinations that are possible, there's not really that much depth to the game. Most players will be able to get through the game by using just a very limited set of moves. Because of this, the game can get very repetitive and somewhat boring. And while there are some different level layouts based on the character that you've chosen, it all really ends up being a game of battling a group of enemies moving a few feet, battling another group, move a few feet, and repeat.   On the plus side, Gekido does offer two-player cooperative play, which is a rarity in today's games. This doesn't miraculously increase the fighting engine's depth, there's just something that's rewarding about fighting an onslaught of attackers with a friend at your side. More developers need to realize the importance of this.   In addition to the Urban Fighters mode, Gekido offers a special Arena Battle mode. This gameplay mode allows players to fight in a free-for-all battle of up to four players in a single arena. The idea is definitely a good one, but ultimately doesn't live up to what it could be because of unbalanced characters. With the set of characters that are available at the onset of the game, there definitely appears to be a major advantage to using Ushi as his size and power seem to give him a distinct edge in the four player skirmishes. Players can get around this by choosing more balanced characters, but that shouldn't be something that the players should be worrying about.   Graphics Graphically, Gekido is a fairly solid game. The 3D polygonal models of the characters and enemies aren't quite as detailed as what you'll find in a one-on-one fighting game like Tekken 3 or Tobal 2, but aren't too shabby when you factor in all the characters that can be on screen at once. And while there are a few bouts of serious slowdown, the game moves at a fairly consistent framerate even with over a half dozen different characters on the screen at a given time.   The game's 3D backgrounds are also quite detailed, feature quality textures, and are littered with various objects that are fully interactive. Depending on the player being controlled, many of the objects, such as big cars and huge crates, can be picked up or moved around by the player. The most impressive component of the game's graphics is undoubtedly the various lighting effects that are sported throughout the game's levels. The dynamic shadows, the flashes of lightning, the pouring rain, and all of the other different lighting effects are quite impressive to say the least.   On the negative side, in addition to the occasional bouts of slowdown, there are also various problems with clipping, texture warping, and a variety of other graphical glitches. However, the good definitely outweighs the bad in this case.   Sound While the punch, kick and collision effects in the game are pretty much standard fare and not really notable, the environmental and background effects were quite impressive. All of the different ambient effects, such as the thunder and rain, added a lot to the atmosphere of the game's various levels.   Gekido makes use of several different licensed rock songs, including some very recognizable tunes. In some cases, this works out really well because some of the songs really fit the game's style perfectly. However, a few of the songs just seem completely out of place and while it doesn't destroy the game's atmosphere, it surely doesn't aid it.  Back in the day, I was a huge fan of side-scrolling beat-'em-ups like Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and so on. These types of games were all the rage in the arcades in the early '90s, and on the 8-bit and later, 16-bit consoles. However, much like classic scrolling shooters, the side-scrolling beat-'em-ups have become a dying breed and a rarity in today's gaming market. While there have been a few games released in this genre on the PlayStation, with Fighting Force 1 and 2 being the most well-known, none of them have managed to bring back the fond memories of the legends of the past. At first glance, it would appear to be that there just aren't any good ones being developed these days. However, after playing Gekido, which is one of the better games in the genre, I've come to conclusion that the genre is just extremely limited and hasn't really evolved any in the past 10 or so years. Gekido manages to be a fun and enjoyable game, but only at a purely primal level. The one player game gets extremely repetitive and quite tiresome. And even with the different characters and level branches, there's not really any sort of diversity in the game's flow. It all really boils down to constantly fighting hordes upon hordes of enemy characters. What really saves the game is that it's one of the few new games on the system that supports two-player cooperative gameplay -- as most of today's multiplayer games have friends pitted against each other. Nothing about the cooperative play really stands out, but there's just something rewarding about teaming up with a friend and defeating the bad guys together. It's something that's lost in most of today's games. All in all, despite Gekido's flaws, I actually had some fun with it. If you're looking for something that's going to blow you away or astonish you with its depth or revolutionary play mechanics -- then stay away from this title. However, if you're looking for a quality beat-'em-up that you can play by yourself or with a friend, then you might want to give this one a look.", "date": "Jun 3, 2000"}
