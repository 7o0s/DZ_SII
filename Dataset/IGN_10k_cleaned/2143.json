{"name": "Rampage: World Tour", "name_review": "Rampage: World Tour", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/28/rampage-world-tour", "text": "Rampage was a delightful game when it first debuted in the arcade. You could drop a quarter in and enjoy smashing buildings and eating people for a few minutes at a time. It was great for getting your aggressions out and then moving on. Why would you want to play this game for hours at a time?  Midway has now re-released Rampage as Rampage World Tour, and despite the longer name, the game is pretty much exactly the same. Humans have been turned into giant monsters with nasty tempers, and have decided to make the cities of the world their playthings. You control one of three monsters, doing the smashing thing until each city has been decimated. And, although the look of the game is slightly updated with prerendered sprite monsters, the majority of Rampage World Tour looks just as you remember it: flat, two-dimensional, and sprite-based.  Herein lies the problem with Rampage World Tour. Nothing really new has been done to the game. Control isn't particularly better, nor is it any more fun than it was years ago. Levels seem to repeat endlessly, each one just slightly more difficult than the last. Just because there's more stuff shooting at you, doesn't mean it's more fun. Even the two-player mode seems old and tired.  Unless you absolutely loved the original game, you may find the new version a bit one dimensional. I know I did. And I loved the original.
