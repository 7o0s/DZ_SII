From notes scrolling down to five frets at the bottom of the screen to unleashing banked rock power, this is following the Guitar Hero formula to the letter. Gameloft even went out and licensed some of the same songs that have appeared in previous Guitar Hero games, like Nirvana's ~Heart-Shaped Box.~   The big question is, of course, whether the Guitar Hero experience can be properly translated to mobile. The answer is a surprising ~sorta.~ Whereas Guitar Hero is essentially digital fantasy fulfillment, Guitar Legend hits the right notes, but comes off more like a cover band. There's just something about holding that plastic guitar -- and that something is missing here.   If you're familiar with Guitar Hero, then you'd instinctively pick up on the basics of Guitar Legend. There are five frets at the bottom of the screen. On the easier settings, you just stick to the middle three notes, mapped to 4, 5, and 6. On harder difficulties, the outer frets are used and they are assigned to 1 and 3. In expert mode, when you must use all five frets, this becomes a mind-scrambler. You want to reach over and hit the imaginary number key to the right of 6 for that fifth fret, not reach up. It's not easy to master, but if you stick to it and practice in the free play mode, you can get good enough to at least pass the songs. Just don't expect any five-star ratings.   Hitting a string of notes fills your power meter. When the meter, shaped like a lightning bolt is full, press 0 to unleash the equivalent of star power and multiply the point values of hitting notes.   Guitar Legend includes a story mode that follows the career of an up-and-coming axe grinder. The more faces you melt at shows, the more songs, arenas, and extras you unlock. This is where you spend most of your time with the game, acing through songs and riffing through jam sessions.   Obviously, the limitations of mobile effect more than the controls -- the licensed tracks in Guitar Legend are, as expected, nowhere close to MP3 quality. However, the eight licensed tracks still sound remarkable for wireless. Each song was instantly recognizable, from the growling melody of ~Smoke on the Water~ to the main line of ~Message in a Bottle.~ The way the songs drop in and out depending on your performance is also quite good. When you blow a note, the song temporarily falls away until you get back in the groove.   It all comes together, but there's just no escaping the fact that Guitar Legend is an imitator. Instead of trying to fashion a mobile-specific guitar game, Ganeloft squeezed the experience into a handset and accepted the shortcomings (such as the controls) as is.Until Hands On Mobile releases the real-deal Guitar Hero Mobile, Gameloft's Guitar Legend is as close as you can get right now. I played the game while waiting in line for a panel at the Penny Arcade Expo last weekend and several people wound up looking over my shoulder, genuinely impressed. (Of course, they all thought it was actually Guitar Hero.) Getting those outer frets right takes some real practice, but you can get the hang of it in free play. If you area total Guitar Hero freak and can't stand the moments you're away from your Xbox 360 or PlayStation 2, Guitar Legend will get you through the day.", "date": "Aug 28, 2007"}
