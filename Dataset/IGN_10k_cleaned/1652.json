Its style and visuals should come as no surprise as they follow in the footsteps of the blockbuster hit, Rogue Squadron. Named after the Episode I prequel, Battle for Naboo sets out not to bring the movie to life, but rather the world and style it was set in. As Lt. Sykes and Captain Kael you'll fight your way over vast plains and dogfight through endless skies. Quite simply, there isn't another title on the N64 like it, bar Rogue Squadron. The only real disappointment is that it takes place under the wings of Episode I and not the priceless renowned trilogy.

It was only a matter of time until developers Factor 5 and LucasArts followed it up with another fast-action shooter. Battle for Naboo proves to be a worthy follow up to Rogue by improving on nearly everything that held it back from perfection.   You get a chance to fight with and lead the rebels through the Episode I world via the hands of movie side-characters Captain Kael and Lt. Sykes. This makes for a very bold attempt to create a storyline, because you won't be controlling the most popular characters that graced the silver screen. Instead the plot parallels the action found in the movie and occasionally tosses you into the middle of some of its biggest moments. This is good for the reason that it lets you play a supporting role on the shell of the Episode I storyline, but on the other hand you can't help but feel disconnected from the world-altering Star Wars license. After all, The Phantom Menace was hard enough for Star Wars fans to adjust to. Being part of the outside of that story will be hit and miss with followers of the series.  But, enough about that; while the storyline plays an integral role, it's the gameplay that will overshadow it all. And overshadow is just what it does. When you think of Star Wars you think of lots of glowing lasers and plenty of turrets and enemies to go with them. This is one area that isn't denied glory. You'll be humming along in your N1 Starfighter and one of your co-pilots will scream out for backup. Then 10 enemy fighters will fly by like a flock of birds and you'll instantly be thrown into the chase. This is what Battle for Naboo is all about. Each level (and there are 15 of them, not counting the hidden ones) offers several of these scripted battles and objective briefings that always come via a cut-scene.   But all the action doesn't take place in the air. This prequel-based game provides an unlikely offering of vehicles -- both ground and air. In just the first two levels you'll saddle up in three different types of craft. It's this kind of diversity that gives Battle for Naboo its kick. Without it, the constant seek and destroy gameplay could have become redundant.   With that in mind, though, it would have been great if some of the objectives revolved around more than just destroying the enemy's firepower. A few cut-scenes come to mind. One shows your team firing at a bridge to knock it down, and another shows your teammate shooting down some boulders to block the enemy's path. These more ~passive~ actions can add a lot of depth to gameplay and it would have been nice to see some of this. That's not to say that it's completely absent. Some levels allow you to destroy antennas to knock down shield power, and at other points you may have to destroy a specific part of a stronghold. Regardless, though, most of the gameplay revolves around protecting your crew and fending off the enemy. It's not a bad thing at all, in fact it's often quite enjoyable, but some of those more ~adventurous~ objectives could help mix things up.  How might one sum up the entire experience? To put it simply, Battle for Naboo is a well-crafted sci-fi adventure with intense and ferocious gameplay. The control is tight and intuitive (especially familiar to Rogue Squadron experts) so it pulls you into the dogfights without any overhead. Nearly every level features a different atmosphere -- all very realistic -- which are complimented by their immense proportions. And, it features the technical brilliance to back it all up. Really, we only have a few reservations about the gameplay. The first and most notable drawback is the lack of interest in the characters and world around you. Not many really like the Episode I theme when it comes to Star Wars. Most self-respecting fans have to admit it will always be more enjoyable to take the X-Wing up against Tie Fighters. Another drawback is the radar system. It's not the most intuitive radar ever created and occasionally it will send you reeling in circles. But it's real inadequacies come into play on the outer space levels. Because there is no way to tell what altitude plane your enemies or target lies upon, many players could end up cruising around blindly for a while. Some up or down arrows would have greatly helped. In general, though, these are minor issues. Ones that may go easily overlooked for some.   Graphics There's one mission in this game that will make you weak in the knees every time you see it. It's called Liberation of Camp 4 (one of the last few missions) and features a beautiful sky set above mossy mountains. It's a perfect example of the lush and gorgeous visuals found in Battle for Naboo. Each level has its own way of setting the mood with an attention-getting set of color themes and textures. Most importantly, however, the creators really nailed the immensity of it all. When you fly through a gorge or valley you really feel surrounded by the endless, towering landscape. It actually makes you feel tiny in comparison, which is exactly what players need to become immersed in the world instead of just the levels.  What makes this gigantic lushness possible is the vastly improved draw distance over Rogue Squadron. Whereas in Rogue it felt like you were flying just behind a wall of fog, Battle for Naboo draws all the way to the horizon. And even though it can't draw every hill and mountain all the time it manages to almost fool your eye. When it needs to, the mountains slowly fill in far off in the distance, thus avoiding any sudden changes. Most times, though, you really don't even notice it. The only apparent draw-in or pop-up comes in the form of trees or other objects like houses.  It does all this with a pretty solid framerate that only seems to waver during some of the cut-scenes. It's simply mind-blowing to think of how many polygons on the screen at once without causing a hitch in the framerate. Three, six, or even twelve fighters might fly by your team (also composed of five or six people) and the framerate doesn't budge. This is definitely pushing the N64 hardware like few others do. But, that's not all. These colossal landscapes are well complimented by the slick animation from all the crafts. The ships don't move on boring straight or even relatively predictable tracks. As you chase after the enemy they'll tilt, dodge, and swerve their way to avoid your lasers. It all looks very smooth and very realistic. There's nothing synthetic or choppy about it.   Case closed, Battle for Naboo is one of the prettiest games to grace the N64. The intimidating landscapes, colorful textures, and silky animation all come together to create visual treat. That's not even counting the menu screens, which run at a perfect 60 frames per second, featuring smooth Flash-like animation.   Sound Those audiophiles over at Factor 5 had their hand in this, should there be much reason for doubt? Definitely not. Like Rogue Squadron before it Battle for Naboo is chock full of crystal clear surround sound. Ships will quietly hum in the distance or blaze over your cockpit. It's all extremely atmospheric and noticeable. You won't have any regrets here, and there's just as much voice acting to compliment it. Not only is each mission briefed in full voice, but all throughout the missions your team will constantly talk to you and keep you briefed on the current situation.  Along with this, of course, is an orchestrated soundtrack that will fade in and out depending on the level of action. It's all perfectly composed in the same vein as John Williams himself. You wouldn't believe it, but Factor 5 seems to have squeezed a full orchestra inside your N64 cartridge. The violins, flutes, and the thumping of bass drums are only inevitable. It's very rich, and you absolutely cannot and will not be disappointed with the spanning soundtrack and accurate sound effects. Battle for Naboo doesn't waste its time holding your hand in the first few levels. You're thrown into fierce fight sequences and ordered to complete objectives without question. This is all for the better, because the control and gameplay is so intuitive that you wouldn't want to spend your time crusing around a training room learning how to steer. Surprisingly, though, I find the later levels to be the most enjoyable. Much of the beginning revolves around land-based battles and even city battles. Shotting droids is fine and dandy, but when it comes down to it taking on a flock of Tie Fighters...err, I mean droid ships is what it's all about. Who can remember the names anyhow, I mean this is Episode I, it's not remotely as memorable as the original Trilogy, which is one of the major drawbacks of this license. Regardless, taking on a flock of the enemy ships can be pretty intense. There's just so many of them and you feel empowered by the experience. This is what I feel the game is all about: feeling empowered by something as little as an intimidating flyby. In the end, I only have a few complaints with Battle for Naboo. You can only be ordered to blow up the enemy or protect your crew so many times. I hope in the future that titles like this receive a little more attention to the objective list. Surely rebels have something better to do like steer their way through an asteroid field or forest. Even an objective such as picking up an item and transporting it might provide a little diversity in the gameplay. Aside from all that, though, I'm entirely satisfied with Battle for Naboo and highly recommend to anyone who's into this type of game. If you're a skill freak you'll spend a lot of time perfecting your accuracy in this. Any fan of Rogue Squadron should enjoy Battle for Naboo just as much if they can get past the Episode I barrier. Oh, and one last thing. Remember that this follows the same path that Rogue Squadron did. To say that there aren't many secrets would be downright slanderous. It features some of the coolest secret levels and bonuses any N64 cartridge has ever seen.", "date": "Dec 16, 2000"}
