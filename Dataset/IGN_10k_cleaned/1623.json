But while the hard-core Sega die-hards may take the vision of a rushed PSX hand-me-down as crap on their well-manicured lawn, there may be some good in these lazy games. For one, mass-marketed Dreamcast games help define the system as ~mass-market,~ something the Saturn never felt. This baby's got legs, and it's running like the wind. But that's all market talk and industry speculation -- the main reason it's not so bad to have PlayStation games on the Dreamcast is that PlayStation games sometimes aren't too bad. Sure, 102 Dalmatians is slobbery and unpolished and mangy. Were you expecting pedigree gaming from 102 Dalmatians? Of course not. All I'd ask for is a mildly amusing adventure with the color and spirit of the films that controls like a perky puppy and won't pee on my couch.  Instead of being yet another Mario clone, 102 Dalmatians is one of the first Spyro clones. Same difference, but with that game's pleasantly agreeable difficulty structure and bubbly graphics tucked into the concept of 102, this game is perfectly suited for the youngsters would want this one. And in much the same way that the baby dragon had a whole world to enjoy and run wild with, 102 Dalmatians ambles along for fun, breezing through nicely designed (if not entirely polished) mini-games and added adventures.  Taking on the roles of either Domino or Oddball (whatever suits your fancy -- they're the same breed of pooch and control the same as well), you're on a mission to rescue all of your family from Cruella DeVil. It's an urgent mission, but with the bumbling cretins assisting Cruella, there will still always be plenty of time to do whatever a dog might enjoy doing along the way, including sniffing out bones and sliding down hills.  There's a host of meanie baddies trying to catch the pups, but they're really there just to play -- for the most part, the game's difficulty is down awfully low to get the kids playing all the way to the end. Robots, toy cars, and cymbal wind-up monkeys all line up to get knocked down by a mighty bark. Sure, a touch more challenge might have made the game more an accomplishment than it is, but Prolific Publishing and Crystal Dynamics realized a very basic principle of children's games -- kids like to make stuff blow up or fall down, and they like to think that they did it all by themselves. Thus, enemies fire rockets and run around in the background while you're at a distance, but when the pups get up close, they're not so much a threat. Even the dog catcher Horace, who shouts all kinds of cocky cockney curses at the dogs, has a tough time netting Domino when the dog's standing on his shoelaces. For better or worse in terms of gameplay, it's like playing a videogame with your dad on a rainy day. Kind of nice.   There are whole blocks and corners of London to explore in 102 Dalmatians, and that's most of the gameplay. Domino (or Oddball) run amuck in the park, in a factory, in a museum, and anywhere else a dog might play. In keeping with the theme of making kids happy whether or not the gameplay is outstandingly improved by it, there's a lot of seek out and find in this game. Kids love pick-ups, and even though snagging all of the bones in the game is a chore and a half, it's something that most youngsters wouldn't bat an eye at for the chance to collect sticker puzzles (fairly useless, but to a five-year-old...) and unlock mini-games (much more enjoyable).   In terms of control, 102 Dalmatians plays much like Spyro -- kind of bulky and flat-footed, but still fast and fun. The dogs can't do stunts or make jumps that Mario might, but they're sharp on their toes. It's an easily enjoyable platformer with very few drops to fall off of (all of which just drop the pup back onto some form of solid ground instead of a bottomless pit), so the frustration level is very, very low. Some of the puzzles are cheap and simplistic, but it's still enough to spark a kid's imagination. Our only want is that Crystal Dynamics gave the game a better camera -- it's shifty in the main game, and in the would-be excellent mini-golf game, it's completely useless in figuring out where the hole is.  Need we say that this is a bright and cheery game any longer? I'm assuming you already know what to expect with the graphics as well -- not a lot of polish, but lots of flourish. The colors and emphasized building designs are vivid and sparkly. It's disappointing that the designers didn't even afford to sync the lips in the conversation scenes, but it's a quality-over-perfectionist quality argument here, as there are dozens upon dozens of talking scenes in the game with superb voice-over talents, including a famous one -- Malcolm In The Middle's Frankie Muniz. Yes, it's barely a polygon or resolution pixel better than the PlayStation game, but the smooth motion and animated characters wouldn't have gotten much better after tweaking on the Dreamcast -- it would have been a kid's game no matter how they shined its coat.   102 Dalmatians  is fluff, and perhaps one of its greatest qualities is that it's not a necessary play -- no Sega fan can get away with skipping Sonic Shuffle even though it's a clunker, but nobody will ever ask on a message board if you've conquered 102 yet. It's for your brother, your sister, your mom, your girlfriend... It's a game that strives not for a great experience or incredible emotions or revolutionary control -- all this pup wants to do is make somebody smile. Maybe even giggle. --Marc Nix", "date": "Dec 12, 2000"}
