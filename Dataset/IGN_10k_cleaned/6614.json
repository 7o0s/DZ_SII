Square Enix's Grandia III isn't quite the massive, epic RPG that most of us thought it was going to be. Despite the various reports out of Japan that it was short on length, skimpy on the sidequests, and strange in the plot department, I was hopeful that Game Arts would give us the Dragon Quest treatment and add (or extend) a couple of things for the American market. Long story short, it didn't change a thing.   But what does that mean for the U.S. player? Well to start, it means that they'll get their hands on one of the single best RPG combat systems around. In fact, some could even argue that Grandia's fundamentals are THE best in the genre (and I wouldn't be inclined to disagree). Bold statement aside, what is it exactly that makes the so-called ~Ultimate Action Battle~ mechanic so fantastic? It's a number of things really... but at its heart, it's the system's ability to give users fast-paced, action-oriented combat while still providing them with the options and tactical tools to adjust their strategies.    How does it work? Well, if you've played 2002's Grandia Xtreme then you already know. Almost identical to that system, Grandia III's combat revolves around two different circular interfaces that give you all the flexibility you need. The first tool, known as the IP gauge, uses facial icons for every onscreen character (both allied and enemy) and those are then used to illustrate which combatants have the initiative. Once a character's portrait moves into the ~attack~ portion of the gauge (colored red), they can issue a command in a semi turn-based fashion and carry it out once they've approached their target. But here's where the strategy comes in -- if a character is hit with a strong enough attack from an enemy before executing their own strike, it will cancel them out of whatever action they had planned (and their placement on the gauge is reset). Figuring out who to assault and who to defend against is very important with this kind of system.   The combat itself is setup in a similar fashion, with a ~Command Wheel~ that has all the traditional RPG icons like 'item' and 'defend.' Players can also choose to initiate 'combo' or 'critical' attacks using this wheel, and when used in conjunction with allies, can put together some truly crazy enemy-killing maneuvers. Add unique skill types, character-specific special moves, several weapon styles, magic, and the all-new ability to perform aerial combos (and juggles) to this already deep equation, and you can see very quickly how robust Grandia is. As an added bonus, random battles are gone too. Players can directly engage or surprise their opponents just as they could in 2005's Radiata Stories.    Another one of Grandia III's great strengths is that it looks exceptional. Boasting unique character designs and nicely-directed cutscenes, the game has a lot of visual personality. The environmental detail is just as impressive, and while the characters themselves aren't as well-crafted, their animations are. It's just too bad that Game Arts opted not to include a widescreen or progressive scan option -- it would have been fabulous to see the game's terrific backgrounds in a much bigger light.    Because the battle system is so strong and the game is so attractive, Grandia III does a great job of reeling you in early. The action is also helped by an entertaining intro sequence that shows you how the main character Yuki decides to be the pilot... but not in the most obvious of ways (and that's what makes it cool). Rather than just show you a quick flashback or an epiphany that sums up his feelings, the director uses a creative vignette of clips taken from a movie about another pilot that Yuki idolizes. It's actually a lot more interesting than it sounds in this description, and sets the stage for the adventure rather nicely.   The initial few moments of the story are just as intriguing. Whether it's Yuki's first flight in his trusty ~Airplane #19,~ the chase sequence that brings him face to face with the Communicator Alfina, or his meeting with the sly Captain Alonso, the game's introduction of various plot threads is done very well. By the time your group hits the high seas and does battle with a batch of killer birds six hours in, you'll really care about what happens to these people... but sadly, not for long.    You see, one of Grandia III's biggest problems is that it starts a number of different plot devices and doesn't completely resolve them. You'll meet characters that you think are important (with potentially deep and interesting histories) only to move past them with little or no development. To make things even more frustrating, the more interesting party members you'll acquire are quickly taken away from you -- replaced by vastly less-engaging folks that come a dime a dozen in other RPGs.   I had a bit of a weird realization when playing through Grandia III actually, as it seemed to be the mirror opposite of another role-player released this week, Tales of Legendia. In that game, it started off slow and ended strong, while Grandia starts off strong and ends like a snail. In Legendia the story was cheap but the characters were well done... while most of Grandia's characters are hard to latch on to, but the force that brings them together wasn't too bad all. Weird.    The bigger issue that Grandia faces, though, is that it's as linear as they come. Other than a couple of tiny mini-games and immediately accessible smaller quests, the storyline only goes in only one direction. Once you've beaten the game (which is around 25-30 hours) or are looking to extend the amount of time you invest, you'll find that there's really nothing else to do. This would have been a lot more acceptable if the story didn't have as many holes as it does, but like I said earlier, it suffers from some serious resolution issues -- which makes having less to do that much more bothersome.    Another irksome problem with Grandia III is that even if you don't mind a lack of sidequests, there aren't a lot of places to go during the main storyline. Between the towns and dungeons there are barely more than a dozen places to visit, and in this day and age of massive RPG worlds, that's a hard pill to swallow. The good news is that the areas you do visit are a lot of fun to explore, and that's because of the excellent combat system mentioned earlier. No two areas are exactly alike, so at least there's variety.   To be fair, I should also give proper respect to Grandia III's boss battles. They're extremely well done and are nowhere near the cakewalk of the second game. Infrequent as those sequences may be, I really looked forward to each and every one of them because of how well they push the limits and powers of my characters. Being able to sit around and participate in the interactive ~meal conversations~ with party members is a nice returning feature as well, and the translation and vocal dialogue are all of high quality.    Grandia III is an interesting beast. Despite its relatively short playing time and lack of things to do outside the main quest, its battle system, initial character introductions, and boss fights are compelling enough to warrant a total playthough. But I suppose that's a testament to how fantastic the warfare in Grandia III really is, and it gives me hope that one day the same battle system that can make an average RPG a good one will benefit from a truly epic storyline and the other necessary elements to create the instant classic it could potentially be.", "date": "Feb 11, 2006"}
