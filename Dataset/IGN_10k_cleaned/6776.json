But in the case of voodoo priest Akuji, few days could be worse. His would-be bride has been stolen away, his own brother has killed him, and, to add insult to injury, has ripped out his  heart and banished him to the excitingly-named ~underworld.~ Not your average wedding reception, but it nonetheless sets the stage for the latest adventure genre offering from Crystal Dynamics, a company better known for the decidedly more light-hearted Gex series.  Relying on an enhanced version of the Gex: Enter the Gecko engine, Akuji the Heartless combines dark, dreary environments and eerie lighting effects to render the frightening underworld and its equally creepy inhabitants. While some aspects of the game's visual presentation (such as Akuji's jumping animation) leave a lot to be desired, it clips along at an impressive rate, boasts some trully stunning special effects, and, all the while, manages to retain a consistently spin-tingling atmosphere. Where most ~scary~ games are hit-and-miss in terms of their shock value, Akuji the Heartless never dips below grotesque and often surpasses the point of disturbing.  Gameplay wise, Akuji the Heartless is a solid effort. Despite the aforementioned visual akwardness of Akuji's jumping, the control is largely spot-on, and there are more than enough new play elements and puzzles introduced from stage to stage to keep the game fresh. It's certainly not just a series of same-looking, same-playing stages strung together. Almost every stage has you fighting a different type of enemy, learning a new skill, or solving a series of moderately difficult puzzles in order to progress.  It's these puzzles and the unmistakable atmosphere that keep the game from becoming ~just another action-adventure offering.~ The gameplay in and of itself is really nothing you haven't experienced before, but the way it's presented, paced, and polished push Akuji the Heartless beyond ~better than average~ territory and into the league of games that are definitely worth playing through. You'll never feel as if your efforts have been wasted, or that you're not getting anything out of the game.  Overall, Akuji is another well-done offering from Crystal Dynamics. It looks good, sounds good, and, most importantly, plays even better. It's not the end-all be-all of action-adventure games, but it's definitely one of the better available on PlayStation.
