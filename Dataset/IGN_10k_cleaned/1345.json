I haven't always enjoyed the direction it's been taken in, but the Close Combat series has struck a nice balance between fact and fun. Last year, the folks at Atomic Games took us to the Black Forest to recreate the Battle of the Bulge. This year, they're taking the game, in a largely unaltered form, to the landings at Utah Beach with Invasion Normandy. Notice how this one isn't called Close Combat V: Invasion Normandy; it's just Close Combat: Invasion Normandy. That little omission says a lot. This isn't that different a game from Battle of the Bulge in terms of technology, but the few shifts in the game's concept are welcome changes to the Close Combat model.  So what is new exactly? Most importantly, CC5 now includes a force pool management system. No longer will you have to make do with the forces given to you by the computer. Now you can change the makeup of each of your three platoons before you enter a battle. For me, this is fantastic; no matter how many times I tried, I still can't find a practical use for those bazookas. To be honest I'd much rather have mortars in their place. With the new force pool management, I can trade out those useless bazookas for something I can actually use.  And this new flexibility allows you to better tailor your force to the mission at hand. On defense you might not need as many recon or assault units. Load up instead with machine-gunners and snipers. This customization makes the games a lot more interesting and adds a new sense of force management to the overall campaign game. But while this is an amazing addition, it does have one small oversight. When you return a unit to the force pool, they loose all their medals and kill rankings. It's not that big of a deal, but it does break the continuity of the game somewhat.  Another refreshing change is this latest version's focus on infantry combat. For many of us this is the heart of the series anyway, and it's great to see CC5 heading back to its roots. While there are some tanks lying hereabouts (mostly on the German side of things), CC5 is all about foot soldiers sloughing it out across the Cotentin Peninsula. This is another improvement as far as I'm concerned. While it's great to orchestrate huge armor battles, there's a nuance and subtlety to the infantry combat in the game that can't be beat. And as the game takes place amid the beach obstacles and cities that were such a feature of the Invasion, tanks are really out of their element.  A few more changes are apparent from the battle screen. First off, there's now a field on the soldier menu bar that lets you see the speed and supply status of the selected unit. This isn't really a completely necessary addition, but it does tend to speed up your awareness of your units. A new weather model changes the weather dynamically during the battles thereby affecting resupply and support strikes. And while the same support options are here as in previous games, the new Naval Bombardment strike is available for the American player in coastal territories.  The new strategic game has some strong and weak points as well. The entire Contentin Peninsula is reproduced here and you'll have to move your battle groups throughout the various regions on your drive to victory. You'll need to be conscious of enemy position, the location of supply centers and the proximity of your own reinforcements. While it's great to play on this larger strategic level, there are a few snags. First off, the interface is a little too confusing. It's hard to tell the difference between your units and the enemy's, the camera is zoomed in too far and the various icons that represent support strikes and combat status are indistinct.  But the 44 individual battle maps are quite nice. I think it's about time we take it for granted that you're going to have a hard time seeing your units against the map. C'est la guerre. But the maps recreate the beachheads and cities associated with Utah Beach. There are lots of fortifications and hedgehogs on the beaches and lots of gardens and bombed out buildings in the cities. And once you start fighting, the buildings are going to disintegrate even further. I dig the locations in Invasion Normandy. They offer a lot more of the city fighting that was (understandably) missing from the previous game.  On the subject of fighting, it doesn't really seem that any changes have been made to the AI since the last version of the game. It's still relatively inactive and shows a serious lack of initiative. It seems far to easy to take objectives that lie midway between you and your enemy's starting position. They just don't move fast enough to secure important objectives. And as far as tactical sophistication goes, the AI rarely resorts to the flanking maneuvers that your human opponents will use against you. Still, the game AI does offer a reasonable challenge to most players.  The real challenge lies in multiplayer, but unfortunately, the game relies on the matchmaking services of the Zone and Mplayer. I hate to punch a lifeless pony but the interface for these services is pretty poor in my opinion. I'd much rather have an independent matching service within the game. But since I don't make the game, I only complain about 'em, I guess I can't complain. Wait...something I said just didn't make sense. Oh well, multiplayer is supplemented with a nice scenario and campaign editor. I wish that there were as much flexibility in the single mission editor as there is in the campaign editor but both are serviceable enough to extend the shelf life of this game substantially.  So there's a lot to recommend in this game and only a few minor shortcomings. The few limitations imposed on you by the game design are forgivable and the shift in focus to infantry based combat is welcome. Like many wargamers I had first dismissed Invasion Normandy as a low-budget 'sequel' to Battle of the Bulge. After spending some time with the final version, I can see that the few changes to this version are more than enough to make it stand out as its own game. It still looks a lot like the previous game, but it requires an entirely different approach.  -- Stephen Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
