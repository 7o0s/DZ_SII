The ideas behind the sequel, Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, including more spy gadgetry, more intelligent enemy AI and the unprecedented online multiplayer mode, were more than enough to get us salivating all over again. Now that it's here and ready to be enjoyed by all, we're convinced more than ever that this franchise is here to stay and this game in particular is a major contributor to the evolution of the stealth-action genre that used to be dominated by Konami's Metal Gear Solid series. This time, the solo campaign isn't the main attraction. In fact that component of the game is slightly improved over the original. It's the all-new online multiplayer mode that steals the show for Pandora Tomorrow and makes this a must own videogame experience.  Gameplay  The solo campaign in Pandora Tomorrow is improved over the original with new challenges that take advantage of Sam Fisher's new abilities and gear. It feels like a natural extension of the experience we had in the first game and this is both good and bad. Overall, the main story mode feels like it could've been done in the original game if only the development team had had more time to tweak and tune and fiddle with the final version. So improvements like the three-alert system where enemies will don more gear to protect themselves and become more aggressive as you cause more need for alarm is a great concept until you realize that you're getting audio cues from Lambert or the guards themselves that ~they're going on high alert~ or ~returning back to normal.~ It's an attempt to keep more casual gamers engaged in a franchise that some perceived to be too difficult the last time out. However, for fans of the original Splinter Cell, and there apparently were millions of them, you may feel like you're taking a half-step backwards.

Sure you may already know how to use the laser microphone and diversion cameras, but using all of Sam Fisher's gear and your wits will be the key in Pandora Tomorrow. Using a special vision mode to first identify a target and then using all you've got to neutralize and or interrogate them is more along thelines of what a real covert operative would have to do. You'd think Third Echelon would have better intel going into a mission, but you're actually gathering a lot of clues about the diabolical terrorist plot yourself as you play through the game.     One of Sam's most dramatic new abilities is his ~SWAT~ move that allows him to quickly pivot through open doorways or alleys in one fluid motion so that anybody in that room won't even notice him. It's another one of those things that should've been in the first game, but we're glad to have it now. Having this option means you can simply bypass hotspots with four or five enemies crowded together rather than take them all on. The health system allows you to partially or fully heal Sam Fisher when you encounter a med-station somewhere in the level. The option for full or partial recovery comes because med-stations can run out of healing juice and Sam himself has a full tie-off-and syringe animation that leaves him vulnerable to enemies that come wandering by.      The enemy AI is much improved and as we said above, the increasing aggressiveness system adds a lot even if it is presented in a way that's too obvious for our tastes. You'll still freak out when you hear the audio cue that an enemy is suspicious about something you've done, but knowing that he's putting on a bulletproof vest and a helmet before he comes looking for you makes things really difficult. This more or less de-emphasizes the importance of gunplay since a bulletproofed enemy is easier to neutralize with a sleeper hold or toxic gas than a bullet from your SC20K rifle. Often times simply remaining patient and waiting around a corner while you observe an enemy's patrol pattern will be the right move in Pandora Tomorrow. The developers have done a god job of getting us to tone down are aggressive tendencies that might have allowed us to blast our ways through the solo campaign in the original Splinter Cell. If you want to go Rambo, then you need to be playing the online multiplayer mode.  Speaking of which  Multiplayer  The solo game is well done and equal to the original Splinter Cell, but the Xbox Live multiplayer experience is where the magic happens. The two-on-two system works better than we initially thought it might and really, Pandora Tomorrow introduces us to a whole new experience in videogames with this mode. With one team of spies that controls and plays like Sam Fisher in the main game and a team of mercenaries that looks and controls like a game of Rainbow Six 3, you're getting two distinct game types thrown together. Human players are competing with one another using two different interfaces and sets of skills and equipment and each side has its own built-in advantages and disadvantages.   There's no doubt that playing the spy side and creeping around will come easiest to most gamers since they will have done so before, but the spies in multiplayer mode are a little faster and a little craftier than Sam Fisher, even if they're not as heavily armed. The brilliant concept of having the multiplayer mode mimicking the solo game is apparent since you have no choice but to be stealthy and non-aggressive as a spy in multiplayer mode. Spies can only kill by sneaking up on enemies and choking them to death since all of their other equipment is intended to deceive and keep them out of sight. Our favorite feature on the spy side is the quick launch system that allows players to pull either the left or right trigger to instantly engage whatever item or gadget you have mapped to those controls. You can quickly drop a choking smoke grenade at your feet rather than loading it up into your rifle and launching it into a room. Smoke at your feet can cover your escape in a tight situation. Smoke into a room can take out a couple of enemies remotely. The choice is yours and that's one of the beauties of the multiplayer mode. There are truly an endless number of ways to solve problems no matter which side you're playing.     The maps in multiplayer are unique and well designed for the games you'll be playing. Sneaking around suspended ceilings and through air ducts is just where you'd expect to find spies. The various gametypes (Sabotage, Neutralization, Extraction) require spies to go to specific points and do something, which is the built-in disadvantage for the spies; the enemies will always know where you're eventually going even if they don't know where you are.   Mercenaries come heavily armed and with special equipment designed to detect spies sneaking around. Plus the disadvantage of playing from the first person perspective is made up by the fact that the maps themselves are full of motion detection devices, cameras and laser tripwire alarms. The motion-sensor and eletro-magnetic vision modes the mercs have will allow them to see anything that moves (even in the dark) or anything that uses electricity (like night vision/thermal goggles). Throw in the helmet mounted torchlight that eliminates any and all shadows and the mercs seem well-prepared to hunt down spies. And they are. Even with the merc special equipment like proximity mines and laser tripwire alarms, the multiplayer game boils down to a game of cat-and-mouse. Tom and Jerry showed us how much fun this can be and the principle holds up in this multiplayer mode.   Typical sequences in a multiplayer match (which can be customized in various ways) will have the spies trying to get in and locate the objectives as quickly as possible in the hopes they can get there and pick up a quick score and mercs doing the same so they can surround the objective with  mines and other traps. Once one detects the other, both mercs and spies have to decide to either hunt-and-destroy or carry on with the greater mission at hand. Obviously, spies are built and equipped to carry on the mission and keep hitting those objectives as stealthily as possible. Mercs are suited to hunt and destroy more than anything. The fun in the multiplayer game comes out when you master the nuances of each side and make your spies lethal and your mercs passively dangerous. In a nutshell, the multiplayer element of Pandora Tomorrow is an all new experience in videogames that you'll love if you have any affection at all for the original Splinter Cell and/or Rainbow Six 3. It takes the best of both games, adds some cool new gadgets and jams them together.     Graphics  Splinter Cell was already a pretty game, but somehow it's become even better looking. The role of textures and lighting was important before, but now the game looks damn-near like a motion picture. There are still far too many issues of clipping and ~skating~ animations for our tastes, but overall Pandora Tomorrow is a stunner.   Sam Fisher himself is looking better than ever. The level of detail in all of his new outfits is actually improved over what we saw last time around, when we could merely see every zipper and strap holding his gear place. Now you can damn near see every tooth of every zipper and the independent animations of his gear pouches jostling about when he runs really help immerse you in his world.  The environments of the game are amazing. From the jungles of Indonesia to the back alleys of Jerusalem, every locale of the game looks unique but stunning enough to be a believable part of the Splinter Cell universe. Speeding trains seem to be the favorite trick for the developers of Pandora Tomorrow because they're an integral part of Sam's experiences in France. The blinding headlights and blur effects work well the the amazing audio, to thrill the hell out of you the first time you experience it. Creeping around the streets of Jerusalem late at night you get to experience old world architecture with wide open walkways but those pesky modern street lamps are always there to keep you searching for usable shadows. The environmental effects like rain, smoke and steam are excellent. The rain comes down so hard on one level in particular that you'll be wondering how Sam can sneak around with soggy shoes. The rippling animations when Sam wades through creeks, bushes or both at the same time should be the stuff of Xbox legend. The ~Xbox grass~ we've been waiting for since Tony Hawk 2x has finally been fully realized.  Sam's new animations like his ~SWAT~ turn or unique ani-transitions during his climbs or nifty escape moves are all welcome additions. While there's more reason to use the split jump in Pandora Tomorrow (it helps you reach  higher ledges), it seems the new half-usable move this time around is the inverted shooting mode where Sam can hang upside down from a pipe or line and draw his gun. It definitely looks cool but there's usually another way to apply yourself to the situation.   The special vision modes are all unique and offer appropriate disadvantages to keep things balanced. We're thinking of the electro-magnetic vision and motion-sensor vision in particular. They're both very helpful in the multiplayer mode if you think there's a spy in the room with your mercenary, but if there isn't the blue (electro-mag) and red (motion) tints that wash over the screen really disrupt your vision.   Sound  Once again, Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow is setting the standard form sound in videogames. You simply cannot and better not play this game with the sound turned down.  You'll be missing to much of the overall experience if you do. The original game blew us away with the way in which sound elements were applied. In Pandora, the application is just as brilliant but you're playing the first Xbox game capable of pumping out 7.1 channels of audio thanks to Dolby's new Pro Logic IIx process. The Xbox surely does 5.1 out of the box, but the two additional matrixed channels SCPT gives you makes a difference if you've got the home theatre set-up for it.   The dialogue is marvelous and the addition of Dennis Haysbert voicing the Lambert character only makes the banter between he and Michael Ironside's Sam Fisher more enjoyable. They exchange information and witty barbs both before and during missions so the two characters become a major reason to keep the volume turned up and your attention on the audio elements of the game.   There are better indicators of how sound is affecting your stealthometer in the solo game. You' don't need to see your meter jumping to know Sam is stomping around or landing too hard from high jumps and making all kinds of racket. You'll just hear it. The ability to use your Xbox Live Communicator headset to whisper lullabies to enemies in multiplayer mode is absolutely brilliant. It's one of those ideas we would've asked for if it hadn't been included. Same with the spy bullet, that allows you to hear your human adversaries chatting with each other whilst playing online. It's technology that we first saw in Ubisoft's Rainbow Six 3 but the spatial sound system is well presented in SCPT too.  Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow is a must have for Xbox fans mainly because of the multiplayer mode. It's a new way to get even more out of your Xbox Live service and shouldn't be missed becuase of this. Fans of the original and those without Xbox live will definitely appreciate Pandora Tomorrow as well, although I have to admit I wasn't blown away by the solo campaign like I was the first time. The revolution in stealth-action can only happen once, so if you're looking for it here, then be sure to check out the multiplayer mode.", "date": "Mar 25, 2004"}
