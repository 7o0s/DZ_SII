Well, not a lot actually, as I spent the whole damn weekend playing it! Before I even begin, I'd like to state that Formula 1 World Grand Prix has to be one of the best F1 games I've ever played. No folks, it doesn't do anything revolutionary, and it has its faults, but to be honest, everything has been produced so well that it's extremely hard to knock Video Systems' terrific work. F1WGP features the official license of the 1998 season, which Ubisoft's Monaco Grand Prix unfortunately lacked. It certainly isn't a vital requirement to success, but no developer in their right mind would turn their nose up to it. Schumacher, Irvine, Hakkinen and the rest of the gang are all here, offering you the chance to take any F1 car of your choice for a spin. To compliment that, all the courses are present, with the exception of Malaysia, which was only just introduced for the 1999 season. Anyway, focussing on 98 (and what a great year that was, right?), Video Systems has implemented a system that allows you to recreate everything that happened during that season. For example, if it started raining halfway through a certain race, that's exactly what will happen here, forcing you to change to wet weather tires. The same applies for the drivers, so expect to see Mika and Michael up at the top, with poor ol' Damon Hill crashing out after a couple of laps.  There are four main modes in Formula 1 World Grand Prix. Single Race lets you race around in any car on any track for a quick spin, Championship allows you to take part in the 1998 season, Time Trial pits you against the clock and Match Race offers some multiplayer fun. As soon as you load the game up, you'll immediately notice how well everything has been presented, as it's extremely easy to navigate throughout the various option menus.  As we told you in our recent preview, F1 World Grand Prix offers fully modelled cars  and tracks, artificial intelligence that recreates each racer's driving style, advanced  telemetry readouts to assist qualifying and race performance (flag waving, chants and jeers), full 3D cockpit with 2 virtual views, a rendered introduction, winning/loosing sequences and  pit stops.   Being particularly fond of the Australian circuit (no, not because it's the easiest one!) and Eddie Irvine (okay, okay . . . it's because he's Irish), they were naturally my first two choices in the Single Race mode. With this being a Dreamcast game, the first thing I was looking out for was the game's graphics. Having watched a video of it before, I was none too surprised to see how well they had turned out for after months of hard work. Visually, this has to be the best Formula 1 game ever, which comes as no surprise, considering it's the latest on the most powerful console in the world.  Monaco Grand Prix was very good, but when you compare it to Video Systems' title, there really is no competition. Comparing both, it's obvious that the former concentrates  on bright and friendly graphics, while the latter focuses on pure detail. Everything has been painstakingly recreated to perfection. In fact, after watching the replays, it's difficult  at first to distinguish that this is actually a game! Yep, it really is that good.  Picking the Championship mode next, I once again stuck with Irvine and began what I knew was going to be a very long challenge! This is hardly a fault mind you, but if you're serious about winning the championship, be prepared to sacrifice your social life for a while. Anyway, this is where things start to get tricky, as you'll have to know a fair bit about Formula 1 in order to configure your car properly for each race.  Technical racing heads can rejoice knowing that they can change almost everything about their car. Steering sensitivity, fuel quantity, tire type, front and rear wing angles, gear ratios and suspension settings can all be configured to suit the skill of the player and the chosen circuit. Then again, if you're lazy like yours truly, you can leave all the work to the computer pit crew!   As in real life, you can opt to go for the Friday and Saturn practice and qualification  sessions, or just jump straight to the grid on Sunday for anything from three to 72 laps!  Should you go for the longer distance, you'll have to make pit stops, keep an eye on your opponents, and have some sort of strategy worked out if you're going for a win. Unlike in real life, you can't rely on your partner if you're up at the top of the table on the final race, as he'll do little to help, making it an even greater challenge. Fortunately, if you're not an expert, you can receive help in the form of automatic acceleration and braking, with both  proving to be extremely useful.   The aforementioned Match Race comes in handy when you're in the mood for racing against a friend. Everything is a rather standard affair, with catch-up options and the like, making for quite a competitive race, presuming both players are of similar skill.  With no other cars for you to contend with, a single mistake usually means that you forfeit the race, which is rather disappointing, but can be excused given the nature of the title.   Up until now, you could be forgiven for thinking that F1WGP is more or less perfect. However, that's not the case. As previously mentioned, Video Systems' title is a visual treat, but suffers from the occasional bit of slowdown when a large stand looms into view from around a corner, or when the full weather effects have been switched on. It can be frustrating, but we assure you, there's none of the pop-up that plagued Sega Rally 2. The lack of 1999 driver data can also be annoying at times, and there's no option to put the drivers who moved at the end of last season into the correct teams. Finally, this is a pretty heavy sim, and can take a while to get into. The lack of an arcade mode doesn't help the situation, so don't even try to pull a powerslide around those corners, as it's just not going to happen!   Ultimately, Formula 1 World Grand Prix is an excellent game, which falls just short to a few minor problems. As I told you at the start of this review, it's not a revolutionary title, but will definitely satisfy your F1 needs as Video Systems has provided an entertaining and quite frankly fun experience. And that my friends, is what games should be all about.  -- Matthew Langan, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
