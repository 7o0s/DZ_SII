Many have tried to create a simulation of the sport - they have all failed, and for the same reasons.  Two-wheeled racing simulations, to be blunt, don't work.  The control interface of a four-wheeled vehicle, an automobile, is pretty easy to replicate with a videogame controller, especially with the advent of analog control.  You talk to your car with a wheel, two or three pedals, and a gearshift.  An analog stick, a few triggers or analog buttons, and a pair of digital buttons for the shifters can do almost the same duty.  A bike, however, is much more complicated.  It's got the same throttle, brakes, shifter, and steering system, but they're not all you control it with.  You control a bike with your entire body, especially in a racing situation, and no videogame interface has ever been able to replicate that faithfully.  That's why EA's designers have moved in the right direction with their second Supercross game, which is as much of an arcade game as the last Supercross was a simulation.  They've taken Excitebike and Ridge Racer as their models here, and the result is a game that's fun to play, even if it kicks realism directly out the window.  Now that the game's design is more or less sorted, it's time for the programming end of things to deal with the technical problems that still hold it back.  Maybe we'll se Supercross at its best on a next-generation console.  Gameplay  But about the good bits first.  Supercross (just Supercross, not Supercross 2001, as if EA wanted to blot out any memory of last year's Supercross) has received a thorough arcade makeover.  While before, making your way around the track was a careful, painstaking process, requiring plenty of attention to following your line, hitting the jumps properly, controlling your attitude in the air with centripetal acceleration, and learning how to use the dual brake system, here's what you need to win in the new Supercross: speed boosts and sliding turns.    Respectively, the L1 and R1 buttons.  The L1 button is a bit like the Z-trigger double-tap from Excitebike 64.  Hold it down and a little gauge in the corner of the screen fills rapidly, scrolling around and around as you hold down the button.  Let go and the ~power clutch~ (whatever that is) takes effect, kicking up your speed.  The trick is to let off the button right when the gauge is completely full, thus giving you the biggest possible boost.  At first, it may seem like a visual distraction, but the trick is to trigger the boost by feel, not sight, since you need to use it almost continuously throughout the race.  It can lead to trouble if you go to fast into turns (while you can turn awfully sharply in this game, you'll still go into the wall if you don't keep your eyes open), but it's absolutely necessary down the straights - otherwise, you'll be handily passed as you case every single double.  Speaking of sharp turning, the R1 button, which in conjunction with your regular D-pad or analog steering activates a quick sliding turn.  It feels a bit like the powerslides in Ridge Racer, like there's a handy little ~drift~ lever mounted next to the brakes.  Your polygonal rider sticks out his near foot and whoosh, you're going around 90 degrees in less time than it takes to blink.  It's not a realistic behavior, but neither are the turns in Ridge Racer, and nobody complains about those.  The bike physics in Supercross are an odd blend of behaviors, actually.  Gravity has a realistic effect, but you can do some downright silly stuff in the turns - it's possible to pull a 180 and more if you push too hard on the powerslides.  It can be annoying to find that you're suddenly going backwards, but once you learn what sort of touch to use in corners, the bikes do behave rationally.  The rhythm of the game, then, goes so: boost, jump, boost, jump, slide, boost some more, et cetera.  You still have to race smoothly, since all the speed in the world won't help if you're whim-whamming off the walls (Supercross has the handy impenetrable-force-field track edges common to all motocross games), but learning the special maneuvers is perhaps three-quarters of victory in the early difficulty levels.  ~Beginner,~ once you figure out how to slide through the turns, is a bit too easy - I won fourteen races of a sixteen-race series by ridiculous margins.  ~Rookie~ is a little more even, requiring you to consciously avoid crashing into walls very often, and ~Pro~ gets a little bit silly.  The differentiation between difficulty levels is simply the speed of your opponents, and they are ridiculously fast on the highest level.  ~Rookie~ feels like a reasonably balanced challenge, though.  The AI-driven riders, as always, are there as place-markers rather than actual opponents - for all of the commentators' talk about bumping bars, they don't oppose you very actively.  When they do, the collision behavior is more than a little unpredictable, choosing to bail you, slow you down, or not hinder you at all seemingly at random.  At the higher levels of difficulty, though, you should have enough to do just sticking to your own line to worry about everyone else's.  Supercross, then, has a pretty solid racing component to focus itself on.  The series features 16 different tracks, and while most of them are relatively similar supercross arenas, there are some looser outdoor tracks to provide a little variety.  The freestyle mode, though, or perhaps I should follow EA's lead and call it the ~extreme jumping component,~ is as much of a wash as that sort of thing always is.  I defy anyone to claim that they can actually have fun with one of these - it's like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater shot full of Haldol, with hideous musical accompaniment in the background (four tracks total, they all suck).  The trick animations are creative, but wooden, and the controls are sufficiently unresponsive that you'll spend a good deal of your time nosing into the dirt while you wonder why that superman-seat-grab Indian air didn't come off like it did the last time.  The one saving grace of the freestyle mode is that the framerate actually hits sixty sometimes, but that's hardly enough to validate a fundamentally broken concept.  Graphics  Speaking of framerate, if I ever see a motocross game that runs at a decent one, I'm liable to fall down dead from shock.  Supercross varies from a reasonably playable clip when you're all alone on the track to complete failure when the screen is crowded.  If you're in a pack with, say, six riders, between the framerate and the whacked collision dynamics you can kiss any kind of rational race behavior goodbye.  This problem mainly arises just after the beginning of the race, though.  Once you're about halfway into the first lap, the pack will stretch out a little and the framerate speeds up enough that you can get a decent handle on things.  It's easier to appreciate the rider animation there, which has some worthwhile high points.  The riders respond well to differences in elevation and orientation (with corresponding friendly camera adjustments), and if you land hard from a jump or case one of the hills, they'll be thrown around in a couple of different routines.  The special R1 turn maneuvers have some nice visual cues as well - turn on the ground and your rider will drag a foot, turn in the air and they'll pinch the seat to swivel the bike to one side.  The animation in Supercross was always good, though - what's improved the most since last year is the texture art.  The riders don't wear so many bright primary colors this time.  Instead of there being the red guy, the green guy, and the blue guy, riders and bikes alike look a little more like the logo-plastered collages you see in real life.  The polygon models have received a little work as well.  Although the jumps are still a little bit angular, the dirt textures are a bit more lifelike, and the riders have some more volume to accompany their smooth movement.  Sound  Art Eckman and David Bailey are the stars once more, a reasonably entertaining and varied commentary team.  They repeat themselves an awful lot, but they have a larger vocabulary than you might think after only a couple of races.  Play through a whole season and every so often they'll pop off something that you'll hardly ever hear again.  The soundtrack, however, is almost entirely a letdown.  The freestyle mode, as I said, includes perhaps four licensed tracks, and they range from tolerable to wretched.  Confrontation Camp's ~Against the Elements~ had me nearly weeping at the depths to which Chuck D has fallen, and Kittie's ~Brackish~ just made me want to knock my head against a window and retch.  The only props for the background music go to DJ JustOne, who put together some great beats for the menu interface.  It's a cool guitar-driven mix with samples from Eckman and Bailey - I wish he'd written some faster background music for the races as well. I like this game in large part because it's driven by smart design decisions.  It's all well and good to boast of realistic simulation physics and tons of customization options (speaking of which, Supercross has none of the latter), but that's dust in the wind if the riding isn't any fun.  The simpler arcade controls of the new Supercross result in a game that's easier to pick up and play, while the selection of tracks in the series mode (with stuff to unlock as well) provides longevity to make up for the shorter learning curve.For next year's outing, though, whichever console it winds up on, the graphical issues definitely need sorting.  A better framerate is first on the list, and the textures could always use some more variety and smoothness.  Also, if you're going to make an arcade-style game, why not sack the freestyle mode and have the level designers spend some time blending a little bit of stunt action with some original tracks - still fundamentally racecourses, but with the potential for big silly jumps, powerslides, and other over-the-top elements.  If you're going to make an arcade game, why not go whole hog?For now, though, Supercross is in much better shape to pull ahead of the miserable Jeremy McGrath and start competing with THQ's Ricky Carmichael (989's Supercross Circuit having bit the big one, it seems).  We'll see how the latest Carmichael outing stacks up in comparison soon.", "date": "Dec 5, 2000"}
