{"name": "Pro Pinball", "name_review": "Pro-Pinball", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/02/06/pro-pinball", "text": "Before video games, before Pong or Space Wars, before computers even, there was pinball. Relying more on gravity than technology, the original pinball tables were nothing more than glorified pachinko games lying on their backs. With the addition of flippers, pinball quickly became one of the nation's favorite pastimes. And even though pinball was banned in some states like New York (because of its players' habits of betting on high scores), the popularity of pinball has endured.  It's a very peculiar experience playing pinball on the PlayStation. Here's a machine, designed to create amazing 3D polygons among other things, and it's being used to emulate metal and wood. Once you've gotten past this little mental block, however, you'll find that Pro-Pinball is, in fact, a great pinball sim.   It's got everything a modern pinball table has, including three flippers, bumpers, elevated rails, magnets, ramps, sink holes, and ball locks, which means multi-ball (you can have up to six balls going at any given time!). They've even included a dot-matrix display with little video movies and challenges. It really does look just like a real pinball machine.   It also plays just like a real pinball machine. The physics are simply amazing, from shooting the ball around the top of the machine, to the magnet tentatively grabbing the ball, to the action on the flippers. And speaking of, the flipper buttons have been set up so the corresponding buttons are on opposite sides of the controller, like a real table. You can even change the camera angle if you like, but we prefer the standard view.  Pro-Pinball's only drawback is there's only one table, but The Web, while maybe not as flashy as, say, Pinbot, is a solid table in its own right. Bottom line: if you're a pinball fan, check Pro-Pinball out. It's realistic, good looking, and down right fun.", "date": "Feb 6, 1997"}
