Though the series started off quite well, things went a bit downhill from there with the next few episodes. We enjoyed spending time with our favorite freelance police, of course, but the frequency of recycled gags, the lack of variety in terms of characters and locations and some thoroughly non-puzzling puzzles meant the appeal was starting to wear thin. Happily, things picked up about midway through the series with much more wacky humor and more inventive (if still not exactly challenging) puzzles.  Today Gametap is releasing the sixth and final chapter in this first season, The Bright Side of the Moon. We're glad to see that this last installment of the season is even more zany than all the others combined and has actually met (and in some cases exceeded) the standard for absurdity set by the original Sam and Max Hit the Road. In this final episode, the deranged duo of Sam and Max must visit the moon to discover what this mysterious Roy G. Biv is up to. (Anyone who didn't know right away who this Biv character was should be ashamed of themselves, but watching Sam and Max slowly figure it out is quite funny.)   On the moon, the pair will have to deal with a slightly run down gift shop owner and a no-nonsense security guard posted outside the hilariously named Blister of Tranquility that Biv uses as his headquarters. All three of these individuals will be familiar to people who have played the previous episodes. In fact, once you gain entry to the Blister, you'll discover plenty of other characters from the series, from Philo Pennyworth to the COPS. (What? No Soda Poppers?) Biv's got a pretty ingenious evil plan that you'll have to stop. Once you screw that up -- and you will -- you'll have to find a way to undo the damage that he's caused to the earth.  The humor here is better than ever. Given Reality 2.0's hilarious writing, that's saying a lot. Sam and Max begin their adventure by unlocking the secrets of a small unicorn statue whose horn works like a mood ring. From there you'll have to gain entry to Biv's hideout and bypass a number of humorous obstacles there. Towards the end of the episode, we're treated to an inspired bit of lunacy as Max's vices are stripped from his body (literally) and take on an animated life of their own. It allows for some truly funny moments -- try talking to the one representing Gluttony for instance -- and in all but one case, some satisfying multi-part puzzle solving. The best part about the whole sequence however is watching the character of the now viceless Max and seeing Sam's distress over it all.  As before, some of the throwaway gags are the most entertaining. The Nixon/Agnew bumper sticker on the lunar lander and Celine Dion being on the Canadian trillion-dollar bill are particularly noteworthy but are still only the tip of the iceberg with regard to humor. Other highlights include watching Sam and Max share a laugh as they recall an enemy interrogator they encountered while crawling around France and, our own personal favorite, the head of the Abraham Lincoln statue's claims that even a disembodied head can please a lady if he's read Cosmo. Forget the puzzles, forget the story; these moments alone are worth the price of admission. There are dozens more that are worth mentioning, but we don't to spoil any more than we already have.   The good news is that the story and the puzzles are pretty good as well. Some of the puzzles, while not exactly challenging, are downright clever and are nicely tied together to the solution of other puzzles. One of our main criticisms of the previous episodes is that the puzzles had a very A to B sort of solution and then didn't matter to the rest of the story. That's not the case here. The first item you pick up in your office is a coat hangar. Though it's only used to solve one simple puzzle, opening up that puzzle gives you the chance to gain access to an item that you can use to help another character attain one of their goals. Once they get what they want, they'll give you a crucial tool you'll need to obtain yet another item that you'll have to have in order to finish the game.      It all sounds a bit vague, of course, but we're trying not to give anything away, but just to point out that many of the puzzles and items are much more related to each other in terms of function and story. Since the puzzles are still fairly linear, you won't find yourself searching for bits you don't yet need, but it's still satisfying to have the different challenges actually build on each other in a more natural way. What's even cooler is that many of the puzzle elements and items have that touch of insanity about them. Solving the vomit puzzles is particularly fun. We just wish there were some opportunities to use it on people that weren't part of the actual puzzle.  Sybil and Bosco are back with an unlikely new profession and a eerie new disguise. Sybil's recently applied to become the Queen of Canada which opens up a number of jokes aboot the ~surprisingly pleasant~ country. Bosco is now pretending to be his own sassy momma and turns in the best performance since his proper British gentleman act in Episode 2. While the dialogue and the delivery are totally cliched and predictable, it's impossible not to laugh at Momma Bosco as she lays out her own brand of wisdom.   Unfortunately, some of the running gags that the series has established don't seem to fit too well into this final chapter. Fans who are waiting to see the Soda Poppers or hear the latest musical number will just have to be a little patient.  Even though our appreciation of those items is somewhat delayed, the audio work in Bright Side of the Moon is quite good. Biv, Bosco and Abe Lincoln's Head turn in great performances here, delivering their lines with the perfect blend of humor and sincerity. The score, though not as obvious as in other installments, definitely maintains the quality we've come to expect from the series. The actors playing Sam and Max have really latched on to their roles and made them their own.  The visual standard's been maintained as well. Though the moon exterior isn't exactly a thrilling location, it's visually appealing enough to the few moments you spend there. Biv's Blister of Tranquility is the real star setting of the episode with loads of colorful slides and statues and spiraling kaleidoscopes and tunnels. His main room is a bit of a letdown unfortunately. Interestingly, since the moon features so prominently in the episode, the street outside Sam and Max's office is rendered in twilight colors, which is a nice change of pace. Since most of the characters and locations have been seen before, there aren't too many other surprises here visual speaking.   Bright Side of the Moon is definitely one of the better episodes in the series and a fitting capstone to this first Sam and Max season. It's not quite as funny or incisively satiric as Reality 2.0 but it does have its inspired moments. It's great to see Lincoln's head again and it's nice to wrap up the whole season's adventures in a neat little package. Admittedly, it's not a staggering climax, but the build up all through the year has been pretty light as well. Still, if you played the other episodes and enjoyed them, there's no reason to pass this one up. It's easily one of the funnier episodes and definitely one of the most satisfying in terms of the overall challenge.We've been holding off on doing a review of the entire season until the final episode was out. Since we have individual reviews of each installment, it seems redundant to package them together into a single review. Still, for those who just have to have a sense of whether or not we think it's worth getting, the answer is definitely yes. While the score below reflects the quality of this final installment, it's a fairly good indicator of the quality of the season as a whole. The first half definitely takes a while to get going and recycles too much content but, once our pair heads off to Washington in Episode 4, things get a lot better.", "date": "Apr 26, 2007"}
