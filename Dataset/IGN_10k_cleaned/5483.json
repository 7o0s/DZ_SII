While that last Tenchu title didn't exactly revolutionize the genre, it did adequately expand the franchise that helped popularize third-person stealth action. That is, Wrath of Heaven may not have represented the pinnacle of PlayStation 2 gaming, but it easily offered fans of the series a significantly improved title to appreciate. Knowing that, it's sad to have to admit that Fatal Shadows not only fails to enhance the genre as a whole, but also fails to offer any serious improvements over its predecessor. Though this latest Tenchu will certainly deliver stalwart Tenchu fans more of what they have come to love and loathe, it will do little else.Despite being transferred over from Activision, Tenchu has been altered remarkably little over these past two years. The basic gameplay formula has remained almost entirely unchanged. In Fatal Shadows players take on the role of one of two female ninjas. Series staple Ayame is the protector of her land and must investigate the slaughter of a rural village, while newcomer Rin is a survivor of that massacre who now seeks revenge. Together, and against one another, they progress through a tale of greed, power, malevolence, and wacky agendas. Even though each of the game's distinctly  clichd archetypes is designed to be exactly what he or she is, Fatal Shadows never manages to tie the story together in an exciting or even believable way. The voice work, as is typical of most ported Japanese titles, screams of a weekend's worth of professional input and rivals Rumble Roses for the most outrageous interpretation of what a tough girl trying to be cuter than an eight-year-old might sound like. In fact, several of the actors seemed to be shared resources. Poor acting with good writing and excellent direction is still tolerable, however. Fatal Shadows, unfortunately, binds its levels together with melodramatic narration that recounts the events of the title with a kind of profound heavy-handedness so stylized it makes little to no sense when taken in context. More troublesome is how each of the game's cutscenes is actually made of about a dozen floating woodcuts and static renders that pop in and out of place. The narrator speaks of battles and vengeance and blood as renders of Rin, Ayame, and some miscellaneous feudal lords merrily cycle on in the background. This makes the already convoluted attempt at storytelling practically senseless.  Squaring Off While the in-game visuals of Wrath of Heaven were never to be knelt before and praised, their flaws become all the more prevalent this time around when much of our generation of gaming has done away with angular environments, poorly articulated models, and muddy textures. In adding larger environs, it seems the team didn't afford itself enough time or resources to increase the level of detail. Notably, characters suffer from puppet-jaw, levels are tired and sharp, and the game offers very little interactivity.Though the raw technical quality of any given object, environment, or character within Fatal Shadows is a bit less than impressive, the animations have been reworked. While they too may pale in comparison to other products (namely Prince of Persia and Jak III), the speed at which the game's protagonists now move is a terrific bonus that helps quicken what were sometimes tedious maneuvers in previous Tenchu titles. Performing actions without being burdened by drawn-out animation routines helps the title retain a slick, quick sort of gameplay that strengthens the fundamentals behind its emphasis on stealth kills.     Actual play does focuses on stealth, but stealth is not required. In fact, the surest way to complete any given level (aside from pass / fail scenarios) is to simply pop the auto-map onto the screen and navigate to where the end objective would likely be (which is super easy to find). To test out how pacifistic a player could be while remaining successful, we set ourselves to completing a level without ever striking an enemy. We managed to beat six missions in this way before we tired of it all. We jumped and ran straight through and over guards and other obstacles. Only the occasional forced fight slowed our pace. We paid no mind to patterns, aggressors, or collectibles. We just ran and won, every single time.That's obviously not the way Fatal Shadows was intended to be played. It's disappointing that skipping all the action and stealth in the game can still result in a quick and easy win, but there are still incentives provided to lure people into putting more effort into actually playing. Ready to knife somebody?Tenchu titles boast stealth kills. Whenever a player manages to sneak up on an enemy, he or she is offered the option to dispatch that foe instantaneously by pressing a button -- precisely depressing the same attack function a second time will even make for a more dramatic kill. Still, each stealth finish isn't as visceral as it could have been, which leaves dismissing enemies in these ways somewhat unfulfilling, especially since the same set of animation routines repeat. What stealth killing does do is award the player with points and scrolls, which are used to purchase new moves and a wealth of extra content. These incentives give Fatal Shadows quite a bit of staying power and a real reason to go about things properly. In addition to quiet backstabbings and absentminded sprints toward goals, Fatal Shadows also offers some rudimentary combat. As has been the case since the series' inception, the melee is hardly an attractive sell. Massive fights are not intended or encouraged. Though it's possible to make use of jump attacks, aerial flips, basic three-hit combos, and precision blocks to dispatch waves of enemies, the somewhat clunky camera and control system prohibits this approach. It's just easier and cleaner to jump away or turn a corner. If you do flee, an AI unit may see your departure, but probably won't pursue and definitely won't pursue aggressively. To illustrate how underdeveloped the AI is, consider this example... At one point our hero Rin stood face-to-face with an alerted enemy guard, who, just behind some bamboo latticework, had noticed her incursion and was quite miffed about it all. He freaked out, sounded his double exclamation mark alarm, and then ran headlong into the fence. And then he didn't stop running. He just stood in place running into the fence like a man on a treadmill. Had he stopped and looked to his left, he would have noticed that he was literally two millimeters from the edge of the latticework. His arm was even protruding past it! All he had to do was shift his body an inch to the left and he could have attacked. Pity softened our hearts and we walked over to him, punched him, and absorbed a few retaliatory strikes to humor the poor sap. Then we walked back to our original position and watched in further amazement as he once again ran dutifully into the fence, face first. This kind of thing happens a lot. Enemies are almost lazy. Ninja Explosion! In one way, laziness lets Tenchu boast stealth action without having to emphasize hardcore trial and error routines. But, when the stealth and the combat don't always work because of camera, control, and rather serious AI issues, there remains little benefit to playing the game in those ways. These problems were present in one form or another throughout Wrath of Heaven, but now seem more imposing given the current state of many other titles. Fatal Shadows simply isn't the successor it could and should have been. And while avid fans will find redeeming qualities and few improvements, Tenchu may yet serve as an accessible first step that leads to more developed titles.", "date": "Feb 11, 2005"}
