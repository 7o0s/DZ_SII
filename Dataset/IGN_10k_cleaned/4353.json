It seems like every time we turn around we're treated to yet another copycat real-time strategy game or a generic shooter. I suppose that it's easier to develop such titles than it is to create an entirely accurate physics and avionics system. It may also be that so-called ~mainstream~ gamers (who make up a larger and larger percentage of the market each year) are, on the whole, less tolerant of the hardcore sim than those of us who are smart enough to build our own computers.  Thankfully, Ubisoft and Eagle Dynamics give the community more credit than some other developers have. The creators of the Flanker series have managed to create a sim that combines the breadth of Jane's USAF with the intense accuracy of Falcon and that's a rare accomplishment in the genre. The game has stepped away from the purely dynamic mission generation that was initially promised, but the alternatives as presented in the final version are still quite compelling.  The conflict at the heart of Lock On takes place above and around the Black Sea. Based on precise satellite data, the maps here are fantastically detailed and offer a reasonable variety of geography. The fictional conflict allows players to take to the skies in eight separate planes. You can fly fast and low in the A-10s and SU-25s, leap off the deck in your SU-33, or try your ass in the office of the sleek F-15 or SU-27. There are also three separate versions of the MiG 29 to play with.  A range of play options are available right at the start, from the instant action missions to the massively comprehensive mission editor. When you get in the air, you'll find that the challenge level is quite high. (You can scale the difficulty by enabling unlimited ammo, fuel and limiting crashes.) Even with the aids on, you'll find that the enemy offers a serious challenge having a good understanding of energy management and radar profiles.  As you might guess by now, this is not an arcade style simulation and you'll need to have a serious understanding of how the systems of each aircraft perform in real life if you're to have any hope of using them correctly in the game. And there's a broad range of systems to understand here -- from the A-10's close-in ground attack weapons to the long-distance dedications of the MiGs. The flight models in Lock On also reveal a tremendous difference in performance based on the plane you choose. The A-10, certainly a plane that sim-heads have a great affection for, feels much more straightforward than the MiGs for instance.   Thankfully there are a number of tutorials you can take on to learn the ins and outs of the aircraft. Each plane has its own tutorial section that covers the specific abilities of that plane. In this sense, Lock On really rewards the time you invest in it more so than a lot of other sims. You'll also need to pay attention to the different cockpit layouts for each of the planes. Those of you who are familiar with Russian acronyms will have an easier time reading the Russian labels on the displays. In keeping with the sterile presentation of the rest of the game shell, there are no voice overs in the cockpit and you'll be forced to read each tutorial tip as it appears on the screen.    And there's a lot to learn here. The radar model alone is quite comprehensive and will take some getting used to on the part of new pilots. (There is a dumbed-down version of the radar that simplifies many of the issues found in the real-world equivalents.) Things like doppler effects and terrain masking are modeled in the game so you'll need to act smartly as well as quickly to take advantage of every feature of this system. The upside to all this realism is that you'll feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment once you figure out what the hell you're doing. But it does take a while even for sim fans to wrap their brain around all the different planes here, particularly when moving from the ground-oriented planes to the air-to-air ones.   There's a fairly cold approach to the between-mission briefings during the campaign. While there's a general shape to the story, there's not much action tying the missions together. I wasn't necessarily expecting a lot of cutscenes or Crimson Skies-style banter but the only thing you can do in between missions is stare at an incredibly complex plan for the coming action.      Once you get the hang of it, the mission editor is quite versatile and allows you to set up almost any encounter exactly the way you want it. One potential problem with the mission designer is that it almost seems too scripted. While this isn't as big a problem when playing other people's missions, the fact that you know exactly when and how things will transpire (discounting your skill, of course) makes it seem a bit flat. Thankfully there are already some missions showing up on the internet so you can jump into some pre-made missions without knowing what's going to happen.  In terms of inputs and instructions, the game needs a serious overhaul. Though we joke about it from time to time, the manuals for these games ought to be 200 pages. The one for Lock On is a scant 48 and nearly a third of that covers the mission editor. You have to dig deep to find the PDF version of the manual on the CD and even then you'll still be disappointed in the layout. There is a lot of important information here but it's too hard to find exactly what you're looking for. Beyond these issues, I'm really at a loss to explain why there was no keyboard overlay in the game. With something like eighty-billion commands to be learned Ubi should at least have included a keyboard shortcut page in the manual.  There are a few features that are included in the manual but didn't seem to find their way into the game at all. Then there are features that seem a bit pointless. Being able to set target markers for other planes is nice but it fails to find any real application within the game, for instance. Hopefully these features will be corrected in the first few patches.  Now, I don't care how powerful you think your computer is; Lock On will bring it to its knees. Even the menu system seems to hang for extended periods of time. I've run the game on a few different systems and it has some problems on all of them. At the low end of the scale, I used a 2.4GHz machine with 256 MB of RAM and a 128MB video card. On that system, the game was pretty much unplayable with the framerate being measured in fractions of a frame per second. There are plenty of options to scale down the graphics, but on that particular test system we still had lots of slowdown. I honestly kept checking to make sure my joystick wasn't constantly sending pause commands to the game.  Moving up to our smoking Alienware machines, we found that performance improved greatly but there were still some framerate issues. The best system we ran it on used a 3GHz processor, 1GB RAM and the latest GeForce card. Even then we had to endure framerates below 20fps. There's plenty of tuning and tweaking to be done here but, even if you invest a lot of time in experimenting with these options, you're still likely to find some slowdown. (This is a perennial problem for the genre -- from Strike Commander to IL-2 Sturmovik.)  But the game does look good. The heat ripple from the exhaust is one of my favorite effects in the game. The shimmer that you get in the chase views is simply breathtaking. Animated control surfaces on the planes help add a real sense of life to the game, while location-specific damage modeling adds a real sense of, well, death to the game. Once you've dished out enough damage to an enemy you'll be rewarded with some truly fantastic explosions.   And the rest of the world looks just as good. The ground terrain is gloriously detailed and really sells a sense of speed when you're cruising by a few feet off the ground. And Lock On doesn't take any shortcuts in terms of details; cities are represented by buildings and forests are made up of individual trees, for instance. In addition to looking great, weather effects like rain have an impact on your flight model. Though it's not as initially impressive, the sound work is pretty good, particularly the afterburners. So Lock On is a fantastic but only partially-finished product. It's our policy at IGN to review the game as you'll find it on store shelves without any post-release patches. That said, we expect that the upcoming patches will transform the game from its current, slightly buggy state into a more solid and enjoyable sim.We're willing to concede the omission of the dynamic battles. We're also willing to concede the lack of an exhaustive printed manual. The game's $40 price tag certainly makes the lack a bit easier to stomach but those big manuals are kind of expected in these types of games.It's not for the casual player who just wants to hop into the seat and start downing bogies; getting to that point will take the casual player a fairly long time, even with all the aids turned on. Lock On provides the more experienced player with some of the most accurate flight and system modeling around and does so with a much larger roster of planes than most sims. The short verdict: if you're in dire need of a sim, this one is hard to beat. Otherwise, I'd wait a few months and see how the title looks once a few patches have been added.", "date": "Dec 20, 2003"}
