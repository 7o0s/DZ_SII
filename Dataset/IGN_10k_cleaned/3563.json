The arcade-driven experience still puts players in the most nerve-racking driver's seat around and brings GCN owners 15 additional Crash junctions. Burnout 2, still reminiscent of the real world of driving, offers up a noticeably tweaked and still insanely high-octane racing environment. The ways it has changed are many, including those good and bad. In a nutshell it can be said that Burnout 2: Point of Impact is simply the best racer on GameCube. Our concerns our few: the lessened difficulty and evident sway towards being even more arcadey than before, for example. The overall package still dazzles us, though.   Now more feature-rich and technically inspiring, this is the racer that GCN owners have been waiting for.    The Facts The drive-dangerously sequel -- race into oncoming traffic and be rewarded Drive wild for burnout boost -- drift, cut-close to traffic, and catch air, an all-new feature Offensive Driving 101 teaches beginners the ropes Brand-new pursuit mode; chase down offender in your cop car and destroy Six new locations, including Miami, Los Angeles, the Rocky Mountains, New Mexico and an airport Bigger single-player mode with far more courses and objectives than last year Tracks are massive, featuring traffic at every turn and diverse territory Advanced artificial intelligence makes Burnout fun to play even alone A totally revamped crash physics engine spits out beautiful particles and insane damage  All-new Crash mode lets you race into cross traffic to compete for highest score Replay mode -- no longer modifiable by player, no save function Tight analog control works brilliantly with the GameCube controller New weather effects include rain, snow, and fog Two-player race mode and up to four-player Crash mode Unlock tons of secret vehicles to unlock including a police car, '50s hotrods and stock cars All-new Custom Series Championship that lets you race modified vehicles complete with body kits and decals More modes than the PS2 version with 15 additional crash junctions Dolby Pro Logic II surround support True 16:9 widescreen mode Progressive scan HDTV support lets you play Burnout in 480p for a sharp, vibrant display  Gameplay If you've never played Burnout before, Point of Impact will hit you like a shot of moonshine and a kick to your groin combined. It's fast. So fast that it's likely your heart rate will actually increase while playing it. The gameplay is wrapped around the idea of purely reckless driving. You get to participate in cross-country races in traffic-jammed cityscapes, curvy mountainsides, and even airport terminals. You race against three opponents that drive just as irresponsibly as you do, and you are rewarded for it. If you want to take first place you are to rocket into oncoming traffic, sideswipe other cars, slide around corners and get airborne. All this plays into the combo system set in place to build up your boost meter, and everything is conveniently explained to newcomers in the Offensive Driving 101 mode. It's mandatory that everyone starts the game via this training mode -- you can't even play multiplayer until you do -- but thankfully if you're already a pro you'll be able to unlock a vehicle by completing it. Plus, it only takes a few minutes.   Back to the boost system. These four variables -- facing oncoming traffic, nearly missing cars, drifing around corners, and catching air (a brand-new feature) -- all help you build your burnout meter. You can mix and pair them to build boost faster. So, if you want to drift around a corner (one) into oncoming traffic (two) and happen to nearly miss hitting another vehicle (three), you will build boost quickly from that combo. Once your boost meter is full, you can tap the R-trigger and you'll get a huge speed boost, which even further multiplies your burnout potential. A ~burnout~ is performed when you use up an entire boost meter without crashing. Aside from the blinding sense of speed, it's the one thing that separates Burnout 2 from other racers out there. This pat on the back for insane driving is what caused us to fall in love with the original.  Burnout 2 is very fast and very pretty.  It's a wonderful game mechanic, but it seems that Criterion still hasn't found its groove for it. Whereas last year's Burnout was incredibly tough -- you could sometimes only earn several burnouts per race -- Burnout 2: Point of Impact seems a bit too easy in this regard. You earn almost too many to count; so many that Criterion has included the dynamic of being able to build burnout upon burnout for high scores. Excellent players will build a half-dozen or more, and this speaks pretty loudly for the new gameplay style. Once you get the hang of it, you will be burning out all the time. In our opinion, this dumbs down the gameplay considerably. It's true that it's more accessible, perhaps an effort to appease the ~average demographic,~ but it hurts the overall experience. Players will quickly become callused to the fact that they are going so fast. It then becomes very easy to disregard the importance of burnouts. Good quarter-popping fun, so to speak? Yes. The perfect medium between insane arcade driving and skilled driving simulation? Unfortunately, it is not.        On the bright side, just because the Burnout franchise isn't yet perfected to our tastes, we are not implying that it isn't an incredible racer. It's the best racing title on GameCube to date, considerably improved experience over last year's version, and one of the better races available for any console. This year comes chock full of new editions that makes us very happy. The single-player Championship mode has been beefed up considerably. It now comes replete with about a dozen original tracks (double that counting the reverse versions), a Chase HQ-inspired police pursuit sequence, face-off challenges with lone racers, and a number of circuits that ramp up in difficulty. The Pursuit mode has you chasing down offender vehicles and ramming them repeatedly until they break down. The circuits within the Championship take place over just a track or two to begin, then three, eventually ramping up to a lengthy six at the end. The courses always differ in one way or another, and thankfully this mode has taken on a new points system -- you earn points based on your placing, so even if you tank a race, you can still recover the loss with a big win in the next round. The entire Championship mode is intertwined; to unlock face-offs, pursuits, and regular races you have to be completing all of the challenges. It's a splendid setup over last year's version and makes single-player truly worth your attention.  The number of unlockable vehicles factors into this, too. Not only can you unlock '50s hot rods, stock cars, a police car and others, but each has different attributes. You would think having the fastest vehicle is the best idea on any track, but that's not entirely true. At times, such as on curvy mountain stages, you'll want to use vehicles with better control. This dynamic, while not fully taken advantage of, gives the larger vehicle selection a bigger purpose, rather than just to wow you with style.   When we take all these separate gameplay parts and put them under the hood of the one functioning vehicle that is Burnout 2: Point of Impact, we do see a much more feature-rich, addictive, polished racer than we saw last year. It has all the trimmings and is very playable for any racing fan. However, there are things that seem to be missing. The AI is seemingly the same, if not as aggressive as before, and there's a lot we feel can still be capitalized on. For example, we got the weather effects we wished for, but they're mostly only for visual flare, and they are not random. Similarly, we now have the coolness of modified vehicles that we can custom decorate with decals, but something like modifiable engines is still out of reach.   In the end, Burnout 2 is a truly awesome arcade racer that is worth owning, especially with the dangerously addictive Crash mode, which lets up to four friends compete in ornate crash sequences.  However, it is also only another step in what we feel is still an evolving franchise. There's more soul to exploit in Burnout yet, so go out there and buy yourself a copy, because we guarantee you'll love it and you'll simultaneously give Criterion a reason to come back with an even greater sequel.   Graphics Burnout 2 is simply the best-looking racer on GameCube, and one of the prettier titles on the console to boot. It takes the slickly tuned RenderWare engine that was used for last year's version and tweaks it in many regards. The dedicated GCN programming team has taken the quality of the graphics to a new level in several ways; better textures, far more impressive lighting, and more geometry compose a noticeably more beautiful racer.   Out of the three aforementioned visual upgrades, the textures and lighting combined are most potent. There's a new ~bloom lighting~ model that Criterion uses produces an additive lighting effect that is often seen in real life. As sun reflections intensify, the pool of reflecting light hits a point where it ~blooms~ outward. It's a eye-catching special effect, and perfectly compliments the specular lighting that has been added to the road tops. Once only a visual feature seen in the Xbox version of the original Burnout, the specularity, although a bit faked, is a nice addition that gives the face of the roads much needed depth.   Car models are much more flashy, and more detailed -- especially the secret ones.  More advanced reflections and car models, fuller with polygons, also add to the visual flare. This was one of the big areas of focus when designing the style for Burnout 2. It takes a nod from the silver screen production The Fast and the Furious and brings more extravagant looking vehicles into the otherwise generic mix; you'll lay eyes on decal-laden, modified hot rods more once you've unlocked the Custom Series Championship.       Continuing with the list of improvements, Criterion addressed the particle effects system. It took the already impressive crash damage system and totally blew it out to be glitzier than anything we've seen in racers before. The crashes in race mode are pretty insane, letting bumpers and hoods fly wild, but it's in the dedicated Crash mode that the particle engine really shines. Every little spark, fleck of paint, and molecule of dust seems to be displayed alongside the explosion of twisted and torn car parts that become projectiles upon impact. It's a beautiful site and is ultimately responsible for making the Crash mode truly worthwhile. Other developers should be taking notes.   The last point of interest in the graphics department is also the most important: the framerate. The holy grail of designing a game engine is attaining a consistent framerate of 60. Last year Criterion did it almost without blinking, and this year the story is the same. Burnout 2 runs at an eye-scorching 60 frames per second in single-player mode and a consistent 30 in two-player split-screen.   The whole visual package is something we're extremely happy with. The custom modified edition of cars and unlockable vehicles including flashy hot rods helps set off the generic look of the unlicensed cars, but we're still hopeful that one day the Burnout franchise will get the licenses it needs to make it truly great.  HDTV fans will also be pleased to know it runs in widescreen and progressive scan modes.  Sound Once again not content with what was done in the original Burnout, the audio team, headed up by Stephen Root, has revamped more than a few elements. For starters, the surround design is supported with Dolby Pro Logic II. Where we cried for more emphasis on the passing traffic that zooms by the player on the left and right, Criterion delivered. Now with Pro Logic II you can hear the surroundscape more fully. Likewise, there are added effects such as the echo of your car as you pass through tunnels -- a feature that was also left out of the original Burnout.   The audio composition, too, has seen improvement. Where the original just didn't seem to gel as much with the style of the game, Burnout 2's soundtrack does a much better job, blending a lot of rock themes with techno influences. There's a problem that presents itself, though. Where the music went quiet in the original Burnout to emphasize the intensity of the burnout boost, it is cued to become louder with a faster tempo in Point of Impact. This perfectly symbolizes the more arcadey, carefree direction that the sequel has taken.   Even so, there's still no denying that the sequel sounds distinctly better. We're satisfied with it.  Burnout 2: Point of Impact has a lot of what I clamored for last year. It has more tracks, more vehicles, a thicker single-player mode, extra modes to die for such as Crash and Pursuit, different weather conditions, pretty visuals, and a more impressive sound package. Plus, the GameCube version is better than the PlayStation 2 version with more crash junctions and an enhanced engine. The reason for the slightly lower score than our sister-site, IGNPS2, is because I didn't feel Burnout 2: Point of Impact was balanced in terms of skill and fun factor. The score should not imply that the GCN version is worse than the PS2 version.I can only highly recommend it to any arcade racing fan. It's definitely worth a buy, even if the single-player content can be experienced in five hours of less. Crash mode, the Custom Series Champsionship, which features more cars to unlock and all the tracks in reverse, and the multiplayer make up for it.However, I'm also hopeful that Criterion does a sequel. I think there's still plenty left to exploit in Burnout. Let's have some licensed vehicles, more involvement with tuning the cars, random weather effects, more interaction with computer AI, and more brilliant mode additions like Crash. Most of all, I'd like to see a happier medium between skilled driving and the high-octane, heart-pounding arcade elements.Few arcade racers can compare to what Criterion has pulled off. I hope there's more to come.", "date": "Apr 3, 2003"}
