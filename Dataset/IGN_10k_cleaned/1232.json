If ever there was a sport that more typified the big, steroid-infused, American mentality, it's monster trucks. Over-sized, noisy vehicles crushing small cars in a display of metallic machismo is about as close to the American way of life you can get without actually buying a CAT hat. That being said, who wouldn't want to drive one of these exhaust-belching behemoths? Thunder Truck Rally, a monster truck racer from Psygnosis and Reflections, has captured the essence of the sport. Like Reflections' Destruction Derby games, Thunder Truck Rally has different racing modes, including a car crushing mode akin to Derby's bowl.  Thunder Truck Rally has a variety    of vehicles to choose from, not just big    trucks, although there are plenty of those. There are souped up VW Bugs and    Vans, jeeps, and even a tank. All of the cars    have been jacked up on oversized    suspensions and look like the kinds of cars    you'd see at a down-home car show. It's    pure middle America.  Racing takes place on open fields and rocky hills, and, unlike ASC's TNN    Motor Sports Hardcore 4X4, you're free to roam off the tracks if you like. The Endurance mode does away with the tracks altogether, with just an arrow to guide you. The jumps and spills are pretty spectacular in the Endurance mode, although it's difficult to gauge when the arrow will change direction (and the computer cars always seem to know before you).  Thunder Truck Rally is a good, solid title, although the grainy graphics do grate sometimes.", "date": "Jun 4, 1997"}
