Emperor: Battle for Dune is the first sequel to Dune II, the great-granddaddy of all real-time strategy games. But although the game reaches back to Westwood's earliest success, Emperor is a new direction for the company. It relies on many of the same conventions we've become familiar with, but it renders them all in gorgeous 3D in a rich science-fiction setting. Better still, the game is in complete accord with the books and the film. Dune nuts'll dig it, and strategy gamers will dig it too. And if you're a Dune nut who likes strategy games...you get the idea.  But let's talk about it as a game. It has a really solid sense of balance. Each of the three Houses has a distinct but not overpowering advantage. My favorite is House Atreides. Emphasizing a balance between finesse and force, I find them to be the most versatile. House Harkonnen is weighted much more towards the force side of the equation while House Ordos relies on a much more delicate approach. There's really something to like in each House (although each House seems to have a handful of units that are truly essential, the rest being a little too specialized to be of much use in a general engagement).  The five subhouses aren't as important to the game as I had originally thought. At least not in the single player campaign. You really feel as if you're making a choice between allying with one subhouse or another but the actual effect of allying with one subhouse seems a little less significant. Sure, it's cool to have Fremen or Sardaukar, but allying with the subhouses basically just gives you access to two new units.  One big change is the automation of the resource side of the game. The game really takes control of the resource harvesting aspects of the game. Just build a refinery and the various harvesters and carryalls will take care of the rest. This frees up a lot of your attention for other tasks, like avoiding sand worm attacks or the storms that tear through your armies. Most of your attention, however, will be on trying to find some level of tactical sophistication in the clash of units that characterizes the game's battles.  I was kind of disappointed in the challenge level of the game. Even on the hardest setting, the campaign AI just doesn't measure up to a significant challenge. This is all the more puzzling given that the AI in skirmish and multiplayer games is a lot more robust. It still suffers somewhat from the lack of organization that plagues the AI in the campaign. This may be more a factor of the open-ended nature of the skirmish games, versus the limitations imposed by the missions themselves. The AI sends out units in a trickle rather than forming them into groups. If your defense is at all concentrated, these small-scale attacks should prove easy to counter.  And although the game boasts a formation feature, it's not that well implemented. Basically you have to create each formation yourself and then issue move orders while holding down the ~J~ key to keep the formation together. While it's a neat feature, it seems like an afterthought. It becomes even more of a problem when you've got units of different speeds and roles. Units also seem to have a hard time getting out of each other's way or, in one memorable skirmish game, around trees.  But despite these tactical shortcomings, Emperor offers an intriguing strategic level to the game. In between most of the missions, you'll need to determine the larger course of the war on a Risk-like map. Each territory is owned by you or one of your two rivals. You can only attack those territories that border your own. Once you've selected a territory to attack, you go to fight itself. If you've already fought there you begin the fight with part of the map already revealed (although you still have to find your opponents) and, if you're really lucky, you even get a base.  While most of the missions seem to have a firm context, there seems to be a few random missions thrown in to the mix. It's all sort of loosely tied together with the fabulous Westwood cutscenes but, since the game is a lot less linear than previous Westwood titles, the sense of progression isn't as strong. Jumping back and forth between real missions and the sprinkling of busy-work missions is a little jarring, but definitely adds to the replay value of the title.   But I still haven't talked about the big thing -- the move to 3D. I normally despise the idea of 3D for 3D's sake and, thankfully, the gang at Westwood have conceived and implemented the 3D engine almost perfectly. The graphics are really sharp (although the dozen or so different types of infantry can be damnably difficlt to distinguish between). The buildings are wonderfully conceived, as are the effects. Cool explosions, awesome gun flash and a really ominous lightning crackle for the sand worms really bring the game to life. As usual, I've got to say that the environments aren't all that varied but that just goes with the territory. How much can you do with sand, right? Still, even though they're mostly brown and tan, the environments are really impressive.  A lot of the success of the visuals are due to the amazing camera. I protested at first that it didn't allow for an extreme enough close-up (adding frustration when you're trying to click on that one engineer who's running up to your construction yard). But even though the camera range and angles aren't as loose as I'd wanted them to be, the camera system is truly remarkable. Switching views on the fly or swiveling around to look behind a hill is as easy as it can be, leaving you plenty of time to focus on kicking your opponent's ass.  Overall, while I think Emperor is a lot of fun, Red Alert 2 offers a lot more fun for a much lower system investment. I should mention that, as beautiful as the game is, it ran pretty poorly on the minimum spec and suffered from some slight stuttering on a P600MHz with 256MB RAM and a GeForce 2. Still, it looked so good on the lowest spec, you'll be tempted to put up with the long load times and slowdown. In any case, the game is sure to please fans of the genre even if it doesn't have the same polish that a title like Red Alert 2 had. Since it's Westwood's first foray into the third dimension, we can excuse the slight lack of refinement.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
