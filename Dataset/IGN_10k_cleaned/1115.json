Those little plastic soldiers have bigger toys that fly this time and the skies just aren't safe anymore for the Tans. Helicopter shooters may not be a full fledged genre of videogames yet, but veteran N64 owners that were disappointed in THQ's Nuclear Strike last year, may actually get some enjoyment out of this bizarre, yet charming Army Men game.   The Features   Four types of helicopters: Chinook, Apache, Huey and Super Stallion. Plastic and ~real~ world environments. Real world settings include backyard, playgrounds, campgrounds and giant sandcastles. 16 one player missions Enemies include toy robots, electric trains, killer bees, dragonflies and lawn sprinklers. Interactive environments will allow players to pick up and use objects like soda cans, doughnuts and chicken legs. Cooperative and competitive multiplayer game modes including Flag-Nab-It, Air Rescue, Food Fight and Bug Hunt.   Gameplay If those green plastic armies ever decide to actually come to our world and wreak havoc, they'll be packing plenty of fire power with their helicopters at least. In Air Combat,  you'll have access to a variety of missiles, guided rockets and other weapons that are actually good for air-surface and air-air attacks. After all, this game is all about mass destruction, so why fool around with some pansy weapons. There are areas and levels where you'll have to use a little more precision and caution, but for the most part it's hit hard, hit often.  Our favorite attack is the kamikaze paratroopers that you can use against powerful ground forces. You launch a landing flare from  your chopper towards your ground target and the guys, yelling ~we're on the waaaaaay!~ come parachuting out of the heavens with M-80s strapped to their bodies. Once they land they run after any evil tan vehicle or structure they see and give their lives to blow 'em up. Now that's loyalty in a toy.   Air Combat employs the use of a winch like Nuclear Strike did, but the Army Men game still puts it to better use. Winching up power-ups, ammo and key objectives all happens at a much more hectic pace in Air Combat. The different helicopters even have different winch ratings that represent how fast and accurately you can drop, hook and reel.   The early stages of the single player game are very basic and end up serving as a tutorial to get players used to the fast paced action, controls and mechanics of using the winch. When it gets tough however, it gets super tough. All of a sudden dodging enemy roman candles is as easy. All of a sudden, dropping off that donut in the enemy base so the ants can come attack everything in their path is a huge risk. The learning curve starts off flat and gets steep quickly. Easy to learn and difficult to master is what we always want in videogames.   The multiplayer games are a blast and even though there are some fundamental issues with the three and four player games, the two player games make up for it. Cooperative play is always nice, and Air Combat lets you and a buddy advance through the single player missions as a team, just like in Perfect Dark.   The variety of multiplayer games, Bug Hunt, Food Fight, Flag Nab It and Rescue each come with a couple of variations and allow you really sharpen your Air Combat skills. We especially liked the one that forces us to bring a variety of food items, like a chicken leg or can of ham, back to our home bases. All of the different items that you can pick up in the game have a different physical effect on your helicopter's handling.  Graphics This is one area where this Army Men game stays close to its roots. Even the stylized look of the ~real world~ can't hide the poor animation and choppiness of the game. The textures on the environments look pretty darn good, but anything else in the game that's actually supposed to move looks strange and moves very awkwardly.  The bugs that can be used to your advantage or your worst enemy, are big juicy, anatomically incorrect mutant bugs. They're supposed to be mutants according to the story, but we have a feeling the insects had their look before they had their explanation. The flying bugs have a minimal amount of wing flapping and so it can be sort of hard to realize they're actually in the air with your helicopter.  It's a good thing the green, tan and blue armies, require all of their soldiers, vehicles and stuctures to be solid colors, because any more detail on any of them would've made this game very difficulty to navigate. The bright primary colors works well with the toy theme, but there still seems to be a lot of detail missing in this game.   Everything mentioned above, only gets worse when you start splitting the screen up in multiplayer games.  Air Combat fixed the problem that Nuclear Strike couldn't, by placing the helicopter in the middle to lower third of your TV screen so that the top area can hold all of the action.   The lone bright spot, literally, in this game's graphics department is in the explosions. They're bright and shiny enough to be an innovation on the N64.  Sound The radio messages, talking mutant bugs and other sound effects are all well done. There so good that we actually have to acknowledge 3DO's effective use of sound in all of their Army Men games. Hearing your heroes and their allies talk it up through out the game always adds to the experience. In many missions you'll get radio messages telling you what you need to do next, so you'll have to have the volume up and pay attention.   There's so much action going on that no particular artillery or explosion sound effect really stands out. This could be a little disappointing but with all that goes on in Air Combat things could get very muddy very easily.   Army Men: Air Combat is an extremely decent game. It more or less succeeds in what it sets out to do, but this game wasn't designed to change the face of videogaming or anything like that. There are a lot of little details thrown in, so I know the development team put plenty of effort into making this game stand out. The single player game may start off a little too slowly for many gamers who want and instant challenge, but the two player co-op mode is really a great time. The N64 is in the middle of quite a drought and that definitely factors into one's opinion of this game. It may not seem like a knockdown good time on the surface but you may get some enjoyment out of it if you give it a chance. A rental is recommended but you may want to save up some cash to buy this cartridge. It may be the only new N64 experience you'll have until the highly anticipated Mario Tennis comes out.", "date": "Jul 20, 2000"}
