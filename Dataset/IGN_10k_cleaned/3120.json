The previous incarnations on the GBA shipped a few months after the hype of the console editions ran down, but for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, the handheld finally gets its version along with the rest of the gaming crowd. For the sequel, Activision again went with developer Vicarious Visions to mimic the gaming experience of the newest version of the extreme sports series...and again, this is a game that can't be missed on the Game Boy Advance. The design isn't revolutionary by any means, and folks who have already played one or both of the previous games on the handheld system will probably take the impressive technical merits for granted. But the evolution of the console series migrates to the version on the GBA, and the additional gameplay elements, moves, and improved level structure opens up the Tony Hawk series further than it's ever gone. Features Six skate parks 14 professionals Create a skater Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge Save Only for Game Boy Advance  Exactly like the previous GBA versions in the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 employs a hybrid 3D/2D engine to mimic the gaming experience of the console versions. The GBA doesn't have nearly the same horsepower of the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube, so the developers have to exploit the hardware strengths in order to pull off the game design in portable form. The result is the Tony Hawk design in a fixed, isometric perspective. The background scrolls to follow the action of the on-screen skater made from a couple hundred texture-mapped polygons, with all of the same thousands of motion-captured skater moves of the console editions. In the Game Boy Advance's year and a half of life, this style of engine has been used in about a dozen games, so the novelty and impact of the GBA pulling off 3D polygons has certainly worn out. But even so, the engine does an admirable job moving a fully 3D game design to the 2D-savvy GBA system. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 more enhances the established design than rewrites the book. Like in the previous versions of the franchise, the challenge is to get through the games different skateparks by collecting items and performing set tasks within the set amount of time. When the quota of tasks and items has been met, you can move onto the next challenging area.  The Game Boy Advance version of Tony Hawk 4 builds as much upon the previous version of the series on the GBA about as much as the console versions do to those editions. Just as the console versions remove the limiting level structure, so does the GBA game...instead of running through the park, trying to complete as many tasks in two minutes, Tony Hawk 4 removes the clock from standard play. Now players can skate around freely as long as they want, exploring every nook and cranny of the parks before they decide to start knocking down the levels' quotas. The challenges are spread out all throughout the parks, and players begin each task by skating up to wandering pedestrians and hitting L...and only that will start the clock ticking. Most of the game's pedestrians have about three or four different tasks for players to complete, so the checklist in each level is pretty extensive.  Tony Hawk 4 also adds a couple of handy moves to the list: Spine Transfers will let players move between vert ramps that are built against each other, and Grind Transfers give players the ability to change up their grind during a grind. Players can also perform a handy bail move if they find themselves flying off a vert ramp at a bad angle, letting them tip themselves so that their sturdy wheels will hit the ground instead of their fragile bodies. This is a move that should have been in the series since the first game...but we're certainly grateful that we can recover off a badly positioned vertical jump.  Most of the quotas in Tony Hawk 4 are the same ideas from previous versions of the Tony Hawk series: grab the letters in the word ~skate,~ perform a specific move on a specific object, pick up random tokens scattered throughout the area, or simply reach a high score within a set amount of time. But there are new ideas, some of which are deviously challenging: players must collect letters in the word ~combo,~ but only by collecting them while pulling off a string of moves. There's also a nifty challenge where players will have to perform specific moves as the names of the moves stack up in the corner of the screen...if they stay on-screen too long, they'll disappear without giving the credit needed to complete the task. After completing enough of the tasks on each park's checklist, they'll be able to ~buy~ access to the next available area in the game.   The Game Boy Advance version of the game also has hidden packages to collect in each level, as well as dollar bills to grab in each area. These packages and money icons will give players the ability to unlock extras in the game, from additional skaters to outfits to boards to a hidden park, even letting players buy specific cheats that will help them accomplish 100% of all tasks list. Everything players have accomplished will be recorded to the cartridge's backup save...it even has a blanked-out list of all the secrets of the game that reveal the items as players uncover them.  This version features renditions of a majority of the console levels: Skate College, Alcatraz, Kona, Shipyard, Zoo, and London. Tony Hawk 4's level design have been cleaned up considerably from the last year's somewhat cluttered layouts, so the odd M.C. Escher effects from the game's isometric perspective is kept to a minimum. But it's not eliminated, as parks will still go behind massive foreground structures. Some levels, namely Alcatraz, have really awkward ~teleport~ areas that will take players to a hidden location by scrolling the map to the extra location.  The Tutorial Mode of the previous games has been replaced with Skate College, and many of the tasks in Skate College are made to teach players the basics of the game. And as clever as this mode is, there are a couple of issues...namely, how some challenges require you to pull off specific moves, without telling players how to pull off these moves. The ~pivot~ during a manual, for example, is a new element to the Tony Hawk design, yet when players are asked to pull off a Manual with a Pivot, they're never told what command actually pulls off this pivot move (answer: the R button). When all is said and done,  Tony Hawk 4 isn't a huge step visually from the last version in the franchise...but the enhancements to the game design make this sequel a much more enjoyable extreme sports title. The additional challenges and the way they're presented really enhance an already excellent game series. The GBA version still has its quirks, and the ~ooh neat~ factor of getting the Tony Hawk experience on a handheld has definitely faded away, but Tony Hawk 4 is thorough design with a lot more challenging tasks than the previous games.", "date": "Oct 29, 2002"}
