First, there are the Pokmon fans who've been with the series since its inception as a Game Boy RPG. Others picked up on the whole hype machine by the animated series that began airing in syndication, and then when Warner Bros. picked up on it a few months later. Then there's the third bunch  the trading card group, the players who collect, trade, steal, and pawn these Wizards of the Coast game cards during recess. These guys are the most vocal, and probably end up in the limelight a lot more often. ~Kid Stabbed for Pokmon Cards~ say the headlines. You'd think that all Pokmon is, is a card game from all the mainstream press the cards get. Damn the rest of the market.Well, for those who haven't gotten into the Pokmon Trading Card Game from Wizards of the Coast now have an opportunity to figure out what all the hubbub's about.  Nintendo has taken more than 200 issued cards and jammed them into a Game Boy Color cartridge, offering a virtual take without the clutter or cost. The Game Boy Color game is a blast to play, and might push a few converts in Wizards of the Coast's direction. FeaturesMore than 200 cards to collect, trade, and useRPG-style adventure and turn-based battleBattery back-upLink cable support for two playersFor Game Boy and Game Boy ColorI really have to give the kids credit  Pokmon Trading Card Game isn't exactly a cinch to play. It's a bit on the complex side on how it works, and that's why the Game Boy Color game forces you through a strict training exercise to explain how the Trading Card Game operates. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it  to start the quest, you'll have to spend a good ten minutes with the professor. Now for those already trained in the art of the trading card game, you might find this little routine a bit dull. But for those of us who haven't spent our allowance on booster packs are going to need the extra push down the right path. The tutorial does a great job explaining the rules, but only until you've actually played a few games afterward will you actually grasp the details. The training exercise is a pre-determined script -- it never changes. What you learn in the training exercise is, obviously, how to win the game. The whole concept is to use your creature and item cards in such a way to eliminate every one of your opponent's creatures in his hand and in play  finish him off by eliminating four creatures or all of his Pokmon in-hand or in-play, whichever is fewer. The only way creatures can attack is if you attach a certain combination of energy cards to that creature  each of the creatures attacks have their own needs, so you'll need to study their capabilities to know what they'll require. Some are standard attacks which whittle the opponent's HPs down, others do the usual Pokmon thing  sleep, paralyze, confuse. Figuring out how an attack will affect your opponent is definitely key to victory. You'll also learn to evolve characters and utilize item cards to strengthen your side of the table, just as long as you have those cards in your deck, of course.Once through the training, you get your starter deck. Like the Pokmon RPG, you have your choice: Charmander & Friends (Fire deck), Squirtle & Friends (Water deck), and Bulbasaur & Friends (Grass deck).  And like in Pokmon, each type of creature has its own strength and weakness against another type of creature. And since you attack each other with creature cards, it's best to know how to start and set up your decks ahead of time.  You can keep a total of four different decks in memory, and it's up to you to make sure you're sorting through your cards, breaking them up to create a killer deck other than the one that's offered to you at the beginning of the game. So now that you've made it this far, the point of the game is to earn eight Master Medals (much like the Pokmon Badges in Pokmon) by playing the Club Masters of the area. But before these masters will play you, you'll have to locate other members of the club and defeat them. Only then will the Club Master come out and play you. The quest isn't much of one, since you really only jump from one club to the next finding other characters to play  it would have been a bit better if the game followed the whole Pokmon style and offered an entire landscape to traverse. It does mirror Pokmon in the sense that you've got a rival who's always a step ahead of you. Rotten jerk...But the quest is only a minor part of Pokmon Trading Card Game. The whole challenge is to create and build killer decks from the cards you find and earn. Cards are handed to you after a victorious battle, or through e-mails from the Professor. These booster packs are essentially your prizes for progressing through the game. It's up to you to figure out how to create a deck from these cards  oh, you can have the AI build you one from scratch, but half the fun is seeing if you can anticipate your opponents' styles with styles of your own.And the quest is only just a mere sliver of what Pokmon Trading Card Game intends in the gameplay department. The further along you get in the quest, the more cards you earn, the more powerful decks you can create. Why? To go up against your friends, of course. Because this is a Pokmon game, it's going to sell regardless what type of game it really is. The more copies out in the market means the more opponents you can challenge. So make sure you have a link-cable with you, since the game has been tailored specifically for one-on-one play. This game arguably focuses more on link-cable support than the original Pokmon does, so make sure you track down a few buddies with the game to really put the game through its uses.Don't go expecting Pikachu to leap out and give you a big ol' hug  the only Pokmon in Trading Card Game are the imaginary type. Well, you know what I mean  they're only imprinted on the cards you play. Animation during battle is limited to attacks and defensive icons that appear on the cards during play. There's a lot of flash during the game, but don't be floored with elaborate motion between the two players. The game also isn't the most vibrant Game Boy Color out on the market, either, but it's colorful when it needs to be. Like when you're awarded a booster pack after a battle, the pack shown has lots of detail.The only real problem with the game is its randomness. No matter how powerful you make a deck, you're still at the mercy of the luck of the draw and the flip of the coin. The game does emphasize brains over brawn, though, and if you can't build a decent deck you're up a creek. It'll take hours or even days for you to figure out what combination of 60 cards you should put together for an unstoppable deck, and the value here is immeasurable. Some games, like Tetris, last a long time because you just can't stop playing the game. Pokmon Trading Card Game is going to get a lot of play because of all the micro-management that needs to be done. And the payoff is very satisfying  I can't tell you the excitement felt every time I won a game and got the opportunity to rip into the booster packs I've earned after a battle.Hey, whether you like or hate those darn Pokmon...if Nintendo keeps making Pokmon videogames of this quality, those creatures aren't going away anytime soon. Keep in mind, Pokmon Trading Card Game isn't a pick-up-and-play game. A lot of thought has to go into how you approach each opponent. But the sense that you're actually accomplishing things in the game is extremely powerful  though the game depends on randomness, it's really your choices and your mentality that's going to make you win the game. Because there's a finite amount of Pokemon cards in Pokemon Trading Card Game, it's definitely not going to be a complete replacement to the Wizards of the Coast game.  The quest is very short and basic, but the whole idea is to build a few decks to play against another person through the link-cable. The replay value is very high because of this, and with all the kids who are going to play this game, it's a good idea to keep a copy of the game with your Game Boy Color collection wherever you go.", "date": "Apr 11, 2000"}
