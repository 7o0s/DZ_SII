To challenge Electronic Arts' dominance in the category is to box a glacier, but Gameloft still aces up with their pigskinner Reggie Bush Pro Football 2008. Without an NFL license, Gameloft introduces a league of fictionalized teams with names like the Buffalo Hotwings, but the cute stops there. The core of the game is sim football, pure eleven-on-eleven mash-ups at the 40-yard-line.   Last year's Reggie was a solid contender against the Madden brand, but this year's edition doesn't fare as well. EA Mobile made a few strides with the newest edition of the game that are sorely missing here. Namely, mapping the passing controls down to the lower end of the number pad feels creaky. Especially when the receiver mapped to the # key manages to cross over to the left side of the screen. That engages a half-second of cognitive dissonance. And in football, a half-second of hesitation is enough to lose the big game. Madden now engages a one-button approach that makes the game more accessible.   The game does offer a few clever tricks that do improve on the 2007 edition of Reggie Bush. Each team now has its own playbook, making each club a little unique. That's a neat feature and something worth exploring to greater depth should the game ever go multiplayer. Against the computer-controlled players, though, this feature's significance is diminished. I also liked the addition of tackle zones that take some of the guesswork out of stopping the ball. Once a runner enters this zone, pressing the OK button engages the tackle. The zone does not guarantee automatic tackles, but it eases up the need for precision movement on a device not exactly known for precision controls.   However, even with these new additions, Reggie 2008 feels like an incremental improvement over last year's game. The playbook presentation is a little more refined. The sprites and animations aren't a big step-up from last year's model, but I still like the stadium entrances before each game. That's always a nice touch. The clarity of information while in play is a bit better, too, but these are to be expected with a sequel.   What it comes down to is whether or not the game is fun, and I honestly preferred EA Mobile's Madden. The one-touch control scheme is smooth and easy to use. And while I am not exactly known to be a Monday morning quarterback, I appreciate the inclusion of the full league license. But what ultimately undid Reggie 2008 for me was the overall pacing of the game on all difficulties.   The speed of the game felt inconsistent on the Sony Ericsson w810i I used for final testing. At times, the players all seemed to enjoy a sudden speed burst and the field got a bit crazy. Suddenly, I felt like I wasn't 100-percent in control of the game. Reggie Bush Pro Football 2008 is a decent football game, but it's not the top draft pick this year by any stretch of the imagination. The new features, such as the unique playbooks, are good additions, but it's hard to work backwards from the control advances of Madden. If for some reason you're absolutely opposed to giving EA money, you can download Reggie for a football fix. This year, though, I'm sticking with Madden.", "date": "Sep 25, 2007"}
