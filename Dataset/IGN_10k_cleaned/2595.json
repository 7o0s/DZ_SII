It means that you have a better chance to get your game idea recognized by consumers and a far better chance of selling it to them. Usually you want to do this with a popular movie license, but for some reason Bam! Entertainment has chosen to publish Driven the videogame, based on the rather appalling movie starring Sylvester Stallone and the exquisite Estella Warren, who was far too clothed to help save the box office flop. So, it's rather curious that Bam! chose to develop a title based on the license. For a movie that prided itself on furious action, the result is an unexciting, tedious racer that you'll probably want to steer clear of.   Features  Immerse yourself in the dangerous, yet seductive world of open wheel racing Based on the film, Driven, starring Sylvester Stallone Featuring the vocal talents of Sylvester Stallone Enter ~the zone~ with special visual and increased handling Take the race into the city, chasing teammates through busy streets, avoiding oncoming traffic and wrecking Choose from Arcade, Story and two-player modes Unlock additional tracks and cars Experience true team racing with two different perspectives -- blocker and racer for pole position Choose from eight teams, 12 drivers, each with distinct personalities and driving styles Eight tracks, from sunny California to the winding, wooded circuit of Germany GameCube version features improved control and handling Upgraded visuals over the PlayStation 2 version   Gameplay The setup for Driven is very straightforward. It features an Arcade mode, an acceptable Story mode, and Multiplayer. Arcade mode lets you jump right into the racing, while Story mode offers up 14 objective-based racing situations that takes you through eight tracks including California's Angel Bay and Paris' Champs-Elysees. The plotline loosely follows the movie, but the developers were granted enough creative freedom to improvise a few new elements. The team even got the voice talents of Sylvester Stallone, Greg Proops, and Eric Myers to help drive things along. The presentation is a bit odd, though. It feels somewhat like a comic-book or Saturday morning cartoon. Instead of using FMV cut-scenes to push the story forward, still art of character faces will crawl up onto the screen in the midst of the dialogue. So you'll hear Stallone's voice and see his still art likeness on the screen as he talks to himself or you will see the announcers conversing with each other via head-to-head still art.   Despite the quirky presentation and straightforward design there's still some decent ideas there. There are 12 different characters that control somewhat differently and have their own personalities. Furthermore there is a gameplay mechanic known as ~The Zone.~ Like in the movie, you can enter ~The Zone~ for increased handling. Unfortunately, it really doesn't do much for you. The core of Driven -- the racing -- is just dull and fairly dreary. The core control mechanics, jerky and frustrating, in combination with the monotonous gameplay just makes for an overall boring experience. You aren't impressed by the sense of speed, nor the crash sequences, and very rarely anything at all.   You'd think racing through the city would be fun...but it isn't.  The ideas are there, but they just didn't come together in the end to gel into a fun game. It should be noted that the controls are definitely improved over the PlayStation 2 problem, which were a huge problem, but Driven will very likely leave you feeling frustrated and bored.   Graphics Driven comes to you via the all-new Blurr-O-VisionTM technology (please note our sarcasm). The developers in what we believe is an effort to mask flickering and aliasing problems have completely overused a motion blur effect. You can barely make out signs in the near distance if you're turning even slightly. There's some decent texture work and some good art design, but it's all a big smudge. Then there is ~The Zone~ effect, where the sides of the screen blur in a mish-mash of pixilated browns and greens, only to impair your vision, totally defeating the purpose of it. It looks bad, despite its intent to be an improvement over the PS2 version, which blurred even more of the screen.   The title does run at a constant 60 frames per second, however, which is a nice improvement over its PS2 twin.    Sound Most of the sound in Driven is very average and unmoving. The music isn't repulsive, but it's certainly not impressive and some of the voice acting, mostly Stallone's, is just terrible. Stallone's presence is further worsened by the lack of his true self in FMV form. Hearing his studio recorded voice along with the still art is just bad. It leaves you focusing on his voice, and you can almost hear one of the producers saying, ~Okay, you're going to start out focused on your object and then get excited. Soget excited. Are you excited, Sly? Let me feel your excitement!~   The rest of the sound effects are run-of-the-mill and definitely don't hear many unique engine sounds and environmental audio, which almost ruins the purpose of licensing Dolby Surround for the game. The cars are pretty much the only objects that are sourced. You pass under tunnels, bridges, and by palm trees and you want to hear your car echo off them as you zoom by. It doesn't happen, and even when a car approaches from the rear the Dolby surround is poorly done. Everything is off-balance and bland in that department.I really, really tried to give Driven a chance. Despite not enjoying the movie at all, I figured that perhaps it could be a decent racing game. It didn't take long at all before I was frustrated with the controls and sickened by the almost frightening overuse of motion-blur. Everything about Driven is just lackluster. I wanted to go racing through the city streets, crash into a tree and see my car split in two, leaving trails of fire behind the flying debris. Most crashes instead are very lame, as you watch your car fly off into the distance via floaty physics or see a wheel pop off with little effects. The one thing Driven has going for it is that it's the first true racing game released for GameCube. It has some simulation elements for driving, but even in that regard it's just lackluster all around. It may be worth a rental if you want to get your racing fix very badly, but schedule a more exciting activity shortly after -- like crocheting or crossword puzzles.", "date": "Apr 4, 2002"}
