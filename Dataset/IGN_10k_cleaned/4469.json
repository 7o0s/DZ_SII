I mean, lets face it; our beloved hobby comes at a premium. The bargain bin will often brim with quality games simply too old for prime real estate on store shelves. WWI: The Great War, however, is not one of these games. It didn't have an illustrious run on the ~new release~ shelf and get demoted over to the bargain bin. No ladies and gentleman, this historical RTS locked on and shot over to the bargain bin from the get-go.   It's a shame, because The Great War focuses on one of the most important events known to man: the First World War. Surprisingly, the RTS genre has all but neglected WWI until now. Game developers have made tons of sci-fi, fantasy and WWII RTS games, but never bothered exploring the first big war of the 20th century. Now that we have one such game, it seems we could have waited a little bit longer.   The Great War starts well enough. You're given the choice of engaging the conflict from either single player or multiplayer mode. Single player splits into three modes of play: Mission, Campaign and Random Maps. Regardless of which option you choose, The Great War lets you battle from the perspective of five different nations: France, Germany, Russia, Britain and Austria-Hungary.   The Mission option gives you the chance to play through six isolated scenarios of WWI Like the ~Lodz Operation~ for instance, which has players leading a massive German offensive on the Russo-German front. Or the ~Prasnyth Operation,~ where you control the Russians in a bid to purge the North-West Front of German occupation. These missions hold hours of entertaining carnage and serve as an appetizer for the bulk of the game, which resides in Campaign Mode.    Thing is, if you didn't like making your way through the handful of scenarios in Mission mode, you might as well turn off your machine and call it a day. The Great War has some bruises that do not get better with time. The first notable issue lies with the game's interface -- it's just way too small and not laid out well. Instead of using a drop down menu, the game crams all options available to a unit into a small box on the lower left hand side of the screen. Seeing as most RTS games only come with a handful of options per unit, this normally wouldn't be a problem.      But The Great War gives you plenty of choices, especially for the worker/peon units, whose chunky list of build options is stuffed into the tiny icon box on the bottom of the screen. The bottom right of the interface holds the game map and remaining options, including your economic and military advisors, and mission objectives.    The top of the interface holds information on the five resources you collect in the game: Gold, Oil, Wood, Food, and Iron. Resource collection plays a crucial strategic role in many RTS games, but here it comes off as an afterthought. Most scenarios start players off near an oil well, a gold mine, a forest, and an iron mine -- all of which are seemingly inexhaustible, making food the only resource you really need to contend with.    The game boasts 60 ~painstakingly researched historical campaigns,~ but most feel like you're playing the same scenario, save with a different nation. Before each campaign, gamers get a brief history lesson through text intros, providing a backdrop to the ensuing battles. Aside from this though, most of the campaigns play out the same way: build base, defend base, amass huge army, send them out to capture and destroy.   The way each scenario plays out feels equally uninspired. The game engine boasts the ability to display up to 80,000 units, but the units suffer from a lack of pizzazz. Each of the five nations has six types of basic units: infantry, calvary, artillery, fleet, aviation and tanks, but nothing really sets them apart. On the plus side, the game shows of some pretty snazzy explosion effects. Unit animations are silky smooth even on an aging machine, but that's not saying very much. It would have been nice, and more accurate, to include the quirks that made each nation's armies unique.    Instead, German bombers act like a British Bombers, and vice versa.  Add to that the limited choices in each unit category, and the game's repetitiveness is liable to wear you down in a hurry. Also, there doesn't seem to be a big difference in units anyway. When you hire an officer, as opposed to a regular infantryman, you expect a hardened badass to stroll out of your barracks. Unfortunately, no such unit exists in this game. Aside from a snazzy suit and added production cost, there isn't much to elevate the officer from his cheaper subordinates. Plus, unit formations in the game have gone MIA, so you don't even get the visual bonus of seeing officers lead an assault as they often get lost in a sea of lesser units.   Well, at least you can send in your disorganized forces into battle with some wicked tunes in the background right? Not quite. To say The Great War has bad music would be like saying WWI was a bad war. WWI was a horrible tragedy, and so is the music in this game. Some of the tracks even resemble carnival music -- hardly the kind of orchestration needed while gunning down forces of oppression. The game does feature decent sound effects, but the mortar fire won't have you diving behind your gaming chair.   Another area where The Great War could have used some serious tweaking is unit AI. Too often I would order my troops to march into enemy territory just to have them scatter like a band of frightened refugees. Units also have a tendency to do whatever it is they feel like doing. For example, I had this one worker unit who loved harvesting so much he would repeatedly run back into the harvesting fields after I had ordered him to build a sawmill. While hard headed A.I. seems funny at first, it grows old after the third time enemy units reduce your base to cinders for not building defensive structures quick enough.     Another instance had my anti-aircraft units trying to down enemy planes on their own accord. Which was fine, yet when I ordered them to open fire, they sat there and watched as the planes bombed them to bits. Wait. It gets even better. A few hundred enemy units had poured into my compound and devastated my base. Only a single building and a few guard towers remained. My twin guard towers then succeeded in gunning down 3/4 of the enemy as they stood around my lone building, refusing to blow it up.   If you manage to blast your way through the missions and campaigns in single player mode, you can take the fight online in multiplayer mode. You can war with up to eight players and choose among eight scenarios, including action in the Eastern European Theater and the Battle of the North Sea. Multiplayer adds a dose of enjoyment, but the small amount of gamers playing over open servers will have you begging your friends to buy their own copies in order to squeeze a few drops of fun out of this mode.Who knows how WWI would have ended if the Earth possessed such dimwitted armies. Or maybe it never would have ended. Lucky for us, it did. And lucky for you, WWI: The Great War is one global conflict you don't need to experience unless you really, really want to.", "date": "Feb 18, 2004"}
