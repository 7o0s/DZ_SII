It sets the violent and bloody mood and begins a cavalcade of strategy and violence that kept me hooked to the computer for hours and would keep me hooked for more hours were it not for the fact that I have billions of other games to play. It isn't that Dawn of War does anything extraordinarily new or brilliant in terms of gameplay mechanics, but the battles are just so damn entertaining and the pace of the game fast enough that it's hard not to have a good time.   The Warhammer 40,000 universe is an incredibly rich one. As they say, in the distant future, there is only war. And the war in the distant future is the unforgiving, brutal, no-nonsense kind of war with uncompromising soldiers leading the charge. All of the races in the galaxy want to slaughter each other... badly. Through thousands of years humans have become one with their violence, adopting a kill or be killed mentality when dealing with these alien races. But along the way, they've also adopted a kind of religion and spirituality that is neither fluffy nor particularly comforting. Their undying Emperor and his theocracy is the centerpiece of a human life washed in blood and order. To protect this mighty Imperium millions of men and women carry weapons as part of the Imperial Guard. On top of that, clans of battle hardened and enhanced soldiers known as Space Marines float through the galaxy bringing war against the enemies of humanity. Each chapter of the Space Marines gives complete allegiance to the Emperor.   The campaign itself centers around one of these Space Marines chapters called the Blood Ravens, designed and included specifically for this game. There are many other races in and about human space, three of which have been included for the purposes of the game. The Orks, Eldar, and forces of Chaos all play a part in the drama that arises during the single player campaign of Dawn of War and stick around for the bloodletting of skirmish and multiplayer. Each of them have their own personality and style of play to keep things fresh. The Orks are built for war, but lack in firm technology using a junkyard wars approach to battle while the Eldar are an ancient and magical race that consider themselves superior to all others. The Chaos mix in all three races with the taint of evil washing over all they touch.     And in this, Relic has done a stunning job. The dark and gritty Warhammer 40,000 universe has finally been given its due. As I said earlier, the scene is set right off from the moment the awesome intro cinematic provided by Blur Studios begins. I can see why they won't let players skip through it the first time the game loads up. I'm not even sure how many times I've watched it at this point, but it certainly makes you long for some sort of animated movie or series in that style.   The rest of the game plays off with just as much presentation and flair as we're used to from Relic in games like Homeworld and Impossible Creatures. Relic has shown they know how to make and present complete entertainment experiences and Dawn of War only emphasizes their grasp of what it takes to make a game more than just a game. Every battle players find themselves embroiled in can turn into a hardcore blood splattering fest of violence so brutal and crazy as to become almost gleeful in its gore spattered presentation.    There are a ton of great animations for the different attacks each of the units can make against their foes including some awesome ~finishing moves~ that leave victims bloody and broken. Each type of attack is signaled by size of the units (smaller units will attack up at bigger units instead of hacking at their ankles) so there is some semblance of proportion in the ruined cities and amongst the vehicles and soldiers. Some attacks are even reserved for certain types of units such as when one of the Space Marine heroes meets with the chaos daemon Bloodthirster.   The only problem I had with any of the presentation values of the game were the in-game cutscenes that drive the story. Animations in these cases were clunky and disjointed. I like the current idea of using the game engine to create cutscenes, but I'm looking forward to the time when the animations in these are fresh and more natural. Voice-overs were also pretty varied in quality. Some were okay, but others were pretty sad. I just can't get over an Inquisitor that's supposed to be hardcore, but sounds like George Takei. George Takei is not hardcore.   On the other hand, the thick cockney accents of the Orks sing out their playfully violent nature. They cuss, moan and lust for blood and they glory of battle and I loved every minute of it. In fact, the unit sounds and acknowledgements during the game are pretty good overall aside from the Space Marine and Chaos hero characters.   Relic has done a fine job making Dawn of War just as brutal and painful as players of Warhammer 40,000 would expect.   Now, those that are expecting the table top game come to life are going to have to put away those rulers and dice. Relic never had any intention of creating that kind of game and basically decided that they would mainly use the universe and table top game as a starting point with basic relationships between units remaining intact. For instance, one Space Marine would kick the crap out of one Ork. From that entry point, Relic worked to create an interesting gameplay experience that would make more sense in the Warhammer 40,000 fiction.     Thus they decided to take some basic ideas found in many RTSs and combine them into something not quite new, but unique in its delivery. The game comes out more tactical in nature than economic, but there is still a good amount of base building in order to get new units and upgrades as well as defend. But instead of mining for gold or some rare mineral, players will have to fight over strategic points. When captured, they give points with which to enlist new groups or pay for upgrades. Basically, the mothership is saying, ~hey you're doing a good job with what you have, here's some more.~ Because these are stationary points that have to be taken in order to gain ~money~ for new units, players have to be on the move and thinking about advancing in order to do well. It's been done in games like Ground Control II but that's fine with me. I really like this style of play, especially when combined with the intense savagery and thunder of constant conflict.   The only real problem can be getting to battles quickly because of some pathfinding issues. While units can find their way across the map pretty well, watching them try to fumble around in the midst of other units during a battle can be frustrating. The bounding boxes on each of the bigger units, especially the walkers such as the Space Marine Dreadnought, seem too big, meaning they can't fit through areas that they should be able to. Infantry units also get confused about which way to walk when in the middle of many vehicles.    The other main thing I should emphasize is that the gameplay works better in multiplayer than it does in the single player campaign. That's not to say that the campaign is bad... it's just not quite as fun with the way the gameplay is set up. You'll do the same things that you would in multiplayer and skirmish, but the AI will be much less aggressive as a whole when taking and holding capture points. I've found that if left alone, the enemy AI will attempt to begin new bases in odd areas, but that happened pretty seldom. The result is a fun campaign that isn't a huge challenge if you're patient about your progress since objectives don't push you to capture new points quickly.   I'm convinced that the real fun is in the skirmish and multiplayer. Depending on how you set the AI, skirmish can be quite the challenge. In fact, it can be downright impossible. Because of all of the little clicks that need to happen in squads to keep them manned and armed (you can add more members to a squad up to a certain number and arm them with bigger weapons), it can be a little overwhelming unless you're a ~clicks per minute~ type of guy. The computer obviously has a big advantage in managing all of the units at the same time and keeping them powered all the way up. Memorizing and using hotkeys is definitely going to make things easier and will probably be mandatory if you want to play against any good players online or against AI higher than easy.   Several different victory conditions can be used in each game to mix up how players will interact with the map and each other. One of my favorites is simply capture and hold, which means players have to capture a certain amount of critical locations on the map and hold them for six minutes in order to win. The catch is that the point that has to be defended can't be fortified with weapon emplacements like the other points of contention can. Several other modes are included that focus on the same kind of fast paced gameplay that forces players into the field rather than allowing them to sit and defend an area while other opponents slug it out.   Adding to the replay value are different races that have varied playing styles while remaining well-balanced. The ideas behind reinforcing and arming squads remain the same through many of the unit types, but the way you use them is completely different. Orks, for example, are much less powerful on a whole than the other races, but have a much, much higher unit cap using the Zerg swarm mentality. The Eldar, on the other hand, are a much more difficult race to master. Each of their squads can actually be upgraded into a different type of squad that has a very singular use while Space Marines have units and vehicles that have multiple uses for almost every situation. It'll be interesting to see how players end up adapting each of the races to their style of play.    Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is the first game in a long, long time that has even come close to doing the franchise justice. The fact that it hits the nail on the head isn't necessarily surprising; it's just been such a long wait that it's almost emotional. Everything from the drab and blasted landscapes to the perfectly realized models and varied animations make a perfect host for this ultra-violent future to inhabit.Nothing about the gameplay will really surprise anyone (though the addition of reinforceable squads is pretty neat) but it doesn't particularly matter. The factions are balanced very well, the battles are entertaining enough to make excitable gamers pee their pants, and the pace keeps players attention stuck to the screen at all times. Relic kicked ass creating a great piece of entertainment.", "date": "Sep 21, 2004"}
