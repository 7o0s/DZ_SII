It's a hefty task and World Tour Soccer 2003 made some strides ahead of World Tour Soccer 2002, but the bar has been raised by the competition so the pressure is on for World Tour Soccer 2005 to take its own game to the next level.    So the big question is whether or not World Tour Soccer 2005 has made enough significant changes to stand out on its own. It's certainly made a big effort in terms of being a global game with over 900 teams and 18,700 players from around the world and it provides a solid enough experience, but in terms of providing an entertaining experience, it continues to play third fiddle to the other two games that are already out there on the market.    Gameplay  All of the modes from World Tour Soccer 2003 are here such as the Exhibition Match, Season, Career, and Challenge modes. The Season and Career modes follow a regular team through a season or a high school team through a few years. These feature a series of games where the Exhibition and Challenge modes have just one. The Exhibition is there for a quick game against a friend or the computer, but the Challenge mode is where the true skill comes in.   In the Challenge mode, points are given for skillful ball handling, if you know what I mean. Show some skill with the passes, tackles, and the goals and you'll be rewarded for your kicking talents. It's only one match and it doesn't have an effect on the rest of the game, but it is a way to hone one's skills in a more quantitative way. Playing through these is close to a tutorial in terms of helping you to improve your skills and enhances the playability of the game.   To flesh out the world of World Tour Soccer 2005, hundreds of teams have been included and they all have varying strengths, but strangely enough there is no skill breakdown of the different teams. There is a five-star scale that shows the overall strength, but without a breakdown in terms of offense, defense, and teamwork, the overall number loses some of its meaning.     It's not like the information isn't there either, since each player is broken down into 26 different characteristics. To take so much information into account and then reduce it all into five stars is a bit ridiculous and takes away from the different characteristics of each team. It also makes it more interesting to pair up teams that are both have good offense, good defense, or of mixed abilities.   This lack of detail in the team descriptions is disappointing, but there is still plenty to dig through with unlockable teams and stadiums and thousands of possible matches to play. With hundreds of teams available, there's more than enough for a serious fan of soccer around the globe. The next big question is: How does it all play out? How does it actually feel to run the field?   Controlling the players on the field is like watching a live TV broadcast from around the world, there's a delay between most of the controls and what happens on the screen. The movements have lifelike animations and show plenty of motion capture work, but this also means that the animations need to run their course before the next command can be entered. Tapping a command like a pass or a kick effectively gets ~stacked~ in a queue and will be played out in a second or two.    Having the commands be a bit delayed takes some getting used to and can easily become frustrating if you change your mind about your plan of attack. If you can hit it fast enough, hitting the R3 button will cancel any moves in the queue. If not, it's easy to use too many moves and lose control. Hitting the circle button will block tackle when on defense and will shoot the ball when on offense. Tapping the circle button twice can possibly steal the ball and shoot it off into nowheresville in quick succession.     Aside from that hurdle, the rest of the game controls quite well. As a nifty addition to the franchise, there's now icon passing for goal kicks, corner kicks, free kicks, and throw-ins. Normal passing, facing a direction and throwing the ball, is still included, but icon passing assigns a face button to different players on the field and tapping the corresponding button will shoot the ball straight to them.    The extensive passing options and different offensive moves give more options than just running and passing. There's still a steep learning curve to understand just how these all work, but beyond that it deepens the gameplay and helps to make the game become more intricate and technical. Sadly, there's no tutorial mode to help learn the different moves and to introduce new players to the game so it's more of a trial by fire as you try out the different kicks and tricks and all the different fine points involved. World Tour Soccer 2005 is definitely targeted at gamers who have played soccer games before and want a more technical approach.    The lack of accessibility in World Tour Soccer 2005 is one of its biggest problems. There is plenty for experienced gamers to dig through and get out of it, but for others it's still a difficult point of entry. Even the menu system is done in a cold and distant manner with tiny gray type on a dark gray background. In a move to become the definitive and ultimate soccer game, World Tour Soccer 2005 provides a deep experience even if it's still a little clumsy around the edges in terms of control and accessibility.   Graphics  The graphical detail on the players is incredibly detailed for all of the players and coaches that get some face time in the game. The expressions can be wooden during the close-ups, but it's good to see a variety of ethnicities well-represented here. Beyond just different skin tones, there's a huge variety of facial structures in the pre-made characters and in the customizable characters. There are also plenty of detailed stadiums for all of the action to take place in. They're rarely seen during the action, but they're impressive in the opening ceremonies.   The camera, however, is a big disappointment in the lack of control or features. There's the possibility of a side view or an overhead view for the angle and three levels of zoom for the field of vision. It's also not possible to see the effect of the different views right away. To change the camera, it's necessary to go to a menu, change the settings, and return. To get a decent understanding of what's going on in the field, it's necessary to take a long shot and run with it. It would have been easier if there were more camera options and that they showed the results right away or were even changeable during gameplay either by the player or by the computer.    Sound  The two things that stand out are the crowd sounds and the commentary. A couple hundred different chants were recorded that provide atmosphere from around the world. With plenty of hoots and hollers included, there's plenty of atmosphere provided for all the different locales that are included. It may sound like an odd detail to pick out, but it provides the necessary flavor for a game that often focuses on the technical details.   As for the commentary, the voices have a hushed, reverential quality to them that did not get too old or annoying after hours of gameplay. It provided some extra information on the gameplay, but didn't stand out enough to become an audio thorn in one's side. With the game going on, I was able to listen for some good comments when I wanted to and focus on the moves when I didn't.  With the immensely massive pile of teams from around the world and a comprehensive move list, World Tour Soccer 2005 has all the ingredients for a solid title. Unfortunately, the pieces dont fit completely together and the delay in the control takes the blame for that one. Combine that with a basic camera that could be doing a lot more to show off the action and the experience loses a bit of its luster in practice. While there is so much that should be going right, the overall feeling left us a bit cold. The interface is difficult to wade through and there is little to welcome anyone who's new to the game. World Tour Soccer 2005 can be recommended for experienced players of soccer games who want to play with realistic teams from the past and present, but it lacks the polish and warmth that other titles on the market already provide. In a vacuum, World Tour Soccer 2005 would be great, but the bar's been raised and this franchise needs to take a few more steps up to meet the competition.", "date": "Apr 15, 2004"}
