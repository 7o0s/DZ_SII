Lots of guns. And explosions, and fireballs, and more bullets than you could ever possibly dodge. When you think of Treasure, you think of all of those things -- what you don't think of is role-playing.   Light Crusader is one of the few out-of-place oddballs in Treasure's classic gaming history. It's a game that completely breaks from every convention most normally associated with its developer -- known best for frenetic shooter experiences like Gunstar Heroes -- and replaces that status quo with more traditional, much slower-paced RPG gameplay. Light Crusader is a dungeon crawler, and a puzzle solver. There's not a spreadshot gun in sight.   David is the name of your valiant young warrior, a warrior whose vacation to the peaceful kingdom of Green Row is cut short by the sudden disappearance of several village citizens. Asked by the king to investigate, David sets off to explore the surrounding area and ends up discovering and entering a huge, multi-level dungeon.    Most of Light Crusader's adventure takes place as you guide David through the depths of this one expansive dungeon, fighting foes, solving puzzles and occasionally retreating back up to the surface to catch your breath and rest. The combat is the most straightforward piece of the design, as David's outfitted with traditional warrior equipment: a standard sword, an array of various health-restoring potions and food, and optional magic spells that function as long-range attacks. You can hack and slash away at blobs, goblins and overgrown sea creatures all day long, and you'll sometimes have to since certain rooms' locked doors won't open up until every baddie inside is made dead.   The swordplay feels limited, though, as you can really only execute two moves --a standard standing slash, and a diving lunge through the air. Hit detection is spotty on occasion with both, as you might find yourself getting tagged by an enemy just as you're trying to position yourself properly to strike at them with your blade, and the leaping lunge will oftentimes make you fly too far and miss the mark of your intended target.   Jumping is also hard to handle in other areas, too. Light Crusader uses an isometric perspective (also called the three-quarters viewpoint) which means everything's displayed at an angle. That kind of view can make it difficult to judge depth, which, in turn, can make it difficult to properly place your jumps (especially when the platforms you're jumping to are constantly moving). It's easier to make successful leaps in this game than it is in say, Landstalker, another isometric Genesis effort. But it's still not that simple.   Much of Light Crusader's puzzle-solving involves proper jumping, as well as exact placement of movable objects in certain dungeon rooms. You can shift and slide lots of different objects around just by walking into them (which is unintentionally comical, since you can move NPCs like the King and Queen around their throne room and push them off a cliff if you like), and moving weighted companion cubes onto pressure plates is a common activity. Some puzzles require a bit of trial and error, and you might find yourself having to leave a room and then re-enter it in order to reset an incorrectly solved puzzle.   Almost all of these elements are unique to Light Crusader, when compared with the rest of Treasure's back catalog of titles. But there is one aspect that it ends up having in common with its corporate cousins, particularly Gunstar Heroes -- mix and match magic. David can equip magic spells of the four normal elemental varieties, including Earth, Wind, Fire and Water. But, just like with the guns in Gunstar Heroes, he can also choose to combine two or more of the separate spells and create larger, more powerful sorceries. Winds alone projects out discs of slicing air into enemies, doing fair damage; but fuse together Wind and Earth magic and you'll access the more powerful (and flashier) lightning bolt attack. It's an element that gives some lasting depth to the design.So Light Crusader isn't lacking depth, and it's certainly home to a fair and playable isometric adventure. The thing that makes it seem just a little bland overall, though, is its contrast with the other much more notable and more energetic past games developed by the same company. Almost all of Treasure's other efforts in the 16-bit era where fast-paced shooters, immediately engaging and over-the-top from the first minute. Light Crusader isn't so instantly accessible, and actually takes quite a while to get into before you really feel like you're starting to have some fun. Weigh out your own level of potential commitment before making an investment in this one -- and if you find yourself unwilling to spend the cash here, think about grabbing one of Treasure's more explosive adventures instead.", "date": "Jan 28, 2008"}
