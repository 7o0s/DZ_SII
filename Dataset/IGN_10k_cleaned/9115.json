Other times, simple and addictive gameplay can turn the most basic game into a classic. Then there's Geon, a game that tries to hit both the flash and the addictive qualities that gamers so adore but winds up just missing the mark on both accounts. This puzzle action game from Stawdog Studios and Eidos is interesting enough for a few hours of fun, but ultimately doesn't have the addictive qualities that so many others like it possess.   Geon is another extension of the Pac Man style of game, as opposing players race to gobble up pellets scattered about the 3D board as fast as they can. After collecting a set number of pellets, you're required to flip over to the opponent's side of the board and race to the goal to score a point. This breaks up the action and creates the small bit of strategy Geon has. After scoring, you're whisked back to the same starting point on your side of the board which makes the order in which you collect the pellets rather important. An extra layer of depth is added with the powerballs which allow you to do such things as speed up or attack your opponent through the board. You can stack the powerballs to create a more powerful trap attack or simply carry them for a slight speed boost.    And that's as deep as the game gets.    At the beginning of each duel, each player selects an emotion to govern their little cube avatars. There's rage, fear, envy, melancholy and more to select from, each with a flashy little icon. The trouble is that the whole emotion concept is so loosely applied that it can't even approach gimmick status. The only difference between one emotion and the next is that each is aligned with a specific powerball. For example, Passion makes the powerslide powerball more effective, naturally. Waitwhat? The emotions don't really have anything to do with feelings at all and the only reason to choose one over another would be based on which powerball you like to use the most.    Plan your moves carefully or you may have trouble finding that last pellet at the end. But even that breaks down once you leave the duel mode and venture into other options. Time attack requires players to finish a level within set time limits. The opposing AI player is still present, but there really wouldn't be any reason to select an emotion aligned with attacking it when all you're trying to do is finish the level quickly.  Complete enough of these time attack challenges and you unlock some minigames. These don't require emotion selection at all as the goal is to simply collect all of the pellets while avoiding some moving obstacles as quickly as possible.   Where Geon does succeed is in its presentation of an otherwise middling game. There are 24 maps to test your dueling or time attack skills on, which range from fairly basic to quite intricate and smartly designed. The menus, and most of the game in fact, have a sleek, modern design that is quite well done for an XBLA game. The techno soundtrack isn't the greatest, but I guess it fits in with the whole concept of rolling a cube around on a theoretical electromagnetic wave that is held together under the force of its own gravity.   Once you've mastered the single player game, there are a few Xbox Live modes which allow you to test your merit against more suitable opponents. Sort of.  There are less than 5,000 players who have even downloaded Geon more than a week after its release and none of them seem to ever be looking for an online game. That may have something to do with the fact that Geon was released so close to Halo 3, but either way it doesn't bode well for the long term staying power of the community. Thankfully, in another smart presentation move, Geon is saved by the inclusion of offline split-screen play for all of its multiplayer modes. Along with the standard duel mode are a team duel and a last man standing mode for four players.  Geon has the look and feel of an 800 Microsoft Point ($10 USD) XBLA game, but one would hope to get something a little more engaging for that amount of money. Developer Strawdog Studios was clearly aiming for a game that is easy to pick up and play, but in the end made a game that is equally easy to simply walk away from.  The board design is solid. Everything around the game is well designed, with a good feature set and an attractive style. Unfortunately, that style doesn't extend into the game itself which is a real missed opportunity.", "date": "Sep 27, 2007"}
