When we wanted to shoot something, we didn't pick up a gun - geez, you wouldn't believe how much trouble we would've gotten in if Mom saw something like that.  No, we didn't shoot things with guns.  We shot stuff with spaceships.  There were some famous spaceships way back when, but we'll always remember one of the first ones to have a name: the legendary Vic Viper.  Konami's pride and joy in the early Reagan administration, the Viper shot up his share of bad guys in his prime, wasted everything from big-ass germs to giant floating Easter Island heads and came back for more.  Good ol' Vic.  Wonder where he's been all these years?  Gradius, for the younguns, is one of the oldest classic shooter series, having originated in the arcades back in the early-to-mid 80s and subsequently developed a console following on the MSX, Famicom, and Nintendo Entertainment System.  The original Gradius and its sequel, Life Force, both made it to the NES, and Gradius III subsequently saw a cracker of a home port released in the early days of the Super Nintendo, but after that the flow of Gradius ceased.  Gradius IV did its thing in Japanese arcades, but due to evident technical difficulties, it never made it home to the PlayStation or any other console.  Now it's finally home, on a console that can very clearly do justice to the arcade original, and it's got an exact arcade port of its cousin Gradius III in tow (since the SNES version was just this side of perfect).  I think it's pretty safe to say that the Emotion Engine isn't terribly taxed by the demands placed upon it by Konami's retro collection, but serious shoot-em-up fans will not, as they say, be counting.  This is Gradius.  You want some Gradius?  Come get some Gradius.  Gameplay  Gradius' weapon system relies on just one type of power-up, but you can enhance your Vic Viper craft with five or six different types of weapons - a speed boost, missiles, double shots, laser beams, Options, shields, and more.  The way it works is simple.  Your upgrades are listed in linear sequence, and each time you grab a power-up (left by certain types of enemies) it moves the highlighted upgrade forward once.  One power-up highlights the speed boost, two the missiles, three the double, and so on.  Once the upgrade you want is lit, you hit a button and buy it, so to speak, which sends your count of power-ups back to the bottom.  This way, you can use several upgrades at once: boost your speed, equip missiles, go from shots to lasers, power up your defensive shields, and send out a few Options.  Options, for the unversed, are little satellite globes that act like a second ship.  An Option orbits you according to a pattern you choose and fires the same shots as your Viper, with the added bonus that touching an enemy does it no harm at all.  Thus, one of the more advanced strategies in the game is learning how to use your Options as both a shield and a weapon.  Gradius III actually contains the friendlier weapon system of the two, with its Edit Mode and selectable weapon loadouts.  Both games let you pick from a pre-set selection of specific weapons for each type (six loadouts in IV, four in III), but III actually lets you design your own loadout from a grid of weapons, Options, and so forth.  Some of the Option configurations seem to be missing, though, perhaps because this is a port of the arcade version rather than the SNES port - if anyone can find the two-up two-down wing Option setup, let me know, because that was my clear favorite when I was younger.  Once you pick out the weapons system that suits you best, it's time to head out and die.  Yes, die.  You die an awful lot in Gradius, and there's no arcade-style automatic continuing - failure kicks you back to the last level checkpoint.  99 out of 100 latter-day gamers will be beaten stupid by the difficulty level in either Gradius, demanding as it does twitch responses and pattern memorization that most game designers have long since ceased to require from their audience.  This is Ol-Skool Gaming, where only persistence and a careful eye are rewarded by a trip to the next level.  The PS2's analog control is an aid, though, providing ease of movement that you couldn't get from a control pad.  Graphics  C'mon.  What do you expect?  Between them, these games have almost thirteen years of life to their credit.  Gradius IV is actually fairly young, having made its debut in 1998, but it was still a bit behind the curve back then (I'm not sure what arcade hardware it ran on, but I'm guessing some derivative of the PlayStation).  Even so, IV features some big bosses and detailed backgrounds as you shoot your way further into the game, and there are some very cool textures and highlighting on stuff like the dragons from the first level, as well as lighting effects from energy weapons.  Gradius III stands out in a couple of moments as well: for example, it actually has a bigger, more animated Vic Viper.  Sound  The Gradiusic Cyber track from Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix has given me a new appreciation for the classic Gradius tunes, but unremixed these are still just 16-bit shooter music.  Which is nothing to sneeze at, since there were some darn catchy tunes cut loose by the old SNES sound chip back in the day, but they're a faint echo of what you here in games in general today and even more recent shooters like Ray Crisis or Silpheed.  I wouldn't necessarily turn to these games for their soundtracks, unless you're a serious retro enthusiast. But so what if they're years old?  These are still both excellent shooters - the Gradius weapon design has withstood the test of time - and the arcade ports are perfect, even including the bootup RAM and ROM check screens just before the main titles.  Gradius III and IV is certainly a purely retro affair, aimed only at a small enthusiast market, but it's retro gaming done properly, a package that's worth the money to its target audience (hey, you would have paid 60 bucks for just Gradius III back in the day).  May I suggest a Castlevania collection for a follow-up?  Parodius, maybe?  How about Twinbee?  And hey, the home port of Super Contra wasn't quite perfect...", "date": "Nov 16, 2000"}
