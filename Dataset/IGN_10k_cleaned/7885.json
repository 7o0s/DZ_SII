Rafa Nadal Tennis, however, isn't blessed with such intuitive controls, especially if you choose to make the most of the DS and play with the stylus. Whereas Nintendo's knockabout is so easy to pick up and play anyone of any age can grab a controller and string a rally together, learning to play competently is a headache that only eases after hours of practice here.   Take serving for exmaple: in practice it sounds simple enough - the length of time you hold the stylus on the touchscreen determines power, then you stroke it in the direction you want the shot to go. In execution, however, it's a totally different story because it proves a pretty inaccurate method of aiming a shot, resulting in balls that are played too deep or too wide because the stylus movement was was a fraction too long.   Even on the easiest setting, winning a game - let alone an entire set - is a challenge few will succeed in, despite your player automatically moving into position. On the hardest setting it's even more of a nightmare because the stylus is used to move the player as well as take a shot, so to return a serve you must first position your player by tapping the screen, then take the shot by swiping the stylus across the touchscreen. All in a split-second. Winning Wimbledon has got to be easier than this.   Thankfully the traditional D-pad controls are far more intuitive, with Nadal playing a lot like Virtua Tennis, only on DS. To play a stroke shot you simply press the A button; X if you want to lob; B to add topspin and Y to play a 'special' shot, such as a hard, low volley. Aiming couldn't be simpler either: hold the D-pad in the direction you want the ball to go, additionally pressing down to play it short and up to hit a long baseline shot. Similarly to Virtua Tennis, the longer you hold the shot button down - by quickly getting into position and charging up the stroke - the more powerful the shot is.   Anyone familiar with SEGA's long-serving (baddum-tish) tennis series will pick up Nadal in an instant and will likely breeze through the training and quick matches in their first couple of goes. Even inexperienced players will learn how to accurately play a power shot in a matter of minutes, such is the instant appeal of the game.   That's not to say Rafa Nadal Tennis lacks depth or is too easy. The initial matches, especially in quick play, are just a taster of what to expect later in the game, with the pros you face in the latter stages of the career mode serving up a firm but fair challenge. Having said that, some of the returns they make do seem a little on the miraculous side, with this reviewer momentarily glancing away from the screen after playing what seemed like an impossible-to-reach smash, only for the opponent to leap across the court, arms outstretched, and return the shot. Thankfully it doesn't happen too often, but make sure you don't lose concentration until the point has been notched up on the scoreboard.    Starting on the bottom rung of the world rankings, the objective of the career mode is to make it all the way to the top, by competing in tournaments around the world to increase your seeding. With each victory comes a pile of cash, which can be used to buy new equipment such as racquets and clothing. More importantly, every win awards a player with experience credits, which can be manually assigned to improve the different areas of your player's game, such as their serve, forehand, backhand, smash and also running speed. You're therefore free to develop your player however you see fit, creating a good all-rounder like Federer (but NOT Federer, seeing as the only licensed player in the game is Rafa himself) or pouring all your experience points into one or two individual areas.   There are 20 tournaments in total, set across 17 different locations, plus there's the option to team up with AI players and compete in doubles tournaments. Additionally, the ball reacts differently on grass as it does on clay and hard courts, although in our experience not so much that you need to change tactics to suit the surface you're playing on.    While career doubles games are enjoyable they really come into their own in multiplayer, which is part of the game that Rafa Nadal gets pretty much spot on. For starters, you only need a single cart to play (albeit a stripped-down version) the multiplayer game. And while all the players and courts are unlocked if you play with two or more carts (up to four players can play at the same time, even off a single cart), there's more than an enough variety if there's only one copy of the game to go round.Overall then, Rafa Nadal Tennis is a decent game. Visually its nothing special  while the player animations are good, the detail is painfully lacking in the close-ups, although its not really that apparent in the middle of a rally. Likewise theres nothing that's standout about the gameplay, but it does serve up a solid game of tennis thats easy to pick up but has enough depth to keep you coming back. The multiplayer is the highlight though, especially because four people can play using a single copy of the game, and more than makes up for the clunky stylus control, which feel like an ill-conceived afterthought.", "date": "Jan 5, 2007"}
