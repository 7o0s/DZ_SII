For some, it was the adventure. For others, it was the science. For me, well, it was the fact that Hunstville is the site of the oldest hardware store in Alabama or the Twickenham Historical District. After playing this game, I'm glad I didn't go. If space camp was this much fun, I'd have killed myself. And what's the deal with putting the kids in that big, spinning harness? That didn't even look like fun when I was 12.  Apollo 18 picks up where the historical Apollo missions left off. When last we left NASA, Apollo 17 had just returned with 240lbs. of precious moon rocks. Then somebody remembered that we already had rocks here on Earth-rocks we could get without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. So they scrapped the program. Apollo 18 is its fictional continuation. You are put at the controls of a Saturn V multi-stage rocket. You operate both the Command Module (CM) and the Lunar Lander (LM).  This game is astonishingly accurate and, as a result, is also pretty dry. It's a great example of how ultra-realism can kill a game. It seems space flight is surprisingly boring. I found myself spending a lot of time going through the routines of space flight without ever feeling connected to what I was doing. I felt totally disconnected from the idea of space flight.  I began with the Training disk. Technically this should be called the Orientation disk as the entire training program is on the Mission disk. We'll get to what I'd prefer to call the training program later. This disk has some NASA official talk you through the different systems on Apollo 18 and give you an overview of the whole space flight program. Take notes. Everything on this disk will be part of your Astronaut tests.  The Training disk functions like little more than a glossary really. I felt better use could be made of real practical discussion of the workings of the spacecraft components. Tell me how it works, in other words. Basically, everything here was far too general given what you're expected to know once you get to the training levels. And when you hit a rough spot in training and come back to review the orientation, it's very hard to find specific information.  On top of everything else, the training disk doesn't look so hot. The video sequences, and there are a lot of them, have a bad TV reception quality to them. For some reason, the training disk must be played in 256 color, 640x480 mode. The mission disk must be played in 16bit or true color. What's the story? Even when I followed those restrictions, the game still did some bizarre things to my Windows displays. Rebooting always fixed the problem, however.  Anyway, so I move on to the mission disk. Here you have two options. You can go right to the launch pad (yeah, good luck) or you can go to the Johnson Space Center, which I now know is the central location for all manned spacecraft training activities. And now, so do you. This is supposedly authentic astronaut training. Well..., simulated-authentic at least. There are two kinds of evaluations and 3 levels of training. Testing, really.  First, I have to take a true/false test. 20 questions based on the Saturn V and the space flight program. So I figure, I'm reasonably intelligent, I've seen The Right Stuff about a hundred times (and once dubbed in French with Spanish subtitles), I can take this test. No problem. Well, it took me over 6 tries just to guess enough of them correctly that I could actually get in the simulator.  Once I was past the written test, it was a breeze. It was almost too easy. The guy at Mission Control is constantly giving you instructions. ~O-2 flow on, check O-2 gauge, main bus on, check SPS display, blah, blah, blah, I'm so great...~ I was beginning to feel like Karen Black being talked down by George Kennedy in Airport '75. This constant stream of instructions makes the game seem too much like a routine. Even in the moments when you lose signals, you still have the flight plan in front of you. So you always know what to do next. They really baby you through the whole process. The only time you'll blow it is when you can't find the right button in time.  Once you pass the first few simulators, it's time for another test and a new batch of simulations. At this point I really began to question the labeling of this as a training exercise. There's no briefing, no explanation, and no follow up. Basically, you go into the simulator and the guy at MC starts telling you what to do. You have a certain number of incorrect guesses before you're booted out of the simulator. Plus there's a time limit. At over 2700mph, you better know how to find the Tank Heater button in a few seconds. If you fail, you fail without any explanation.  Then there's the third level with another test and more simulators. I gave up at this point and went right to the launch pad.  The controls for the Apollo 18 are very realistic. No joysticks or lasers here. Not even any windows. The ship is flown from as many as ten separate panels. Most of these are just rows of buttons. Each button corresponds to some vital craft component. When called upon to do so, you have to switch to correct panel and engage the specific buttons needed for each stage of flight.  There are a few situations where you will have to improvise. Occasionally, you will experience LOS, or Loss of Signal. This means that the radio has gone dead due to malfunction or interference. In these cases you'll have to rely on your flight plan and pray that your timing is perfect. There are some sequences of the game, however, that you are never prepared for. Landing on the moon is a great example. You get no help either in orientation or training. It's up to you to figure out how the controls work.   There are even, unplanned random mission events. The unexpected loss of power in a crucial system may mean you'll soon be sorry you weren't nicer to your family, maybe even gone to see your grandparents a little more often. As luck would have it, the flight plan has cue cards for these emergencies. They're called Solutions. Fire on board? Let's see, that's a CM Solution..., Item P504..., Ah, here we are, system fire! Step 1: Check Master Alarm and C&W, CSM 2,3. Kay. Step 2: Check SPS Data, CSM 2. Did that. Step 3: Check ECS...ah, screw it. Maybe the fire will just burn itself out.  I have to say that the flight plan is the best part of this game. I normally don't go in for the, and I quote from the box, ~Comprehensive, 208 pages technical manual,~ but this time it's truly useful. The manual is mostly a reference guide however. It provides the flight plan for the mission. It's a step by step breakdown of nearly every procedure needed to carry out your mission. NASA is big on procedure by the way; the lift off sequence alone has over 24 blocks of two or three steps each. Well over 50 separate actions just to blast off.  The flight plan is supposed to be a fairly authentic replica of a real Apollo flight plan. While it does definitely look like a game manual, it helped me get into the game more than anything in the game itself. In addition to the cue cards and mission solutions, there are reference sections, including a small lunar map and a glossary.  Assuming that you can make it through the whole mission, what do you get? Well, you get the usual awards and patches. Maybe a nice certificate. Who knows? The Apollo 18 mission is the only mission on this disk. in all fairness there are a lot of different mission events here-launch, lunar landing, lunar liftoff, docking, reentry, etc.-and there are even random mission events-control system failure, engine shutdown-that will make the experiences different. I do know that there are 30 different mission endings. I imagine they range from oversleeping and missing the launch to skipping the moon entirely, going straight on to Pluto and fighting off wave after wave of rampaging sexbots.  Once you have completed the Apollo 18 mission, you can buy further missions from AIM. That's right, you can pay to fly the Apollo program into the late 70s! Fly the Apollo 19, 20, etc. These missions will also involve ancient lunar mysteries, things supposedly kept classified by the US government.  I can say that after playing this game, I have an astoundingly intimate knowledge of the Saturn V and the craft modules. I'm almost tempted to watch Apollo 13 again. After all, I couldn't land on the damn moon either. But I really understand what the control system is like and can trade acronyms with the best of them now. ~No! The SPS JET must be fired prior to TOI and the IMU's no good after that!~ Do I know what it means? You tell me.  So I learned a lot about the Apollo spacecraft but I didn't really have any fun. The game may be very realistic but that ruined the experience. It got boring staring at panels of buttons. Apart from the odd cinematic or arcade sequence, the game was too static. Although there are some readouts and graphic displays on the panels, these were generally confusing and I couldn't do much to make them change. The arcade sequences looked really out-of-date and the movements were jerky. I know from the box that there are some decent looking external views in the game but these occur only at specific mission events and were few and far between in my opinion.  Ever since man has stared up at the heavens he has dreamed of spending 4 days hunched over a row of buttons, punching them at the direction of some guy in Texas just so you can bring back some rocks. Come on. Let's go find those sexbots!  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "May 24, 1999"}
