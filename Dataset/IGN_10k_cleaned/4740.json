{"name": "Star Trek: Shattered Universe", "name_review": "Star Trek: Shattered Universe", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/03/star-trek-shattered-universe", "text": "Curiosity killed the cat and trapped three Federation starships in some kind of blasted space vortex. While apparently doing something of no significance, the USS Ranger gets stuck in a spatial anomaly. To its aid rushes the USS Enterprise, led by Commander Checkov. It promptly gets stuck as well. To its aid comes the mighty USS Excelsior, led by Captain Sulu. Instead of getting stuck like the others, he ineptly manages to fly through the spatial anomaly and into a parallel universe (as seen in Star Trek, the original series, and two episodes of Deep Space Nine, if memory serves). He, his ship, and crew have all been ~transposed,~ which means Sulu now sports a cool scar above his right eye.   The mirror universe mission: get to another anomaly across the sector to escape back into the normal Star Trek universe. ~Captain, wouldn't that put us too far away from the original anomaly to help the Ranger and the Enterprise, like we were originally supposed to?~ To the brig with you, sensible one!  It's no wonder Shattered Universe's interpretation of the Excelsior finds itself in such a predicament. As the game sees it, the ship is a giant piece of crap commanded by a complete and total idiot. Instead of flying around and shooting enemies with weapons that do damage, it idly sits about, fires off the equivalent of sparklers, and gets shot until it dies, assuming players -- in their totally un-Star Trek fighter craft -- can't save the giant beached whale time and again.  This is Shattered Universe, a game that's more cheaply done Colony Wars than it is any kind of discernable Star Trek or any kind of appreciable cool.   Click for Screens  Play involves the application of exactly zero skill only because our effort determiner does not plummet into the negative. It is necessary throughout the title's 20 or so missions to shoot and kill many things, but this is no more challenging than depressing buttons with fingers and keeping the analog sticks relatively taut. If you are prone to convulsing, you might have trouble playing through this one. Even frequently obliterating the title's capital ships five at a time requires little more than thrusting toward an opponent while holding down all fire buttons -- only letting off the phaser burst long enough to launch a torpedo -- and then reversing away while still holding all fire buttons. Repeat this process while wiggling the roll stick and you shall be unstoppable. This is great because Captain Puppet Monkey can't use his state-of-the-art starship to do anything but die miserably.  Interspersed throughout the game -- after every mission and often before every other -- come cutscenes. They are quite awful in that loveably laughable failed art project sort of way. Sulu appears to be a happy resident of Ape-opolis, the prominent city in Planet of the Apes we cannot remember the official name of. (He could also be from Chimp-ton, the nearby town.) Captain Puppet Monkey sports a massive brow, cheeks Skeletor would fear, and one of those fat grass eating monkey-mouths. His only non-ape attributes are his nearly immovable jaw and his less-animated-than-Pinocchio-before-he-was-instilled-with-life demeanor. Still, the incompetent bastard is somehow capable of coherent speech, however dry and monotonous it is. He can somehow propel his lifeless voice through the air by maneuvering his lower jaw up and down, but that doesn't change his complete worthlessness.   Unfortunately, he is about as Star Trek as Star Trek: Shattered Universe ever gets. Vessels, be they Constitution Class, Excelsior, Miranda, or Klingon Bird of Prey, all appear vastly underpowered and way too small. Instead of beginning with hails and the prerequisite attempt at peace that Star Trek necessitates, we also just find ourselves shooting at Klingons and anything else as soon as it shows up. Pump it up, dude. Beat that dead horse! It was either necessary or decided by force that music would not be Trek at all -- a terrific plan if you're into wacky beats that shift from arcade background tunes to that stuff the local pornographer has looping endlessly through his demented head.      Even when provided an infinite well of fiction from which to draw people and things and actions, the developers decided to include absolutely nothing of substance. There is no background information on any of the ships to be acquired (which are all appropriately uninteresting) and there is no real reason or drive to continue playing other than to enjoy the satisfaction that comes with shooting down twenty fighters in successive waves and four capital ships while Sulu chimes in with the occasional, ~Good shooting, pilot~ and ~Another wave of fighters is approaching.~   Why stop with not being Trek by failing to implement Trek when you can actually create new crap that makes your game even less like Star Trek than before? Huh, why? It's a good question someone asked someone else -- a good question that led to the design of new ships better attached to drills and arrows than this space setting. One even resembles a broken shard off the planet devouring Crystalline Entity. Each is as mundane and out of place as possible, implying the developers realized their game was as far from the fiction as possible and decided to do something about it by making this stretch seem intentional.  You won't notice any of this, though. You'll be too busy focusing on preventing the onset of a coma. Third and first-person dog fighting is about as trivially boring as possible. You'll get shot and not fear death, enjoy pointless scrolling colors that double as nebulae, and navigate the occasionally strong gravitational field that demands no attention be paid to it. To make your experience better, feel free to quit if you don't like the sound or brightness or controls. There are no in-game options, so quitting is mandatory.   We can understand the exclusion of such configurables from within missions, for if there were in-game options, players might be presented with something more attractive to look at than the actual game. Certainly it runs well enough. Breezing by a docked Excelsior perched dangerously close to a hostile star base at uncharacteristically slow speeds is vaguely interesting, but would only be impressive had every single effect in the title not been made to look as awful as possible. Phaser fire is an angular assemblage of poorly done polygons and explosions amount to large orange blobs for fighters and giant white clouds for capital ships, which conveniently evaporate as soon as the cloud dissipates. Freespace from 1998 still holds the space-sim explosion crown and Colony Wars, a PSOne game from 1997 still dominates the genre on consoles in terms of gameplay, storyline, audio, and fun. How is this possible? Learn, damn you! I am a devout fan of the space combat simulator / action title and each passing year is another ton of bricks dropped onto my already dying heart. Select few titles come along while burgeoning and flailing publishers alike explain away the lack of such games to poor sales. Here's a hint, game dudes: if your stupid game is as fun as watching a pet die, as attractive as an eight-legged dwarf, and as generally cool as getting your chest ruptured by an angered moose, it's bloody well not going to sell or be critically-freaking-acclaimed! Respect Shattered Universe not for any of its qualities that it does not have, but rather for how games like Bridge Commander, Tie Fighter, Colony Wars, Starlancer, Darklight Conflict, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer, and even the poorly controlling monstrosity that was Rogue Squadron can pass by and teach this one absolutely nothing at all.", "date": "Jun 3, 2004"}
