What's amazing is that the game is unrivalled. No one has even attempted football in this style at all on console of arcade for ages, until Midway blew everyone away. Blitz is a brand new take on one of America's favorite sports, bringing quicker play-calling, seriously illegal (and immortal) tackles, and a great sense of control and speed like never before.  The differences between Madden/Gameday and Blitz are massive, and yet the game works brilliantly on levels that those games simply can't touch. NFL Blitz brings seven players from each team to the gridiron for a sans-rules football massacre. For example, gamers must drive 30 yards instead of 10 for a first down. While this might sound ridiculous, in Blitz it makes sense. Thirty yards is actually pretty easy with the 18 different offensive plays and a handful of variations on them. Unlike traditional football, pass interference is not illegal  it's a strategic part of defense and a hell of a lot of fun. Your player has a turbo boost (the equivalent of a humungous, instant hormone injection), and forward laterals don't mean squat  anyone in this game can pass, and well.   The game is out for both PSX, N64, and will soon be available on PC. The difference is in the graphic look (N64 and PC  have the edge), and in the kinds of modes (N64 has a great play editor, while the PSX has a multiplayer tournament mode). Obviously, the PC will be the best looking and fastest of them all.  Blitz makes football accessible to anyone  men, women, people who don't give a damn about football. It's as fun as a watching 90-yard touchdown run, a 60-yard bomb from Steve Young to Jerry Rice, or a nuzzling up to a Cowboys cheerleader in full regalia. (If you haven't done that last one, it's truly unrivalled.) The game is still strategic and well-balanced, and remains football at its core, and it makes football more fun than it's ever been, or is supposed to be.After playing way too much of arcade NFL Blitz, I must admit to being a huge addict of the coin-op and the concept of ~arcade football.~ So I was bound to love Blitz anyway. But Midway is still a felon of fudging its own ports, so this one was up in the air. The final verdict is that Midway nailed this on the head. PSX Blitz amazed us in look, speed, and playability without losing the speedy flair of the coin-op powered by a powerful PC engine and loads of RAM.There are little differences in this version. Gone is the foul-mouthed language (What the F@ck is going on?~), and a few other little rants. But new ones are in their place, such as ~With the circus catch~ when receiving a great pass, and ~And stay down~ after a massive tackle. New tackle animations appear as well, in addition to the fantastic pile driver, wind-up-and-throw, and gang tackles while players are down.The biggest differences occur in the camera perspective, passing game, and money plays. The camera is fixed much farther out than before, causing players to appear smaller, and probably keep the frame rate in the high 20s. That didn't bug me a bit. The passing game, however, is either not perfectly tested, or balanced out for gameplay. On short passes with the turbo depressed, quarterbacks overpass screens and hand-offs by 15 or so yards. This simply didn't happen in the coin-op. It's not that big of a deal, but when it counts later in the game, it can be frustrating to hurl a post pattern when you actually called a screen-pass. Finally, the overall gameplay is far more balanced than the arcade, so that money plays (right slants, splits, sub-zero, and super fly, among others) simply work as well. The AI is souped-up, just like a real football team, to adjust to too many of one play. This forces gamers to learn more plays and get better at the game.All in all, this is my favorite football game of the year. With the exception of Gran Turismo and Goldeneye 007, I haven't wasted this much time on a game in a long, long time.", "date": "Sep 12, 1998"}
