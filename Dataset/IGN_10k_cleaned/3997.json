But if sales charts have anything to do with it, we won't see the precipitation of traditional platformers coming round for some time now. Naughty Dog, well known now for its 2 1/2D platform series Crash Bandicoot on PlayStation (OK, we admit, Naughty Dog has its big commercial breakthrough with the ~seminal~ Way of the Warrior on 3DO), has sunk its teeth into the genre again.   But this time, it's torn up everything in the process. Where Jak and Daxter was a deep, seamless platformer with gorgeous graphics and a staid Disney-like comedy routine, Jak II is essentially an entirely new creature. Or at least that's what the clever kids at Naughty Dog are shooting for. Layering in a massive Grand Theft Auto-like open city, jack-able cars and a living, breathing populace on top of a platform game gone mad, Jak II is like a teenage platform game that's discovered drugs for the first time. A teenager who, all of a sudden, enjoys sex, drugs and rock 'n roll -- who enjoys guns, a dark, twisting storyline, and a platform experience that is running away from its roots as fast and hard as possible. What's next? A green goatee? Oh wait...   The Story  While we're at it and we're going for the teenage analogy, who are we, really? What is Jak II, really? A platformer, or a character-action game? An adventure game? An action-platformer? These questions have crossed our lips time and again, and the jury has not yet returned, but it's clear that we need to make up something new quick. (My suggestions - Plactioner, or how about Actionformer? To be continued...)    The point is this -- Jak II, undeniably born from platform roots, is an expansion of the genre. And a very polished, pretty and, thankfully, harder one at that. It all starts with the story, so let's pick it up there. The game begins with a long cutscene following the travails of Jak and Daxter at the end of their first adventure. To make a long story short, Jak and Daxter, Samos and Keira are shot into the future and split apart. They land on a seeeimingly new planet, but it's really their on world in the future.    Jak is taken away from Daxter, thrown into custody by new character Baron Praxis, the tyrannical 1984-ish ruler of Haven City, where they have landed. Two years pass as Jak is experimented on and pumped full of dark Eco. Daxter finally finds Jak and frees him, and then proceeds to watch as his buddy, unable to control the chemical changes that now take place in his body, turns into an Eco Hulk and wreaks havoc on the city's Crimson Guards.   The affect on Jak is that he's not only mad, filled with anger and rage at his unfair imprisonment and even less fair torture, but that he's changed. He can talk, he's not so friendly, he likes to break things, and what's more, he wants to fight. This, of course, is just the set up, the initial storyline, but it works on a few levels. Not only does Naughty Dog establish right away that this is not your ordinary platform game, it then proceeds to tell you a story worth listening to.     It's not the first time a platformer has had a worthwhile story (I'd say that Ratchet and Clank and Jak and Daxter both delivered solid stories before), but it is the first time in the genre's history that the story has taken the lead. That it's actually important, crucial to the way the game is played. Unlike pretty much every other platformer in the world (not including the upcoming,  exceptionally good Ratchet and Clank Going Commando), the story here is filled with characters who you'll either love or hate. It's the story that gives this game the feeling that it's an adventure, like Indiana Jones or even Max Payne. Jak is far more likeable now that he speaks, and that fact that he's pissed off and owns honking big guns weaves in an unmistakable new level of emotion into the narrative.      Along those same lines, Daxter is once again the comedic sidekick. Ready to unleash a flurry of obnoxious one-liners, bad jokes, and rambling monologues in every cutscene, Daxter perfectly pigeonholes himself into the role of the dislikeably adorable neighborhood friend. You love him but you wish he'd just grow up a little. This time around, however, Daxter is the vehicle for new thematic elements. He gets drunk, ogles girls' boobs, tries bad pick up lines on said females, and basically embarrasses Jak with his deliciously bad taste. Is he funny? He provides humor in the most basic sense, but it's ~ha-ha~ funny, not actually something that makes you instinctively laugh out loud. You know the punch line is coming, you know he's going to say it, the only thing missing is the laugh track.    I'll keep the storyline particulars to a minimum because they're a crucial part of the game, but suffice it is to say, Jak II, which clocks in between 15-25 hours depending on your skill level, spins a captivating yarn. The story is packed with revealing characters, twists and surprises. There's the Baron and his suspicious relationship with the Metal Heads, Kor, the ancient, and his strange longing for an artifact, and a triangle in the making between Jak, Keira and the Baron's daughter, Ashelia. Naughty Dog doesn't keep too many things hidden for long, and with not-so-subtle speeches and curious conversations, players can discern the bad guys from the good ones without needing much external help.    Gameplay  Unlike the collect-a-thon approach from yesteryear, Jak II follows a narrative, but an open design. Again taking its cue from Grand Theft Auto, Naughty Dog enables players to choose their missions from a variety of people. Players will meet Torn, an underground commander, Krew, an unethical, triple-chinned, heavy-breathing Jabba-like dude on a hovercraft, Sig, the warrior, Brutter, the Lurker market merchant, and many more characters from which Jak can pick up missions.   The mission variety is solid, mixing up traditional platform set ups with a good assortment of shooter levels. There is the occasional ~protect the caravan~-style mission, and some familiar chase missions (like in Jak and Daxter 1), and there is a heavy dose of GTA-like missions. These involve obstacle races, stealing vehicles, timed races, and rescues, and they work well. Thankfully, the game difficulty has definitely been upped, so players will not breeze through the game in one day like before. I clocked in at 21-plus hours the first time through and I hadn't opened up all the secrets or collected all the precursor eggs (which is an insane goal anyway). What's more, they won't be bored either. If it's not the story driving players into action, it's side quests, exploration of the city, or the racing challenges.     Oh, and did I mention how cool the vehicle jacking is? It's killer. The vehicles all travel on two heights, so when Jak needs to steal one, and he's under it, an icon appears telling you it's ready to be jacked. Gamers press Triangle and they jump up to the vehicle and hang on its side, and then they press Triangle again and hop into the driver seat. The vehicles all drive with the same feel as the wacky vehicle from the first Jak and Daxter. Only this time, there are about 10 different kinds, some slow and durable, some fast and which instantly explode on impact. Players can also steal guard vehicles, the biggest of which has its own mounted weapon (but it moves like a frickin' bus).     The addition of weapons makes a huge difference in the game's play (guh). Superbly blending in gun fighting with platform melee, Naughty Dog has created a truly beautiful hybrid action platform game (~actionformer!~). The controls are spot-on -- Jak moves with a grace and smoothness that's unmatchable. He switches from attacking, spins and lunges, to handling a rifle, shotgun and mini-gun with gorgeous ease. The mish-mash of moves and guns creates intense combat scenarios unlike any other game of its kind. You can shoot enemies from afar, run up and then smack them using the traditional spin attack, or you can hammer them with the butt of your gun. And it's different from Ratchet and Clank because these are traditional weapons, not Gloves of Doom. So, your rifle has a thing red line of sight to aim by. The shotgun delivers up an awesome, powerful boom (it's a boomstick, all right), and the mini-gun rattles you like a jack hammer. And yes, in a move that's sure to bring fans a smile, Daxter is playable. But what's most humorous about it is that his first mission is in a Crash Bandicoot boulder chasing tunnel!   The civilian AI is tame, which is to be expected, but if you mistakenly or on purpose kill a civilian, the guards come after you. I found the enemy AI to be consistently good, give or take a few questionables. Nearly every time I hid when the guards were alarmed, they found me most times. They're not dumb. Plus, there is a never-ending stream of them, and of course, they can be alerted when you're in the middle of a mission. What I especially liked was the healthy variety of enemies. There are just so many different kinds, and the best thing is they fight -- firing off blue fireballs or charging you head-on -- in vastly different ways.   I will say that while the GTA-missions are a good change of pace from the traditional collection mentality, Naughty Dog's giant city does have its drawbacks. Haven City is littered with people and their vehicles, almost none of whom say anything (or anything interesting) to you, and who jam pack the streets. The large city is awesome, that's not a complaint. (In fact, Jak often explores outside the city into ~unchartered~ areas). The highly irregular streets, none which have parallel lines, and which are always full, make traversing from one point to another a logistical nightmare. You can never just punch it and blaze through the streets with reckless abandon. You're bound to mash into or kick a civilian by mistake or set off the guards, and the regularity of this city's patterns, of the guards' redundant dialog, of the colorlessness of the city's personality, does come across. After 15 hours of going back and forth from Torn to Crew to whomever, slogging through traffic is not what I want to do. And while Jak II does its best to imitate or borrow from GTA, it's not as nearly good in these respects.   Which brings up another point, the jetboarding. The jetboard sections are probably my least favorite. The jet board controls are solid, the numerous moves are surprising, but in the same way that the GTA-stuff doesn't entirely work, the jet board levels left something to be desired. It's like Tony Hawk lite on a hoverboard, or if you've played it, Airblade. Meh. To be honest, having the hoverboard at all times is a great idea, very handy, very functional. The hoverboard levels just aren't designed anywhere close to the level of sophistication that one sees in the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series. There aren't too many or them, and none of them are bad, but if I want to play Tony Hawk's Underground or SSX 3, I'll go play those games instead.    But there are hundreds of things to do in this game, not all of which I can recall. There are excellent chases with the Scouts, hunting levels in the forest, superb set-turret levels, an outstanding puzzle level using boxes over a pool of dark Eco, and the contest racing, well, these races are VERY fast, tense and satisfying. There is even a superb homage to FantaVision! So, though I do have my complaints, the vast levels of good stuff, of great gameplay, of challenging missions, definitely outweighs the less impressive stuff.    Graphics  Jak II is a superb, graphic treat. Whether you like the character design or not, the level of things on screen simultaneously, the high level of physics in the vehicles, the high level of detail on ALL the characters -- and the superb graphic sheen on both Jak and Daxter -- all show that Naughty Dog has a supreme command of the PS2.    Similar to Jak and Daxter, Jak II offers large landscapes, excellent vistas, seamless transitions from the inside of Haven City to the massive outer regions. Naughty Dog's designers have created marked difference in the levels. Some are dank, broken down areas using brown, beige and black as the primary colors, while outside the city, it's like an Eden of forests, pastures, wild flowers, butterflies, lakes, and rivers. The textures are never that stunning or complex, which is Naughty Dog's way, but the game is designed to show off a good amount of variety, lots of polygons, and a cartoon-style of character and background design. The vistas are gorgeous and impressive. Jak II is darker than any platformer the team has designed before, which translates into more urban environments, crowded houses and worn out streets. Characters with very cool design are Sig, Krew, and the race mechanic.    At this point, Naughty Dog has figured out how to add more and more stuff on screen while making nearly everything still look great. For instance, my favorite effects are the trails of firing weapons, or the heat blur and fiery burning fuel from the rear of a vehicle. And of course, then there is the animation. The characters offer a remarkably smooth set of animations at all times. I could go on and on about the animation, but if you have seen the first game, this just improves upon them.    Some things that I noticed more than I had expected: The LODs are very apparent. Meaning that objects coming into view show a noticeable change in texture detail and polygonal mass, and it's noticeable to the point of distraction. The characters are all very small. Were they this small before? Jak doesn't look that dark or evil. He looks like your regular angry, steampunk, half-elven kind of guy. There was some slowdown in larger areas, and there were even a few areas where the animation was botched. Oh yeah, one question -- why do the fruit boxes explode when you touch them? Are they filled with explosive grapes?     Oh, and for you tech heads, Jak II supports wide screen and progressive scan, so it's perfectly suited for your flat screen, progressive scan HDTV setup.    Sound  Attempting to rewrite the platform books with sound too, the naughty dogs of Crash Bandicoot fame have added millions of lines of dialog into Jak II. There is a healthy amount of conversation here, thankfully dolled out in small packets (unlike say, Knights of the Old Republic), and players get the chance to hear a vigorous amount of colorful characters using a surfeit of accents, speaking styles and the like. Daxter does talk too much, but that's his shtick. Jak talks just the right amount, and thankfully he's not acted with too much coolness or dudeness. He's cool, through and through.    The sound effects are impressive. The click of a vehicle's ignition, the boom of a the shotgun, and the roar of your racer all leave a positive aural impact.    Musically, the Tiki-style Casio music from the first game hasn't, sadly, been wiped away. And if gamers know the style from the first game, they'll no doubt be familiar with these tracks, all of which are original, though hardly the kind of songs you'd want to collect on a CD. However, the music dynamically changes during gameplay depending on the action. Sometimes it cuts out altogether. It suits the game well enough, but the music is best described as that stuff you hear in the background.    Lastly, offering gamers six languages simultaneously in addition to Dolby Pro Logic II, Naughty Dog does not deny those with a predilection for different tongues and hi-fi sound a roaring good time.I'll make my case this way: Jak II, whether you call it a platformer or not, is born from the tradition of platformers, and retains numerous elements of that world -- the control, the goofy characters, the kiddy playfulness, etc. So as an evolution of that genre, it does an outstanding job in catching, keeping, and generating my interest. When I'm at my most ADD, this game grabs my attention. When I'm totally mellow and not distractable at all, the variety of missions, and the level of the challenge (it's hard but not brutal, which is the perfect pitch for me) pull at my thumbs. If I look at the game as an action game, or as an adventure game, it's stunningly good, fat with great shooting levels, vehicle jacking, hovercraft missions, and some superb racing courses. Of course, the story is what drives this game forward, but it's the perfect blend of platforming elements and action-shooting that are so good, feel so right -- and with guns that feel so good -- that in the end, I don't give a damn what genre this game actually falls under. What is it? It's one of the very best games on PS2.", "date": "Oct 10, 2003"}
