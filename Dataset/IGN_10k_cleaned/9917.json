The iPod's click-wheel may not be appropriate for every genre, but a racing game? Of course. Just look at the back half of the controller: Wheel. This should have been an easy triple for Namco, delivering perhaps not a spectacular game, but at least a highly playable one that fit nicely between those Dean Martin songs. Unfortunately, somewhere between board room and the iTunes storefront, this game veered off-road and got stuck in the mud.   The chief problem is the control. Namco smartly tries to go casual with Pole Position Remix since the iPod isn't exactly heralded as the destination for the hardcore crowd. But the precision control via the wheel needed when ripping your formula car around a tight turn, track crowded with rival vehicles, just doesn't materialize. The wheel is just too sensitive and over-steering happens too often. The other problem is the lack of a meaningful brake. When you touch the wheel anywhere, your car accelerates. But as any racing fan knows, you need to use the brakes in conjunction with actual turning to survive a particularly harrowing corner. You can see the problem.   Unfortunately, there are a handful of other problems that keep Pole Position Remix from regaining any lost traction, none more fatal than the realization that Pole Position is somewhat of a shallow experience. Am I expecting Forza or Burnout here? Not at all, but the lack of finesse in Pole Position Remix is compounded by over two decades of solid, incremental improvements to racing games, none of which are tapped here. Also damaging to Pole Position Remix: The other cars. Granted, a collision of sorts at speeds approaching 180 mph would be deadly, but the tracks in this game are like minefields. One slight touch and your car explodes. The way these cars love to bunch together and seemingly drift right into you in the middle of the tricky turn -- already made perilous thanks to the controls -- borders on the unfair. You can try to weave and speed through these crowds by choosing to shift gears manually via the center button, but the issue is hardly alleviated.      I certainly appreciate that Namco did put some real effort into updating the game for the iPod. The refreshed visuals are only decent, but I really liked the addition of new tracks (included reverse and mirror modes) and themes that decorate both the vehicles and the horizon. The themes are modeled after Namco's hits, like Dig Dug, Tekken, and Pac-Man. There are future and retro themes, too. These extras are unlocked only after winning a set number of races. The billboards that pepper the roadside also bear not only signage from Namco classics, but also album artwork from your personal music collection. The signage may be a little grainy, but my Depeche Mode album covers were unmistakable as I wrestled with those frustrating corners.  Pole Position Remix spins out rather soon after it leaves the starting line. The visual refresh is neat (the album cover stuff is a particularly nice touch), but the control woes are extremely discouraging. I was really looking forward to this update, as I figured the click-wheel would be a great surrogate for an actual racing wheel. Maybe next time.", "date": "Jan 29, 2008"}
