Ladies and gentlemen, they are KISS!  ...And they couldn't be here tonight. Sorry, everybody.   Much has been made about the bizarre construct of GOD Games' Psycho Circus title, which uses KISS's rock gods and their music in a peripheral role for some unknown reason in an otherwise meandering, vaguely gothic shooter that owes more to Todd McFarlane's last five years as a comic artist and toy creator than KISS's 25 years as your parent's worst nightmare. But if it helps anybody who buys this game understand what the hell they're doing in a corridor crawler when they're expecting a rock explosion, then let it be said another hundred times -- KISS phoned in their role for this game. If Detroit Rock City  bummed you out with more STYX and ELO tracks than actual KISS, then Psycho Circus may just about push you to finally tear down those posters, because they missed this performance almost entirely.  But can it still be a good game without the title characters taking a lead role? It's possible. KISS Psycho Circus is certainly a pummeling FPS that offers enough carnage to score some frags on the competition. In the old days of Genesis platformers, screenfuls of enemies were four; Psycho Circus makes you wonder what the heck you were so scared of as a kid, throwing some two or three dozen enemies in a stage, all spitting fireballs and launching acid blobs your way. You will get nicely toasted in the process of playing this game.  In terms of the gameplay, Psycho Circus is exactly akin to those old platformers that flowed back in the day, now all done up in 3D. This is 3D Gauntlet, complete with Monster Spawners to destroy. This is a 3D beat-em-up, only with tons of ammo. This is a game where shooting things and making them blow up is the end-all, be-all of the gameplay. Occasional puzzles are placed in the path, but as long as you whack your way deep through the monster's lair, you will find the key or drainage valve needed to open a gate, and if you miss it, it's most often due to unnatural architecture or indistinct lighting hiding the way rather than the game outsmarting its player.  Graphically, TalonSoft has gotten the game running smooth and quickly off the Lithtech engine. Occasionally everything stutter-steps when a billion monsters are on your tail, and the hacked PC port means that the text is just about unreadable (something the Dreamcast seems doomed to in lazy situations -- thanks, WinCE!), but neither really interferes with the gameplay. The action still keeps up in hairy situations, and as for the bad text, the story is so moot that it never matters.  That's where things start to go wrong for Psycho Circus. This isn't just a rental game; it's an arcade game packed up for homes, completely disposable in every way. You can play two levels or twenty and still get whatever satisfaction it offers. Wading through all of the stages offers variety in terms of the weapons (each of the KISS Elders, the metaphysical representations of the KISS rockers, has a completely different set of guns to pick up), but the game should have just given players a choice right off the bat of choosing a route and character so they could see get their jollies off proper.   Psycho Circus suffers from being deathly generic. You'd at least think that the game, with the official endorsement of KISS, would be packed with KISS songs. Nope, instead you hear endless dirges and techno ambient tracks. The only time you hear a Frehley lick or a drum solo from the back is when you pass a jukebox or pass into some mythical KISS hall and hear it echoing down the passages. Then it's back to bad techno and MIDI guitars. I understand that players would get bored with just KISS songs over 20 hours of play, but why can't this game ever just rock, even once? Where's Beth when you need her most?  Everything else is equally generic. The textures are super-sharp, but look ripped right out of a Corel book of stock footage. Architecture is blocky and funky, sometimes appropriately adorned to hide the limited polygons, other times just stacked to the roof with boxes. Monsters are equally simple. Some are nice and round and detailed down to the last pot mark in that clown death mask, but then they move by sliding their limited animation back and forth. Tremor kept the focus on the gameplay with the port, so the Dreamcast game still looks and moves well, but they had precious little to work with, and long before graduating to the next Elder (almost ten stages later) where the environments and monsters finally change to the next generic set, this starts becoming painfully obvious.  Controlwise and otherwise, God Games has short shrifted the game by rushing it for Christmas. That means no mouse support or keyboard support for this shooter (and if you're ever been on the other end of network play with a Quake gunner trusting the Dreamcast controller for their frags, you know how laughable it is for shooters, especially without targeting assistance), though KISS's guns and other weapons are melee attacks for the most part, so you'll waste less ammo then you'd think. The biggest cop out though, is that they cut the Network Play. Hell, that's one of the only reasons to play this game, and Gathering of Developers knows it. But they couldn't get it down, or they didn't want to bother getting it down, so they just shipped it. There isn't even split-screen deathmatch. Bad move, Hans.  Six months ago, KISS might have had some relevance. Hell, three months ago, it would have been important. But now that Quake is here, KISS Psycho Circus is just another game on the shelves, and even though Quake doesn't quite serve that man-against-monsters melee Doom single-player gameplay that KISS does, it doesn't matter much in this case. It's still an enjoyable game, to be sure. It has plenty of moments to raise your blood pressure, and that's always a good thing. But it was supposed to be more, and you always feel that when chopping through level after monotonous corridor. It was supposed to be a KISS game, man.  --Marc Nix", "date": "Nov 4, 2000"}
