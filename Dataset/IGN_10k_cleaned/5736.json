The first time the Puyo Puyo design hit the US was in two flavors: Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine from Sega, and Kirby's Avalanche from Nintendo. Since then, the series has evolved on the systems in more confident, standalone, non-franchise branded versions on gaming platforms, including the strikingly decent (and cheap) THQ-published Puyo Pop on the Game Boy Advance.   The incredibly addictive game design continued to evolve on the consoles, where in 2004 Sonic Team pushed the newest update to the design --  Puyo Pop Fever -- on every current gaming platform. Sega of America really didn't show as much confidence in the game as Sega Japan did; only the GameCube version saw a stateside release of Puyo Pop Fever last year. Even the Nintendo DS version, a launch title for the system in Japan and featuring both Japanese and English versions in one cartridge, had been sitting in a holding pattern for North American gamers. Finally, after five months of sitting in limbo, Atlus has given the green light to the design for Nintendo DS gamers in the US, and as a result we get one of the best versions of the series ever created.   Puyo Pop Fever starts with the sound, addictive formula of rotating and stacking bean-like critters into a bin in order to make them disappear. By linking up four or more like colors at the bottom of the bin, these beans will vanish from play, with gravity taking over and causing the rest to settle and, hopefully, form more colored links. The strategy is in anticipating the stacks to create the best combos possible, since most of the gameplay modes in Puyo Pop Fever are in some sort of ~versus~ mode; by creating combos, you'll build up a stack of neutral bean ~rocks~ that will fall into the opponent's bin. If the opposition's got a stack ready to fall on your pile, you can combat the avalanche with combo links as well. It's a simple, pick-up-and-play formula that works, and works incredibly well on the handheld system.          The ~new~ elements of Puyo Pop Fever come in the form of more ~Tetris~ like shapes of four bean shapes to rotate. There's also a ~Fever~ mode that's activated when players pull off a series of combos which really give the player the upperhand against an opponent -- the ~Fever~ mode allows players to pull off bin-emptying combos incredibly easily by laying out simple sets of colors. It's a way to reward players for doing well in competition, though it really makes things incredibly unbalanced since only skilled players will get this mode activated. Luckily the DS version gives players the option to turn on and off the Fever elements, so the classic gameplay is completely retained in this update.    The Nintendo DS version doesn't really go above and beyond in its presentation, at least in the visual sense. On the GameCube (and other current generation systems), Puyo Pop Fever pushes a flashy 3D engine that's definitely energetic, but ultimately unnecessary. On the handheld, Sonic Team went with a much more modest Game Boy Advance-like engine, but unfortunately retained the over-the-top, obnoxious characterizations. It's a little too ~loud~ and ~happy~ for some, especially if you're looking for a simple ~low key~ puzzle challenge, so keep that in mind if screaming anime children get under your skin.   Sonic Team's Nintendo DS focus has been pushed more towards the system's wireless multiplayer aspect, and it's here that really makes the game a must-have. As many as eight players can join in a Puyo Pop Fever battle, with the Nintendo DS' screens displaying every player's bin. In two player mode, only the upper screen is used. Three and four player modes use both screens in standard sprite resolution. For five through eight players, the game utilizes half-sized sprites and crams the action onto both screens. The best part: only a single cartridge is needed to partake in this network. The game will send the file to any DS in range, really building on the whole ~community~ element of the Nintendo DS hardware.   The developers didn't shun the touch screen aspect of the Nintendo DS, though it's not entirely necessary since Puyo Pop's control really benefits from the precision that only digital buttons can offer. Still, the touch control is certainly playable and offers a unique way to experience the Puyo Pop design, using screen taps and directional drags with the stylus to recreate all the necessary controls in order to play the puzzle game. Of course, the touch screen does make navigating the menus a lot more intuitive.          The gameplay is what makes Puyo Pop Fever a brilliant design. It's a timeless design that works well in a handheld environment, and it's immensely addictive when you discover the mechanics that can wipe out a chunk of the filled bin in a single shot. The cartridge is jam packed full of elements, such as high score saving, statistics tracking, and unlockable extras, that will keep players coming back for more.The over-the-top, loud and energetic anime-style presentation, however, works against the design because the extraneous characterizations are, to be honest, absolutely frightening. There's not a single appealing, memorable character in the story mode, even when they're shouting their lines at the top of their squeak-filled lungs.  A lower key production would have benefited the game much more, because the story elements unnecessarily overpower the gameplay core.But even with that said, the gameplay still shines through, especially in multiplayer mode. Once you experience Puyo Pop Fever in an eight player network, you may never put your DS systems down.", "date": "May 4, 2005"}
