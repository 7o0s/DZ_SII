Saucy! The legendary hero of Mexico, made famous through various television and theatrical incarnations over the decades (including a deliciously ham-fisted turn by George Hamilton) is a noble hero and a good star for a mobile game -- especially since his all-black outfit really simplifies things for the designers of his in-game sprite.   The Legend of Zorro stretches across several levels, with the swashbaucklers taking on banditos, criminals, and all sorts of thuggery with his sword and whip. There are lots of opportunities for platforming -- Zorro's jumps seem unaffected by gravity -- and whip-swinging, but the majority of the game is rooted in slashing up bad men, whether on foot or on the back of Zorro's steed, Tornado.   As a simple action game, The Legend of Zorro of Zorro works. His move set is very small, just pressing on the attack button makes the itty-bitty hero poke away with his sword when next to bad guys. Pressing down brings up his block, which is contextual, depending on the enemy attack. Zorro also has a short supply of dynamite which is good for taking care of grouping of bad guys, especially when he lures them near exploding barrels.    When Zorro drops a bandito, coins are usually dispensed. Collect enough of these coins, and Zorro can upgrade his blade so it is more powerful. However, none of the enemies seemed to pose enough of a threat that you really need to worry about the upgrades. Even more so, many enemies can simply be avoided.   The Legend of Zorro isn't heavy on story -- nor does it need to be -- but the dialogue scenes are well-written. Portraits of Zorro and the other cast members are used when delivering the earnest dialogue. Zorro is often quick with a quip. You'll smile, because you imagine how Banderas would say it. (That dude knows how to sell goofy dialogue. Don't believe me? Rent ~The 13th Warrior.~ ~They think... they are bears!~)   The game is painted in the proper oranges and browns for this Mexi-Cali adventure. The animations aren't terribly detailed, but the game moved at a solid clip on a test Nokia 6620. There's a decent amount of audio, but nothing worth jacking up the volume for.  The Legend of Zorro is your basic movie tie-in game. It doesn't strive to be much more than an action game that stars Zorro -- and in that light, it delivers. But I think a lot of mobile gamers are starting to want more than cookie-cutter, even if it is a fairly well-constructed cookie. I just cannot recommend The Legend of Zorro, especially when Sony Picture Digital's Ratchet & Clank Going Mobile is just around the corner, too. If you're gonna flash some cash for Sony, that's the game to get.", "date": "Oct 22, 2005"}
