Now, some billions of years later, with a long and troubled history rooted back to Nintendo 64, the game has finally arrived.  So the big question is, has the wait been worth it? The answer is, quite simply, yes. Fox McCloud's latest journey comes as a rip off of Shigeru Miyamoto's Zelda offerings in just about every way possible and although Rare's execution isn't as brilliant as Nintendo's, it's still very well done. Star Fox Adventures is not without faults, but it's still a long, challenging adventure full of polish and complemented by some of the best graphics yet seen on GameCube.  If this is Rare's last GameCube title, the developer has left not with a whimper, but a relative bang. Our apologies to T.S. Eliot  The Facts  Play as Fox McCloud in his first adventure since Star Fox 64; also features classic team members Slippy, Peppy and Rob the Robot Explore a vast, gigantic 3D world filled with forestry, animals, puzzles and enemies Use a shape-shifting shaft to project blasts and change into different beings Walk, run, jump, roll, strafe and lock onto enemies with a targeting system Battle on land, in the water, or up in space using Fox's trusty Arwing Devise ways to best huge bosses hundreds of feet taller than Fox and friends Command a trusty sidekick triceratops named Prince Tricky, and meet up with a female ally named Krystal See breathtaking environments filled with lavish effects such as shimmering water, real-time lighting, shadows, intentional background blur and an advanced facial animation system Tons of in-game speech and well-composed musical scores  Runs in progressive scan Dolby Pro Logic II support Requires 3 memory blocks for saves   Gameplay Once upon a time Rare was working on a project known simply as Dinosaur Planet. It featured all original characters and took place in a world filled with the prehistoric beasts. Then Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto stepped in and that game changed to Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet. Eventually 'Dinosaur Planet' was dropped altogether from the title and gamers were left with the end product, what is essentially still the same game except now with the Star Fox team.   There's a story here and it involves aligning scattered pieces of Dinosaur Planet back together so that the world can return to normal. There's an evil tyrant, a heroine in distress, both land adventure and space flight missions, and much, much, more. But fans expecting a true Star Fox experience akin to the older games are in for a disappointment. The Star Fox license has been utilized sparingly -- to the point, in fact, where it feels totally out of place within the confines of this game universe. Fox is clearly only on this world at Nintendo's request, not because he belongs. The character dabbles not in technology, but rather in magic; a staff left behind by Krystal, who has been imprisoned, becomes Fox's weapon of choice. It can do everything from shoot ice to fire bursts, cause mini-quakes, activate switches and beat on enemies. He acquires magical items and useful ancient artifacts, from blow horns to bars of gold and much more. His blaster, though, is not used and the flight missions seem tacked on to the real game, which is definitely disappointing.   Still, regardless of whether or not Fox and friends feel at home on Dinosaur Planet, the game is a lot of fun, very engaging, long and ultimately satisfying. Rare has adopted the Zelda control scheme nearly verbatim so that Fox is manipulated and functions exactly as Link would with a modification here and there for good measure. Fox moves identically, can roll, pull out his staff and fight, while special functions (shooting fire, transforming into an enemy disguise) can be mapped handily to the Y button for quick access. McCloud, like Link, cannot be made to jump manually -- it's automatic, and it still works triumphantly. The biggest difference in the setup is that in Zelda the Z-trigger was used to lock-on and target enemies while in SFA it's done automatically. This is largely a beneficial addition. The setup, as a whole, is one of the best in a third-person adventure game, just as it was for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.  Star Fox Adventures is an epic undertaking -- a perfect companion to the Zelda series. Fox sets down in ThornTail Hollow, a green-filled, peaceful hub world with various dinosaurs grazing about. It's not nearly as large or impressive as Hyrule Field was when gamers first saw it on N64, but it's ambitious nonetheless. The hub leads out most of the other areas Fox can travel to, which range from beach locales to icy worlds, volcanic points and crater-filled, moon-like terrains. There are additionally several locations that the character can only reach by Arwing -- scattered chunks of Dinosaur Planet adrift in space. The game moves in and around them.  Rare has done a lot right here. It has successfully created a vast world sewed together by a main quest and also connected by various sub goals. Fox must not only retrieve four Force Point Seals, but six Krazoa Spirits (ghostly entities that possess the power to free early-captured Krystal from her prison), too. He can only complete these objectives if he has first rescued Prince Tricky, a sidekick character that is more or less an annoying baby dinosaur. He must grow Tricky's powers and simultaneously level up the functions of his staff, both of which play an integral part. He must find and buy items that are useful in advancing, and much more. There is enough in place to keep gamers busy -- realistically -- for 20 hours or more, which is very impressive. We'd be surprised if anybody managed to beat the game much quicker the first time through. Some less rushed gamers are likely to spend double that progressing through the adventure. There are more than a couple surprises waiting, too, including an ultra-slick finale, upping the incentive to keep playing considerably.  The levels in the game are downright beautiful  The puzzle challenges, some of the biggest appeals in these types of titles, come as something of a mixed bag. There are some that are cleverly executed with thoughtful regard for players. These will definitely remind adventurers of the puzzles in the Zelda series, and there is a tangible sense of satisfaction after completing them. There are plenty, too. One of our favorites involves figuring out a way to get an explosive barrel into a golden treasure room, through a dark corridor and next to a cracked wall. It's a lot trickier than it sounds and it's equally rewarding. On the other hand, there are some sloppily designed challenges too. Worse, there is often not a clear sense of what needs to be done in some puzzles. For instance, there are occasional levers or light switches that must be activated in levels and having done that there is no indication that anything's been completed and so players are left guessing what to do or where to go next. In Zelda, having completed a sub-puzzle, a door opens, or a sound chimes, or the camera points players in the right direction. Luckily the good far outweigh the bad.      The final addition, the one bit that slightly separates this title from Zelda in terms of raw gameplay features, is that of Prince Tricky. The sidekick character accompanies Fox through the majority of the game and players can control him with the camera stick (via a series of commands). The character himself is stupid, but his contributions to the quest are invaluable and there is quite a lot of entertainment to be gained once his abilities are fully harnessed. There is a certain sense of play multitasking that comes with the sidekick, which is quite an accomplishment. Gamers can make the dinosaur lackey do everything from breathe fire on objects (burning or melting them), stand on weight plates to trigger doors, dig up secrets, retrieve objects and more, and all of these commands can be executed while Fox fights with enemies, if so desired. It's really well done and we hope that Nintendo will perhaps borrow this element from Rare's offering, just as Rare has used aspects of Nintendo games so many times before.  In the end, Star Fox Adventures delivers gamers with a fun, long quest with inspiration from the Zelda franchise at every turn. It's our opinion that Link's exploits still beat out Fox's in every gameplay related category, but that doesn't make this -- Rare's final GameCube offering -- any less sweet.  Graphics Rare's Xbox alignment will be felt a little deeper by Nintendo fans after they sink their teeth into Star Fox Adventures because it is easily one of the prettiest, most technically advanced GameCube titles yet.   First, the developer has taken what is essentially a fox in clothing and spruced up the character considerably, utilizing shading techniques to render individual fur, employing a facial animation system that is far beyond anything competitors are doing, and texturing the hero with some of the crispest, most detailed skins around. There is some debate about whether or not Fox McCloud is, quite simply, a comically poor character, but there should be none regarding Rare's execution of the model. Indeed, compared to the Fox seen in Super Smash Bros. Melee, for instance, players would need a scroll to list the improvements Rare has made in Star Fox Adventures. All of the other characters in the game, allies of enemies, have been given equally fine constructions, all of them brought to life with vivid, fluid animation, geometrical additions, and much more.  Rare's visual expertise does not stop with character building though. The worlds, too, are filled with big and little touches that help set Star Fox Adventures apart from the pack. The hub station in the game features a flowing stream completed with reflections refraction, grass that jets out from patches of dirt, dirty boulders, bricked walls, and giant, hulking dinosaurs that wag their tails happily as they stand about. The levels the hub connects to are more impressive still -- some are gargantuan things filled with water lakes; others snowy vistas with white particles misting about; more take place in lava-filled lands with molten rock that radiates a well realized heat distortion effect. The developer's texture work continues to rule supreme, as vibrant, colorful tiles spread across the ground and wall and blend seamlessly into one another. The worlds Fox visits are vastly different in appearance -- and are absolutely beautiful.  Surprisingly, Rare has even gained control of the framerate, for the most part, in Star Fox Adventures. The game runs smooth the majority of the time, with drops in fluidity restrained largely to the hub world and select spots in some of the connected locations. For instance, up close shots of Fox's fur cause it and so do areas where the software house has attempted tuffs of shaded grass. There is some odd data streaming in spots, which temporarily pauses the action and then continues, but it's barely a complaint as it is an observation. Likewise, there are they very sparse blurred textures, perhaps remnants of the long lost Nintendo 64 version, but these too are few and far between.  Fox meets all sorts of characters on his adventure.  Also, this game not only runs in progressive scan, but also supports 16x9 widescreen mode too. We can tell you from experience that running Star Fox Adventures in both is something close to videophile nirvana.  Sound The audio side Star Fox Adventures is outstanding. The game serves up a delicious blend of well-composed tracks and lots of voice acting. The music isn't orchestrated, but it still sounds great and it's likely to leave players humming songs long after they've turned the game off. Meanwhile, the voice acting -- way over the top, for sure -- is equally enjoyable, nicely acted, and believable. Well, as believable as a talking dinosaur with a British accent can be. Again, Rare has taken advantage of its options so that everything runs in Dolby Pro Logic II, which is lovely on the ears.Star Fox Adventures arrives as a truly excellent 3D action-adventure for GameCube owners.  It's a clear Zelda rip, and not quite as good, but that's okay in my book as Rare has still done a pretty good job of it. There's lots of exploration to be had, character building elements, fun puzzles and not so fun puzzles, and some amazingly beautiful worlds to see and visit. Rare's technology is practically unparalleled. Whether or not this needed to be a Star Fox game is debatable. The license seems to have been applied at the last hour and though there are a few interesting additions in this regard, the majority of the game deals with prehistoric happenings and magic. The flight missions come as more of an afterthought than anything else.This is also one of the longest, more difficult games available for Nintendo's console, which is something of a relief for me and I'm sure for countless other players looking for something deeper than usual.Highly recommended.", "date": "Sep 23, 2002"}
