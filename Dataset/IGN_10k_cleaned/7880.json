This time around the dog detective and his rabbity sidekick are being called in to rescue the audience members being held hostage by the overly generous talk show host. Along the way, the deranged duo will explore a massive television station, star in a few shows and meet a wide cast of colorful (literally, in one case) and chaotic characters.    For the most part, our comments about the quality of the previous episode stand with regard to the sequel. The dialogue is genuinely witty and the game is full of hidden gems and references that are well worth seeking out. Even assuming you seek out all the little gags sprinkled here and there, this episode's a bit shorter than the last one; we finished it in just under three hours. Fortunately, the story is a little more compact this time around and seems to be building towards an arc for the entire series. The TV station itself is a much larger location than any we saw in the previous installment giving the whole experience a sense of freedom as well as focus.   Whereas the puzzles of the first episode presented little challenge, those in the second episode are virtually challenge free. There's nothing even approaching the complexity of the trap you had to lay for Whizzer in the last game. This time around your brain will barely break a sweat trying to figure out how to hide a cow, where to get a picture of an alien, or how to bake a cake. The few multi-part puzzles are generally solved during the course of the story, so you won't need to backtrack if you come up against a roadblock; just go explore the rest of the areas and finish your other tasks and you're sure to find a way around your current obstacles.  Again, as with the first game, we're not asking the designers to include complicated, 7th Guest-style logic puzzles here. We're merely suggesting that the game would be more rewarding if it didn't feel like it played itself. To be fair, you'll have to make a few intuitive leaps here and there to accomplish your objectives but, for the most part, the puzzles in Situation: Comedy require little more than a bit of patience and some old fashioned trial-and-error.  Sam & Max are still wonderfully cynical and witty, turning their trademark wit on all manner of subjects. From the claim that a plan is ~shadier than a fat man's ankles~ to the unobtrusive placement of Prune Nuts on the shelf at the local inconvenience store, Situation: Comedy is chock full of genuine laughs.   We still don't think this new Sam & Max approaches the zany, sharp comedy of the original. The game chooses to satirize pop culture standards like American Idol and Oprah Winfrey but doesn't really do anything we haven't already seen a dozen other times. It's not that the gags aren't funny but they seem to be playing it a bit too safe. In one instance you'll be asked to get a picture of an alien involved in a threesome but when the time comes to take the picture, you'll basically just have to snap a pic of three folks standing next to each other. In this way the game seems to flirt with potentially hilarious and absurd situations but then takes a step back and does something a little more conservative.  For instance, the skinbodies (who are like skinheads but, you know, all over) seem to carry the potential for loads of wacky humor but they're barely used at all. Instead we get a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire parody. Yawn. Maybe next they'll make fun of hippies.      Players of the first episode will be disappointed to see that so many of the gags from the first game have been recycled here. The office, inconvenience store and Sybil's place use pretty much the same objects and sight gags as before and Sam and Max even make the same comments. On the plus side, there are plenty of new interactions to be had with Bosco and Sybil. Bosco's new identity is absolutely inspired and came across as one of the funniest aspects of this episode. By comparison Sybil and the Soda Poppers felt a bit flat.  Happily, there are plenty of new characters to laugh at here. The TV host Myra Stump makes a much better villain than Brady Culture because she seems to a bit more focused. Sure, it's a fairly obvious send up of certain female talk show hosts but her motivation, actions and dialogue are undeniably hilarious. The soft-spoken Hugh Bliss is an even more brilliant caricature of self-help gurus than Brady Culture ever was but he, like the skinbodies, is gone too soon.   Finally, there's a chicken actor named Philo Pennyworth who we'd love to see become a regular in the series. He's funny enough when he arrives in his Mr. Furley-inspired persona but when the cameras stop rolling and you find out what he's really all about, you'll love the character even more.  The camera problems of the previous game seem to have been smoothed out but there are still a few small production issues here. For one thing, the subtitles still break in mid-sentence which mildly disrupts some of the humorous dialogue. Inventory management and the overall interface are still wonderfully intuitive and never get in the way of the visuals.  The graphics and sound haven't changed since the previous review. The visuals are still a wonderful polygonal realization of a highly stylized, 2D cartoon world and the environments are full of all kinds of hilarious sight gags. The design of the new characters and locations is fantastic. The new voice actors handle their parts very well, particularly Hugh Bliss and Philo Pennyworth. As always, the jazz soundtrack adds loads of atmosphere and attitude to the game.   Situation: Comedy advances the story but it doesn't exactly move the series forward in terms of gameplay or humor. The puzzles are all much too easy and don't really tax the gray matter too much. Likewise, the jokes are too safe to really do justice to the franchise. After our last review, we were told that the game makers hoped to improve on both areas of the game but we didn't really see it here. That said, Sam & Max is still enjoyable for its cynical wit and generally inventive situations. Just realize that you'll be playing it more for the enjoyment of the manic atmosphere than for the challenge it provides. Two or three hours of entertainment might not sound like much, but for fans of dog and rabbit humor, it's a pretty good bargain for the price.", "date": "Jan 3, 2007"}
