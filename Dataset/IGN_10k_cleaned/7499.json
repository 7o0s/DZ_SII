Colors are swirling in front of my face and I just saw some huge green thing with a long nose run in front of me.  No, I'm not hallucinating from lack of rest, I'm just up at 4am playing EverQuest, one of the most addictive games I've played in years.  Sony had a lot to prove with EverQuest and, for the most part, they've made the other online RPGs perk up and take notice of the new kid on the block.  And while EverQuest isn't perfect by any means, it is the most immersive and most addictive online RPG to date.     The Lay Of The Land  Gameplay in EverQuest takes place in Norrath, a world split into three major continents: the small island of Odus, the main continent of Antonica, and the medium-sized island of Faydwer.  Nestled in the northern portion of Odus is the town of Erudin, home to the Erudites, a race of High Men who, for the most part, value arcane enlightenment over martial knowledge. Antonica is the largest of the three continents and is also home to the most urban settlements.  Seven cities are spread throughout its reaches and seven different races claim Antonica as their cultural birthplace.  There's Freeport and Qeynos (two cities consisting mainly of Humans and Half-Elves), Oggok (home of the Ogres), Grobb (the Troll capital), Neriak (city of the Dark Elves), Rivervale (where Halflings reside), and Halas (the frozen Barbarian hometown).  Faydwer is also a multi-cultural land with four cities (Kaladim, Ak'Anon, Kelethin, and Felwithe)  and five indigenous races. Kaladim is the underground Dwarven city located in the ButcherBlock mountains, Ak'Anon is the Gnomish settlement, and Kelethin and Felwithe are home to the Wood Elves and High Elves, respectively. Like Freeport and Qeynos, you'll find a number of Half-Elves living in the Elvish cities in Faydwer.  Each of these islands are connected by ocean-going vessels and you are free to travel between the three provided you can make your way to the port towns of Erudin, Qeynos, Freeport, or the port just outside of Kaladim.  There are also several smaller island scattered along each route, many containing some of the stranger beasts of Norrath.  Because of its immense size, fully exploring Norrath would literally take you days ... and that's if you didn't stop to fight any creatures or talk to any NPCs.  The entire world of Norrath comprises about seventy enormous sections which load into memory after you cross zonal boundaries. I would estimate that I've set foot in approximately forty of the different regions throughout the beta and into the final, I I've come nowhere close to thoroughly exploring every territory.  The gameworld is extensive and there is certainly plenty to keep you busy in Norrath.      What Do You Want To Be When You Grow Up?  Character creation in EverQuest will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a RPG.  You're presented with a screen where you pick one of the twelve different races and your respective profession from a list of fourteen (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadowknight, Shaman, Warrior, or Wizard).  Each race is limited to which professions they may choose, so you won't be able to play an Ogre Monk for instance.  Depending on your race, you'll be given a number of ability points to distribute among your six main statistics (strength, stamina, agility, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence, and charisma).  Then all that's left to do is name you character, pick your sex, and decide which deity you wish to follow.  Hit the 'Enter World' button and, *poof*, you'll begin your adventures in one of the aforementioned cities.   Takin' It Out For A Test Drive  The first thing you'll discover when you hop into the game for the first time is that it's going to take a bit of time and practice to effectively control your character.  You're presented with an interface screen that is packed with buttons surrounding your main viewing window.  Although the interface may be daunting in the beginning, it is rich with information and the control system is actually quite fluid once you get it down, especially if you use a mouse/keyboard combination for exploring the vast reaches of Norrath.  The left hand side of the interface is reserved for character information and the right hand side is where most of your action buttons lie.  You have a hotkey pad in the lower left corner where you can store a total of thirty-six (six pages of six) of your most used action buttons.  From the main screen you'll also have instant access to eight of your favorite spells.  Although a bit busy, the interface puts a lot of control at your fingertips and keeps the page flipping down to a minimum.   While you can play EverQuest as a simple hack-'n'-slash adventure, the development team has added the little extras needed to pull players out of the typical RPG mold.  Real-time party adventuring is encouraged and, if you actually put the effort into gathering a good balanced party of adventurers consisting of a few warrior types, a few mana throwers, and a couple of healers, then you'll be able to take part in more exciting and challenging battles.  The designers have also included a number of quests that you can undertake for those of you who tire of continually hunting monsters.  And you may even stumble across dynamic quests offered by real-life GMs if you happen to be in the right place at the right time.   The dev team has also done quite an impressive job with handling the player-killing syndrome that frustrates many online RPG players.  Instead of pitting you against other PCS at the start of the game, Verant puts the PK option in your hands.  If you want to have the option of killing other PCS, then all you have to do is give a PK scroll to the Priest of Discord and you become a PKer.  Admittedly the percentage of PKers on the main servers is relatively low, so gamers looking for the challenge of taking on live opponents may become frustrated looking for them.  But Verant has set aside an entire server entirely for player vs. player, so if you really want to PK then all you have to do is create a character on that server.    What're You Lookin' At, Bub?  Visually EverQuest is a beautiful experience.  The graphic designers have done a fantastic job of modeling a variety of different natural environments such as swamps, forests, plains, and deserts and in giving each of the cities it own unique feel and architecture.  The gameworld is rendered entirely in 3D and the game supports D3D and Glide compatible 3D cards. The graphics are a bit jagged as compared to some of the top 3D games, but overall the visual quality of EverQuest is excellent and you'll really feel like you're traversing through a fantasy terrain while exploring Norrath.  You can view the action from a variety of different views and you have a lot of control of the camera position if you wish to use a third person perspective. To make for a more realistic gameworld, the designers have added day/night cycles and weather effects such as rain and snow.  The spell effects are particularly impressive and the lighting and particle effects associated with each will mesmerize you. Nothing was spared in making the visual presentation of this game as entertaining as any other portion of it.   As good as the world looks, I do wish there was more PC variety.  You can only pick from a limited number of face types and you can't vary the body types whatsoever, so characters of the same race look very similar from afar. This is especially confusing if you're following, say, a High Elf and another High Elf crosses your path.  You may begin following the other character because, from behind, like races look identical.  Of course, you can somewhat customize your character's appearance with certain items.  Swords, axes, and staffs will appear in your hand when you equip them and if you don armor your character will actually be wearing that armor type.   Lend me Your Ears, Mine Are At The Cleaners  One of the most noticeable aspects that was missing in the beta of EverQuest was sound effects.  When the aural experience really kicked off in phase 4, boy was it an entirely different game ... and things have only gotten better in the final.  The dynamic background music changes with the situation or the location and the environmental sound effects really add to the immersiveness of the game.  Get close to a babbling brook and you'll hear flowing water, stand in a valley and you'll hear wind whooshing past your ears.  It's the little touches, like the thunder that accompanies rain storms, that really make you feel like you're in a real rather than a virtual world.   Into Every Eden Must Fall A Little Rain  As good as it is, EverQuest has had its share of problems.  The first weekend it was up was a lot like Eden ... it was a nice place, but everybody kept getting kicked out. One of the major routers for UUnet, one of Verant's ISPs, went kaput, stressing other ISPs and causing horrible packet loss and connection problems during the first week of EverQuest's release.  But I have to hand it to Verant, they are doing a decent job of ameliorating these problems and handling the complaints of their early customers.  They've replaced the faulty equipment and they are even extending the free play period from a month to a month and a half for those customers who signed up before March 24th.  Since the first week things have gotten much better and even with all of the problems its still more playable than Ultima Online.  This week, as in the beta, the game has rarely suffered from major lag issues now, even on a 28.8k modem.  We've also been hearing some people complaining that there is a lack of true role-playing in EverQuest and that it just seems like a huge graphical chat room.  Well, this really isn't something you can fault Verant for.  The game engine is set-up for it, but players have to utilize it. I have seen a lot more people acting out their roles on the PvP server so, if this is something that interests you, then maybe you should look into playing there.     Doeseth It Deserveth My Bucketh?  Even with all of its problems, EverQuest is still a lot of fun and its extremely addictive.  Just be prepared to be patient with EverQuest in its infancy because you will invariably get frustrated, fed-up and pissed-off at the game ... but I can guarantee that you'll be back on the server within two days going at it again.  Should you rush out and get a copy?  Well it all depends on if you have the fortitude to ride out the bumpy beginnings.  Simply put, EverQuest is the best online RPG on the market, but it suffers the same problems inherent in all online games.  Is it worth $9.89 a month to play?  I believe so, as long as Sony and Verant continue to support the EverQuest project with server and network upgrades.   Could it be better?  Of course it could ... and I'm certain it will become better and better with time. All said, EverQuest is a game that is constantly evolving, and we're looking forward to seeing how the game progresses into the next millennium.  And, since we'll be playing this one far into the future, we'll be able to keep you updated on Verant's progress in the massive multiplayer online arena.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 27, 1999"}
