But that would have been my USA-centric mind causing me to ignore the fact that soccer is the world's most popular sport and not know that EA Sports' FIFA series has sold more copies worldwide than any other of its sports games.   Even though it keeps on selling well and will likely to continue selling well, the series has often been met with some criticisms amongst certain very vocal groups of diehard soccer fans. According to these people, the FIFA series was too much of an arcade game and didn't give users a faithful representation of the sport of soccer. Someone at the company must have been paying attention, because FIFA Soccer 2002 is the biggest evolution that we've yet seen in the series and most of the changes seemed geared towards pleasing those begging for a more realistic soccer simulation.  Gameplay The area where you'll see the largest change in terms of way the game is played is with the passing game. No longer are passes completely automatic. Instead of simply going directly towards the player you're trying to pass the ball to and always being perfect, the passing system in FIFA 2002 is a little more flexible. There is now a power meter that lets the player greatly control the strength of the pass or lob, but the ball is now passed exactly in the direction that the directional stick is being pressed and not straight to the player in that direction.   This simple little change has really changed the way that the game is played and allows for a great deal more strategy in the way that you play the game. Since you now pass the ball to a space and not directly to players, the art of making a good through pass comes into play and the passing game works much more like it does in real life soccer.   There's also a new way to send guys on through runs by using the analog stick to face the player in the direction that the run should be made and by pressing the L1button and that combined with the ability to more easily perform one-twos with other teammates by flicking the right analog stick in the direction of the other player, makes for a very fluid and realistic passing game.  The new passing system has also made for a more challenging game because it's completely eliminated the biggest money play of last year's game -- running down the sideline, lobbing it to the center, and having a guy do a header or bicycle kick to knock it in for an easy goal. Because passing requires more precision and is no longer a pinpoint process, trying to do that same technique in this year's game is a much more difficult task.  Shooting is also a little more complex, as it makes use of both a power meter to control the strength of the shot and the Dual Shock 2's pressure sensitive buttons to control the height. Those used to the almost automatic shots of previous FIFA games might find this a bit of a hassle at first, as they'll likely see a lot of bad shots in the early going, but it doesn't take that much time to learn to use the added control effectively and after some time, they'll learn to appreciate the additional depth.   The one foreseeable problem with both the passing and shooting that the soccer simulation fans will not like is that the ball physics still seem a little too scripted and the ball still has the tendency to magnetize itself to the player's feet. Even with the ability to change the power and height, most of the shots on goal and passes look the same and you never get the feeling that a real ball is being kicked around. It might seem like a non-issue to some, but what this does is limit the types of goals you're likely to see and limits the overall gameplay depth in the game since you never get the feeling that you can shoot from anywhere.   The game is still pretty fun to play, but you're going to have to accept it as an arcade-styled game to enjoy it. If you can do that, you're going to get a lot of fun out of this game. It's much more challenging than it was last year and not just because of the less precise passing system. The AI puts up more of a fight and unless you're playing the game on the lowest difficulty setting, the special moves, which were often unstoppable in the past, no longer work at such a high frequency.  You'll still be able to get buy some players with a special move, but your success rate will be lower in general and it'll be harder to get by someone who has a higher rating than you. In order to succeed on the higher difficulty settings, you're going to need to learn to efficiently pass the ball, make use of one-twos and through passes, and use your head some.    Feature Set If you're a fan of the way the game plays, you'll be pleased to know that this title is crammed with enough features to keep yourself busy for months. It's easily one of the deepest sports games around as far as feature sets is concerned and it contains a whopping 16 leagues, 500-plus teams and a total of 10 tournaments. The chances are pretty good that you won't ever see everything that the game has to offer.   FIFA also makes use of a reward system that lets you unlock new tournaments and even get some player cards. But, don't expect something as elaborate as what's in EA's football and hockey games because it's not. The cards are just a face and there's not a big checklist of in-game things to do, but rather a list of the game's tournaments that you must beat.   One of the coolest play modes is the ability to enter a World Cup qualification tournament. This allows you to take any of the teams in the AFC, CONCACAF, UEFA, or CONMEBOL and go through a series of matches that determine who gets to participate in the upcoming 2002 World Cup in Korea in Japan. And even though we don't see any mention of it in the manual, we're pretty sure that you'll be able to use your saved game at the end of each tournament to determine the teams that are used in EA Sports' upcoming FIFA World Cup 2002 that should be released early next year.   In addition to all the tournaments that you can participate in and leagues that you can play through a season of, there's also a lot of great roster management and creation features. All of the game's rosters can be manipulated, teams can be edited (uniforms, stadiums, etc.), current players can be tweaked and new players can be created. The player creation feature is also very deep and one of the best you'll see in any sports game from EA.   Graphics FIFA 2002 is a great looking soccer game. The transition animation is a bit lacking making for some jerky animation between movements, but just about everything else is really good. The animated moves are very fluid and lifelike, the grass looks great, the lighting on the field is excellent, and the crowds are some of the best you're going to see in a sports game. There might be some slowdown at times, but it never proves to be a problem and only happens in rare situations.   The player models are fairly detailed and there are quite a few new accessories, faces and hairstyles to be seen. I guess the only problems are that there doesn't seem to be a big difference in player sizes and a lot of the faces are butt ugly -- but that might be because soccer players are just ugly freaks, though I'm guessing that the game just has some freaky faces.  Sound The game's audio is also very good. The commentary work, which is handled by John Motson, who does the play-by-play and Andy Gray, who handles the color work, is fairly well done. It sounds as if you're watching a real soccer match and the two men provide a lot of insightful commentary and they give the impression that they're chatting together. The things they say are pretty in tune with what's going on in the current match and they'll actually comment about specific stuff in the game, such as whether or not the shot was the player's first or if he had missed a few earlier. Like I said earlier, it really gives you the impression that you're listening to the commentary of a real soccer match.  The music is going to be a love or hate thing, but that's probably always the case with licensed music. It's turned off by default for gameplay, so it's not much of an issue anyway. There are a ton of music tracks in the game, though, so it's worth mentioning. If you're musical tastes are for Euro-sounding tunes, you might end up turning the in-game music on.  The last thing we'll talk about is crowd noise. The crowds sound very realistic, but there doesn't really seem to be enough variance with it from stadium to stadium and during the game. The will do some cool things like chant the home team's name in key situations, but I honestly wish it could've been a bit more dynamic.Instead of just taking this space to sum up and finish off the review like is normally done, I'll instead use it to explain some things. Let's start with why this game is getting an 8.5 when I claim that it's greatly improved over last year's FIFA 2001 Major League Soccer, which received a 9.0 out of 10. We simply scored the game too high. Typically when a game leans heavier towards the arcade side of things, it has great instant appeal and not a lot of long-term depth in gameplay because of its simplicity. FIFA 2001 suffered from this and probably should've received a mid to high 7 or a low 8 at the highest. Now lets move onto the whole issue of FIFA versus Konami's ISS Pro Evolution series. Those already in the FIFA camp will probably love this game and might even think I scored it too low. It's still more of an arcade game than a soccer simulation and while the new passing takes some getting used to, the fact that there's more skill required to play the game will likely please the game's current fans. The deeper gameplay will also make it much easier to take advantage of the feature depth that the series has always offered. For those of you that haven't liked FIFA, think that it's overrated and have preferred Konami's ISS Pro Evolution series, you'll likely appreciate the changes in the game, but will ultimately find that its gameplay lacks the depth of the PE series and doesn't offer as realistic of a simulation of the sport that you love so much. Electronic Arts should be commended for its efforts, though, as the change from FIFA 2002 to FIFA 2002 is pretty dramatic and the company managed to do it without doing anything that would alienate current fans of its game. It still has some ways to go before it replaces Konami's series in the hearts and minds of many soccer diehards, but as is FIFA Soccer 2002 is a splendid soccer title.", "date": "Nov 3, 2001"}
