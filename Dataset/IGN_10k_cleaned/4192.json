Sure, they might not be the Ivy League equivalent of Cincinnati or Syracuse, but at least their players go to class, scored more than 1200 on their SATs, and, God forbid, might actually graduate some day.  But that's where you come in. You're an ambitious coach looking for a shot at your ~one moment in time~. You know you can coach, you know you can put together a winning squad, but those damn athletic directors at Duke won't return your phone calls (or in this case, e-mails). In ESPN College Hoops, you're given the opportunity to take a basketball program in shambles like Dartmouth and turn them into a national power. You're in charge of everything from recruiting high school superstars to hiring assistant coaches to setting up a winning program that will bring the pride, passion, and excitement of college basketball back to the Big Green.  And who knows, with enough wins, your players might even start skipping class just like a real-deal basketball powerhouse.  But that is where ESPN College Hoops earns its keep, as its Legacy mode is so deep that the longer you play it, the more you want to keep playing in hopes of one day bringing your club to the big dance.  Either that, or turn your back on the school that gave you your start and sign on to coach a real school where the prestige alone will score you the top recruits in the country. Ah, an ethics lesson in a college basketball game. How ironic.  Hoosier Daddy  If you played College Hoops 2K3 last year, you'll be impressed by the number of additions made to the series. The game now sports 326 teams, has more than double the amount of unique arenas, has added cut scenes that include mascots, cheerleaders, and student sections cheering, fighting, and spilling frosty beverages on each other, and has even gone the extra step in getting all of the real school chants for the major teams in the game. You can create your own school, design your own arena, and pretty much nail the exact details of your new center for higher education, including the mascot and cheerleader uniforms.  But that's not even the half of it.  Player control has been enhanced to include the intuitive IsoMotion controls made famous in ESPN NBA Basketball. The offensive moves have been switched over to the right analog stick, though, and as you get used to the change, you realize the change is for the better as it's simpler to execute your jukes. On defense, the right analog stick is now used to swipe at the ball and go for the steal. You are able to swipe high, low, or toward the mid-section of ball handlers, and while this offers you more of a chance to be rewarded with a steal, it also carries with it great risk, as the more you swipe, the more of a chance you have to commit a foul, and unlike the NBA, you only have five fouls before your player rides the pine.    The game also features an all new mode entitled Slam Session that basically takes all of the elements you love from the NBA Slam Dunk contest and brings them to the college scene. It works similar to the gymnastics portion of Track & Field, where the player picks a move, then must hit the correct sequence of buttons that correspond to the move as the dunker heads toward the hoop. There's a circle on the hardwood that designates your jump off point, and when you successfully hit the buttons in time, you then hit the button to jump from that circle to watch as your player leaps into the air for a Statue of Liberty, gorilla, 360, or whatever other slam you are attempting. The more difficult the slam, the longer and more complicated the button sequence. To help gamers out, you can move your baller back a few steps to give you more time to hit the buttons, but this will in affect cause the judges to give you a slightly lower score. Like First-Person football, the NHL mini-games, and 24/7 mode, Slam Session is another game within the game that ends up zapping entirely too much of your free time as you try to perfect the between the legs jam. To top it off, you can play Slam Session online in a dunk contest against the best in the country and prove once and for all if you've got the most hops, or at least the quickest fingers.  And while Slam Session is a lot of fun, it's ESPN's Legacy mode that's the biggest winner in the game. The now multiplayer Legacy mode enables you to take a school in the b-ball gutter and try to turn its trash into treasure. You start out by hiring two assistants to help you scout, recruit, and devise your game plan. The better the assistant, the better info you receive about opponents, the better the high schoolers who want to commit to your program, and the more your players will improve in their areas of expertise. The problem you have is that since your team stinks, you start out with a couple of scrub coaches as well. But that's the trick, you deal with the situation and improve your circumstance by transforming your school into a winning organization. At first, your goal might be to win 50% of your games. The more you win, the better the players you'll get to come to your school. The better the players, the more you'll win. Get your squad to the Tournament and watch as job offers from around the country come pouring in. Not that you have to wait for them to come to you, as you can actually e-mail athletic directors from around the country to apply for head coaching jobs. Not that someone from North Carolina is going to beat your doors down after one break-even season, but it's always nice to keep your options open.       As your wins start to amass, though, you will have some tough decisions to make. You can fire the old assistants who've been loyal to you for new coaches with better stats. You can leave your school for one with more marquee of a basketball program, but with the new job comes new headaches as your expectations will be raised to the point where if you don't reach the tournament, you're liable to get fired. Not to mention the fact that just as you're building your team around your hotshot frosh point guard, he decides to leave school early and enter the NBA draft (at least you can import him into ESPN NBA Basketball). You might even have one of your assistants quit because he thinks it's too stressful to coach at a big-time program. From managing the year-round recruiting process, to inviting high school kids to games, to watching your best player go down to injury, it gives you a sense of the hectic life some of these real life college coaches go through on a daily basis, let alone coaching at the same school for 20 years.   Also featured in Legacy mode is the ability to play in the high school games you're scouting, the chance to edit your schedule to make things more challenging, and a number of season awards including the James Naismith, John R. Wooden, ESPN Sports, and Coach of the Year trophies. There are also a variety of user challenges that are presented, everything from simply dunking the ball to committing zero turnovers in a half, and when you accomplish the goal you are given points that you can use to unlock special items in the student store, including classic teams like the Michigan Fab Five, alternate jerseys, and the ESPN standard air hockey table.   There are a few gameplay hiccups along the way, however, that need to be addressed. Throughout a variety of games, the computer has pulled some really bone-headed moves. Players will dribble the ball out of bounds about once a game, I've seen a player take a jumper from behind the backboard, and the computer has a tendency to call time outs while they're running up court in what looks like a fast break situation. There is also a little bit of a stuttering frame rate that seems to happen for the most part after a made basket. The camera sometimes has a hard time turning back around to start the next play, and instead of being able to immediately take the ball out of bounds, you're stuck watching a stopped screen as the announcers catch up to the action. These annoyances don't happen all the time, but still, it's little things like this that keep the game from really grabbing the elite status of games like EA's College Football series.  Graphics  The players look amazing close-up, from their hair down to their kicks. The only thing is, since these are likenesses of actual players and not the players themselves (wink, wink), even if your favorite player plays like the guy you see on TV, and looks somewhat like the player you know, there isn't that level of shocking detail like there is in ESPN NBA Basketball. When you see Kenyon Martin, you're in awe of his every tat. In College Hoops, you're more like, hey, his hair looks like Josh Childress'.    For all you graphics junkies, the game supports 480p on both the Xbox and PS2, and the addition of cut scenes and added variety of stadiums really gives each game a unique, fresh feel appeal to it.  Sound  The team of Mike Patrick and Jay Bilas might have all the good lines, but they're dreadfully slow at pulling them off, and often times, even wrong about what they're commentating on. There was an instance where Patrick was talking about the point guard dribbling the ball at the top of the key, when my small forward was actually dribbling. There are times when they're talking about how good a steal was when the ball has already changed hands two times since. And there was one time in Legacy when they talked about my point guard having a chance to score 20 points this time up the court, when he had fouled out the series before. Again, these don't happen all the time, but it's still a big brick. It's the mark of good game when the more you play, the more you want to play, and that's exactly how I feel about ESPN College Hoops. Sure, the game has its flaws, but Legacy mode and Slam Session provide so many thrills and so many hours of good times demanding a wave of everyone in the room, that it's definitely worth the time and money invested. It's everything you love about college basketball without all of the boosters, bribes, fixed grades, and corruption. There's always next year.", "date": "Nov 14, 2003"}
