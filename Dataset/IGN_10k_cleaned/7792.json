Well, it's hard to swallow that, so to speak, since a couple years on since the PSP's launch, we're still getting chopped-down versions of superior PS2 games.   V8 Supercars 3 Shootout, the PSP version of V8 Supercars 3 (and released as ToCA Race Driver 2006 in the US and Europe), is basically just that - another port. However, it would be unfair to deny that the developer hasn't made the most out of the limited PSP hardware, and released a game that generally plays very well.   World Challenge is where the meat of the game lies. Starting off each of the five difficulty-based challenges is a number of licence-test-style skills tests. Clearly the inclusion of these skills-tests was for those who feel that they need some sort of reassurance that they're capable of controlling a high-powered vehicle. Perhaps these were included because the developer thought they were 'fun' and expanded the overall experience by fleshing out the mode with micro-scenarios.   However, instead of testing our abilities as race-car drivers in any practical way, the skills test tedium sometimes borders on pointless and instead test our patience. Sure, such tests are supposed to teach you skills, but honestly, how much skill is gained through simply overtaking an opponent inside of two laps? Such a silly test is a no-brainer and what we'd call 'gameplay-filler'. Others, under the guise of car-control, ask you to stick to an average speed, a clean racing line, choose an appropriate pit-in time and, irritatingly, complete a race with no damage. The 'no damage' test allows you to pass with plenty of damage - which left us scratching our heads. We're admittedly thankful for this, since getting through upwards of three laps against the vicious AI without trading paint is a big ask, even for a seasoned veteran of the series.   Considering the limitations of the hardware, the PSP version cranks out some great vehicular and environmental detail.  Progression through these trials awards you access to the next test - and there is no skipping ahead to the next task if you happen to get stuck. It's not so much that Codemasters is asking gamers to complete such trials that bothers us, but rather in the way they are presented. The structure of the World Challenge mode is so rigid that it borders on tedious. There is variation in the later tasks, but by the time you're half way through the game's offerings, you'll feel like a seasoned racer - yet here you are again, taking braking tests. Sure, the desire to perfect each task and receive a gold trophy is there, but we'd prefer to race for the glory of competition, not skills-based achievement.   The AI is a little unbalanced at times - NASCAR stadium races are way too easy to blitz through, after the initial scuffle for position, whereas a more standard mountain circuit is a constant battle for rank retention, let alone improvement. They also tend to be a little overly-aggressive, causing undue damage during tight cornering, in the hope of leapfrogging their position.   We're pleased about the inclusion of solid damage modelling - the car is divided into key areas and components that, with every collision or sideswipe, will progressively wear down. The five indicators, that light up from yellow to orange to red, sit on the speedometre and keep track of how much you can thrash your car before requiring a pit-stop or risking a blow-out.   Possibly the most impressive and certainly the most immediately striking aspects of the game are the graphics and sound. As in past titles, it is clear that Codemasters have sought to replicate the visceral experience of circuit racing down to the finest details. How far can the PSP be pushed, graphically, before the system turns red-hot, begins to smoke and creates a legitimate fire hazard? About as far as Codemasters dare to push. Graphically, V8 Supercars is a stunner - car models are beautifully rendered and careful attention was clearly paid to simulating the physics of acceleration, deceleration and balance.     When taking to the track, the cars shift on their shocks and roll around turns as impressively and realistically as the console versions (and indeed the watermark-setting Gran Turismo series). Quick turns cause your chassis to flex and bounce, and the sound effects are satisfyingly realistic, as are the varied levels of engine noise, which is noticeably muted when driving with the cabin interior point-of-view.   The muffled shriek and crunch of twisted metal, distant cheering of crowds and crunch of gravel under tyre all add to a convincing racing experience. Most impressively are the audible subtleties that are most apparent when heard through headphones, and not the PSP's tinny speakers. Even hearing the high-pitched whine as your car slips out of gear and you lose control on a bend is enough to make you feel a little guilty about the inevitable, race-destroying crash.   Graphically, as mentioned, the game is surprisingly detailed and there are very few other games in the PSP racing category of this visual peer. The tracks are instantly recognisable and populated with stands, trees and roadside details that can be collided with at your peril. Running into a line of orange cones and watching them land with excellent physics, to be collided with again on the next lap, is smile-worthy. Even the lovely reflections off the polished car bodies, sun-appropriate shadows and glare of light off the tarmac are delightfully well done.   Of course, such extravagance comes at a price. With races featuring up to 20 other cars on-screen at a time, the engine takes a significant hit. The framerate definitely tumbles down whenever there are more than a handful of vehicles in view.    Some very familiar Australian advertising grace the cars and billboards for added realism and money-spinning.  Australasia GP, the third selection of races in the World Challenge, will feel very familiar to fans of Australian racing. All of Australia's major raceways and events are present - Clipsal 500, Sandown, Eastern Creek, Indy 500, Mount Panorama and many more. With the staple inclusion of Holden and Ford teams and their associated drivers and iconic decals, this is an Aussie racing fans' dream. It's great to see local content of this quality being released on a portable system.   There are also a few novelty races thrown into the mix - NASCAR, retro and truck racing with a few classic series of cars also included for purists. These are unlocked for use in the time trials and multiplayer mode by completing the training tests - again, clearly another reason for their annoying inclusion.    During the time trials mode, you can adjust many of the aspects that make up the structure of your chosen racer, including the gear torque ratio, suspension, ride height, anti-roll calibration, the tyre construction and brake bias - all of which can be saved for later use if you happen to fall in love with your custom setup. Free race is also included, with the option to customise most on-track variables, including AI difficulty and car setup.   Multiplayer via ad-hoc wi-fi allows for up to 8 racers to compete with whatever vehicles and courses have been unlocked in the main game. NASCAR cars or trucks and utes can only race on ovular courses, however, whereas a more traditional racer can only use more complex courses.    The PSP version suffers from poor joystick controls, rendering the analogue nature of steering nearly impossible. This shouldn't come as a surprise to most gamers, since this is an inherent issue with most PSP driving games. That said, the sins of the father should not be held against the son and the D-pad is very useable, since the sensitivity is far better calibrated than the analogue stick. With careful breaking and plenty of practice, understanding the finesse of V8 Supercars' racing engine becomes second nature. With no sign of Gran Turismo coming to the handheld anytime soon, this is as good and fully-featured a racer as any petrol-head could hope for. Though it's not without its flaws and inconsistencies, we're happy to report that this series is still running smoothly in handheld form.", "date": "Dec 11, 2006"}
