This review contains information about the characters and locations in the movie, as well as a good bit of the plot. If you are adamant about not knowing anything at all about The Phantom Menace before you see it in the theater, we recommend you don't read this review until you've seen the movie. You have been warned.  Now that my ass is covered by that disclaimer, I guess it's safe to continue.  Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a third person over-the-shoulder adventure game that puts you in control of the good guys from Lucas' latest in the Star Wars franchise.  The game follows the plot of the movie very closely, almost scene by scene, as the idea behind the game is to allow you to re-experience The Phantom Menace entirely in game form. The cutscenes use dialogue from the movie and the action/adventure sequences you play are a mix of scenes from the movie and the parts that might have happened in between.  It's actually pretty neat to think of the game as the scenes between the action that you saw onscreen.  In the game you play as four of the different lead characters.  While most of the game puts you in the robes of the two main Jedis, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, you'll also get to play as Captain Panaka, leader of the Queen's guard, and even Queen Amidala herself later in the game.  Of course, the primary weapon of the Jedi is the lightsaber, but there is also a hefty compliment of other armaments (like blasters, missile launchers, thermal detonators and Gungan energy balls) that you'll come across as you explore each location.  There are even a few heavy weapon emplacements that you can jump behind to take out wave after wave of battle droids.   The movie's plot is reprised over twelve different levels, though the action of the movie has been extended with additional NPCs, more places to explore and much more combat.  You'll start your adventures just as the movie started: in a conference room aboard a Trade Federation battle ship awaiting the arrival of the Neimoidian ambassador.  Things go badly aboard the ship (if you're the kind of person who considers a big cloud of poison gas bad), and you're forced to fight your way out of the battle ship, onto a troop transport and down to the surface of Naboo.  The rest of your adventures will take you across the galaxy, to Tatooine, Coruscant, the Theed Palace and other locales from the movie.  You'll even get a chance to take on big, red and ugly himself: Darth Maul.  It's a fairly large game overall and it should take you at least thirty hours to complete.  While The Phantom Menace is touted as an 'adventure' game, it's actually an action game heavy with traditional adventure game elements.  Most of the puzzles involve finding the right button to open certain doors, pushing blocks around so you can get to places that would normally be out of reach and those ever-frustrating jumping puzzles.  However, The Phantom Menace does include a few larger quests that actually require you to travel around to different parts of the level to complete.  For example, one mini-quest involves getting a T-14 engine part from Watto so you can get the Queen's starship up and running again. This can be handled by visiting Watto's junk shop and returning with the proper item.  Graphically this game is pretty sharp.  The characters are somewhat stiff and the natural environments are rather blocky, but everything is well detailed and there are a lot of little graphical touches (like lightsaber burn marks, superb explosions and reflective surfaces that will mirror the onscreen action if you are close enough) that provide much needed eye candy for some otherwise repetitive backdrops.  The cutscenes in The Phantom Menace are really choice and the game is almost worth playing just to relive scenes from the movie in computer graphics form.  Gamers have come to expect top-notch sound from LucasArts games, and The Phantom Menace certainly isn't one to disappoint in this arena.  As I mentioned before, there are several lines of dialogue directly from the movie. Everything is crisp, clear and mixed well, making for one fulfilling aural experience.  The sound effects will be familiar to any of you who know anything about the Star Wars movies.  There's the hum of the lightsaber, the clomp of droid feet and the 'p-choo' of the blasters.     However, as good as the game looks and sounds, the game falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to gameplay.  It's not fantastic, but it's not crappy.  There's certainly nothing innovative here.  It just follows the same tried-and-true action/adventure formula.  While there's nothing glaringly wrong with the game,  there are certainly lots of little things that could have been better.    The biggest downfall of this game is the fixed camera angle.  Instead of using a camera that is set at a slight angle behind the character's shoulder  la Tomb Raider, Big Ape Productions decided to set the camera at about an 80 degree angle from the floor, making it incredibly difficult to see what's happening more than twenty feet in front of you.  Of course, this extreme camera angle also makes it impossible to tell what's happening behind you, so prepare to get shot in the back a lot.  The camera angle is to blame for making the jumping puzzles harder than they should be as well.  It's difficult to judge your jump arc when you're looking almost directly down on your character's head.  This makes some of the jumping sequences more difficult than they should be and ultimately makes some portions of the game an exercise in frustration until you get lucky enough to make a sequence of particularly harrowing jumps.  The control interface is also frustrating and hard to get used to, even after extended play.  There's no side step, just a side roll or jump, making it difficult to line up for many of the jumping puzzles.  The keyboard is awkward to use and a joystick is pretty much useless, so I'd suggest going with a gamepad for the best control.  It's a shame that Big Ape didn't include more Jedi powers.  As it stands, you can only use two powers in the game: the force push and the Jedi mind trick. Where's the fast run?  The super jump?  The telekinesis?  While the force push comes in handy during battles, the Jedi mind trick is a scripted event that can only be used when you're talking to NPCs.   Overall, The Phantom Menace is a mildly entertaining game that can be extremely frustrating and quirky at times. The game does rely heavily just on its Star Wars credentials and I have a feeling that if the game weren't set in the Star Wars universe it would be easily overlooked.  It is addictive, though, and I was tempted to crawl out of bed on several occasions to try to get past another friggin' jump puzzle.  But I do wonder how good it could have been with a better camera angle and more character development.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "May 28, 1999"}
