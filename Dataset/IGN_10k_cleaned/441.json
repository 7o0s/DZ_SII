Take for example the latest of the Army Men games, Air Attack. These little green devils make up an entire air force command, complete with a cacophony on helicopters and trained men to pilot them.   Air Attack, a one- to two-player game, pits the Green army forces once again against the Tan in an all out attack of the local neighborhood (in single player), and enables players to go against, or play with, one another (in Deathmatch or in Co-op mode). Any way you decide to play, Air Attack is a refreshing take on the shooting game, and one that makes for great, lightweight fun.  Gameplay In the 16 single-player missions, you take on the Tan army in the ongoing battle to control the backyard or nearby park, whichever this troupe of little green men have decided to inhabit. It's an all-out battle for territory, plain and simple. You fly a set of four different helicopters that open up each four levels, and each with a different set of capabilities. You start with the Huey, and them move on to the Chinook, the Super Stallion, and the Apache, which is the ultimate in hardcore, fast, armored, and well-loaded air copters. Players also get the chance to pick a co-pilot, each with a lightly different personality and specialty. From the hours we played, it didn't matter so much who you chose, but which helicopter you chose, to decide a win.   The helicopters move easily across the screen with either the analog or digital pads, but it's clear the game is really created with analog control in mind. The analog control is the most fluid and intuitive way to maneuver and strafe (the R1 and L1 buttons assist in strafing, which comes in very handy in battle most of them time). The helicopter control is arcade-like, meaning it's simplistic and instantly accessible. The copter always stays the same distance from the ground and never blows up from bumping into, say, a mountain or an opponent, for instance.  Players access a primary weapon (machine guns) and a secondary weapon, which ranges from guided missiles to rockets, and more. Players also have access to a winch, which comes into play for power-ups, and moving objects, such as donuts, cherry bombs, and more. The easy controls are perfect for head-to-head combat, and projectile patterns are set up just old school shooters, like R-type Delta or even top-down shooters.   But it's the winch that's an awesome addition, enabling missions to vary and become more complex. One mission, for example, requires players to free a set of insects from ~weird~ Tan experiments, while protecting your bases. Once you get the idea, it's pretty simple and fun. Blow up the containers holding the bugs and they retaliate by destroying the Tan constructs. OK, so that doesn't use the winch. I just like that level. Another level requires you to lead an army of ants away from your bases. How to do it? Move the sugar-powdered donuts they love to eat. Ants like sweet things, right? Press O, pick up the donut and place it right in the middle of the Tan base; watch the clever, hungry ants follow, and duly destroy the Tan base. Fun stuff, Captain!   OK, so the single-player levels are fun, and grow increasingly hard at about level 6. It's OK by me, but I zipped through the first five missions without losing more than one life and then level six forced me to smarten up. So, yeah the curve right arches upward there, and I'm glad about it (but it is abrupt). I was worried the game would be too easy to that point.   But it's really the multiplayer and coop levels that are the real blast.  The first time I played this game at E3, I ditched a meeting, and spent it instead with the two Air Attack designers, trading wins and losses for an unmitigated hour of pure fun. It was addicting and innocent joy. I simply couldn't deny the game's charm, and I've been waiting for the final version ever since. Play in either coop mode, which is relative fun, or go head to head in a battle to the finish. The later one is obviously my favorite. One game and you're hooked.  Graphics The visuals of Army Men Air Attack are pretty straightforward. The worlds are 3D, but your helicopter can only move in 360 degrees, not up or down (It's by no mean a fault, otherwise the game would be too difficult, it's just a clarification). The Army Men you've possibly seen on the PC or in Army Men 3D on PlayStation are the same here, little plastic men with heavy weaponry. It's the backgrounds that are intriguing. Actually, it's the insects, to be honest. Giant bumblebees, ants, and lots of other little critters scamper or fly around and they simply look cool. And they'll attack you if you're not careful.  The backgrounds are worthy of note, too. The 3DO developers set the game in a real world filled with ordinary suburban items, sizing the Army to look small in comparison. So, in one level, players must protect a train from point A to point B. The train looks like a Tonka toy, and the environment resembles that of a young child's backyard. Another level requires you to save the base from the ants (which are bigger than you), and it takes place on a checkered picnic cloth, complete with empty soda cans and containers of Spam. The Lilliputian effect works perfect, and I was transported back to my six year old days, using any old object imaginable for my play setting or Army Men.  Sound Possibly the worst parts of the game are the music tracks and the sound effects. They're not so bad that you won't want to buy the game, but they're simply not up to par with the rest of it. The music is simple military fare, just like Army Men 3D, and it gets old after one level. The military snare and marching themes get old real fast. Try something else! It's time!   The enemy voices are completely in line with the most inane of Saturday morning cartoons, except it's indistinguishable from any other bad guy voice you've ever heard. Like a poor man's Snidely Whiplash. The standard Green force voice-overs are just as primitive, except they're stereotypical ~personalities~ used to distinguish one insane gunner from another. If they had some funny jokes to tell or added some humorous asides, and they spoke like Stephen Hawkings they still would be better than these. Not only is the production on the voices bad, but also so are the transitions from level to briefings and back to levels.   The one exception to the bad sound voices, at least in my mind, is found in this hilarious level in which you free the insects from the Tans. When you free the insects from their cardboard box, this weird metallic buzz issues out, and they say, ~We're Freeeeee!~ It's so weird and almost out of place that it's funny. With more of that kind of wackiness, the voice and sound effect department would have been great.Like I said before, this is a fun one-player game, but a very addictive two-player game. The analog controls make for perfect battles and head to head warfare, and the winch and all of the secondary weapons are totally intuitive to use. Don't, however, count out the single-player missions. Initially, I thought this would simply be a great two two-player game. But the single-player missions kept me enthralled with the various missions, tasks, and funny interactions with the animal and insect life all around. Unlike its predecessor (Army Men 3D), Army Men Air Attack is a smooth looking game with a lot of fulfilled potential. It brings the air aspect of the Army Men universe into play, and creates a for more intriguing aspect for players who simply wanted more out of the Army Men series. It's not the end all be all, but it's straightforward fun and should by no means be over-looked this holiday.", "date": "Nov 24, 1999"}
