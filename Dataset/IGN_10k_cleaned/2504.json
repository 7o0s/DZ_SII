This is Electronic Arts' recipe for one of the most satisfying arcade-infused basketball videogames ever created. It's name: NBA Street. Originally created for the PlayStation 2, the GameCube version sees its release nearly eight months later with several notable improvements in an all-around more polished package. For basketball enthusiasts NBA Street is definitely worthy of your attention, offering up trick-based controls, impressive visuals, tight three-on-three matches, and a rewarding multiplayer mode.   Features  Over-the-top arcade style action brings sweet moves and a rough game to the court.

Electronic Arts started it's ~Big~ label of extreme, even to the point of fantastical sports titles with the release of SSX snowboarding at the PlayStation 2's launch on October 26, 2000. Thanks to its unique controls and exaggerated gameplay style it was an instant hit, receiving critical acclaim over most of the other PlayStation 2 software available at the time. GameCube owners are probably more familiar with its offspring SSX Tricky, the even more blown up sequel which released for the new Nintendo console near its launch. Using the fantastic game engine, EA with the help of developer NuFX gave the world of basketball a much-needed injection of trick-based controls and pure attitude. The result is NBA Street, a game that throws out the nearly all the rules of basketball -- bar travelling -- to bring the exact opposite of a simulation to gamers. This is why it's called NBA Street. Imagine the games that take place in schoolyards, shady courts, and on rooftops of inner cities. Now envision this already overstated setup with gravity-defying dunks, head-cracking elbow swipes, and a furious pace. You'll get a glimpse of what NBA Street is all about.  The big top three-on-three baller features modes including City Circuit, Hold the Court, Create-a-Player, and Street School. The latter, Street School, is simply a training mode. The announcer Joe ~The Show~ walks you through the control mechanics and rules in real-time. It's quite a handy training session because if you're walking into NBA Street blindly there's a definite learning curve there to fully understand how to take advantage of the tricks system. You even get a reward for completing Street School, making it well worth your while. It's a setup that makes the experience all the more intuitive. Once you adapt to the control scheme -- and it won't take that long (especially if you've played SSX Tricky) -- you'll probably want to head right into the City Circuit. This is the single-player mode where you slam your way to the top, travelling to different areas of the country to take on the NBA teams and three of their best players. There are a total of 13 courts hosted in the dark streets of Philly, under the glowing neon lights of Miami, and on icy afternoons in Boston. There were only 12 courts in the PS2 version. NuFX has added in Washington, D.C.'s ~The Paint~ court, which is quite lovely, we might add, with its verdant foliage and vibrant graffiti.    Thankfully, City Circuit is not just a mindless quest to become king of the street. As you move along and defeat teams you can draft any one of the three NBA players for your own custom squad. Or, if you have created your own player you earn skill development points based on how high of a trick score you garnered. To give the circuit a bit more of street quality, you will face off against rough 'n' tough teams from each region. For example, a large British fellow by the name of Biggs, a 6'9~ beast with a few talented friends to help him steamroll a path to monster dunks. Of course if you rock Biggs' world, you'll be win him for your custom team. The layout all adds up to a very rewarding single-player experience and thanks to three excellently balanced difficulty settings you can find the perfect challenge for you. And trust us, you'll definitely need to be a rim rockin' badass to compete on hard.      So what makes the NBA Street controls so special? Like SSX before it, you use combinations of the turbo buttons with one of the trick buttons to perform fancy dribbles and bone-cracking assaults. You can then link these fakeouts into dunks for high-point combos. Different types of dunks are performed with the same types of turbo combinations, and more skilled players with impressive stats will be able to pull off the more glorious slams. Also, new to the GameCube version is the ability to call picks with the C-stick. In the PS2 version you had to try to run the defenders into other players to pull them off you. Now you can call on a teammate to aid you in your quest to break out rim rockin' dunks. The injection of tricks into this exaggerated style of b-ball works splendidly. Working a path to the basket is filled with eye-bruising shouldering and showboating instead of the usually dribble, pass, fast break setup in simulations.

The Gamebreaker is a state state of godliness where you can score either a one-pointer or two-pointer that deducts the same amount from your opponent's score, making for very strategic use of it. For example, if you're down by four and get a two-point Gamebreaker the score will become tied. They are very hard to come by, though, and require a lot of trick moves and impressive combos. All said and done, the game becomes fun on both sides of the court. When you're defending you can goal tend and steal without a care in the world. This makes NBA Street incredibly fun in multiplayer -- a heart-pounding demonstration of skills and pure attitude between you and a friend.   To add to that, NBA Street has a fairly robust Create-a-Player mode that let's you create your own custom baller. You can choose from a fair amount of looks and can even select a name that Joe ~The Show~ will call out. You can imagine how happy IGNcube editor Fran Mirabella was when we created The Franchise, who truly rocks the courts with his mad handles. It makes the City Circuit all the more rewarding when you get to power-up the attributes of your very own player. Then, when you've crafted the perfect baller, you can head over to you friend's house to take them on in Hold the Court. Your high scores will even save on their memory card, creating a constant reminder of how you humiliated them.   Graphics NBA Street looks great -- for a PlayStation 2 port and for a GameCube title to boot. It features a total of 13 courts, all of which have a distinct look to them. The snowy Boston, MA court features piles of snow and reflecting puddles, whereas the all-new ~The Paint~ venue sports a sprawling and detailed graffiti-painted wall in the background. Additionally player models of all your favorite NBA stars are accurate, even in the replay mode that zooms in closer to the action. Everything is motion captured to give the players smooth, realistic motion, which can be seen with all the wild dunks and falls to the hard pavement. Many of the ballers will even stop to taunt after a dazzling basket. And, to further highlight the action NuFX has a good effects system in place for the Gamebreaker dunks and busted rims.     Certainly it could have looked better, but it's an all-around polished package that stands up well despite its ties to the PS2.  Sound Perfectly befitting of the game's general theme, NBA Street offers gamers a remarkably good hip-hop soundtrack that helps set the general tone of the game. This is backed up by character voices that while a bit stereotypical are never totally offensive and help really make you believe that you're playing ball on the city streets.   For color commentary, Joe ~The Show~ offers up some outrageous pre-, post- and in-game commentary that'll rip into you when you're playing like a chum and praise you as the next coming when you're on the top of your game. We found out quickly that when you start walloping on the CPU, Joe will tell you to up the difficulty. The commentary and excellent background music is accompanied by a lot of mood-setting ambient sound effects.   You'll hear murmurs from the crowd, lots of different background chatter and even the occasional yell from the stands. The only thing that'll keep you from believing that you're not actually out there on the court is the fact that the game makes use of some outlandish sound effects that you'll never hear in the real world. This is far from a bad thing as the different sound effects do nothing but enhance the game experience, by making the impact of things like dunks and blocked shots extremely powerful.NBA Street was one of the few titles I played on the PlayStation 2 during the drought of good titles it suffered from in its first year on the US market. Similarly, GameCube is now lacking a great number of top-notch titles. If you haven't played the PlayStation 2 version to its death, NBA Street for GameCube is an awesome experience. It gives fans of basketball simulations the chance to forget all the rules and go all-out, performing monster dunks and beating their opponents into a pulp. And, for those intimidated by regulation basketball you can leave all that behind you, focusing on performing tricks and showboating across the court. It all wraps up quite nicely for an impressive package. The only problem I have with it is that it does come eight months after the PS2 release. If you own a PS2 the C-stick passing, new court, and updated rosters (M.J. is nown on the Wizards) may not be enough for you. Additionally, GameCube is missing the equivalent of the L1 button. They got around it for the tricks with use of both the X and Y buttons, but for dunks they're skimping on a few. Also, for those that have bigger hands, the GameCube controller can present a problem when trying to grip all three trigger buttons. Still, all-in-all I highly recommend NBA Street. It's polished and delivers tight gameplay, and it doesn't hand out sloppy seconds. There is almost no better sport game to create your own player and engage in intense multiplayer matches with friends. Now, if only I could get Matt to actually create a player that could compete with The Franchise. But, I suppose few ballers can.", "date": "Feb 25, 2002"}
