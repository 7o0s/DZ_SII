Starting out as a point-and-click adventure called Police Quest in 1987, the series has gradually evolved from combining items in your inventory to a first-person emergency simulator starring the elite officers of SWAT. The Stechkov Syndicate is the first proper expansion pack we've seen for this series, and Irrational works their usual fascinating voodoo; no matter how divergent their output, it's always impressively good. As you've probably heard by now, Stetchkov isn't just some additional missions. Irrational has made several significant changes to both single-player and multiplayer, from additional weapons, enhanced tactics to more dynamic enemy AI. It's also reasonably priced at $19.99, in retail or downloadable versions.     There are some occasional quirks, though, when dealing with such a complex system. While Irrational's SWAT probably has the most intelligent team AI I've ever seen, they aren't smart 100% of the time. When gameplay revolves around carefully moving from one room to another, minimizing risk to both the team and the people already in the building, pathing can become an issue, especially when the scenarios have multiple routes and even multiple starting locations. If I use the new delayed order mechanic to tell one half of the team to stack up against a door, then take the other half to another door that enters the same room, the guys at the first door will walk through the room if I tell them to fall in, instead of following my path. And occasionally they will not initiate the joint room rush, instead either standing there silently or saying that they're already busy with something else. Sometimes it's because the door is locked, but other times their hesitation can't be explained. It doesn't happen often, but it's annoying, especially when they refuse to fall in and let you start from scratch.   You see, there are no save points in SWAT 4. You either succeed or fail, and it can take a while to creep your way through a building, especially when a single stray bullet can kill you and end the mission. And these missions are tough. Plus, since the locations of people and items are slightly randomized each time, there's only so much you can learn about a level before you have to fall back on tactics. Lastly, many missions will end if one of the hostages is killed. Your men are very good with their aim, but the suspects can be a little trigger-happy. Sometimes they'll attempt to kill a hostage who's right in front of them, and other times they'll run to another location before you can draw a bead and kill someone in another room. So unfortunately, there's more luck involved than I would like.     Despite certain stylistic choices and AI quirks, there's a whole lot to like about Stetchkov, and SWAT 4 in general. Irrational is excellent at filling in a world with those little details that you don't usually think about. For me, it's the incidental dialog. Each team member has a distinct personality. One guy is a cool, calm operator, while another is gruff but loyal, and they'll have some brief back-and-forth conversations about music, video games, and other topics. More importantly, these guys all sound like officers who are used to high-tension situations and working with each other all the time. It feels like a real team of people, in other words, a team that's both very interested in the safety of civilians and very interested in taking lethal action against anyone who threatens the lives of the people they've been sent in to secure. You might play poker with these guys one night, or go bowling, but you'll always be able to tell from their demeanor that they're not to be messed with.    At any rate, this refreshingly human group of people also benefits from missions that are actually linked together this time around. It's more fun than the isolated scenarios of SWAT 4, and the missions are more involved and usually larger-scale than what we had before. More complex building geography and more hostile suspects makes for some tense inching along. Many missions involve multiple tiers, where you have to maybe secure a balcony or walkway overhead before you can proceed down below. But the enemy on the other tier often sees you and will either run or shoot, which is where sheer luck comes into play, especially when the randomization is mixed in. Every single room in the building has to be checked, even if it's only a broom closet or meat locker. On the bright side, each building feels lifted from a real-world location. Rooms have purposes, like archives in a government building, restrooms, ticket booths, projection rooms, dormitories, concert stages... you won't see a lot of generic office cubicles.     But since the enemy is often lying in wait, you'll have to be quick on the draw to avoid an early end to the scenario. My team members were shot and killed many times while in the process of opening a door and throwing a flashbang in, and for some reason our flashbang-resistant goggles don't seem to work as advertised. Every so often, my team members will blind themselves while trying to rush a room. (I use flashbangs almost exclusively because they have a wide radius of effect, unlike the stinger bombs, and gas requires you to wait a few moments until the air clears. You'll get a gas mask after a few missions, but it reduces your field of vision and is used in place of actual head protection.) Although it's often simpler and faster to take point and secure targets as you go, your death means Game Over, so you'll have to employ your occasionally unreliable team members to get things done.   Thankfully, multiplayer naturally eliminates problems with team member AI. You can play co-op with no fewer than ten other people, broken down into two teams of five. There's also voice over IP, and you can select one person to lead the team and issue commands. In multiplayer mode, you can also choose to have no body armor, which allows you to interact with objects a lot faster (restraining people, picking locks, anything with a progress bar, basically). When hosting a game, you can select whatever missions you want in any order, and all the original SWAT 4 modes are present and accounted for. There's even the new Smash & Grab, where one team plays the police and the other plays the suspects, and the latter has to get to the exit with a briefcase before the timer runs out. For those of you who want something more straightforward, the ~Barricaded Suspects~ mode is essentially team deathmatch. Rapid deployment is similar to CS defusal, but there are multiple bombs and they're randomly placed. If you still haven't found something that's up your alley, there's VIP escort, which is thankfully a lot cooler than the Half-Life version. The Suspects have to actually detain the VIP for an extended period of time, rather than just killing him.    With excellent production values, including an Unreal 2.5-based engine that looks like it's getting pushed to its limits, SWAT 4 is pleasing to the eye and ear. With challenging content, expanded multiplayer, enhanced single-player, and more weapons, there's plenty of game to be had. With randomization and a per-mission scorecard, there's replayability. The only real complaint I can level against the game is not how difficult things are without a save system, but the occasional brain farts my otherwise polished AI teammates will execute. The shortest path to me isn't necessarily the one with the least exposure, but this doesn't appear to be taken into account. Some may also find that the enemy is a little too quick and accurate with their firearms, but I'm willing to attribute that to the extreme intensity of the situation. In the end, the intentional challenges of the game make the unintentional challenges an occasional annoyance instead of an aggravation. If you liked SWAT 4, I recommend Stetchkov Syndicate.", "date": "Mar 7, 2006"}
