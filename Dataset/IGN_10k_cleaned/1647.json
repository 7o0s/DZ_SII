Justice Gakkuen (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/16/moero-justice-gakkuen-import", "text": "The amount of school spirit in Japanese educational institutions frightens me. While most of the club members in my old US high school were namby-pamby weasels, the folks I encountered in Tokyo and Osaka were hard-ass, near-pathologically devoted madmen (and women) who would bust a move at the drop of a hat. Even the ballroom dancing club was hardcore; the Sempais (lit. ~Big Kahunas~) would challenge me to submission wrestling matches inbetween the foxtrot and the samba. It was scary stuff.  This is why the plot behind Moero! Justice Gakkuen (lit. ~Burn! Justice Academy~) seems totally logical to me: a bunch of high-school students begin disappearing, so a trio of club members from each school get together and kick the crap out of random people to solve the mystery. A year has passed since the last multi-school pile-up, so you'd best be ready to see fresh faces, angry instrumentalists, and voracious volleyball players. Brace yourself ? one of Capcom's nuttiest properties just got a whole lot nuttier.  Moero! is a Dreamcast follow-up to the Rival Schools series on the Playstation, which was revered for its over-the-top fighting action and ludicrous team-up moves. Rival Schools was one of those ~experimental~ Capcom games, back when the company started dabbling in 3D fighters ? but unlike the Street Fighter EX disasters, the results were pretty tight.  Instead of cranky Shotokan Karate masters and over-energetic sumo, the Moero! cast features angry Japanese high school students ? there's Shoma, an irate baseball player, Roberto, a rage-filled soccer hooligan, Momo, a tennis player with a bone to pick, and Ran, a photographer who can barely suppress the urge to kill.  The gameplay formula also strays a bit from the standard, one-on-one brawler: you pick one main character and two ~backup~ fighters. The game plays like the bastard son of Street Fighter and Tekken -- there's a button for each limb, and executing the standard quarter-circle-forward gamepad rolls results in fireballs, shoryukens, and hurricane kicks. You can see a little influence from Marvel vs. Capcom in the form of two-story-high super-jumps, but the real treats are the utterly ludicrous team-up attacks.  That's right! Just mash two buttons, and your secondary or tertiary fighter will leap into the fray, executing a ~Burning Vigor Attack~ that gets an A+ in ~Pain.~ These hilarious, humiliating beat-downs are the big reason to play the game ? I won't spoil 'em for you, but anyone with a sense of humor will probably bust a gut at the ones involving the photography club and the synchronized swimmers. You can also do mega-team-up attacks, where all three team members start kicking the crap out of your helpless opponent. 'Tis good stuff.  You'll also find a brand-new Burning Vigor Counter System. If you execute one of your team-up attacks, but your opponent enters the counter command, you'll be thrown into a sub-fighting game. Here, the two secondary characters go into a ~sudden death~  mode, where the first person to hit the other is the victor. If you win, you get execute the subsequent Burning Vigor attack ? if you lose, the attack is cancelled.  There are a handful of gameplay modes to check out. For starters, you can battle your way through the original arcade game in Story Mode, where you choose a pre-set team and watch high-res cutscenes between each battle. You can also butt heads with rival institutions in Free Mode, where you piece together a personalized team of three. Training, Tournament, Versus, and League Battle Modes offer the expected variations, and there's an ~Omake~ (bonus) menu that lets you check out backgrounds, super-deformed character models, and all of the 2D cutscene art.  The slickest addition comes in the form of the ~Hot-Blooded Autumn Festival~ mode. In this full-fledged board game, you create your own high school student, and boogie around campus picking up new moves and special cards, while doing stat-based battles with up to three other players. At the end of forty turns, all of the cutesy, super-deformed players get together for a rumble. After the total number of experience points is tabulated, the characters are saved to the VMU for use in the actual fighting game. This mode is surprisingly well-designed for a freebie mini-game ? and it's way more fun than Sonic Shuffle. We can only hope that Capcom shows the initiative to translate this one for the American market, especially after they axed the original Japanese Rival Schools bonus disc.  The Rival Schools games have never been terribly impressive in terms of graphics ? after all, having four characters on-screen at once requires you to cut down considerably on the detail levels. The Moero! crew have been given a facelift from the previous game, and actually look respectable ? we're not talking Soul Calibur polygon counts, but it's good enough for the simplistic Anime look (not to mention that it's leaps and bounds beyond the hideous-looking Plasma Sword). The animation has been stepped up a bit from the last game, with cleaner motion-capture and more exaggerated movements. Oh ? and it runs at a seamless 60fps, so there's no need to nit-pick over frame rates.  I like Moero! Justice Gakkuen. Then again, I've always been partial to fighters where little girls beat people over the head with tennis racquets. Sure, there's nothing ground-breaking in terms of gameplay or graphics, but the overall presentation is goofy enough to get my nod of approval. If Capcom launches this one in North America for a lower price-point, go for it ? but you might want to hold off on a $60 import.
