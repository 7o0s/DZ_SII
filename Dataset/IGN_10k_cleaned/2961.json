It's easy to learn, filled with ~zany~ international personalities provoking love or hate, and the back-and-forth action is addictive, to a degree. And it fills that niche where Midway has yet to prove its worth, in the arcade soccer sector.    A quick look at 2001's crop of sports games will show you that for every Madden, there is a Blitz, for every NBA 2K2, there is an NBA Street -- and the end of 2002 doesn't look much different. It's the world's most popular sport, soccer, that doesn't seem to have an action counterpart. Sure, FIFA skews more on the simulation side whereas Virtua Soccer is a bit more arcadey -- but we're talking no-holds-barred multiplayer action where the referee likes to check out the chicks on the jumbotron rather than interrupt the game for off-site calls and fouls. Cue Sega's premier sports developer, Visual Concepts. Together with Black Box Games (of NHL Hitz) fame, VC is finally ready to plug that gaping hole with one hell of a soccer arcade game.    The only problem with the PlayStation 2 version is that, all-around, it's the least impressive of the three console versions. Graphically, the game delivers less shine and crispness than the others, it offers a jumpy framerate, and the difficult icon system makes it confusing as to which player is yours in a multiplayer game.    Gameplay  Sega Soccer Slam features five basic game modes: Quick Start, Exhibition, Tournament, Training, and Quest. The Quest mode is the center of the single-player experience where you will attempt to beat opposing teams in a set of matches and bonus challenges, similar to Sega's own Virtua Tennis. You'll have your pick of six multinational teams. Light your fire with team El Fuego, storm the field with Tsunami, spark up your life with Volton, or go for Toxic, Spirit, or Subzero. Each team comprises three individual players plus a generic goalie. The players characters are funny characterizations of cultural stereotypes: Some are of course more memorable than others, but no matter which team you'll pick, you're guaranteed an eclectic mixture of memorable cartoon/athletes. For example, there's an English punk, a Mexican wrestler known as El Diablo, an American ~football~ star, a snooty French soccer star, and a blue-haired techno-loving chick named Lola from Germany (Run Lola Run, anyone?). Each player comes complete with his or her own set of taunts and special moves, as well as slightly varying abilities. Like in cart racing games, the fatter players are slower but stronger, the smaller guys are faster but don't pack much of a punch, and so on.    The first time you play Soccer Slam, you'll be surprised at how tiny the playing field is. It takes a standard player about five seconds to run from one end of the field to the other. While that may sound like it's too confined, once you start to play you will notice that it's really the perfect size for this type of game. Sega Soccer Slam is not about intricate passing games or about strategically setting up a winning formation. It's all about speed and non-stop action. You never have to wait -- unless your opponent chooses to torture you with a replay of his latest goal, of course.    In a nutshell, Sega Soccer Slam is this: Pass the ball, punch your opponent in the teeth, pass the ball, transform yourself into a human torch, pull off a bicycle kick in the air and try to score in the most spectacular way you can. The action is as much soccer as it is Final Fight. You can foul, punch and slide tackle your opponent without worrying about ever getting red-carded. As a matter of fact, there's no referee in this game at all so the rules of soccer are all distilled down to the smallest possible denominator: Get a point by kicking the ball into the goal. Want to punch the goalie's lights out while your buddy sets up a goal kick? Go head. Just don't come crying to us later when the goalie goes medieval on your ass in return.   As you progress through Quest mode you earn cash from both matches and challenges, which you can use to buy your team power-ups and concept artwork (which contains codes, such as Big Head Mode, Black & White mode, etc). Because each team is rated by speed, hitting, passing, shooting and stealing, each item will help improve upon one of them. Get the shark teeth shin guards to improve hitting or get a pair of earrings for better stealing. There are a total of nine power-ups per team -- three per player (not including goalie), which play a major part in defeating the harder teams as you progress. Every time you finish the Quest mode with one of the teams, you unlock that team's home stadium. Sadly, that's about it as far as single-player depth goes.    The game is a blast to play, but after you've played through the Quest mode with two teams the novelty starts to wear off. It would be a different story if you could unlock additional teams (where's our Sonic, Tails, and Amy team?) or if the new stadiums actually had special features for the players to interact with. As it stands, the new stadiums are merely eye-candy, which is a waste considering the over-the-top look and feel of the whole game.    How cool would it be if the arenas were more than just flat fields? I could imagine a level with a river in the middle that slows you down slightly (unless you cross the bridge in the middle)... Or how about a stadium that goes slightly up-hill giving one team an advantage during the first half and the other one an advantage during the next? An arena with less gravity, perhaps? The possibilities are endless -- but even some basic interactive elements on the sidelines, a create-a-player, or a bomb tag mode could have broadened the game's appeal in single-player considerably.   Thankfully, the inclusion of power moves and the killer- and spotlight kicks add a bit of variety to the game. Killer Kicks are performed by building up your power meter all the way, then passing the ball high into the air. A cone of light will then appear from which you can deliver a devastating goal kick. The Spotlight Shots are similar, but you don't have to pass to set it off. Instead, you have to track down a team-specific moving spotlight that appears on the field from time to time and deliver the shot directly from there. Both maneuvers will move the camera behind the player and switch the game into slow motion, drowning out most of the audio except for a player specific chant. It's a really sweet effect that makes scoring all the more exciting.    And the developers were nice enough to include a fairly large number of options, including four difficulty settings, variable game speed, manual and automatic goalie control, as well as adjustable side, corner, and end camera positions. A manual replay mode would have been a nice addition (there's only an automatic one when you score) to relive some of the nastier tackles, but the overall lineup of options is solid.    While the GameCube version of this arrived in March, the PS2 version, like the Xbox port, offers a few bonus additions that may be worth your while if you don't own another system. The PS2 game offers nine additional characters and two mini-games, Hot Potato and Brawl, which are fun, little extras that don't add up to more than say, two to three extra hours maximum, but aren't substantially huge new incentives.   The Challenge mod enables you to create your own team of superstars. Grab three favorite players, place them on your team, select your theme (Volta, SubZero, etc.) and you're ready to go. Take on mix-and-match teams over four rounds. Win and you unlock one of nine new characters. To unlock one of the new teams, you have to have all three characters from that team unlocked, so it will take a little bit of time.    The best thing about this mode is that you finally get to have your favorite characters on one team. Because each team seems to have one stand-out character, but none of the teams have three great characters. So gram El Diablo, Angus, and Kahuna and you're set. It's still too bad this isn't included in the Quest mode, but it certainly adds a bit of variety and spark to the game.    The mini-games are a good distraction. It's just too bad that, despite the many single-player options, once you have played anywhere from two to four games, you've pretty much done it all. Also, this game just doesn't have the appeal if did on the other systems, mostly because of its hampered speed, downgraded graphics, and overall lack of polish. If you have seen and played the Cube or Xbox versions, it quickly becomes apparent that the PS2 version is the weakest of them all. The choppy framerate makes the super-fast game look much worse than it should, and it does affect the gameplay's smooth feeling as well as its speed.     Multiplayer   While the single-player experience isn't bad, Sega Soccer Slam is a multiplayer game at heart. If you have two or three buddies who love to play videogames, it's worth your while to at least rent this. Sega Soccer Slam enables you to play cooperatively with two friends through the Quest Mode, or compete against each other in four-player matches of any configuration. There's no set-up time -- you simply move your icon to the team you want to be on, or, if you want to lock yourself into controlling a specific character, the player you want to control.    On the PS2, load times are still kept to pretty low after the initial load and you can bypass victory celebrations and goal replays at the touch of a button after the first four to five seconds. The one-liners that characters spurt after scoring a goal add to the vicious party vibe.     Graphics   Soccer Slam goes for an over-the-top cartoonish look that's a far cry from the stuff you've seen in other soccer games so far. The characters are nicely detailed down to their accessories and animate extremely well. The developers did a decent job on making sure all the characters have a personality of their own and the attention to detail really shows in their varied running animations, mannerisms, and special moves. There are also some nice special effects for the power-up moves, such as trails of fire or puffs of smoke that resemble skulls.    Texture-wise, the game doesn't break any new grounds. The grass textures looks nice when the camera zooms in close and the field deteriorates over time, but some of the field logos look pixilated and the actual stadiums could have used a little more panache. On the flipside, Sega Soccer Slam features animated polygonal spectators that are a huge improvement over the usual 2D crowds. Framerate, you ask? It looks like it runs at 30 fps, and occasionally runs over, but the inconsistent framerate and the chopped up animation just arent anywhere near what they looked like on the other systems. The PS2 version is just short of a visual travesty compared to the other two.    Sound   Soccer Slam forgoes the licensed ~flavor of the week~ music that most sports games tend to go for nowadays and actually features a really nice selection of techno beats and character-specific jingles. Sound effects and surround crowd noises are also quality stuff with good use of the rear channels, but the commentary is a major disappointment. Tim Crofton's deadpan delivery may sound like real (British) football commentary, but he just doesn't have a lot to say.   Given Sega's track record with funny and varied commentary in the past, it would have been nice to actually have Crofton comment on the players' backgrounds during the game. Off-beat two-man commentary, a la ~Best in Show,~ would have really fit to the hilarious visuals. While the essense of Sega's fun-loving soccer game is still indeed intact, the harsh tarnish its gathered in the porting process makes it a much less desireable game on PS2. Much less. The fluid play is no longer there, the smooth look and quick, rapid-fire play is pretty much diminished, and the whole experience just feels dampened. This game is fully capable of producing an excellent party sensation, but don't count on it providing the same long-term quality play as ISS or FIFA. The novelty just wears off so quickly it's difficult to recommend this to any serious soccer player.Sega Soccer Slam is, at its core, a fun, arcade-style game, but now that it's out, I would just as easily recommend Red Card Soccer as I would recommend this. In other words, rent first. Buy only out of desperation.", "date": "Sep 23, 2002"}
