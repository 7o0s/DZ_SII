True story. While fans of flight sims and adventure games would love to enjoy this kind of variety, the sheer number of options does create some problems in terms of identifying the high quality titles from the ~me too~ schlock that surrounds it. One of last year's more impressive offerings was Stormregion's Codename Panzers: Phase One. The title suggested that a sequel was a good bet and, sure enough, here we are nearly a year later faced with Phase Two.  Before we talk about how enjoyable Phase Two is, we have to address an issue of semantics. For some gamers the term sequel usually creates an expectation for some sort of innovation in terms of mechanics or visuals. Gamers who are expecting a substantial reworking of the Panzers model are going to be disappointed. Those who approach Panzers as a sort of stand-alone expansion or a giant mission pack are more likely to be satisfied with this latest offering.  Where Phase One showcased the European conflict, Phase Two moves the action to the Mediterranean area of operations specifically through North Africa and the invasion of Italy. One campaign has the player leading Germans and Italians, another the English and Americans, while the final campaign (available only after the other two are completed) puts the players in charge of Yugoslavian Partisans.  Players of the first game (or of RTS games in general) shouldn't have too much trouble picking up the basics here. It's a standard right-click affair at heart but there are a few subtleties to consider. The interface is very slick, giving you access to lots of options within an easily readable format. Rather than forcing you to manage hundreds of units (like Sudden Strike or Blitzkrieg), Codename Panzers: Phase Two gives you a powerful set of dozens of units. This means that your army is easier to manage overall but it also means that you'll have to be more careful with them since you'll have fewer of them.  Even though the scenery is different, the overall mission design should seem very familiar as well. As the player fights through missions designed around the historical operations (Tobruk, Husky, etc.), they'll discover that the missions are a bit tougher this time around. As before, the mission stories revolve around hero units and are revealed through letters home and in-game cutscenes. The cutscenes are still a little stiff, sure, but the grainy filter and the overall shape of the plot still go a long way towards keeping you interested in the context of the missions themselves.   Not surprisingly, the missions themselves are the real draw here. Rather than tasking the player with wiping out all the enemies on the map, the missions in Codename Panzers: Phase Two are instead focused on more limited goals. You'll sometimes simply need to hold out against an enemy attack until reinforcements arrive. Other times you'll have to intercept and destroy a certain number of enemy vehicles en route to a key location. Still other times you'll be tasked with capturing a town square. Though the maps themselves aren't overly large, the specific nature of the objectives leaves lots of room for interesting tactical planning. Better still many of the missions shift you from offense to defense, or swing back and forth between small unit infiltration and massive set piece battles. A wide range of optional and secret objectives adds to the replay value here.  You'll want to make a point to grab as many of these extra objectives as possible in order to earn yourself more prestige points. These prestige points can be used to buy new units before the next battle. These new units can also be outfitted with certain bonus items that enhance their combat options. Since your units can gain experience and carry over from one mission to the next, you'll find that these green troops, when looked after properly, can grow into indispensable battle-hardened veterans. Adding mine detectors to infantry for instance makes them better able to scout ahead of your vehicles.      When you're done with all that the campaign has to offer, you can make use of the game's skirmish and multiplayer modes. The skirmish maps are a nice option for trying out new vehicles and tactics before heading online. Though the game's marketing materials suggest that there's some sort of cooperative mode, all it amounts to is a team-based multiplayer format. Cooperative mission play (like that seen in Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2) would have been a nice treat.  And if those options still don't satisfy you, Phase Two comes with an entirely new map editor that lets you design your own missions. The versatility of the tool should please those who have the patience to wrestle through the lack of documentation.  I had no complaints about the number and variety of units available in the original game so the addition of something like 20 new units here is bound to be a boon. While the new units don't necessarily fill any specific tactical holes, the new toys are designed to fit the new theater and forces. As before, the unit modeling is based on the historical performance of the units in question with some liberal tweaking for the sake of fun. The massive 88s that could kill a Sherman in one shot aren't quite as deadly for instance but their relative usefulness is still preserved.  The idea of flamethrowing tanks and trucks that can instantly repair or resupply units in the field are another concession to fun that's still rooted in reality but implemented in a way that maintains the pace and intensity of the game. The same could be said for many of the game's features, from the lightspeed response of air support to the ability of your riflemen to get rid of landmines by shooting at them. At the end of the day, CDV is more interesting making Codename Panzers a franchise that draws on the flavor of World War II rather than adhering strictly to the reality of it.  For me that means it's more fun than games that tend to skew more towards strict authenticity. That doesn't mean that players of the game won't come away with an appreciation of the Opel Blitz or the ability to recognize the differences between M4 and M3 tanks; it simply means that the developers use accuracy only as a means to generate exciting gameplay. The purists may scoff but we'll be too busy enjoying the game to notice.   The stats and values of each unit still matter, however, and the interface does a good job of making the information clear and relevant. As with the previous game, one of my favorite touches is the inclusion of armor facings for vehicles. Moving around to flank enemy armor becomes a compelling need. That the state of each armor facing is shown in graphical terms when you select your own units lets you read, at a glance, which of your units is in most dire need to repair.  A thermometer icon also shows how close your vehicles are to overheating. While it's not always a reliable strategy, using Molotov cocktails or flamethrowers to heat up enemy units forces the crew to bail out. Once the vehicle has cooled down, any player can send in a vehicle crew to take it over.  I was a big fan of the Gepard graphics engine the first time around and, though little has been changed, it still manages to captivate me and communicate the intensity of combat. The range of camera movement really shows off the spectacular visuals. The unit design is absolutely first rate and you can literally count the rivets and treads on the tank units. Infantry are no less spectacular; their uniforms and animations are very convincing. There's a real sense of weight to the units as well. You can see this in particular when trucks struggle to race up a hill or as the tanks rock back and forth when they move. The spectacular explosions also give a good sense of the physics behind the game.      The environments are just as great. Though there aren't any real surprises here, the overall terrain looks a little bit better this time around. Small touches, like camels in the desert and birds flying overhead lend an aura of realism to the game maps, while a wide variety of buildings and structures makes each town look unique. Better still, everything in the game can be shot/bombed/run over/etc. so you'll get a real sense of the destructive nature of these battles. Seeing tanks smash trees or artillery strikes demolish houses really puts you right there in the thick of the action.  The new nighttime effects are brilliant and add lots of atmosphere to the game. Seeing the action played out in the dark of night adds a new level of anxiety to the game and opens up new tactical considerations. Since sight ranges are more limited at night, you may be tempted to activate the headlamps of your vehicles. The light will help illuminate the area ahead of you. On the other hand, the use of lights will make it easier for your enemies to see where your vehicles are. Less obvious but still just as impressive are the missions that shift from day to night or night to day. Seeing the dawn come up after a long fought battle is an amazing sensation you're not likely to forget.  Moving beyond the purely visual realm, the sounds in Codename Panzers: Phase Two are a bit less impressive. I definitely think that the overall quality of voice acting is better this time around. Peter Weller does an excellent job as one of the heroes of the Allied campaign. As with the first game, damaged units will respond with a crackling, broken voice that lets you immediately know that something's wrong. Still, the unit acknowledgements are endlessly repetitive and start to grate on your nerves. It's great that they offer up another level of awareness by calling out key events during the battle, but hearing the same thing again and again starts to get distracting. This is much worse for the broad accents of the Italian troops.  As before, the overall sound palette is fairly pleasant. I still think the battles sounds convey an appropriate sense of weight. Rumbling engines, the crack of rifles, and vehicle explosions all conspire to maintain some sense of believability. The martial score works as a suitable sort of background coloring for it all.   Phase One was good enough that even this cynical, jaded strategy gamer was anxiously looking forward to the sequel. The slightly cinematic slant of the game and the clear focus on fighting made that first game very easy to love. Happily, the sequel preserves all the qualities that made the original so attractive.Strangely, Codename Panzers: Phase Two's strength may very well be its weakness as well. The gameplay and overall presentation is as fantastic as it ever was but the real problem is that it's not any better than it was in the previous game. While fans of the first game may still be hungry for more content, it may be hard for some players to escape the ~been there, done that~ feel of the sequel.Still, I find this game to be much more enjoyable than the slightly more realistic, more massive approach of games like Blitzkrieg or Sudden Strike. In the end, the change of scenery is enough for me to want to play this game. If Phase Three does nothing but add even more missions in an entirely new theater, I'll still be first in line to buy it.", "date": "Aug 9, 2005"}
