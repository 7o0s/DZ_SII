Yes, it was a long and enjoyable adventure, but the original game was a bit tedious with way-too-frequent random battles and a storyline that got a little too complex and political. Capcom's sequel, Breath of Fire II has just hit the Game Boy Advance, and I'm pleased to say that this game irons out a lot of issues I had with the original. The new adventure features nearly identical controls and gameplay, but offers a better storyline, more likable characters, and less-frequent random battles. Overall, it's a much more enjoyable RPG experience on the GBA than the original was. Features Quest that lasts more than 25 hours  Battery save (three slots, one instant save)  Link cable support  Only for Game Boy Advance Breath of Fire II apparently takes place approximately five hundred years after the first one. Everyone from the original game is dead and gone, and the second quest picks up with you assuming the role of an orphaned boy named Ryu, a lad who has a connection to the lead in the first adventure in the series. The game's storyline is woven a lot better in this sequel; instead of overwhelming the gamer with a huge plot right up front, the game's structured from the point of view of Ryu. He doesn't have a clue what the White Dragon Clan or the Black Dragon Clan are...the quest and story unfold as Ryu goes about on his business as an errandboy with his lifelong chum Bow. It's only when Ryu gets deeper into his adventure that he realizes who he is and what he has to do in this world...and you're along for the ride, learning the history just as Ryu does. That's what makes this adventure a lot friendlier than the original.  The game's structure is nearly identical to the original Breath of Fire, complete with the same control scheme and menu systems. As you gain more members in your party, you gain additional abilities both in the wandering phase and in battle: Ryu can fish if you equip him with a rod, Katt and Bow can hunt in designated spots for health items, and Sten (a monkey-looking critter) can extend his arms to stretch across small gaps on the map. Each of these characters also have distinctly different fighting abilities, a lot more varying than the characters that your lead character came across in the original Breath of Fire. Like the original, Breath of Fire II adds to the SNES game design by including link cable support for item trades between two quests, so if players have acquired a certain element that you don't have yet, you can swap it for something in your cartridge save. Enemy battles are still of the annoying random-type, meaning that you'll enter a fight at random times during the wandering phase of the adventure. But it's been tweaked in this sequel: as you go up in levels and experience, the areas that you've wandered across in the past have less frequent random battles. The wandering-to-battle ratio is a lot better in Breath of Fire II than in the first game on the GBA.  And while the sequel uses a similar engine to the original game, Breath of Fire II looks and sounds slightly nicer than its GBA precursor. This can be attributed to the fact that the Super NES version had better assets to work with...and the GBA's elements are obviously based off the SNES version. The character designs look a lot cooler in this sequel, though the game's imagery still aren't quite up to par with Golden Sun. The same slightly annoying elements from Breath of Fire still show their face in this sequel: text fields are extremely limited, so you can only use four letters to name your character, and items still have that cryptic spelling that look worse than abbreviations in personal ads...but that's still a minor issue. I'm really amazed at how much I enjoyed playing the sequel over the original game. The storyline and characters make Breath of Fire II a much better game than the first adventure in the series...even though the game hasn't changed a whole lot. Oh, sure, there have been a few tweaks here and there to move the game along...but if you're learned with the way Breath of Fire worked on the GBA, you'll be in familiar territory with the sequel. With a much more involving storyline to boot.", "date": "Apr 15, 2002"}
