{"name": "Tokyo Bus Guide", "name_review": "Tokyo Bus Guide (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/tokyo-bus-guide-import", "text": "From the team that brought us 1998's forgettable Dreamcast launch title July comes Tokyo Bus Guide, one of the most original games yet seen on the Dreamcast.  The game may be rough around the edges, and will occasionally bore, but Dreamcast importers looking for something different will want to try their hands at the title. Tokyo Bus Guide's premise may seem at first like Crazy Taxi, but it's quite the opposite.  You drive a bus through a city, going from bus stop to bus stop, picking up and dropping off passengers.  Along the way, you'll encounter moving traffic and pedestrians.  The first major area of difference comes about when you realize that the path through the game's three main courses is strictly linear.  Stray off the pre-set path, and you'll be given the boot faster than you can say ~Please Exit Out the Rear Door.~  Instead of Crazy Taxi's ~CRAZY~ driving, where any pedestrian is the target of your bumper, and no sidewalk is too high or crowded to drive upon, Tokyo Bus Guide requires that you obey the rules of the Japanese bus driver.  You need to keep your speed below the speed limit, stay in one lane of the road (you can switch lanes, but you'd better signal ahead of time!), make an announcement before each bus stop (you just have to press a button), close the bus door when departing a bus stop, and stop at all red lights.  Disobey any of these rules, and you loose a bit of your life.  Loose all your life, and you get kicked off the road.  Do anything too severe, like hitting a pedestrian or another car, and you'll find your life depleting all the way down to the big zero.  Bummer.  The game is quite rigid in forcing you to adhere to these rules, but you shouldn't have too much trouble figuring out what's going on, thanks to the solid presentation.  The bus interface is done nicely, clearly showing your current speed, the maximum speed, how much life you have remaining, and the time by which you need to arrive at the next stop.  Visually, while the game doesn't really look good, with some of the worst shading on the Dreamcast, the graphics don't get in the way of the game by any means.  You'll find lots of polygonal traffic during the game, sometimes up to twenty cars at an intersection, along with crowds of sprite-based pedestrians lining the street.  The street signs, visible on the road before you clearly spell out where you can and can't go.  If you have trouble in spite of the presentation, you can try out the game's practice mode, which can be thought of as a set of drivers tests, vaguely like the mini games in Crazy Taxi.  Also available is a story mode where you witness the activities of your passengers, through voiced, still-frame event sequences involving a wacky cast of CG characters.  The story mode progresses over a period of days, with certain events appearing only at certain times, and any event that you've witnessed gets indexed for future viewing.  So how's the actual driving side of things?  The feel of the bus seems to be spot on.  Not that I've driven a bus or anything . . . if I were to drive a bus, though, I'd want it to feel exactly like this.  FortyFive has the huge turning radius of the bus down cold, and when driving from the in-the-car perspective, you sorta get the feeling that you're experiencing life as Miho, the Tokyo bus driver herself.  The control over the bus is questionable, though.  The game features full analogue control, for steering, breaks, and acceleration.  Unfortunately, the acceleration is too sensitive.  Most of the time, you're required to keep your speed at around 40 miles per hour, and the control is set up so that you just tap the trigger.  Keeping precisely at the required speed limit is difficult - I often found myself having to release the trigger, then press it, over and over again.  The acceleration also makes it difficult to accelerate smoothly out of a complete stop, something that will result in a flood of penelizations.  This little problem combines with various other problems to lessen the Tokyo Bus Guide experience somewhat.  The courses themselves are very long (between 15 and 20 minutes), and driving can become monotonous after a while, especially since the game has a bad habit of making you go through long stretches of road at slow speeds.  The other traffic can also be a problem as the AI occasionally slips up and does something stupid, like stopping in front of you when you're trying to cross an intersection, or ramming into you.  The game also needs a persistent rear-view mirror, as opposed to the one that pops in when switching lanes and taking turns. Finally, the three default courses just isn't enough.  You can unlock afternoon and nighttime versions of the three courses by driving well, but these are just the same courses with different traffic and events.  If FortyFive had taken a bit of extra time to clean the little hiccups here and there, and maybe add a couple of extra courses, we would have had a must-buy here.  The game is certainly enjoyable, though, and the original concept makes it a suggested buy for anyone looking for something new.  Just remember . . . in Japan, they drive on the LEFT side of the road.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 5, 2000"}
