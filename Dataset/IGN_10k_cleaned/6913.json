{"name": "Sin Episodes Emergence", "name_review": "SiN Episodes: Emergence", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/24/sin-episodes-emergence", "text": "When we first heard that Ritual was doing another SiN game, we were surprised. The original was not exactly a hit, as it was overshadowed by Half-Life, which came out at nearly the same time. The 1998 version also had some bugs, stability problems and long load times that meant most gamers weren't willing to give it a chance. While Half-Life was setting a new standard that helped define the medium on its own terms, SiN was a celebration of action films and otherwise set firmly within genre conventions. The original comes free with your purchase on Steam, and frankly, it hasn't aged well. For its part, Half-Life's torch doesn't burn as bright as it used to either, but it can still be appreciated as a watermark. In this context, the re-emergence of SiN generates curiosity more than excitement, and the end result is perhaps what Ritual wanted its baby to be all along, since they have the technology to overcome the limitations they experienced several years ago. And although SiN Episodes still doesn't break out of the shooter stereotype, it's a surprisingly fun experience for the money.     As the name implies, SiN Episodes should not be seen as a budget title. It's the first entry in a series and heralds Valve's Software's vision of smaller games released more often at a reduced price. However, there are a couple elements, namely the underwhelming variety of weapons and enemies, that can make you feel like you're playing a taste of things to come, rather than a proper game. Episodes also gets off to a slow start, which is problematic considering the amount of content. But when it finally gets a full head of steam (no pun intended), you'll see how the experience shines. The tension mounts and never really dissipates until the finale. In fact, the shift into a higher gear happens so fast and maintains itself for so long that it feels like Ritual's creative spirit grabbed the game and shoved it to the next level. While it never generates the fascination or nuance of its current competitors, Episodes is fun in its own right.   At the beginning, our hero John Blade, the same macho man from the original, is strapped on a gurney and injected with a mysterious substance. The player is also injected with an eye-popping show of cleavage, as the heaving breasts of our nemesis Alexis Sinclair take up about half the screen, bobbing and swaying lasciviously as she bends over to inspect Blade. Thankfully, the frankly adolescent gratuity only rears its head one more time, in a brief dream sequence where Sinclair squirms around in a bikini. I'm a fan of the female form, but I did find myself cringing during both segments, hoping that no one was looking over my shoulder and wondering what the heck I was into.     On the bright side, the voice acting is accomplished, although Blade is laconic, letting his thonged sidekick and principal enemies do the bulk of the exposition. In a nutshell, Sinclair is up to no good -- busily creating a goo that turns people into violent mutants, and Blade must try to find an antidote to whatever he was shot up with, in addition to investigating the goo and attempting to put a stop to its spread. Radek, Sinclair's right-hand man, is the focus of Emergence, however, and your mission to eliminate his presence will take you through some familiar shooter environments: laboratories, sewers, office buildings, and warehouses. As with the enemies and weapons, there is little adventurous sprit in the game's design, until the climax. I hope you don't suffer from vertigo.   The music and sound are surprisingly good, however, and go a long way towards offsetting the overall purist-to-a-fault philosophy. Beyond the evocative blend of orchestral and electronic scoring, there's a constant layer of sound effects that both keep the player situationally aware and sometimes a little spooked. Sometimes it's klaxons, other times it's the ragged breathing of a beast somewhere around the corner. Supremacy Tower also has a PA system issuing a steady stream of amusingly condescending corporate messages that remind the employees that they are basically machines expected to do work, not think, and tow the line. It's all delivered by a soothing, female British voice that never sounds quite human.    In fact, the game has touches all around that help it overcome it's stereotypical core. In another section of the game, city port employees wander around a warehouse section, grousing to themselves and each other, and to you if you click on them. And there are posters all over the place with four-digit numbers you can dial into phones scattered around the game. They're akin to those Grand Theft Auto radio commercials -- a goofy diversion that you find yourself hunting down just to see what the next one has to say. One is an advertisement for zombie repellent, while another may be the voice mail of a polite revolutionary. You never know until you dial it up.     And while there are only three weapons in the game (and from what we understand, that's the entirety of SiN's arsenal), the pistol, shotgun and assault rifle each have heft and distinct tactical usage. The pistol's stopping power is on par with that of Halo, and it has a railgun-style alt-fire that's handy for plugging someone in one hit from a distance. The shotgun will kill the regular enemies in one hit at medium distance, and its alt-fire is basically the normal mode on steroids, good for one-shotting the tougher baddies. The assault rifle's main mode is underpowered, but it can fire grenades. Each alt-fire uses distinct ammunition you'll need to collect, but it's usually available in droves after taking down a rush of enemies who also drop little health packs and ammo.   This is where Episodes does break out of the box some -- if you find yourself getting overwhelmed and dying a lot, the game pulls back dynamically. Less challenging opponents will appear, and they may act a little dumber: not getting a bead on you quite as fast, not aiming quite as well, and not getting to cover as quickly. You'll have two sliders you can adjust in the options menu, one for default difficulty and another for how quickly the game reacts to how well you're doing. On the whole, the AI is nothing to sing about -- it's more of a shooting gallery than an attempt to simulate a combat situation, because you'll be nearly overwhelmed by batches of foes often. In fact, I often found myself just crouching down behind an obstacle or around a corner and popping out to hit them as they came at me.    The baddies of SiN are pretty suicidal as a whole, but they do die entertainingly. The guys with the jetpacks will go spinning wildly, sometimes on fire at the same time, before grunting with an explosive death. The chaingun soldiers explode from the waist up, and everyone else can go spinning end-over-end from a well-placed head shot. The chaingun guys do (and take) a brutal amount of damage, but you can often set up your kill with one of those alt-fires. The alternative is to duck and move, listening to their weapon wind down before exposing yourself for the attack, but that gets tedious and often isn't a luxury you can afford, as they very rarely come alone or sit back and let you take your time killing them.     You'll see them drop from the ceiling, pop out of doorways and from behind corners, and even be subjected to a few hair-raising ambushes. I admit I jumped more than a few times, but I rarely saw those ~monster closets~ that cross the line from tense to aggravating. There are also no booby trap piles of goodies that make any attempt to get more health and ammo an exercise in ~is it worth it to make the attempt, considering what will probably pounce on me immediately?~ The meat of the opposition is generally a known quantity, with its number being the tense mystery, rather than the manner of its appearance. And while the AI isn't very complex, its very relentlessness often balances things out. They will also attempt to flush you out with a grenade sometimes, which can kill you with a quickness.   While more than a few games leave me wondering what the developer could have done if they'd had more time and resources, SiN Episodes feels like a complete and polished experience that's been mulled over and considered for quite some time. Unfortunately, it often feels like a throwback to an older, streamlined style, where sheer explosiveness reigns over tactical nuance and variety. For twenty bucks, though, it still offers more than many shooters selling for full retail -- and it's only the first installment. It's no Call of Duty, or Half-Life 2, for that matter, but I won't deny that I'm looking forward to seeing where Ritual goes with the rest of this story.", "date": "May 24, 2006"}
