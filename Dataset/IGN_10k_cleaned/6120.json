You continued as long as you had quarters. When games were tough as nails and. when you finally beat them, you felt like you had really accomplished something -- no matter if you were the only person that knew it. That's kind of the feeling I had when I fired up Xyanide on my Sony Ericsson 710a. And while I liked it for a while, I gotta confess, I've grown soft. I guess I like unlimited continues, after all.   Xyanide is a horizontal-scrolling shmup in the vein of past shooters like Gaires and Gradius. Wave after wave of punishment erupts from the right side of the screen in the form of alien craft, which swarm and smash, filling the screen with enough bullets to drop everybody in eight OK Corrals. The only way to push these alien SOBs back to whence they came is to swoop over as many weapon power-ups as humanly possible, upgrading your basic blaster to such shooter staples as spread shot and laser cannon.   The more power-ups you acquire, the hotter your weapon becomes -- which is necessary because a few levels deep into Xyanide and you start to feel overwhelmed. And then when a boss ship chews up the screen, you're gonna be glad you took the risk involved in grabbing that extra laser cannon upgrade icon. You can also grab both a missile launcher and a satellite -- again, both familiar fare for fans of the genre.   One beef I have with Xyanide is its control, which isn't necessarily Overloaded's fault. You can only move your ship in the four prime directions -- no diagonals. Ugh. I know a lot of handset d-pads don't recognize the diagonal, but when you fill a screen with this many hazards, a diagonal maneuver is essential.   Xyanide is a looker -- well, at least, it is for those who grew up with games like Thunder Force II. The weapon colors and effects are total throwbacks, the alien ships are decently detailed, and the boss ships are huge. Enemy bullets are bright enough that you never run into one unwittingly, which is especially helpful in boss battles, where you must rely on pattern memorization. The background art is also quite good.  Xyanide is strictly for the old-school shooterheads. If Zuma is your favorite mobile game, don't bother downloading Xyanide. However, if you were weaned on the genre's classics and have a hankering for some shmup fun, Xyanide is a worthy download. It's fast, hard, and unforgiving. Just the way they used to make 'em.", "date": "Oct 4, 2005"}
