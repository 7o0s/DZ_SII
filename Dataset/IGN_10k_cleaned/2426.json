So it comes as no surprise that several Crazy Taxi clones have sprouted up from the gardens of competing publishers. One such game is The Simpsons Road Rage from Electronic Arts. The Radical Entertainment developed racer pits players as the hilarious characters from the animated television series and turns them loose in the city of Springfield to carry fares to different locations.   With The Simpsons as its theme, it's hard not to get some enjoyment out of Road Rage. Indeed, there is some satisfaction to be gained by delivering the many patrons of Springfield to their destinations (complete with voice-over work from the real cast). But in the end this is a game that fails to play up to the title it has so obviously built upon, and when the one-liners become redundant there's not much left for players to turn to.  The Facts   Meet up with 0ver 25 Simpson characters either behind the wheel or on the streets of Springfield begging for a ride Characters have unique relationships with each other, triggering special dialogue and animations Wreak havoc in 5 Springfield neighborhoods featuring over 100 Simpsons landmarks Bonus system rewards players of all skill levels and lets players choose which characters and cars they want to unlock Interactive worlds provide an intensely busy community environment alive with traffic and pedestrian interaction that adds to commuters' road rage Two-Player split screen action lets players beat opponents in a race for the next passenger, or steal their passenger mid-ride Jumps, powerslides, and speed-starts are all done with a simple arcade-style 3-button interface Cruise through a variety of terrain including hills, jumps, mountains, forests, and timesaving short cuts Story Mode allows for 40 to 60 unique passenger deliveries, plus seven mini-bonus deliveries Sunday Driving Mode lets players pick up passengers and explore the city at a leisurely pace   Gameplay Once again, the dastardly Montgomery Burns is up to no good. This time the rich old man has seized control of the city's transportation system, nabbing everything from cabs to buses, and has raised the prices considerably to make a quick buck. But the patrons of the famous town aren't going to stand for it. Everybody from Homer to Professor Frink has teamed up to start a different transportation service. It won't be easy as Burns' lackeys will be prowling the streets in search of carnage, but it's up to players to make sure the transportation alternative does not fall victim to the tyrant's monopoly. And so begins the racing adventure.  The Simpsons Road Rage is, quite simply, Crazy Taxi with a new skin. While Homer and gang have replaced the cabdrivers of old, the play mechanics have remained largely untouched. The idea powering the title is therein simple: gamers must choose a character (an initial five out of 18 are unlocked) and take to the streets of Springfield to pick up and safely deliver fares. A time limit is the biggest nemesis -- it constantly counts down and the primary way to extend it is to successfully drop off patrons, so the speedier the driving the better the outcome. Drivers may also knock out Burns' bus stops to gain extra time. To help players out, developer Radical Entertainment has provided a guide -- a hand located at the top of the screen that constantly points to the next destination. All cabbies need do is follow it and they won't become disoriented while burning rubber. The better, faster and crazier one drives, the more cash they earn -- and top scores unlock new vehicles and stages. It's all very familiar to Crazy Taxi owners.  What separates The Simpsons Road Rage from Crazy Taxi is the obvious: one heck of a fantastic license. Anybody interested in what we like to call ~the funny~ is almost certainly also a fan of the cartoon series The Simpsons. Over the years, the show has acquired a legion of unwavering fans, spoofed countless pop icons and in fact even influenced the increasingly cynical views of general America. The fact that gamers can drive as practically any of their favorite characters from the show is somewhat of a godsend for true fans, and Electronic Arts has spared no expense in this particular area. The publisher has quite obviously worked very closely with the voice over talent behind The Simpsons for a cast of videogame characters that perfectly mimics those from the cartoon right down to the witty one-liners. The dialogue is written specifically for the game, which is a nice plus, and certainly the first time players hear some of the speech interactions they will be amused. But -- and there always seems to be one with games of this type, the voice over work also unfortunately quickly becomes redundant. Two or three times through as the same character will wield the same one-liners, which aren't nearly as special the second or third times around. And a lot of the dialogue doesn't fit the scenario. For example, while driving as Grandpa Simpson, we picked up Bart, who first acknowledged his relative and then blindly said, ~Take me to the retirement home. Grandpa needs a sponge bath~ as if his grandfather was not in the car with him.  The play mechanics are fairly standard. Control is tight enough, it's easy to powerslide around sharp corners or manipulate ramps for some extra air. The sense of speed is a bit greater than it was for Sega's offering, but the car mechanics are nowhere near as satisfying. Indeed, the cartoony vehicles in Road Rage seem to float along the road without any sense of true weight. They don't really crash into anything -- they merely bounce against objects. This is easily the biggest flaw in the play of the title. The fact that gamers have done all this before in Crazy Taxi also weighs heavily on the replay value of Road Rage -- especially once the redundancies of the audio offerings kick in. True Simpsons fans will probably be drawn to stick with the action in order to unlock new characters and enjoy their short-lived intricacies, but just about everybody else will find themselves satisfied with a rental.  There is also an included two-player split-screen mode in which gamers can compete against one another for the best fare scores. This area repeats the action of the single-player game for two players -- which is both good and bad. On one hand the core of the game remains intact complete with unchanged objectives and an open city to race through. On the other hand the same drawbacks of the single-player game are apparent in the multiplayer one, which means it lacks depth and momentum.   Graphics The Simpsons Road Rage opens to a full-motion video of the Simpsons in 3D which actually looks much like the 3D rendered Homer in the Halloween Simpsons special from years ago. Sure enough, the rest of the game proves just as fancy. Developer Radical Entertainment has done an admirable job of recreating a tried-and-true 2D look for the 3D-crazed market as every character looks like their two-dimensional self and animated accordingly. The environments likewise resemble their animated counterparts -- and close Simpsons followers will even note that landmark locations are in their right spots (the music store next to Moe's, for example). Cars sway to and from in a cartoony-like manner, there are several different types of particle effects as objects break apart, water splashes up and tires burn around corners, and the framerate is generally steady, though it does drop here and there (particularly around corners). There are, on the other hand, some overly blurry textures on landscapes. Also, one wonders why no real cel-shading was used for the project, especially given that GameCube can easily accommodate the look and that, in fact, one of EA's other projects Cel-Damage capitalized on the style. But even with the omission, the general appearance of the show has for the most part been adequately realized.  Audio The audio portion of the game is perhaps its biggest selling point. Listening to original one-liners from classic characters like Professor Frink, Moe, Flanders, Chief Wiggum, Reverend Lovejoy, Snake, Apu, Barney and Groundskeeper Willie is nothing short of brilliant. Speech quality is clear and often very entertaining, though as we stated above, it quickly becomes redundant. The music selection -- nabbed directly from the series, sounds just like the real thing, meanwhile. No complaints.The risk of cloning a classic is that the new offering must inevitably be compared to the original. Unfortunately for Simpsons Road Rage, it's just not as exceptional as Sega's Crazy Taxi, even so many years later. What the title does have going for it is a fantastic license and the solid use of popular Simpsons characters and voice talent. For awhile, Road Rage delivers a funny, though not particularly original racing experience. But just as the one-liners quickly run dry, so does a compelling reason to keep playing the me-too racer.Seriously hardcore Simpsons fans (as in comic book store owner devoted) may consider picking this one up, but everybody else should stick with a rental.", "date": "Jan 14, 2002"}
