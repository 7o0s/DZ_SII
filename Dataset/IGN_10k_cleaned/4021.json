{"name": "HardBall 1999", "name_review": "HardBall 6", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/14/hardball-6", "text": "This is the first time the Hardball series has gone with the 3D look, opting for generic Direct3D support rather than specializing in any particular chipsets. While the new 3D stadium backdrops look pretty good, the players appear misshapen and the field lines are somewhat jagged, at least compared to other baseball games on the market, most notably Triple Play. Hardball 6's menus and management screens are also pretty ugly, which becomes annoying when trading players or studying draft prospects--moving the mouse over a player's name flashes a playing card across half the screen, amidst numerous flashing red buttons. Baseball games with management screens have got to ditch their bizarre looks for something usable, like text, when you need to look at something simple, like text. But back on the field, it's a different story.   The game uses a somewhat unique floating cursor that hints where the pitcher is placing the ball. While this isn't a unique feature for pitching, it adds a whole new challenge when batting--guess where the pitch is going and swing for that location with the D-pad. Also choose between hitting on the ground, in the air, or to the opposite field, in addition to the usual normal, power or bunt options of other games. While timing the incoming pitches can be a bit tricky, I found Hardball's batting interface to offer more options than other games.  Fielding and pitching vary little from other games. And like other baseball titles, Hardball 6 poorly presents important information about the players during the pitcher & batter match-up. For example, with a new pitcher, I might have no idea what the ratings are for each of his different pitches, and so I have to go to the lineup screen. I'd also like to see the batter's vs. RHP and vs. LHP percentages, slugging percentage, and the like. Double-tapping button two does bring up some more information compared to many baseball titles, but it's still not enough.  Generally, each set of innings in Hardball 6 does a fair-to-good job of presenting real baseball--not a big surprise. After all, the series has been around for a while. You can end up in some real pitching duels (I played in a 1-0 match between Walter Johnson and Gary Maddux, despite the All-Star and Hall-of-Fame squads at the plate) and home runs seem to come in about the right number. There are a few problems, however. The catchers are pretty sloppy about throwing out baserunners, and the outfielders are likewise anemic, almost always hitting at least one cutoff man when challenging a base hit.  The management mode is fairly complete, covering seasons, career modes, injuries, trades, a rookie draft and free agents. This is also the first year the Hardball series uses the full Major League license, both of the league's and the players' association. Unfortunately, new rookies use parts of the same names as retired players, which causes confusion, and the absence of salaries and payrolls detracts a lot from the realism of managing a big league team, something particularly pronounced in Baseball Mogul. (There's also the aforementioned problems with the loathsome management interface, something Baseball Mogul and Diamond Mind handle better.)  Despite its drawbacks, if you're looking for a fun, playable, on-the-field game with acceptable graphics, and also offers sim and management options, Hardball 6 is probably the best choice. The inclusion of a Hall of Fame team as well as the availability of player-made classic leagues on the Web also enhances its appeal. Perhaps future versions might include custom stadiums, uniforms and team logos. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
