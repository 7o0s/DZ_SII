This is an instance where the execution of the videogame comes off exactly as it was designed. The programmers got everything in the game just like they were told to do. The only problem is the designers weren't aiming very high when they came up with Arctic Thunder.   All of this is not to say AT is a boring old stick in the mud, it's just that the instant gratification comes and goes so quickly it can be easy to miss. If you're dropping quarters into a slot, you need a quick twitch game like this that's easy to get into so you won't be wasting your time or money. But if you're talking about dropping 50 dollars on a game for your Xbox, that's another story. Arctic Thunder doesn't have 200 quarters' worth of fun anywhere on the disc.  Features   Use weapon power-ups such as atomic snowballs, proximity missiles, super attack, snowbombs and more  Hand-to-Hand Combat -- Punch and kick opponents off their snowmobiles  Additional Power-ups -- Collect boosts for speed, shields for defense and health power-ups  Twelve Tracks -- Six open including Alaskan Pipeline and Blizzard in DC, and six hidden  Fifteen Plus Characters -- Six released including Willie Q., Candy and Agent 5, with more than ten hidden  Tricks -- Perform cool tricks while getting major air to gain points and upgrade the sled throughout the game  Upgrade Shop -- Increase the snowmobile's power, the number, strength and accuracy of power-ups  Battle Arena -- Battle head-to-head on several unique enclosed ice arenas Xbox -- two to four players)  Amazing Air -- Jump off edges of cliffs into lushly detailed worlds  Six Different Modes -- Race, Points, Battle Arena, Upgrade Shop, Training and Arcade    Gameplay  You can play this game with your eyes closed as long as your thumbs and fingers are strong enough to manipulate the stick and buttons. We're only going to go over this once so pay attention: left stick steers, A is accelerate and right trigger is attack. That is the recipe for fun in Arctic Thunder and it comes off like a hodge podge bachelor's stew of speed, chaos and a dash of fun.   It's all about unlocking tracks and characters in AT by winning races and gold medals. The famous ~rubberband AI~ that Midway is known for, always keeps you in the race if you start to fall behind and keeps you from getting too far ahead if you're leading. The end effect is that the racing seems simple, but ends up extremely difficult if you're not paying close attention to the little details. Most tracks will have a number of turbo boosts in a certain order that you will need to hit one after the other if you want to win. And that's only if you're in striking distance of the leaders. Other than that you can bounce all over the track and crash all you want during the first 75% of the race as long as you tighten things up at the end.  The chaotic part comes from all of the power ups, jumps and obstacles. Just like its boat racing counterpart Hydro Thunder each level of AT has its own theme with appropriate dangers and animations. Racing through the Haunted Forest means you'll have to watch out for giant mutant spiders and stuff like that. But with the rockets, grappling hooks, bombs, turbo boosts, invincibility and shield powerups, you'll have plenty of weapons at your disposal to deal with other racers. And it's in your best interest to deal out as much punishment as you can when you can because they'll be looking to do the same to you.   The mindless fun comes from all of the attacks that you'll be dishing out and receiving. It all happens so fast that it can seem like blind luck when you hit your target or when you avoid getting hit. The chaos is accentuated when you end up having to race the same courses over and over again to win gold because it's highly unlikely you'll win gold medals that first time through. There's just too much about AT that ends up NOT being under your control.   Graphics It looks and moves a whole lot better and a whole lot smoother than the Arctic Thunder that showed up on PS2, but there still isn't much dazzling going on. We're still on rails in this game and we're still only going to see what Midway wants us to see as we race by Lost Himalayan City and Blizzard in DC.  For what AT is trying to accomplish, the graphics and animation work well. Why waste all kinds of time and processing power on detailed textures of buildings and tractors if you're not even going to be able to see them for all of the explosions and speed? The riders are animated but only to the extent that they have to be in order to attack other riders. There's very little interaction between the riders and their snowmobiles.  In terms of framerate, Arctic Thunder stays nice and steady at 60 but it damn sure should considering how little this game is drawing and how strong the Xbox is.   Sound Big explosions and random sounds of destruction is what you're getting here. A few exclamations by the racers here and there is all there is for voice. But we did notice that Arctic Thunder doesn't support surround sound so don't worry about blowing out your subwoofer. This is because there's a ton of controller rumble in this game. They keep all of that Thunder in the palm of your hands where it belongs. Right off the bat, Arctic Thunder is a fun, easy to pick up and play, pure arcade videogame. It's accessible to gamers of all skill levels and ages. If you're over the age of nine and have played any other videogame at any point in your life, however, you will be bored with Arctic Thunder within hours. If you pick it up on Friday after school or work, you can squeeze all of the fun out of it before you have to go meet your girlfriend, wife or drinking buddies and you'll even be on time.Everything falls apart with Arctic Thunder when you realize that the sense of speed, variety of weapons and the personality of the course offer very little depth. What you see is what you get and there's nothing coming except more of the same. There's nothing about Arctic Thunder that simulates real snowmobile racing, which is why it could 've just as easily been done with boats and titled ~Hydro Thunder II.~", "date": "Dec 4, 2001"}
