Here Comes the Pain", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/24/wwe-smackdown-here-comes-the-pain-2", "text": "Originally spawned out of the same ideals that created the excellent Toukon Retsuden series, fans of THQ's Smackdown franchise have always kept their expectations phenomenally high. It was, after all, the first McMahon-licensed videogame to be wrestled away from Acclaim's 12-year reign; and the first product that industry insiders continually look towards as the foremost representative of its genre.  With every passing season the anticipation of its release continually drives its fan base into an absolute frenzy, and their seemingly endless list of additions and requests only appears to grow longer and longer by the year. Regardless of whether or not those appeals get answered, however, WWE Smackdown continues to sell faster than THQ can even hope to publish it -- with the hype surrounding this year's version, known as Here Comes the Pain, reaching a feverish pitch like we've never seen before.  But it's all with good reason really: as THQ has been promoting this fifth edition of WWE Smackdown as its most ambitious wrestling project to date. Boasting among other things a brand new grappling system, an expanded career mode, and the inclusion of some of the all-time greats from history of the WWF (WWE),  Here Comes the Pain has made a lot of promises to it users. And while the Los Angeles-based publisher and its Japanese development team at Yukes still have several elements to work on for future editions, WWE Smackdown! does more than a solid job of living up to its potential. Then again, with the excitement surrounding this sucker, it had better. Strategy Guide Available!  Let's Get Ready to Rumble!!  The best damned wrestling game of the year has a guide worthy of the sports greatest competitors. All 65 wrestlers profiled with complete moves lists, plus a full list of secrets. Get it now!  Get the Guide | See Other Guides  Superstars One of the most talked about aspects of WWE Smackdown every year is its ever-changing roster. Originally scheduled to include 69 different playable superstars, the final retail version of the game has been paired down by four. Though the removal of grapplers Johnny Stamboli, Nunzio, Hulk Hogan, and the Ultimate Warrior were definitely met rather harshly by the game's hardcore fans, the remaining lineup of 65 WWE personalities is still quite an impressive number to behold. By comparison, the Xbox-exclusive RAW 2 boasts 64 superstars while the GameCube-only WrestleMania XIX promotes 45.  In addition to the wrestlers numbered above, it's also possible to play as Jerry ~The King~ Lawler and Jim Ross. Though they can't be unlocked for exhibition or regular season mode in any way, they can be called upon as special tag team partners during a storyline if you play your cards right. Other than those two special characters, however, what you see listed below is everyone that you'll have to work with.

SlaughterTed DiBiaseThe Undertaker   Now despite the slight advantage that Smackdown holds over its brethren in terms of numbers, we can't help but feel as though there's a ton of established superstars that should have (but didn't) make the final cut. Bradshaw, Farooq, Maven, Shane McMahon, Sylvan Grenier, and Rene Dupree are but a few of the many established wrestlers currently enjoying WWE storylines that were overlooked entirely. And though it's common knowledge that the WWE has final approval over all its videogame lineups, the fact that those grapplers are missing still leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths.     Another sore spot for the roster are the roles given to the WWE women. Originally expected to be included in the season mode alongside the men, the game's expanded roster of females ultimately ends up becoming nothing more than exhibition fodder. Granted, you'll be able to assume the role of a couple of women for a singles or tag team match at certain points in your career, but there's no option to control them for an entire season on their own. Gail Kim, Molly Holly, Ivory, and several of the other established female wrestlers join some of our male requests as grapplers who have sadly been omitted.  The 11 included legends were definitely an interesting idea; and it is a nice way to counter Acclaim's solid-selling Legends of Wrestling series that was mysteriously absent for 2003. Unfortunately this particular segment of the roster quickly loses its novelty appeal after a few short experiences. Being able to control the Old School Undertaker, the Road Warriors, and Roddy Piper can be cool for awhile, but when looking at their value to the game in comparison to adding 11 more of today's active superstars, it's seems like an unfair trade-off.  But you shouldn't find yourself discouraged by this roster-based nitpicking. As despite our complaint list above, the 65 grapplers under your control behave and wrestle exactly as they're supposed to. With few exceptions, each wrestler on the roster has every single move they've ever used and do so with the same amount of frequency that you've seen on television. From Brock Lesnar's amazing (but botched) shooting star press to the standing elbow that The Undertaker uses for his grapple setups, it's all pretty much in there. They're definitely the most accurate depiction of WWE personalities we've yet experienced.  Match Types Easily outdoing last year's version in terms of match types, Here Comes the Pain should offer fans plenty of wrestling alternatives. Separated into eight central categories, players will be able to select from singles, tag team, and six-man tag team contests in addition to handicap bouts, hardcore matches, the Royal Rumble, Survival Mode, and Main Events. Much to our surprise, however, the ~I Quit~ competition and King of the Ring tournament that were found in last year's Shut Your Mouth have been expelled from the lineup entirely.  In their place, THQ has introduced three new match types to better fit with current WWE storylines. The most basic of these, known as the First Blood Match, takes advantage of the game's new damage system pretty effectively; allowing players to use whatever moves and weapons they'd like until their opponent begins to bleed, it's a fun and mindless way to challenge one another to see who can split the other one open first.  The second new match type is the famed Bra and Panties contest. Available only to women (with the exception of Stephanie McMahon and Create-A-Wrestlers), the Bra and Panties match works like any other competition; with the only difference being your goal -- which is to rip the clothes off of your opponent and leave her in nothing but her underwear. To accomplish this, all you have to do is press the D-Pad down and the X button at the same time when grappling or pinning an opponent and you'll have the chance to go after her shirt or her pants; depending on how quickly you press the button; your grapple meter will move in either your favor or your opponent's (more on that later) and you'll either fail or succeed. It's an interesting novelty match for sure, but not exactly the groundbreaking new mode all the advertisements are making out to be.  One feature that far exceeds the billing, however, is the all-new Elimination Chamber. First introduced at the 2002 Survivor Series, the Elimination Chamber is a massive cage-like apparatus that incorporates six wrestlers at once. But rather than send them in all at the same time, four of them are housed in glass tubes that open up one by one as a clock ticks down. Victories can come by either pinfall or submission and which wrestler is left standing when it's over wins. Luckily the videogame interpretation has captured this mode flawlessly; complete with breaking glass, the ability to climb on top of the tubes, and some frantic close-up action. Plugging in a multi-tap and using six players at once is highly recommended.     Of course there are returning staples to keep you busy as well. Ladder matches, cage matches, Hell in the Cell, hardcore street fights, slobber knockers, ultimate submission bouts, and various other instruments of destruction can be yours for the taking; With the further ability to customize these match-ups so that they can be transformed into tag team, triple threat, and fatal four way bouts, player shouldn't worry about running out of things to do. It's just too bad about the King of the Ring and ~I Quit~ omissions, though: as it would have been a great addition to have two pre-existing modes in there that could allow you to reenact the events of the '99 Royal Rumble and give you an opportunity to build your own tournaments in game. Oh well. Environments If you've played a Smackdown game before, then you're probably already familiar with the fact that you can travel backstage and continue the action. What you may not realize, however, is just how interactive these new environments can be. There are six backstage areas in all and each one of them includes a myriad of different objects and items that can be picked up and manipulated. Television sets, iron bars, wooden sticks, trash cans, sledgehammers, and a ton of other such weapons of mayhem are scattered all over the ground. But that's just the beginning of what you can find.  What's undoubtedly the coolest aspect of these background areas, though, are the deformable environments. While they aren't on the same level as War of the Monsters or Godzilla, the backgrounds can definitely start to resemble a war zone. Walls and windows will shatter, cars in the parking lot will be destroyed, and tables and other such furniture will break into a thousand pieces.  Additionally, there are a number of vehicles and climbable areas that you can explore too and every stage has a unique selection of what to choose from. Though admittedly the vehicles are next to useless (the motorcycle and bulldozer are funny conversation pieces, but have almost no use whatsoever), the structures that you can climb on top of actually prove to be pretty valuable. The Times Square stage, for instance, allows you to leap off the billboard in front of the WWE restaurant and you can even grab a hold of a ladder that's attached to a helicopter circling the premises. Needless to say, these arenas are far more entertaining than they used to be.  The arenas themselves have all been updated to reflect last year's Pay-Per-View sets and are considerable improvements over Shut Your Mouth. Pavement areas outside the ring are slightly bigger and allow for better movement and evasion from your opponents as well, and there are even a couple of new moves that can be performed from the outside the ring that you couldn't do before. Hell in a Cell contests and cage matches offer a little more room to maneuver too and it's a lot easier to tell what's going on because of this.  Our only real gripe in this department is that Yukes still hasn't fixed the wonky collision problems experienced when throwing someone onto a table or into the crowd barrier. Characters will sometimes just magically appear on top of an invisible floor laying down on their backs because the engine isn't sure if they should be sitting against a wall or laying in front of it. Not only does it look weird, but it can affect some of the moves and timing you're trying to perform as well -- making the flow of a match far less fluid. Gameplay The most improved aspect of Here Comes the Pain is undoubtedly the new grappling and counter system. Still resembling the old way of doing things on the surface, Yukes has done an excellent job of balancing its old school mechanics with a fresh control philosophy. Though it isn't on the same level as the ultra-deep Dreamcast version of Fire Pro Wrestling in terms of its configuration, the game's new approach is still a distinct step up from what it used to be. Critics who have given the series a hard time because of its earlier mechanics may want to rethink their position after playing this one.   Smackdown's changes themselves are actually pretty simple: in previous versions of the series, players were given minimum, medium, and maximum grapple attacks based on what kind of condition their opponent was in (normal, dizzy, or groggy). In Here Comes the Pain, however, the system has been changed so that gamers can guess less and strategize more. But rather than require you to hold a button for a certain amount of time or dizzy your opponent before performing a maneuver, HCTP enables you to use the Dual Shock's accurate D-Pad functions for a more precise and effective attack.  To use it, simply initiate the type of grapple you want to perform: Up and Circle for Power, Down and Circle for Submission, Left and Circle for Signature, and Right and Circle for Quick. Once the type of grapple you've chosen has been initiated, you can then press another direction on the pad a second time in combination with the grapple button to perform a different type of maneuver. Regardless of what condition opponents are in, the move you wanted to perform will be pulled off -- as long as you managed to do so before opponents could do one of their own.  As we mentioned earlier, the Bra and Panties match activates a slider bar that illustrates who is winning the grappling struggle between two women as they fight to tear each other's clothes off. The submission system works much in the same way. If one player grabs another in a bear hug, for example, the slider bar appears at the top of the screen with the name of both men on each side of it. Depending on that character's submission rating, a certain number of seconds will go by before the hold is automatically withdrawn; and it's within that time frame that the player is given the opportunity to make his opponent submit or get reversed if he's out-tapped. The trick is to hit any button on the controller as fast as possible -- which is hopefully enough to keep up with your opponent who is doing the same thing. It's a clever and interactive way to break up what was previously a foregone conclusion -- and one that's a lot more fun that it sounds.  While we're close to the subject of player ratings, the system that Yukes and THQ have devised this year makes for a much more realistic simulation. Eliminating the previously used offensive and defensive ability points from the earlier game, the developers have decided to build their superstars more like a sports team: with numeric ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 in five different categories. Strength, Submission, Stamina, Technique, and Speed are the attributes in question and each one affects a different aspect of your character. So while Ric Flair may lack the strength and speed to keep up with someone like Rey Mysterio, his submission, technique, and stamina ratings are so high that he should be able to outlast Rey-Rey for a hard-fought win.  When all these factors are used in conjunction with the new weight-detection system Smackdown's wrestling matches truly start to resemble those seen on TV. Though it does need to be mentioned that although this long-overdue weight idea is a welcome addition, it's still not without its problems -- namely when performing Smackdown finishers. As despite the fact that grapplers are broken up into four different weight classifications to keep Stacy Keibler from lifting Kane, the nature of the Smackdown finisher allows players to still perform lifting moves on bigger opponents if they activate it. It's a minor gripe, yes, but one that should definitely be addressed in time for the next one.  Two more new additions for Here Comes the Pain include the limb-specific body damage and two-button reversal system. Incorporated into the engine because of the previous game's tendency to end matches as soon as a Smackdown was performed, the limb-specific damage adds a very important dynamic to grappling; as submission artists will actually have to work a body part over if they want to make someone tap -- the days of taunting your meter to its limit only to perform a finisher and get the cheap win are finally over.  But the same could be said about last year's cheap reversal system as well. Separating the general reversal key into two for both strikes and grapples, the relocated counter system (now on L2 and R2) eliminates a lot of the random ~Square pushing~ that wily Shut Your Mouth players loved to expose. Because of this switch it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between a strike and grapple when facing certain opponents (namely The Rock and Goldberg), but it adds a lot more depth and strategy to a game that's best described as an arcade experience.     For all of the game's increased depth and added moves for each wrestler (about 20% more for each), however, the enemy A.I. still needs some tweaking. On the positive side, the computer varies its moves a lot more than it used to and shows increased aggression over previous installments (it's definitely the hardest of the bunch); but for all of its sound and fury, veterans should walk all over it in only a matter of days. You'll get plenty more satisfaction from the multiplayer hands-down.  Also problematic is the occasional bug that sees referees standing in the middle of the ring refusing to count when somebody is pinned. To be fair it only happened twice over the course of about 700 matches, but hey: if it happens, it needs to be mentioned. At least the refs will realistically only disqualify you for using a foreign object if they're actually looking at you; not if they have their back turned or if they're out cold on the mat.  Other minor quibbles are the same ones that we had last year: with certain moves not being able to be stopped because their animations takes too long to finish or they can't be interrupted. There are occasional collision problems too, and it can result in your punches, kicks, or weapon strikes missing an opponent entirely when it shouldn't. When compared with how often this happened in earlier prequels to Smackdown, however, the frequency has been noticeably improved.  Truthfully all of these issues don't take that much away from Here Comes the Pain in the long run; serving as nothing more than minor annoyances rather than glaring omissions. Either way, it leaves a little something more to focus on for next year's follow-up  Season Mode In reality (or for what passes as reality), Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment has always been about presentation and marketability. His popular roster of wrestlers enter the ring with unique and elaborate introductions and follow a multitude of different gimmicks and storylines in an effort to put on the best show possible. Once they're in the squared circle, WWE personalities become larger than life caricatures that are trying as hard as they can to sell the idea that they hate their opponent with all their being. Backstage, however, it's another story entirely: as most of these giant wrestlers actually turn out to be pretty good friends and enjoy a close-knit family-like environment. To its credit, Here Comes the Pain does a great job of capturing this and makes some significant leaps over its predecessor.  In possession of over 200 different storylines, the season mode in Here Comes the Pain was written by actual WWE writers. The majority of the plot devices that power this feature mostly come from the history of the WWE and WWF anyway. Contract signings, screw jobs, backstabbing tag team partners, championship tournaments, and gimmick-laden main events can make your first year in the business pretty damned exciting. Want to reform Degeneration X and feud with McMahon's Corporation? You can! Didn't think you'd be attacked after a PPV main event while walking backstage in an attempt to steal your hardcore title? Think again! From Shawn Michael's awesome sky-wire entrance at WrestleMania to Steve Austin blasting a nemesis with the hose from a milk truck, you'd be surprised at what THQ has left in store for astute and determined players.  After one full year on the circuit your season mode automatically ends; but players will be given the chance to import all of their records, titles, and stables into a new season should they want to continue. And while it's awesome to know that game keeps track of every wrestler's title history, win/loss record, and their most common opponents, it's the beginning of year two where the season mode begins to show its weaknesses. On the one hand, you have the fact that the CPU actually remembers your feuds and partners for some storylines (which is great), but then seems to forget them entirely the subsequent month. We had Vince McMahon on a mission to destroy us all month long but we could visit him backstage at the PPV where it was supposed to happen only to receive an extra Superstar point because he had confidence that we'd take the victory in the main event. Huh?      Another little snag is that by year two, a lot of the same storylines will begin to repeat (don't be surprised if you're nailed by a mystery man with a hammer every single February), and for every one or two new plotlines that expose themselves, three or four you will have experienced the previous season. At least Yukes did away with the god-awful first-person exploration mode that ate up load times and our souls in the previous games -- now moving from the arena to the backstage area is as easy as selecting it from a locker room menu. You can upgrade your attributes and buy unlockables in the Shopzone here as well, and even view your win/loss record if you're curious. It's all very user friendly and despite its later repetition, quite addictive. Creation Always one of the series' big selling points, the Smackdown create-a-wrestler feature is the last refuge for gamers who didn't get the rosters they were hoping for. Originally borrowing its ideas from Acclaim's long dead WWF Attitude, THQ has one of the best character builders around (matched only perhaps by EA's newest Tiger Woods title). While its core components remain the same, the Here Comes the Pain version of Create-A-Wrestler is its most extensive ever -- offering nearly everything that last year's version had and more (except in hairstyles, which for some strange reason are fewer in this game).  Of particular note this year is the all-new morphing technology. Allowing users to manipulate the 3D model of every body part imaginable, players will be able to construct much more realistic and believable characters. Though faces, noses, eyebrows, shoulders, stomachs, and several other selections could always be edited before, this much more advanced version of the approach not only makes character creation faster -- but more accurate as well. And one of the most requested features to CAW, the inclusion of teeth, has almost been fulfilled (sometimes a bizarre tooth-like substance is in there, sometimes it's not).  Also new to the mix this year is inclusion of sheer garments and clothing (think Christian's old shirt). These see-through bits of attire can act as independent pieces of clothing or an extra layer, adding a whole new level of depth to characters that still have somewhat painted on clothing for costumes (though it is less obvious than before). Best of all, you can now select any edited piece of clothing to be worn as an entrance garment only -- giving players full reign to come up with goofy getups before disrobing in the squared circle.  Our only real complaint is that it seems beyond the entrance attire, sheer, and face morphing, that THQ didn't think to add much else to 'move edit' portion of the game. Providing us with only three new original songs over last year and a handful of new introductions, the hopes that we could create a less generic-looking roster were slightly dashed. Surely this latest edition is the most robust and functional version of the bunch, but seriously: we've been listening to some of these songs and watching a lot of these old entrance animations for years -- give us something more to chew on. Graphics Here Comes the Pain have made a lot of admirable strides in the last year or so, and the visuals certainly account for that. Said to have re-animated 80-90% of the moves for each wrestler, a more realistic number is probably more around the 40% mark. Though it's not as radical as the previous number, these newly animated motions help to create a much more realistic wrestling game. Grapplers no longer bounce like fleas when they're hit with powerful moves; and the length and duration of their ~hurt~ animations match those that we've found on television.  Character models have also seen improvement with an increase in their polygon count, and the textures used for their faces are as close to the real thing as they've ever been. Pyrotechnics for wrestler intros look terrific (especially for the Goldberg and Triple H) and the 3D crowds make a huge difference when compared to last year.     But as we mentioned earlier, there are still quite a few clipping problems -- and this translates into the player grapples as well. So it's not uncommon to find one player's arm passing mysteriously through another player's chest. Other bizarre occurrences, like occasional animation stutter or a wonky camera angle can make for some pretty hilarious looking sights. The new blood and dynamic camera effects, however, look awesome. Sound Fans of the WWE will probably have mixed feelings on the audio presentation this year. Though it sports most of today's current wrestler themes (with the exception of Victoria, Rob Van Dam, and Kane), the legend characters don't have any of their music at all. Definitely one of the most identifiable aspects of the legends in the first place, it's a sore disappointment to play as The Old-School Undertaker or the Legion of Doom and not hear their trademark introductions.  Another big surprise this year is the lack of commentary and ring announcing. And while we don't miss this omission in the least (let's face it, it was damned awful), players who don't want to make up their own dialogue could be in for some silent times ahead. Another group who will probably be scratching their noggins, are the technophiles left wondering as to what happened to their Dolby Pro Logic support -- because this game doesn't have any.  Despite its somewhat behind the times approach in this department, Here Comes the Pain still manages to produce some pretty believable sound effects for the standard PS2 surround sound. The player themes that are accurate sound really good as well, and the different foley used for in the ring and outside of it were definitely appreciated (earlier builds had us worried that concrete would sound like the mat). Hearing the crowd chant our wrestler's name was awesome.To claim that THQ and Yukes have managed to turn the status of this series around is an understatement. Selling almost 5 million copies combined over its previous incarnations, Smackdown would have done well even if its developers had decided to do nothing but sit back and update its roster. Luckily for the game's fans, however, THQ actually listened to its consumers and went back to the drawing board to produce an effort sure to please the masses.Not without its own collection of issues that still need to be fixed for next time, WWE Smackdown! Here Comes the Pain is still one of the best wrestling games we've ever played. Though we personally feel at IGNPS2 that our Xbox colleagues rated their version of the WWE a little too highly, we'll go on record by saying that Smackdown kicks RAW 2's ass all over the parking lot -- regardless of its identical score.With its ultra-improved gameplay mechanics, enhanced visual engine, smarter career mode, and established create-a-character feature, Yukes and THQ are definitely the track to success. Not quite on the same level as the legendary Fire Pro or Giant Gram series just yet, Here Comes the Pain could mark a turning point for its franchise and signal the beginning of something great. Wrestling fans should love it.", "date": "Oct 24, 2003"}
