There's nothing that warms my heart more than sending some ten-year-old kid to the hospital with a spinal cord injury when I ram the little sucker head-on with my bumper car. And if he looks at me funny, I will hound him for the entire ride, smashing him until he screams for mercy or security needs to be called. Sad to say, I do not experience that sense of joy when playing Digital Chocolate's Bumper Car City game.   The goal of BCC is to claim citizenship in a town filled with nothing but bumper car drivers. All female bumper car drivers. I'm not sure if that's an unintended sexist slip by the programmers by telling us that women drivers are so bad they should be driving bumper cars or if the programmers just like women. I report. You decide.    You gain citizenship by gaining 50 votes. You start off on a small grid with 5 other drivers roaming the area. Your battery life slowly depletes so you have to try and do as many missions and get as many votes as possible before it drains. There are numerous missions to complete and you only have 20 seconds to get the most votes possible in that mission. Votes are given by the amount of happy faces you receive. Do bad, and you'll probably only get one happy face. A flawless run will net you five happy faces. Some of the missions range from picking up cones, to racing the other drivers, playing a game of bumper car tag, escaping the other drivers, or try to smash them all in the time allotted.    The problem isn't the game's concept, it's the execution. Controlling your car is frustrating, and you'll find yourself bumping into the walls over and over again. Left and right are the only controls you use. The car self-accelerates, and there's no way to slow down your momentum -- this stinks when your car has the turning radius of a cow. It also takes quite a bit of time just trying to find another driver to smash and get a mission icon, wasting time you don't have. The grid view itself is what's the most frustrating. The top down view needs to be pulled back so you have a better picture of where other drivers are at and is extremely frustrating once you start a mission.   After you hit the icon a driver drops, your mission starts. Problem is, a lot of times you're not sure what the mission is because the descriptions are so bad. I often got confused during the tag missions because one of them has you dumping off your star icon to another driver, and another mission has you trying to avoid them from dumping their icon off on to you. With such a limited view of the playing field, I had no way to plot an efficient course of action. I just had to pray that I was able to avoid one of them within a split second when they appeared on the screen. The racing mission was also frustrating because not only are you racing the other drivers, but the arrow indicating where you're to go, changes instantly. So will the computer knows the race layout, you don't, leaving you having to turn around because the arrow went from up to left faster than the speed of light. In the mission where you try and pick up all the cones, not only are you dealing with the clock, but also another driver constantly bumping you preventing you from picking them up. Even if you pick most of them up, because of the view, you have no idea where the other cones could be. By that time the twenty seconds is up. Also, right before the mission starts, you don't see your car so you have no idea which way you'll be facing. The game just feels like it wasn't finished.   Power-ups are littered throughout the playing field, such as a feather which gives you greater turning capability. Batteries extend your playing field time (not your mission time) and weights cause more damage. One power-up I found confusing was the magnet that pushes other cars away from you. Isn't this a bumper car game? The icon is useful for a couple of missions where you want to avoid the other drivers but is a real time-waster on the regular playing field when your goal is to try and smash other cars to start missions and get votes. I don't understand why they had to have missions to gather votes. Why not just go after other drivers, maybe fight some bumper car bosses or something? After gathering 46 out of 50 votes and not being able to get 5 happy faces on a couple of missions due to the controls and limited view, I was ready to give up. The city can keep its offer of citizenship, I'll move to another town.   Graphics are cute and friendly but the grid itself is very plain and boring. The music is very well done and you have the option of changing it by using the left soft key. Like I mention earlier, Bumper Car City is a great concept, but it wasn't well-executed. In the help screen that describes game play, it states ~By accepting these terms, the driver is aware that driving the bumper car can cause hilarious laughter which he or she might not be able to control.~ I think they can safely remove the can cause hilarious laughter part.", "date": "Dec 7, 2007"}
