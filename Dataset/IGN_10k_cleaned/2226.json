And since many of those kids grew up to become videogame junkies, it makes sense for the Lego license to pop up on game systems today.  I didn't know what to expect from Lego Bionicle.  Was it going to involve elements of piecing together Legos?  Would the environments be Lego-like?  Would it make me want to go out and drop some serious dime at the local Toys B Us on Legos?  No, no, and no.  Unfortunately, Lego Bionicle is an uninspired mess. Features More than 20 levels Integration with the Lego Bionicle toys Link cable support for up to four players (multi-cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  In Lego Bionicle you play the hero of the island Mata Nui which has lived under the shadow of darkness for some time.  Apparently it's come time to break free of the dark times and you are instructed to find the six Toa stones which will summon Mata Nui's ancient heroes.    Right off the bat, Lego Bionicle disappoints.  When you begin a new game you are taken to the ~Create Player~ screen.  If you're thinking you'll be able to choose different Lego pieces to make your own Bionicle creation, you're mistaken.  You're only allowed to change the color of the head, arms, and legs of your Bionicle (I made mine match the color of my GBA!).  Though the music is decent and the graphics are nice, the game feels slapped together.  There's no real directing force in your adventures and you may often wonder what you're supposed to do next.  The NPCs are bland and forgettable.  Some would actually tell me about a task I'd already accomplished.  The story is a mess.  It never builds and it's never compelling.    I will say that each of the six worlds is different and the creatures in those words are usually pretty cool.  One of my favorites is the Daikau Plant which acts like a venus flytrap, snatching unsuspecting passerbys.  While fighting your way through six different worlds, you'll be defeating most of your foes by chucking rocks at them.  Rocks.  The controls can get frustrating as you try to position yourself to properly conk a monster on the noggin.  For an odd touch, Saffire decided to let your defeated victims remain on the screen twitching as they cling to life.  Nothing says Lego like watching a monster spasm in agony after you've brained them with a rock.  After completing each world, a mini-game is unlocked.  You can link up with your buddies to play any of the six mini-games.  Most of these are actually a bit of fun, especially Ignalu Lava Surfing where you surf across lava and Koli Football which has absolutely nothing to do with football but is amusing nonetheless.  However, there are some mini-games that make absolutely no sense, like Ussal Crab Dig.  If you choose to view the instructions, a screen full of nonsensical symbols will be displayed.  You can find out the actual instructions in the game manual, but you shouldn't have to.  It's just another of the little things Saffire fails to deliver. I've had more fun watching my grandmother play bingo, and my grandmother is dead.  Lego Bionicle is just no fun.  It holds little challenge and offers few rewards.  The point of Legos is that it holds infinite combinations for your imagination to feast on, but there's no imagination here.  Even if you are a die-hard Legomaniac, you will likely be let down by this effort.", "date": "Nov 7, 2001"}
