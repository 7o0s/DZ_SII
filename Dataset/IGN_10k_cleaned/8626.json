Landing a fish is a contest of the wills between the angler that must seek out the catch and then use brute strength -- and some heavy line -- to raise the fish from the waters. Seriously, ask any hardcore fisherman that isn't just in it for the camaraderie and the beer, and they'll describe something so passionate and tangible that you want to experience it for yourself.   But not everybody can or wants to drop a bundle on a rod, tackle, and an ice chest full of cold ones. And even if you do, sometimes you find yourself sitting in a cubicle, not a boat. That's the audience EA Mobile is aiming for with ESPN Bassmaster Elite Series -- a little taste of the morning mist and the boat ride when you just can't be at the water. And while I confess that I am no expert fisherman, I really believe EA Mobile has something here that will please fishermen when they cannot engage in their favorite pastime.   ESPN Bassmaster sits you right in the boat, gives you access to a wide variety of gear, and four lakes to tame. You can try out different lure for different conditions, such as a crankbait for largemouth or buzzbait for making a stir on the surface. You can also look at using slower, heavier rods to reel in beefy largemouth or faster, lightweight rods for getting a fish into the boat before it gets away. Now, if you're well-versed in this stuff, you'll immediately know what to use and when to use it. However, if you're a newcomer to fishing or even an absolute rube, the game helpfully explains which lure is best to use. And it does this without making you feel stupid.   The game offers a smart tutorial that teaches you the basics of mobile fishing. After picking a fishing spot, you head out in your boat and look around the water for any shadowing that indicates a fish. You cast your line and then watch a meter at the bottom of the screen. The meter pulses when a fish takes a nibble. The bigger the pulse, the bigger the fish. Hit OK when the meter pops and you'll start to reel it in. To start the fight with the fish, you must play a small mini-game, keeping it within a circle by pressing 2, 4, 6, or 8. If the fish yanks too far outside the circle, the line breaks. Once the fish is good and tired, you must follow a series of arrows to finish reeling it in.   This mechanic is very simple to learn, which is great for the casual set. But as you start landing bigger catches, the fights get harder and more intense. You really have to jam on those number keys to tucker out the fish. But when you finally wrangle that first seventeen-pounder into the boat, there is a sense of accomplishment.   The majority of the game is spent in the tournament mode, which gives you three days to go out into the water and make the biggest catches you can before time's up. As you work your way up the ranks, you unlock additional lakes such as Castaic and Oneida. The lakes have different fishing spots, each with different fish and different environmental features, like weeds or logs. Each cast takes fifteen minutes of game time, so you cannot just go wild and throw out your line in hopes of quantity beating out quality. You must be smart about which fish you try to reel in so, at the end of each day in the tournament, you end up with the biggest haul.   I enjoyed the tournament mode once I really got a feel for how to go after the biggest fish. There are enough little nudges that you won't get frustrated early, but as you advance, you must start relying on acquired knowledge. Even though the game asks more of you, it doesn't beat you over the head like many simulations. This is good for engaging casual gamers who might otherwise be apprehensive about checking out a fishing game.   The presentation is solid. The game opens up with a shot inside the ESPN Bassmaster studio and continues using all the ESPN banners and logos throughout the remainder of the game. I checked out the website for the actual TV show and immediately saw the inspiration for the look of the game.  I do not like to go fishing, nor do I like to watch it on television -- even though I know some people love it, I liken it to watching paint dry. However, EA Mobile's ESPN Bassmaster pulls off the kind of coup I haven't seen since Sega Bass Fishing on the Dreamcast. By stripping away all the dull set-up and the esoteric rod and tackle knowledge and choosing to zero in strictly on the fight with the increasingly large fish, ESPN Bassmaster hooked me. It's easy to jump in and out of, and the mini-game mechanics tied to landing a fish are fun. But there is a degree of depth here that, if you are an avid angler, can be engaged. And by successfully working on two levels for two different audiences, I'm happy to give ESPN Bassmaster a big thumbs up.", "date": "Jun 12, 2007"}
