My brother and I were settled at my grandmother's house playing our newly purchased game machines and having the time of our lives. Me with my Genesis and him with his Super Nintendo, the two of us hogged the television set like 16-bit cannibals. I managed to acquire for myself a pretty impressive score that Christmas; Phantasy Star II,  Sword of Vermillion, and Sonic the Hedgehog were being popped in and out of my Genny like nobody's business. I also received a spanking new six-disc CD changer, so three games and those impressive pieces of hardware were the total sum of my loot and I was a happy camper.  My brother on the other hand was in a bit of a dilemma, as my mother and grandparents wanted our gift total to be on equal ground. Now I don't know if any of you remember this, but back in the days when the Super NES first hit there was quite a game shortage. Finding the title you were looking for was a serious pain in the cheeks and even more so during the holidays. My bro did manage to get three games himself (Super Mario World, Final Fight, and Ultraman) but that was it... no CD player for him and no other extra expensive goody to take its place. So my grandmother made him a deal: Sometime in the next few days she would take him to the store and buy him two more carts to go along with his current collection. It was a great idea and we talked about what he'd get for days afterward.  Flash forward to the next week. My brother's two new gamepaks found themselves gleaming like rubies in his grubby little hands. After much debate and a helluva lot of browsing, the classic futuristic racer F-Zero and the equally classic town builder Sim-City had arrived in the Dunham household (well actually we were at my grandparents home on my mother's side, but you know what I mean). After multiple sessions of F-Zero and quite a few excited laughs, my sibling gamer and I decided to give Sim-City the once over... We didn't let go of the controller for almost nine hours.  Previously exposed to only the Apple IIc version of Oregon Trail at school, we had been up to that point oblivious to the simulation genre. Alas, the only computer we had in my house was a blasted Tandy from Radio Shack, so our knowledge and experience of such games was as limited as our computers ability (you had to type over 200 lines of code into the damn thing just to play EGA Poker for Naka's sake!). Enthralled, intrigued, and completely surrounded by unadulterated fun, my brother and I were drawn into the little place known as ~Dunham Town~ more than we'd care to admit. A favorite of ours for literally years after we first unwrapped it's box, the quiet little game that could opened the door for us to future ~build an empire~ type games.  Later on games like Populous, Colonization, Sim City 2000, and Sid Meier's masterful Civilization were soon revealing themselves as mainstays on our itinerary. Another Sid Meier envisioned title, Railroad Tycoon had also nabbed our attention with it's god-like approach to building train tracks and stations. Unfortunately with the exception of seeing glimpses of the title on trips to the store or an occasional mention in trade magazines, our knowledge of Railroad Tycoon was sadly superficial. Perhaps we could try it another day...  Our setting materializes to the show at this year's E3 Expo 2000. Grown up now and having been to the show before, I was doing my usual stroll through the booths looking for something different when a monitor caught my eye. Tremor Entertainment's sequel to that curious game from all those years ago, Railroad Tycoon II was in the works for Dreamcast and already playable? ~Cool~, I thought. Now's my chance to see what this game is all about. Eagerly, I approached the booth and began to play.  I couldn't believe how disappointed I was. A glitchy interface and unfamiliar and unmarked icons left me guessing what to do. The tutorial hadn't seen the light of day yet, and placing track anywhere resulted in endless drag fests that sent iron and steel all over the screen. Graphically I was impressed with the backgrounds and buildings, but I still couldn't believe that this was the same game that heralded a ton of PC awards. True, it had received a ton of recognition as one of the best titles to be released for computer over the past few years and at the time I couldn't understand why... But Wow! What a difference three months can make.  An echo of the faulty demo I played at E3, Railroad Tycoon II is truly brilliant. The Interface I had such a problem with then, has now been completely fixed and finding the proper commands for what I want to do is just two button presses away. Building a track that had given me so much trouble at the show was now much easier to accomplish than before. I could even change any design idea on the fly with a quick movement to the cancel button. Navigation and location scouting wasn't even close to the jumpy framed mess I had previously been exposed too, and the visuals were tightened too. Needless to say, all my gripes were wiped away.  The premise of the game is a simple one; With a handful of financial backers supporting you, take your upstart railroad company and create with their money and your vision a powerful empire to provide transit and supply lines for all the world. More difficult to master than your average simulation game, the complexities found within are realistic and challenging while retaining an heir of fun. Not only do you have to make your choices wisely, but you also have to play the stock market to survive. Buying and selling stocks in your own company, issuing bonds, and forming hostile takeovers of your opponents are just as important as manufacturing engines and connecting towns.  The road to success has to start somewhere however, and doing so is an easy proposition. First you much choose two or more towns that you wish to connect and then carefully place your rail in an ideal location (watch for steep inclinations, they slow your train down). Once you've established a line, it's time to plant your stations at each city so that the trains have somewhere to load and unload. After you've built your stations, it's time to create a train and depending on the year and technology level of your area only certain engines can be made. Set up a distinct route and assign the appropriate cargo cars to meet each city's supply and demand, and you're off to the great race for supremacy!  While some of the more action oriented gamers out there may shudder at the thought of creating supply lines and passenger routes, the large number of possibilities in a single game alone is every bit as exciting as the latest shooter or beat-em-up. What if your train breaks down and blocks your access to Tokyo? What happens if that rival company begins to buy stock in your company, forcing you into an early retirement? What will you do if you can't meet a scenario's deadlines? What technology will be invented next and who's train will be the fastest? As you can tell by this small set of hypothetical situations here, every game can be different, and every game can never be as cut and dry as it first appears.  To add variety, Railroad Tycoon II has seen fit to include over 60 different types of engines. From the early chuggers to modern day bullet trains rest assured, there will ALWAYS be a different type of hauler at your disposal. There's also a huge list of cargo cars that can be added to your puller, with varying designs and colors that make identification easier than I expected. Move passengers, mail, coal, fuel... you name. You can even add luxury items like a caboose and a dining car. Don't be fooled though, finding a proper engine and cargo that's most effective for your scenario is part of the strategy (and the fun), so the large amount of trains boxcars are there for more than just eye candy.  Speaking of eye candy, how about it? Sharper and cleaner that the PlayStation port's horrid graphical performance, the game is sporting an all-new look thanks to a Dreamcast-exclusive three-dimensional engine. Built from the ground up, the improved 3D graphics allow you to view the board from high in the heavens and then zoom in real time to any location on the map for an extremely close gander at the surroundings. It's true that some of the landscapes may be kind of plain and other than a few mountains and an occasional tree there isn't much to look at. But that's they way they are in real life people! Don't blame Tremor, blame nature!  Another new addition to the Dreamcast version is the scenarios. As not only has every single last one of the PC game and its expansion pack's missions been included, but so too have a number of brand new challenges. With over 70 scenarios in all, getting bored on the same old map won't ever happen, as you can always move over to another one. An even cooler feature (and my personal favorite) is the sand box mode. With it you play any map you want without having to worry about finances or budgets. Build as many trains, tracks, and stations that you want in any configuration that you want! An idea playground, only your imagination's the limit.  The only chink in the armor that I can find is the lack of online play. Heralded as one of the first games to be ready for use with both Sega.net and direct modem-to-modem competitions, the inclusion of such a feature was scrapped with only a week to go before the game's final release. It's not a deterrent from the quality of the product as a whole, but I was hoping that I could give my brother a call and go head-to-head for awhile. Reliving old sim-memories will have to wait until next time I guess.  A pleasant and one of a kind experience for Dreamcast, Railroad Tycoon II is as fun as any you'll find in the genre. Big and complex with Grand Canyon-esque depth and a boatload of possibilities, this is one sleeping giant you may not want to pass up.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 4, 2000"}
