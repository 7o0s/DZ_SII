The original title proved to be one of the freshest, most charming little construction sets the console market had ever seen, and gave players the opportunity to plan, build, and ride the roller coasters of their dreams. Via a versatile, yet easily-learned interface, prospective coaster architects could easily kick out structurally impossible, 100-percent-deadly coaster creations, and upload them to the Internet for all to see. The building system had some technical limitations and a few quirks, but that didn't stop us from giving it a whopping score of 9.3 last October. And now, programmer, artist, and designer Hirofumi Hattori has kicked out an utterly fantastic sequel that manages to address all of the problems with the first game, while adding enough new goodies to keep coaster fanatics happy for months.  The original Jet Coaster played via a series of challenges, where the player had to create the most stomach-turning coasters with a limited number of parts. Your construction was graded based on the number of people who felt bad, got sick, or threw up (seriously!), and the game gave you an unlimited number of tries to create the penultimate speed machine. After beating the final challenge, you could build whatever the hell you felt like making, without having to worry about G-force constraints or the danger of your coaster derailing. Jet Coaster Dream 2 does things a bit differently. You're given a large field of grass in the middle of a city, and your goal is to build the ultimate theme park -- with an ass-kicking roller coaster in the center of it all, preferably. You have a limited budget and a pithy allocation of points, so it's best to start small. Using one of the slickest, most user-friendly construction kits in recent memory, you can lay down roads, set up rides, and freely place anything from ticket booths to Ferris Wheels. After you set up different attractions, the cash starts trickling in, and you can make improvements to your park.  The park-building interface is amazingly slick. Selecting, placing, and rotating items is easy as pie, and re-shaping the pieces of road is dead-simple (hint: hold down the X button and use the digital pad to change the shape). You have full control over the camera as you build, and you can jump through twelve different camera pre-sets for aerial, track-side, or first-person Quake style views. Fortunately, items like streetlamps, tables, and trees are extremely cheap to build, so you can absolutely pack your theme park full of detail. You can even change the time of day to evening or night, which reveals a new texture-set (though the coaster itself could be lit better). What constantly amazes me is how the game maintains 60fps, even with hundreds of objects on-screen at one time. Fantastic.  It's kinda like a super-simplified version of Bullfrog's Theme Park, where you have little control over pricing or other financial matters. The cooler your coaster, the more cash you take in; the denizens of the park will be happy to give you feedback if you ask 'em. While older guests may shrug off  your coaster, little children will giggle happily and proclaim ~Doki-doki shita~ (or ~I felt excited!~).  However, while building your park from the ground-up is incredibly fun, the process goes very slowly. It can take about an hour to reach the first ~Level Up!~ screen, where building constraints are removed and new attractions are unlocked. To be honest, I kinda cheated my way to the top -- I just left the default coaster as-is, let the park generate money, and kept the Dreamcast on overnight.  As for the coaster building itself, it's perfect. The screen is broken into four viewports, similar to Softimage, and the D-pad sets the angle and bank of the currently-selected track piece. Putting a coaster together is just as easy as before, but Jet Coaster Dream 2 allows you to interact with the rest of your park -- there are no collision constraints, so you can wind your coaster underneath the pirate ship ride (just like in Daytona 2), through tunnels, or over a patch of water (which creates a spectacular splash). Textured, moving rides are visible in the coaster editor for reference, and can be represented in wireframe to reduce the visual clutter.  Testing your coaster has also been simplified. In the original Jet Coaster, you had to finish a coaster and re-connect it to the station before you gave it a test-run. Now, you can run the beast whenever you want -- it just slows down and stops before reaching the last segment of track. Test runs also give you a good idea of where the most effective parts of the coaster are: transparent overlays tell you whenever a person feels bad or throws up, and if you view the ride from a third-person perspective, you'll occasionally see your riders get thrown from the coaster! (Don't worry -- this is encouraged.) And if you're not interested in creating a closed-track coaster, you can build a reversed, open line: the train is pulled up a hundred meters, and dropped to go through a course backwards, hit a ramp, and then go through the same track again in the opposite direction. Too cool!  Eventually, you'll wind up with one awesome-looking, ass-kicking coaster of doom, which winds its way through an awesome-looking, ass-kicking theme park of fun. Riding the coasters feels perfect, delivering stomach-displacing 200KPH drops at sixty frames per second, while blast through incredibly detailed park environments. Still, I wish there were less constraints in terms of building after you reach the tenth (and final) level -- creating enormous office buildings is especially expensive, and you're still limited by money and  the number of points you've accumulated. I'm waiting for someone to release a hacked VMU save with unlimited funding and points.  Jet Coaster Dream managed to achieve a cult following in Japan, and the active user-base took great pride in uploading their top creations to the official website. Hattori-san has been so good as to include around five hundred user-created coasters on the GD-ROM, accessible through the game's ~Free Ride~ mode. And some of them are incredible feats of virtual engineering  expect to spend some time riding all of the coasters in the collection.  As with the first game, the bigger your TV, the more fun you'll have (gamers with projection-screen TVs must have this game). Playing it on the 12-inch TV in your room is probably gonna be lame, but kicking it out through a five-foot Hitachi is unquestionably going to rock your boxers.  The bottom line? Jet Coaster Dream 2 is a fantastic construction set that creative-minded gamers will simply adore. While the road to the ultimate theme park is long and hard, it's all worth while once you gaze down upon your magnificent coaster creations. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it  if you love roller coasters, this is the ultimate import (yes, it works fine with the Gameshark, and there's a translation guide available at Gamefaqs.com (just click here). I suggest you take a look at some of the Quicktimes below, and if you start to get that doki-doki feeling like I did, then you take the cue and import this game now. After all, Six Flags ain't got nothin' on your imagination.  -- Colin Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 7, 2000"}
