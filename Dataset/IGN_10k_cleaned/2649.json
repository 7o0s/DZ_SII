{"name": "Tekken 4", "name_review": "Tekken 4 (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/06/tekken-4-import", "text": "Just a few weeks removed from Sega's convincing US debut with its flagship fighter, Virtua Fighter 4, the Japanese burn of sworn enemy Tekken 4 has hit Nippon markets and import stores like a hammer. Clamoring like packs of hungry wolves, Tekken fans have been snatching up copies in its first few days of release like nobody's business. An old-time Tekken Master myself, I've eagerly been awaiting its arrival in our offices for weeks and I jumped at the opportunity to play it before anyone when it soared into our office via Fed Ex. Hurriedly slashing the shrink-wrap like an overzealous kid in a candy store, I fired our Japanese unit up in excited anticipation...Catching my eye from the get-go is the brand new intro movie. A redone version of what we saw in the arcades, the whole return of the Kazuya thing has been expanded with inter-cut shots of the other classic Tekken fighters. Beautiful animation and super-clean models only begin to describe how nice this CG really looks. For example, Steve Fox's sparring session with an unfortunate opponent is brought to life in convincing fashion, as he pounds the opponent with solidly connecting and bruising uppercuts. Also, never before have I seen a woman look so real and authentically sexy as Christina (mental note to self: buy  fiance cut-off jeans and cleavage-barring glitter top this weekend). Once past the kick-ass intro I moved on to the mode screen, of which there are many. The first is a story battle that takes you through the adventures of each combatant more so than in the previous installments. Basically a deeper version of the coin-op, every character (immediate or hidden) has his or her very own epilogue and unbelievably well-crafted ending cinema. Forget about the 20-second epilogues of yesteryear, the Tekken 4 solution to every adventure can be multiple minutes in length. Be prepared though, a lot of the text and vocals are in Japanese so unless you have a strong understanding of the language, you may not understand what's going on.  Next is the standard arcade mode, an identical replica of what we've been playing in our favorite movie theaters for the past six months. Non-Japanese speaking players will have a much easier time in this arena as not a single on-screen display breaks the English tradition, and playing through is just like the American arcade unit. ~Arcade~ is an excellent choice for gamers who play alone and just want to whomp on some CPU tush. Other standard features like Versus (where most of us will be spending our time), Survival (see how far you can make it against an endless stream of opponents before you get beat down), Practice (Beat up on a stupid computer dummy), and Training (a mixture of the aforementioned Practice and Virtua Fighter 4's command training option) will give you plenty of goodies to mess with as well. There's even a Team Battle mode that takes a cue from titles like King of Fighters and Capcom vs. SNK that enables you to assemble a posse of up to eight fighters in a ~best-of~ contest. Sadly, there isn't a tag option to mirror last year's Tournament helping. Unfortunate. One of the coolest features this side of fighting games, however, has to be Tekken Force mode. Much more difficult that the thinner afterthought version from Tekken 3, Tekken Force can pits players against 10 guys through four stages of hell. Similar to a smaller-scope State of Emergency, the hectic action game takes a little getting used to, as the camera directions don't always match your character's directions. The small learning curve is the least of your problems though, especially considering the insane difficulty of the latter ~Force~ stages. Blazing through your hero in heavy butt-ripping groups of doom, the tougher-than-tough hooligans will give you more than a run for your money.    Visually, Tekken 4 doesn't look too much different than its arcade counterpart unless you have a high definition television. The first game to support true progressive scan, T4 on one of the high-end monitors is a beauty. But even if you don't have a heavy-duty eye pleaser, the fourth Iron Fist Tournament is still a sight to behold. While the character models aren't too much of an improvement over Tekken Tag's (if any at all), the stage design and look is much improved. All of the characters sport new outfits, and just like in Tekken Tag Tournament, each character displays his or her standard outfit plus one bonus one. A few characters sport a third costume, such as Lee and Xiaoyu. Old man Heihachi looked rather entertaining, with a sumo mawashi that's just a little too revealing. And in classic Namco style, each outfit ranges from wild '70s disco clothes to a variance of past trends. The special effects gave us a quite a chill, too. Whether it's the fabulous pool of water in the jungle and mall arenas, or the smashing helicopter simulation streaking through the night skies in the building level, Namco's flagship fighter looks awesome. We did manage to find a few little graphic quandaries, mostly by way of clipping. And yes, just like the Japanese version of Tag Tournament before it, the jaggies are here in multiple forms (but not as prolific). Small nagging aside, everything from the shadows to the animated backgrounds and realistic lighting effects are seriously majestic. What everyone would really like to know, however, is how well the game plays. And just as expected the familiar fighting engine of years past is still just as responsive and clean as ever. Smoother than Tekken Tag, the fourth game is probably the easiest to manipulate in the series to date. Want King to go from hop kick to juggle to finisher? No problem! The Dual Shock 2 seems to be made for Tekken 4 and pulling off even the most complicated of strings will keep your thumbs in shape and unscarred. Not to say that you can do hundreds of commands with some sort of skill involved. With slightly different timing than its predecessor, Tekken 4 is familiar and different all at the same time. Utilizing a plethora of the previous games moves and techniques, the change in timing, minute animation swaps, and added arsenal can keep even the most hardened Tekken fan playing and practicing for hours on end. While many of the returning characters have received extra moves and animations to flesh out their arsenal of attacks, Jin has been completely changed. He retains about three to four moves from Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag, and features about 40 new moves, remaking him into a entirely different fighter. His fighting style is now wholly original and spending time with him now is going to be excellent fun. One of the most welcome differences has to be the ability to trap your opponent against barriers and walls using the stage around you as part of a master plan. Players who fear the cheap factor can take heart, as the ability to reverse your position via left-throw can quickly move you out from the corner and reassert your position to a chance at victory. The characters themselves appear to be more appropriately balanced as well, and countering and reversals are easier than before. All in all, it's an old engine with a fresh face. So is it better than Virtua Fighter 4 you ask? That's a debate that's been raging for years, and one that certainly has yet to be settled. Aimed at the more adrenaline-charged offense-heavy fighting fans out there, Tekken 4 isn't really comparable to the defensive, technique-inspired glory that is Virtua Fighter. A top three contender for fighting game of the year without question, Tekken 4 is an excellent pick up for everyone regardless of Japanese translation skill. What really gets us excited more than anything though is how well it's going to translate to America. With the first PS2 Tekken title vastly cleaned up for the states in comparison to its Nihongo brother, it's scary to think that this one can get any better.", "date": "May 6, 2002"}
