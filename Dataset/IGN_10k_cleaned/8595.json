Beyond just being a port of a very popular Xbox game, the new PC version of Halo 2 also happens to be one of the launch titles for Microsoft's new Vista platform and its new Games for Windows Live! features. For gamers who missed Halo 2 when it came around on the Xbox, the experience of playing the PC version will be rewarding but more than a little dated. For gamers who already blasted their way through the Master Chief's second adventure, Halo 2 for the PC is a very tough sell.  The game really doesn't offer many surprises to those who already played it on the console. There's no new content and very few graphical improvements. But if the last time you saw Master Chief was as he was driving down that ridiculously long hall in the first Halo, then you're in for a treat. There's a new dual wield system for the weapons now, new opportunities to steal enemy vehicles, more interesting and varied locations and even a few other surprises in store. Better still, the pacing has improved and there are no incredibly long backtracking sections.   We were skeptical that the keyboard controls could approach the ease of use of the original gamepad configuration. Happily, the developers have done a very good job of laying out the keyboard controls in a way that makes sense. It's still a little tricky moving and looking while also executing a melee attack but, overall, the mouse and keyboard controls are intuitive and in some ways actually preferable to the gamepad.  The dual wield system is a wonderful addition to the game. Being able to pick up and use two one-handed weapons at once allows for much more mayhem in each level. Picking up, switching, firing, and reloading dual weapons is just as easy as it can be which leaves the player free to consider just how best to use the weapons he or she has equipped. This system is nicely balanced by restricting the player only to one-handed weapons (a carbine and a shotgun would just be too much) and keeping them from being able to toss grenades. Whatever the limitations are, being able to charge into battle armed with two weapons is hugely exciting.  Many of the weapons have been tweaked a bit. The original game's main rifle has been basically split in two. The new SMG gives you that same volume of fire while the new assault rifle focuses on high damage hits. Having two such varied yet equally effective weapons gives players a great sense of choice as they progress through the game. The new alien weapons are, in some cases, even more effective. The carbine and energy sword are two particular favorites but there are others that, used appropriately, are just as effective.   We're also big fans of the new vehicle hijacking system. In the previous game all you could do when facing a reckless alien driver was to blow up whatever vehicle they happened to be in. Now if you get close enough you can actually jump onto their craft and toss them out on their heads. You can even plant grenades on some of the larger vehicles before hoping off yourself. This new trick is a real blast, particularly when you can then use the same vehicle to run over its previous driver. A new physics system and an new incremental damage model makes vehicle combat even more exciting.  The AI in Halo 2 exhibits real behavior, both on the friendly and enemy sides. Sure, you'll still have folks driving Warthogs repeatedly into huge walls, but for the most part, the folks in Halo 2 act in a way that's believable and tactically challenging. Enemies seem not to want to get shot so they'll make effective use of the abundant cover. Fire off a shot as you enter a room full of unsuspecting enemies and they'll all immediately run for cover. Well, the weak ones at least. The really tough guys will turn and start shooting the crap out of you.  Enemies also seem to know when it's advantageous to attack in groups, to circle around your flank or to charge straight ahead and hope for the best.   As in most games, the real challenge is found online. Designed, like Shadowrun, to take full advantage of the new Games for Windows Live service, Halo 2 has a lot to offer in the multiplayer arena. The maps and player limits have been kept down at the levels they were at when the game was released. Gamers looking for Battlefield style matches won't find them here. What they will find are intelligently designed maps that offers lots of tactical excitement for small numbers of players. The wide variety of game types and abundance of maps will ensure that the experience stays fresh for some time to come.      The Live functionality is a great step in the right direction for Microsoft. We've been saying for years that online games need more consistency and more options for interacting with other players outside of the game world. (Longtime readers who remember the news posts, board threads and email chains it took just to get a game of Tribes or Battlefield 1942 going can surely sympathize.)  The game browser, party matching system and voice over IP feature are definitely overdue in the world of PC gaming, but there's some disagreement as to whether or not it's worth actually paying to have access to some of those features under Microsoft's two subscription plans. On the one hand, some games have been giving that stuff away for free (or nearly). On the other hand, Microsoft's attempt to build some consistency and reliability across the PC catalog deserves our support. The fifty-dollar-per-year Gold membership would be easier to swallow, of course, if you weren't already being asked to pay fifty bucks for the game and another hundred-and-fifty for Vista.   It can be a real trick finding the right balance between a playable framerate and a good visual image. We tried the game on a number of computers including one that sat squarely between the minimum and recommended specs. Even with the details turned down, the framerate was too low to really lose yourself in the action. Our recommendation is that you stay clear of the game until your PC exceeds the recommended requirements. The real disappointment is that, even on our new super computers that run the game at a ridiculously high resolution with little slowdown, the game still looks like a three-year-old console game. Even at its best, it suffers in comparison to the visuals in more recent, top-tier PC shooters.  The good news is that Halo still gets by on style. The characters are all inventive and generally believable and the environments range between cramped and eerily lit sci-fi style hallways and truly stunning outdoor vistas. We still feel that the rooms you'll be fighting through have no apparent purpose behind them (Where do the aliens eat? Where do they go to the toilet? Oh, look! Another completely superfluous conveyor belt!) but they do make interesting spaces to fight in. Even if the rooms seem to have no real reason for existing, the architecture is appealing. Things can sometimes get a bit monochromatic and overly symmetrical from time to time but, for the most part, the levels are inventive and unique.  Among the various cutscenes in the game, there are some really dramatic moments and, even if the camera sometimes gets too close for the game to look pretty, the whole affair is staged nicely. Personally, we didn't find ourselves getting too wrapped up in the details of the story. If all a cutscene ever told you was ~Kill every single thing you see,~ it would be sufficient to get the player through to the end of the game. Technically, when we say ~end~ what we mean is ~middle.~ Halo 2 has an ending that ties everything up just about as well as The Empire Strikes Back so you shouldn't play this game if you're not also planning on playing the inevitable sequel. It's good marketing for Microsoft but we're likely to stop caring in the three to four years it might take before we see another Halo game on the PC.   The sound in Halo 2 is excellent. The music swells and shrinks at just the right moments to support the mood of the moment. There are games out there that have themes that are so effective that just hearing the first few bars can trigger an immediate and irresistible emotional response in you. Battlefield, Rainbow Six and Halo all belong to that category. To make things even better Halo 2 adds in thick and convincing weapon sounds and plenty of humorous dialogue that transforms the friendly and enemy soldiers of the game into believable beings.There are two kinds of gamers out there: those who played Halo 2 on the Xbox and those who haven't. For the first group, the actual value of this PC version is wholly dependent on their interest in the editor. While it's not enough for us to recommend it, gamers who are keen to create their own maps and game types will be rewarded by what the PC version of Halo 2 has to offer.For gamers who haven't played Halo 2 yet, the recommendation is a bit more positive, but still somewhat conditional. The pacing and art design have held up well over the years as have the multiplayer offerings. Sadly, the graphics just aren't that impressive any more. Worse yet, the performance issues will keep it from running as well as games that quite frankly look better.Gamers who have already upgraded to Vista will find that Halo 2's Live service offers some convenient and interesting multiplayer options. Gamers who are still on the fence about upgrading their OS aren't likely to be swayed by what Halo 2 has to offer.", "date": "Jun 6, 2007"}
