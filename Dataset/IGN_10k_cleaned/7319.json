It's a smart little idea. Like Katamari, you control a free-moving rolling creature that progresses across a simple landscape collecting ~totems.~ Each totem you collect adds a musical instrument to the soundtrack, building a full more rocking beat. The more you collect, the better the music and the more doors you open up to progress. Seems like a decent little concept in theory. Too bad it works so poorly you'll actually want your money back. Only it's free.    The control input for the game isn't based on the traditional controller. Instead you'll set the Vision camera up on your TV, aim it at yourself while standing or sitting, and use virtual paddles on the left and right sides of the screen to move ~Pterry the Pturtel~ across the primary colored landscape in the same way you would control a tank in say, Tokyo Wars. So, moving your hands up on the left side and down on the right side simultaneously means you'd turn right. Moving both hands up simultaneously means you move forward, and moving both downward simultaneously is the equivalent of stopping. At least in theory.   The most important aspect of this game is built upon simple mechanics -- the Vision Camera sees your movements, tracks them, and translates them into controls for the cute little rolling Pturtle. Sadly, this mechanic works with wretched inefficiency. Turning nearly always translates into over-turning. Collecting simple items on the little green islands turns out to be an obstacle course of drowning death. And just getting from point A to point B is neither fun, moderately fun, nor even close to fun.    The funniest thing about TotemBall is that it makes you realize how weak you are. You'll have to hold your hands up the entire time, padding the air violently to somehow manage going in a straight line, and as soon as someone walks by in the background, it could inadvertently re-direct you. The controls just barely work. After two minutes your arms will grow tired and you'll want to stop. It's actually a chore to play it. The extra sexy part, though, are the little rest stops place strategically along the way. Cute.    The game is simple enough to figure out in less than a few minutes, and thanks to the controls you'll find yourself playing for only a few minutes, too. Graphically, it's simplistic and bare-bones design. It looks like a high-res PS1 game with cut-and-paste graphics, icons, and fonts straight out of Zuma Deluxe. Sonically, you'll actually enjoy the happy little riffs and musical additions that each Totem brings, but getting there should be compelling, not off-putting.    If you happen to be a masochist, TotemBall offers more than simple platform gameplay. You can cooperatively juggle with another buddy, play pinball (which is actually kind of fun in a desperate kind of way), freely explore the game with no time limits and infinite lives in Freeplay, take on the Super Challenge (Super masochist Challenge, it should be called), in which you play the entire game with one life and a time limit in each level, or mix and match the game's musical totems in TotemJam.   TotemBall also isn't nearly as intuitive as the PlayStation 2's EyeToy, which tracks and translates movement far more accurately and quickly. Nor is the input smartly implemented. You'll have to use the controller in conjunction with your hands to make things happen. Created by Strange Flavour/Freeverse, TotemBall requires the Vision camera. It's a decent attempt at using the Vision camera and it's gracious to give it away free. But a game of this nature should have some of that Nintendo touch, you know? It should flow nicely and play easy in the beginning, and the control device shouldn't be as twitchy, inconsistent, and annoying as this is. So, I'd say we have yet to see what the Vision camera can do, and TotemBall is a very early, very crude first attempt.    My advice? Skip the download. It may be free, but like Admiral Ackbar says in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, ~It's a trap!~", "date": "Oct 6, 2006"}
