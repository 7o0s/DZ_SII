SEGA Mobile is also publishing Adios Amoebas, a slight, top-down shooter/puzzler starring a horde of rampaging blobs that must be undone by equal parts thinking and blasting.  Should you immunize your phone from this new threat?  Features: Top-down action puzzler ~Auto Save~ protects high scores and saved games  Adios Amoebas is a relatively simple little game, but yet it doesn't suffer for it, unlike Spot's other offering, Space Spyders.  Of course, Adios Amoebas actually has some good pacing and better action, which certainly helps its case -- considering that it really doesn't look all that much better.  You're zapped into a room-by-room universe where the only goal is to eliminate an army of advancing amoebas that only have eyes for you.  You have two ways of making these perilous parameciums perish: shooting them with your state-of-the-art bang-bang, or going all Pengo on them and smashing them between a rock and a hard place.  While hunting amoebas, collect tokens for points.  You can only hold nine shots, so use each one carefully.  (Oh, who are we kidding, you won't have much of a problem with running out of ammo--the rooms never become all that overwhelming unless you just fire willy-nilly.)  Each room is littered with extra ammo, so you have plenty of shots, should you decide to just use extreme force.  If you do manage to run dry, you can always use the rocks strewn about the room.  Push boulders against amoebas and squish them against a wall or another rock.  There are two different amoebas that must be bidded adios.  The green ones are none-too-bright, and usually just shamble about the room until you whack them with your gun or a rock.  The gold ones, though, can actually fire back at you, so keep that in mind when you want to get all clever and line up multiple kills.  Adios Amoebas is far from a complicated game, but it is entertaining, which is far more than you can expect from a great deal of the cellphone games floating around right now.  The action, while never furious, occasionally is frantic and should serve you well during those ten-minute dead times during your daily routine.Adios Amoebas is certainly not the best cellphone game out right now, but it is quite far from the worst.  It's just a few minutes of diversionary entertainment, which is really what cellphone games are striving for right now.  Lined up against the current crop, Adios is passable.  Perhaps you should enjoy it while your expectations allow.", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
