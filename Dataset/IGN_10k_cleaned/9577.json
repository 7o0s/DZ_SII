As a download for the short-lived SEGA Channel, sure, but it never got an actual release on a Genesis cartridge. And you didn't miss anything. Legend has it that SEGA thought the quality of the product was so low, that it would be worthless or, worse, damaging to even publish the game in the States. And whether or not that's actually true, the quality assessment at its heart is on target  because Golden Axe III is certainly the worst of its franchise trilogy.   It's more of the same. Which is a complaint first leveled against Golden Axe II, but is even worse of an observation here  by the third game in a series, you'd think at least some progress in design would have been made. Some evolution in gameplay or fun. But there isn't, here. Golden Axe III plays out in exactly the same way as its two immediate predecessors, placing you in the role of a medieval warrior who walks endlessly to the right side of the screen, hacking and slashing through repetitive bad guys over and over again.   But what's worse, III actually removes some of the small enhancements that were made in II  like the chargeable magic attacks. A problem with the very first Golden Axe was that when you used your screen-clearing magic attack, it automatically drained away all of the potions you had picked up along the way. Golden Axe II fixed that, by allowing you to select how many of the potions you wanted to use each time  you could use them all if you wanted, for a powerful assault, or you could spend just one at a time for a lesser attack.   More swords, more skeletons. Golden Axe III is more of the same.  But Golden Axe III is back to the archaic, no-choice system of the original, and once again you'll be frustrated by watching all of your collected vials disappear with even one touch of the magic button. This is supposed to be a sequel, a progression. Not a regression.   But it might cause some depression to realize, too, that other areas of the game have also stepped backwards instead of moving on  graphical presentation is another one. This game looks gritty, and ugly. Which would be fine, again, if it were an earlier release, but makes no sense here  this was one of the later games developed for the Genesis, and yet it made no advancements in either animation or environment design over its prequels. Characters are still stiff, their movements choppy. And the enemy designs begin to repeat themselves with re-colored palettes in only the first stage. It's a sad state of affairs.   There are a handful of positives to address about this one, though. It introduced branching level advancement, meaning that you didn't have to play through the same sequences of stages with every runthrough of the game. And it made a bit more modern the health bar, which became an actual bar that drained and filled instead of a set of health ~blocks~ as in previous games. And there are two new playable characters, in the form of a humanoid panther mutant man, and a gigantic, shackled brute that looks like he stepped out of the WWE.   ...it's just too bad that they kicked out the most unique and entertaining past character to make room. It seems like, for every positive feature Golden Axe III has, another negative is introduced to counterbalance it. And that's solidified by the fact that Gilius Thunderhead, the dwarf who wielded the golden axe in the series' original outing, isn't even playable this time around. He's pushed aside and made into window dressing, appearing on the character select screen and dispatching your chosen character at the beginning of the game, but little seen beyond then.It's just not surprising at all that the Golden Axe series faded out and died when it did, after witnessing the downsloping progression of its first three games here on the Virtual Console. The first title was memorable and fun in the arcades. Then it was made a bit less so by its watered down home console port, which is the version the VC got. Then its sequel offered a little innovation, but played pretty much the same  and this, the third title in the Genesis Golden Axe trilogy, dropped the ball even further. SEGA was right in its decision not to release this edition on cartridge back in the '90s, as it's not worth your time or effort. And certainly not worth 800 Wii Points. So stay well away, and, if you're still a fan of the franchise, pray that the upcoming revival for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is at least worthwhile.", "date": "Nov 20, 2007"}
