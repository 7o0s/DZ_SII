Now take out the cool music, the great control and, oh yeah, all of the fun.  What you've got left is Project Overkill and a lot of gore.  In Project Overkill, you control one of four characters in different missions on a remote world.  Your job is to generally make a nuisance of yourself by blowing everything up and killing everyone.  While this premise may have been fresh a year ago, it's now fairly run-of-the-mill.  The control is simple enough -- move around and shoot stuff.  The player uses the D-pad to control the character's movements and the four action buttons to control which direction the character is aiming.  This should mean the gameplay is like Robotron, where you can run in one direction and shoot in another.  In actuality, you shoot fairly close to the the direction in which you are running.  If you want to hit something, you just spray bullets at it.  Which is cool until you realise you have really limited ammo.  The graphics are good and, of course, the blood and guts are amusing for a while.  In fact, most of my enjoyment of the game was derived from blood splattering on a wall or trailing after me.  Such things become boring very quickly though, as does this game.  Project Overkill isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.  It's just not very good.  With so many similiar games available for the PlayStation, this one gets lost in the shuffle.", "date": "Jan 21, 1997"}
