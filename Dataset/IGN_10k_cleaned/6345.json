How could they put a unique spin on an entry into a standing room-only category? Yet after just a few minutes hovering over the smallest of screens, the value of this game becomes apparent. This isn't just a basic Texas Hold 'Em sim, it's a teaching tool that improves your skills as well as a fine poker simulator.   Secrets of Hold 'Em includes everything from a small bio of Lederer to charts that divide pre-flop hands into different groups and offer advice on the best strategy for each group. There's a cool glossary that explains terms you commonly hear when watching poker broadcasts -- and terms mis-used by poker players trying to sound clever. There are ~Pre-Flop Thoughts~ from Lederer and tips for what to do after the flop if you are still in.   The biggest lesson you walk away with from Secrets of Hold 'Em, in my opinion, is not to be discouraged by folding. It's not a sign of weakness or defeat. Going bust is the biggest sign of defeat. Raising yourself into a corner that you have to buy your way out of? That's weakness. But to identify a bad hand, especially when another player has already opened theirs? That's one of the smartest skills to have. Save your chips for a hand you have a chance of winning.   But Secrets of Hold 'Em isn't all text and charts. There are practice tournaments you can play in with other poker circuit celebs, like Annie Duke and Phil Gordon. You sit down with these players and run through a game of increasing blinds, knocking each other out not with bloody strikes, but slowly draining bank accounts through nuanced play. During these tutorial tourneys, you can access a ~hint~ feature that advises you on what to do. If you win these tournaments, you can play a head-to-head match against Lederer.   Thanks to an exhausting amount of tips and tricks from Mr. Lederer, the star of the game, I actually felt like my ability to judge hands was improving as I played. And just like real life, sometimes you have to take risks and not heed conventional wisdom and advice. Some of my biggest wins came from when I decided to raise anyway, even if Lederer's hint advised me to fold. I just had a good feeling about the hand.    Secrets of Hold 'Em has a great, clean display. Reading cards is as easy as reading the in-game text, of which there is plenty. The avatars for the celeb players are accurate, too. There is no sound in this game, which normally I would have a beef with, but I've sat at a few real world poker tables where I wished there was a mute button. Or a polo mallet.  If you are into poker, Secrets of Hold 'Em with Howard Lederer is a fantastic value. The game packs an incredible amount of useful information and strategy for becoming a smarter Taxes Hold 'Em player. Whether you are a novice (like me) or a weekend warrior player, this title has the potential to seriously up your game. Highly recommended even if you already have a poker game on your cellphone, as this is the perfect poker companion.", "date": "Nov 14, 2005"}
