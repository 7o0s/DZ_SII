The only title to come out was last year's Super Black Bass Fishing and it was definitely a throwback title. Star Fish has tried its hand again at bringing the fishing experience to the DS with Professional fisherman's Tour: Northern Hemisphere and, unfortunately, it's only a slightly better catch.   Fisherman's Tour is a fishing game, plain and simple. I don't think I really need to explain that concept. The fishing spots are all along the (you guessed it) Northern Hemisphere, in Europe and North America mostly, but there are even a few scenarios in Asia. I'm not sure what the sport fishing market is south of the Equator. I've never seen the Australian or Chilean Fishing Tournament on ESPN2, though I imagine it's probably at 3 a.m.   There are 30 scenarios to progress through. Only a couple are open initially, but completing each one opens a few more. The scenarios are broken up into three different icons: Scale, Fish and Bracket. The Scale challenges require the player to collect a specified weight in fish. The Fish icon has the players collecting a certain number of a specified fish. The Bracket scenario is a tournament that is ranked based on the weight of the three biggest fishes caught.    Initially Fisherman's Tour is a little confusing, since there is no tutorial. There is a help button that will explain what to do at given intervals, but it's up to the player to figure out when it switches messages. It's a clunky system, especially since the game can be played with two separate control schemes and there are numerous factors. Both control schemes are the same essential thing. The touch screen is used only to tap buttons. A simple tutorial level would have fixed any confusion and only would have taken a couple minutes. Players can be patient long enough to learn how to play the game. They have to be; it's a game about fishing, a sport that's all about patience.   According to the game, fishing makes you a hit with the ladies. Ironically, patience never seems to come into play with Fisherman's Tour. Each scenario is timed and lasts about 12-15 minutes. That's more than enough time to complete any of the challenges, however having a short time limit detracts from the whole fishing experience. Those 12 minutes are supposed to represent six hours. Catching three fish over six hours is a lot slower than catching three fish in 12 minutes. It's not that there's not enough time to complete the scenarios; it's that the whole feel of the sport goes out the window with a timer ticking down.   In fact, a lot of the real draws of fishing are missing from this game. The most obvious is that you don't get a huge fish at the end of the day. There's a reason people wake up before dawn and wade out into freezing water for hours. They get dinner at the end of it. At the very least there is the camaraderie with friends or the father-son bonding moments or whatever. Fisherman's Tour has none of these. I'm just sitting here, by myself, catching fish. The game tells me I did well, and then just moves me along to some other river somewhere. Even the tournaments, which have at least a dozen opponents, don't provide any sense of other people being present. There is a single card multiplayer mode that mimics the tournaments. While playing I can't see or interact with my opponent, so it's just as alienating as the single player tournament. The only difference is there's some sweet battle music instead of the lame ambient noise. It makes the game feel like an extreme fishing anime. It would be called Prince of Fishing.   The developers did manage to capture one major aspect about fishing: it's really boring. Fishing has got to be, hands down, the most boring sport in the world. Sure, the moment of snagging some huge salmon is exciting, but there were four hours before that where nothing happened. Fisherman's Tour speeds up the process, but doesn't manage to make it any more exciting.    The developers did a commendable job trying to make a realistic fishing experience. They included dozens of real world locations, lots of fish species and different types of bait. It has the right ingredients to be a good fishing game, but the production value is so weak that the   The fish are pretty realistic, though the water effects are pretty weak and the environments are pretty bland. However, it's sometimes hard to know what the things floating past the lure are. Is that a lily pad, sticks or a dead body? The sense of depth is a little wonky, as fish that are 10 feet away look like they're right next to the lure.   Likewise the fish AI is incredibly simple. Even after attempting to hook a bass and failing, the dumb fish goes right back to where he was. Sometimes the fish aren't even moving at all and will not even acknowledge there's a lure there. They just float lifelessly in the water for minutes at a time.This is a bad fishing game, but it's not the worst fishing game for the DS. The developers managed to take their already crappy title, tweak it some more, and release a sequel. It still sucks, but it doesn't suck quite as bad. The controls are pretty much the same, though the presentation has been improved upon slightly. It's still hard to tell what's going on and some of the fish are lifeless. If you're dying, and I literally mean dying to play a fishing game on the DS, go ahead and grab this. Otherwise, keep fishing.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
