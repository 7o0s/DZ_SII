Well, four-wheeled isn't exactly an appropriate descriptor anymore as the series' available vehicle list has been expanded greatly with the addition of MX bikes, buggies, rally cars and snowmobiles. With more race types, a much better technical presentation and bumps to pretty much every other aspect of the game, the series' second installment on the PSP is a great improvement over the first.   Being as it ties in not only to the game's visuals but handling and physics systems as well, we'll start with the technical aspects. ATV Offroad Fury Pro looks and performs leaps and bounds better than Blazin' Trails and actually approaches what you'll see on the PS2 from the series. The draw distance is damn good (though there's still pop-in now and then) and the game runs quite smoothly for the most part, though every once in a while you'll see a rare hitch in framerate. Foliage and bits of outdoorsy detail line the tracks, which themselves are rendered with smooth arcs and subtle undulations that keep Mother Nature looking young. Texture detail is pretty good, but, given the game's size and limited amount of RAM on the system, can be a little blurry at times. Still though, this is a great looking game.    Offroad Fury Pro's technical prowess goes hand-and-hand with its control system, and this too works quite well. Given the variety of vehicles that are available in the game, it's not too surprising that none are absolutely stellar, but most all of them handle rather nicely. Bikes turn on a dime and really give you a sense of how light they are, while ATVs feel a fair bit heavier but a little more stable. Rally cars and buggies are quite similar, both having tons of power and able to slide around turns with ease. The main difference between their performance is that rally cars are a fair bit quicker while the buggies feel lighter - other than that, they're basically the same. The weakest of the bunch are the trucks as they feel sort of ~flat~. There isn't a whole lot of character to their presence on the track, and compared to the rally cars and buggies they're actually boring to drive.   Track design is generally pretty decent, though for the most part there aren't really all that many memorable courses. There are plenty of jumps and pretty nice sections to navigate, but there isn't much to make them stand out on their own. There are a whole slew of tracks to choose from though, so that certainly helps ease the wound.    The computer AI is somewhat lively in its riding style, using the width of the entire track to navigate most of the races. They'll perform plenty of tricks and are just as susceptible to crashes as you are. Unfortunately, they're not all that aggressive, generally shying away from the inside of turns. This gives you a major advantage in that cutting a turn sharply can net you a second or so gain each time you do it. On the flip side, they're usually very well versed in track layout and seem quite good at knowing how hard or high to hit a jump. While you go through the growing pains of learning each of the game's numerous tracks, hitting jumps too short or long and winding up landing in a less than ideal manner, the computer will nail them most every time.    The game's main single-player mode revolves around a series of championships. For each race type, you'll find a different championship for each level of AI, vehicle class and so forth, resulting in rather massive amount of competitions that you can beat. Obviously, there's a lot of repetition in this sort of setup, but even going through each main championship once gives you plenty of time atop of or in a vehicle.   While there are lots of different competitions to jump into, aside from the one freestyle competition, they're simply a collection of races. There isn't an overarching story mode, changes in race rules or anything of this sort to mix things up. Some gamers will like this basic and straightforward setup while some may want something with a bit more substance.    The coolest part about the single-player championship setup is the sponsors that you can earn and promote. You're allowed to race for up to three sponsors at a time and each will reward you for how you perform, and in some cases penalize you. Some sponsors care about placement while some only care about trick point totals. Most every sponsor works on a risk/reward system. For example, a sponsor may give you 500 credits for finishing first in a race, but dock you 1,000 for finishing last. This is the catch that may prevent you from always running with three employers, which makes it a pretty cool system.   Speaking of credits, ATV Offroad Fury Pro's scoring system is a little unbalanced. Credits allow you to purchase new vehicles, upgrades and so forth, and you can earn them by winning races and driving well. You'll earn bonus credits for performing stunts during each race, which is cool. The problem here is that it's extremely easy to earn a lot of points in the car-based vehicles, to the point that you'll get three or four times as many as you would performing stunts on an ATV or MX bike. Simply sliding around a corner or taking a jump racks up a lot of stunt points, so you almost needn't try to earn them. This means that it's far better to start out your career in buggies, trucks or rally cars and earn a bucket-full of cash before moving on to the ATVs and bikes, whereby you'll be able to max them out instantly.   The track creator is pretty decent, but most of your created tracks will likely feel somewhat stagnant as you're working with somewhat limiting pieces. There are more options this time around, and you're able to trade tracks with ATV Offroad Fury 4 on the PS2, but you'll soon feel hindered by the options you possess. Until you're able to freely edit the height and layout of the courses, this will likely be the case for every release, unfortunately.    ATV Offroad Fury Pro supports up to four players via both Ad-Hoc and Infrastructure play. Racing live opponents is almost always more fun than racing the computer, so being able to play online is a big plus. The mini-games this time out are better than before, so that helps extend the game's lasting appeal as well. We wish there were more, but maybe next time.ATV Offroad Fury Pro is a nice upgrade from the series' first outing on the PSP, Blazin' Trails. For the most part, the vehicle variance is good and there are plenty to choose from. Track design is good if not very memorable, and the upgrade system is nice. However, the AI isn't perfect and the single-player career is simply a strung-together series of races. Again, that may appeal to you and it may not. The bottom line is that if you're a racing fan looking for yet another fine release in the genre on the system, pick this one up.", "date": "Oct 26, 2006"}
