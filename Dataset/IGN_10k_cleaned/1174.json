There's nothing to be ashamed of.  We played with Lego's, and boy, did we have fun!  Back in the olden days, all we had were the multi-colored basic sets.  Nowadays, kids are spoiled with fancy ~Star Wars~ Lego's and ~underwater adventure~ Lego's.  Bah.  Instead of using their own imaginations, which is what Lego's were all about in the first place, kids have movie licenses and special edition Lego sets to do it for them.  That's today's youth for you.   The massive popularity surrounding the ~Lego~ name has sparked not only more and more playsets and add-ons, but plenty of software as well.  LEGO Rock Raiders, based off of last year's PC game, is one of these pieces of software.  Rock Raiders takes the fun toys that the world knows well and plots them underground in dangerous territory.  With a couple ideas borrowed from Blast Corps (on Nintendo 64), this unique action game works out better than one may think.  Kids will have a great time.   Gameplay Your Lego team is searching an alien planet for ~energy crystals~.  Since your ship's been damaged by hurling rocks in outer space, it requires a recharge to resume its running condition.  Inside the planet, you control 5 different team members through 18 stages.  During your missions, you will be required to rescue trapped rock raiders, collect green energy crystals and red energy crystals, and make it to the teleporter safely.  However, there are plenty of ordeals in your way.  Slugs, spiders, rock monsters, lava, geysers, and other obstacles will bar you from success.   Each member you control has his or her own special ability.  Jet can pilot air vehicles faster than the others and is able to jump far.  Axle drives ground vehicles faster and can automatically repair any vehicle he is controlling.  Bandit goes faster in the ~Rapid Rider~ and takes no damage from water.  Doc has the ability to drain energy from rocks.  Finally, when Sparks picks up an item, he gets it in double.  Since each of the Raiders has specific attributes, some may be better to use than others in a given situation.   The game is broken up into three separate parts, each with six stages.  At the beginning of each layer of stages, only five areas are available.  In order to unlock the sixth playable stage, you have to collect a total of 15 points.  To do this, you will have to perform tasks on each mission.  The more you do the better the medal you receive at the level's end.  If you only accomplish the easy task for that stage, which is often to find the green energy crystals or save your trapped friends, you are rewarded with a bronze medal.  Bronze medals only give you 3 points.  If you finish the minimal requirement for the stage and find all of the red crystals, you receive a silver medal.  These are worth 4 points.  However, if you do what it takes to get a silver medal, but you do it in record time, you win a Gold Medal, which is worth 5 points.   Each stage has its own dangers.  Some are swarmed with enemies, some are surrounded by lava, and some have a combination of obstacles.  Each character, except for Bandit, takes damage from being in the water.  If you stay in for too long, you will quickly lose all of your energy.  In spite of that, water is tame when compared to lava.  One single touch will cause you to lose all of your life, and you'll have to restart the stage from the beginning.   A good way to avoid lava and water is through vehicles.  Almost every single stage has a vehicle of some sort, whether it is one that flies, one that speeds across water, or one that blasts through rock with a laser beam.  Sometimes, the only way to activate a vehicle is to build it.  In this case, you have to collect a certain amount of ore and use it on a Teleport Station.  Once you've used your ore, a vehicle (which will be necessary to complete the stage) will be made available for your perusal.   Your energy is likely to be depleted from enemy attacks wherever you go.  To counter this, there are shield recharges scattered among the stages.  To fight your enemies back, there are also weapons placed about.  The Pusher Beam, Freezer Beam, and Laser Beam will be your best bets to rid of or suppress your foes.  The Pusher Beam creates a forcefield which can damage some enemies, the Freezer Beam puts some creatures ( such as spiders) on ice, and the Laser Beam obliterates hard rock.  Dynamite will also blast through hard rock, but its fuse will break if you walk too far.   Drilling is what the Rock Raiders do best.  If it ever seems that you're stuck and there's nowhere to go, search for an area to drill through.  Among the normal patches of rock are strangely colored segments.  These may either be drilled or blasted into rubble.  Loose Rock will crumble easily with a simple drill.  Medium Rock takes about 10 to 15 seconds to crack.  Hard Rock is impossible to break apart unless you use the Laser Beam or Dynamite.  Some vehicles come equipped with drills or can bulldoze through rock, as long as it isn't too hard.  Knocking rock down is necessary to unveil trapped Rock Raiders, hidden crystals, and other goodies.   The one-player mode is presented very well.  At the end of many stages, you are shown a short video clip which tells the Rock Raiders' story, although without words.  The Lego folk can't speak very well, but they seem to communicate with each other just fine.  Their speech is made up of grunts, ~Mmm hmms~, and other gibberish.  It's better than ~Pika Pika~, though.  The video is very cute and unexpectedly good.  The developers spent time making both the actual game and the cutscenes enjoyable.   The two-player mode, on the other hand, could stand to undergo some treatment.  There are six stages that you and a buddy can play in:  ~There and Back Again~, ~Departure~, ~Building Bridges~, ~Heavy Weights~, ~Crystal Isles~, and ~Web of Fire~.  The part that disappoints me the most is that it's not split-screen.  Both players compete on one big screen, and if one person lags behind, the other can't go any further.  That doesn't make much sense, since the point of the two-player match isn't to kick each other's butts physically, but to race to the end.  That in itself is a bit of a flaw, in my eyes.  It would have been much more fun to use the game's guns to shoot at one another.   Another thing that bothers me about LEGO Rock Raiders is its long load times.  I'd never expect a game like this to test your patience as much as it does.  It's a good thing there's a ~puzzle~ to play while the levels are being loaded.  It's just a simple picture puzzle that you have to slide into place to finish, but it helps make the wait more bearable.  Everything else about the game is fun.  Although it's supposed to be for youngin's, it's enjoyable for any gamer, no matter the age.   Graphics Rock is absolutely everywhere.  Expect every stage to look similar to the last, because they're all covered with rocks, rocks, rocks.  The level designs, on the other hand, make each mission have its own distinct feel.  The fact that there's lots of rocks doesn't bog down the game at all.  In fact, Rock Raiders looks pretty good.  The levels themselves are made up of polygons, but the characters and baddies are sprites.  There are no above-the-top special effects in the actual game itself.   The vehicles are the most interesting things to look at.  They're big and unique;  what's not to love?  There are plenty of textures, and most of them are good.  The animation is nice and the frame rate never drops for a second.  Lighting effects are nonexistent.  The full-motion video, on the other hand, looks great.  I never expected interesting CG out of a Lego game.  It's not the stuff you'll see in a Squaresoft masterpiece, but it fits perfectly.   Sound This is your average stuff.  You can hear the pitter-patter of tiny, Lego feet when you walk.  There's common ~ploiks~ and ~bloops~ when you pick up an item.  Your jet-pack swooshes when you jump, and water splashes when you walk in it.  The music is pretty good.  It has a very soft electronica-esque feel, and it's right at home.  There's no speech, other than the gibberish during the FMVs.  Who knew playing with Lego's on your PlayStation could be fun?  Each one of the 18 missions has enough variety to keep people from growing bored.  Kids especially will find this one entertaining, because it brings their toys to life.  Drilling through tons of rock is cool, and using all of the vehicles is, too.  LEGO Rock Raiders' challenge is just right for young gamers.  Of all the levels, none was really taxing.  They aren't terribly difficult to finish, but they're fun enough to keep everyone busy until the end.  The two-player game definitely needs to be touched up.", "date": "Aug 17, 2000"}
