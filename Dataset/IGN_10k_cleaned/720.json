Still, that doesn't prevent other companies from trying to make a quick buck in the genre  case in point, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000. THQ has the lucrative EA Sports license for Game Boy games, but yet it didn't snag a decent developer to create the portable version of this familiar and popular golf series. This has to be the sloppiest playing game of links on the Game Boy, having nothing to offer but the name recognition. Features Three courses Six pros Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  In terms of options, Tiger Woods does have them. The game features three realworld courses: Summerlin, Scottsdale, and Sawgrass. The game features six real life pros: Tiger Woods, Craig Stadler, Tom Kite, Davis Love, Brad Faxon, and Lee Jansen. The game even has stroke play, skins play, and tournament mode.  What hurts the game is the interface  never have I had so much trouble figuring out how to aim a shot. You have to select a ~button~ in a dashboard-type interface, selecting a indistinguishable ~cursor~ icon. Once selected, you can move a cursor in the standard overhead view. Problem is, the screen is so letterboxed that moving just a hundred yards causes your character to scroll off-screen. So judging obstacles in your distance shot gets a little tricky  but then, it seems that the trees are simply cosmetic, since not once did I ever hit one during my play session with this game. Worse yet, it doesn't even seem to follow the single cardinal rule of golf  far shot goes first. In stroke, skins, tournament...it simply just goes to the next guy in line.  The game doesn't even feature a battery back-up to save your game in progress. Instead, a lengthy password is offered at the end of each hole. Problem is, the only thing this password records is the hole you're on and your score. If you happened to change your name in the options menu, that's not remembered.  The graphics are pretty bland, too  the entire game takes place in a diagonally positioned overhead view with very little detail to the courses. The only time the game switches from this mode is to show your golfer...from a side view. Now, the established way of playing video golf is behind your golfer, looking down at the course to see your approach. There's really no benefit watching your golfer's swing from a side view, other than to say, Ooh, neat. And even this is a bit out there, since the animation of your golfer is pretty darn clunky. This view is obviously a design cheat so the programmer and artist of the game didn't have to render the fairway from an accurate 3D perspective.  I really can't say anything good about this game, since Nintendo has already released the definitive golf game on the Game Boy Color. To spend money on this game would be like buying a set of Ping golfballs just to pitch them into the ocean. In other words...a huge waste of cash.", "date": "Feb 17, 2000"}
