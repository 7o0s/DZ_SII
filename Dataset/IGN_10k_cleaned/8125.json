Since the basic principle is the same (destroy everything without being destroyed), it was often quite rare to find a game that was able to perform, or aspire to be, outside the box. Unfortunately, SEGA's 1992 effort Bio-Hazard Battle didn't really offer any groundbreaking gameplay or revolutionary appeal. While it would not appear for another year and on another system entirely, R-Type III would demonstrate how a scrolling shooter is supposed to perform. SEGA would have to wait a little while before learning its lesson.   Hundreds of years after a devastating bio-war enveloped civilization on the planet Avaron, conditions are still slightly inhospitable, to say the least. Players choose from four different types of Bioships to pilot through the game's eight stages (the latter three only available on the harder difficulty levels) in an attempt to rid the world of hostile creatures.   The ships are all very similar except differ slightly in terms of speed and maneuverability. Each ship has a primary weapons system which can perform a rapid auto-fire, or can be charged and released after several seconds to unleash a powerful energy burst. There is also a secondary weapons system which can be moved around the ship by pressing the control bad opposite the desired direction. For example, if you wish to move the ship forward, the weapons will fire backwards. If you move the ship downward, the weapons will fire upward. This awkward control scheme can be confusing amidst a hectic battle with enemies swarming from all directions.    The secondary weapons can be upgraded by acquiring energy seeds that are released throughout each stage. There are Spin Lasers, which shoot a spinning twin laser beam, the Nova, a multi-directional burst of energy, and several others. Some of these are actually quite powerful and come in handy when there are over a dozen enemies on the screen at once. Unfortunately, none of the available weapon upgrades really add much depth to the rather shallow gameplay, or add any element of strategy.   There are varying degrees of difficulty available, but none of them really make the game challenging in a rewarding way. Most of the times that you'll likely find your ship destroyed are not when you're necessarily overwhelmed by the opposition, but when something sneaks up on you from behind or below. It's as if SEGA realized that the game was too easy, and made it so the only way to screw the player was by being cheap. The bosses aren't all that difficult, and getting through the game's eight stages won't take more than an hour or two.   The graphics are mediocre, with decent, layered backgrounds and no signs of slowdown. However, the SEGA Genesis is capable of far greater feats. The music is catchy and appropriate for the chaotic action, but hardly makes up for the game's other shortcomings.It isn't all that surprising that upon its initial release in 1992, the game saw very little in the way of wide attention or critical acclaim. The gameplay is rather generic and uninspired and doesn't offer anything new to the genre.  Even with a second player the game gets boring far too quickly. If you want a true side-scrolling shoot 'em up, go with old faithful: R Type III -- it's just as available and will last you far longer.", "date": "Feb 27, 2007"}
