Jack Nicholson plays an obsessive-compulsive romance novelist who at one point asks (naturally enough), 'What if this is as good as it gets?'  I'm not saying Madden 2000 brings its own silverware to restaurants, but there are better-looking football games out there this year, and there are other games that handle simming and league management more coherently, yet for a combo game--a game that tries to be both arcade good and coach-happy--this probably is as good as it gets.  A complete PC football game has two mutually incompatible objectives to fulfill. One the one hand, it's got to look good and play well, feeling like real football while being as easy to play and as entertaining as any console game. But at the same time, it should handle the stats, leagues, careers, franchises, trades, and management options that only a PC with a hard drive can provide. These diametrically opposed goals are very hard juggle, and no football game this year (or for the last several years) has even come close. But with Front Page and some other titles not even in the running anymore, this year's Madden does both jobs well enough to win, pretty much by default.  Like I said, as good as it gets.  First, the on the field stuff. When you boot up the game (and for once in my game-playing life, I had no technical problems whatsoever) your eye is drawn to the rich animations and gorgeous stadiums. The graphics in Madden NFL 2000 are great for playing arcade football, even though they're not all that different from last year's edition, and in fact have been surpassed by Microsoft's NFL Fever and the new Dreamcast football game. But they're still good enough to play a game with. Nor did I notice any difference between the Glide and Direct3D versions either--and you can't say that about NFL Fever, which treats my Voodoo 3 card as if it were the Black Plague.  So onwards, to the heart and soul of a football game: how it plays on the field. In last year's version, passing was difficult at best, and you were more likely to win the lottery than establish a solid running game. This time around, the sinners have repented and this is very fun game to play. Audibles are handled easily and you can even modify receivers' routes from the line of scrimmage, something I've not seen before.  More on the plus side: the penalties are fairly accurate, and the ability to have a defender ~pump up the volume~ for the home crowd is a nice touch. The instant replay mode is as sharp, powerful and as easy to use as ever, and stands out as one of the game's high points. If only everything else ran as well...  The kicking game could take a few lessons from the Dreamcast title, and the silly button combo required to pump fake will do nothing but lose you a few teeth. But overall, the game plays well on the field, better than last year, and looking at this year's current crop of football games--what's out and what's yet to come--this is, dare I say it again, as good as it gets.  Then there's the play-by-play commentary. Concerning last year's audio, I said, ~John Madden's comments are so few and far between that when he actually has something to say it comes as something of a surprise. Glad you could join us, John.~  Well, here we go again. Madden's booth-mate Pat Summerall drones out the play-by-play, while Madden inopportunely mouths pretty much the same inanities he did last year, at the same ~maddeningly~ infrequent rate.  Whenever I play this game--this year's, last year's, whatever--I have this picture of the broadcast booth in my mind: Pat Summerall is by the mike, bored to tears, sleepily describing my team's antics while doing a crossword puzzle. Madden meanwhile gets real antsy after the kickoff, wanders off for some chicken wings, then pops back in late in the second quarter, scaring the hell out of everyone by suddenly grabbing the mike and commentating randomly about tailgate parties around a mouthful of chicken. What is going on?  Then we come to all that team/league/franchise management stuff. This is where the game really falls apart, because it wants to be a traditional PC-stat-oriented football game, but at the same time dolls it up with a hideous MTV/Multimedia/art-school dropout interface forged by Lucifer. It's like visiting one of those ~Shockwave-enhanced~ websites that turn your screen blood red before crashing.  So yeah, I really took exception to this interface. Apparently the design team consists of three-armed monkeys adept at the simultaneous use of keyboard, mouse and gamepad. I must also assume that scrolling and clicking with several input devices presents no obstacle for these super-monkeys. I, however, can only launch a game by a dextrous repetition of a set series of gamepad and mouse inputs played out in the right order; moves as difficult to master as any in Soul Calibur.  Then we come to the ~Madden Challenge~. This could not have been designed by a game programmer or designer. This is the spawn of a marketing department run amok, a group frightened by Microsoft Sports' ruthless price war or NFL Blitz's feelgood gameplay.  Basically, as if Madden were some sort of sub-par fighting game, the idea is if you manage a certain number of sacks in a game or long passes or touchdowns or whatever grossly unrealistic statistical anomaly, you are granted ~Madden Points~; if you gain 2,000 ~Madden Points~ you can unlock ~secret teams~ and, no doubt, big-headed players. Why ask why.   Yet even if you have the patience to wade through the unusable interface long enough to manage your team, you'll only be further punished. This is not Front Page Sports: Football, it's not Football Mogul, it's not Front Office Football. It's just a bunch of rubbish--the computer GMs can't trade sanely, the amount of players on a team are wrong, the roster requirements are dictatorial, and the player, team, and league editors are so woefully inadequate, so cumbersome and time-consuming to use, that you will throw up your hands in disgust and say screw it, might as well just play exhibition games. After all, Front Page Sports: Football Pro did it right seven years ago, and compared to that highwater mark, this incomprehensible maze of scrollbars and bad AI makes as much sense as making a first-person shooter out of Alice in Wonderland.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Sep 14, 1999"}
