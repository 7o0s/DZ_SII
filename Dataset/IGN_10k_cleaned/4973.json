It isn't necessarily that publisher Superscape and developer 3DWG made a bad game; it's just that they made a rather underwhelming one. Which is a shame considering this is the kind of license made for a video game.   Features:   Play as humans, Aliens, and Predators  Multiple weapons  Power-ups   Alien Vs. Predator is a strict action game. There is so little thinking involved in this would-be fast paced thriller -- just a lot of running, shooting, and jumping. This trifecta would be more than satisfactory if the game play was solid and compelling. However, the game's pacing is off, the visuals are somewhat dull, and there is absolutely no soundtrack. And this is the kind of game that needs some sort of boom to get the job done. Sure, cold space is silent, but not an ancient pyramid frozen beneath the ice. The acoustics are too perfect.   The best thing about Alien Vs. Predator is 3DWG's decision to let you play as all three races seen in the movie: human, Alien, and Predator. Each race has its own movement and attack dynamics. Humans, who must roam the pyramid in search of their captured comrades are slow and take great damage -- but at least they can use guns. Predators are massive, lumbering brutes with wicked strength, but they are strictly limited to weaker weapons. Aliens' are able to walk walls, fall without receiving damage, and grow with each completed level. Needless to say, it's kinda cool to play as a Predator or an Alien.   So, in 3DWG's infinite wisdom, you are forced to first play five levels as a human, And it gets boring. Fast. For five levels you must walk around a very plain-looking pyramid, jumping from ledge to ledge, in search of your fallen friends. Walk up to their bodies to somehow free them. As soon as you collect all of your allies, it's off to the next level. Sure, you have some decent boom-boom, such as a rocket launcher, but it's just not much fun to use it as it makes the game too easy. Even your basic pistol can easily wipe out an Alien if you jam on the action button repeatedly.   Why? Because the AI-controlled enemies are tragically stupid. Okay, I'd be willing to fault humans for running around like blathering idiots, but I suspect (from watching the movies) that if a human sound and started shooting a pistol at an Alien, it would do more than run toward the gunfire.   When you play as an Alien and Predator, things get a little better. The Alien is fast and free, and it's fun to get the drop on silly humans. The Predator's goal in the game is to collect skulls, which is at least a decent challenge, as the Aliens are fast-moving quarry and it's much harder to land a decent hit with the Predator claw. Honestly, it seems like the game has some collision-detection issues, because as the Predator, it seemed like a few swipes didn't count, even though we could see it connect with our prey.   We were able to test Alien Vs. Predator on LG's new VX7000 phone. This handset is a beauty with a screen that can really show off some beautiful imagery. Unfortunately, there isn't much of that in Alien Vs. Predator. The game is disappointingly dull to look at. The pyramid is bland and dark. The character sprites are small, which results in less detail. Aliens and Predators are known quantities, and fans will likely be disappointed to see such ~blah~ representation of them.Alien Vs. Predator isn't necessarily a bad game -- it's just lackluster. There are so few licenses better suited for a vid. 3DWG's attempt to offer three types of game play -- human, Alien, Predator -- was a great decision, but so much of game itself works to undo that coolness. I understand that the humans are likely to be the least exciting to play with -- but forcing you to play with them first is off-putting. The absent soundtrack was also a disappointment, If you were big mark for the movie, this may be a decent way to spend a few bucks, but there are certainly better action games on the decks right now that truly deserve your download dollars.", "date": "Sep 11, 2004"}
