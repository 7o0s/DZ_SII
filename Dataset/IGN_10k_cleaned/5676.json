{"name": "Twisted Metal 3", "name_review": "Twisted Metal 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/13/twisted-metal-3", "text": "Developed by 989 Studios this time and not Singletrac, the developer of the first two, 989 has built upon the foundation that TM was formed  solid car destruction in single and multitple player modes. But is this third version the creme of the crop?  It must be said, there is more of everything. A total of 12 cars are playable, each with its own built-in weapons and specialties. They are: Firestarter (a '50s hot rod), Club Kid (a tiny little Honda), Axel (a giant, two-wheeled standup), Auger (a construction vehicle with a scary front-end drill), Warthog (your standard Hummer), Thumper (a purple low rider), Sweet Tooth (your favorite ice cream truck), Flower Power (a female-driven VW Bug) Grimm (a side-car motorcycle), Hammerhead (a grandma in a four-wheel monster truck), and Minion (six-wheeled tank), plus a bonus car.  The game has improved in many areas, particularly the graphics department. Textures are more detailed, better Gourard shading has been implemented, and smoke, fire, and explosion effects are bigger and better than before. A wide variety of levels are playable in either in deathmatch or tournament modes, with at least eight immediately playable ones (in deathmatch mode).   The phsyics model is slightly different as well, with more rounded walls enabling cars to reach new heights and fantastic jumps. The cars bump and grind, bounce and take damage with gritty determination to stay in one piece until they're the last ones standing. 989 calls the new physics model, ~TruPhysics.~  Twisted Metal supports both analog and dual shock compatibility, and is now a four-player game, with a multitap. To review this game I went back and played the old Twisted Metal games (1 and 2) first and then dug into Twisted Metal 3. I always liked the idea of car-combat, and though not the biggest fan of the Twisted Metal series, I enjoyed skidding around, blowing my friends up, and getting radical off jumps in multicar crashes. In short, the first one was fun, and presented a world of new possibilities. The gradual differences between the three are noticeable, with the second and third seeing upgrades in graphics and speed, alterations in control, and additions to vehicles, weapons, and areas. This game was difficult to write about because it so sorely lacked spark, guts, heart, and well, drive. We're not fans of ripping into games, especially ones that started off as well as this franchise. But it must be said that there is little reason to buy Twisted Metal 3 if you own the first or second. Why? Frankly, there is nothing terribly new, interesting, innovative, different, or creative that lifts this above the rank and file of the car-combat status quo. With the exception of the four-player combat and Rob Zombie's hard-rock soundtrack -- the two great things about the game -- Twisted Metal 3 is a middle-of-the-road game that unfortunately doesn't do anything more than the first two games. In fact, it's just plain old hat.After two games just like this, smart gamers who have played Rogue Trip, Vigilante 8, and two versions of Twisted Metal, are going to ask, why? Why more of the exact same? Especially after the Activision's pleasurable efforts, one would think that 989 would try valiantly to top its rival's efforts. But that's just not the case. Still, Twisted Metal 3 is fun, in a limited, already-been-there-and-done-that way. The old formula still works, and 989 didn't mess it up badly, it just slept walked through TM3.I realize that the preview of this game was very enthusiastic, and we were actually crazy about the game at first sight, but the more we dug into this one, the more we realized how little it's changed, and how, in some cases, it's worse than its predecessors. With such a strong franchise name, the lack of inspiration and creative zing in this game is appalling.", "date": "Nov 13, 1998"}
