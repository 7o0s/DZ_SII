The second in the series (which, by the way, is also on PlayStation) is one of those sequels that follows the ~more is better~ formula. With more missions, helicopters, polygons on screen at once, more co-op games, and co-pilots, Air Attack 2 is definitely more fun than the first one.   Air Attack is a simple, helicopter arcade game that essentially does everything it's supposed to do, and it does it well. The great enhancement that's even more bolstered in AA2 is the winch, which players use to carry objects, bowl objects, and collect power-ups. For those folks who loved the first game, and who are fans of the Strike series, the constant action, the funny, toy-based Army Men worlds, and even the silly CG and voice-overs will charm and engage you until you can't resist any longer. My biggest problem with the series is that its aims to be a good, simple arcade game, and nothing more.   Perhaps Air Attack will never amount to anything more than the simple little game it is now, but I sure wish it would. For instance, with full 3D movement, changing camera perspectives, a little more strategy, and more realistic physics, and then the big kicker, dropping the Army Men license, you have a killer helicopter game.   Gameplay  Air Attack 2 is clean shooter fun in either the single or two player modes. The single-player game is now bigger than before, and the missions are more varied. And for those folks who like co-pilots and the firepower they bring, Air Attack is there for you. The story is essentially the same as always -- Green vs. Tan, with the General Plastro using the portals to transport plastic from place to place to manufacture newer, more powerful weapons. Your job is to stop him, and destroy the Tan base, as usual. But this time there are more bad guys, more evil bad guys.   With Captain Blade, Bombshell, Woodstock, and Hardcore as your primary pilots, players also get the accompanying helicopters, the King Cobra, Chinook, Osprey, and the Apache. Each of the helicopters carries a unique set of weapons and sub-weapons. For instance, in King Cobra, the copter moves faster but takes damage faster, too. Whereas with the Chinook, its takes a serious pounding before it falls, but it's slightly slower and less maneuverable. The co-pilot choices are great, too. In the beginning, players don't have a co-pilot, but as they progress and the story unfolds, co-pilots become available, and their weapons make for a little more variety. Woodstock, for example, calls in special infantry to take out enemy bases and weaponry, while Hardcore uses multiple missiles to wipe out more than one unit at a time.   The neat thing about Air Attack is the extra use of the winch. With the winch comes an extra level of gameplay that enables players to interact more with their environments. Most of the time it's just snagging power-ups. But quite quickly, players need to use the winch for greater tasks. Players can pick up objects, from soda cans to rocks to horse shoes, and can bowl them toward enemy bases, vehicles, and infantry. The winch is powerful because it helps to save ammo, and by bowling over enemy targets, it can take out two to four at a time. 3DO also has players using it to pick up things such as walkie-talkies to collecting and retrieving essential items, such as fort pieces and body parts. In its larger capacity, the winch makes the game far more interesting than it ever was before.   The level variety is all pretty much standard stuff, with a few exceptions. From the standard kill-all-that-you-see missions to the ~Take-out-the-Tan-base missions,~ players won't be surprised much at all. However, funny little things continue to make the game worth playing even after the boredom sets in. For instance, in the fourth level, ~Toy-riffic,~ players must not only kill off everything in sight, but they must collect all of the pieces of a secret new toy-weapon, which 3DO calls an ~eggplant,~ but which is clearly Mr. Potatohead! That's right! Yea!   In another level you build a fort, and in my favorite level for any Air Attack game, mission 7, ~Under Construction,~ players must battle against the Tans to grab control of a toy dozer using randomly placed batteries. The way it works is that batteries power the dozer, and they are found only in tan or green bases. By dropping a battery on the dozer, it drives toward the green, i.e., your, base. The trick is that the Tans have helicopters that drop batteries, too. So, it's a full-on battle for control, and it's really Air Attack at its best.   Perhaps it's this level that's most like the co-op and two-player modes, and that's why I like it so much. The two-player levels enable players to battle it out in a few ways, with six games in all. The first four include Bug Hunt (kill all of the bugs for the win, Food Fight (collect all the different kinds of food first), Flag Nab-it (capture the flag), and Aerial Assault (shoot down the enemy as many times first). The two-player mode is good for the competitive type of gamer (what other kinds are there?) because it's extremely well balanced. It's basically a gun-down, but the human enemy is usually much smarter, dodgier, and faster than any AI copter. For those folks who want to play with their parents, girlfriends, or buddies, taking on all of the single-player missions (22 in all!) in co-op can be done, too. That's a nice little bonus.    Graphics  With Army Men games, graphics are never high on the priority list, and Army Men Air Attack 2 is only slightly an exception. Granted, it looks better than Air Attack on PlayStation, and it looks better than say, RC Revenge Pro. But despite the massive amounts of polygons, the newer, more generous collection of funny objects and kookier landscapes, Air Attacks' graphics are average at best. Compare them to the best PlayStation 2 games on the market like say, Z.O.E., Onimusha, or Star Wars Starfighter, and these graphics are just kids stuff.   To be fair, the game is polished and clean-looking. For what it is, the simple toy graphics and weird army men landscapes are at least interesting. There are few, if any, graphic hiccups, no seams, and the game runs at a burning 60 frames per second. Like I said before in the gameplay section, Air Attack 2 does what it set out to do, but it just aims for simplicity, not extravagance.   The CG is just plain weird. At times it slows down, and it's not incredibly pretty on its own. But what's entertaining about it is the glimpses at the over-the-top characters. They may not look that good, but in a way, you kind of want to hear what they're going to say, and half of the times, it's entertaining. The tans are especially funny to listen to and watch.   Sound  ~I'm about to saaaave your little greeeeen booty!~ says Woodstock, the Green side's Rasta co-pilot, in one of the funnier lines in the game. Air Attack 2's characters are actually quite engaging, in that their characters, total caricatures, are comic, silly, and even occasionally unpredictable. It's almost enough just to hear what they say to one another in each CG scene. Don't get me wrong here, the banter is about as engaging as average Saturday morning cartoons at best. The voices are at least right on the button.   As for the music, it really is background filler, army style. At least it's not as boringly redundant as it once was in the early Army Men days, but the themes here still run the gamut from military taps to empiric patriotic tunes. It certainly fits the bill, but the music isn't really the reason to buy this game. Air Attack 2 on the PS2 is very much like it is on the PS. It's prettier and smoother looking, and it's fast. The game itself is good, simple, arcade fun, and as far as helicopter games go on the PS2 -- let's face it, there are none -- it fills the gap nicely. The winch aspect of the game once again adds more layers of fun to the experience, and the co-op and the two-player modes are definitely enjoyable. My biggest complaints here are that level variety is good, but not great. There are occasion levels that are pleasureable, but just as soon as you get excited again, the next level is boring again. Frankly, I would love to see the series expand. I would love to see it grow into a more ambitious title, with more realism, greater level variety, and a little more sophisticated controls and physics. I don't know if 3DO will ever do it, but everyone who played Warhawk back in the early PlayStation days really wants it to return. Air Attack has essentially reached its peak, so why not?", "date": "Apr 5, 2001"}
