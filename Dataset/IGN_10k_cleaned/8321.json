Well if it does (or even if it doesn't), this may be the trivia game you've been looking for.  Austin Powers Operation: Trivia is a solid test of knowledge that will give your gray matter a workout as well as your diaphragm ... from laughing too much (the one you breathe with, not the, er, well never mind).  The premise behind the game is that Dr. Evil has captured Austin Powers and challenged him to a game of trivia focusing on pop culture from the 1960s through the 1990s.  Since they've both been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, they'll need your help to answer the questions from the past three decades, including a smattering of Austin Powers specific questions.  Your ultimate goal in the single player game is to answer enough questions to beat the $102,000,000 mark already set by your opponent.  To add to the difficulty and replayability of the game, the mark to beat will increase the more times you play.  Of course, in a two player game, you just have to outscore your human opponent.  You'll go through seven different question rounds, from one of four different categories:   Need the Info!: multiple choice questions that test your knowledge of famous events. Stop 'n' Go Go!: pick the four right answers out of seven possible choices that fit your topic.  You can stop after answering one right, or keep going for more money. Keep Away: a fast-paced rapid fire game.  Keep answers that fit your topic and pass answers that don't.  One example of the Keep Away round is ~Run DMC or Salt-N-Pepa song?~ Crazy Chain: always the last question round in any game.  You're given nine multiple choice questions in rapid fire succession, and the next question in the chain relates to the correct answer from the previous question.    As the game is from Berkeley Systems, it should come as no surprise that it's a lot like You Don't Know Jack (and I mean a lot).  Of course, there's certainly nothing wrong with this.  You Don't Know Jack was a great trivia game.  Unlike many games that claim to be funny, Austin Powers Operation: Trivia actually is.  Most of the one-liners got a lot of people chuckling around the office.  Even some of the topics themselves are funny, like the Keep Away round where you have to decide if certain answers are Clint Eastwood movies or condoms.  It sounds easy, but answers like Rough Rider, Magnum Force and Any Which Way But Loose challenge your mind as well as providing a few belly laughs in the process.  The sound in Operation: Trivia is where the game really shines.  While Berkeley Systems couldn't get Mike Myers to do the voices of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, Bay area comedian Colin Mahan does a pretty good job of imitating the two main characters from the movie as well as providing the voice of the announcer.  While his Austin Powers is a little bit off, he has Dr. Evil to a tee.  Even the soundtrack is worth listening to, and the 60s Go Go music really gets you into the feel of the game.  The only drawback to While Operation: Trivia is the lack of long-term replayability.  The game does contain hundreds of different questions, but I was running into repeats after only six or seven games.  Still, I only came across two or three repeats, and, as I mentioned before, the score to beat increases with frequent play, adding to the challenge.    Unlike many other games that sign on a big license and hope to ride off of the laurels of the name, Austin Powers Operation: Trivia proves that you can have a solid license as well as a solid game.  And with a price tag under $30, it's not a bad deal, either.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jun 2, 1999"}
