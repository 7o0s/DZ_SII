So many have been released for the PlayStation in the past year or so it's hard to keep up. Crystal Dynamics has entered the arena with Slam 'N' Jam, but unfortunately it isn't one of the stand out titles.  The game play itself is solid. The two-player game requires excellent timing and skill and is a challenge in itself. The biggest slight on Slam 'N' Jam, outside of its lackluster graphics, is the lack of real players. Aside from Kareem and Mike all of the other players are fictional. And while this may not seem such a big deal on paper, you can bet your bottom dollar that the games with real players are gonna go before Slam 'N' Jam.  It's still a fun two-player game, but the one-player game, with its lack of stats and real players, just doesn't hold up against some of the other titles available.
