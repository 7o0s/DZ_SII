This is the title hardcore quarter-pumping retro gamers with finely woven SNK flags have been clamoring for since PS2 launched in 2000.  Even though Metal Slug X shipped for PSOne in 2001 and Metal Slug 3 released on PS2 in Europe and Japan in 2003, this 4 & 5 combination deal is the first Slug for North American PlayStation 2 owners. And, well...yeah, we suppose it's one of the games we've been waiting for. One of 'em, anyway.  Metal Slug 4, you see, is a title widely regarded as the bastard stepson of a long revered series that happened to get a little promiscuous and careless one warm summer's eve. Its inclusion in this combo box should be thought of as a considerate nod to the Slug faithful rather than a real reason to go out and buy, buy, buy.   In fact, the one true justification for purchasing Metal Slug is if you're a stalwart fan of the series and have been for the last decade or so -- a fan who needs to be enveloped by the fifth iteration in this series, no less. Any other player, be he casual or avid, might feel a little stiffed by the rather lacking bonus features and the inconsiderate way previous Metal Slugs haven't been totally excluded from this compilation.  Last time we checked, the PlayStation 2 offered up the phenomenal storage capacity of today's modern digital versatile disc, otherwise known as DVD. This wondrous format is capable of compressing and storing upwards of four gigabytes of information onto a single piece of plastic. Now we're no mathematicians, but we're fairly confident Metal Slug 4 & 5 do not take up two gigabytes apiece.  In fact, this assertion must be true considering that for all intents and purposes the two games are exact recreations of the Neo-Geo originals that bore the same names. They seem to feature identical animations, pixel perfect characters, no slowdown, and even the carefully laid out old school beats and sound effects that made the originals so popular. Given that there has been no identifiable change made to these games, there should be no reason for so many fabulous DVD megabytes and gigabytes to go totally unused when they could have been lovingly filled with other Metal Slug goodness.   4 + 5 = 6.0  Assuming we can get past some executive's deliberate omission of previous Slug efforts to milk sales numbers by releasing future Slug packages (as well as possibly augmenting the eventual Metal Slug 3D with classic content), we'll have to consider the games and what they're worth.   Right now, Metal Slug 4 & 5 carries an MSRP of $40 new. In other words, you're paying $40 fort approximately one enjoyable half hour of Metal Slug 5, complete with the total pointlessness of an unlimited continue system. That also comes with the somewhat unsettling Metal Slug 4.  Before dishing out your bills, keep in mind that neither game is original, neither game has underwent any sort of tweaking or polishing, and the whole box comes with little the way of staying power. It's an investment we should not be asked to make, especially when there are three very easy ways this release could have been improved. They are Metal Slugs 1 - 3, of course.   As a standalone product Metal Slug 5 at least offers a bit shooter fans should be excited about. This classic 2D action game essentially epitomizes what made the genre so endearing in the first place. It features slick animation and colorful characters, exciting locales, challenging bosses and plenty of comedy. In this way Metal Slug feels like a violent, but lighthearted frolic back to an era we all remember too fondly for our own good. And while this trademarked brand of incredibly simplistic jumping and shooting still remains enjoyable, especially for shooting enthusiasts, it's impossible to deny that for fewer dollars we could be treated to more original content.  For instance, recent efforts like the incredibly enjoyable Alien Hominid, offer better graphics than Metal Slug, better sound, more diverse gameplay, a terrific sense of style and a ridiculously fun mini-game. If you want to compete for our dollars, you have to improve (if even just a little).  But then if you too are a content starved shooter fan, feel free to purchase this decidedly average old game you've likely already played for a system that can do so much better. Not having many games of a certain type is no excuse to applaud the few underdeveloped games of that type that do happen to occasionally release. This series could stand to be reworked and improved. This particular package could stand to be filled with some actual content worth paying $40 for. Still, the games beneath the box are what they should be. That is, when you purchase the Metal Slug 4 & 5 combination pack, you are purchasing Metal Slug 4 & 5, wrinkles and all. That's not a horrible thing, but it's also not a great thing.", "date": "May 27, 2005"}
