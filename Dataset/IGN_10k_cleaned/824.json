Spring training is nearly over, the teams are beginning to make their final cuts, and opening day is just about upon us. Baseball is America's past time and opening day for the Major League Baseball season is considered to be a religious event for many hard working Americans.   And with the start of any baseball season comes a new version of the vaunted Triple Play Series from the sports fanatics over at EA Sports. Year in and year out, the EA's Triple Play game is ballyhooed as the premiere baseball videogame on the PlayStation.   Gameplay At it's heart, the basic gameplay in TP2001 remains true to its series. Longtime fans of Triple Play will be able to easily get into the game without any problems. Players are given the typical set of options, such as the ability to play an entire 162 game season with full playoffs or a shorter seasons and playoffs. In an attempt to give the game more play value and to try and appeal to arcade fans, TP2001 also features lots of bonuses and special game play modes like a Home Run Derby.   TP2001 is also packed with the ability to create players, trade players, and sign free agents. While the player management does appear robust at first, it's actually quite limited. Firstly, trades are limited to an equal number of players on each side, thus if there's a big trade in the big leagues where a premier player on one team is traded for a group of medium tier players on another time, it can't be easily mimicked in TP2001. This might not be a big deal for everyone who's looking to buy a baseball videogame, but it's definitely a major problem for the diehard statistical whores out there.   Problems also lie in the realism of handling of the players, especially when dealing with the pitching staff. Players aren't given enough control over setting up the pitching staff. For one, if you wish to have a four-man rotation, you can't just go to the player management roster screens and set it up that way. It won't let you have less than five starting pitchers. You can change the pitcher before the game starts, but that's not really that efficient and other baseball games in the past -- as far back as the Genesis days and possibly even before that -- handled it better.   Furthermore, the notion of pitchers getting tired is only handled well during single games and doesn't really carry over throughout the season. I took the same starting pitcher and had him start for three consecutive games and didn't notice any difference in his pitching strength or stamina. This completely ignores a very important aspect of the strategy of baseball, as the player doesn't have to worry about properly managing his bullpen at all. You can basically use your closer every single day of the season and it won't effect him. And, it can't be something that's too hard to do because Hardball III on the Genesis handled this aspect of the sport very well.   Hitting is the most exciting part of baseball (chicks dig the long ball), so it's typically the most important part of any baseball videogame. TP2001 handles it fairly well. On the regular batting difficulty sitting, players are able to control whether they wish to hit a fly ball, line drive or grounder. With the advanced mode, players control where the batter swings via a moveable cursor. While the normal mode seems a bit cheesy and cheap, it's generally the way to go in TP2001 because the advanced mode is made more difficult than it needs to be because of its sketchy framerate.   As with the hitting, the baserunning in TP2001 is handled adequately. You simply have to press the directional pad towards the base and the player will run there. If you wish to have him return to the previous base, just press the triangle button and in the direction of the base. You can also control multiple baserunners at a time by using the controllers shoulder buttons. It's really easy to control the players on the base pads on the whole, but they sometimes don't perform their actions as fast you press the buttons. This is probably due to a combination of framerate problems and being in the middle of animations.   Pitching and fielding are probably the two most important things in professional baseball, but it's generally a facet of videogame baseball that's overlooked. EA Sports has made an attempt to try and change that a little in this year's edition of its baseball series by adding a fielder's perspective for playing defense. This puts the game player more into the action than ever before in the series and is a valiant effort by the developers to spice up fielding in the game. However, thanks to the good old framerate problems, it's not nearly as good as it could have been. Just as is the case with most baseball videogames, I found that the best way to play this game is with auto fielding turned on.   Chicks may dig the long ball, but it's pitching that wins the big games. In TP2001, most pitchers are equipped with a set of four pitches, while others are given less. For the most part, it's based on the pitcher's real life pitches, but there are many that aren't entirely accurate. Once the pitch is selected, the player can control the general direction of the pitch with the directional pad.   Overall, TP2001 is a solid playing baseball game that will probably be more appealing to arcade-type gamers rather than the simulation fan. It has a lot of features that simulation fans are looking for, but its problems in the player management, roster handling, and realism may turn off the diehards. As an arcade-style game, it has a lot of hidden extras and secrets that can be opened up that'll surely please the NBA Jam type of gamer.   Graphics The game's graphics are relatively unchanged from last year's version of the game, which isn't really a good thing. While the player models are good and there's a plethora of different pitching styles, batting stances, and celebratory animation, the game fails in the graphics department once again because of its sub par framerate. I don't know what the problem is, but EA Sports' only real major problem with its PlayStation sports games has been with the framerate in some of them. It's a big problem in TP2001 because it hampers the gameplay significantly.   Sound EA Sports has put together another high-quality effort in the audible quality in TP2001. Just as has been with the case with the previous titles in this series, the game includes authentic baseball sounds and crowd noises that help recreate the true drama of the sport. It also includes some nice little jazzy special effects that add a little spice to the game.   The game's play-by-play is solid, but it gets repetitive after a while. Of course, this is really the case with any sports videogame, especial ones that'll have you play through 162 game seasons. So, it's not really fair to knock the game because of that.  In the end, Triple Play 2001 stands as one of the best baseball games ever released on the PlayStation. The problem is, that there really hasn't been any great baseball games release on the system. Its bonuses and hidden secrets should please arcade lovers, but its realism isn't enough to please the truly hardcore baseball fan. Nonetheless, it might be the hardcore fan's only option on the PlayStation right now.", "date": "Mar 29, 2000"}
