While not the same game that Z-Axis produced for the PC, PlayStation and (soon) the N64, Crawfish designed a rendition that feels a hell of a lot like the original game, while adding elements that feels just right for the game.FeaturesMore than 100 levelsEnd bossesPower-ups13 alien speciesLink cable support for two player actionFor Game Boy and Game Boy ColorIt's still the familiar group of aliens, forming rows and columns and moving in unison like a cosmic ballet, marching across the screen until it reaches the end and then working its way downward. If the mob makes it to the bottom of the screen, you lose a life (in the original, the game ended, but it's a minor nitpick). You'll have to use your ship and move back and forth, avoiding their fire while blasting them until none remain. Then it's back at it again with a new, faster, more powerful group.This new edition adds a few updated features:Multiple ships. You have your choice of three ships, each with its own weapons, shield, and thrust rating. The weapon rating determines how fast the ship fires as well as how long a power-up lasts. The shield rating determines how many hits your ship can take right off the bat. The thrust rating determines how fast you can move left and right across the bottom of the screen.Power-ups. The UFO that moves across the top of the screen now serves a purpose  if you nail it, it will drop a powerup that will boost your shield or give you better firepower. Some of the weapon upgrades are very cool. The Bolt electrocutes the aliens one by one, and will nail a chain of aliens with one shot. The Bubble gun traps aliens in a bubble and sends them to the top of the screen  when the bubble pops, the alien will fall and take out any alien it lands on. Hit an alien with a Shuriken and it'll split into two parts, taking out any alien to the left and right. And the Cannon weapon will take out a whole column of aliens with one bullet.Different aliens fire different bullets. As you progress into the deeper levels of the game, you'll find that some aliens don't act the same. Some fire bullets you can't hit with your own. Some fire bullets that will split into two when they hit the ground or one of your bullets. The further the level, the harder they become and the more frequent they show up.Different formations. Unlike the original Space Invaders, this game features different formations of aliens instead of the same rectangular grouping. Some groups are square, others diamond shaped, some even have gaps in the middle. It's a minor tweak that adds a lot to the overall gameplay.Shields. Your ship comes equipped with shields  you can take hits as long as you have a shield in your inventory -- you're not restricted to the one-hit-and-you're-dead gameplay.New ~avoid~ technique New to the game: double tap right or left, and you'll slide quickly out of the way of an incoming bullet.Boss levels. Every 15 levels or so, you'll head to a unique level where you have to do battle with something other than a group of aliens. The first encounter is with a massive spaceship with huge guns  take out the guns and you win the level. The second is a meteor shower that turns the game into the Intellivision game Astro Smash.That's all the extras that are off the top of my head. The game has more than a hundred levels, and each time you defeat the boss level you head off to a new planet -- you start on Mercury and work your way back through the solar system. The payoff is this: make it through all 100 levels, and you can play an accurate port of the original Space Invaders arcade game that came out in the late 70s.The game does get monotonous after 30 or so levels, and that's why I can't give the game such a high rating (but I wouldn't dare mark a point off for misspelling ~shield~ in the ship select screen...). Thankfully there's  a password option to save your position after each boss...but the size of it is just unbelievable (you have to enter 14 alphanumeric characters to continue a game!). If you liked the original, you'll definitely like what you see here.  I do.", "date": "Nov 3, 1999"}
