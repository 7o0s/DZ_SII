Angel Studios made the first big step in that evolution by creating TransWorld Surf on Xbox. Next came last year's PlayStation 2 rendition, and it wasn't simply a port, either. The PS2 game improved on the Xbox version in many respects, with an exclusive locale, more multiplayer aspects, and, from a strict gameplay perspective, it was a better game. Now, the third and final version of Infogrames TransWorld Surf title has come to the GameCube, and this time it sports the Next Wave suffix indicating even more new features than the PS2 version.  The game is just as pretty as the PS2 title ever was, and in some ways is even slightly more graphically polished.  Most importantly, the game still rocks, in our humble opinion.  The Facts:   Pick your pro surfer and play through 11 different surf hot-spots, including the new GameCube-exclusive Antarctica area  Kick start your surfing career in mission-based levels, or tackle other modes such as Single Session, Free Surf, Multiplayer (Shark Tag is nice), and Tutorials  13 new hidden surfers to unlock  Requires 8 Memory Card blocks for saved data  For one to four players simultaneous  Gameplay Back when the first two versions were released, TransWorld Surf delivered the first true fully encompassing surf game to consoles. Now, GameCube surf fans have a slightly superior choice in Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer. But Transworld Surf still offers a powerful 3D engine, more specifically an excellent wave generation system, in which several kinds of waves offer various kinds of experiences. With a Tony Hawk style approach to surfing, Angel Studios' game enables players to paddle into the surf, catch waves, string together combos and earn high points for rewards, such as new cheats, new surf locations, competitions modes, and more.   Just as in the Xbox version, players can enter a Career mode, which spans 11 beaches (including the brand-new, GameCube exclusive Antarctica region), with two times of day to surf each break, as well as a competition mode, a Single Session (a single location session), Free Surf (no time limits, just goofing around), Multiplayer, and Turorials (which is a decent but not great mode for beginners). The Multiplayer mode is good fun for four players, and the addition of the Shark Tag game is great fun: a game of tag, in which players become a shark viewing the game from underwater. Sick, but good.   The Career mode is the crux of the game, mainly because it's filled with a wide variety of challenges, but it's especially important to play if you want to surf all 11 locations. By meeting goals throughout the game, players earn points (a total of 80), and with each new milestone, new locations are opened up. The beach locations highlight real world breaks famous throughout the world of surfers. They include Kirra Point, Fort Point, Tavarua, Hossegor, G-Land, Huntington, Pipeline, Witches Rock, Teahupoo, Todos Santos, and Antarctica. Each has its own distinct style and wave pattern; for instance, the Todos Santos, Mexico, level is filled with a large broad-walled wave that's excellent for cutbacks and barrels.   GameCube fans can now enjoy a constant 60 FPS while thrashing waves. Players can also get to grips with several surfers, including 13 new goofballs that are not found in the Xbox or PS2 versions. The roster features Rochelle Ballard, Shawn Barron, Taj Burrow, Jason Collins, Tim Curran, Shane Dorian, Christian Fletcher, Andy Irons, Taylor Knox, Cory Lopez, Dan Malloy, Fred Patacchia, and Chris Ward. Each has his or her own special move, which can be used when the trick meter is maxed out. The karma meter is kind of neat, too. Players earn good karma by not snaking waves and not hitting animals. If instead they do these things, they lose karma, which in turn decreases their point-earning ability and makes them more vulnerable to sharks in the water.  What's nice about Career mode is that players get to surf the same location at different times of the day, which not only visually affects the game, but also offers new challenges, meaning that each location is essentially two levels in itself. The challenges range from real world surf tricks, such as linking a certain amount of combos together, to more arcade-style goals, such as freeing dolphins, jumping gun boats, or clearing rocks or bunkers. Photographers will catch you pulling off special moves if you're in the right place in the right time, and by getting caught on film enough, a competition mode opens up for head-to-head (i.e. human head to computer head) gameplay. Win a competition and you earn newer, faster boards, which are critical to use in later levels.      The arcade-style goals are rather lame and simply downgrade the actual experience. A few of them are incredibly frustrating, such as jumping bunkers, while the majority are based on developing your skill as a surfer. These include goals such as earning certain amount of points, shooting the pier, getting a number of barrels, or pulling off special moves. The hardest and most frustrating goals in the game are the ones in which surfers are supposed to jump over moving objects. While these have been softened in comparison to the very first Xbox version, they're still back in this upgraded GameCube port.  Cameras, Controls and Changes TransWorld Surf is enormously fun because it's one of the first surfing games to deliver a smattering of things for the sport: a smart effective camera system, long tube rides, real beach breaks (though not necessarily the exact waves from that location), a good control system, and a radical sense of gameplay. Call it Tony Hawk on a surfboard if you must simplify things, but TransWorld Surf is the real thing, and anybody who wants to play a good surfing game needs to check this out.  The camera system follows the surfer using a third-person perspective so he or she can see in front of themselves. It's moderately high and never loses focus on the surfer. When getting barreled, the camera swoops under the lip of the wave and sets itself deep in the pit of the barrel, so players can see everything. This is a good camera system that never makes the player feel like he or she has lost control because of the camera itself.   The barrel rides, which were perhaps overly smooth and easy on the Xbox version, have been updated and grown more challenging on the Cube. Players can get barreled on any wave they want, but the wave actually sucks the surfer in when he gets too deep in the barrel, or pushes him out just like a real wave would. The added tension creates a dynamic that makes it more difficult to stay in a barrel longer. Added to the new version is an extra point reward for what's called a deep barrel: The deeper surfers go, the more points scored. You won't find a better barrel ride anywhere.   What needed the most work on the Xbox version -- which is addressed in the PS2 and Cube versions -- was the player control; more specifically, the interaction, i.e. collision detection between the wave and the surfer. At its core, the control is fine. But what became quickly frustrating on the Xbox version is the inability to land aerial moves consistently and to explore crucial segments (the hook) of the wave surfers normally do. In the Cube version, airs, ollies, and aerial moves are much easier to pull off from other parts of the waves, so now you can gyrate, cutback, gain speed, and launch huge airs -- enough to perform 720s in one go and land them.   Furthermore, the game has been paced and explained much better for beginners and pros. For instance, the first beach, Kirra Point, instantly puts surfers on a wave so they can just go. Second, silly challenges, such as spraying birds, jumping jellies and whatnot, has been made more clear because simplistic icons spin above those animals' heads. The game starts off with easy goals and becomes increasingly harder, rather than just whaling on you with tons of hard goals right off the bat. So the controls have been tempered, so to speak, and the goals loosened. The game is now better paced, gives better control, and presents a better overall feel.  Rack up some combos, then ride the tube for major points. There are also a few upgrades over the PS2 version worth mentioning in this latest Cube Next Wave rendition.  In addition to the added surfers, extra location, and four-player support, the control has also been slightly tweaked in a few areas.  Cutbacks are now a bit more wide, and the camera quickly boomerangs around behind the surfer when whipping around close to the tube.  It's not necessarily a bad effect, just different and will require a slight adjustment for those hooked on the PS2 version.  Also, Infogrames has definitely taken our criticism of the slow and pointless paddling to heart, as surfers will now cruise at very high speeds when opting to bypass the Jet Ski girl and paddle toward the closest wave. Although it's not a realistic speed, it definitely makes the feature much more practical and even worth using this time around.  Very nice.  What still needs work in TransWorld Surf is multi-fold, and it starts with the waves themselves. Surfers should be able to get right into the hook of the neck and slash about. There should be more kinds of wave-based moves, not just various kinds of lippers and cutbacks, and the trick system should enable more modifications in air then it presently does. Which means there should be tons more tricks and ways to shred a wave.   The list of complaints goes on indefinitely, and that's because this is the first game in what hopefully will become an ongoing series. The waves catch and slow surfers down at the end of a snapback, which is bad. Also, those lame animal challenges are for boogie boarders, and they should be eliminated altogether. (Ooooohhhh! Busted. Boogie boarders!)    Graphics What was at first so amazing about TransWorld Surf when we first saw it was the player's ability to pan out far above the surf spot and check out the kind of waves he wanted to surf. The water textures were excellent. The game demonstrated moving whitewater textures, various pretty, reflective water surfaces, excellent barrel formations, foam, spray, wind-chopped water, and clean moving surfer animations. The Xbox version has its problems, too. It suffered from bad slips in the gameplay -- hiccups that stopped gameplay altogether as the information burning off the CD and hard drive caught up to the player itself. It also showed occasional framerate problems that distracted the eye and made for a less than perfect visual experience.   The PlayStation 2 version didn't quite live up to the visual level of the Xbox in the graphics department. It wasn't a huge leap back, but the difference is definitely noticeable. The PS2 game doesn't offer the same exact level of texture quality in the waves or the ocean itself, meaning that the depth and quality of the textures isn't as sophisticated nor as pretty. When in windy areas, the textures lack what looked like bump-mapped ripples in the waves themselves on Xbox, such as in the Fort Point area, and now offer simple, boring looking water in comparison.  The current GameCube release is based on this PS2 code, and looks closest to the visuals that gamers have already seen on the Sony console, albeit slightly upgraded.  There's still a tiny amount of aliasing along the top of the breaking waves, but the water looks even more reflective and brilliant this go around.  In terms of all three console releases, it definitely improves upon the efforts of the PS2 title while falling short of the pretty marks set by the Xbox version.  Where the PS2 version saw slowdown in several places (including the wave selection screen), the GameCube title is thankfully much improved.  The entire game runs at a very smooth 60 frames per second and rarely -- if ever -- slows down.  Even the split-screen two-player matches run equally fast, while the four-player action only drops a few frames here or there to keep up.  After seeing the PS2 game occasionally chop up last year, it's nice to see that Infogrames didn't simply port the same problems to the GameCube.  The framerate is definitely much improved on Nintendo's console, and it not only makes the game prettier, it's also slightly more enjoyable to play as a result.  Sound TransWorld's tricks are pretty good once players build up speed. Musically, TransWorld Surf offers up a slew of bands and songs that can be described as hip, cool, and new punk alternative bands, or alternatively, you can describe them as average, run-of-the-mill, been-there-done-that surf punk music. The point being that you've heard this stuff before, and now it's just got a surf beat to it. That's simplifying things a bit, but you get the idea.   After listening to the music for far too long, however, we can honestly say that some of it is good stuff that actually grows on us. All of the sound effects are average and most aren't worth mentioning.   The best feature in the game is that players can stop the game and in mid-move -- say, an ollie -- chose any song from any band in the game, test it, play it, switch to a whole separate kind of music (like chill stuff or slightly reggae-ish stuff) select it for the gameplay, and then finish off that luscious ollie with that brand new song.I love surfing games, and this is right up there with the best of them. The GameCube doesn't look as good as the Xbox version, but it actually plays a whole lot smoother thanks to better tuned collision detection, smoother moves animations, and a much better sense of speed. In turn, the better sense of speed creates a far more significant aerial/ollie aspect that's superior to the Xbox version in more ways than one. Players can earn huge scores here that were incredibly difficult to attain in the Xbox version, and I bet hard cash that more people will finish this game than the Xbox version. The improvement in gameplay this version is significant.That said, TransWorld Surf has a long way to go, and after my love affair with the Xbox version wilted, I realized in retrospect that perhaps I over-rated that version a bit, which accounts for the difference in scores from site to site.So, I'll be honest, this is not the equivalent of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on waves. At least, not yet. Granted, there are three versions of Tony Hawk out in the market place right now, and Angel Studios has only finished its first. But still, there is much work to be done. A more hefty set of moves and modifications are needed, more of the wave should be surfable, especially the hook of the wave, and there should be more variety of waves, more breaks, and more moves.All I can say is that after this review, I'm going home to play some more, which either means I'm addicted and crazy (a theory with has much merit), or that this game is crazily addictive (which has just as much merit).If you surf, go buy this. If you love extreme sports games, go buy it. And if you just like games, go rent it. It's worth your while.", "date": "Apr 1, 2003"}
