{"name": "Cleopatra", "name_review": "Cleopatra", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/02/cleopatra", "text": "Since console game publishers have pretty much abandoned the 2D side-scroller genre (and why shouldn't they, with great run n' jumpers like Klonoa 2 left to wither on shelves?), the Game Boy Advance and cellphones are about the only refuges left for old-timers. Unfortunately, most platformers have been marred with either awful control or uneventful action. But for those willing to risk another few bucks on a non-brand name game, G3 Studios' Cleopatra is a delightful blast from the past.   Features:   Eight levels, with additional bonus areas  Auto-save   Cleopatra plays a lot like the classic 8-bit platformers that swamped the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Well, the good ones, at least. The game is lively and well-paced, with colorful backdrops and plenty of run and jump action. For fans of the genre, it's hard to ask much more from a small investment like Cleopatra.   Players slip into the sandals of Cleopatra, the Queen of the Nile as she takes an unusual (and undocumented) trip amongst the commoners, battling snakes and mummies with only a boomerang. Cleopatra reminds us of the countless me-too heroes of 8-bit gaming -- not as much personality as Mario or Mega Man, but certainly a lot more than Lolo.   Cleopatra's plight is pure twitch. As you run from left to right, you must jump over pits (sometimes via the help of a trampoline) and on top of stones. When enemies approach, use your boomerang to turn them back. And between enemy encounters and jumping over hazards, you must collect the bounty of stars sprinkled throughout each of the sixteen levels.   Cleopatra enjoys a clean, simple control scheme that makes the run and jump element of the game smooth and fun to play. Tossing the boomerang is also easy, and the game wisely allows enough screen real estate before an enemy can attack -- you always have enough warning to let fly with the 'rang. No cheap hits here.Cleopatra is by no means an ambitious game -- but it is one with a complete sense of self. It attempts to be nothing more than classic side-scroller. Instead of layering the game with gimmicks that may or may not work, G3 has insisted on tight control schemes and breezy gameplay that anybody can pick up and enjoy.", "date": "Jul 2, 2004"}
