A few weeks ago, I posted a brief feature questioning the whereabouts of the mobile Brain Age. It turns out that quite a few mobile developers were thinking along the same lines, because shortly after the entry, I was keyed into several in-development brain-busters for the smallest screen. The first of this set to reach the decks is Digital Chocolate's Brain Juice, a fairly straightforward run at the Brain Age/Big Brain Academy concept. While I cannot exactly proclaim Brain Juice as reason to sell your Nintendo DS, it is certainly a smart, attractive complimentary piece to Nintendo's bestselling cerebral contests.   While Nintendo Brain games use age and weight to ~measure~ the so-called growth of your cortex, Brain Juice uses electricity as a quantifier of progress. The game's mascot is an animated light bulb that coaxes and prods players to do their best. He's cute, and I'd love to see him in a fight with Microsoft Office's gabby paperclip. The bulb gives a fun face to the game's cold, calculating brain games, much like the floating head in Brain Age. Should DChoc make a sequel or expansion pack, they should definitely bring him back.   Brain Juice follows the familiar formula of Nintendo's established series. Every day, you practice mental challenges and then take a test to log a measurement. The test consists of three randomly selected mini-games from the total number of games you have unlocked -- there are twelve total. The better you do at the mini-games, the more mini-games you unlock. During your first few days, you can practice the same games over and over, and just when you get good, Brain juice rolls out a new exercise.   The games are spread across three categories: math, visual, and memory. When you play a game, a timer bar across the top of the screen starts counting down. You can extend the bar by correctly solving a specific number of puzzles in a row. When time is up, the game shows you the final score and awards a medal, depending on performance. Medals ranged from bronze to gold, and it takes gold medals to really open up all of the games.   The mini-games in Brain Juice are all generally solid. Some, naturally are going to be more fun than others, depending on the players. Those that think spatially will likely enjoy the Path Memory game, in which you must retrace a path through a grid after watching a brief example. When the game was demoed for me, I was told not to try and memorize the pattern directly, but look at the negative space and recreate it.   Math-heads, however, will get greater kicks out games like Operators, where you have to look at an incomplete math formula and apply the correct operator, like + and /. Arithmetic is a more basic math game, where you use the number pad to quick answer math questions that get progressively tougher the longer to stay in the game.   Memory skills are tested with games like Elevators, in which you watch a sequence of men, women, and children go in and out of an elevator. After each sequence, the game asks how many of a specific type of person is in play.   That last game is a lot like the Brain Age mini-game where you counted party guests. For a fan of Nintendo's Brain Age series, I felt a certain amount of familiarity with Brain Juice that definitely dampened its personal impact. However, thinking about the game in the shoes of somebody who doesn't have a DS and knows Brain Age from boo, many of these games will feel fresh -- and a fun way to tease the brain to life after a maddening day in front of spreadsheets or a lumber dryer. I use those two examples for a specific reason -- Brain Juice really can be enjoyed by anybody. And those that may resist a mental challenge game full of math equations or color matching will be surprised at how the game sneaks up on you. The visual progress of watching your brain wattage grow is fun, even if it's hardly scientific. Everybody likes to be told they're getting smarter.  Setting aside the game's obvious inspiration by Nintendo's brain training DS titles, Brain Juice is a (ahem) smart game for mobile. The brain teasers and puzzles are perfect for quick mobile gaming sessions, allowing you to get in, get bright, and get out. The controls work exceptionally well (no BS with handwriting recognition here!) as most games are solved with pressing one of four directions on the thumbpad or punching in numbers. The desire to constantly improve scores keeps the game's expiration date at bay -- you'll want it around for a while. So, if given the option to subscribe or purchase, I'd recommend you buy it outright -- come on, be a cheetah.There are more brain training mobile games on the way, but I haven't played them in order to make any comparisons -- but I feel quite comfortable giving Brain juice a high recommendation. Who knew counting colors and solving math puzzles could be so much fun? (Well, a few million Japanese Nintendo DS owners, that's who.)", "date": "Jul 19, 2006"}
