Because that quick game will turn into a half-hour endeavor before you know it. I know this, because I thought I'd play it briefly the other night before hitting the sack, and the next time I looked up, I was on level 49 and the clock was reading 3:07 AM.   Oops.   To say Slyder is highly engrossing is an understatement. Built by Sandlot Games (a web version is available from Wild Games), Slyder asks you only to guide a glob of blue goo (complete with cutie-poo eyes) around a series of tiny mazes. However, as you progress deeper into the game, obstacles get more fiendish. The big catch is that the titular hero can only move in one direction at a time. He stops when he hits a wall; you cannot alter his path until he comes to rest against a flat surface.   This little wrinkle has allowed Sandlot to design 150 devious challenges full of hazards like pits, bubblegum patches that stop your movement, and bad guys like Ungers. Ungers resemble Slyder, but they gnash their teeth and glow red -- universal symbols for badness. Now, you can use Ungers to your advantage, such as sliding them into pits, and then safely rolling over them. There are also rollers (and evil rollers you cannot touch) you can manipulate in a maze to create a clear path to the exit.   The cool thing about Slyder is that it doesn't throw all of this at you at once. It eases you into it. First you learn how to move, then you tackle pits, then Ungers, then rollers, then bubblegum, etc. At no point do you feel overwhelmed, but drawn deeper into the game because you tell yourself over and over you can stop when you want...   Slyder is played using only the thumbpad. You only have to worry about traveling in four directions. You don't get much more accessible than this. Some players might find Slyder to be a little easy, but that's the hook -- it seems easy until you reach the threshold (and it's going to be different for every player) when the game starts becoming a challenge, and then it switches gears into absolute addiction.   The game doesn't require complex visuals, just a bright colorful game screen. On this, Slyder delivers. The little face on the hero fosters an odd emotional attachment, just like the rock from Skipping Stone. (Bring on the Slyder plush.)  Slyder is an excellent mobile game. It's opening levels are easy enough to get anybody interested, but when it ratchets up the difficulty, the game can become downright merciless. But I never thought it was unfair. I just needed to try harder -- to think a few moves in advance. If you're looking for a great, casual game to get you through the dull patches of the day, or want to purposely lose sleep like me, give Slyder a download. You won't regret it.", "date": "Jun 9, 2005"}
