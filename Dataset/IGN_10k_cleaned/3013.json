If the book sounds familiar, thats probably because Koei has released seven games with the same name over the past decade or so, and it has also been the basis for another Koei series, Kessen.  Knowing a little bit about the Three Kingdoms can really help the game make more sense.  To simplify the story (and I mean SIMPLIFY), China was ruled under Emperor Ling during what is known as the Han Dynasty.  The dynasty eventually fell, in part due to the Yellow Turban Rebellion, and the Empire was divided into the Shu, Wei, and Wu kingdoms.  Around 280 A.D., the Chinese Empire was reunited under the Jin Dynasty.  I know there are many, many more details in the story, but  I'm not an expert on Chinese history, and  I'm reviewing a game, not giving a history lecture, so forgive me for not going into more detail.  GameplayWhile the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, and even the Kessen series of games, fall more under the strategy umbrella of games, Dynasty Warriors 3 is more or less a straight beat-em up action game, with a few extra features thrown in that help break up the somewhat repetitive gameplay.  When first starting the game, you have several modes of play available-Musou, Free, VS, and Challenge mode, which consists of Endurance and Time Attack modes.  Musou is the where the meat of the game lies and is the equivalent of Story mode.  You can initially choose from nine different characters that each represent one of the Three Kingdoms- Shu, Wei, and Wu.  Each character has varying stats based on life, Musou, attack, and defense, and will start out with different storylines and cutscenes, though there are a few that are the same.  Before each battle you can choose your weapon (more are found during the course of the game), equip items youve found, and configure your bodyguards options, which include grade, number, model, type, and order.  There is also information available about battle conditions, the units (your officers as well as the enemies), and a short voice-over introducing the battle.Control in the game is relatively simple.  A jumps, X attacks, Y does another standard, but more powerful, attack, and B performs your Musou attack.  The left trigger guards/shifts and simultaneously re-centers the camera, and the right trigger will pull up a first-person view from which you can shoot your bow.  You can pull off combo attacks using a mix between your standard attack and your charged standard attack.  The maximum number of hits is determined by which weapon you have equipped for your character, of which there are four.  The game typically consists of you running around battling literally hundreds of enemies of different classes, eventually battling the head general.  Once you find and beat him, the mission is won.  In theory, you could try to run from all the enemies to find the general for a quick victory, but this will inevitably end with you being severely outnumbered.  You will also miss out on fighting the other officers, some of whom drop items that you can equip to increase your stats.  These may prove invaluable later in the game, so I found it best to fight a few battles along the way. For those times when you are surrounded, your Musou attack can be quite effective.  You have meter under your energy that increases every time you hit an opponent.  You can also hold down the B button to manually raise its level.  Once full, pressing B will perform your Musou attack, which is quite handy in clearing out all the nearby enemies.  The best time to use it though is when your energy is in the red.  At this time, your attack can last longer and also do more damage.  One of the complicating factors in battle is the heavy fog.  When looking around, its hard to tell where you can go and where you cant without running in a direction to see what lies ahead.  Will it be a bridge or a mountain?  Or how about a group of fifty enemy foes?  When trying to run to safety, or catch a breather from the battle, you often end up running right into another battle (or a wall) due to the fact that you couldnt see what was happening a hundred feet away.  This severely cuts down on the amount of strategy in a battle.  Also, you are not allowed to run up certain hills or jump/fall of ledges, even if youre just trying drop off the side of a walkway.  If youre running down a series of zigzag walkways, you have to run all the way down, then back, then down again...  This becomes very tedious and also makes it hard to flee quickly and effectively.   GraphicsDynasty Warriors 3 really shows its PS2 roots.  The main character models and textures are decent, but the landscapes are extremely barren and plain.  A tree here, a box there, and a few houses here AND there.  Theres just not that much around you to make these areas feel alive in any way.  This is also not helped by the horrible amount of fogging and limited draw distance.  Besides what is immediately in front of you, its hard to see really anything else, which can cause the problems I mentioned earlier.One of the reasons for all the fog, besides hiding the pop-in, is probably to keep the framerate up.  The game moves at a very smooth rate for the most part, faltering mainly when you are surrounded by a large amount of troops and executing a Musou attack.  When that happens, things can really start to chop up.  This can sometimes be a positive side effect due to the fact that it slows things down enough so you can get your bearings straight and aim your attack towards the higher-ranking officers.  SoundLets get this out of the way as quickly and painlessly as we can.  The sound in this game is terrible.  The music in Dynasty Warriors 3 is composed of the most laughable Japanese guitar-rock that I may have ever heard.  I cant even enjoy it as novelty.  Even it were good Japanese guitar-rock, why am I am listening to it while trying to maintain the Han Dynasty in ancient China?  Horribly out of place.One of the few things worse than the bgm is the English dub for the spoken parts of the game, and unfortunately, there are many of these.  Besides having the dialog not make much sense at times, the English spoken lines sound as if theyre being read off a sheet of paper for the first time.  By a foreigner.  Okay,  I'm exaggerating a little here, but some of the lines spoken seem to be accented in the wrong places, and in the wrong tone.  They just  don't  sound right.  Luckily, for all the game sound no-nos in the game, there are a few highlights, mainly the assortment of options available.  The most important of these is the ability to have Japanese voices, which are infinitely better than the English ones, for more than one reason.  First off, the characters actually seem to mean what theyre saying.  Maybe its only because I  don't  really know what theyre saying, but thats fine with me.  Secondly, it helps the authenticity of the game.  While I know the story takes place in China, and ideally everyone should be speaking Chinese, the game feels a little more realistic with an Asian language being spoken rather than English.  You can choose between the languages in the options, and even have subtitles in either language to accompany them, so everyone should find something suitable for their tastes.   Dynasty Warriors 3 reminds me a lot of Capcoms older arcade action games (Final Fight, Captain Commando, Knights of the Round etc...).  If Im not mistaken, I think they even had a game based off the same historical material (Dynasty Wars).  While those games are incredibly simple at heart, and amount to little more than button pushing, I always found them wholly satisfying in their own way.  Sometimes all you want to do is put your brain on hold and have fun beating up hordes of enemies (especially with a buddy).  Dynasty Warriors 3 lets you do just that, and even throws in a some cool features to help break up the repetitive nature of the game.  Riding horses and elephants, finding new weapons, and improving stats by equipping items in a very RPG-like way, all help to add a little depth to game that could get old very quickly.  If the developers can fix some of the underlying problems with the game and improve on what they already have to give the game a real polished feel, the Dynasty Warriors series could be one great stress reliever.", "date": "Oct 4, 2002"}
