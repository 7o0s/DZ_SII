After the big success of Battle Arena Toshinden, the great BAT fighting series went from star to skunk in a matter of sequels.  Don't get us wrong, the game has a lot of improvements. Like Sega's Fighting Vipers, the levels possess walls and ceilings. This allows a player to pin an opponent up a against a wall or bounce someone off the ceiling. Either of these can result into some pretty nasty combos.  The graphics? Hmm... If you set Battle Arena Toshinden 3 next to the first one, the first BAT looks better. On the other hand, the power moves look extremely colorful and add a little excitement to the game. But overall, the game doesn't look too impressive.  Gameplay has somewhat been improved, but compared to games like Soul Blade and Tobal 2, this game just doesn't cut it. Even when the game moves at 60 fps, the game still plays choppy and tends to be unresponsive at times.  Perhaps we are too nostalgic. After playing BAT 3, I had to turn it off and pop in the first BAT. This game started so many great ideas, it's painful to see such a popular fighting series take a downward spiral to crapville.", "date": "Jun 26, 1997"}
