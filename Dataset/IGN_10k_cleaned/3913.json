It wasn't that Raven had made such a great game; we were used to that already from Elite Force and Soldier of Fortune. What really shocked us was how well they captured the license and designed a really solid game around it. And now that Raven has offered up a sequel, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, they've managed to strengthen many of the features of the previous game.   So I should just cut and paste my Jedi Outcast review and replace all the ~greats~ with ~phenomenals,~ right? Well, not quite. While the title does many things better than Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy nevertheless comes with a few minor problems that bring entirely new frustrations.   One of the biggest changes is that you won't be playing as Kyle Katarn. I understand why Raven and Lucas opted to go with an entirely new character for the series but it's still hard to say goodbye to such an old friend. Still, it's better than a contrivance to get Kyle back to a weaker state to provide a compelling challenge and sense of progress to the game. I'm mollified somewhat by the decision to let players create their own character's appearance here but I can't shake the feeling that, since the character is created according to the player's preference, that we'll be seeing yet another character for Star Wars Jedi Knight: The College Years.   As a new student in the Jedi Academy you'll go on quite a few milk runs at the start. In all, the early levels aren't too much of a challenge and can be passed in the matter of a few hours. It's nice that the game offers a series of fairly short, relatively unconnected missions at the start. It's a great way to get your feet wet and ease you in to the environments and the saber fighting before the challenge level ramps up. You'll visit a surprising range of locations right from the start before settling in for the real work at hand.   That work, by the way, involves a new cult that's trying to siphon up Force power for reasons unknown. We're pretty sure that those reasons are at least somewhat nefarious, but since the point of the game is figuring out who's behind it and what they're up to, we hesitate to say more than that. Suffice it to say that you'll have a group of five missions to choose from after the introductory training is over. You can choose these missions in any order (and even skip the fifth one if you're that anxious to get on with the story) before you're forced to take a mission along the main plot line. Once that's done, you'll have the chance to choose from five more missions before the process repeats itself again. These smaller missions offer a chance to build up extra Force powers and even reveal some small clues to the overall shape of the main story.    But this relatively open mission structure doesn't come without some notable disadvantages. To begin with, the story's simply not as tight this time around. Since the player can now choose from a set of missions, the relationship they each bear to the overall story is less pronounced. This is quite a change of pace from the relentless plot that drove the previous game. Hell, the plot was so good, we didn't even mind the lengthy cutscenes that broke up the action. Here the cutscenes are shorter at least but definitely still lacking the impact of those in the previous game.    And to be honest, even if the story were told in a completely linear, focused fashion, it just still wouldn't be as good. Where Kyle's previous adventure involved love, revenge and the fate of the galaxy, Jaden's mostly just involves the fate of the galaxy. Since he's the player surrogate, we expect him to be a little flat, but it seems as if Jaden's only motivation throughout the entire game is to get through Jedi school. And while that might be okay on its own, as a follow up to the previous game, it definitely leaves us wanting more. You will face a moral choice in the game which does give some weight to it all (and changes the outcome somewhat) but I'd still like a hero whose main motivation wasn't passing his finals.   At least he gets to travel the galaxy. This was one of the big draws with Jedi Outcast and it's taken to an even higher level here. Since the team has managed to get the garbage masher and barfight levels out of their system with the previous game, Jedi Academy's free to break some new ground in the Star Wars universe. Ancient temples, floating industrial plants, dense cities and the rest are all on tap here. You'll even find yourself visiting places from the films, including the abandoned Rebel base on Hoth.   The game also reintroduces characters from the films. Since you're a Jedi, meeting Luke Skywalker is kind of a given. What you might not be expecting are the run-ins with other notables from the series. Although we won't spoil them here you can probably catch a glimpse of a few of them in the screenshots. They don't spend as much time with you or get as involved in your story as Lando did in the previous game but it's still nice to spend a few minutes fighting side-by-side or head-to-head with some big names from the films. The upside to all this is that you'll feel like you're playing a Star Wars game.   This impression is strengthened by the visuals and sounds. By now there's probably no gamer in the world who isn't intimately familiar with the various sounds of lightsabers, blasters and Wookiees and Jedi Academy uses all these elements perfectly. Likewise the music has been cobbled together from various elements of John Williams' score (with suitable, original transitions). Though the Quake III engine isn't the newest thing on the market any more, Raven's made excellent use of it here. Though the scale of the environments factors heavily in to gameplay, Raven's also been attentive to the little details and you'll find plenty of jawas and R2 droids for every AT-ST and Rancor you find. The saber fighting animations are superb with a wonderful sense of cinematic action.    And thank god that Raven decided to start you off with a lightsaber from day one. Though it was certainly a moment to build to in the previous game, the fact that there was a lightsaber on the cover of the box made the first few saberless hours of the game hard to bear. Not so this time around. And just to add that sense of accomplishment and progress, the game offers up a chance to try some new saber styles later on. You can pick from the double-headed saber or simply hold a saber in each hand. (Some poor misguided souls will doubtless still stick with the single saber but nothing can really be done to help these people.)    The range of movements and styles for each saber is considerable. Rolling lunges and fancy cartwheels are just the tip of the iceberg here. Once you get the extra sabers, you can perform all manner of flourishes, stabs and kicks. There are even a few kicks that you can perform once you've been knocked down. Most of this is pretty intuitive and though it still relies on somewhat awkward directional inputs and mouse presses, you'll find yourself getting the hang of it soon enough.   The enemies are as varied as before but some are quite a bit more challenging. Plenty of larger boss-type monsters will be found in the levels and quite a few of these can't be killed. One particular bad guy (who I could've sworn was dead but only because I don't read every single comic or novel associated with the franchise) merely pops in and out of his particular level, waiting until you beat him almost to death before he goes scurrying off again. A few enemies are also now equipped with rocket packs, putting them beyond your reach. Dealing with the flying enemies can be a nuisance, at least until you get the Mind Trick power.   On that topic, Jedi Academy actually lets you pick certain Force powers to advance in between the levels. Some powers, like Force Jump, progress according to a script simply to preserve mission design. No sense in including an incredibly hard jump in a level if you're not sure whether or not the player will be able to make it across. But being able to tailor your character by boosting Force Heal or Choke gives you a much stronger sense of individual identity this time around. And as before, you can use the powers however you like. The Light Side power Mind Trick actually lets you confuse enemies long enough to walk up and saber them in the back. Not exactly in keeping with the ideals of the Light Side but, hey, I'm a complex Jedi.   We have to commend Raven for tweaking the puzzles for this evolution of the series. While there are still jumping puzzles to be found (including an entire level that's basically one jumping puzzle), they are, almost without exception, much more appropriate to the context of the level. No longer are vital consoles located in ridiculously inaccessible places. Sure, there's the odd broad jump here and there but, overall, the jumping is much more controlled this time around. The new Force Sense power can even clue you in to operable triggers, like ledges that can be pulled or levers that can be pushed. This is a nice out for players who can't seem to notice the sometimes small puzzle elements on their own. Likewise, the new mounts in the game provide a new mode of play that's quite compelling.    Finally, the title has a fairly robust multiplayer component. Gone are the modes from the last game that no one ever played. You won't find Capture the Silly-Named Thing here, for instance. What you will find are the standard duel and deathmatch modes. There's even a duel mode that pits two weaker Jedi against a stronger one. One new mode, Siege, is quite compelling. Reminiscent of Wolfenstein's class-based objective mode, Siege requires teamwork and specialization from all players in order to work appropriately. We've had our own fun on this is more limited matches here at work and we're anxious to see what happens once the title ships and players start flooding the servers.For the 15 or so hours that it lasted, I thoroughly enjoyed Jedi Academy. Still, I couldn't quite shake the feeling that Jedi Outcast was more satisfying in terms of my involvement with the story. Jedi Academy dishes out more action sooner but fails to put it in as solid a context as the previous game. For some gamers, this won't be a problem at all. All they want is a great action game with the Star Wars stamp on it. Jedi Academy is this. But those who really found themselves drawn more to the story than the skirmishing will find that Jedi Academy isn't quite as fulfilling as its predecessor. But that's nitpicking, isn't it? The real test is that I wanted to finish the game and put off other projects just to spend a bit more time going back and tackling the new challenges. The new saber styles and the big either/or moral question add some variety to the game and give us hope that, in a few months time, we'll want to come back and try to make it through using a different approach.The simple version is this: if you like Star Wars and think flipping around chopping up Stormtroopers and flinging Dark Jedi off of conveniently placed precipices is fun, then this game is definitely for you. Just don't expect your battles with your inner demons to be as compelling.", "date": "Sep 16, 2003"}
