There have been six games released under the moniker, each with their own varying degrees of ~quality.~ For Disney Sports Motocross, the development team decided to clone Nintendo's own Excitebike for its Motocross game design, but pouring on way too many additional elements that do more to clutter up the gameplay than to help it along. This game isn't bad overall, but it clearly shows that less is more...and that adding additional stuff, like more elaborate track designs and power-ups, doesn't necessarily improve on a successful formula. Features Six courses Six modes of play Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  It's blatantly obvious that Konami lifted Disney Sports Motocross' game design foundation straight out of Excitebike; the game utilizes a side-scrolling engine where players control their bike in a four-lane track that goes over flatlands, hills, jumps, and bumpy terrain. The A button's gas, B button's turbo...use too much turbo and you'll burn out your engine, causing a costly stall during the race, but collecting a specific power-up will ~cool~ off the engine for additional turbo usage. Hit the ramps and angle your bike back onto the surface of the track to prevent a bounce that will slow down the speed of the vehicle, and use the back wheel to take out any opponents getting a little too close for comfort. The designers even took the N64 update's element of boosting off jumps to get a little more speed in the air. Sound familiar?  Now, I'm not knocking Konami for stealing Nintendo's game design; if you're going to base an arcade motocross racer off an existing game, might as well be Nintendo's classic arcade and NES game design. No, I'm knocking Disney Sports Motocross because of the developers' attempt to update the classic game design with elements that just don't work. Track layouts feature the classic dirt road, but they'll also cut over rooftops, pirate ships, and other ~extreme~ locations that fit the design theme. It's cute, but the tracks are extremely hard to follow because of all the clutter from the elaborate graphics that construct the tracks. As well as the backgrounds have been drawn, it's extremely difficult to see where the road goes, especially when it branches off into two or three directions. Some lanes even go up tiny ropes that are near impossible to recognize until your biker actually rides up them. Sure, after a few times around the courses you'll understand the proper routes to take, but there are so many places in the more complex circuits that'll probably make you go, ~Now how the heck was I supposed to see that?~ Excitebike kept things simple by putting the camera at a distance from the action, but in Disney Sports Motocross the view is zoomed in so close that it's many times difficult to see when the track, especially when airborne.  Like the other games in the Disney Sports series, Motocross also features gameplay that revolves around acquiring and utilizing power-ups. In this case, players will have to collect gems that are peppered around the tracks, building up their trick meter in order to pull off stunts that will award points and possibly give players an extra boost during the race. Fill up the power-up meter to its fullest level and players will be able to pull off a move that can cause harm to the other racers. But in later levels, the computer AI keeps things so far apart between racers that these super power-ups rarely come into play. And it's incredibly difficult trying to see where airborne gems are in relation to the specific lane on the track.  There are only six different courses in Disney Sports Motocross, which is obviously not a whole lot for a racing game. To add a bit more to the gameplay, Konami threw in a few extras, including multiplayer, time trials, a training mode, and three mini-games. The mini-games are okay, but extremely basic...and one, trying to stop the bike before it drives off the edge of the pier, is so easy that there's honestly no challenge at all. Just because it looks and plays like Excitebike doesn't make the game anywhere near as good as Excitebike. True, the original 15 year old Excitebike design just screams to get the GBA update, but Konami's try just comes off extremely disappointing. Disney Sports Motocross is certainly challenging, sure, but in many spots it's because it's just difficult to follow the action. It isn't all terrible, though, and it's certainly possible to enjoy the game if you can manage to see through some of the problem areas of the game design.", "date": "Apr 22, 2003"}
