I'm absolutely stunned that this game actually made it through Nintendo's stringent Quality Control group,  since this game isn't just riddled with bugs and design flaws, it also feels entirely unfinished. Either this game was rushed through development, or it was a title sitting on some programmer's dust-covered shelf and discovered by a Titus producer. Since we've heard about the existence of the Game Boy Color version of Titus the Fox for several months, I'll bet that the second option is the right answer. Features 17 levels of platform jumping action Bonus levels Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   First of all, if you're going to create a character that uses the namesake of your corporate name and logo, you might want to consider consolidating sketches and create a uniform character. Within Titus the Fox, you've got a fox character for the Titus logo, an entirely different fox character on the box art, an entirely different fox character for the title and cutscenes, and one more fox design for the actual in-game sprite. How are you going to expect a player attachment to a character that has no specific personality? He's constantly changing throughout the game.  But at any rate, this fox with four wildly different looks is out to rescue...well, you honestly don't know. The game fails to actually tell the storyline within the game, expecting folks to open up the three page pamphlet known as the instruction book and find out that Titus is on the hunt for his girlfriend Foxy. But don't expect any kind of transitions to tell you how you're progressing in this quest...  It's amazing how many things you can find wrong with a game without even looking  Titus the Fox has a checklist a mile long. I was almost in tear-filled hysterics trying to figure out how this game actually got through Titus' and Nintendo's QA departments in order to arrive on store shelves. The game on the box and manual is ~Titus the Fox~  (or if you go by how the logo's been designed, ~The Titus Fox~), but turn on the game and you get ~Titus the Fox:: To Marrakech and Back.~ No big deal  the subtitle didn't make the cut in the package design. But then you actually get into the game. The first level should be indicative of things rushed through, with a name such as ~Extra Level I.~  Finish the level and you head onto, of course, ~Extra Level II.~ Who came up with this naming structure, I think Hollywood needs another writer.  But these problems are merely cosmetic to the huge problems in gameplay. Titus the Fox is the most generically designed platformer possible on the handheld, but the design's amazingly flawed. The game runs at a snail's pace in the default difficulty setting,  making the game flow as fast as frozen toothpaste. The designer's idea of increasing the difficulty is to increase the game's speed in the ~hard~ mode...that's it. But then we get into the collision detection  while Titus will take a hit touching any part of his body on an enemy sprite (there's no bouncing on enemies' heads), the collision detection of picking up bonus tokens throughout the level is sloppy at its very best  you have to align the center of Titus on a pick-up token to get the game to register it.   And we will definitely not forget the ~clever~ level design  the task you have to perform is not obvious, as you have no idea what's expected to do to get through to the next level. In the first level, for example, all you have to do is start on the leftmost end and get to the rightmost end  but you can't do this on the second level, for the exit point here is invisible and placed somewhere up high. You'll never know it's there until you actually touch it and the game cuts to the ~Well Done!~ screen. It's awkward, confusing, and poorly implemented. What's more, the designer's idea of ~challenging level design~ is to hide ladders that can only be uncovered by walking over an invisible hotspot  some of which can only be stumbled upon if you jump or walk on a spot that might be considered ~random.~ What's more, in later levels, these hidden ladders turn into hidden rising walls that don't remove themselves when discovered  this causes a serious design flaw for folks that fall off the wall when it's being built, since the wall will block off access to the next part of the level. And apparently these guys realized that, for the manual offers a ~level reset~ function.  And we can't forget the awkward one-pixel-thick white aura that surrounds each sprite in the game -- this terrible ~style~ makes everything stand out like cardboard cutouts. The game's also filled with odd graphical glitches, like the bonus counter countdown at the end of the bonus rounds, but this is just too confusing a bug to describe so I'll leave it up to you guys to see it for yourself.  The only good thing I can say about Titus the Fox is its inclusion of a link-cable mode for two players. Here, another player can join in on the quest as a second character  this mode is identical to the single player mode, but the second player cooperates instead of competes. When one player beats the level, you both head to the next level together. But again, serious problems occur in this mode  super horrible flicker, for example, when two foxes and an enemy character show up on the same screen. What's more, we hit a bug when one player lost all his lives and the other player could continue  the game suddenly ran at twice the speed as it normally does.  Never before have I needed to point out so many horrible things in a game, but that's exactly what Titus the Fox is: really, really, really bad. It's clear this game was a part-time endeavor sloppily pushed through development  it's even a dual-supported (meaning Game Boy and Game Boy Color compatible) black cartridge title, which could mean that this game may have had an interesting history of being past through creation. Regardless, this is a fox you shouldn't nab  let it roam free in the wild and end up in the bargain bins.", "date": "Nov 9, 2000"}
