Having taken off less than ten minutes ago from an airfield in Belgium, I'm making excellent time. The large Dornier-217J is a heavy plane and fights back as I try to ease it higher and higher into the air. The fact that I'm carrying an extra 4,000 lbs makes the large plane handle even worse. In the true Christmas spirit, I'm delivering a parcel of high-explosive and incendiary gifts to our British friends across the Channel.   A quick check of my heading shows that I'm still on course to make my delivery at a tank factory along the eastern coast of England. For several days now our air forces have clashed over the narrowest part of the Channel. Raids on airfields, factories and shipyards have kept supplies low for both sides but it's made the pilots even more determined to strike out in retaliation. Flying by myself without any fighter escort, I've chosen a target well away from the rest of the action. By now the plane's at an appropriate altitude and I level off and throttle back a bit to conserve fuel. A quick check of the instruments shows everything's going according to plan.   Suddenly tracer fire flashes past my cockpit. While I was checking the map an enemy Hurricane has managed to sneak in behind me. Bullets slam in to my wings and fuselage. But while the Dornier makes a big target, the British flyer's made two crucial mistakes -- he's opened fire too early and he's closing too quickly. Rather than scissoring with the more agile fighter, I cut the throttle and ease the nose down. Realizing he's about to overshoot, the Hurricane pilot pulls left and speeds by me.   I gently roll the plane left and spray fire across his flight path. Heading off at an oblique angle, the Hurricane makes a big enough target for me to hit. As round after round slams in to him, the Hurricane pilot decides to continue diving. Once he's beyond my range he pulls vertical and turns back to face me. We speed towards each other counting down the distance until we both know our guns will do the maximum damage. We score several good hits on each other before he whizzes by me on the left.   Looking towards him, I can see he's scored several good hits on my left engine. As the plane slowly rolls left, I try to gauge the damage I've caused to the Hurricane. The enemy's making a diving extension away from me but whether he's running or crashing, I can't tell. I follow him for a few seconds as he drifts lower and lower. Once his plane slams in to the ocean, a smile crosses my lips. ~Auf Wiedersehen.~   A quick check of the plane shows that I'm too damaged to last long against the base defenses at my original target. The best I can manage now is to try to hit the shipyard on the way to the closest friendly airbase. Lucky me, it just happens to sit right in the middle of the stretch of coast that sees the most action. While it's a risk, it also gives me the chance to base myself at a field much closer to the action.   I follow the coast heading south until the shipyard comes in to view. There are a few German fighters in the area, so I can safely switch to the bombardier view to line the plane up on target. I'm cutting across the shipyard along it's longest axis so I can drop my entire payload of seven bombs in one pass. As I move in, tracer fire arcs up towards me and anti-aircraft blooms appear beside me. I drop my payload and demolish dozens of buildings at the shipyard before punching the throttle and diving down and away towards the friendly airfields in France.   A few minutes later and the French coast appears before me. Flying low and fast, I cut the throttle in anticipation of hitting the airfield. As my speed and altitude drop, the problems with the left engine become more severe. The wild torque is hard to handle, and at low altitudes it can be particularly deadly. I extend my flaps and lower the landing gear just as the airfield appears spread out before me. Coming in very low, I keep one hand on the throttle and one eye on my airspeed. I'm just about to touch down when I realize that I've cut my throttle a few precious seconds too early. I push the throttle all the way up to slow my drop but I slam on to the runway leaving a giant gaping hole right in the taxi path of two fighters waiting to take off. Seems I'll be seeing Hurricane boy much sooner than I'd planned.   That's half an hour of my life in Jaleco and VR1's Fighter Ace 3.5. This new update builds upon the success of the previous game, Fighter Ace 3 and you can assume that the basic judgment of that review applies almost exactly to the updated version. But there are some notable additions and some interesting new features that bear closer examination.   In brief, Fighter Ace is an online game of aerial combat set in the Second World War. Players can choose from a range of arenas each offering unique setups and realism models. From arcade-like deathmatches between the five combatant nations (America, Britain, Germany, Japan and Russia) to fully-realistic recreations of historical battles, Fighter Ace offers a wide variety of experiences. But while there's a nice range of experiences, the game is only fun with other people, so you may find your choices limited somewhat by the need to go where the players are.   With every new iteration, the Fighter Ace team enlarges the stable of flyable aircraft. This time around there are nearly 100 planes to choose from, each modeled in terms of appearance and performance. Standbys like the Bf109 and Spitfire are supplemented by other less well-known planes like the Tomahawk and the Jack. You can check out the full list of flyable planes at the Fighter Ace website.   I'm still a bit cranky that the team has included so many variants of the standards rather than branching out and adding completely new planes. After talking with the team, it makes sense that they can produce five versions of the Bf109 much more quickly than they can produce five different aircraft, but I still miss my 110s. The German twin-engine fighter isn't the only plane that's missing either. And although the Betty is a nice option, the Japanese could really use a more robust heavy bomber.    The new version has also tweaked the ranking system a bit. In previous games, players accumulated points through shooting down enemies. At particular point thresholds, you'd increase in rank (cadet to sergeant to lieutenant and so on). The only real problem with this method is that it offered persistent players the same opportunities as skilled ones. Since the ranks were intended to indicate the quality of the pilot, a determined player could do just as well over time.   While this problem can't (and probably shouldn't) ever be completely eliminated, the team has decided to weight the factors differently. Since it's harder to get kills in the full-realism arenas, points for kills are increased above the values in the soft-modeled rooms. It should be noted that there are still some problems and inconsistencies with the scoring but it makes a bit more sense now than it did before. Right now the arenas are rated only in terms of realism and not in terms of player ability. Hopefully some novice arenas can be added to help ease players in to the game a bit better.   The bombers play a crucial role in the Territorial Conquest mode. Each installation on the map (called a ~scene~) represents an airfield, a factory or some type of military structure. (There are no towns or cities in the game.) Doing a sufficient amount of damage to any one scene triggers a ground offensive. Your tanks and troops roll in and take over the base from the enemy. Currently the only available Territorial Conquest map represents the early fighting between Germany and Britain. And unfortunately the AI doesn't quite work so the base offenses and scene captures are all fairly theoretical.   The game also includes new bomber formation commands, letting one player fly a group of planes while the others man their turrets and scan the skies. Simply fall in to formation with a friendly bomber and engage the auto-follow command. This keeps your plane in the same orientation towards the leader and lets you focus on defending the formation.    More significant is the addition of cargo drops and paradrops. Each side now has a cargo plane, like the C-47 on the American side, that you can use to drop equipment and men around the map. This really helps open up the game a bit as you can now seize bases in the enemy rear. Previously, the fronts in Fighter Ace would be fairly static, pretty much negating one of the key strategic benefits of a highly mobile air force. Imagine taking a formation of three Dakotas and four Tempests to an enemy airfield. The Tempests can work the base over for a minute before the Dakotas drop their paratroopers. Once the base is sufficiently destroyed, your own tank columns are triggered to move in.   Once the team gets the AI working, they plan to add up to 27 historical battles. The triggers and scripting for these battles allows them to run in either a persistent form or as timed events. Maps like Midway may even include things like battleships steaming in to bombard the island. A number of speculative battles will be included as well. Imagine the US and Great Britain going to war over the origination of baseball.   The only real problems with these large events (which the VR1 team has been committed to for some time now) are that they require a bit more cooperation than might be enjoyable and that they tend to put more stress on the servers. Once you've got 180 players scrapping above Pearl Harbor, you'll see performance drop a bit. The solution is taking the graphics detail down a notch or two. (The team may even include this advice as part of the regular mission briefings.)   There are still some other serious server stability issues that need to be addressed. Having played the game for a solid week, I can say that I've only experienced a handful of timeouts and deserted lobbies, but according to the community and the folks at Jaleco, others are having a worse time of it. We talked with Doug Johnson over at Jaleco and he told us that a comprehensive patch is in the works and will be released as soon as possible. While he wasn't willing to estimate a delivery date, he says it's a top priority for the team. In the meantime, they'll be releasing several server patches to fix smaller issues.   What did you think of Fighter Ace 3.5?   The team also plans on releasing client updates with new features, new planes and new maps. Jaleco was again unable to provide specifics on what would be included and when it would be released. The game should be in stores now and the boxed version includes three-month's free online play for new subscribers. After that, the fee is about $10 a month.While I'm a fan of some of the other sims out there, like IL-2 and the CFS series, I've always found more interest in these online community games. Dogfighting against one person is much better than fighting against the computer AI. And fighting against dozens of human opponents is even better.  The community has always been a strong component of this franchise and these players, most of whom are 2.5 or 3 vets, are no exception.As I said of the previous game, it's great to play whether you've got twenty minutes or three hours. I've jumped in for a quick scrap in between editorial meetings and I've locked myself in my house for an entire weekend with this game. Anyone who knows me could probably predict that I was going to give this game a good recommendation, as I've been a big fan of the series for some time now. The developers are part of their own community, which makes a world of difference.", "date": "Dec 12, 2002"}
