The past few years have seen new takes on such vintage titles as Castle Wolfenstein, Asteroids, Frogger, Centipede, and Battlezone.  Now Utopia Technologies has brought back Max Montezuma in a new first person 3D adventure, Montezuma's Return.  I remember playing the original Montezuma's Revenge on my Apple IIe back in the day.  The side-scroller, a mix between Donkey Kong and Tutankhamun, was fairly addictive for its time.  For those of you who remember Montezuma's Revenge, I can tell you that the update bears little resemblance to its predecessor.    In Motezuma's Return, you assume the role of Max Montezuma, descendant of the legendary Aztec King Motezuma and heir to his treasure.  The game opens with Max at the controls of his sturdy prop plane over Mexico during a perilous storm ... well, maybe it's not so sturdy.  Lightning strikes the plane and Max is forced to jettison his ride and jump to safety.  He just happens to land safely in an ancient Aztec temple filled with pearls, gems, and masked natives.    The designers over at Utopia technologies must've been beat with the goofy stick before producing this one 'cause nearly everything about the game is off the wall in some sense.  The feeling of the game is extremely tongue in cheek, with the bad guys being deadly and hilarious at the same time. The enemy characters run around making incredibly wacky noises akin to the dodo bird from the classic Warner Brothers cartoons.  How do you kill 'em?  Use your hands and feet as there are no weapons to be found in the game.  Even your own appendages look extremely goofy.  What Utopia Technologies calls ~offbeat, imaginative combat scenarios~ I call just plain silly, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that in and of itself.    What is wrong with Montezuma's Return is the gameplay.  This game suffers from major roller-skate syndrome - you continue to move even after you take your finger off the movement keys.  Although it gives a rather smooth sense of movement, this is incredibly frustrating during some of the more precise jumping puzzles.  And there are plenty of jumping puzzles.  This game plays just like a typical console side-scroller except it utilizes a first person 3D camera view - and, in my opinion, jumping puzzles are ridiculous when you can't even see your feet.  As far as jumping puzzles go, Montezuma's Return does include some pretty innovative twists, but they're still just jumping puzzles.  Because of this, gameplay quickly becomes monotonous and the game seems to drag.  There's also no way to save your game in the middle of a level so, if you burn through your lives on a particularly tricky puzzle, you have to play the entire zone again.  The graphics in Montezuma's Return are ok, but not up to par with other 3D adventure games.  The rooms are extremely sparse (you'll be fascinated by the occasional urn or palm tree) and the low polygon count makes for very blocky objects.  Because of this the game looks dated compared to today's standards.  The designers did make good (and gratuitous) use of lighting effects, and several of the strobing colored rooms are enough to produce flashbacks in those of you who survived the 60s.  In the end, Montezuma's Return just can't compete in the modern 3D market. Had it meet its original release date over two years ago maybe it would have been a great game, but now it just looks outdated.  Sure, it's entertaining in small doses and its $20 price tag does make it a bargain, but Montezuma's Return doesn't have what it takes to keep gamers hooked.  I'm afraid that, unlike its predecessor, Montezuma's Return isn't destined to become a classic.  -- Tal Blevins I'm impressed with how well the remake has come out on the Game Boy Color, considering the source of the game's track record on the system. It seems that a classic can really shine on the trusty Nintendo handheld, even when it's been designed a bit different than the original. It's a great game that has a few gameplay issues, but all in all I'm very satisfied with how the conversion came out. It'll last you quite a while from start to finish.", "date": "Jan 7, 1999"}
