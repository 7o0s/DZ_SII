Pokemon, as a franchise, still seems like it's a fresh addition to Nintendo's portfolio -- even though it's been around for over nine years in America. And Pokemon Snap, the first game in the series to ever come to a home console, just doesn't feel like it's a game design made in the last millennium. But it, too, is almost a decade old. It's all hard to believe, that is, until you actually sit down and start to play it again. Because removed from the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia and placed into today's modern context, this is a game that certainly shows its age.   Pokemon Snap is a photography adventure. It's a game where you take on the role of a young shutterbug student working with Professor Oak on an isolated island, trying to complete a pictorial report of the area's resident monsters by taking a photograph of each and every one. You work with the professor in the laboratory to collect and catalog the report, trying to put together the best photo album possible -- and then you head out into the wild to shoot more and better action portraits of all the many species.   The game's action/photography sequences play out on rails, meaning that you're confined to a set and established path through each area and you constantly move forward along the track. It's like a safari ride at Disney World as you roll along through each environment at a steady pace, all the time keeping your camera at the ready -- because when a Pokemon appears, it's time to snap some shots. You hold down the Z Button (or L, as it's now mapped on the Classic Controller) to focus your camera's lens, then click away by pressing A.   Photogenic Pokemon appear in your path, as you move constantly forward along an on-rails track.  It's an interesting design, one that was completely unique at the time of its release. And, even today, it's still never been knocked off too egregiously -- games like Fatal Frame certainly share some of Snap's design direction, but none of its happy-go-lucky tone. You earn the smile and assurance of Professor Oak at the end of each expedition as he grades your work, joyfully awarding bonus points for better framing of each subject, or capturing a monster in the middle of an action pose. It's fun.   The problem, and where the game shows its age, is in its lack of depth.  Pokemon Snap flows well for the first few trips you take out into the wild, but soon becomes repetitive as it reveals its shortened scope -- there are only seven different areas to experience, and only a relative handful of the total number of Pokemon characters to find and photograph. The game has 63 different Pokemon species in it, which was already a limited number back in the time of its original 1999 release. Then, there were 151 total Pocket Monster creatures, so gamers were getting less than half of what they expected when they played through the N64 cartridge.   But now the low number of monsters on the roster is even more apparent, and more of a problem -- since the franchise has grown over the past decade, now 493 different, unique monster characters are part of the series. That means Snap features only roughly 13% of the amount of current characters in the Pokemon world.   It's disappointing, as gamers introduced to Pokemon through its second, third or fourth generations won't be seeing any Totodiles or Torchics here, much less any twinleaf Turtwigs.   There is one new feature included in Pokemon Snap's Virtual Console version, and it's a notable one: freshly-added Wii functionality. Once per day (sadly, yes, only once per day) you're allowed to pick one of your favorite photographs and post it to your Wii Menu's Message Board. There, it remains as a marker for you to see and remember as long as you like. And you can send copies of the snapshot to friends whose Wii Friend Codes you've registered to your Address Book.   It's an encouraging addition, because, while it's simple, it's the first occasion of Nintendo actually taking the time to make any modern upgrades to one of their Virtual Console releases. Sin & Punishment got a fresh English translation for its menus and tutorial mode, so added effort has gone into VC titles before -- but this is the first occasion of an older game interacting with elements of the Wii that exist outside itself. Fans who've been hoping for upgrades to classic titles like added online multiplayer for Mario Kart 64 or leaderboards for Star Fox should be emboldened by this small step in the right direction, and should consider downloading Snap and using its new photo-sharing feature as a show of support.Pokemon Snap's arrival on the Virtual Console comes with both positive and negative considerations. On the plus side, the added Wii functionality and ability to share your photos with friends is definitely notable and one of the most interesting and encouraging features we've seen added to a classic game release, well, since the VC first launched last year. But on the negative end, Snap is a game that's certainly showing its age now more than ever before  its franchise has gone on and grown through the past decade, and it's still crippled by only featuring a small subset of the very first generation of Pocket Monsters. What the Snap concept really needs isn't a VC re-release with a bit of added-in photo sharing  it needs a sequel. A full-on follow-up made for Wii that updates the design, adds in more of the newer monsters and natively encourages picture swapping from the start. It's a concept that could find a perfect home on WiiWare if not developed as a full retail release, and could make use of the motion-sensing abilities of the Wii Remote to become your ~camera.~ You've taken a right small step in a positive direction with this release, Nintendo. Now take this bit of momentum and carry it forward to its logical next stop.", "date": "Dec 12, 2007"}
