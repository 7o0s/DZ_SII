With well-known names like Mario, Sonic, Wario, and Crash Bandicoot constantly seizing the headlines and newbies like Vexx, Vince, or Ty overlooked because they follow too closely to the generic collect-a-thon model, it's risky for companies and gamers to invest in titles that star unheard of heroes.    However, THQ and Nickelodeon have gone out on a sheep-filled limb to create Tak, a dimwitted Pupununu tribesman thrust into the role of hero. Perhaps Tak has it easy because he has Nickelodeon's backing -- eventually getting his own cartoon -- but Tak will still have to socialize with the big boys. Will he be able to hold his head high in the company of Mario and Sonic or should he start shopping for a classy paper bag? Read on to find out.   Features  Embark on a mission to save your fellow tribesmen from the evil Tlaloc.  Run, jump, swing, and thwack your way through worlds like the Burial Grounds, Chicken Island, Tree Village, and Dryrock Canyon   Collect 17 powerful Juju spells that will aid Tak in his journey  Enlist the aid of Juju spirits to when the going gets tough  Transform into a chicken or fish to overcome obstacles   Relax from platforming with snowboarding and sandboarding mini-games  When Tak is bored, he plays toss with his buddies. Gameplay  According to Pupununu prophecy, an evil shaman named Tlaloc will be passed over during village elder selection in favor of Jibolba. Out of jealousy and rage, Tlaloc steals the Moon Stones, a source of great power that the Moon Juju uses to shield the Pupununu village from evil. If that isn't bad enough, as a farewell present he's going to turn all the villagers into sheep. It will be up to a powerful Jibolba-trained warrior to defeat Tlaloc and save the Pupununu people from sheepdom.    One day, Jibolba becomes a village elder and Tlaloc steals the Moon Stones. However, in some odd, un-prophesized twist, Lok, the village warrior wasn't saved by Jibolba's anti-sheep spell and now sports a fine wooly coat. Unable to comprehend how the prophecy steered him wrong, Jibolba is forced to entrust the future of his people in the unlikeliest of people -- the goofy Tak. Since some might say he's not the smartest of the Pupununus, Jibolba summons a mighty Juju spirit (that'd be you) to watch over the errand-boy Tak as he searches for ingredients to change Lok back into a warrior.   Tak will have to explore several locations, like tombs, a treetop village, a chicken infested island, canyons filled with exploding cacti, or a spirit realm. Each environment is accessed from Tak's village, which serves as a hub world. Tak will be forced to explore each of these different realms numerous times, but each excursion will lead him to a slightly different area with new hazards and enemies.    Although a lot of Tak's adventures involve tracking down various items for Jibolba, bringing them back to the village, and then trekking back into the nerbil filled world for more, Tak doesn't play like your typical platformer collect-a-thon. Instead of the hundreds of small items to track down in every area, the only constant collecting are feathers that replenish health or magic. Missions send Tak in search of an ancestral staff or spirit rattle, gathering magical plants, leading mummies out of their tombs to a gateway, or collecting yorbels. Well, there are a lot of yorbels to collect -- 100 to be exact, but Jibolba kindly informs you that when he was a young tribesman, you needed 10,000 yorbels to cast the same spell -- so you're making out easy. Yorbels are the only item that's annoying to track down, but it hardly tries your patience since there are twice as many in the world than what you actually need.    In fact, finding items is generally easy -- there are rarely moments where you have no idea where to go or what to do next. This ease of navigation can be attributed, mostly, to your helpful Juju guide Flora. She'll give Tak advice on how to tackle various situations, point out objects that some gamers might miss, or tell you where you should go. Sometimes she offers a little too much help and doesn't allow you to figure things out on your own, but most of the time you're already doing whatever she's instructing you to do. And, considering that this is a Nickelodeon property and at some level aimed at kids, her inclusion is necessary. Flora is also a lot less annoying than other recent sidekicks like Navi or Tricky.  When Flora isn't on the case, you'll usually be led to your next destination by trails of feathers. While she or the feathers often point out where items are, it's not the searching for, but the getting to that's the tricky part in Tak.    Orangatans are useful for catpulting other creatures besides Tak. Tak does do his fair share of jumping between platforms, swinging or climbing on vines, and battling nerbils (small gremlin creatures), but the unique gameplay mechanic in Power of Juju is how Tak is forced to interact with animals in his jungle to get from place to place. That's right, chimps scampering through trees or sheep nibbling on foliage aren't just for decoration -- Orangutans catapult Tak to far away platforms via banana trees and rhinos can be used to break through barriers. If Tak flings fruit at a monkey, the monkey will throw fruit at the closest creature -- eliminating nerbils, making a sheep run on a generator, or moving a chicken off a switch. Emus will give Tak fast transport throughout a world. Tak even needs sheep to disguise himself from head butting rams or guards.    As Tak delves deeper into his adventure, he'll be instructed to seek aid from powerful Juju spirits. When he finds a Juju shrine and its corresponding tiki, a Juju is summoned who will either unlock a new area for Tak to explore or give Tak a new power. A crude, two-headed Juju will give Tak a chicken suit (letting him fly/glide) if he's willing to enter a foul outhouse. He also can acquire a suit that turns him into a fish to explore water realms.  Accompanying these powers are Juju spells that Tak can collect. These usually cost magical feather power to cast but they let Tak see the soul of nerbils (so that he can absorb them as health or magic) or turn nerbils into chickens.    Breaking up the platforming action are two mini-game levels, Powder Canyon and Numa Dunes. These locals let Tak carve his way down slopes on a snowboard or sandboard. While these locations exist primarily to give gamers a fun break from standard platforming, they're also an easy way to collect both yorbels and feathers by performing tricks and getting lots of air.    While Tak does do a lot of things well, like incorporating the animal based puzzles and gives gamers specific objectives instead of demanding lots of little objects --Tak also doesn't do anything really revolutionary. The animals are a great inclusion, but they're really just another gimmick that replaces a water pack, or some other puzzle oriented device found in other games. The core gameplay of Tak is straightforward and fairly easy thanks to all the in-game help you receive. You aren't even penalized for dying -- you're simply regenerated at your last checkpoint by Flora, who gives you some friendly encouragement. Tak is fun, but it'd be your standard platformer if it weren't for the humor infused throughout the entire game.   Humor is Tak's secret ingredient -- it's what carries the game. Whether it's the opening cutscene where you learn that Lok has been turned into a sheep, an intense fight with a decaying, mummified warrior to claim the ancestral staff, or a potty mouthed two-headed Juju, Tak makes you want to laugh. If it's not an actual cutscene, in-game action like Tak walking around disguised as a sheep or flying about in his googly-eyed chicken suit will make you fall in love with this goofy tribesman. Other great moments are found in the Mummy Tombs, where Tak is charged with leading mummies from their crypts to a central temple. Since they can't jump, these mummies will walk through fire and then stamp out the flames or act as a mummy-pincushion for darts. The presentation is just great -- the humor, if nothing else, will keep interested in Power of Juju   If you are able to defeat Tlaloc, there aren't any increased difficulties or unlockable characters to get you to don the chicken suit once again, but it will take you a while to one hundred percent the game. Collecting all the feathers, yorbels, magic plants, etc, unlocks concept art from the design process that details how characters evolved and even shows areas and characters that weren't incorporated in the final product. Also, every time you see view a cutscene in game it will be unlocked for future viewing.   Tak, Tak, Tak of the jungle... Graphics  It's no surprise that Tak looks exactly like a cartoon considering THQ's partnership with Nick Games, but Avalanche has done a great job of bringing Tak's world to life thanks to detail and animation. As Tak runs around grassy plains, his feet rip grass blades out of the ground. Clouds of dirt sprout up around his feat when he runs across sand. You can see wood grains on huts, orangutans are covered in hair, and you'll even be able to see the bumpy skin of rhinos.    Animation is equally impressive, whether it's Tak's feathery hair decoration flapping as he runs, the pupils of his chicken suit roving independently around the eyeballs, the sheer terror on the face of sheep as they're tossed into the air and carted about on Tak's back, or mummies ambling about with darts sticking out of their wrappings. Cutscenes are filled with detail. You can see individual hairs sticking off of sheep or the creases in Jibolba's skin. These really look like they're something that would have aired on TV. The art direction, while it looks very Nickelodeon-ish, perfectly fits the property and makes you fall in love with the goofy characters.    You are given complete control of the camera, except for a few moments where the camera is fixed to the side or overhead to aid in the platforming. Even with complete control, you rarely need to worry about the camera because it tracks Tak well on its own. Tak also has no noticeable framerate problems and minimal load times between new areas -- making Tak is a delight to see in motion and to play.     Sound  While trekking across Tak's world, one of the most noticeable differences in locations, besides for physical differences, is the musical score. There isn't a ton of variation, you'll usually hear the same theme looped throughout each stage, but what there is good. In fact, you rarely notice that you're listening to the same music over and over (and the score is quite prominent in Tak). When you switch stages, the mood of the music changes to match the location. The rather happy and carefree melody you hear on Chicken Island suddenly becomes foreboding and wary when Tak explores the mummy tombs.   While the sound effects are rather minimal and are reserved for the thwacking of Tak's weapons, the thud of him falling great distances, or the aural warnings that enemies are about, the voice acting more than compensates. The voices match the characters perfectly, whether it's the cruel Tlaloc, the childish Tak, or the somewhat aloof and senile Jibolba. The aural Power of Juju is quite strong, and aids in bringing this new property to life.   Lately, platformers have resorted to uninspired collecting marathons. Tak manages to breathe new energy and life into the genre. While not a revolutionary title, Tak possesses enough characteristics that you want to play it through it. Perhaps it's because of the goofy main character, a humorous plot line, or some creative ways to present age old puzzles, but you're compelled to play through Tak. It's fun and incorporates platform collecting in a way that doesn't seem like you're gathering all sorts of items. Although Tak is straightforward and simple, it is designed for kids and should provide a challenge while keeping them entertained. If you're an older gamer, Tak is still a fun, light-hearted romp even if it doesn't provide you with excessive challenge -- you might be surprised by what sort of power this Juju using tribesman has.", "date": "Oct 14, 2003"}
