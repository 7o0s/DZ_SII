The joke that an episode of Law & Order or one of its spin-offs is always playing is not hyperbole. There are so many episodes of these shows you could fill an entire channel. And lest you somehow escape Law & Order on the small screen, Limelife has put the team on the smallest screen in Celebrity Betrayal. It's a story-driven legal game in the vein of Capcom's Phoenix Wright, but without the frilly outfits and over-the-top dialog.   Celebrity Betrayal opens in a club. A minor celebrity singer has been killed -- perhaps murdered. You must investigate the suspected murder, picking up evidence and interviewing characters associated with the case, such as husband, friend, and manager. The action unfolds over static screens at various locations, like the club, an apartment, and an interrogation room. You scroll around the scene with a cursor, zeroing in on objects of interest. If you see something that catches your eye (and turns the cursor green), click on it. This is how you not only find clues and bag evidence, but also initiate conversations with suspects and periphery figures.   Interrogations are composed of branching dialog trees, but they seem to always travel to the same destination. While talking to suspects, you watch a bio-meter over their heads. Green means the suspect is wholly comfortable. When it's pushed into the red, you've hit a roadblock. Either you pushed too hard or you've entered territory the suspect has no desire to talk about. The actual text itself is very well-written and one of the highlights of the game.     The investigation scenes are the strongest parts of Celebrity Betrayal, although I have to point out that you will find a better detective experience not only in Capcom's Phoenix Wright, but also Gameloft's CSI games. Where Law & Order really stumbles are the inane mini-games. You are a rookie along for the ride in this case, which offers a framework for making to perform base-level tasks like sorting warrants or getting coffee. The coffee mini-game in particular, where you must assemble orders by adding milk or squirting chocolate into various cups, is a low point. It's even duller than the paper-shuffling warrant mini-game that you must play over and over in order to get to talk to people or sift through potential evidence.   The game picks up again in court, when you have brought you suspect to trial. The game gets sharp here, and these mini-games -- case Overload and Takeout Dash -- are somewhat better than the warrant shuffling game. if you like the pacing of the show, you'll enjoy how things start to tie together here. You must call objection to testimony and refute with evidence or previous statements. The game gets trickier here and there is some real strategy when working the stand.   Limelife managed to get complete cooperation from Dick Wolf Productions, so the cast members from the show appear in the entire game. That's a nice touch of authenticity. The game even has a rough approximation of that dun-dun sound that punctuates scene changes.Law & Order: Celebrity Betrayal is a solid approximation of the television powerhouse and I am certain that fans of the show will enjoy the game. The mystery is well-written and it does take a few turns you might not otherwise expect. The boring mini-games hobble some of my enthusiasm, though. But the way conversations can be shut down and you can pick different suspects to bring to trial does add replay value.Also, needs more Sam Waterston. But then again, everything needs more Sam Waterston.", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
