The third of Reflections' physics masterpieces, Driver follows Destruction Derby 1 and 2, after almost a three-year hiatus (i.e. working on Driver).   The Destruction Derby series brought gamers a world of smash-'em-up races and destructible cars that behaved like real ones, taking damage until they were too taxed to move. Prior to these games, nothing of the sort had ever been seen on a console. Every part of the cars could take damage, the engine took to flames, glass windows shattered, hubcaps went flying, and the tetxured hoods and trunks would change in shape as they were bashed into junk. And yet the cars would drive until that one special hit took them permanently. And then there was the ultimate in every-man-for-himself demolition derby, Wreckin' Race, where our entire office would drop what they were doing and competed for the posting the longest times.  In Driver, GT Interactive and Reflections have taken the excellent ideas that were somehow restricted and linear in the Destruction Derby (DD) series, and have fleshed them out in a stylish driving game that's practically an entertainment center all its own. The good ideas in DD are brilliantly achieved in Driver, regardless of what mode you decide to play, leaving that old half-way feeling behind.  Gameplay The world Reflections has envisioned is a fast-paced, urban adult environment, where big afros, big-ass 8-cylinder engines, and a sleazy kind of Blaxploitation sensibility rules the day. In essence, you return to the soul of the 1970s. Which, thanks to TV shows such as Starsky and Hutch and the Dukes of Hazzard, and movies such as Steve McQueen's Bullitt and The French Connection, were the pioneering days of the great car chase. That's what Driver aimed for and came up with in flying colors.  Driving Modes With so many modes to choose from, Driver is deep and varied, enabling just about everyone who likes to drive to dig into some aspect of the game. The many modes are Undercover - The Story mode, in which you pull off all kinds of mission based objectives to uncover the bad guy, Castraldi. Car Chases - This is where you store your Director's Cuts, and where pre-installed movies exist to get an idea as to how to make movies. Training - Made up of the Desert and Garage test areas, in which you earn your colors. Cheats - Cheats, what else? Driving Games - An assortment of games that are a kind linear division of all that's good in Driver. These include Pursuit (Chase and destroy a cop car), Getaway (Lose a cop), Cross-Town Checkpoint (Hit all of the check points in the city and earn a top score), Trail Blazer (Follow the path of flags in a limited amount of time), Survival (Stay alive as long as possible while a posse of super-aggressive cops try to destroy your car), Dirt Track (Test yourself against a ghost in a time test on dirt). Take A Ride - Want to just drive around and smash into things with abandon? This is the place, although it's wise to stay away from the cops... Options - Adjustments to difficulty levels, screen placement, etc.  High Scores - Post your best scores and sneer at your poor friends who you just topped.  In the Undercover mission - the core of the game -- you play an undercover cop who must work his way up through the ranks of drug peddlers, thieves, and pimps to meet with the big man, the leader of the Castraldi Family. Players get the chance here to test out an unused gas-guzzling sedan in a car garage (called the Interview) to see whether or not you're fit to take the job. Essentially, this little one-minute test enables you to show off (or not) the skills that you'll need to master for the entire game. You'll learn the language of Driver, made up of nine essentials, the Burnout, Handbrake, Slalom, 180, 360, Reverse 180, Speed, Brake test, and Lap. (For a more thorough testing, players should also take on the several levels of the Desert, which tests drivers with slaloms, mixed asphault and dirt surfaces, slides, and accuracy.) What's ever better is the branch system that leads to varying jobs and different cars to drive.  The Physics Engine Reflections is the true master of maximizing the PlayStation's capabilities, and with the exception of Gran Turismo (which rivals Driver's physics in a different way), Driver shows off car physics like no other game available. Using cars that can be completely destroyed, Driver challenges players to learn how to drive through a high-powered car chase with skill. The cars are a bit on the heavy side, and oftentimes I wished they felt a little lighter, but the realization soon becomes clear after I encountered different cars. After all, in Driver, you're not handling a Miata, you're taking on 8-cylinder muscle cars, build before the economy days of Honda, Datsun, and Toyota.   The physics are just fantastic. Cars slide into 180s every half minute, they burn out, and they launch off the steep streets of San Francisco through the air taking on the tilt, spin, or twist with which they've launched, making landing a far more desirable skill. And they take damage, which is the gist of the whole thing. This is the first game ever when I said this to myself, ~this game was made for me,~ and ~this is what I've been waiting for.~ It fulfills driving enthusiasts' deepest desires to drive as fast as possible through major US cities and to slam into just about anything without any repercussions. In that sense, Driver is a dream come true.   Just like in DD, players will find out that their cars are destructible, but manageable in their demise. Reflections shows it clearly encourages you to smash your car around and has balanced out the level of destruction vs. reality. With the obvious exception of Survival (in which the cops are meant to be overpowered), each mission or level shows the game has been thoroughly tested and re-tested to achieve that perfect balanced feel.   And it's not just your car that takes damage, it's every car you encounter. Fly through a red light and smash the crap out of the sedan in front of you and then swing around the block and it'll be there, stalled permanently, smoking and crumpled. Players can do the same to the cops, which provides an even bigger thrill. Pass through a road block made up of five cops and watch the chasing cop total his buddies as you hit 120 mph scott-free. There are a few things that don't break down into scrap metal, and players fill soon enough find out what these obstacles are.   Still better is the way in which different surfaces alter gameplay. In Survival mode for instance, players will start out on grass. The car will burn out for a second or two before it gets traction, whilst the bastard cops start their kamikazi rampage to destroy your lovely car. Then there is dirt, which feels different than grass, and you must become accustomed to that as well. All in all, the many surfaces deepen the skill needed to master the real world cars.  Technically, Driver is one of the most accomplished games of any sort on the PlayStation, with Gran Turismo speeding right along its side. It's a marvel, to be honest. The amount of levels is way above and beyond most driving games, which have become in the last few years rather Scrooge-like. But to top off the many levels is the size of them. They're f&*king huge! By just checking out the maps, players can see how big a scope Reflections has reached for and succeeded in creating. The team has crammed this massive elephant of a game through the PlayStation's skimpy 2 megabytes of RAM bottleneck, and succeeded.   The other amazing aspect to the game's technical wizardry is that each level is played entirely different. Again, I refer back to my favorite mode, Survival. Only on SF Rush on the Nintendo 64 do players achieve that feeling of flying euphoria, where you simply never know how far up in the air you'll fly, nor how exactly you'll land. It's 50-50, and nobody can predict the outcome. In other instances, cop cars can very well launch into mid-air and then slam into one another, freeing you to achieve your goal. In perfect Keanu Reeves, all I can say is, ~woah.~  Director Mode And then there's the Director mode, which at first I thought was rather lame and secondary. Without shame, I admit I was wrong. In almost every level of the game, players can, once the level is complete, revisit the level to create a movie of it. Reflections has created a top-notch set of tools to assist your new role as a car-chase movie director, and to make it easy. The tools are a hearty set, enabling camera angles to be set anywhere, in your car, in the cop car, on the top of a building, on the ground, alongside your car, moving or still, you name it. The camera abilities are amazingly flexible and the act of re-creating your scenes is more addicting than the best of puzzle games, and more involving than the deepest of adventure titles. This completes the Reflections vision in creating a car-chase game because now you play out all of the best parts, escape the cops, and then film it. Utter driving nirvana.   So after all of this slobbering and heavy petting, what is that I don't like about the game? Very little. But to be honest, there are some bothersome areas.  1) I wish I could somehow turn my car over once it's been bashed onto its side, or upside down. I know that's not realistic, but damnit! I don't know how many times I could get away from those damn cop if only I were on my wheels. On the flip side, in many instance, cars can be smashed back onto their wheels and drive away from the incident.  2) The load times are long, and in some cases they're too long. This is me just being a bastard, but I have to at least try to be objective. I played hours and hours of the game prior to its release, and let me tell you, the final, completed game load times are much better then they were in the June or May builds, but for a final game, in 1999, they're still annoyingly long. (Still I'm happy to just play the game.)  3) While many of the glitches have been eliminated, some still exist. Oftentimes the game will simply crash. Ow, that's gotta hurt after nearly completing a level in Undercover. Driver is ambitious, and I can somehow forgive it for this because of the love I have for it, but still. I can't think of a PlayStation game in the last two years that's simply crashed in the middle of play on me. Shame on you, Reflections!  4) Once in a while the game skips, particularly in the Survival mode. You'll be playing and the game music will skip. Cars often float nearly forever, too.  5) This is a minor point, but it's worth mentioning. I prefer the over-the-shoulder perspective in most driving games. And because of this, I often get the quick change camera mode in Driver, which is startling and sometimes annoying. Because you're too close to a building, or you're underneath a something, the camera angle zooms up, and temporarily stuns you. It's a solution to a technical problem, and it works, but it's freaky and unsettling, too.  Two things: The analog control is so overly responsive that the digital feels and controls better. It's strange, but I only use the digital over analog in this game. Also, the overall menu is a little too obscure. Sometimes it's hard to deterimine which controls are which in the Director's mode and in some of the overall gameplay selections. Graphics The absolute best part of Driver is its graphic realism, and in particular its geographic attention to detail. The development team flew from dreary raining England to visit sunny Florida, California, and the hard streets of New York to film and map each of these cities in near entirety. So if you're familiar with the streets in SF or Los Angeles, you'll probably recognize the area where your favorite deli or clothing store is. Of course, company names aren't there, but their likeness is. The maps tell all, as do the SF streets, with which I'm all too familiar. Man they're steep!   Looking a lot better than, and taking a lot of its looks from, Destruction Derby, Driver blends a phenomenal amount of textures into one game. The dual use of Gourard shading and real textures is nice, and the blend of simple textures with more detailed ones is subtle but effective. The car textures are awesome, too. Each time a car is hit, the car body will change shape, but the textures wrapped around the polygons reflect the change, too.   As with its previous games, Driver's particle system ~smokes.~ (OK, bad pun.) But it really does. When car engines are smashed up badly, the engines smoke in different degrees. When an engine is really damaged, it catches on fire. Actually, this isn't a whole lot different than the DD, but it's just as cool as the first time around.   Other cool special effects worth noting are the realtime lights used in the night scenarios. They work nearly as well as in my car. Also, if you look really closely, the red lights on upcoming cars are just slightly blurred, in a subtle but good looking effect. Lens flares are a dime a dozen, and show up even in the Director mode, which is just too cool, but added to that is the amount of reflection going on from the car surfaces themselves. Specular highlighting makes these cars shine no matter what the situation.   And finally, the cars themselves. The handful of '70s cars are, shall we say, ~bitchin', dude.~ Reflections took the bad-ass muscle cars from the best of the bad old days and brought them back in accurate form, from the Starsky and Hutch mobile to the cranked up Chevys and Crystlers.   The biggest problems occur in Director's mode. Playbacks are a little choppy in thr frame rates, and can either heighten the pop-up or take on this rough effect, neither of which are that good looking. Sound Usually the sound in a game doesn't have as much affect as it does in this one. And in this phenomenally aural game, the sound effects are one of the best qualities, bar none.   First, the screeching sound of burning rubber of all of the cars is outstanding. Coupled with the high-revving sounds of the powerful engines, players fill find that they're completely compelled to peel out and rev their engines just for fun. And the sound is amazingly effective in pulling players into the game. The voices seemingly reflect the sleazy folks for whom you work, and are just short of becoming a political liability. They are stereotypes, but these are voices you would hear on TV, in a bar, or in movies. My favorite? ~Hey man, lose the tail!~   Musically, Driver once again dives deep into the best and worst of the 1970s. And unfortunately, I cannot always listen to some of the songs, which are filled with a muscley groove, backed up with flutes, heavy horns sections, and chintzy keyboards. You've got to hand it to Reflections though, the music brings you back, way back, to the sights and scenes of that time; it's accurate. To be honest, the music started off great, but as I got more into the game, the music switches from pretty bad to really good, and in both cases, it's '70s stuff. My favorite tune is the soundtrack at the game mode select. Still, when it's good, the game never sounds or feels boring.  See the Driver: The Director's Cut feature for a tutorial on the Driving mode. I like 1999 for PlayStation games. We got Street Fighter Alpha 3, R4, some great RPGs, and now one of the best driving games on any system, Driver. I warn you, the rest of this opinion is pure unbridled rant, so brace yourself.What an amazing game! Yes, I'm oozing with Driver-ness, I've been completely unavailable to my wife and I push my kid off the PlayStation minutes before his bedtime so that I can play Driver. Sex? Forget it, I've got some serious missions to complete, damnit! Get outta my baby, the car demands my attention. I'll come back to you later.What a tour-de-force! The graphics are top notch, the driving itself is unparalleled and the Director tools are unique and friendly. Aside from the little annoying and nit-picky problems of load times and glitches here and there, the overwhelming game far outweighs its little problems.  I'm once again a slave to my PlayStation, thanks to Driver.If you haven't figured it out already, the best multiplayer aspect to the game, even though this is a single-player game, is the Survival mode. It's awesome, and brings out the most radical aspects of Driver. Sheer skill, 40-foot flying cop cars bent on your destruction, pile-ups and ram-rod shots into trees are all here in this great party option. Just get about four friends around the house for a Friday night and compete for the best time. You'll kill an easy Friday night or six doing that. And then, finally, is the Director mode. How creative! How fun! How terribly addicting! I never even dreamed of a game that allowed this kind of freedom. One-hundred and twenty-eight bit Dreamcast my ass! Who needs it if it doesn't have Driver! The PlayStation lives, umbilically hooked to GT's latest masterpiece. Oh, and did I say I love this game? It's pure driving poetry.", "date": "Jul 9, 1999"}
