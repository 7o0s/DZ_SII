His style is all his own, his games are made to play in ways totally removed from what would seem normal for any other 16-bit side-scroller. It's less about action, more about exploration; less about jumping across platforms, more about swimming through caverns. The open-ended, undirected feel can be engrossing, if you're of the right mindset and willing to invest the time. But if you're looking for a more traditional game experience, you'll likely just be left frustrated and annoyed.   That's the truth of the matter for both the first Ecco adventure, and also for this game, its 1994 sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time. Well, it's sort of a sequel. Tides of Time is one of those follow-up games that really feels more like an expansion pack of extra levels than an all-new adventure. Its story picks up immediately after the events of the first game's conclusion. It's a weird plot, but it goes like this:   An ancient alien civilization called the Vortex comes to Earth every five centuries to go fishing, collecting marine creatures from Earth's oceans to feed upon for the next 500 years. Not wanting to see his family pod of dolphins become lunch for the invaders, Ecco set out on a quest to stop the harvest -- and was successful, after having traveled back in time, gained the assistance of the Earth's oldest living creature, and vanquished the sinister Vortex Queen. Tides of Time begins just as the Queen has been defeated, as Ecco is celebrates with his family -- until things get crazy all over again. Ecco's quest continues as he travels forward into the future, meets up with his advanced dolphin descendants, and fights the Vortex forces for a second time.   The concept of a common porpoise fighting extraterrestrials is almost as surreal as the gameplay itself. Ecco is a side-scroller, but not in the traditional sense -- almost every environment is underwater, so you freely swim around each level instead of jumping from place to place like other games in the genre. Ecco has the power to swim faster and faster with rapid-fire button presses, leaping out of the water and doing flips in the air to clear obstacles. He can also attack enemies with a quick rush assault under the waves, putting his bludgeoning bottlenose to good use, and can send out sonar waves that confuse enemies and provide him an echolocated map of the immediate area.   But though many of his abilities seem suited for action sequences, they're rare in Tides of Time. Exploration is what holds down the greatest percentage of play time, as you try to find the proper path through each area, and do so quickly. Ecco can't hold his breath forever, so you've only got about two minutes of dive time before you'll need to breach the surface for an oxygen refill, or find a hidden pocket of air somewhere in a cave below.   One thing that The Tides of Time does new over its prequel is that occasionally Ecco will go into some ~swim into the screen~ portal sequences, where the perspective shifts to behind the hero and you guide him forward along the Z-axis like Star Fox or Space Harrier II. These scenes break up the gameplay a bit, but are themselves pretty standard and unexciting -- you just make sure Ecco swims through the rings in the water as they appear from a distance.   And beyond that, SEGA included a few other occasions where the standard swimming takes a break, as Ecco changes shape in a few levels. Like the helicopter, car, train and mole tank sequences in Yoshi's Island, the hero here morphs into alternate forms that play differently, but don't last long; the forms being a jellyfish, shark and one of the alien Vortex warriors, among others. But also like those transformations in Yoshi's Island, the times Ecco shape-shifts play out mostly as diversions, and it's back to standard swimming in normal shape soon enough.And that's Ecco: The Tides of Time. If it sounds almost exactly like the first Ecco the Dolphin, that's because it is -- it's almost difficult to take it as a separate game, because it's essentially the same experience as what came out for the Genesis one year earlier. If you think an adventure that downplays action and promotes open-ended exploration sounds good, look into either this game or the first Ecco the Dolphin.", "date": "Jul 5, 2007"}
