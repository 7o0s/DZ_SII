The fast action of a basketball game has proven difficult to recreate on these first-stringer 3G phones, but that hasn't stopped Sorrent from stepping up to the free throw line for a shot.  Should you DL this baller, or let it cool on the bench?  Features: Two-on-two basketball action Play offense and defense First-person view Online play via Mobile Persona  FOX Sports Basketball, in interest of satisfying the white-hot curiosity our opener no doubt caused, is a surprisingly fun little baller.  While it certainly doesn't possess the deep game of NBA2K3, it offers a tight arcade experience that will serve any sports fan with a spare five minutes well.  FOX Sports Basketball is played in two parts: offense and defense.  Start out with the ball for a hard fought few minutes of baskets, as you decide whether or not to punish the defense with an unblockable three or embarrass them with your skillful barrage of masterful dunks.  Most impressive of all, though, is lobbing the ball to your center and watching them shatter the glass.  Of course, the computer won't make this easy for you.  He'll be all up in your grill, trying to bat that ball away with some hot D.  After the half, switch to defense and keep your opponent from humiliating you like you did him in the first minutes of the game.  However, in FOX Sports Basketball, blocking the ball can also earn you points.  Nimbly use the touchpad to follow your opponent around the perimeter and block threes, or stop him for going through the paint for a monster dunk.  The game is controlled completely from the touchpad.  No need to take your thumb off or try to position a second mitts on your ever-decreasing handset's footprint.  While jumping, tap up to fake out the defense, then hold it up to put up a shot.  FOX Sports Basketball also uses what Sorrent calls a Mobile Persona.  You play as the same baller every game, using hard-earned stat points to beef up skills.  With a maxed-out player, you'll have little trouble steamrolling the competition in later games.  You can also wade online and play other MPs, which increase FOX Sports Basketball's shelflife, tenfold.  The game looks pretty solid, no matter what handset you DL it for.  On the Sanyo SCP-8100, the colors were bright and player model well-detailed.  Check out how sweet player faces look.  Too bad Sorrent wasn't able to secure NBA likenesses, though.  Animations are fairly smooth -- not quite GBA level, but they'll do on a celly game.Wowza, first a good boxing game, not a fun basketball title.  Could sports game be experiencing some glory days on these new handsets?  Sorrent's baller is a fun, addictive game that will entertain more than fans of the NBA.  It's a great pick-up-and-play title with easy controls that should appeal to anybody looking for a good game for their new cellphone.  FOX would be wise to continue their reltionship with Sorrent, as FOX Sports could become the de facto sports brand on handsets, just like EA Sports is the brand to beat on consoles.", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
