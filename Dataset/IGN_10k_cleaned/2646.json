{"name": "Deus Ex", "name_review": "Deus Ex: The Conspiracy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/01/deus-ex-the-conspiracy", "text": "At this stage of the race, chances are good that you've already heard of a first-person RPG by the name of ~Deus Ex~ in some form or another. Pronounced ~Day-uhs Ecks,~ this game was first brought to life as a mouse-and-keyboard shooter nearly two years ago on the PC and has since made the transition to the PS2 scene at the beginning of April 2002.    The fine people at Eidos/Ion Storm have received critical acclaim for the many iterations of this software across all platforms, and with good reason.  Deus Ex takes a fresh look at the FPS genre and attempts to infuse it with various gameplay elements akin to such genres as ~adventure~ and ~RPG.~     In fact, it becomes hard to slap the generic FPS label on this title because it strays so nicely from the typical Quake-style frag-fest the genre is stereotypically known for. Although mission-based and story-driven elements are nothing new, Deus Ex delves into a few new ideas that indicate the good things to come in the future of FPS gaming.   For those just now tuning into the two-year history of the title, the following words have probably already been used in a variety of Deus Ex (DX) descriptive paragraphs: dark, future, conspiracy, technology, cyborg, assassin, top-secret government, and yes -- The Matrix.  The DX style is one that the entertainment industry is repeatedly drawn to, if for no other reason than the fact that we (the consumers) seem to have an insatiable appetite for this trench-coat-and-sunglasses realm of fantasy.    But despite its similarities to other previous blockbuster movies, this return to an apocalyptic future near you manages to feel somewhat new and unique at the same time.   Story  The story unfolds in a futuristic America, where disease and poverty afflict the majority while the privileged few live like fat little piggies with their vast riches and vaccines.  Enter our hero: a moderately built Hugh Jackman borrowing Neo's trench coat, Tom Cruise's sun glasses, and Solid Snake's voice.  You go by the name of J.C. Denton, a rookie agent in the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) and recently assigned to counter terrorist efforts by the National Secessionist Force (NSF).  These acronyms will soon become a prominent fixture of the narrative, as you're sure to run into them with every book you read and character you meet.      The game features an impressive sum of background and supplemental story in such forms: newspapers, magazines, non-playable characters, signs, and computer terminals.  While you can usually skip such little gems and progress toward the completion of your primary mission objectives, it's these interesting details that serve well to create the illusion of a rich world that exists around you, defining your relationship with the story.  In fact, there are even alternate story paths players will inadvertently choose for themselves based on these little interactions early in the game.  And like any good futuristic thriller, you can be sure to question the allegiance of your friends and foes throughout the lengthy gameplay experience.   Gameplay  Generally speaking, the vast majority of FPS titles lean more toward the ~shooter~ side of the fence than anything else. A typical FPS experience is limited to the ~kill them all~ approach, and the circle of life is kept complete as you snag the extra clips of ammunition from the littered corpses.  But two years ago, Ion Storm constructed a new first-person experience that clashes with the shooter mold of previous titles.  Sure, you still strafe with the left analog stick and look via the right analog stick.  And yes, you collect weapons, ammunition, items, and med-kits from the slain bodies of your victims.   Had the concept halted there, it would sit perfectly next to such titles as Quake III.  Now toss in the all-important non-playable characters (NPCs), story, plot, and primary/secondary mission objectives.  About half the FPS titles on the market also tout such sophisticated features to create a more vivid cinematic experience and pull the player even deeper into its world.  But DX goes even further.   One of the first big differences you'll spot is the ability to build up a character as you progress through the game.  This concept has kept RPG gamers hooked since the dawn of the pixel, and it's about time someone thought it well to bring it into the first-person perspective.  DX enables your abilities to be enhanced in multiple ways, including added character skills, weapon enhancements, and biomechanical upgrades called ~augmentations.~  Without venturing too far into the intricacies of exactly how this system works, suffice to say it works very well.    Players will both earn and discover such upgrades depending on their relative success in the game and are then free to upgrade their abilities however they see fit.  One person may choose to become a technical wizard by maxing-out his hacking and lockpicking skills, while another may choose the sharpshooter route with additional stealth gear and aiming augmentations.  Like all good RPG titles, the player instantly becomes attached to his personalized character in the game and the customization factor weighs heavily into the fun.   Items also play a key role, with fairly complex and intuitive inventory menus at your disposal and a large selection of gear to pack into them.  In fact, DX requires gamers to keep track of a healthy selection of Bond-style gadgets and gizmos including binoculars, grenades, pistols, rifles, crossbows, and melee weapons.  And each can be customized and upgraded throughout the game -- a scope can be purchased from any number of underworld vendors, then allowing the player to decide whether to slap it on their 30.06 rifle or semi-automatic sidearm.  While items and gadgets are certainly nothing new to the shooter crowd, the ability to upgrade and organize your stash again rings true of the RPG inventory management techniques, and it works very well to enhance the gameplay.   There's also plenty of environmental objects to manipulate during your conspiracy quest -- imagine investigating and interacting with countless world items: boxes, plants, pots, switches, control panels, books, chairs, lights, coke machines, toilets, trash bags -- all rendered in DX for you to grab, carry, place, climb onto, open, read, talk to, or break.  And it works as more than a simple novelty, as you'll often require the assistance of a strategically placed metal box to gain leverage to an out-of-reach platform or item.  This, in conjunction with the upgrade and inventory systems, really give DX's gameplay a depth that truly puts the average FPS into shallow water by comparison.   Now despite these creative gameplay elements, the title is certainly not without its flaws.  The control is a mixed bag, where some are turned off completely and others have no problems adapting after a quick run through the training missions (which, by the way, are fairly helpful).  Occasionally you'll be treated to a special moonwalk by one of the agitated guards -- a forward-running guard that is slowly drifting backwards for no apparent reason at all.  This always makes for an amusing headshot with the sniper rifle.      And sadly, the enemy AI can fall flat on its face in some parts, with guards behaving in a painfully scripted manner as they run their square corners around pillars and completely ignore your oncoming death blows. Disappointing, yes, but also easily forgivable once the character-building elements of the gameplay really sink their teeth into you.   Graphics  And now: The not-so-forgivable part. It seems as though the ancient gods of gaming have a cruel sense of irony, as this highly creative FPS title also ships with a less than impressive visual package.  At this point in the software timeline, PS2 gamers have already been treated to several other polished shooters such as Half-Life and Red Faction -- both of which graphically leave DX in the dust.  But even without the comparison, most graphic elements found in DX are noticeably lacking.   Texture quality is perhaps the biggest eyesore of the bunch, with a hefty amount of blurring and dithering smeared onto everything from terrain, to objects, and to characters.  Granted, it's not entirely fair to compare this PS2 version with it's PC brother (despite the two-year difference) due to hardware differences, but having seen what other developers have already achieved on the PS2 leaves DX looking a bland at best.  It could have been worse, but there's definitely nothing to brag about here.    On the side of redemption, the frame rate is barely acceptable and keeps the game playable throughout.  It clearly stutters and chokes in some of the larger outdoor levels, but once indoors it scrolls along smoothly enough.  However, as mentioned before, one can't help but feel as though the developers simply didn't invest enough resources into tuning and polishing the title to the graphical finesse it deserved.    With a game design this tight, Deus Ex could have easily been the killer FPS title on PS2, but instead is left in the middle of the pack with a mediocre visual package that will unfortunately detract from the experience for many gamers.   Sound  Like any good shooter, the guns in Deus Ex go ~bang~ and the bad guys always scream in pain appropriately when dropping to the earth. The sound effects are crystal clear and right on cue, and the occasional techno music track is placed tastefully into the mix to keep the pace rolling along.  For the most part, the DX audio department is solid and, in fact, even shines when the characters step up to the mike to read the well-written Hollywood-esque script.     The in-game cut scenes and character dialog are very nicely done here, featuring great voice acting and tons of pre-recorded snippets of dialog for each character. Talking to the same character repeatedly will soon become a favorite pastime for many once they discover that each is packing at least six-10 layers of audio commentary, ranging from important plot-driven tips to comical asides.  Thus the sound design is right on par with the gameplay fundamentals -- both are quality components that complement each other nicely.I'm a sucker for a good FPS game any day of the week, so it's really hard for me not to enjoy Deus Ex on PS2.  The game is highly creative and does wonderful things with the genre that no other console game has really experimented with to this degree. The character customizations and well-conceived storytelling aspects of the title alone are well worth the time of any PS2 gamer looking for a shooter with both action and depth.  But much like watching 20-hour a movie through a slice of clear Jell-O, this title can also be a little tough on the old peepers over time. Those willing to overlook the graphical shortcomings will adjust to the sensation both quickly and painlessly, but for the rest of us who expect more from a PS2 title -- at times it's just too bland to keep your senses sufficiently stimulated. With a gameplay backbone this tightly wound, it truly pains me to see such potential not given the absolute best look possible on the system.  But on the plus side, I'm excited to think that the talented folks at Ion Storm may take a serious look at efficiently harnessing the graphical power of the PS2 for the inevitable sequel -- a truly exciting thought.  In the meantime, those even slightly interested in Deus Ex on the PS2 (and those unfamiliar with the previous PC version) should not hesitate to give it a very well deserved chance to impress you with its creativity.", "date": "May 1, 2002"}
