The same old hound, again and again, coming into the office for yet another check-up or vaccinating shot. Maybe he's got a different name each time, sure  but you know the truth. It's all the same dog.   The problem with some past veterinarian sims on the DS has been exactly that  that the same animals show up again and again, with the same 3D models and the same 2D sprites. It's a lack of variety in the patients that takes away from the experience of pretending to be an animal doctor. And it's a lack of variety that, thankfully, you won't experience in Pet Pals: Animal Doctor. This new pet vet design from Majesco finally introduces a significant array of different kinds of animals for aspiring diagnosticians to examine and cure, including exotic species like tropical birds, turtles, fish and giant snakes. It's not the same old dog any more, and that's worth a sigh of relief.   Pet Pals: Animal Doctor follows in the conceptual footsteps of past DS releases like Paws & Claws: Pet Vet and Imagine: Animal Doctor, and places players in the role of a young veterinarian just getting started at a brand new practice.  Virtual owners of virtual pets come into the office waiting room, and you admit and examine their animals one at a time on your way to the ultimate goal of seeing that every patient's seen and treated.    The gameplay gets going once you make your way into the examination room here, which is a bit of a shift in focus from past pet vet games on DS  those others have spent at least some time and effort on having you manage the business of running your office, including buying food and medicine, keeping track of money and getting payment from customers. Pet Pals: Animal Doctor doesn't have any of that. In this one, it's all about the animals.   One of Pet Pals: Animal Doctor's main draws is its unmatched variety of species, including giant snakes.  And all about what's wrong with the animals, as each one arrives with a different medical mystery in tow. As the lead doctor, you'll first question the animal's owner about what they've seen or observed and why they brought their pet in to be examined in the first place  sometimes their answers are helpful, and sometimes they're a waste of time. The dialogue is written well and conveys the reality that while some pet owners are knowledgeable, others don't know what they're doing and probably should never have been allowed to adopt a pet in the first place.   Then, after the question round, you'll begin a series of tests and treatments that activate simple touch screen interactions. Using the magnifying glass to get a closer look at an animal is achieved by dragging the stylus across a set path laid out on the screen. Listening to a creature's heart with a stethoscope or examining its skin with a glove becomes a quick tapping exercise where you're tasked to hit small circles on the screen with accurate stylus stabs. Drawing blood and injecting medicine is done by sliding a syringe meter up and down, and more. The implementations are all simple and accessible, and while missing the mark in any of these activities will cause your current patient to get irritable, it's not a common occurrence that you'll fail the exam because of that.   The fact that the progression from one task to another in the exam room is so simple is what makes Pet Pals: Animal Doctor compelling. You're not rushed for time here, as you're encouraged to be accurate rather than fast  it makes for a calming and interesting play experience, as you also get to read explanations of what's happening with each test on the top screen as you complete your work on the bottom. It's educational and feels like it must be very close to what a real veterinarian goes through in real examinations.   Pet Pals' visuals are unique, too. The earlier observation that the game offers a wide variety of animals holds true, but the way you get to observe these creatures is even more interesting  rather than render out each one in active, animated 3D form, the game instead employs a fairly static style of still shots. Your camera moves to fixed viewpoints around each animal as you look at the face, or chest, or paws and the patient always stays perfectly still on the table  it's closer to medical games like Trauma Center than it is the other pet vet titles on DS. The lack of much movement can be a little odd, but ultimately adds to the calming, slow-paced style of play that the gameplay sets up.   If there's a real negative that holds Pet Pals: Animal Doctor back in the end, it's that there doesn't end up being much depth in the package outside of the core gameplay in the examination rooms. There's a Recovery Room in your practice that you can visit to take care of patients that are staying overnight, but the activities there are basic and completed in mere seconds. There are a couple of extra mini-games, too, but those are also shallow  a simple memory matching game, a standard sliding block puzzle and the like.So don't look for Pet Pals: Animal Doctor to be a deep and engaging experience outside of its core focus, which is completing accurate, educational examinations on a variety of different animals. But if that concept appeals to you, definitely consider investing the budget-level amount of 20 bucks to check this one out. It's compelling that it offers such a wide variety of different animals to see and help, after other competing pet vet games have presented nothing but the same old dogs, cats and horses for the past few years on DS. And it's a calming, easy-to-play experience all around that won't frustrate anyone, even the very newest aspiring animal doctors.", "date": "Feb 19, 2008"}
