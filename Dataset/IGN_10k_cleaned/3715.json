Bethesda's fantastic roleplaying game packs more content in to a single package than you're likely to find in the entire series of most other franchises. Nevertheless, the folks at Bethesda know a good thing when they see one and have graciously consented to offer up even more experiences for the legions of Morrowind junkies out there, myself among them.  The latest expansion is titled Bloodmoon and offers a nice change of pace from the gritty, ashy surroundings of most of Vvardenfell. Set in a world of tribal mythology drawn liberally but authentically from primarily Norse and Celtic sources, Bloodmoon is sort of like Morrowind meets an Icelandic saga meets Beowulf. Magical animals factor heavily in some sequences of the story, as do the large mystical megaliths you stumble across from time to time.  The chance to visit the island setting of Solstheim where Bloodmoon takes place becomes available immediately once you start the game. The characters in Morrowind are all seemingly hip to some morale problems at an Imperial Legion fort located on Solstheim. After your arrival things go even more wrong for the legionnaires (though it's not necessarily your doing). In fact, things are wrong pretty much all over Solstheim. What with dudes lying dead in the snow or locked up in some mead hall or simply standing around in fuzzy underwear.  Your first adventure in Solstheim is literally right around the corner from your jump off point. But after that the main quest requires you to explore the entire breadth of the island pretty much right away. The lack of quests that carry you progressively and incrementally farther away from your starting point isn't much of a problem for higher level (25+) characters but can be a real struggle for weaker adventurers. Along the way to this second quest you're likely to run in to a number of side quests that, while not tying in to the main quest, nevertheless provide an added bit of substance to the world. One significant multi-part side quest involves the creation of a new trading company on the island. By itself it offers the largest, non-core adventure in the expansion. Rather than just being a mere diversion, these quests actually carry some significant rewards (not least of which is that you might have a new place to trade in all your loot).  After the cramped urban setting of Tribunal I was glad to return to the more open-ended adventuring available in Bloodmoon. I was also glad that I had a high-enough level character to take on the challenges of the new game. Though we've heard from Bethesda that it's possible for a starting player to take on these new challenges, I'd be hard pressed to say it would be more fun or rewarding for them than it is for characters who already passed level 20.  Like Tribunal, Bloodmoon offers a much more focused experience for players and you'll likely stick with the expansion until you've exhausted almost all its resources. Though Solstheim is largely self-contained and holds nearly everythinga good adventure might need (at least in the short term), you may have to interrupt your adventuring to head back to the main continent. Traveling back and forth to your main bases on Vvardenfell can be a bit tricky Intervention and Recall spells or potions will come in very handy here. There are a few instances where events or encounters on Solstheim tie in to the larger continent but, for the most part, these two lands have very little to do with each other.  The expansion also provides plenty of new enemies. The low end boars and wolves aren't particularly bad by themselves. What makes them dangerous is that they're now more likely to attack in groups. This new notion of cooperation even extends to some of the higher level monsters you'll face in Bloodmoon. Taking down a boar might not be all that difficult. Taking down five is. In addition to those, there are also gaunt spriggans (who need to be killed three times before they die), impish ricklings and a few other surprises to be had.  Strangely (and thankfully) Bloodmoon doesn't include any flying creatures. None that we've found at least. There is a cliff racer corpse in one of the mead halls you'll visit, but even after exploring for days, we've yet to run across a single flying enemy. Things are equally safe in the water. The only seaborne creature you encounter is pretty passive which is a big plus considering the number of times a quest is located in some sort of underwater cave.    Bloodmoon also adds werewolves and though they're formidable opponents, the real attraction here is that you can actually become a werewolf yourself. Long-requested by fans of Daggerfall, where it played a big role, Bethesda has finally brought them to the latest title in the series. While I was pretty excited to play as the werewolf, it didn't quite meet my expectations. And that's a good thing. Where I expected to easily overpower most enemies, I found that werewolves have to rely on intelligence more than force. Given that most of the inhabitants of the world have some kind of silver weapon (which does a ton of damage to werewolves) you'll have to rely on sneakily hunting around until you catch someone standing out in the snow all by themselves. Interestingly, lycanthropy is much more closely tied to the main quest than vampirism was in the previous games. Sure, there were vampire missions, but Bloodmoon's main quest gets you tantalizingly close to baying at the moon.  But though lycanthropy is more a part of the main quest, it makes it incredibly difficult to do the things you normally do. Should anyone see you change form, you'll forever be labeled a werewolf by every NPC in the game, no matter how far away they are. Presumably they're using the same form of communication that allows an Argonian carpenter to have so much knowledge of the morale conditions at an Imperial Legion fort on a small island on the other side of the continent. You'll still function like normal during the day and you'll still get the same reactions from people (unlike with vampirism). But once night falls you'll have no access to skills, spells or inventory items and you'll have to rely on the werewolf's enhanced fighting, speed and jumping ability to get the job done. Additionally a werewolf will have to kill one NPC per night to sate their bloodlust.  Provided you have the system to run it, Bloodmoon is a graphical treat. Where most everything in Morrowind was covered in thin layer of ash, most everything in Bloodmoon is covered in a thin layer of snow. The snow-shrouded forests of Solstheim provide a welcome change of pace. Hills and trees cover pretty much every square inch of land here, sealing off the small islands of humanity with a vast wilderness. Large stones stand here and there on the island, reinforcing the Celtic flavor of the world, while frozen lakes remind you that sometimes you don't need a spell to walk on water. The weather effects can be quite overwhelming, both in terms of their impact on your eyes and your PC. The particles build up to a virtual blizzard and while it makes a fantastic visual and convinces you that this is a real world, it can seriously hamper your framerate.  Things are less improved in terms of sound. The music and effects are pretty much exactly like they were in Morrowind. There is a bit of new recorded dialogue here and many lines are delivered according to context. Hearing a guy start muttering because I still haven't completed his quest was an unexpected (but ultimately infrequent) treat. Since Bloodmoon only contains monsters new to the expansion, you'll find yourself hearing the same monster sounds over and over again. I can't tell you how many people stopped by my desk to see what that stupid pig sound was. What did you think of Bloodmoon?   Those of you who don't already have Tribunal installed will find a few new features in Bloodmoon. A new quest log lets you highlight those quests that haven't yet been completed and a new annotation tool has been added to the game's map. But Bloodmoon fails to address the basic performance and stability problems that occasionally frustrate players. The new outdoor setting and the burdensome (but beautiful) snow effects help bring the framerate down even further and the odd crash bugs still manage to find their way to the surface at the most inopportune times. ~Save early, save often~ should be your motto.Bethesda's offered up a really nice treat to Morrowind fans. Though I liked Tribunal alright, it seemed to change the overall approach of the main game a bit too much for my liking. Bloodmoon makes its own changes to the game, of course, but rather than changing the overall thrust of the game, it merely adds a brand new area (complete with plenty of story elements) in which you partake in the kinds of things that made Morrowind so fun to begin with. I finished the main story of Bloodmoon in a few days but there's much more to be discovered lurking about in the corners of the expansion.", "date": "Jun 17, 2003"}
