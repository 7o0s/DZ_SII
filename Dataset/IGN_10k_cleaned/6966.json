Back then, the once mighty console fighting lineup was rapidly diluted with one formulaic brawler after the other. Sadly, the trend pretty much continued on N64, a console that still doesn't have a worthy contender against PlayStation's Tekken series and Sega's Virtua Fighters. War Gods, Mace, Dark Rift, Bio Freaks... Games became more realistic looking and more bloody, but their designers did little to move the genre forward.After this long intro, you're probably expecting us to tell you ~but now, there's this new game that gets it right.~ Unfortunately, there is still not fairytale ending. While Culture Brain's Flying Dragon, known as Hiryu no Ken: Twin in Japan, comes up with a number of exciting innovations -- the fighting engine and execution just don't cut it.GameplayReleased in Japan in December of '97, Natsume has decided to take the gamble and bring Culture Brain's fighter to the US. Marketed as a two games in one, Flying Dragon includes almost 20 playable characters (not counting hidden ones) in two completely different game modes.The two basic modes enable you to either select from a squat crew of cutesy fighters, or the slightly different lineup of tall, realistic fighters. As with most games, Flying Dragon's fighters are well-versed in a variety of fighting styles, including kung-fu, karate and wrestling. Although the SD mode is supposed to offer a more ~arcade~ style of gaming, both play styles are fairly similar. The fighting engine boasts multiple combos, throws, kicks, punches and projectiles. The special moves include throws and multiple kicks, as well as projectile attacks that freeze the action on screen for a moment.Unfortunately, the game feels much too slow and unresponsive. I just isn't that fun to play. On the positive side, Flying Dragon incorporates a number of innovations that we'd love to see in a game with a better engine. For example, the SD mode offers the ability to fight opponents and win items. These power-ups can be equipped RPG-style and open up new moves, new powers, or even new difficulty modes. There are almost 200 different items to uncover, which gives the game and immense amount of replay value.In the more realistic mode, you select from two different playstyles, 2D or 3D. The 2D mode still shows the action in 3D polygons, but you can't sidestep your opponents. The 3D mode is more in the line of Mace or Fighter's Destiny. Evade your opponent and try to grab or kick him from all sides. There are countless special moves and counter attacks that, for example, intercept someone's kick, hold the leg and throw him to the ground. You can even get a hold of fighters when they're down on the floor and bend their limbs a bit, wrestling style.The number of options available is exemplary. Select from Circuit Mode, Vs Mode, Tournament, or Group Battle, and collect items or compete for ranks. In addition to the ability to customize rules and gameplay settings, Flying Dragon also offers an excellent practice mode that shows players their opponents' weak spots (there is even an item that opens up this ability in the one player mode).Sadly, all these wonderful features can't save the game from mediocrity. Sluggish controls, choppy graphics, and a lack of excitement keep this game from appealing to the masses.GraphicsFlying Dragon is improved in many areas over its Japanese counterpart, as Natsume took the time to clean up the backgrounds and brighten up the colors. The artwork has a nice anime feel to it, although the characters aren't the most original bunch to appear in a fighting game -- well, except for the mechanical sumo... During gameplay, the polygonal characters are low in detail, the backgrounds are flat and low-res and there is still a fair amount of dithering going on. But the game's main flaw in the graphics department is also one that directly affects gameplay. Despite the low detail, the game runs at often jerky framerates. Considering that fighting is supposed to rely on quick reflexes, the slowdown is simply unacceptable.SoundAll the voices and war cries are left in Japanese, which is nice, but there just isn't enough to give the game its own character. The score is typical Japanese fighting game music, ranging from Japanese koto tunes to midi rock. Not terrible, but not memorable, either.It's depressing that developer Culture Brain has all these great ideas, but not enough technical know-how to make a good game out of them. I like the ability to customize the tournaments and the game definitely scores some brownie points with us for trying something new, but what good are these features when the game engine can't keep up? Hopefully, some fighting game developers out there will look at Flying Dragon and be inspired to add an item system to their titles as well. Imagine a game in the Tekken style with the ability to earn new body armor, new weapons, or upgrade the characters RPG-style.", "date": "Feb 5, 1999"}
