Not just a wry smile either, but properly laugh out loud. It's packed with off-the-wall humour that really brings the game to life and this playfulness is as much a part of the experience as, say, the crazy gun-slinging we've spoken about at length in our previous looks at the game. Take the opening cinematic for example - unlikely hero Ram stops by his Dad's office to drop off his birthday present, only to witness a combine harvester crashing through the wall and mincing his pop to pieces. When it turns out the local drug cartel is behind the murder, Ram vows to exact revenge for his departed dad, and so begins a trail of destruction that stretches from the backwaters of deepest Mexico to the crime-infested streets where the local mob kingpin is hiding out.   Chili Con Carnage has four game modes, two single-player and two multiplayer, with El Gringo Roco providing the main one-player meat of the game. It's worth noting at this point that despite visual similarities between Chili and GTA - a lot of the bizarre characters that run around Eidos's shooter wouldn't be out of place in a Rockstar game - the two couldn't be more dissimilar to play. Rather than serving up a free-roaming world, Chili Con Carnage sticks to a more linear storyline and is structured as a series of bite-sized levels you must complete to unlock the next. In this sense it has a lot more in common with a traditional shoot-'em-up, with players gunning down the enemy with an increasingly powerful arsenal of weapons and grabbing power-ups to dish out mega-death.    And carnage is what Chili is all about. Although there are various objectives to achieve throughout each level, whether it's to destroy three enemy silos or escape from a sinking ship, most of the game is simple spent shooting Mexican bad asses with an assortment of weapons, from puny pistols to lethal machineguns. Wipe out all the enemies in one area of the game and you're free to move onto the next, where you must massacre the next lot and so on. It's not particularly clever but then neither is Gears of War, plus there's much more to Chili than easy kills and blasting through the levels as quickly as possible.   You see, while killing is crucial in Chili, killing with style is far more important. Why take down an enemy with a bullet to the chest when you can pop a cap in their head while flipping through the air? Pulling off spectacular kills is key to getting the most out of the game, because the more impressive the attack the bigger the reward. As such, while a simple headshot rewards a respectable amount of points, that number is doubled if you do the same shot while diving through the air and twisting through 180-degrees. Likewise, execute the same stylish move while wearing a sombrero and you get even more points.    Your combo multiplyer increases with every bad guy you kill, so bag a dozen in a row and your score multiplies by 12. You have a few seconds to ensure the kill-a-thon continues too, because the combo meter drains slowly to allow you enough time to leg it to the next area and squeeze before the bonus runs out completely. And that's where Chili really comes into its own - players can romp through to the end, completing objectives with the minimum of effort and style, but that's not really the point. It's just as much about notching up the highest score possible as it is getting to the end, if not more so.     In that respect, what's clever about Chili is that the levels have been designed to encourage you to use your imagination and create the biggest combos possible. In fact if you're really good you can get through each level from start to finish in one long killing spree, because enemies have been placed so that you can keep your combo going indefinitely. Of course it's not easy, but it'll certainly keep score whores coming back for more.   However, there isn't really much of an incentive to replay levels and become that good at the game, other than to brag about your high score to friends. You're not awarded with anything particularly special for stringing together the mother of all combos, which is a bit of a missed opportunity in our opinion.    Having said that, there is a point to completing the challenge levels that are dotted throughout the main game, even though completing them isn't compulsory. These brief diversions require you to master specific moves within strict time and enemy limits, so you're forced to learn the moves that bring in the big points - which you can then carry on over into the main single-player game. More importantly, successfully completing the challenges unlocks extras in the multiplayer game, including different arenas and playable characters.   Ah yes, the multiplayer modes. There are two to choose from, Hangman and Fiesta, but the aim of each is pretty much the same - to get the highest score possible. In Fiesta you compete wirelessly against up to three other players, fighting across the same level but not against each other. Instead you throw enemies on your opponents' screens, making it harder for them to survive. Power-ups spice up the multiplayer game, with combo and weapon stealers improving your chance of winning and screen-flippers turning the game on its head - literally. Hangman is more of the same but is played on a single PSP, with pieces of Hangman gallows awarded to the player with the lowest score.    The multiplayer games are fun, especially if you're competing against players of a similar skill level, but once you've been playing it for a couple of hours you can't help but feel you've seen everything the game has to offer - which can be said of Chili Con Carnage overall. Don't get us wrong, we love the game's superb sense of humour and wracking up spectacular kills is a lot of fun, but there just isn't enough variety from one level to the next, both in terms of gameplay and visual style. The challenge and boss stages - in which you fight all manner of screwed-up enemies - inject some diversity, but these levels are few and far between, so you really will spend most of the game pulling off the same moves and combos unless you really push yourself to try something different.We like Chili Con Carnage, but not quite as much as we expected to. Visually its sharp and stylish and, as weve said countless times already, the humour really makes the game stand out. The controls, too, are refreshingly responsive, so mastering diving headshots and wall-climb kills quickly becomes second nature. But while we love the bits that Chili does well, we cant help but feel a little short-changed when it comes to variety, in both the main game and the different modes. True, you can replay through levels to get the highest score possible, but when theres little incentive to do so whats the point? Weve no doubt that you'll have a lot of fun with Chili Con Carnage, its just that it could have been a fantastic game instead of a good one.", "date": "Feb 12, 2007"}
