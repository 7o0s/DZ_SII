While other titles have had a head start, Acclaim has definitely poured its hearts into its innitial entry -- and it shows. NHL Breakaway '98 boasts high-res polygons that look and move exceptionally well. Not only can you see the jersey numbers on their sleeves, but if you edit a player, the name and number will appear on the player's back. Putting yourself in the game always makes it more appealing. Besides, knocking around with the best players in the NHL without getting a scratch is always fun.  Looking past the graphics, NHL Breakaway '98 possesses one of the most innovative features ever to appear in a hockey game: the Momentum Based Checking System. Players can actually out-skate and out-muscle each other, depending on a player's size and speed. For example, some players may be smaller but they can move faster, others may be slow, but possess the strength and size to plow through the guppies. For instance, if a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving quickly enough, the power behind his check is greater than what a smaller player could generate.  The game itself plays well. Players move exceptionally fast and the slap-shots are fast and true to the ice. Passing tends to be a little inaccuarate at times, but overall, the gameplay is above average.  NHL Breakaway '98 may not break or surpass any new boundaries, but it's definitely a good game and shouldn't be overlooked.  PSX Staff", "date": "Sep 11, 1997"}
