Or so Atlus Software would have you believe in its latest MegaTen spin-off, Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga.   Well okay, so maybe the similarities aren't that blatant, but there are still enough common threads here to remind Zanarkand vets of what would happen if they mixed Tidus' bittersweet adventure with the disturbing atmosphere of last September's Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. In fact, Digital Devil Saga holds enough similarities to those two titles to almost make it a missing link of sorts -- the kind of game that would bridge two completely different products with two completely different philosophies without ever surpassing the quality of either.   If Saga were to resemble one of its influences most in terms of presentation, though, it would undoubtedly be the much spookier Nocturne. Benefiting from the distinctive talents of renowned Japanese artist Kazuma Kaneko (Persona, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner), Digital Devil has one of the most unique visual styles around. Combining the familiar post-apocalyptic base of movies like Akira and Ghost in the Shell with the techno-organic look of Evangelion, Digital Devil Saga offers quite a spectacular and callous look at the far-off future. Its union of grays, pales, and the occasional neon light is quite striking, and when combined with its primitive but militaristic character designs, makes an impressive overall package.   But this kind of stylistic approach only makes sense considering the type of story that Atlus wants to tell. Set in a world known as ~The Junkyard,~ Digital Devil Saga follows a young tribal leader named Serph as he leads his people towards a (hopefully) brighter future. As Commander of the Embryon Clan and all around mysterious guy, Serph has been battling alongside his crew in a never-ending struggle against five other tribes for years. Up until now, however, the conflict has remained a total stalemate with all six sides separated by a neutral entity. But then one day without warning that balance comes crashing down. Amidst a skirmish with the neighboring Vanguard Clan, Serph and his teammates discover a puzzling bio-organism in the middle of the battlefield. In the blink of an eye, a great light from the heavens strikes the pulsating object and causes it to explode into thousands of parasitic beams that strike every last person on the planet. A few moments later, all hell breaks loose when the soldiers transform into demons and begin consuming each other like it's all you can eat shrimp night at Red Lobster.   No matter where Serph goes, sunshine doesn't follow. From that moment on, Digital Devil Saga essentially becomes the story of the Embryons and their mission to systematically annihilate other tribes so that they can enter Nirvana -- a beautiful utopia where all their wildest dreams can come true. Unfortunately the other clans want the same exact thing and when a mysterious black-haired woman named Sera arrives on the scene to help, all the warring factions want to get their hands on her too (especially since she's the only one that can calm the transformed demons with just the sound of her voice). It's a pretty intriguing story to say the least, and it has a rather surprising amount of religious iconography and reference material (just like Nocturne did before it).   There's even a limited amount of branching thrown in for good measure and based on how you answer questions and react to certain situations, the narrative sees a couple of changes. I am a bit bummed, however, that the ratio of plot to combat is rather thin -- because as intriguing as the storyline is it would have been great to get a lot more of out it. Had the tale been given additional face time, it could potentially have been one of the best yarns of the year. But given the fact that the first installment ends on a cliffhanger that won't be resolved until Digital Devil Saga 2, there's still enough time to see what happens.   But combat is what Digital Devil Saga is really all about anyway, and if you've played through Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne before, then this game should feel pretty familiar. Working on the same turn-based formula that powered Nocturne, DDS utilizes a three-character combat setup with the innovative press turn system that rewards players for smart tactics. What this means is that if you're intelligent about the kinds of strikes you perform on an enemy (an ice spell on a fire creature, for example), you'll earn an extra move for that round before it's your opponent's turn. This feature plays really heavily into battle strategy and encourages you to experiment with the different kinds of attacks at your disposal. And thanks to the typically high encounter ratio that the MegaTen games are so well known for, you'll have plenty of opportunities to do so.    RPG veterans may find the early combat in Digital Devil Saga a little on the easy side, though, as the game's entire first half is a bit of a pushover when it comes to difficulty. Luckily the second half of the game really pours it on and regardless of how well you may have leveled up your characters prior to that, it'll definitely pose a challenge. This is certainly one of the strongest aspects of Digital Devil Saga, as the designers have done a great job of easing players into the game without piling everything on top of them at once. If there was a single overwhelming complaint that casual role-players had with Nocturne last year, it was that it threw the somewhat complicated leveling system at them with very little warning. Digital Devil Saga has been severely dumbed down in comparison.   And that's where the game's resemblances to Final Fantasy X comes into play. Instead of having to worry about upgrading your arsenal of demons like you did in Nocturne, Digital Devil Saga uses a simplistic sphere grid system that enables characters to earn hundreds of different powers and abilities by eating their opposition. You can then use the energy from your consumed opponents to power-up your mantra and then repeat the process all over again. It's an addictive little system and it's good to see that a game other than FFX has finally used it. You'll really need to use those powers too, because the AI of a lot of these enemies can get pretty brutal.   As fun and clever as the battle system may be, however, it gets too repetitive for its own good. Almost every dungeon in the Junkyard is epic in size, and it can take hours to go through just one of them in order to move the story along. Toss in a couple of door and switch puzzles, the previously mentioned high encounter rate, and boss battles that can end up heavy in ~trial and error~ town, and Digital Devil Saga eventually begins to feel like its dragging along -- especially when you consider how little story you get in exchange for your combat. And as I said before, that's really unfortunate since the story is really good when it happens.   There are a couple of other small concerns I have as well. The camera system, for example, isn't very responsive and it makes the field hunt mini-game more strenuous than it should be because there's no perspective snap back. I was also a bit baffled as to why the voice-overs (which are excellent by the way) have been recorded in English for story segments but left in their original Japanese during battle sequences. [Note: Representatives from Atlus USA confirmed with us one day after our review went live that the retail American version of the game fixed this problem.] At least the soundtrack is appropriately strong, though, and some of the music is outright haunting.Despite its repetition and unfinished storyline, Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga still has plenty to like. Its artistic style and character designs are my favorite of any RPG so far this year, for example, and its atypical plot thematic is a nice change of pace from the usual ~save the kingdom~ fare that the genre is so well known for. Having an excellent battle mechanic and a very cool upgrade system doesn't hurt either. I only wish that there were more opportunities to really get to know the characters and their world more intimately, as the potential for greatness is definitely there but never fully realized.My only hope is that Digital Devil Saga 2 pays more attention to the bits I mentioned above when it releases later this year. With a bigger emphasis on the storyline, a better breakup of the dungeons, and improved pacing, Atlus could transform a collection of great ideas into a great videogame instead.", "date": "Apr 5, 2005"}
