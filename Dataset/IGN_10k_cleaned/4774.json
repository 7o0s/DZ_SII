Games like Shado Fighter are sure to help their cause, as this pint-sized brawler offers probably the best cellphone fighting action we've ever played. Best of all, In-Fusio recognizes that you aren't holding a PlayStation 2 in your hand, and has programmed accordingly.   Features:   Nine fighters and backgrunds  Four game play modes  Each fighter equipped with special moves   Now, we mention In-Fusio's programming skills right off the bat, because there ahs been a great deal of cellphone fighters that foolishly forget their tech. These handets canot handle Street Fighter just yet -- what with limited visuals and button input issues. Knowing this, In-Fusio set out to create a single-handed fighter -- and managed to side-step the pitfall we feared most: this isn;t a simplified fighter. Sure, the controls are easy on the thumbs, but this game has some depth.   Shado Fighter has four gameplay modes:   Story Mode: After selecting one of the fighters, you must tear up the remaining crew until you reach big Boss Shado. Each stage consists of three rounds, winner takes best two out of three.   Survival Mode: Just like it sounds, the goal is to survive on onslaught of enemy combatants. You must beatdown eight opponents without losing a single round. There are 128 fights in all, so Survival Mode looks to give Shado Fighter some serious longevity.   Time Attack: To win this challenge, you need to defeat eight fighters in record time.   Training Mode: face it, unless you actually work for In-Fusio, you're going to suck at Shado Fighter in the beginning. Why not bone up on the basics before embarrassing yourself? Training Mode teaches you all the moves -- including special moves.   Adding to Shado Fighter's girth as a game are nine fighters, including Wang, Mega, Pao, Proto, Tyron, Shun, Elena, Toki, and Shado. Each fighter has a different nationality (Wang is from China, Proto is Russian), and his or her own special fighting style. Each style comes complete with a special set of supermoves designed to devastate the competition.   Moves are assigned to the number buttons -- there is no need to try and squeeze your bananahands over the numbers and the touchpad. Special moves are unleashed through number combos. These are actually kind of hard to pull off at first, but as soon as you begin thinking of creating those quarter-circles with the number pad, you'll be fine. After all, you can text with lightning-speed, yes?   Shado Fighter looks quite good, employing a bright color pallete to dazzle-up the game's nine different backgrounds. Also impressive: the level of animation gifted to each fighter. Every moves is designed to flow together, so no awkward transitions ruin the visual experience. The game even comes complete with a little music, which we half-heartedly expected to be jettisoned due to the visuals.Shado Fighter is the best mobile fighter we've ever played, and believe us, we've tried a great deal of dogs in our time. The fighting engine is simple, but the sheer number of special moves assigned to each fighter means fans will have to spend many, many sessions with Shado Fighter to really see it all. If In-Fusio wants a bigger presence on these shores, this is an excellent way to go about it.", "date": "Jun 15, 2004"}
