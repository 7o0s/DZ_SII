The Red Sox vs. the Yankees. Ali vs. Frasier. Tom vs. Jerry.   Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers pits the two foes, along with other classic Tom and Jerry characters, into various arenas where they can beat the utter crap out of each other. Think of it as something like Power Stone meets Hanna-Barbera and you might have a decent idea of what the game is about.   War of the Whiskers is obviously intended for a younger audience, even though it carries a ~Teen~ rating. The overall look to the game is obviously very cartoony, and while it's violent it's only violent in a classic Tom and Jerry way, as opposed to, say, Itchy & Scratchy. The control scheme is about as basic as possible, which also means it's intuitive as well, so War of the Whiskers would fit well with anyone who can handle the cartoon, at least in presentation, as though the game is simplistic, it can also become somewhat aggravating.    You have a very limited amount of options available for you to battle with. You can punch and kick, but they're about as basic as possible. You can pull off a quick three move combo by pressing punch three times, but you can't really string kicks together or mix it in with the punches, so you really only have two melee attack options - punch three times or kick. It's really quite limited.   The main way that you cause damage is to pick up a nearby object and toss it at your opponent, which is how the game can get a little aggravating. You'll find yourself at a major disadvantage if you don't make use of the objects in the level, but the computer will often out-race you to them and get a hold of them first. You can usually only see a small section of the level, so when any object spawns outside of your viewing area you won't know it's appeared right away. The computer always knows when an object is around however, so regardless of whether you can see it or not, it'll immediately take off for it, putting you at an overall disadvantage. The AI can seem pretty cheap sometimes.    Even though the moves are already limited enough, with really just a three move combo being your longest attack, the pace of attacks is uninterrupted after every attack since the opponent who gets hit becomes invincible for a couple seconds. It sort of makes sense in that the designers wanted to allow for players to get away and regroup without being caught in a corner and killed without being about to come back, but this also means that as the attacker, you'll have to run after each of your attacks. This further stresses the focus on running and picking up objects to throw, but again, the computer has a very distinct advantage here.   While the single player game can be reasonably frustrating, and you have to play it in order to unlock characters other than Tom and Jerry, the multiplayer game can be reasonable, though very basic, fun. Since both players are on the same level playing field, what with not being able to ~cheat~ by seeing objects the other player can't, the competition is much more even. The game basically breaks down into a button-mashing fighter with almost zero variability in your move options, but it can result in decent fights, especially if both players really get into it. Unfortunately, there's only two-player support here instead of four.Tom and Jerry in the War of the Whiskers is about as basic of an arena fighter as they come. Will you punch, kick, block or throw stuff? That's about all the options available to you, but its cartoony faade does well to make all of this seem somewhat at home. Older gamers will want to pass on this, but younger Tom and Jerry fans may find something to like in its multiplayer mode.", "date": "Dec 1, 2002"}
