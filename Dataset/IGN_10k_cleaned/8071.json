Now, after a decade's estrangement from the strategy fold - during which Taylor delved in the RPG labyrinth with the likes of Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II - Taylor and his team at Gas Powered Games have made a triumphant and hugely accomplished return to the genre, taking the finest elements of Total Annihilation and buffing them to a modern day sheen.   Set in the distant future where three diametrically opposed factions battle for supremacy, you control a Supreme Commander, a giant battlefield robot equipped with a cornucopia of upgradeable offensive and defensive capabilities.    However, there's the catch. With your Supreme Commander key to your faction's survival (if he's destroyed then it's game over), you have to decide whether to bolster his shield and weapon systems and risk sending him into the fray, or play it safe and keep him within the confines of your base to help with construction and repairs.   From the opening minute it's clear that this is going to be one titanic strategic experience. Forget the miniscule half-hour missions of other RTS games, this is warfare at its most visceral and unceasing. Missions are three, four, sometimes five times the size of your average RTS level, each one a war of attrition in which the barrage and boom of conflict explodes in every corner.   Missions begin with just a quarter or a third of the map visible and a single main objective. During these early stages you're forced to quickly construct defences before the first waves of enemy raiders reach your position, while gathering resources and building a suitable attack force of land, air and sea units with which to sally out and begin probing the enemy's equally well fortified positions.   Within minutes you're besieged by waves of hostile tanks, bombers and ships that pound your base, pushing and probing at every weakness in your fortifications as they seek to strike a quick, killer blow. But this is only the beginning. What follows is a seesawing bloodbath of destruction as you spill out from behind your defences and attempt to push your foe back towards its base.    Complete an objective and new parts of the level are revealed, prompting you and the enemy to frantically dash towards previously hidden pockets of mass - the material needed to construct new buildings and units. In fact, balancing your mass production with your energy (the game's second resource) levels is a tricky skill to master. Stray just a little from this fragile equilibrium and all could be lost.   With the fog of war increasingly swept aside, new and previously unseen enemy bases join the conflict, ramping up the intensity levels to rupturing point. Missions become marathons of warfare, constituting countless hours of brutal, unrelenting action where instant decisions and speedy mouse clicking are as paramount to victory as the intelligent use of combined arms, resource management and cunning intelligence gathering.     However, perhaps the game's single most innovative and impressive feature is its intuitive and original tactical map, which can be moved around and zoomed in and out in a split second, with a few speedy mouse wheel rotations. The strategic map displays an overview of the entire battlefield, a top-down panorama from which every friendly and enemy unit's position and movement can be tracked, and orders issued on the grandest of scales. There's even the option to split the screen down the middle, with one half zoomed into the carnage and the other zoomed out to a tactical overview of the entire level.   By the time you've uncovered the entire map you'll have built countless bases, sacrificed thousand of units and fought scores of skirmishes on land, sea and in the clouds. All around you an awesome, terrifying theatre of destruction rages, in which hundreds of friendly and enemy units advance and fall back, consolidate and retreat on a minute-by-minute basis. This isn't so much a strategy game as a thrilling and unrelenting action extravaganza.    The plot unravels through a set of well acted (with a few notable exceptions) in-game dialogues and post-mission debriefings, which chart the closing stages of the Infinite War between three factions - the United Earth Federation (armed with conventional and instantly familiar weapons such as tanks, bombers, battleships and subs), the Cybrans (boasting massive mechanised robotic killers) and the Aeon Illuminate (packing sleek yet highly destructive alien technology). However, despite their distinct appearances, strip away the aesthetics and you quickly realise that each side's arsenal isn't really all that different from the others'.    Thankfully, the same can't be said for each faction's experimental weapons. These enormous, massively powerful and visually breathtaking vehicles of annihilation are as diverse as they are destructive and inject you with a heavy dose of dread as they creep onto your radar screen. What's more, every unit and weapon has a counter weapon - including nukes - meaning that outwitting your opponent becomes a genuine triumph.   So, with all these merits, why hasn't Supreme Commander managed to pound all of its RTS rivals into a submissive pulp? There are three main reasons, really. For starters, despite its scope and intensity Supreme Commander's epic conflicts are hamstrung by a slightly inadequate interface, which never quite gives you the level of control you need for a game of this magnitude. Secondly, All too often your attempts to launch intelligent and tactical assaults on enemy bases are repelled with consummate ease, which can be frustrating and often forces players to resort to the age-old tactic of building a gargantuan force then throwing it at the enemy in one, enormous full-frontal assault.    Chuck in some occasionally suspect path finding when moving larger groups of units and you're left with an epic experience that doesn't quite fulfil its near infinite potential. You'd also be well advised to steer clear if you're packing anything less than 3GHz of processor power and 256MB of video RAM. Don't say we didn't warn you.Supreme Commander really could have been the finest strategy game ever to grace a hard disk. As it is, its still one of the most thrilling RTS experiences on the market and a superb return to the genre for Taylor and his team. Its virtual warfare of unequalled intensity  especially in the fiendishly addictive and entertaining multiplayer modes  and is an enthralling cauldron of carnage that shouldnt be missed by any self-respecting strategy gamer. And while it may not quite be supreme, it still ranks as one of the finest strategy games youre likely to experience this year.", "date": "Feb 19, 2007"}
