Though it had its faults, Curious George looked to be a decent start for the development house, as it secured a new engine to work with and showed off a strong visual style that could be built upon in future games.  For Dreamwork's Flushed Away, however, it's obvious that along with a weaker franchise to work with, the overall product is victim to sketchy gameplay, a stripped down design, and very little depth.     Flushed Away isn't the strongest license ever to hit gaming shelves.  Seeing a very limited run of time on the big screen, the movie wasn't considered to be a huge success on any level, and much like the film, the console game lacks any serious depth.  Flushed Away features a very linear adventure design, having players roam from mission to mission as either Roddy or Rita as they fight to save the Underworld from a menacing meanie known simply as Toad.  The bottom line:  Take control of one of two main characters, and keep chasing the end of the level.  Whether the mission has you beating up baddies, stealing treasures, or escaping though the underground waterworks of the city, the gameplay is still the same.  Players can run, attack, and double-jump in familiar fashion, colleting items and coins to upgrade their characters as the story moves along.     While the main story isn't all too intriguing, it's the overall execution that really kills any potential entertainment in the world of Flushed Away.  For starters, the main character control is a bit too loose, and the amount of stress put on precision jumping will make Flushed Away a bit of a hassle for younger gamers.  Along those same lines, characters die amazingly easily, having only a few pellets of life to work with and absolutely no invincible time after a hit to adjust.  This means an attacking enemy or in-level trap can repetitively beat on the main character, and if players don't change course or fight back fast enough they'll find themselves out of play in a matter of seconds.  Much like the Curious George game, there's no real way to run out of lives, but the sheer amount of repetition that will be needed for younger gamers is definitely a bit harsh.   And while the design may have been a bit too mature for the target audience, the real problem isn't due to some global oversight, but rather a series of annoying gameplay issues.  Constant camera problems plague any type of precision platforming, teamed with a double-jump that, regardless of timing, will always be executed at the same time.  We saw this same issue in the Curious George engine, only allowing players to jump during a very small window, and Flushed Away seems to have implemented a quick fix.  Rather than not doing the jump if it's pressed too early, Roddy and Rita will save the button press and execute the second jump at the peak of the first, which feels very odd when trying to time consecutive leaps in a row.  Add in some wonky collision detection and far too many death pits, and you've got a game that feels far too rushed to put forth a solid adventure.   To say that Flushed Away missed the boat completely would be a bit of an overstatement, though it's obvious that it was nothing more than a quick push for shelf space.  Apart from the main platforming there are a few other mini-games that try and separate the action, such as a gun turret level, some boat chases, and even a couple multiplayer games outside of the main quest.  Even these seemingly simple events are unpolished, however, and feel more like a first draft than a final product.  When using the Jammy Dodger - Roddy and Rita's boat - the control is far too loose, and the speed is amazingly slow.  Rather than breaking up the main game with a fresh control scheme, it instead feels tacked on, and ends up being nothing more than bland filler to the platforming sequences.  Such is the case with all the mini-games, as it becomes apparent that this game needed a few more months of development time to be a serious choice for younger gamers.   On the audio front, the game is extremely average, supporting only a minimal amount of VO and no ability for any advanced audio settings.  The game makes use of sound-alike actors, though more dialogue would have helped a ton specifically when dealing with in-game one-liners.  It only takes a few minutes of play to shuffle through each character's script, and hearing the same enemy spouting off a few lines of text over and over gets repetitive very quickly.  The visual aspects are simply average as well, supporting no progressive or widescreen modes, and an overly simplistic look.  Team the bland textures and effects animations with an overabundance of invisible walls and you have a game that is extremely average on all fronts.  Flushed Away is a perfect example of why solid licensed games get a bad wrap.  Riding on the coattails of the movie, the adventure does very little to warrant its budget price of $29.99.  There are few solid gameplay elements, such as some clever use of Ritas grappling hook, but the overall feel of the game screams rush job from nearly every angle.  The music is generic, the VO is repetitive, the overall presentation is extremely bland, and the gameplay is chalk full of quirky execution.  Graphically the game is absolutely average, and in no way does the console counterpart work to further the franchise.  If youre looking for a solid childrens title this holiday season, something like LEGO Star Wars: The Original Trilogy is a far better choice for your money.", "date": "Nov 8, 2006"}
