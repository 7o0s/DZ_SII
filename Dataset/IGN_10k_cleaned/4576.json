{"name": "Parasite Eve", "name_review": "Parasite Eve", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/15/parasite-eve", "text": "Based on the popular Japanese novel of the same name, Parasite Eve is Square's first significant attempt to establish a new style of console role-playing games: the ~cinematic RPG.~ True to this new term, the game is literally bursting at the seams with computer-generated cinematic sequences, but, at the same time, abandons many of the elements we've come to expect after the company's past efforts. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, the game certainly isn't the best Square has delivered. But it's still far better than most other developers' best offerings.  Set in modern-day New York City (Christmas 1997, to be exact), the game follows the events of the novel on which it's based closely, but not completely. Players assume the role of NYPD officer, Aya Brea, as she attempts to unravel the mystery of Eve, a young woman responsible for a string of ghastly deaths and accidents in the city. Transformed by self-aware mitochondria, Eve possesses the power to mutate animals into savage killing machines, spontaneously ignite the innocent, and generally make a mess of everything she comes in contact with. And Aya's the only one immune to her dark powers.  If you're a die-hard Square fan, Parasite Eve will come as a shock  it's not what you're expecting in the least. Certainly, it shows the same extremely high production values as their past efforts, and it does barrow from them as well (Final Fantasy VII's Active Time Battle engine has been heavily modified), but the rest is utterly and completely new. To hardcore fans, this may be somewhat of a turn-off. But to those willing to see past the fact that it's not another Final Fantasy it offers a number of things to like, and, believe it or not, its differences work more in its favor than against it.   For starters, the hybrid turn-based/realtime combat system is simply refreshing. Having the ability to out-maneuver enemy attacks as they happen, and position yourself for more accurate attacks of your own is an idea that's time has come  but even it isn't without drawbacks. Most notable of these an unusual weapons upgrade system which ultimately proves more trouble than it's worth. But, on the whole, the combat system works in the game's favor.  From a gameplay standpoint, Parasite Eve is more of an adventure game than a role-playing title (or a ~Resident Evil wanna-be,~ for that matter). It's about recreating the course of the novel, not giving players full freedom to explore the game world. It's extremely linear, but that's the price paid for basing the game on an existing literary work -- watch most book to movie translations, and you'll see something similar. So what we end up with can be alternately entertaining, yet also an exercise in ~going through the paces~ to reach the goal. Also in the process of turning the book's plot into a game, we end up with a lot of filler (random battles) between major plot points, which are simply battles with Eve's many forms more often than not.   Parasite Eve should be lauded for its presentation, which, in a testament to Square's work, is second to none. Everything from its character design to its pre-rendered backgrounds to its CG cinematics are utterly breathtaking. To top it off, the translation is one of Square's best yet  more than readable, it captures the mature tone of the book perfectly. But for those that seek long adventures, however, consider yourself forewarned: Parasite Eve can be finished in roughly 14 hours, even by complete novices.  When all is said and done, the game may turn away a majority of the hardcore role-playing public with its striking departure from Square's ~norm,~ although I'd still recommend giving it a look  it's a beautiful game. Those without a pre-conceived notions of it being Square's best game to date, or who simply want to see what else the company is capable of, will find it an adventure worth taking despite its flaws. Just don't expect another Final Fantasy VII.  Randy Nelson", "date": "Sep 15, 1998"}
