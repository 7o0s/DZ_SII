It's first two games, Word Heaven and Girls Night Out Solitaire, definitely have attributes that should appeal those the X chromosome. But fancy trimmings only go so far; if the core game play doesn't work, there's just no hiding it.   Fortunately, in the case of Word Heaven, the game play itself is fine. As well it should be, because it's a game we're played a few times before... Gameloft's 1000 Words, EA Mobile's Word Whomp, etc. As a fan of word games, though, Word Heaven's familiar formula provides some solid entertainment. The chief mechanic here is that you must create words from a jumble of letters at the bottom of the screen. Each successful word gooses a point meter at the top of the screen, and when you have filled enough of the meter, you can go on to the next round.   Word Heaven does benefit from a few added elements, such as the occasional appearance of a seventh letter that opens up entirely new word combinations. There are also point multipliers, like dark stars and shooting stars, that help you move on to the next level quicker. You can, of course, stay with the current jumble and keep gathering points until the timer runs out. High scores are posted on an internal ~Personal Best~ board -- no external competition here.   Word Heaven does have a more leisurely mode that doesn't hold a timer over your head. It's designed as a pressure-less distraction, and I can appreciate its inclusion. In fact, even in the timed mode, the works overtime to keep things from being hectic -- which is usually the hallmark of a puzzle game. The heavenly theme is fulfilled by an ever-present angel that looks more like a holiday cookie than one of God's sons of fire. Stars gently soar across the sky, new letter flutter into place -- the whole affair is designed more to soothe than stress, which is why you won't see me complaining that the game seemed too easy. That's obviously the point here.  Word Heaven breaks zero new ground, as far as game play is concerned. If you already have a similar game on your handset, I cannot really recommend you replace it with Word Heaven. However, if you are looking for a puzzle game that does raise your pulse -- something you can just relax and enjoy -- then you will appreciate LimeLife's approach.", "date": "Jan 31, 2006"}
