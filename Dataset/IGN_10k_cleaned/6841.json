Combine those numbers with the sheer amount of GBA, DS and GameCube owners in the world, and the figure is outrageous.  In fact, whether we love them or hate them, movie-based games often bank on the success of their franchise, and Ice Age 2 is proving to do the same thing.  While we were amazingly happy with the GameCube version, the portable renditions don't seem to hold up as well, as we first took a look at Ice Age 2 for DS, and now move on to the Game Boy Advance.   While the GBA may be fading into the darkness when it comes to original intellectual properties, it's still very much alive due to value packs, licensed products, and the occasional first party Nintendo hit.  A few of the mundane licensed games surprise us, delivering amazing quality for young gamers.  The majority, however, tend to be simply average, or in the worst case scenario downright poor.  In the case of Ice Age 2, it isn't a poor license or a lack of effort that brings it down, it's simply the fact that it isn't fun.     The Meltdown is based around two different gameplay styles.  Every licensed game on the planet seems to be taking this approach, and we really don't understand the appeal.  In this case, players will control Scrat in side-scrolling levels, while they use the main cast of Ice Age 2, including Sid, Manny and Diego, to solve top-down adventure puzzle levels.     It's the lack of execution that really hurts the package.  Rather than taking one core game mechanic and perfecting it, designers attempted to deliver both the side-scrolling action and the top-down adventure.  For starters, the side-scrolling portion seems thrown together and is definitely the weak point.  Players control Scrat in Sonic-inspired levels.  Scrat can double-jump, attack and slide to navigate the levels, though the gameplay wears thin amazingly fast.  The stages themselves are made up of basic platforms, and the camera is zoomed in far too close to react to the action.  Luckily this mode serves as an intermission from the main gameplay, which is obviously the bulk of the production.     Players will find most of their entertainment in the puzzle-adventure mode, which uses the three main Ice Age cast members to navigate environment mazes.  Each character can be used to interact with the world in a different way, and strategy and cooperation will have to be used to reach the destination for each level.  While the trio of animals each have necessary strengths, they also have weaknesses that players will have to work around.  Sid, for instance, can't enter dangerous terrain such as lava, but instead has the ability to swim in water, walk across slippery areas with ease and can operate switches for other characters.  At the same time, Manny has no problem moving over dangerous terrain, but is too heavy for some areas of a given level.  He can also float in the water, but is terrible on ice.  In addition, the characters can interact with each other to solve puzzles.  Manny can launch Sid across gaps, both Sid and Diego can use Manny as a platform in water (as Diego can't swim), and Diego can jump across gaps to open alternate routes for his friends.   While the system is balanced, it simply isn't very fun.  The bulk of gameplay is spent walking the characters from place to place, often leaving one behind that will require backtracking.  It's as if they took an action-adventure game and removed all the action.  We understand that the focus is on puzzle gameplay, but without any enemy interaction or true rating system the game's puzzles seem uneventful and repetitive.  In fact, Ice Age's control is a bit unpolished as well, as characters often get held up on the edge of collisions or have to use trial and error to determine where an action can be used.  No on-screen prompt is used to show players that their characters are standing in the desired spot, so simple tasks such as jumping gaps and climbing walls can be frustrating at times.  In the end, however, it isn't the flawed execution that really brings the appeal down.  The design works, it just doesn't bring any compelling gameplay that would drive players to continue.     Aside from the flawed gameplay, Ice Age offers a total mixed bag when it comes to presentation.  On one hand, the main animation for the puzzle-adventure portion is pretty smooth.  The characters move fluidly and the environments have a basic (but solid) design.  The side-scrolling portions are a different story altogether.  Mixing rendered character art and amazingly simple tile sets, the platforming sections of the game feel out of place and rushed.  This would have been a far stronger title if the designers would have stuck with one main gameplay mechanic.  The audio is decent, offering generic movie-themed music with short VO clips of the characters.  The included cutscenes are very basic, but they help move the story along nicely.  All in all, Ice Age 2 offers a mixed bag of presentation elements that go hand in hand with the melancholy gameplay.  While Ice Age 2 GBA is undoubtedly flying off the shelves due to the success of the movie, we simply cant recommend the adventure.  Its amazingly generic, offering a mixed bag of both gameplay and presentation elements.  Puzzles are plain and uninspired, as the game seems to offer no truly entertaining moments.  Sure there are few movie-inspired areas that bring a smile to our face, but the majority of gameplay is far too basic for the age group intended.  The entire adventure seems to be thrown together, meshing strong and weak visual elements, basic audio production and a grab bag of level design.  This one fits right in with the prior catalog of generic movie licensed games and should be passed up by the majority of gamers.  Its simply average and void of entertainment.  If an Ice Age 2 game is a necessity, we strongly recommend the console versions.", "date": "Apr 14, 2006"}
