{"name": "Mystic Heroes", "name_review": "Mystic Heroes", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/25/mystic-heroes", "text": "Traditionally, there has been only two big camps of game making - the Euro-American side, with it's Mad Dog McCree crap-o-rama, and the Japanese, closely planned, strictly directed hits. Admittedly, some Euro-American titles have just enough redeeming value (like Full Throttle, or Grim Fandango) to save them from being shiny targets at the local gun range, but recently, some of the stuff floating over the boat from the Inland Sea has left a bad taste on some gamers who've grown accustomed to the high quality games on the other side of the Pacific rim.   Mystic Heroes is one of the many long line of strategy type games that supposed to let players engage in piss-ant small unit tactics amidst the backdrop of a larger conflict. In trying to break with their chief moneymaking title (Romance of the Three Kingdoms), Koei has forayed into some rather brutal territory, that of the 3D platformer slash action-adventure with pseudo-RPG elements.    What is amazing is that Koei has created some rather unique games in recent years, all while maintaining the principles of a faceless, financially sound, multi-national corporation. It's not to say that all of their attempts are smashing successes, but rather, it is the company's willingness to try out new spins on tried and true genres. Mystic Heroes is no exception, and show cases several previous titles from Koei's archives.   Gameplay  If you've played Koei's latest installment of the Die-Nasty-Warriors series, you have a good idea of what Mystic Heroes is like. However, there are marked differences in how the game actually plays from its more realistic looking counterpart (with the ever so sexy Zhen Ji) Mystic Heroes also incorporates some marked improvements you hope to see in the next Die-Nasty-Warriors game (but not with 4 - it's set in stone already in Japan, folks).     The most important change has to be the manually operated camera. Similar to what is featured in Super Mario Sunshine, the right stick gives players the added advantage of control of the camera to look around corners, or slide it into a better position to view the on screen action. One of the biggest complaints in Die-Nasty-Warriors 3 was the lack of a ~pivot-cam~ that allowed players to see how many people were chasing them when they were on the battlefield. Mystic Heroes' manual camera control is a necessary addition since the game avatar takes up a greater percentage of the screen than normal.    The game is set-up to exploit the maximum potential of replayability (what the IGN yokels call, 'Appeal', although this hardly warrants a word of such magnitude; we're talking about a game, not something a bit more fishy, if you know what I mean and I think you do). The factor of ~we-playability~ figures into the runes that you collect throughout the course of completing Story Mode multiple times, but also from the fact that each character can inherit their statistics from previous games to better help them in the next play.    Unlike Die-Nasty-Warriors 3, each character in Mystic Heroes has three separate statistic pools - on Easy, Normal, and Hard. This means to potentially maximized all characters; you will need to play each character through all three difficulties. This is not made easier that ~Free Mode~, which allows players to take their favorite characters in any stage in Story mode, requires that a character complete Story mode on that difficulty first. This means if you want to use all modes to their fullest, you will need to finish Story mode at least a dozen times.    Luckily for you, the fighting controls are culled from Die-Nasty-Warriors and an early Koei PlayStation game called Destrega. Although the story of Mystic Heroes was based on the actual destruction of the ruling Chinese Dynasty in the Second Century B.C., Koei's addition of magic, monsters, and no small amount of military thrusting forks has allowed the inclusion of magic spells to spice up an otherwise cheap knock-off of the Die-Nasty-Warriors series. The fighting controls consist of a single non-magical attack, jump, guard/dodge, and two spell buttons. Mystic Heroes' dodge maneuver is a smart addition to Koei's repertoire of game tricks. Using it, a player is rendered invincible to attacks, but cannot counter-attack while   dodging. This maneuver is almost required for the harder difficulties. The game also borrows heavily from Mr. Link, giving every character a spin slash (that also makes them invincible) that serves as a great attack.   But that's where the similarities end. Whereas Die-Nasty-Warriors relied on small incremental boosts of statistics or health, Mystic Heroes focuses on combinations, permutations, and the fun they yield from the existence of the more than 70 runes available in the game. Each rune possesses different attack spells that vary in speed, strength, manner, and element. With the ability to equip two runes (with no duplicates) there is a great number of possibilities, as well as room for strategic jockeying.    You'd figure that with all this junk in Naja's trunk, that the enemies in Mystic Heroes would be pushovers. Instead, the game sports some rather cheap enemies that will easily frustrate players (by the way, never stand next to an enemy you just knocked down, unless you plan to use some magic). The PS2 version has slightly easier enemies, although not by much. The bosses are mostly the same, with the addition of a new crab like boss that resembles the Feldynaught from Mega Man Legends. You remember don't you? It's the giant purple boss that Tron ~Bonner~ piloted when she was attempting to sexually destroy Mega Man on Kattalox Island. The boss is like that, but since you have allied help, it's not a big deal. All the bosses from the GameCube version of the game make their appearance in unchanged forms.     The major improvements the PlayStation 2 version has over the earlier GameCube copy is not merely the lnclusion of four extra characters (Dax, Mirah, Raja, and Kai) but the availability of new modes (other than the B.S. Survival mode that anyone can beat). Aside from Story and Survival modes (both in the GCN version, ya' losers) the PS2 copy has: a Mission mode that features some rather difficult stages that need some thought put into it to beat; and a Free mode that allows players to skip to stages where they missed a rune, play the stage, get the rune, and save.   Some other differences are too minor to discuss without playing both games, but they include a more controllable combo/magic attack sequence - the GameCube version either suffered from lack of fine control, or buffered key presses too far to make combos effectively delivered; a less cheesy enemy AI - where those peons that look like Onimusha rejects kept jabbing at players until they died when they were approaching to make an attack; and a heavier dose of fogging, due to the lack of processing power on the PS2 --this makes some enemies that could be hit from further away in the GameCube version impossible to hit on the PS2. Although the increased level of fog is regrettable, this allows the PS2 to draw the game objects at the same level of the GameCube.    One thing Die-Nasty-Warriors veterans will dislike is the difficulty of doing multi-hit combos (juggling) enemies. The PS2 has cut short the button command buffering times, but the problem is still there. Although clearly not necessary in beating the game, landing high combos on an enemy will yield better items. However, Mystic Heroes sports more automatic combinations than Die-Nasty-Warriors; whereas the ROTK smash and grab allows players to do infinite hit combos (four weak, then one strong hit, repeat) Mystic Heroes ~solved~ this bug by cutting short sword combos to three hits (non-magical) and requires a magic follow up for boosting combo hits higher. This limits attack possibilities somewhat, but make for very challenging stages in Mission mode (try getting a 100 hit combo in sixty seconds).   Also new is the existence of level 5 spell runes. When a character is completely powered up, he or she loses her distinctiveness due to the hot-swappable runes that changes the character's spells (one of the complaints about Final Fantasy VII was this notion of hot-swappable spell materia). Koei added incentive to choose runes aligned with a character's element by adding an extra level of spells. Although not terribly enticing, the addition of these powerful new spells adds a notion of individuality to all the characters. This means Shiga will not be able to use Hell Storm, no matter how hard you wish for it.   In addition to the new spell runes (some PS2 runes, like Fusenso, have different spells from their GameCube counterpart), the four new characters are markedly different from the original four characters in terms of stats. Captain Dax (whose affinity is Ice) plays as a much stronger version of Lani (or as I like to call her, 'Little Lani'); Mirah, the princess with the fan, has three times the magic of Naja (Mirah, of course, is Fire); Raja (the guy in the bathrobe holding a big sword) is a stronger version of Shiga (Wind) with more reach and power, but at the cost of speed; finally Kai, one of the really cool caped bosses, is a faster version of Tai (Thunder). The addition of four new characters makes mutli-player that much more interesting, although now you have to spring not just for the additional controllers, but a PlayStation multi-tap as well.    The one problem is the expectation that Mystic Heroes plays like it looks; although the game looks like a Saturday morning cartoon on the Kids' Network, with the oversized heads and cutesy limbs, Mystic Heroes sports a harder challenge than Dynasty Warriors 3 on Hard. Admittedly, playing Cao Cao with his fourth weapon on any difficulty is easier than killing babies with an axe, but with Mystic Heroes, the challenge factor is ramped up significantly (although survival mode is easier than setting records in the ~Kill 1000 men in 90 minutes or less, or your meat bun is free Challenge~ in Die-Nasty-Warriors 3).    Still, Mystic Heroes is a beatable game. Without cheating, it is possible to get most of the runes and complete most of the game. It's really that last 2% (and the mysterious M10 rune) that gets everyone's goat.    Graphics  The graphics are comparable to the GameCube version, even with the inclusion of 100 plus enemies on screen. The phasing bug from Die-Nasty-Warriors is fixed - enemies no longer hit your player, then phase out; instead, all the enemies that area attacking are given priority in being rendered at the expense of enemies who are further away. This solved that problem fast.   Aesthetically, the game has attempted to merge Japanese styles into a Chinese setting with unspectacular results. The terrain is textured well enough to pass, and objects are easily recognized for what they are (power-up, power-up vessel, indestructible object, wall, etc.). All the characters are easily recognizable, and so are the majority of the enemies. Many of the motions can be described as tolerable, but as with most games that focus on action, some of the details (like the robes and ribbons on the characters) do not move as smoothly as in real life (this is to say, that they don't move at all).    Excessively bad clipping is almost non-existent, although some brushes are rendered incorrectly, allowing archers to fire through walls, as well as the regular compliment of spears and swords going through walls. Eye-candy is regulated to a bare minimum since the focus is on how to use terrain to a player's advantage. The whole look of the game may prove unappealing to some players, nor is there new lighting for the PS2 version.   The overall look of Mystic Heroes is well founded, and toyght ('tight') - toyght like a tiger. Unlike Destrega and Die-Nasty-Warriors though, Mystic Heroes' women do not elicit much of a twitch from anywhere on one's body. No, not even ~Little Lani~.    Sound  If there's one complaint you must have for Koei's ~sell-out the Cubers and let's go to Sony~ ploy was the lack of the original Japanese voicing. Not that the people Koei America goes to is bad, but they are so bad, you want to have a murder of crows suck out your body oils from your inner ear so that you cannot hear the game. For some reason, Koei kept the original   Japanese voicing in Die Nasty Warriors, but not with Mystic Heroes and that is a shame. If anyone visits the Koei site, please give it the numbers of the people Konami used to voice Metal Gear Solid.   Effect wise, the spells all generate sounds unique to their element (wind, ice, fire, thunder) and it is a delight to hear the effects cue players in on what is going on (especially in multi-player). Many times, you can hear what is coming and prepare for it in advance. Enemy voices and effects are also vital, since some enemies can die and be very hard to tell if they are dead dead, or merely resting. The terminal death scream sound is of vital importance when fighting some of the tougher enemies.    Apart from the sound/voices (which cannot be turned off), the music is surprisingly pleasant and is something I would not mind ripping to my Xbox and listening to on the beach (On Zack Island). With eight lonely single girls aged 18 to 24 playing volleyball, giving gifts, and wearing exciting underwear. From Winback to Romance, Koei's music department (or their non-union Taiwanese subsidiary) has always produced tolerable, unique pieces that compliment the game, rather than attempt to strike off and try to stand out from the crowd. All in all, Mystic Heroes' music is forgettable, but like a familiar symphony, is rather pleasant if uninspired. Mystic Heroes is a solid game, and a great distraction to all the other over-hyped titles out there (Shinobi, Rygar, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Snitches). With this title, you don't expect it to live up to any promises made countless times and months before (The Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver) nor do you expect a really deep game with lots of secrets to unlock (Dead or Alive Volleyball). You only have a solid game with great action, and enough planning (what George Bush number 2 calls, 'strategery') to get any true gamer going.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
