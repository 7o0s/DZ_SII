The title spawned four separate sequels and let players carve their way down numerous mountain slopes.  Now, PSP owners can grab some powder with its release on the PlayStation Store.   The focus of Cool Boarders isn't about freestyle boarding, mogul racing or terrain park skills.  Instead, Cool Boarders focuses on downhill boarding on various mountains.  However, you won't have to challenge fellow racers as you charge down the hill; instead, time is your only opponent as you sprint down one of the three initially available slopes.  As you attempt to cross the finish line before time runs out, you'll be graded on two separate criteria - how quickly you finish the race and the points you receive for pulling off tricks on the hill. Depending on how well you perform under these two criteria, you unlock new boards or courses. Plus, if you're looking to improve on your races, you can use the built in Ghost Mode to replay your previous trip down the mountain and give you some virtual competition.    Having a sense of how well you're doing can be particularly difficult.  Obviously, as long as you manage to make checkpoints before time runs out, you're in the clear.  However, regardless of how long you hold one of the limited tricks included in the game, such as a Tail or Indy Grab, the announcer constantly complains that you can do much better.  This can be extremely frustrating, especially if you start pulling these tricks Fakie-wise or land all of your moves.   Of course, successfully managing to navigate the various courses or remain upright is an extremely difficult task thanks to the limited and questionable control scheme.  Players only have the option to jump or perform a hard turn to carve their way down the mountain.  However, the turn move is way too imprecise - players can accidentally perform full circles that eliminate all forward momentum as they attempt to switch directions.  The carving rarely works to prevent you from tumbling over cliffs along each race course as well, because your control over your board is quite imprecise.  Even though each board is rated in one of three categories, the stability and control of each board is ineffective with the numerous hairpin curves and sharp turns that you have to maneuver through.  As a result, you'll find yourself pinballing your way down some mountain courses instead of cleanly navigating tracks.   Even worse, time has not been particularly kind to Cool Boarders when it comes to the visual department.  The original graphics were somewhat harsh, with stiff tumble animations and bland texturing for rocks and other environmental objects.  While players could forgive some of these issues at the time thanks to the standard def television screens, the much sharper PSP screens highlight a lot of the game's flaws, such as the numerous black texture seams and rips that run rampant across every single course.  The angle of the camera behind your racers can also make it extremely difficult to see when you're coming up on a cliff or a turn, so you'll find that you'll wipeout much more frequently than you expected.The courses may have been slick at one point, and the introduction of snowboarding on the PlayStation was impressive 11 years ago, but time has not been great to Cool Boarders.  Weak controls, a lack of competition or multiplayer options and rough visuals are just some of the problems that complicate this downloadable classic.  If youve got a taste for nostalgia, you may want to check this game out, but if youve got to have snowboarding for your PSP, track down SSX On Tour.", "date": "Feb 20, 2007"}
