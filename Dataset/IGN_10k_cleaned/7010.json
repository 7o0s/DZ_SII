The game boots to various clips of wrestlers fighting it out in real-time by way of Nitro's 3D engine. The action is completely void of any music and worse, it actually pauses between each clip as if it were loading. After 15 seconds of this, we are treated to the game's title screen.   WCW/NWO Revenge it isn't.   And that's true enough. After all, the games were developed by two completely different teams -- World Tour and Revenge by Asmik/Aki and Nitro by Nintendo 64 newcomer Inland Productions. Hard-core wrestling fans will recognize Inland Productions as the same development house that delivered WCW Nitro and, more recently, WCW Thunder to PlayStation owners, both of which were slammed unanimously by the videogame press and gamers alike. Unfortunately, this shoddy port -- and it is nothing more than a port -- of Nitro to Nintendo 64 isn't likely to receive favorable reviews from anyone, us included.  Features  16 immediately selectable WCW and NWO superstars, plus 48 hidden wrestlers for a total of 64 playable characters. Run-in wrestlers. Multiple gameplay modes including Tournament, Exhibition, Exhibition Tag Team, Two-player Versus, Two-player Tag Team and Four-player Battle Royal. More than 30 different moves to choose from. Ring-out fights. Surprise attacks. Multiple rings including Nitro, NWO, WCW, Fall Brawl, American Bash and Halloween Havoc. Rumble Pak Support. Controller Pak compatible.   Gameplay If you've ever played the PlayStation version of Nitro -- or Thunder -- let us first warn you that there isn't much different here. Nitro (64) retains the same gameplay mechanics of past incarnations, which means that wrestlers control identically (and digitally, despite the use of Nintendo's analog stick), moves are the same, surprise attacks are the same, and reversals are virtually absent, just as before. Even the menus are the same. In fact, the only real difference we can tell here is the speed, which has seen a significant, though entirely manufactured boost. And, of course, there are no longer any FMVs, which are, pathetically, one of the best features of Thunder for PlayStation.   For those of you unfamiliar with this game, it plays drastically different from THQ's Revenge in that it doesn't employ the traditional ~grappling~ system, which has won over wrestling fans across the platform. Instead, it plays more along the lines of Acclaim's WWF Warzone, meaning it forces players to master sequenced button combinations in conjunction with input from the D-Pad or Analog stick to execute moves. The problem is that it features a mere fraction of the moves present in Warzone and doesn't offer players a practice mode to adequately learn them.   The clunky fighting system is frustrating at best. Control is jerky and fairly unresponsive, which often invites players to button-mash. Wrestlers shrug-off powerful moves and pop right back onto their feet with no hesitation. Worst of all though, the entire game just feels like the PlayStation version before it -- a game more than a year old -- and by no means is that a good thing. Even the game's four-player Battle Royal, a feature that one would think to be a shoe-in, quickly grows tiresome as the control system isn't rewarding.   On a brighter side, Nitro does feature a healthy selection of wrestlers -- 64 in total -- and 16 are immediately playable. Gamers can jump right in and play as Hollywood Hogan, Bret Hart, Sting, Lex Luger, Giant, Diamond Dallas Page, Raven, Saturn, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Curt Hennig, Macho Man Randy Savage, Rich Steiner, Scott Steiner and Jericho. A total of 48 additional wrestlers can be unlocked by playing through the one-player Tournament mode on normal or hard difficulty. Upon beating the Tournament a secret wrestler will be revealed. This wrestler must then be used to play through the Tournament again in order to unlock the next hidden character. This extends the game's replay value greatly.   Graphics Once again, WCW Nitro looks very similar to its PlayStation inspiration. While wrestlers do feature smooth-skinned textures for seamless polygon meshes, animation is a whole different story; characters move awkwardly and at irregular speeds. By comparison, Revenge looks more realistic. That's not to say that the game is ugly. It's not. Wrestlers, for the most part, look fine and brighten and darken with a faked dynamic lighting from crowd camera flashes. The crowd, made up of one giant, gray, blurry blob, animates horribly and looks just awful. The only thing worse are these ugly gray spots apparent when the camera pans back to reveal a run-in. Did Inland Productions overlook this or does it just not care? Also, don't expect any wrestler intros here as there aren't any.  The Playstation-ness of this conversion is most translucent in the game's jagged edges and unstable camera system. It's simply not very smart. Instead of following wrestlers around (when brawling outside the ring), the camera instead overlooks the action through the ropes, giving players a semi-obstructed view of their opponent. Had this game been more than a careless port, something like this would have surely been corrected.   Sound The game features standard rock guitar riffs, random commentary and traditional grunts and yells. Nothing especially outstanding and nothing terrible. The thud of throwing an opponent on the ground sounds realistic enough and that's good enough for us. Don't expect the ambient crowd calls or flashy intro music of Revenge here.  What we have here is THQ milking the WCW license at the expense of Nintendo 64 owners. Nitro (64) is, simply put, a rushed, pathetic port of the year-old PlayStation version and it shows. Virtually everything about this game, from its dusty control system to its intentionally sped-up sense of speed, looks and feels dated and, above everything else, it just isn't fun. The only redeeming feature this game offers, in my opinion, is its hidden 48 characters, which must be unlocked one-by-one by playing through the game over again. But honestly, what's the point of even bothering if the game is crap? And this, my friends, belongs in the toilet bowl.Stay away. Not even the game's multiplayer mode is worth it.", "date": "Feb 12, 1999"}
