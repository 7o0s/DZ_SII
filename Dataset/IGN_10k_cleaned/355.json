Although Accolade was striving to make something different,  different isn't always good.  Pitball is a strange hybrid between Rollerball, soccer, and that ancient Aztec sport. Two teams of two compete in square arenas, and try to get a glowing ball into its goal.  In all honesty, this game looks really nice. The intro is nicely done, the traps and weapons are a cool addition, and Toshinden-like special moves are an added bonus as well. What really keeps Pitball from sinking into the ground is its techno/jungle soundtrack. Music can either make or break a game, and fortunately for Accolade, it made it... barely   The major problem with this game is the amount of load time. It's not as excrutiating as Samurai Showdown 3, but it is annoying and frequently occurs between every match. Another major flaw is the gameplay. For example, the button control is confusing. It seems that no matter what configuration I invent, I still forget what does what. In addition, after being knocked down (which doesn't take much might I add) your player takes forever to stand back up. Meanwhile, your opponent scores a quick point. Overall, this game doesn't have much appeal and the fun factor only occurs in a multi-player match. The only redeeming quality is the music. If you live alone and have no friends, this is the last game you should buy.", "date": "Dec 19, 1996"}
