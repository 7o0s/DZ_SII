{"name": "NBA Live 1996", "name_review": "NBA Live 96", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/nba-live-96", "text": "Sure NBA live '96 is not the most technically advanced basketball game out there, but when it comes to gameplay it's hard to beat it. The wide variety of options and features make Live the most versatile and complete basketball game yet, and even though it's not perfect, it's one hell of a game.  Live truly shines when it comes to its totally realistic and easy-to-call plays. There are 16 quick calls you can choose from each of the seven offensive sets, plus more options and stats than any other game. However, there is a down side. The players tend to look as if they're sliding around on ice skates at times, and the fouls can get a little out of control. These faults aside, NBA Live '96 is a great basketball game that'll have you playing when you should very well be doing other things, like working or spending time with your family. Oh well, who needs that when there's great games like these?   Jay Boor", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
