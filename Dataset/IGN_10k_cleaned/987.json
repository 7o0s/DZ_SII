Maybe I was being just a bit too harsh.  It turns out that after a loooooooong warming up period, it's possible to get used to the controls of Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram through the standard Dreamcast controller.  The only problem is that the game isn't as fun an experience and loses a good amount of its appeal.  It's still an overall enjoyable game, but I wish more people would have the chance to experience VOOT as it was originally conceived.  In case you're unfamiliar with Sega's vision of arcade-style mech-based warfare, here are the details.  You select from one of twelve mechs, each with different weapons, agility, and strength, and head out to a small arena for a fast-paced battle to the death (err, until time runs out, that is).  You view the action from a behind-the-mech perspective, and can make your mech walk and dash around the arena, jump, guard, look around, and attack both up close and from away.  You must get your opponent in your sites and blast him to death from afar or slash him to death up close, all the while dodging and blocking incoming attacks.  In the game's arcade mode, you make your way through battle after battle with the various opponent mecha, with a couple of awesome boss encounters thrown in there as well.  Making your way through the arcade mode is actually a tough experience, as the difficulty is set tremendously high, even in the lowest difficulty setting.  Interestingly enough, there doesn't seem to be too much in the way of a progressive difficulty when making your way through this mode - I actually found myself having difficulty fighting certain mechs alone.  It certainly makes a good amount of sense, as the mechs are of such different variety, and it makes the focus of the game center more on mastering strategies for individual match-ups rather than just mastering a given mech.  Of course, as with the game's arcade counterpart, you're not just limited to fighting computer opponents.  The US version of Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram, while lacking 'net play (you know, Activision, we would've gladly waited three months extra), features an alarming number of split screen versus modes.  You can split the action horizontally or vertically, or you can opt to keep the screen aspect ratio correct while fighting through a tiny square window.  The latter actually works the best, especially on a large TV, but all modes benefit from being free of glitches.  At last, a split screen mode that doesn't seem like a last minute addition!  The fighting, be it against human or computer opponents, is alarmingly fast, so quick in fact that it will take a few fights for you to get the hang of things.  However, this isn't just a hyper quick arcade experience at all, as there's plenty of strategy to be had for those who take the time to master the game's intricacies.  VOOT is leaps and bounds more fulfilling than the original Virtual On thanks to the inclusion of air dashes, dash and jump cancels, a greater arsenal of attacks, and a more strategic up-close combat system.  Furthermore, the arenas of battle are even more interactive this time around, featuring pools of water that actually slow you down, along with the expected platforms and walls which block incoming projectiles (well, most incoming projectiles).  It's a surprisingly deep experience, but can you touch the depth without your very own Twin Sticks peripheral?  The answer is a so-so yes.  The arcade version of VOOT and its prequel make use of a dual lever control setup in order to control mech movement.  Pushing forward on both levers makes the mech move forward, backwards makes the mech move back, splitting the levers apart makes the mech jump, bringing them together cancels the jump or guard, pushing one lever up with the other lever back makes the mech rotate, and so on and so forth.  In Japan, Sega released a so called ~Twin Sticks~ peripheral for Dreamcast which brought this control to the home, for a price.  Activision has chosen not to release the peripheral here, and we haven't heard any specifics from a 3rd party regarding the possibility.  So, we're stuck using the standard Dreamcast controller through one of the game's many standard configurations (inexplicably, you can't custom map the controller).  The biggest issue when using the standard controller seems at first to center around the inability to easily rotate your mech on an axis, but there are ways around this.  You'll likely find yourself ignoring the problem completely after gaining some experience in battle, but even after extensive practice in the game's very complete training mode, the sense of control through the controller never really approaches the level offered by the Twin Sticks.  The problem has to do with the controls occasionally feeling unresponsive, but even more important is that the Twin Sticks are just a more natural means of controlling these mech bad-boys.  Comparing the situation to playing House of the Dead 2 without the gun is a bit on the harsh side, but it actually ends up being the same vein of problem.  My first experience with VOOT was through the standard Dreamcast controller when the import was released last year, and even then, having never tried the game with Twin Sticks, it still felt very awkward (but yes, I forced myself to play).  And now, having played a good deal of VOOT and the original through the arcade-style control, I can honestly say that the proprietary peripheral is the way to go here.  Don't get me wrong, though -- the problem isn't severe beyond redemption, and many will likely put up with it once they've gotten caught up in the game's awesome universe.  Virtual On has a huge cult following for a reason that goes beyond just the fast fighting.  The game propels you into an anime-influenced mechanical world, with its masterful human-like mecha designs created by Katohi Haijime of Gundam fame.  These bad boys and girls of the mech fighting circuit are packed with the tiniest details, right down to the Dreamcast units on their backs (the mechs from the original had Saturn units on their backs, in case you've forgotten).  From the digital sound track to the robotic announcer's voice, all the way to some of the most amazing graphics around, including incredible image quality, eerily smooth 60 frames per second fights, and moving backgrounds, Sega's made this a mech lover's dream come true as far as presentation goes.  But the Japanese version of the game is the true mech lover's dream come true as far as gameplay is concerned, and if at some point down the line a third party releases a Twin Sticks peripheral stateside, the US version will join it.  For now, the US version is still full of strategy and offers up lots of fun, but as I play it, I keep on thinking that with a little more planning, time, and consideration, Activision could've easily brought us the full experience.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 6, 2000"}
