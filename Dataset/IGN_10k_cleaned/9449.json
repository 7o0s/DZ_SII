It was a constant, something dependable. And now Simpsons games are, you knowgood. It all started with Hit and Run, that clever and funny Grand Theft Auto meets Springfield from Vivendi. After that, Electronic Arts snagged the rights and put a new team on a fresh game design: The Simpsons Game. I honestly can't speak for the console version, but when it comes to the Nintendo DS game, it's a surprisingly good game that doesn't just pay enormous fan service to Simpsons watchers; it does so in a design that's pretty fun to play, too.   In the past, Simpsons games were merely generic and formulaic action or platform games. Though I rag on the Simpsons brand's past reputation of being universally awful, Konami's arcade brawler was actually pretty good. But again, it was at its core a reskinned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Not exactly specific to the characters or the Springfieldian humor.  What EA did for The Simpsons Game is essentially approach its game as the writers approach an episode: spoof it. Once the characters learn they're in a videogame, it's all about attacking the cliches and making a mockery of the entire industry.   The Simpsons Game's strength is in its writing: this title is pretty darn funny. No, scratch that, it's actually very funny, and though it doesn't have the structure of a Simpsons episode it's clear that much of the game was handled by a writing team that knows the characters inside and out. It is essentially a satire on the entire videogame industry, and no one is safe from the writers. Not even Electronic Arts or its big name designers, or even the stores where you might have dropped the hard-earned cash for the copy of the game you'll be playing. It also revives many one-off jokes from past Simpsons episodes, some of which are so obscure that you might miss them. For example: a dog shooting bees out of his mouth? Don't blink or those jokes will zip right past.   It's also about the presentation. Like the writing, the designers approach the production of the game like an episode of the series. Throughout the span of the gameplay the tale is told through cartoon cutscenes - oddly, in the Nintendo DS, the developers animate 3D models for its video clips where the console editions use traditional cel animation. Why? I'm guessing the cel animation was probably still being produced in Korea when the DS version was wrapping up production, so the DS team took the already recorded voice over and created their own cutscenes using simpler 3D animation. Hey, it's as good a guess as any. Even with the 3D look to the cutscenes, the videos still retain the humor in the story the designers are trying to tell.    The game takes traditional game ideas and mocks them for our amusement.   And then there's the voice work. Holy crap is there a lot of it. Even though cartridge sizes are at a premium, the developers packed the Simpsons Game with tons of one-liners from all the Simpsons and their Springfield neighbors. Like any game that relies on a character saying certain things during a specific action, there are instances where you'll hear the same thing again and again, but because a lot of the speech is level specific the variety is something you just can't ignore. And though some lines fall flat in their delivery, it's hard not to chuckle at some of the things the characters say. (~Homer needs food badly.~ ~Homer needs beer badly too!~) The Simpsons Game definitely scored some top-notch writers.   A game can only go so far on writing alone. Sure it's funnybut it's also fun. Amaze worked what the console team built in 3D onto the Nintendo DS as a 2D experience that spans both screens as a single display. Each level puts one or two characters to the task of completing the challenge, and each character has his or her own abilities to get the job done. Bart can glide and grapple. Homer can grow fat and roll, or bloat up fat and float. Lisa can manipulate items within her world using her Hand of Buddha and the touch screen. And Marge has the power of persuasion - her levels are essentially a real-time strategy game where she'll call out commands and the Springfieldians will follow her lead. The satire continues with sub-levels that spoof Gauntlet, Frogger, and Space Invaders in one-off challenges.   Even though much of the game is a traditional platformer, The Simpsons Game actually feels like it incorporates the Simpsons characters extremely well for its designsomething the old-school Simpsons games failed to do. But where this game stumbles is in its challenge: levels are very straightforward in their design and - while many are laid out like puzzles, their solutions aren't difficultand with unlimited lives as well as the ability to return to the action unpunished after a death, The Simpsons Game isn't all that difficult to complete.    So, while the game can be completed in a few hours (with an ending that's a fantastic payoff), there are some elements that should increase replay for a few more. The Nintendo DS system's unique Pet Homer mini-game is a joke that goes on beyond its limit, spoofing the Nintendogs genre. But this is the item that's meant to keep players going - collecting items within a level unlocks goodies for Homer to play with, but some players might not be interested in revisiting old levels in order to snag the last of the missing icons just to see the one joke that the item activates. Then there's the multiplayer: mini-games that use both single and multi-card support...they're good extras, but nothing special.The Simpsons Game turned out surprisingly well on the Nintendo DS. Though much of what makes it good has been lifted from the console renditions (script, level ideas, voice-over), the DS developers give the handheld gamers a unique gameplay experience. It's not a hard game by any means and it's a little straightforward and short, but it offers some great chuckles all the way through.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
