This is a good thing for the coincidentally named DinoCorp, a company that suddenly discovers a rationalization for its moniker. So in they go, not for science, or exploration, or greater universal understanding, but to setup a hunting lodge and grant intergalactic hicks the opportunity to mercilessly kill some of the galaxy's toughest and rarest animals. It's good to see the principles of the twenty-first century living on in our futuristic progeny.  After a while, and a few unfortunate accidents, the trickle of incoming hunters begins to slow and then eventually stop. Realizing its planetary hunting endeavor is in jeopardy, and coming face-to-face with the grim prospect that once again the prized company insignia will be absurd and pointless, DinoCorp rounds up a bunch of the dinosaurs, packs them into a spaceship, and then travels about the galaxy in typical Ringling Brothers fashion, bringing the show to the people, and not the people to the show. Which dinosaurs do they decide to bring along? The Peacful-a-saurus? The Fuzzy-fluff-a-don? The Cuddle-a-saur? Yeah, right. More like the Sharp-tooth-destroy-a-saurus and the Murder-machine (all the other names were used up).  A few successful but uneventful stops later, we enter the universe of Carnivores Cityscape just as the sci-fi fair makes an unscheduled ~landing~ on a remote Earth colony, Crater City. An aptly named place too, as by landing, I of course meant crashing. Bad things are bound to happen when a ship full of angry dinosaurs crashes on a remote colony. Now, as players, we are charged with entering this world from either the perspective of one of these rabid dinosaurs bent on destruction, or a human agent intent on quelling the prehistoric threat. But I don't want to quell or protect! C'mon, can't I do it tomorrow?  Wait a second, this isn't a hunting game. The last three in the Carnivores series were hunting type games...sort of. But this, this is an action game -- a classic first-person shooter done twitch style. One built off of the Serious engine no less. That's quite the change, quite the folly.   Without reading the manual, it will seem as if the game just kind of begins out of nowhere. Even the most story devoid titles have some text before they start. It doesn't even have to be three paragraphs scrolling down the screen in typical Star Wars fashion, I'd settle with ~Dude, dinosaurs are all crazy, yo. Something must be done. Go get 'em, tiger!~ Instead, I appear in the forest and am trying to get to a ship, or I appear by the ship and am trying to get to the forest. Hooray for narrative.  As a human, players are afforded the opportunity to put six weapons to use (Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle, Rifle X, Sniper Rifle, and a Grenade Launcher) across five environments, each with its own set of multiple sub-missions. These environments are populated with all manner of dinosaurs in dire need of a killing (an act the aforementioned six weapons are particularly good at carrying out). Six... Let that sink in... Only six weapons. A sissy's arsenal compared to today's other games. What's worse, all of them are bland and some are terribly modeled. I like the rifle (machinegun). I don't like the shotgun (obscene, blocky, ass weapon). The term hit and miss has never been so accurately applied. There's the blue energy crap, the grenade launcher, the sniper rifle, the pistol, shotgun, and machinegun. Profound.   The arsenal wouldn't matter so much if the play was dead on, but the dinosaurs aren't particularly intelligent or scary, barring a few ~boss~ encounters. What miffs me is that they behave almost identically to Serious Sam baddies (run right at you until somebody dies). Occasionally a critter will turn tail and cower, but that often seems an act spawned more by confusion than desperation or fear.   As we know, Serious Sam action isn't bad by any means. Having hordes murderous enemies barreling at you can be quite enjoyable, in the digital world anyway. What makes that game so enthralling is that there is so much to deal with at any given time. You have to contend with several variations of foes, each with his or her own method of attack, and you have to contend with an overwhelming total number of them all. What do you get when you take out the variation and the numbers? Carnivores.   Kill a lone dinosaur. Kill a small pack of dinosaurs. But it's not about the numbers, they say. It's about walking up to your victim, sneaking up on them and then capping them in the ass! A fine philosophy provided your entities aren't as stupid as posts. Walking behind a dino and offing him, assuming he's not pointed in your direction by default, is rather simple because touching them can be accomplished without any repercussions. That's right, you can plant your face in his ass and nothing will happen. The only way to blow the stealth mode is to stand directly in front of the blasted beast or lob a grenade at his mother. Funny, because most of the dinos have side-lodged eyeballs (hell if I know the scientific term for that characteristic).      Attempting to spruce up the monotony of casual play by incorporating rescue missions (escort the loser) was a terrible, wrong, awful idea. Take the senator, for instance. Mr. Trial and Error, as I like to call him, awaits you in his office in city hall. But if you happen to stumble upon him before clearing out the vicinity of unwanted lizards, he's going to die. If you happen to linger in his office for too long, he's going to die. If you don't take the correct path out, he's going to die. If you don't have precise aim and wicked reflexes, he's going to die. See, he's feeble and he's stupid. He won't wait for you to secure the area, the second you meet him is the second he starts to tag along behind you in loveable puppy dog fashion, eager to get mauled by whatever happens to be nearby. Congratulations, you've just learned the joys of a forced level restart.  Two parts of Carnivore's combat are really cool... Jumping into a cleared pool to escape pursuit is especially amusing because dinosaurs will have no qualms with jumping in after you and then feverishly pumping their chubby legs in a water induced panic, all the while trying to keep their heads above water and still chomp you if the opportunity arises. Intentional or not, it's pretty funny to watch. The other bit of fun comes from shooting Pterodactyls flying high in the sky. With either the sniper rifle (capable of an incredible zoom) or a standard pistol, you can clip the wings of these flying beasts and watch them plummet far to the ground. The ~Teen~ rated game features no gibbing, but the thud accompanying their fall from grace is nevertheless satisfying, however fleeting it may be.  Of course, agents only comprise half of Carnivores. The other half is made up of carnivores. Beat that word mastery! Instead of being an agent, you fight them (they too relentlessly run at you, only now with projectile weapons). Six dinosaurs can be controlled. Begin as the speedy but weak Compi and advance all the way to the Giganotosaurus or Tylosaurus. Play between the critters remains relatively the same: run, attack, alternate attack, jump on ledge, eat when necessary. It's not like a box of bandages is going to do much for an Oviraptor. That's right, instead, feeding off of the corpses of other living things is vital to keeping health up, and is a nifty albeit sloppy implementation (hit detection in this department is way off).   Playable Dinos also all come with different attributes and characteristics (speed, strength, durability, etcetera). In fact, the bigger ones are a bit more difficult to maneuver (especially when strafing), and can even get caught in tight spaces, unable to turn because of their length and breadth. This makes exploring some of the games more confined areas counterproductive, but since they're all capable of being seen from the perspective of the agent, it matters little. I've yet to get my plump dino butt irreparably crammed into a tight space I couldn't get out of, but I have had to wiggle and waggle for some three minutes to free myself from precarious predicaments my curiosity got me into.  A lot of other little nuisances also show up from time-to-time. As far as I can figure, there is no save (what's automatically done between chapters not withstanding). Now, I've read the manual, checked out the readme, and randomly jabbed nearly every key on my keyboard, but have found no mid-mission save. No doubt intentionally omitted, quicksaves don't make appearances because the missions themselves scarcely take more than ten minutes to complete. Still, the option should be there. Lord knows I didn't want to play through the same levels again, I'm betting none of you, our testy readers, will want to either. And what's up with no loading or transition screen after the in-game modification of graphical settings? Contrary to popular belief, a black void that makes no noise isn't very helpful. In fact, I'm sure a lot of people might mistake it for freezing.  Which reminds me... What desktop PCs are doing in the city hall of this futuristic colony when sophisticated holographic computing is done right down the corridor is beyond me, but at least now we know why the ship originally crashed... Because it was running Windows! Get it? Because Windows...and the crashing...it kind of works both ways...and the tie in above...? Ah, to hell with it. Moving on...  Multiplayer allows for cooperative play (praise be). Always a favorite of mine, and a mode that I will applaud regardless of what it gets implemented in, cooperative play of a game's single-player campaign is an excellent addition. If only more titles would follow suite. Aside from this, only deathmatch and team deathmatch exist. Even though a game of this nature screams for a wealth of modes enhanced by inter-species play (modes that Aliens vs. Predator 2 was happy to provide), it gets none. Very standard and very saddening.      Equally saddening, Carnivores is a strange graphical mutant. Much like many of our significant others, the game begins by looking absolutely terrible (good morning, honey), but then picks up as time moves on (ooh, good afternoon, honey), and then reverts to terrible (long day at work, honey?). The cityscape is pretty, probably where the name comes from. The Serious engine upon which this game was built obviously still isn't being taxed, but the coloring, lighting, and design of the city itself are all really quite pleasing, very Project Eden-ish in its attempt at instilling a sense of verticality and using a lot of vibrant blues, reds, and yellows. The rest of the game tells a significantly different story, however.   A few nifty, but now standard graphical touches round out the otherwise rather mundane experience (infra-red goggles and passable redwoods). The tremendous luster seen in Serious Sam goes largely untapped here, which wouldn't be so dreadful had this game not been built off of that same damn engine.   Throughout, Carnivores has a suspiciously shallow, hollow, and loosely built look to it. It gives the impression that the only thing existing beyond the visible layer of polygons is an endless stretch of nothingness. Broken assemblages of blocks create creases and seams from which the void peers out. Small Compi aside (their flaws hidden by size), dinosaurs look antiquated and vastly under-articulated. I like the city. I like the underwater shrubs. I like the texturing on steel (even though the egregious detail texturing Sam was known for makes no appearance). If I were to describe the rest, I'd be fined for using the word mediocre too often.  Given the ho-hum nature of the game's aesthetics, you can imagine my surprise when I discovered it runs well only part of the time. Pathetically small levels compound the mystery of why, on a system powered by a P4, 384MB RAM, and a GeForce 3 Ti500, the title could stutter as it does. Even just setting the game to Quality (not Extreme), results in sluggish performance.    More importantly than any of this, why does the energy blast of Rifle X leave a shadow as it travels? It's a ball of freaking light!  But I can't complain about the audio, except the Compi, who all annoy the bleeding hell out of me. You see, *SHRIEK* they interrupt every *SHRIEK* few seconds just so *SHRIEK* you don't forget that they are *SHRIEK* the most annoying bastard *SHRIEK* creatures around. *SHRIEK*  What did you think of Carnivores Cityscape?  Like Sam, the music changes with the environment. Unlike Sam, it's not nearly as prominent or discernable. A lot of times nothing can be heard at all. *SHRIEK* Well, nothing except that anyway. For as lame as some of the weapons look and act, they sure sound good. I especially dug the clanging impact of bullet on steel and the way grenades exploded against rocks. Nice stuff. *SHRIEK* It's understood that when a product bases itself off of an existing technology it try and outperform, or at the very least compete with what came before it. That is, after all, why technology is licensed in the first place -- to be a base with which the delivery of technically comparable performance can be attained. The Quake 3 engine is never licensed by people who want to make a game that looks like Quake 1.Carnivores can't grasp this seemingly elementary philosophy. It's a game based off of the Serious engine, a phenomenal piece of technology, but it manages to look worse, run worse, feel worse, and be worse. Herein lies the problem. Why would a person pay twenty dollars for a mediocre game when he or she could pay twenty dollars for a stupendously awesome one (two stupendously awesome ones, in fact)? And in forsaking its hunting heritage in favor of more conventional twitch-based play, Carnivores takes the foolish stance of attempting to stand toe-to-toe with the Serious king of the bargain bin, thus forcing us all to ask that very question... Why?The answer, as you might have guessed, is that a person wouldn't opt for the lesser game. Carnivores offers nothing new, nothing innovative, and nothing that can in any way be seen as a cut above the rest. It's simply another vagrant of a game content with being branded and quickly disregarded as a passing first-person shooter. Though it miserably fails at virtually nothing, it's still filled with tiring, ordinary, repetitious, and uninspired action, something that, above all else, the game should have succeeded at. Packing a title with dinosaurs and then proceeding to offer little to nothing the way of fright and intensity should be a crime. Walk. Shoot. Bore.There are far better action offerings currently available. Seek satisfaction elsewhere.", "date": "Apr 9, 2002"}
