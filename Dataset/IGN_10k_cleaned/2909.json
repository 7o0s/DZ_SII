Whether it's because there's not enough girls playing games yet or because there's not enough games for the girls who are playing, game makers just put much into their girl games. In many cases, the developers even seem ashamed that they're doing kiddie, girlie games. Of course, it doesn't help much that they don't get much credit when these developers do put their hearts into games made for young girls, which is why we were eager to praise WayForward for their unexpectedly enjoyable Sabrina The Animated Series. The crafty witch Sabrina is back on a handheld, this time from Ubi Soft. Does she still have magic in her fingertips?  Features  16 levels of magical challenges Journey through stages such as the Spellman's house, Sabrina's school, the pizzeria, and more. Four mini-games and a special make-a-potion challenge Only for Game Boy Advance   Well, does she? Not quite. But don't take that as an indication that this one has no charms -- Ubi Soft is one of the best designers of games for girls in the business, and Sabrina: Potion Commotion comes from their usual spell book. It's enjoyable, but the French developers seem to have left some holes by rushing this brew, and the gameplay is just too simple to leave much else in the cauldron.  What bummed me out about this latest Sabrina (which is based mostly on the TV series starring Melissa Joan Hart, not the cartoon series or Archie comic) is that it just didn't capture the bubbly characters from the show. The smart aleck cat Salem hasn't got any of his wit in the dialog sequences here, and the wily Aunt Hilda has lost her fire (not to mention that Hilda isn't even on the show anymore, alas and alack.) Even the star, Sabrina, is just some tall blondie jumping around in a vague (but colorful) world that doesn't seem like anywhere in particular from the show. The opening sequence has Hilda casting a love spell to find herself a man that accidentally goes wrong ... sure, that gets us going on a mission, but the show at least comes up with a clever way of having the spell backfire. Here, Hilda just turns to ice and off Sabrina goes to find floating pages of a book. Alright ...  It's average platforming fun from then on -- Sabrina must get past the wacky magic shenanigans of bewitched toasters, spellbound basketballs and enchanted bugs. The gameplay is a little stiff and a lot simplistic, but for young girls who often see the worst games ever made stuffed in their Christmas stockings, having something at least as playable as Ubi Soft's Sabrina is at least something. Along the way, there's a good deal of puzzles to distract you from the average gameplay, although they're all the same puzzles you usually see in these quickie games -- and I'm not sure why developers think girls like playing Memory or Simon Says anymore than the rest of us, but those old standbys show up here. I think I only found one platforming section that struck me as original -- a section where Sabrina's jumping ability was lost and she had to figure out new ways around the stage without jumping -- but the number of special spells that Sabrina can cast do give gamers things to do along the way.She's not much of a looker, and she hasn't got any special magic in her step. I can't think of many good reasons to praise or recommend this game. That said, there's plenty of games that I would for sure NOT recommend, and this isn't one of those at all. It's just a very average game, with vivid but unimaginative stages and a lack of Sabrina flair (add in a second character with poofier hair and a slightly smaller nose and this could be a Mary-Kate and Ashley game). Most gamers of any age or play group can let this one fly by, but for young girls who don't have many other GBA games for their car trips, this one may have a small bit of dazzle for them.", "date": "Sep 11, 2002"}
