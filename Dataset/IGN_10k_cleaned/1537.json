However, in Hasbro Interactive's NASCAR Heat, which seemingly came out of the blue, we finally get a game that has qualities that should appeal to both the simulation and casual fan almost equally.   Gameplay  In what should please diehard NASCAR and simulation fans, the game has been given an amazingly large feature set and the gameplay is fully customizable. The console version of the game isn't quite as deep as its PC cousin, but that's kind of expected and it's still pretty loaded. First, the game has four different difficulty levels that range from Rookie to Legend. Rookie is overly easy as it's near impossible to not finish in first on this setting, while Legend is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum as most gamers will find it bordering on impossible to beat. Simply running a clean and error-free race isn't enough to come out victorious here, as skilled-driving and effective use of drafting plays a key role in the outcome of the races.   Second, the game contains a nice set of play modes that include single race, a championship season and two original gameplay modes in the form of Beat the Heat and Race the Pro. The single race mode lets players take on the competition on any of the game's nearly 20 real-life NASCAR tracks with any one of the 25-plus real drivers that are included in the game. Races can also be customized to be of various different lengths lasting anywhere from four to over 400 laps depending on the venue and can be played with Wear on or off.   The seasons are equally as customizable, so gamers looking for a easy, fast-paced arcade fun can turn off the Wear, tune down the difficulty level and trim down the number of laps to get a quick and fearless ride. While simulation fans can turn on the Wear, up the Pack Size, and turn up the number of laps to get more of a realistic NASCAR Racing experience. The only things that might turn off simulation fans are the facts that there's not really a way to adjust the game's racing physics, which are generally much too forgiving and arcade-like, especially when compared to the NASCAR sims on the PC. Additionally, the level of customization that can be done with the cars in between races isn't quite as detailed as it could be when compared to other NASCAR sims. All the same, this is somewhat forgivable given that the game's AI on the Legend level requires players to take turns more realistically and depend on drafting much more than any other NASCAR-based console game.    The aspect of this game that really sets it apart from its competitors is its unique Beat the Heat mode. With this mode, players are given a variety of challenges that begin with some easy challenges that are slowly and gradually increased with difficulty. The challenges are very similar to the License Tests in Gran Turismo, in that it has players do things like a complete a single turn or set of turns under a certain time limit with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards. One of the most interesting things learned from this play mode is that while NASCAR tracks are seemingly bland and uneventful because of their oval designs, there is a lot of skill involved in how each of the corners are taken. And what's more, you'll learn that taking a corner well can make a huge difference in the time it takes to get around the track.   NASCAR Heat's other novel feature is its Race the Pros mode that lets players race against ghost cars of real-life racers on different tracks of the drivers' choice. There's nothing really amazing here, but it's a nice little added feature that helps extend the game's overall play value, as it's pretty cool to do these one-on-one against the pros.   Graphics  Visually speaking, there's not really that much here that's pleasing to the eyes. The car models are decent and some of the textures are quite detailed and accurate, but the game on the whole is just plain ugly. The framerate is fairly constant and doesn't ever really drop even when you have the number of cars in the packs up as high as 14, but it's constant framerate is never really fast or entirely smooth. The game also suffers greatly from horrible draw-in problems and low-res textures that can be seen on the infields the stadiums and the opponent cars when they're far away. The game's just not that pretty.   Sound  NASCAR Heat has been given a very upbeat soundtrack that's pleasant to listen to but it's still far from spectacular. While there's nothing wrong with the songs in the game and none of the music ever gets really annoying or bothersome, it's just nothing that will inspire anything in anyone. Similarly, the game's audio effects are also nothing that will impress. The engine noises are passable and there's a lot of chatter from your pit crew that will tell you to stop hitting the wall or let you know if someone's trying to pass you high or low, but the collision sounds that happen when you're either making contact with other cars or the wall simply leave a lot to be desired and seem rather bland and just flat out unrealistic.  NASCAR Heat definitely does a lot of things that will please both simulation fans and arcade fans alike, but in the end it doesn't quite do enough for either. People looking for a pure arcade-style racer will find that there's a lot better in this area on PlayStation, while people looking for a pure simulation will likely find that Heat lacks some key features that users look for in a simulation -- such as more realistic racing physics and a fairly lackluster level of customization level with the cars. Nevertheless, the game is a lot of fun to play and the combination of the in-depth Championship mode with the enormously fun and addictive Beat the Heat mode, makes NASCAR Heat a very enjoyable and highly replayable game. It might not completely appeal to the extreme hardcore sim or arcade fan, but it has a lot to offer for people that like nice mixture of both.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
