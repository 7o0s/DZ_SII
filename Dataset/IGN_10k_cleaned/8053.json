Nintendo fans are likely familiar with Advance Wars. The series has been published by the Big N on the Game Boy Advance and the DS, and features unit-directing grid-based combat on the level of a much more complicated game of chess. Military Madness is made from the same mold. This game came to the TurboGrafx just as the '90s were born, and brought with it the same style of gameplay that faithful Nintendo followers wouldn't get to experience for themselves until 2001.   Moon tank vs. Moon tank: Who wins? There are a few key differences -- Advance Wars has a square grid overlaying its tactical terrains, but Military Madness honeycombs each arena with hexagons. The setting is a bit different, too, as AW is mostly modern in its units and environments, while MM takes place in the future, on the moon. Fighting on the lunar surface doesn't make much of a gameplay difference, as you'd think the one-sixth Earth's gravity might make driving a Panzer a tougher job -- but there are plenty of other ways Military Madness innovates.   The first is in its terrain recognition. Your units get a bonus to both their offensive and defensive potential based on the defensibility of their position; taking the higher ground and attacking an enemy stranded on an open plain means a considerable advantage for your troops. Yeah, whatever, old news, right? Advance Wars does that too, but a full decade after this game did. Plus, Advance Wars doesn't do innovation number two, which is an additional combat bonus applied by the proximity of other units.   Normally you'd think that unit-based combat is one-dimensional. One unit slugs it out with one other unit, each exchange happening independent of any others. But in Military Madness your forces get more powerful if they attack near their allies -- if my tank squad attacks the enemy's foot soldiers, its assault will cause more casualties if another, friendly tank squad is sitting just one space over. It makes sense. Call it a morale boost, or flanking, or whatever, but it's just understandable that an individual phalanx of warriors would be more combat-ready if they were surrounded by a swarm of their fellows.    For true devastation, trap your opponent on either side in a pincer attack. That'll send them to the graveyard fast. Units gain experience over time through surviving multiple battles, you get a comfortable progression of difficulty and complexity as the game's campaign continues, and a two-player mode means taking on your friends in a battle of wits without having to set up any rows of wooden pawns.Overall Military Madness is a lot of fun and certainly worth a look if you're a fan of turn-based, grid-based, moon-based strategy.", "date": "Feb 15, 2007"}
