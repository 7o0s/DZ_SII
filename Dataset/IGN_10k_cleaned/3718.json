Jim starred as the ~shovel enthusiast~ in Dig It, and now he's back as budding gemologist in Jewels and Jim--a game that manages to buck the trend of bad games with cutesy titles.  Features: Action/puzzle gameplay Multiple levels Save your progress  This generation of cellphones has a firm handle on two genres: simple action games and puzzlers. So why not combine the two? THQ Wireless' Jewels and Jim does so, and manages to shake up a genre cocktail that really, really works. You are little Jim, stuck in a labyrinth of puzzle rooms, forced to collect jewels if you want to ever escape.  Each of the game's plentiful rooms are under lock and key, and typically, the only way to reveal the path to the key is by collecting all of the jewels in sight. Naturally, this is an easy task for the first dozen or so levels. The game slowly introduces you to a few gameplay concepts before really throwing brainbusters your way. Some rooms contain switches that unlock pathways. Some rooms contain secret passages that are found by trial and error.  And other rooms contain roving beasties with one goal: steal Jim's bling. Fortunately, Jim is equipped with a blaster than makes short work of these gelatinous blobs, but it's limited range must be taken into consideration when going into showdown mode. You can't just start squeezing them off, you must actually take time to aim and make your shot count, because these monsters have a tendency to move a little faster and smoother than you do.  With brings us to a nagging complaint about Jewels and Jim. The control is kinda loose. You can just press in one direction and Jim will keep on going, waiting until you either point him in another direction or he hits a wall.  That's fine for Pac-Man, but it doesn't work well with this little puzzler. Too often, you fudge directions on the tiny touchpad.  A little practice will likely get you over the hump, and the game laying just beyond is actually worth the time. If you dig puzzler games and are completely burnt out on Tetris, Jewels and Jim makes a nice alternative. And for fans of Dig It, you'll certainly appreciate the way the two games are related.  Same character, similar screen displays, etc. Do we smell franchise?  Jewels and Jim looks decent. Nothing that will make your eyeballs bleed, but the graphics definitely get the job done. It's fairly colorful, and all of the sprites are well-defined--certainly better than they were in Dig It, thanks to the simpler backgrounds. Unfortunately, Jewels and Jim is a rather quiet adventure, as our Jim is too busy hittin' switches and collectin' riches to make a peep. Action puzzlers are a worthy genre for cellphone gaming to get into, and Jewels and Jim does well to lead the way.  (However, after a few screens, it made me start hoping for a redux of BoulderDash.) The title is simple enough to easily get into, and as the puzzles get harder, your interest in the game will grow, as you really don't want to be beaten by a little no-nothing mascot like Jim.", "date": "Jun 17, 2003"}
