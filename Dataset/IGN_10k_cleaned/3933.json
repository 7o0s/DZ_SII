A PC market absolutely starved for solid RPGs finally turns to the console market to get a fix. Embarrassing as it may be, SquareSoft is doing a pretty good job of showing PC owners what the console RPG is all about with their first PC translation, Final Fantasy VII.As a direct copy of the PlayStation game of the same name, Final Fantasy VII shows the positive and negative marks of its heritage.Let's take a look at those positives. Final Fantasy VII is (obviously) the most recent in a long line of successful RPG titles for the console systems. The game uses a formula that is tried and true. The storyline is both coherent and entertaining (fairly novel for the increasingly ridiculous RPG genre) and unfolds from one scene to the next with the smoothness of a major motion picture. The game's visuals and special effects are also easy to compare to a movie's, providing players with breathtaking breaks and plot advancements throughout the game. Even past these superficial layers, Final Fantasy VII offers a great deal to players.Final Fantasy VII's movement system is simple and effective, and after a short while becomes almost completely invisible. Players move through the game, occasionally running into enemies that they have to fight, finding new friends, loosing others, and basically keeping the story moving. The combat system is very basic, enabling each character to select an attack every so often, and then displaying the results of that attack on-screen with some pretty amazing special effects. And so the game goes, move, kill, find item, kill, move, the storyline broken up every so often by the appearance of a really special monster that takes everything the team has to defeat. As I said before, a typical console RPG.And that's really the only problem with Final Fantasy VII  the game just doesn't offer a complete RPG experience. While it may be enough for console gamers to be herded down a path towards an inevitable goal, PC roleplaying fans are more accustomed to non-linear titles that allow them to create their own story. Although there's no doubt that this game is perfect in almost every way technically, it just doesn't have the depth of most good RPGs (in fact, most of our office was able to finish the game within 30 hours).Almost anyone who enjoys a good storyline, great graphics and a solid soundtrack is going to like Final Fantasy VII, as long as they go in expecting something between a standard RPG and a graphic adventure. Players who have been waiting for the next Might & Magic, Ultima, or Wizardry will find that the game's ultra-linear storyline and derivative gameplay offer no new challenges or surprises.-- Trent C.
