The last six months have witnessed the rebirth of long dormant franchises, giving rise to titles like Lemmings Revolution, Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, and Bust a Move 4.  Even the lowly Puzzle Bobble 2X has mysteriously crept into retail outlets on budget by way of Interplay's affiliate label program.  With so much good stuff floating around, how's a discriminating consumer to locate the pick of the litter?  Luckily for you, IGNPC's around to crash test the products and point out junk like Time Out Games before it finds a home in a shopping bag.  Profit-minded publishers pick one basic concept to develop a puzzler around, fleshing it out extensively to produce a decent game.  Legacy Interactive's elected to go the opposite route, slapping together a pack of 10 bite-sized mindbenders designed for play during a coffee break or moment of boredom (hence the Time Out in the title).  As opposed to pleasing one segment of this fine nation's population, they've gone for the gusto, using the 'something for everyone' approach.  Mama mia.. you'd think by now that if this option wasn't working overly well for Microsoft's puzzle packs, somebody behind the scenes might have taken note.  Once more unto the breach, or so they say.  Boredom takes many forms when you finally get to the meat of the program.  Eight Away, best described as a variant of solitaire that's played in reverse, kicks off the festivities.  Trudging in right behind it comes Darts, a castrated version of the traditional pub pasttime wherein you click to aim, then hold down the mouse button to determine accuracy.  Catch is, you've got to strike numbered portions of the playing field in order and can't simply aim for the bullseye or small niche targets.  There's no beer either, which is just about the only thing that makes darts worthwhile.  Scrabble groupies will want to have a go at Spelling Bee and One-Minute Words, though they'll definitely leave disappointed.  The former challenges you to spell out words by highlighting interconnecting honeycombs, while the latter functions according to similar mechanics, although it uses a sliding puzzle as a game board.  Yawn.  Next up is Miner, an insipid cross between Dig Dug and Lode Runner.  As the wrinkled fogey, your job is to recover gold, blast holes through solid rock, and pump shotgun rounds into bloodthirsty animals.  Admittedly, the action's preferable to the sort found in It Takes A Thief, the closest thing the bundle offers to a strategy game, but that's not saying much.  Above the muck rise the textbook puzzlers, including Tryangles, 4 Orbs, and Balloon Pop.  Out of the lot, 4 Orbs is the most promising (vexing, too), as patience and concentration are necessary to manipulate colored balls into slots with the mouse functioning as a high powered magnet.  Tryangles doesn't stray far from this formula either, throwing obstacles and death balls in your path, demanding that triangle shaped wedges be raised & lowered to open up a clear path whereby multi-hued spheres can travel to like-colored targets.  Balloon Pop, on the other hand, involves lining up balloons of similar pattern in rows or columns so that they can be popped.  The trick is trying to eliminate the buggers in a scientific order so that none are left when the helium clears.  Finally, closing out the freak show is No Way, a corny, yet pleasing trivia game that leaves much to be desired, though you can tell it didn't aspire towards greatness.  Speaking of not setting high goals, how about that presentation?  This game's not ugly per se, but it only runs in a window and has kind of a Duckman meets an Arizona Iced Tea label kind of thing going for it. Quaint, jazzy music plays in the background, mercifully drowning out the old men or bees that chime in with lame zingers or ambient sound effects. Let's just say that the FBI can start broadcasting this stuff the next time they run into some militia group.  Families need entertainment too, it's no lie, but they deserve better than this. Owners have the option to download additional content from the internet, but why would anyone want to?  If a round of bridge with grandma or afternoon watching the grass grow is not your cup of tea, avoid Time Out Games like the plague.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
