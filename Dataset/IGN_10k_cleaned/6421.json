There's certainly no lack of emergency brake in this game, and you'll be throwing up plenty of dirt as you scream around sharp corners trying to pass such colorful characters as Hemp Girl, Radiation Boy, and Colonel Slanders.  This is the game that promised to break all of the PC 3D barriers...the game that made the press all bug-eyed at '97's E3.  So what took it so long to come out.  Well, Ratbag wanted to make sure they got it right and, after playing the final version, I can tell you that they certainly ended up with what they were going for.   Set in a slightly futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, Powerslide puts you in control of one of six highly-stylized and extremely powerful vehicles.  You'll speed through a variety of tracks (including a long dry riverbed, a couple of urban landscapes, and an abandoned mine) and, as you progress through the higher difficulty levels, you will unlock even more cars and tracks.  There are a total of nine tracks (including a stunt track) and over 30 different drivers, each with their own unique personality and driving style.  Powerslide lets you race against up to 7 computer-controlled opponents, 7 human opponents, or a combination of the two.  Although the tracks are rather sparse, the landscapes are awe-inspiring and the incredibly detailed textures make it seem as if you're driving through a fully rendered CGI.  Using a new graphics engine called the Difference Engine, Powerslide delivers unbelievable speed while at the same time offering players artistic quality extremely rare in a racing game. The game will run at 60 fps while serving up 300,000 polygons per second, most of which are used in generating the track surface. In fact, everything in the actual game is made of polygons...there's not a sprite to be found. This requires a great deal of painting to keep realistic, and up to 15 MB of textures can be found in each track.  Knowing that games can't survive on looks alone, the designers at Ratbag also focused a lot of attention on the sound in Powerslide.  For example, when you're racing in the mine level, the sound of your engine reverberates off of the cave walls and the sounds actually change character in different environments.  One of the biggest complaints from recent 3D accelerated games is that they are full of eye-candy, but provide these incredible visuals at the expense of gameplay.  This is definitely not the case with Powerslide.  Ratbag has taken special care to make sure this racer plays just as well as it looks and you'll truly be amazed by the real-life physics models used in this game.  You'll spin out if you give it too much gas, your car will crawl up the edges of inclines due to centrifugal force, and the back end of your super-powered dune buggy will slide out from underneath you if you round a corner too sharply, leaving you in the dust of your opponents.  Another one of the major improvements Powerslide offers over other racers is its AI, which is actually intelligent.  Described as individual ~mini-brains~ by Powerslide Producer Greg Siegele, each of the opposing racers has an AI that was 'bred' over time by the programmers.  These unique algorithms actually helped the computer drivers to 'learn' key maneuvers on each track, giving them advantages over rookies who have never raced in a particular location.   The only complaint that I have about Powerslide is how quickly the difficulty changes as you progress through the courses.  The easy courses are just that...extreme easy.  While the advanced course can be nightmarish at first, the novice courses hardly prepare you for the turns, jumps, and spills found in the advanced courses. And you might as well forget about the Insane difficulty setting ... unless you truly are mad when it comes to racing.  It almost seems as if there is a medium difficulty setting missing in the middle and you'll definitely find yourself racing the Devil's Elbow and Mineshafted courses several times before completing them in one of the top three slots.  But, in all, this is a minor problem and you'll probably enjoy racing the same courses just because they look so darn good...and the massive curves make laying a few tires that much more satisfying.    With its incredible graphics, superior control system, and adaptable AI, Powerslide really stands out in a flooded PC racer market.  This game is beautiful, it's challenging, and, most importantly, it's fun.  Powerslide will definitely satisfy any of you who like arcade-style racers, and the physics models are so good that you sim fans may even want to check this one out.  Sure, it's no NASCAR, but you really do get the feeling of slinging yourself around dirt tracks at over 100 MPH, and that's a lot more than I can say for most of the racing games out there.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Dec 23, 1998"}
