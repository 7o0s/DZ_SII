But when I heard that there was something new being released in boxed form using the aging Myth II engine, I was a bit skeptical. Not only because of the aforementioned engine, but also because the game was set in the Vietnam War. Would the Myth II engine work to satisfy a game that relies entirely on ranged combat? Not really. I just want to go home at this point so I can get the chance to wash the taste of Green Berets from my brain. Lackluster AI, along with game mechanics that just don't work with this engine combine to make a game that I just didn't really care about.  There are undoubtedly a lot of you out there that have played the Myth series over the last few years. You'll also know that both the original and the second of the series were really incredibly rich games in story and gameplay value. The Myth engine was a pretty good piece of work for the time and really shined for the medieval and fantasy type of warfare that involved arched projectiles and hand to hand combat. The same can not be said for ranged combat with bullets that shoot straight.   This created a couple of problems. First off, the rule of ~if you can shoot them, they can shoot you~ is a pretty solid one. You're going to get hurt. A lot. Your medic is going to be a busy little bee as long as you poke your pretty little heads out to take a shot at the enemy. For if they do manage to get a shot off before your crack troops manage to take them out, chances are extremely good that you'll be hit. This might not be such a problem were the number of enemy troops running through the levels a little bit lower.   The friendly and enemy AI also have a lot of problems with actually getting a clear shot at each other. There're just times that your forces just aren't smart enough to go look for a clear shot through to the enemy troops. They'll sit there firing round after round into the hill sitting in between the two. Maybe go to the top of the hill? Maybe go around the hill? Something please... With arrows and bombs in Myth, this never really created a problem due to the arch of the shots.  Tactical decisions here are somewhat limited as well. First off, you know you have to shoot from a distance, so you have to find the best place to sit and fire. Basically this means you'll need to get on higher ground. No point to directing your troops to find cover behind the sparse Vietnam jungle (what? the jungles are thick in real life? hmmm...) as your troops will have just as much trouble firing around the trees as the enemies, and when you finally direct your units around the trees for a clear shot... well, you give the enemy a clear shot as well. And while I'm all for fair play, this is just stupid.  Of course, there are some special weapons that your troops carry with them to help things out just a little like grenade launchers so that you have at least a little bit of ammo you can lob at grouped enemy units. However, actually aiming correctly is a challenge unto itself. You have to aim at the ground halfway to where you want your grenade to land making both distance and direction hard to judge. Of course, the Viet Cong have their own weapons to lob at you and they're much better at aiming. First off, your troops are going to get shelled a few times with the mortars before you even have time to see where the damn things came from and can react to them. Then, while your trying to aim and fire a grenade back in a friendly exchange of ideas, you'll probably get up close and personal to his idea before yours even reaches him. They recommend using one of your faster units to rush these mortar units and take them out as you might have in Myth with melee units receiving fire from ranged. But I never once got close enough to even get a shot off at the mortar units let alone kill one with rifle fire. So it pretty much came down to saving and finding where exactly the unit was and then loading up and firing a grenade onto the spot that you remember him being. There's no instantaneous reactions here for tactical creativity as there were in Myth II. Trial and error rule the day.  So with the gameplay not really the most spectacular thing on the menu, you're probably wondering about the graphics and sound. It's the Myth II engine. I mentioned it was aging, right? It looks its age. Throwing this up against newer and prettier engines is kind of like comparing a bright shiny new orange to one that's been sitting on the counter for a couple of months. While I still may eat that sucker if I'm hungry enough, it's not going to be pretty. All that said, they've done a fairly good job creating new unit and tree art considering what they had to work with.  Now the sound is another matter. Aside from the fact that the Myth II music is used in several places, such as the end of the missions and at the start menu, the sound really isn't that good. Voice-overs aren't necessarily goofy, but the lack of emotion made me want to either laugh or cry in despair that life was so boring for the voice behind the briefings.   Story? Not really. There's a little bit holding the missions together, but really this is all about your squad of highly trained soldiers heading into battle to kick a little butt.  With little character, no real point of interest, that aging engine, and game mechanics that just don't work to create interesting and unique tactical combat situations, Green Berets just comes out short in the end in pretty much all areas. But hey, as I said in the strapline, at least you get a full copy of Myth II with the purchase, which is still a great tactical real time strategy game. So there is something of value here.  -- Kip Merriweather Want to share your opinions with the world?
