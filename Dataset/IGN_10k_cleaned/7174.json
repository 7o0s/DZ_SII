After the summer campaign kick-off with Frogger, Galaga, Pac-Man and more, Microsoft and its partners have kept up the pace with weekly updates, even if the games are beginning to dip into the less popular well of coin-op ~classics.~ The latest, Time Pilot, is a perfect example of an arcade game that could have easily been left in its dusty, unplayed, original stand-up arcade unit without a translation to the Xbox 360. Konami's shooter consists of a decent original port, an excellent new HD upgrade, and a substandard online mode, all comprising a cheap ($5) but un-compelling addition to the XBLA archives.   Time Pilot is a 2D shooter that's closest to a top-down visual style. The ship you control remains in the screen's center as enemy crafts fly toward you. The premise is that you have to save the world and, by doing so, you must travel to various time zones to blast as many generic planes, helicopters, spaceships and UFOs, including a boss for each level, to prevent Earth's destruction. Very old premise, very old arcade game. But it nonetheless holds to the XBLA standards: It's easy to pick up and play, there is no need for instructions, and it's been up-resed, and fixed with leaderboards, an online mode, Achievements and more.    Old school... The online mode is useful to an extent: You can play online and it's decent fun for about 10 minutes or so. But there is noticeable lag that does hamper gameplay. Honestly, if you didn't love this game the first time around, it's unlikely you'll fall in love with it now. A co-op online version is also available, which might be preferable to the versus mode. I'm not crazy about either. The initial buzz wears off quickly. Another bummer: I was able to snag all but one of the 10 Achievements within 20 minutes. I like Achievements, but these were really simplistic goals (beat a level, get an achievement, hit 10 bombs in level 1, hit 20 missiles in level 2, etc.), and they weren't as intelligently applied as other arcade games.    The two versions of the game represent the old version in its classic pixelly visual style, and a new version, featuring new graphics and sound. Both are moderately compelling in their own ways. The old version is fun so you can re-live the past -- and to see if you can still land on the high score list. The new version steps things up a bit. It's not just an up-resed game. Instead, the backgrounds are totally new. You'll see good-looking plumes of smoke from ships on fire, decent explosions, and some of the prettiest layered set of arcade clouds around. The new sound effects are also preferable over the old ones, even though a direct hit to an enemy sounds like a balloon popping in both versions. Five minutes of that gets real old fast.   New...old school. Another nice touch is the ability to stretch the screen farther than any other XBLA game to date, giving people the ability to fill up at least some of the space on their wide-screen HD TVs. You can stretch the game screen's width and length, but be careful, when playing online the split-screen extends right past the monitor's limit, preventing you from properly playing the game right. (Again, you can just simply re-adjust your screen in the menu box to fix it).    Time Pilot is an OK game that's probably worth $5 if a) you're bored; b) you love old school stuff no matter the subject; c) or you simply can't help yourself when it comes to gobbling up easy Achievements. Otherwise, skip it. It's a super ~meh~ game. There are plenty of excellent shooters on XBLA worth your while that don't require a rocky trip down memory lane.", "date": "Aug 31, 2006"}
