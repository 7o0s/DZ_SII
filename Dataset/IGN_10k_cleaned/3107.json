There's no doubt Neversoft's extreme sports series is one of the most important franchises in recent videogame history, but that's an awful lot of skateboarding in a short period of time. With Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 we're surely given the most refined trick system in the series so far, but there's no denying all of that skating is beginning to run together in the minds of Xbox owners (it's scrambled our brains)   There's more of everything you love in Tony Hawk 4, but it's still not enough to make us appreciate it significantly more than Hawk 3. It's like having Jennifer Lopez's sister on your tip when you're already with J Lo herself. One or the other is fine, but having both means one is going to waste; although I'd force myself to come up with a solution to the Lopez situation. Anyway, the leap in graphics, audio and replay value from Tony Hawk 3 (released in March of 2002) is more like a skip, but the catch is, that last Hawk game is generally regarded as the best the series has to offer. A handful of new tricks, enhanced control scheme and gigantic levels highlight the best of Tony Hawk 4.   Gameplay  The career mode received a major overhaul designed to both accommodate the size of the levels and to more or less keep up with innovations from the competition. Now in career mode, just as we saw in Acclaim's Aggressive Inline, you have an entire level open to you with no timer and all the freedom you need to mess around and explore until you're ready to accept a challenge from one of the characters hanging out somewhere. The brilliance of this system means you can accept any challenge at any time --even in the middle of another challenge-- and perhaps even come back to a particularly difficult one after you've booster your skater's ratings. Similarly all of the characters you see with blue arrows over their heads in a level don't necessarily represent all of the characters/challenges ultimately available in that level. Completing the first batch of initial challenges opens up other, more difficult challenges elsewhere in the level.    We would call the characters in the levels non playable, but some of them are pro skaters available in the game who have especially difficult and rewarding challenges for you. Completing their challenges will yield a new special trick or new ramps and obstacles you can then toggle in and out of the level.  The trick system is Tony Hawk 4 is refined to the point that veterans of the series will definitely get the most out of it. The size of the levels is intimately tied to the new trick system since you'll have the moves you'll need to get from one end of a level to the other and back again all on one combo run and you're encouraged to do so. Rewarding creative players who can see and work combos all over the level is the essence of what makes Tony Hawk so popular to begin with.  New or casual players will quickly want to become serious Tony Hawk veterans once they see the game's demo mode running or one of the skater videos available through unlocking. But like the Hawk games before it, the career mode serves as a step by step tutorial in ~How to Kick Ass at Tony Hawk~ by presenting increasingly difficult challenges at a steady pace as you boost skater ratings and get more comfortable with the game. The control scheme hasn't changed in a year but you will need to get more comfortable with the triggers since you need both to pull off the brand new spine transfer maneuver and the game encourages this move repeatedly.   Pulling off hundreds of thousands of points will be a cinch with all of the moves you can string together with reverts, manuals and flatland tricks so the most annoying challenges in career mode tend to have nothing to do with pulling off tricks and scoring points. Every level has its challenge or two or three that will get your blood boiling --especially rookies-- because either a) it involves no skill other than steering your skater or b) there's no indication anywhere of what the hell you're supposed to do or c) both.  All of the levels themselves are bigger than any Tony Hawk level that's come before but the variety is outstanding since every single one of them has its own unique flavor and feel. Wide open spaces, vertical obstacles and teleportals are mixed and matched in ways that keep things fresh. When you first encounter a new level, its specific angles and lines and flow will be a little intimidating --mainly because you've been playing the previous level for such an extended period of time trying to unlock the new one-- because it will be such a dramatic departure from what you've just seen. This is a good thing. As a point of comparison the Los Angeles level of Hawk 3 compares favorably in feel and design, but not in size, to the College level --the first level-- of Hawk 4. By the time you open up Alcatraz, which is perhaps the most impressive Tony Hawk level yet, with its true-to-life scale, wild angles and teleportals you won't remember a thing about what made that first level cool.     Any discussion of the multiplayer game has to begin and end with what isn't in Tony Hawk 4. The fact that there is no online play in this game is bad in and of itself but it hurts Xbox owners even more since Hawk 4 is now the second time Activision has gone back on their Xbox Live promise. If Hawk 4 can work well on the PlayStation 2 with uploadable (that should be a word regardless of what MS Word says) created skate parks and buddy lists, then this game could rock the block with Xbox Live compatibility. Plus it's frustrating that Xbox owners can still find menu options for taunting and hosting games?.for system link play.  Graphics  The Tony Hawk series has never been a pretty one, but this season's game has at least refined the character models and levels from what we saw in the previous edition. Skaters will now show the effects of repeated bails and crashes with ripped clothing and bruised and bloodied limbs. While this is a nice effect you'll only notice it occasionally since most of the damage takes place on the front of the body and the default camera is setup behind the character. The bloody elbows however, are quite nice.   Unless you can figure it out by name or remember it from an old game, you have to see a trick in Tony Hawk to get an appreciation for the move. The character animation is the same, mainly because you're seeing many of the same tricks from previous editions of the game. New tricks like the Sproing manual are very clean and easy to identify and make for nice surprises when you first see them.  While the framerate in Hawk 4 is solid throughout, the locked on camera still has the same problems of getting jammed up in corners and other tight places at times. In fact, a few times we noticed the camera acting as if it had a mind of its own where it would zoom in far too closely and wouldn't adjust even when we used the right analog stick to reposition it.   Sound  The sound effects are subtle but work very well and the built-in soundtrack fills in nicely since there are very few voices to listen to during this game.   Activision's soundtrack tries to offer something for everybody and probably a lot of nothing for somebody with its collection of classic rock 'n roll, hip hop and punk tunes. The game's built in soundtrack is a big deal for GameCube and PS2 owners, so much so that Activision issued a press release detailing the song list, but for Xbox owners, customized soundtracks will inevitably be the way to go. But if you can't find some of your old Gang Starr and De La Soul CDs but you can do without the vocally challenged, scratchy rocker tunes then being able to toggle certain songs in and out of that built-in soundtrack will be a godsend.  Voice samples of characters and pro skaters in the game are well done. The game also does a good job of automatically raising and lowering the volume of music, sound effects and speech samples as the situation dictates.  Tony Hawk 4 is by far the best skateboarding title around and head and shoulders above its ~me-too~ competition. I just don't think there's enough newness here for a casual Xbox gamer to drop another $50 so soon after buying Tony Hawk 3 and we're still not playing the Hawkman online yet. If ever there was a game that could benefit from steady doses of downloadable content through a service like Xbox Live it's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. What serious Hawk fan wouldn't be willing to buy a game once and keep upgrading it with new levels, for a small fee even, for months to come? In the end, the Tony Hawk series' biggest drawback is that number 4 is facing strong competition from number 3 on the Xbox. Hawk 4 is the best the series has to offer, but if you picked up Hawk 3 anytime in the last six months, then I wouldn't be in any hurry to rush out and pay full price for this game at this time. For all but the most ardent Tony Hawk fans, it makes more sense to wait awhile and see what other upcoming games may tickle your fancy because there are plenty of other holiday titles vying for your dollar that would do more for your library.", "date": "Oct 25, 2002"}
