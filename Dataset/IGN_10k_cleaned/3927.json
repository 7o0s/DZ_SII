{"name": "XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association", "name_review": "XGRA Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/22/xgra-review", "text": "Think about futuristic videogame racers for a minute. What comes to mind? Wipeout? Yes. F-Zero? Sure. But what about Acclaim's Extreme G franchise? Admittedly, the series got off to a slow start when it debuted on Nintendo 64 so many years ago, but the third installment, XG3 for PlayStation 2 and GameCube, was fast, intuitive and pretty, which is why it earned rock-solid ratings of 8.4 and 8.5 on IGNPS2 and IGNcube respectively. In fact, XG3 lacked only in depth -- it served up a mere 10 circuits and no gameplay-extending alternative modes in between, and it was primarily for this reason that it didn't score higher.  Fast forward. Developer Acclaim Cheltenham has attempted to correct that oversight for the official sequel, XGRA (or Extreme Gravity Racing Association, if you must know). The title features more of the sound-barrier-breaking bikes and unconventional twisting, looping, spiraling track designs from before. It's got an enhanced team mode and an actual storyline. It has an improved weapon system too. But there are some other changes in place that we believe are for the worse. The sensation of speed has weakened considerably by comparison to XG3 due in large to a more sluggish fluidity. Control isn't as tight. Even visuals have taken a hit. So how does everything balance out? Keep reading.  Gameplay In a future where Extreme Gravity Racing has become more popular than football and soccer combined, the go-to-place is the Sports Interactive News Network (or SiNN). SiNN serves as the backbone for the limited story and leagues featured in Acclaim's racer. The entire game is presented so that it feels as if you're watching a television show, which is a novel idea. However, it's not always clear what the storyline is or should be. There are no real pre-game cut-scenes or story-driving dialogues between teams or racers. The game begins with little background in regard to what you're doing or why you're supposed to be doing it. SiNN exists. The XGRA exists. Now race, damn you! This is disappointing only because Acclaim promised that XGRA would -- unlike its predecessor -- give us a sense of racing purpose by way of a well-integrated, inspiring storyline. Good luck finding it. We couldn't. That said, most racing fans probably won't miss it regardless; they're here for the speed, not the words.   There are some immediate changes that XG3 fans will take notice of right out. The main draw of the game is its Season 2080 mode. This is more or less designed to mimic the Career Modes in other racers. There are some significant improvements over XG3. For starters, there are more options. You can choose a team and go with it. You're then assigned multiple objectives per race, and this adds a layer of depth and reason to each match. You might be called upon, for instance, to not only win a circuit but also destroy three Vixen signs along the way. The downside is that these secondary objectives oftentimes feel tacked onto the races just to make them more difficult or to give you something else to do. Sometimes they are downright pointless. For example, your primary goal will always be to win the race, but your secondary might be as rudimentary as having to qualify ahead of another racer.  In one case, we were challenged to beat an opponent who came in last place. Also disappointing is that while on the one hand we have a more realistic and simulation-like Season Mode in XGRA, you're sadly no longer able to acquire money and buy your bikes -- rather, they are awarded to you one-by-one as you advance through the various leagues. We're not sure why this freedom was removed, but it's missed. On a brighter note, a new Workshop option has been included in which you can immediately customize the down force, ride height and airbrake power of your bikes, and these individual alterations can have an impact on the way your craft handles in-game -- a welcomed plus.  We'd be liars, though, if we told you that we weren't under-whelmed by the lack of depth both in the Season 2080 Mode (especially in light of the grand ambitions by developer Acclaim Cheltenham) and by the selection of gameplay styles as a whole. If Season 2080 isn't your thing, you have Arcade and Time Trial to turn to, and that's pretty much it. We don't think either will hold your attention for very long.  XG3 owners, prepare to be shocked: XGRA plays nothing like the game you know. Bikes are heavier and they turn drastically with little pressure on the control stick. As a result, it's much easier to smack into the side-walls and bounce. We were and are big believers in the more subtle control scheme and feel that XG3 had to offer, so for us these changes are solid steps in the wrong direction. Why Acclaim Cheltenham felt it needed to redesign what were winning physics and control models is beyond us, but here we are. That said, anybody who liked the way the N64 Extreme G titles moved and played will probably find themselves enjoying the familiar country in XGRA. In fact, though we resisted at first out of pure stubbornness, the play mechanics eventually grew on us. You just have to remember that XG3 this game is not and then all seems to fall in place. Manipulation of the bikes is still intuitive for different reasons. The dense feel of the vehicles is somehow more realistic and the tight turns are definitely a plus (though we miss the leaning/airbrakes).   Meanwhile, the tweaked and enhanced weapon system is far superior to that in XG3, and effectively changes the dynamic. Aiming at enemies and surroundings is intuitive and the weapon selection process is greatly simplified and works far better than ever before. There's a real strategy to using weapons now and this heightens the intensity of the races. You have to know what each weapon does and why each might benefit you in specific racing situations and environments. A great degree of satisfaction is earned by, say, successfully using the Vampire to suck the energy away from an opponent and then propelling your racer ahead of him or her.  The track designs are every bit as wicked and outlandish as those in XG3, if not more so. Loops, twists, corkscrews, drop offs, ramps, sharp turns, multiple paths, and much more. You'll jet straight up impressive highways that seem to stretch directly into the sky, zoom around corners, go through tunnels, catch air off jumps -- you name it. Racing the bikes over arrows on the tracks provides instant speed boosts and these must be utilized smartly in order to win some races. The setup is well done, the selection for the most part satisfying. But there is one major drawback: the fluidity. This game does not enjoy the stunning 60 frames per second motion of its predecessor. The PS2 version runs at 30 frames with dips, with drops, yes, and sometimes it downright bogs down to the point where the action seems to stutter. This has a bearing on the gameplay experience -- it lessens the feeling that we are truly blazing down the circuits at mach-breaking speeds, and this is perhaps one of the title's biggest disappointments.       XGRA's Season Mode deals out quite a lot of tracks and track time, for that matter. There are five leagues, including Invitational (which is how your character begins his career), Subsonic, Sonic, Supersonic, and Ultrasonic. Subsonic and Sonic feature six circuits comprised of three courses each, while Ultrasonic features three courses comprised of four tracks each. Then there is Ultrasonic, which challenges you to one big league comprised of seven of the more difficult races. It'll take you a respectable amount of play time to beat them all -- a lot longer than the quickly-beaten XG3, by comparison. But don't expect a challenge of F-Zero GX-ian proportions. To top everything off, the game features a two-player multiplayer mode on PlayStation 2. There are some fluidity problems once more, but overall the addition is a bonus that should help extend replay value.  Graphics Generic interface aside, XGRA has a lot of style, even if some of it is borrowed. There seems to be this unspoken law that all futuristic racers must come equipped with neon-laced tracks and recognizable fonted signage, and Acclaim's racer adheres to the formula sometimes. You'll see those tracks. You'll see the transparent steel grated roadways, the branching streets, the multi-tiered roadways, and they all look enticing. But XGRA branches out some, too, a refreshing truth. It'll take you to outside terrain -- rocky landscapes and forest-ridden locales; it'll speed you across zero-gravity environments in outer-space -- you'll even see Saturn looming in the distance. You'll go up, down, and all around, inside tunnels, outside coaster-like railways, and more. Each track can be raced with different weather conditions, from rain to snow and even wind storms, all with adequate effects. There are some very nice graphic touches, too. For instance, in one race, as you go straight up a street, you'll see a blimp floating overhead you before the road bends again and you once again speed along flatland. More impressive still is the effect used to illustrate the process of breaking the sound barrier. The world momentarily just blurs out of focus and then back in -- it looks fabulous. Meanwhile, the particle effects in the game are well implemented and add quite a lot of color to the experience. There also seems to be much more geometry infiltrating the backgrounds, much of it interactive. The drawbacks of all this fall on the technology side more than they do the artistic one: first, the texture work seems muddied compared to many of today's current-generation games. It's definitely noticeable. And second, the framerate, which we already detailed, definitely suffers.   Sound Good and bad here. Let's get the bad out of the way. XGRA features the option to listen to rock or dance music, or even a mix of both. Don't go the rock route. Whatever you do, don't do that. It's not that the rock music in the game is poor -- it's mediocre, yes, but not exceptionally sub-par; but that noted it just doesn't fit with the game; it just doesn't work. The selection of dance music, on the other hand, is brilliant. Techno fans will recognize many of the bouncing, licensed tracks that propel the races along and the quality is pristine. A wide range of realistic sound effects round out the experience. Some may find the in-race dialogue between racers goofy, (~Hey, who rattled your cage?~ a ride shouts as he zooms by you, for example) but we've no problem with it. The quality is right on par. Meanwhile, engine noises, deep and realistic, sound great, while the weapon noises fit the situation perfectly. XGRA is a fun racer, but if you're expecting something that plays like XG3 -- don't. These are two different games. Acclaim's latest offering has a lot going for it still. Tight, if heavy control, a seriously improved weapon system that makes for a lot of fun, and the insane tracks that XG fans have come to expect from the franchise. This is a bigger game -- more courses and a slightly expanded Season Mode, too. No doubt, die-hard racing fans will find a good amount to be happy over here, especially at XGRA's reduced price tag. But there are some drawbacks, too, particularly if you -- like me -- know and love XG3 before it. Acclaim for some reason modified the control and physics systems for this sequel -- not bad, but in my opinion for the worse. Meanwhile, some of the additions are nearly useless; there are secondary objectives in races, yes, but most of them barely qualify as a challenge and seem to be added as an afterthought. Finally, what happened to the stunning 60-frames-per-second-fludity of XG3? XGRA runs at half that with constant dips in motion -- a disappointment that has a real bearing on the game as it lessens the sensation of speed, the primary element of any racer. All said and done XGRA is still a worthy racer. But it's far from a perfect one. A few more months of development time might have gone a long way toward ironing out some of the iffy design choices and technical shortcomings.Give it a rental at the very least.", "date": "Sep 22, 2003"}
