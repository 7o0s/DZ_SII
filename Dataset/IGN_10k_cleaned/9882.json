Going all the way back to Famicom Wars in 1988, the Wars series is one of the longest-running franchises in gaming.  Not surprising, then, that it was time to change things up a bit.  Advance Wars: Days of Ruin packs the same gameplay you know and love, but you may not recognize it at first glance.  The subtitle is appropriate -- this is a much darker game.  Once they get over their initial shock, though, fans are likely to fall in love all over again.   If you've been draft-dodging the Advance Wars series all this time, allow me to debrief you (no, I'm not going to take off your pants).  Turn-based strategy is the name of the AW game.  Players are given command of an army of cute little soldiers and take turns sending them into battle (where many meet their cute little demise).  There are ground, air, and naval units, and the real strength of the AW series is that all of these units are extremely well-balanced.   True to its name, our story begins as protagonist Will digs his way out of a disaster and finds the world in ruins.  Instead of the happy-go-lucky anime characters of yesterwars, this is a world of savage road warriors terrorizing the wasteland, cowards self-appointed as leaders, and parasitic plants that grow in and on human hosts.  Luckily, Will is soon rescued by Captain Brenner and his merry men and the group sets off in search of more survivors.   The drastic mood change Advance Wars has gone through should pay off for Nintendo.  Even if you really liked the artistic design and youthful exuberance of previous entries, the gameplay is still as solid as ever.  It is compared to rock-paper-scissors because Unit A is strong against Unit B, which is strong against Unit C, which is strong against Unit A.  While Days of Ruin starts out on the easy side, later missions will provide quite a challenge.  Mercifully, helpful tactical advice specific to your current battle is available from the Mission Info menu.   A classic game gets a fresh coat of paint.   Nintendo's other ace in the hole is that anyone who was turned off by the series' prior look and feel now have reason to give it another shot.   Previous sequels to Advance Wars kept adding more and more units to our army.  Days of Ruin removes some of the vehicles from Dual Strike and adds a couple new ones, resulting in the same count of 26 ground, air, and naval units.  The Neo- and Megatanks have been retired and replaced with the War Tank.  An Anti-tank has been introduced, which is an indirect unit that can counter-attack (finally, right?).  Two new versatile aircraft are now available: the Duster can fire on both ground and air units, and the Seaplane can attack any unit type.   Some vehicles can now be used to build units and structures.  The Rig replaces the APC transport vehicle, and can build temporary air- and seaports.  Aircraft carriers can now build Seaplanes.     Players will encounter several new types of terrain as they make their way across the scorched earth.  Titular ~ruins~ are decrepit buildings that provide excellent cover when fog of war is present.  ~Wastelands~ are areas of shattered earth that inhibit the movement of all ground units except infantry and mech soldiers.  Parts of the world are now eternally aflame.  These towers of fire cannot be passed through, but they will light a five-square area amidst fog of war.     It's disappointing to see that Days of Ruin does away with the Shop where you could spend points earned during gameplay to unlock new maps and characters.  This feature significantly expanded the single-player length of earlier games.  Instead, Days of Ruin has a free battle mode with 28 maps that are available as soon as you insert the cartridge.  Free battle can be played either alone against the computer or with another human being. There are extraneous training exercises that pop up along the campaign and extend the single-player mode.  These tend to be more difficult than the campaign missions and really help hone your strategic skills.   Of course, the ability to play multiplayer either locally or over wi-fi adds a great deal of replay value.  Voice chat is available through the DS' built-in microphone.  A robust Design Room allows you to create, trade, and store up to 50 user-created maps.  You can even set AI behavior for enemy troops.   Another aspect of Advanced Wars that has sadly been removed is the ability to select different Commanding Officers (CO) and use their special powers.  You can still choose your CO for multiplayer battles, and each provides a unique stat boost.  Of course, for every feature that has been removed for Days of Ruin, Nintendo seems to have added something new.  Units can now be leveled-up as they destroy enemy combatants.  Three levels can be achieved, and each tier provides offensive and defensive upgrades.  While Advance Wars: Days of Ruin has a shiny new coat of paint, the gameplay will be familiar territory to fans.  The changes are thus mostly cosmetic -- this is really the same turn-based strategy game we've been playing all along.  For the most part, that's a good thing.  Fans of the series are getting the game they know and love.  Just don't expect it to break new ground in terms of gameplay.  Nintendo has removed some previous features and added a few new ones, but when it's all added up I miss the old more than I like the new.  Days of Ruin still delivers the fun, though, and strategy fans will once again have their hands full.", "date": "Jan 21, 2008"}
