It's outdated, it's ugly, it is short on features and is easily outclassed by such genre rivals as MS Word or even its fellow Windows utility Wordpad.  There are only four menu options along the title bar--~File~, ~Edit~, ~Search~, and ~Help~--and none of them can be customized or changed the way can in MS Word.  The developers really skimped on the multimedia flash, too. There's nary a bell or whistle in the whole thing. In fact, even the graphics are pitiful, as Notepad is primarily a text interface surrounded by some truly drab grey and blue icons that never really convey a sense of story or place.  On the plus side, the system requirements are ridiculously low--Notepad only takes up a mere 51 kilobytes of hard drive space--and running multiple instances of the program will hardly take up any RAM space at all. However these minor positive points don't offset the many negatives.  Fans of the genre might considering pick this one up, but when it's all said and done, you'd probably be better off looking elsewhere.  -- JB", "date": "Apr 2, 1999"}
