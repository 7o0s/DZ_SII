As we have all seen by now, Smuggler's Run boasted some of the PlayStation 2' biggest environments, in which players could literally drive to any point they could see on screen. One year ago it was a great feat. Now it's pretty much standard. Big levels are everywhere, from Twisted Metal: Black to Soul Reaver 2 to Starfighter to Rockstar's volatile sequel, Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory, the sequel.    While the first Smuggler's Run never felt like a rushed game, it instead felt like the core of something bigger, something not fully shaped. Hostile Territory fleshed out the concept Rockstar and Angel Studios had in mind in the beginning, and turns up the heat with more relentless AI, better looking levels, and a wider variety of vehicles. Hostile Territory is a big, relatively deep game that still packs the same kind of off-road mania as the first game and it's improved.   But after playing 10-plus hours of it, I realize that while driving around like a complete lunatic, stealing and delivering goods in wild exotic places and watching kitschy FMV is all good fun, there is a certain mindlessness to it that doesn't engage me as entirely as much as Rockstar's opus, Grand Theft Auto III. Naturally, they are two different games, but the point is that Smuggler's Run 2 is a smash-'em-up game that's fun if you want a visceral, kinetic, bang-your-head way. If you're feeling in an exploratory, intelligent or experimental way, it's not such a good ride.   Gameplay Smuggler's Run 2 takes delivers the same kind of hybrid action/racing experience that its predecessor offered, only with more of everything. Players are given a large set of wide-open spaces to drive around in, with missions to guide them. What's changed is that now, the vehicles are more dramatically varied, players can deploy counter-measures to fend off their relentless pursuers, and a little more strategy is required to beat the levels.   Using FMV to invite players into a world of international, black market smuggling, Angel Studios has strangely but successfully created a kitschy ode to the 32-bit era by using actors and the likenesses of Vietnam and the south of Russia (a level that was originally Afghanistan, before the World Trade Center tragedy) to depict a small, money-driven organization of military hacks and opportunists who smuggle anything for the right price. The story isn't really much to speak about, because essentially you're just pulling off missions, but it's fun to see old-style FMV consciously used to tell the story.   Like the first Smuggler's Run, Hostile Territory offers several modes of play, ~Smuggler's Missions~ being the core story-driven mode, and the other modes splitting the game's assets into mini-games of their own. In Smuggler's Mission players play though a linear set of missions that follow a simple storyline (36 in all). Instead of bunching in every kind of gameplay idea into Smugglers Missions, Angel split the games out more evenly creating an incentive to play the other sections of the game. So now, if you just want to drive in Checkpoint Races, you can go to that mode and do it.   For one- or two-player games, Turf Wars includes three mini-games, including Crooks and Smugglers (meet your loot quota first), Loot Grab (deliver as much loot as possible), and Bomb Tag (get rid of the bomb before it explodes). Checkpoint Races also is one- to two-player, and features three driving landscapes (Russia, Vietnam, and Russian Border) with five races each, making 15 races total. And then there is Joyriding, a non-timed, free ride around the landscape.   During the levels, players should notice some differences and improvements in the gameplay over the first game. While the landscapes aren't actually any larger than the first game (they already were big enough), they are far more packed with visual details, objects, and fast-moving cars. I'll get into more detail about the graphics section soon, but it must be pointed out that the levels are much better looking than before. And the level of detail is far better than before. So, with more, and better-looking, textures, more objects, and a general framerate of 60 fps, Angel is not only showing its programming expertise but it's giving gamers a better overall game.   But, as Perry Farrell will tell you, nothing is shocking. The gameplay itself is very similar to the original. If you played the first game, you'll instantly feel comfortable playing this one. Nothing dramatic is happening here, but several enhancements to existing gameplay and a good dose of fine-tuning have reshaped the game a bit. In Smuggler's Missions, players find that the three environments (Russia, Vietnam, and Russian Border) feature more strategically placed bridges, low-lying valleys, rice fields, annoyingly placed houses or shacks, and other trees than before.   As with most games, by learning the environments, players will perform better in the later levels, and Hostile Territory is no different. Learning where bridges and tunnels reside, and knowing the intricacies of your vehicle is vital. And, as I've pointed out in my preview, the environments are more interactive, oftentimes conspiring against you. Pedestrian vehicles get in the way, rockslides damage vehicles, and hidden landmines will launch drivers hundreds of feet into the air, completely destroying the vehicle, and the mission run. It's also worth pointing out that the learning curve is initially quite low, and then jumps dramatically around level 9, gradually rising higher through each level.   The newly added mission objectives add another wrinkle into the Smuggler's Run concept, but the moving airships, and changing objectives is really a facelift more than anything. It doesn't change the way the game is played much. There is more variety, yes, but it doesn't seem like in the Smuggler's Missions that the variety was as wide and as engaging as I had hoped. The game is still very much a linear, objective-based one. There isn't too much to explore, there are no major hidden items, and it's basically a pure chase and romp title from beginning to end. Yes, it's good fun, but it's more of the same kind of entertainment, with no new real breakthroughs.   The eight vehicles have changed for the better. Rather than offer a bunch of relatively similar cars, the variety has widened to include some interesting off-road monsters. Players who loved the speedy cars of SR1, will be happy with the insanely fast rally car (Special Du Monde) and the nimble ATV Monster. If they liked the regularity of the Super Buggy, pick-up (Baja Truck), or the jeep (D-5 Hondo), they will have it here. Or if they prefer the steady tenaciousness of the Grenadier or the Sahara Special, it's here.   What makes each of these vehicles more interesting than their predecessors is that, not only are they better cars to drive (at least the ones that have returned), but they each have a specific counter-measure -- weapons -- to thwart their opponents. The best ones include D5 Hondo's oil slick, the ATV's brilliant, screen-blurring speed boost, the Baja Truck's bombs, and the Kavostov's smoke screens. Hey, why not include a little Spy Hunter tactics to enrich the fun? These prove integral to missions in which players must lose their opponents after they've completed all of the pick-ups and drops-offs.   The AI opponents do get annoying. It's their job, of course, but the level of aggressiveness only grows larger, and in the later levels, it seems that sometimes one must simply play through them several times, regardless of their skill level. You must rely on all of your skill and a hefty amount of pure luck to beat some levels. Naturally, this is where my biggest complaint comes down. While I don't always feel like playing this kind of game (the testosterone-filled, bang-your-head kind), when I do feel like playing it, the AI is notably quirky and weird. In at least one third of the missions, I had to play through several times and I got downright pissed off, while in another third, I zipped through the first time. It's like the AI was either totally relentless or just happily trailing along to look like it was doing something.   Also, I would really have liked it if the vehicles moved better at slow speeds. They move extremely well in full speeds, but while reversing or in trying to accurately hit something was harder than I expected, and trying to just make simple turns at slow speeds was difficult. It was with any vehicle, too.   One of the things I like most about Hostile Territory is the presentation and interface. The memory card load times are incredibly quick and managing through the game menu is easy and explanatory. The mission load times are shorter than before, and they're smart. They load in like a graphics file on a computer, with one layer of detail replacing one after another. It's all good.   Graphics Smugglers Run 2: Hostile Territory is one of those games that shows off its developer's programming capabilities. It's not quite art or Onimusha CG quality, but it's so much more packed with details than the first game that I was surprised. While the huge landscapes are still quite vacant and plain, the details that Angel worked in are quite noticeable. I'm specifically talking about the Vietnam levels. And I guess I'm a sucker for pretty little flowers, too, because that's making my graphic tart meter rise. But it's not just the pretty fields of wild flowers; it's the rice paddy fields, the heavily floral mountains and hills, and the complete lack of pop-up or fade-in.   Under the assumption that the FMV cutscenes were meant to be a subtle wink and a nod to the forgettable 32-bit days of interactive movies, Angel's quirky decision to use FMV to tell the story behind the Smuggler's Missions is cool one. And I don't mean cool as in big, neato, loud explosions cool, I mean cool as in wonderfully out-of-fashion and loving it cool. The FMV is kitschy and funnily apt. It still sucks, but it's meant to suck in a way. When you see the Hispanic smuggler with the cheesy, wide-load, pasted-on mustache, or the Asian messenger dude, you'll know what I mean.   The other aspects of the game that fill in the rest of the visuals are welcome. The constant landmine explosions, landslides, and huge explosions, are all well done. The snow and rain add a nice visual touch. The transitions between the game and the cutscenes is seamless, and the game overall is well polished, with nary a seam and no pop-up to be seen. And again, the interface itself is great.   My biggest complaint? Rather than adding a new layer of visual depth, the night levels are mostly just annoying. I mean, I guess they would have been even more annoying if they were pitch black and used realtime lighting (actually they would have been impossible), but it's not that what happened.   Sound It's funny that in my review of Smuggler's Run 1 that I suggested country or hard rock music to go with the scenery and gameplay. I hate country music. But perhaps I just felt it was out of synch.   Now, listening to Smuggler's Run 2, the trance, house and techno music somehow seems like it fits better. Perhaps it's because the tracks are better, and some actually have lyrics that pertain to the game, but maybe the whole package works better together, too. I feel that the interface, music, and the whole feel of the game have indeed gelled and become a working whole, instead of disparate parts slung together. I truly liked the music in Smuggler's Run 2 and would listen to the songs on my own. Kevin Saunderson, 430 West Records, and Blueprint's James Ruskin have crafted some fantastic music that's been carefully selected to work in SR2.   And lastly, thankfully, the annoying chick-announcer was fired and did not make a return appearance. Thank you, Angel and Rockstar for getting rid of her. In the end, Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory is a good, solid game. I like the changes and the additions, but I found that about mid-way through playing Smuggler's Run 2, I had had enough. (And yes, I continued to play it despite that wanting to quit feeling.) Despite the many improvements made across the board, from the improved graphics to the more enjoyable soundtrack, interface, and the wider variety of vehicles and the added countermeasures, I felt that the game didn't spark my inner enthusiast-crazy-gamer child like other games on PS2 have this year. Naturally, I'm a little spoiled. I have been playing a ton of great games this year, just on PS2 alone. Smuggler's Run 2, by all means, is a good game, but it's not a deep, involving story-based title. It's a fun, wild romp-style action-racing game that's better than last year's version, it's just the concept itself is a little shallow. And in the general action-racing genre, the only competitors are Smuggler's Run 1, Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open, and Spy Hunter. It fairs quite well among these other titles.", "date": "Nov 1, 2001"}
