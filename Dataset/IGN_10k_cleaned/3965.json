Easily one of the best launch titles for any console and still one of the best games available for the Xbox, it's a game that transcended the market. Though it hasn't quite enjoyed the same visibility in the public consciousness as titles like Grand Theft Auto or The Sims, Halo is, nevertheless, one of the industry's premiere titles. As we said in our Xbox review, it's the excuse to buy an Xbox and vice versa.   So there are a few ways to approach the review of Halo: Combat Evolved. One is as a fan of the Xbox version; another is as a player completely unaware that the game even existed. I'll try to straddle the fence as best I can in the review but, just so my bias is out in the open right away, I'll tell you that I'm a definite fan of the Xbox version of the game. To further bare my soul, I suppose I should also tell you that I've been excited about this game since it was first demoed to us four years ago (as a PC-only Tribes-killer, no less).   Gearbox's conversion (which is a nicer word than ~port~) preserves much of what I loved about the original game. The pacing, the weapons, the enemies and, in fact, the entire content of the game, is exactly as it was when we played it a couple of years ago. That, as you'll see later in the review, is both a blessing and a curse for the PC version of Halo: Combat Evolved.   Most video game science-fiction is of fairly low quality and, thankfully, Halo is the exception to the rule. Boasting a story that draws the player in to an alien world, Halo presents us with enough information and background to keep things interesting while still allowing for real surprises. The player steps into the shoes of an elite soldier just as his ship is attacked by an alien force known as the Covenant. The player is forced to crash land on an alien ring world and uncover the secret of its purpose. Suffice it to say that the whole style and presentation of the story is good enough to stand on its own -- a quality few game plots possess.   Along the way you'll meet a range of enemies who all exhibit very distinct behaviors. The basic grunt units of the Covenant are small, chicken-like aliens who rely on numbers to overwhelm the player. You can even intimidate these tiny guys by taking out the large enemies first. Left alone on the battlefield, these grunts will scurry off to gather their courage before attacking you again. The shield-carrying Jackals are next on the list and their forward-facing protection and tendency to roll from side-to-side while dodging your fire forces you to adopt entirely different tactics when facing them. The big Elite troopers (in a variety of colors, no less) begin to offer more of a challenge as they're protected by armor and capable of beating the crap out of you if you get too close. There are a few more enemies beyond these guys that have their own tactics and weaknesses.   Video Review Available! They say seeing is believing. Check out our six-minute video review!

Links :: Video Review |     Part of the fun of Halo is that you won't be able to carry more than two weapons at any one time. Not only does this seem much more reasonable (I love how my character in Jedi Academy can perform all manner of flips and acrobatics while weighted down with one of every weapon in the galaxy), it also forces the player to focus on tactics by fitting various weapons to varied circumstances.   One small problem with the weapons (and the enemies, too, I suppose) is that the game still seems balanced for console play. Now, before you get your flame pens ready, let me assure you that I think Halo works wonderfully on the Xbox. But regardless of platform allegiance, you have to admit that it's much easier to hit enemies using the mouse aiming system than it is when using the Xbox's right analog stick. But since weapon strength and enemy resistance seem identical on both versions, you'll need to raise the difficulty level on the PC version to get a sufficient challenge.   And you may need to lower the graphics settings on the PC version to get a sufficient framerate. While the Xbox version had the occasional stutter here and there, the PC version seems much less reliable. We've tested the game on a range of systems. The one I've used the most is a 2.4GHz machine with a GeForce 4. At that level, I was able to play with all the details up at 800x600 fairly smoothly. I can get comparable performance at slightly higher resolutions by dropping the texture detail and shadows. But with everything turned all the way up at 1600x1200, we still had noticeable (but not completely aggravating) choppiness on our dual 3GHz machines with the new GeForce and Radeon cards.   If you can run it at the higher end of the graphics, you're in for a real treat. The details apparent on the weapons, soldiers and even rocks and trees leaves little to be desired. Combine that with a fantastically natural suite of animations and you've got a game that draws you in and refuses to let go. Human grenades leave pockmarks on the ground after exploding in a puff of smoke and flame. Better still are the glowing Covenant plasma grenades which explode with an eerie blue light. There's something...I don't know, juicy about it all.   While we're on the subject, the weapon sounds are remarkably satisfying and the aspect of the Xbox version's design that translates most easily to the PC format. In the case of the grenades, the explosions are quite deep and the boom will rattle your windows as surely as it rattles your nerves. In fact, all the weapon sounds have a satisfying depth and distinction to them. Voice acting is quite good as well, particularly in the case of the ersatz alien voices used for the Covenant. Beyond that, the game has one of the best game themes around and definitely comparable to the Battlefield theme in terms of evoking a Pavlovian salivation here at the office. The rest of the score is just as good, fitting the pace and place of the game perfectly.   The art style of the game is also perfectly appropriate and not really like anything else I've ever seen. You get a real sense that you're in an alien world and that things have been designed without any human-based preconceptions. Oh, sure, the aliens still walk on legs (and even speak English strangely) but their overall design is great. The same is true of the levels in the game, both those of ship and base interiors and those of broad outdoor areas.     But though the levels are beautiful, there are two main problems with the shape of the levels in Halo. Of the two, the lack of any contextual cohesiveness is probably the more nit-picky. Nevertheless, the endless succession of hallways and rooms fails to fit in to a solid enough framework to give the player a real sense of place. In other words, nearly all of the rooms in Halo have no excuse for existing beyond offering a convenient place for you to fight a new batch of enemies.    Frequent repetition of spaces is the worse offender in terms of the game's level design. You'll find yourself traveling through long chains of rooms that all look exactly alike. This is particularly true for the final half of the game where it seems as if the entire environment is made up of three modular pieces: long halls, circular rooms or large bridges. There's only so much variety you can obtain from using these pieces again and again and, while it gives the player a chance to try different approaches to similar situations, it can easily become monotonous.   It can also make it damned difficult to tell one room from another during the rare cases where you get turned around or are forced to backtrack through other areas. Fortunately, Halo makes use of small lighted triangles placed on the floor that indicate which direction you should be heading. These are a bit of a contrived convenience but they definitely help keep you oriented through the game's more repetitive areas.   It's too bad that the repetition of areas tends to kill the pace of the game somewhat, particularly because, outside of that single frustration, Halo has probably a much better overall sense of rhythm than most shooters on the market. It starts big with the initial alien attacks on the Pillar of Autumn and it really doesn't ever let up. The few rare moments when you're not blasting away at throngs of enemy aliens, you'll be watching some fantastic cutscenes that help bring you back to the plot. Your marine's power suit also carries the personality of the ship's AI and she'll provide lots of advice and instructions to you within the game itself, thereby keeping the action wonderfully immediate.   There are also some really fantastic triggers in the game. During certain transitions, the screen will shrink to the more familiar letterbox format as events are played out before you within the game engine. Things like chapter titles and varying music cues help clue you in that something new is about to happen and provide you with a clear framework for the overall shape of the game. As with the physics, it's a slightly inexpressible quality that makes it all work so well. Let's just say that ten minutes of playing through it is worth a thousand words of explanation as to why it works.   I can, at least, offer one concrete example of how this design works. The game has automatically saves your progress at frequent checkpoints. Though you can have multiple save files now, you'll rarely (if ever) bother to save your game yourself. Now that I think about it, I finished the PC game without saving once, preferring to remain ~in the moment~ and let the game engine take care of backing up your progress. When (notice I didn't say ~if~) you die, the game automatically reloads the last checkpoint for you. I should also mention here that there are virtually no load times in the game at all. Transitioning between levels on the Xbox version could take up to half a minute in some cases. Here it's virtually instantaneous.   Though it's equally hard to quantify, I have to say that Halo has one of the best physics systems around. Though it's nearly impossible to express in words, the experience of playing Halo convinces you that you're in a world with consistent and intuitive natural laws. Everything has an appreciable mass and you'll get a real sense of the weight of objects as you interact with them. Toss a grenade in to a clump of enemies and you'll see them blown through the air by the blast. As they twist and tumble and eventually slam in to the ground you'll have no doubt that these guys actually weigh something in the environment.     This impression of mass is also strong with the game's vehicles, particularly the Warthog. This wheeled jeep has offered us countless hours of driving fun. It ranks right up there with the jeep from Battlefield in terms of believable behavior. Hit a small slope and the jeep will lift off the ground and settle back down quite naturally. The effect of the suspension goes a long way to making things look more realistic, but the sense of weight applies even to the game's flying vehicles.    While many Xboxers enjoyed playing through the game cooperatively with a friend, no such feature is offered on the PC version. I tend to be a bit more forgiving of this omission than some of the other editors around here, but it's still unfortunate that PC players won't have the same chance to take on the entire game alongside a buddy. Gearbox's explanation that the code required to include this feature would involve a substantial overhaul seems a sufficient enough reason to go ahead and release the title without it.   But as a consolation, they have added six new maps and a couple of new weapons and modes. The more directed Assault mode (which alternates in placing two teams on defense and offense in a CTF format) is a nice addition, but those players who want more can use the game's custom multiplayer mode to create their own versions of the game, including game type, vehicle mix and a few other options. The team has also allowed gamers to pilot the flying Covenant Banshee in multiplayer. Those of you who've managed to snag this baby during the single player game will relish the thought of swooping down on your enemies from above and laying them out with the craft's formidable weaponry.   The six new maps offer a range of interesting spaces in which to play. I quite like the level based on the beach assault during the single player game's Silent Cartographer level. Conversely, the large bridge level offers something that we haven't really seen before but it still quite compelling. Given the game's 16-player limit, we won't find fault with the relative intimacy of some of the levels. But even on the smaller levels, there are interesting and hidden routes you can take to seemingly inaccessible areas.     The networking code seems stable enough but the single player game's occasionally choppy performance occurs here as well, particularly when you've got a full roster of players all tossing grenades about. Since the game's not due out till next week, we've had to content ourselves with LAN games here at the office and the occasional online match against industry-insider types who already have their gold versions. Once more players start flooding the servers, Gearbox will have an opportunity to address some of the network performance issues. Hopefully, they'll be able to do the same to the game's overall graphics performance.  I loved this game on the Xbox and it's one of the titles I'll still bust out from time to time, particularly for its split-screen multiplayer appeal. But when evaluated against the standards of the current PC shooter catalog, Halo seems to fall short in just a few key areas: repetitive levels, steep performance requirements and a lingering console balance.Given the fact that so little has changed in the game's transition to the PC, I certainly won't recommend it to the considerably large group of players who are already satisfied with the Xbox version. Sure, you get a few new things in the area of multiplayer but the rest of the game is exactly as it was two years ago. If you've played the game on the Xbox, there's not much for you here. But if you're in the 2 to 3GHz range and have a good 3D accelerator, then the PC version will definitely reward your investment, both in time and in the money you spent to get a powerful computer.", "date": "Sep 28, 2003"}
