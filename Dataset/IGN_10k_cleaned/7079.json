Right? Wrong. Like Colin McRae Rally and Rallisport Challenge before it, TopWare's Xpand Rally proves that automotive competition doesn't necessarily need a whole gaggle of cars to be both exciting and ridiculously compelling. Granted, you'll need to get comfortable with the off-road, beat-the-clock rallying school of racing to fully appreciate the game. But if you're a serious fan of the art of driving, chances are Xpand Rally's strong mix of sophisticated physics, hyper-realistic graphics, and torturous courses will get you as comfy as you ever need to be.   Unlike many of today's top-level racing simulations, Xpand Rally is not licensed up the ying-yang. It does not feature a who's-who lineup of real life sponsors or real life drivers. Its tracks are not digital representations of real life circuits. And its cars hail from imaginary manufacturers such as ~Tiny,~ ~Monsoon,~ and ~Center~ rather than Mini, Mitsubishi and Ford. Does it matter? Perhaps to some, but not so much once you get out there and drive.   Off the top, the game asks you to create a profile for yourself. You can then configure your control device, select your options, choose ~Arcade~ or ~Simulation~ physics modeling, and commence racing. Happily, Xpand Rally doesn't limit you to a single profile -- you can create and open new profiles at any time, essentially allowing you to become any one of your alter egos whenever you choose.     Rallying rookies may want to head for Arcade mode to start, where they can bang off boulders and ride up the sides of steep slopes without worrying too much about the negative repercussions of real world physics. Newcomers should note, however, that the game is never truly easy. The roads are both snake-like and snaky, the racing surfaces vary from tarmac to dust to gravel (often within the same stage), and sudden elevation changes and roadside obstacles are commonplace.   ~Single Race~ is a great way to get acclimatized to developer Techland's excellent car and physics model and the game's five distinct worldwide regions and 70-plus track variations. Yet ~Rally Championship~ mode is undoubtedly where true Rally aficionados must go. This is where tracks are unlocked and all eight classes and thirty-plus variants of automobiles are accessed. This is where you win money, which you'll take to the parts store to buy and install one the countless available upgrades you'll need to deal with the increasingly difficult circuits and the increasingly challenging lap times that lay ahead.   But while upgraded brakes and engines and transmissions and so much more are undoubtedly necessary if you want to advance past even the first few races, Xpand Rally is unique in that its upgrade shop isn't the entire answer to faster times. Most racing games that feature upgradeable parts allow drivers to buy just enough to propel them to victory in the next event and so on, but that's not the case here. In this game, you'll need to combine your new flywheels and stabilizer bars with garage aptitude. In other words, money won't buy your way to the top unless you also know how to adjust and tweak those parts to your advantage.   Fortunately, the Xpand Rally garage is not so complex that it's absurdly difficult. It uses plain English rather than exacting numerical values for each of its adjustable components (tires, suspension height, suspension stiffness, brake strength, brake balance, steering, gear ratios, and power transfer). But you'll need to learn why your car does what it does, why you can't take certain turns as efficiently as your competition, and why you can't accelerate as quickly or brake as sharply.   Tire selection, for example, makes a tremendous difference, no matter what track you take on. Even seemingly insignificant adjustments such as brake bias (50/50 feels very different than, say, 65/35) or steering responsiveness (seven levels, from very slow to very fast) can make or break a run. As the online manual doesn't offer any magic solutions, there's just one way to learn -- by driving the thing, making an alteration or two, and getting back on the track again.    There's just one problem: For some inexplicable reason, the game doesn't allow you to save your garage settings. Therefore, if you've developed a perfect setup for a given track, you'll need to write it down somewhere or remember it before you change your settings for the next circuit.   Interestingly, choosing a manual gearbox over an automatic does not enhance your car's performance. This flies in the face of the philosophy of most racing sims, wherein the selection of a manual transmission most often guarantees better acceleration, better car control, and improved stopping. But Xpand Rally's fully automatic gearbox isn't recommended either. Instead, the game's semi-automatic gearbox is the way to go. With it, you can allow your generally intelligent transmission to shift for you most of the time, thus freeing you up for the daunting task of steering, accelerating and braking through these oh-so-difficult courses. However, you can also override it when you need to -- say, if you've made a mistake in a turn and need more torque and a lower gear than the automatic tranny offers.   Driving an Xpand Rally sedan is a joy. The physics modeling is strong, and the reactions to both the driver's input and the usually bumpy environments are believable. Drifting through turns is a pure blast. Techland has designed a driving experience that's tough and very much rewarding, but isn't so sadistically demanding that players will run away in tears.     Multiplayer rallying is intriguing in that it offers drivers a chance to compete with real people rather than software-controlled drones (albeit good software-controlled drones). It also allows you to decide whether you'd like to race alongside ghost images or actual hittable cars. Sadly, the game does not have a matchmaker service. Nor are there a lot of people currently playing at its dedicated server. Therefore, the most difficult part of playing online may not be winning the races but merely sourcing willing combatants.         Conversely, one of the game's most likeable elements is its attention to what lies off the racing surface. Unlike many of its peers, Xpand Rally doesn't feature magical trackside boundaries that immediately bounce you back onto the road whenever you veer off it. Indeed, the game not only permits the occasional off-road jaunt, but encourages it. Needless to say, racing through low-lying foliage is a common occurrence.   And although the game is a solo affair, you'll rarely feel lonely out there. Along for the ride is your co-driver, a talkative and righteously intelligent fellow who not only knows when and where you should turn left or right -- even if the upcoming turn is obscured by vegetation -- but will also convey the severity of that corner and whether there's an obstacle of some description perched trackside that will prevent you from cutting inside. Moreover, he'll warn you of upcoming hazards such as nasty bumps or ruts, and of course those mortifying hundred-foot cliffs you'll encounter in the Grand Canyon course.   Also keeping you company is the ghost image of the car that set the fastest time on that circuit. If you manage to keep ahead of him to the finish line, you can rest assured you've won the stage. If you can keep within close proximity, you know you're within striking distance of second place, a position you'll usually need to attain in order to advance to the next stages. But even if you do fall behind by what seems like a considerable distance, don't give up. The computer drivers may well have made errors along the way and scrubbed off some time too. This is just one more reason to like Xpand Rally -- the AI competitors don't drive like unerring Robotrons.          Xpand Rally is a smooth operator too -- as it should be, considering it's been available in Europe in essentially the same form for at least a year. We encountered no graphical difficulties while testing on a PC that only barely exceeded the game's system requirements. Nor did we have problems Alt-Tabbing between it and other applications. Movement between certain menu interfaces seems a bit ponderous at times, but navigation is generally quick and the interfaces are sensibly designed, so you don't need to toggle through a horde of screens and menus to get to the one you want. Players may restart a stage at any time during an event, and they can roll back their career to an earlier point when they've screwed up so badly that there's no other way out.         One of the game's most interesting perks is its replay suite. With no fewer than ten camera perspectives at your disposal, including a spiffy ~orbiting~ cam that rotates slowly around your car, you'll never lack for a perfect view of your latest amazing maneuver or most hideous crash. But Xpand Rally goes further than that by offering a bevy of truly cool camera effects, too. If you want to watch your highlights as if they're being shown on a black and white TV, you can do that. If you want them to run like they're part of an old time movie, complete with all its authentically yellowed sepia tones, you can do that too. Adding motion blur or landscape blur or super-saturating all the colors is as easy as pointing and clicking.         If you're serious about circuit design, Xpand Rally's included editor helps you go beyond the game's pre-designed basics. With it, you can modify existing tracks, conceptualize and design brand new tracks, and essentially do most everything Techland did when it developed the game. A word to the wise, though -- this is no stripped-down, dumbed-down utility. Xpand Rally's terrain and scenery is courtesy of Techland's proven ~Chrome~ engine technology, and the ~ChromeEd~ editor is sophisticated stuff. It's safe to say that most players will need to download and study ChromeEd's 106-page online manual just to get a grasp for what can be accomplished.   No matter what you design, chances are it will look good even if it doesn't drive perfectly. Truth be told, many of the game's tracks share common scenery elements. But each circuit is so crammed full of scenery and graphical goodies that you'll likely never tire of looking out your windshield.     Certainly drivers will enjoy ~interacting~ with their surroundings, nearly all of which sports at least semi-realistic physical properties. Tall grass blows gently in the breeze, flattens underneath your tires, and resumes its gentle wave after you've disappeared down the track. If you hit a lamppost, you'll incur a dent in the front of your car. If you nudge up against one of the many portable barriers, you'll push it along the road in front of you. If you ram that very same barrier at any sort of appreciable speed, you'll toss it high into the air, end over end.    But whatever you do, don't target the lunatic fans that stand alongside the track or the crazed spectators that jump out on the course directly in front of you for a better view. If you hit a human, your penalty is severe.   Overhead, clouds glide through the sky and project their shadows across the ground. Water puddles ripple and splash when you drive through them. Rain droplets accumulate and streak across your windshield, and wipers effectively clean up the mess. Your manually-controlled headlights blaze a trail through the night, and your multiple antennas bend when you accelerate.   Damage modeling is stunning but ultimately a bit too forgiving. Windshields crack and implode, paint layers chip off, doors bounce open, engines belch thick black smoke, and virtually the entire body can deform into something far less attractive. What's more, collisions affect not just the appearance but also the capabilities and feel of your car, and truly bad drivers will see their rides reduced to twisted, immobile hulks. But to incur that level of damage, or to injure your driver and negatively impact his health (an admittedly unique wrinkle), you really need to search out carnage by smashing deliberately into anything you see and perhaps hurtling purposely off a few cliffs.   Xpand Rally's audio is satisfactory but unremarkable. Vehicle engines accurately convey the current level of acceleration, but they sound somewhat less than authentic. Tire scrub is decent and helpful, but gearshifts are strangely silent. Co-drivers bark out their instructions in fine form, but there are no track announcers or broadcast crew.Xpand Rally is just the kick-start the North American PC rally racing scene needed. Although its budget pricing suggests otherwise, the game is impressively appointed and wonderfully rendered. The physics modeling is superb, and the damage modeling is nothing short of stunning. Drivers accustomed to huge packs of cars will need to adjust to what is essentially a solo exercise, but there's more than enough here to keep serious racers happily motoring for quite some time.", "date": "Jul 24, 2006"}
