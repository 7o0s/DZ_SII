{"name": "Extreme Boards & Blades", "name_review": "Extreme Boards & Blades", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/10/extreme-boards-blades", "text": "I remember when I got my first skateboard.  I was eleven years old and I thought I was invincible.  The first day I went out with the 'big boys' and tried my hand at the half pipe they had set up in their back yard.  Man did I ever look the fool.  My first experience on a skateboard ended up with me going to the hospital with a broken arm.  Well, after playing Extreme Boards & Blades, I realize my fate could have been worse.  I've made it my personal mission to review every Head Games ~Extreme~ title in an attempt to find at least one that I enjoy playing.  So far it hasn't happened.  Especially not with Extreme Boards & Blades.  This game is by far one of the worst of the bunch.  Maybe it's because I used to skate as a kid and I have a fondness for it in my heart; maybe it's because I really wanted to like this one because I've played soooo many of the ~Extreme~ titles that I figured they had to get it right at least once; maybe it's because the game is a load of rubbish.  Yeah, that last one.  That's the one.  I just don't understand how Head Games gets big names like Mountain Dew and PowerBar to attach their names to something like this.  It would be like Nike releasing a new Air Jordan filled with dog poo.  The control interface is absolutely wretched, the game is extremely choppy and it just fails miserably at trying to capture the feeling of moving at high speeds and performing sick tricks on a skateboard or rollerblades.    You may notice on the sidebar that this game is 3D accelerated.  Well, at least the 3dfx logo pops up when you start the game.  I really don't see how this game uses 3D acceleration, because it looks like the poor little red-headed stepchild that climbed the ugly tree and fell, hitting every branch on the way down.  In typical Head Games fare, the graphics look like something from the early days of computing, just a notch above Pong.  The back of the CD jewel case claims that the game includes realistic player motion and graphics.  Well, they might be realistic movement and graphics if you're a blocky member of the Jagged family who fell on a broomstick as a young child and couldn't afford a doctor to get the darn thing out of your rear.  I just don't understand how games like this get out of the quality assurance stage.   The game itself offers fifteen different arenas to test out your skating skills, with six available from the start and nine that have to be unlocked by getting high scores in the competition mode.  Of course, after you load up the first arena your spirit will be broken and you won't want to unlock any more of the locales.  Not like there is that much variance anyway.     If I had to sum up Extreme Boards and Blades in one paragraph, I think it would go something like this:  Crap crap crap crap, crap crap crap crap crap.  Crap, crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap: crap crap crap crap crap.  Crap crap crap crap, crap, crap crap crap crap.  CRAP!  Crap crap crap; crap crap crap.  Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap, crap crap crap crap crap.  Crap crap crap?  Crap, crap crap crap crap crap.   This game would be more aptly titled Extremely Bored, Now Kill Me.  -- Extreme Tal  Oh yeah, if you want to see some real extreme skateboarding, make with the clicking here.
