Survival Kids is like a role-playing game in many ways  it adds a few refreshing, new twists, and its innovative style illustrates itself in a very  non-traditional way.  Unlike the Final Fantasys of the portable world, there are neither experience nor  gold, but instead a uniqueness which is slightly akin to Harvest Moon -- and it works extremely well. Features Hours of survival quests Battery Back-up For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Poor you, trapped all alone on an isolated island with nothing but a broken radio and a knife. Your family, which was with you on a cruise ship before it was sunk in last night's storm, is absolutely nowhere to be seen.  What ever are you to do?  As either a 10-year-old boy or girl, you have little choice but to suck in your gut, pull out your knife, and get  to work, because if you don't take care of yourself in this new jungle wilderness, no one will. So begins your journey to find the way home.  The surroundings will play a humongous role of the game, no matter where  your character happens to be. From rocks to sticks, and vines to leaves, you can collect just about everything you can see. Everything? Yes, everything  has a use of some sort.  Even the most pointless piece of tree bark can be combined with some other common item to make something helpful.  The combinations, however, are yours for the finding, and there are dozens to discover.  Some take a bit of playing around before they are revealed, but are worth the frustration and pay off well.  Picking up sticks and rocks is necessary for creating tools such as fire kindling, but your main focus should be on simply getting by one day at a time.  Eating, drinking, and resting are all daily activities that require your attention, and are not difficult to tend.  Food around the island is plentiful, whether it be a berry, mushroom, fern, or heap of meat, and water is never scarce, either.  Sleeping can be a bother, though, because your character grows tired rather quickly and needs to find a place to rest.  The hut, which is found early in the adventure, is your prime source for revitalization, as well as a great place to store unnecessary junk.   Scattered along the way are hollowed-out trees which provide shelter when the hut is nowhere to be found. Running out of water is rarely a bother, since there is almost always a plentiful supply nearby. Your canteen, which should always be in your pack, can also hold several servings of aqua for those dire situations when no streams appear to be around.   Unlike menu-based battles used in regular RPGs, Survival Kids' quarrels are duked out in real time, much like the Legend of Zelda.  However, fighting is most usually pointless, and may result in your death if the animal is strong enough.  Your only weapon at the beginning is a knife, and you stand little chance if you encounter, for example, a wolf.  In most cases, battles should be avoided altogether, because you need to conserve your strength at all costs.  How does one replenish his or her life points?  Eating is the most efficient way of regaining lost health.  Ferns and meat are especially useful, and can be found by  wandering, attacking animals, catching fish, and so on.  Similarly, health can be detracted through attacks or eating the wrong edibles, such as poisonous mushrooms or rotten meat.  Always check whether or not your food has negative effects before putting it in your mouth.  The elements also play a role in your exploration, and can hinder you in  several ways.  Although things are normally sunny and bright, rain can fall, and day can turn to night.  When it rains, lighting fires outdoors becomes impossible, and some areas may be closed due to flooding.  The darkness at night, of course, limits your vision.  Instead of being able to  see what is on the entire screen, you have a small ring of light.  This can be removed by using  the right items, but makes things difficult otherwise.  The appearance, both graphically and musically, is charming.  Regions are detailed with trees, bushes, grass, sand, and all kinds of collectible objects.  Although it  looks good no matter what, this game looks best on Game Boy Color, no questions asked.  The tunes sound just as good as the game looks, and apply themselves to the scene well.     With the right things, a little patience, and severe wanderlust, Survival Kids shrinks from being atask to becoming downright fun.  Although there is little story to back up the involving gameplay, andvery few characters with which to interact, Survival Kids shows that a little creativity goes along way.  This addictive game grows on you after a few goes-around, and will keep you returninguntil you find a way back home.  Konami has produced an enchanting game which is veryenjoyable to play, and proves that there still are unmade styles of play just begging to becreated.", "date": "Dec 21, 1999"}
