I thought to myself, ~Why would anyone make a game about stacking cheese?~ I then started the game only to realize it was really called Stacked Cheerleaders. I then thought to myself, ~Why would anyone make a game about stacking cheese unless it offered nutritional value and cheese recipes?~   Stacked Cheerleaders is an engrossing, in depth hand-eye coordinating orgy of demanding puzzles where you travel to various exotic locales searching for clues that will lead you to the whereabouts of exotic treasures. Oh, I'm sorry. I have this game confused with something that would actually be interesting to play. This is merely a game where you stack cheerleaders. Boy, do I feel silly!   Stacking cheerleaders should be fun until you realize you are only stacking them one on top of another. There is no movement to the cheerleaders and each one has the same pose of their legs and arms apart. A helicopter lowers the cheerleaders above your stack and you press the center or 5 button to drop the cheerleader on the stack. Time it right and drop her perfectly on top of the cheerleader below her and you start the combo meter that multiplies your points. Off center just a bit and the meter goes back to zero. It's very boring because after playing for about ten minutes there just isn't enough to keep you interested.   I would liked to have seen a game where you can stack different formations of your cheerleaders but the only formation here is a vertical one. The cheerleaders have no physics or animations to them and they look like plastic monkeys with wigs and pom poms. How fun would it be to be able to stack your cheerleaders in the craziest formations you can think of and watch as they sway back and forth trying to keep their balance? Or stack them in different spots besides a stadium, like on a boat or during a wind storm? How fun would it be if you played this game in a biker bar, giggling as loud as you can while taunting everyone to see if they can beat your high score?   In Stadium Mode do your best to stack cheerleaders and see how many spirit points you can achieve. The more spirit points you earn, the more people begin to fill in the stadium. You can choose between four teams with the only difference being how many cheerleaders you need to stack and the color of their outfits. Each team also has their own Mascot you place on top of your stack, and if you make a nice enough stack you can place a special Mascot on top if it's available. Once you've finished your stack, you place them in a spot on the stadium floor. I feel really stupid writing this.   In Quick Game mode, I managed to stack my cheerleaders high enough to where they reached the moon. I suppose if I had really concentrated I could have gotten higher, but after my 50th cheerleader I began to lose focus and not care. Miss the stack three times and your game is over. Get a high enough score and you can log it online to compare it other stackers. There is a Tell a Friend option and if you enter your cell phone number you'll receive a text message you can forward on to your friends. I tried this option so I could forward information about this game to everyone I knew but I kept getting an error message. Perhaps the gods were looking out for me.   I'm not sure what market this game is supposed to cater to. Puzzle enthusiasts? Is this a game for women? I handed it to my girlfriend and asked her to give it a try. She had fun stacking the cheerleaders and laughing when she'd miss and they'd fall of the stack. Then ten minutes went by and she claimed she was bored already and handed the phone back to me. Guess it doesn't market well to females either. Playing this made me think I had to open my mouth and drool on my own shirt so I felt like I was the intended audience.   Graphics reminded me of the 8-bit Nintendo days which is not a compliment. Every cheerleading team looked the same except for the color of their outfits or their skin tone. Sound effects were absent with only the sound of music in the background as you play. The music is the same loud trumpet loop and after thirty seconds of listening to it will cause your ears to bleed and test your will to live.   (Note from Levi: This game is based entirely on DChoc's hit Tower Bloxx -- it's essentially a re-skin. And since George hadn't played the original, I thought it would be interesting to see his fresh take. And, well, it was.)Alright gamers, here we go! Gimme a B! Gimme a O! Gimme an R! Gimme an I! Gimme an N! Gimme a G! Whats that spell? Stacked Cheerleaders! Woohoo! Hooray!!!!!", "date": "Nov 28, 2007"}
