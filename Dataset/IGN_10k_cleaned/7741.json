Well, in a nutshell, our largely apathetic answer is that you might as well. You see, it's difficult to review Wii Play in the traditional sense, given that what you're effectively getting bundled with your remote is an elaborate interactive tutorial, designed to familiarise the technically inept with the Wii's pointing functionality.   As it happens though, Wii Play not only manages to do that pretty well, it's also a surprisingly fun diversion for everyone else in the process. Of the nine games you'll find here, there's Shooting Range, Find Mii, Table Tennis, Pose Mii, Laser Hockey, Billiards, Fishing, Charge! and the equally exclamatory Tanks! While individually, there's little here that really ever rises above the mildly entertaining (a couple of gems aside), as a collective group, there's probably enough entertainment on offer to justify that additional five pound outlay.    Starting with Shooting Range, you've basically got a five-round variant on the classic NES light gun game Duck Hunt. In fact, nostalgia fans should have a field day here, with all the classic elements given a 3D facelift. Throughout the course of the game, you'll shoot balloons, targets, tin cans, clay pigeons and Mii-knapping flying saucers - there're even sporadic appearances by those titular ducks of yore although, as far as we can tell, there's no cameo for Duck Hunt's iconic sniggering dog. In all honestly, Shooting Range is probably one of our favourites in the entire package, thanks to its heady mix of addictive simplicity and retro familiarity.   Next in line is Find Mii, an equally straightforward observation game, requiring you to select Miis out of a line-up, based on a given criteria. Whether you're tasked with finding two of a kind, the odd-one-out, sleepyhead or fastest Mii, it's simply a case of pointing your cursor at the target and pulling the remote's trigger. Initially, we were pretty indifferent about this one but things do get a little more interesting later on. As you progress through levels, scoring precious extra seconds for the next round, you're forced to track Miis through the shadows with a flashlight beam, watch them cascade down an endlessly looping escalator and thunder en masse across a busy high street. Again, it's still pretty shallow, but the subtle shift in variety manages to keep things fresh enough for short bursts.    Paddle fans are amply served by the inclusion of Table Tennis and Laser Hockey. The first basically involves moving your bat left and right in an attempt to return the increasingly frantic shots from your opponent, while the latter is, essentially, air hockey with luminous paddles. Neither is all that immediately accessible however - moving your bat in Table Tennis requires a fair amount of precision, given the generally unforgiving sensitivity, and Laser Hockey suffers thanks to the odd design decision which causes your paddle to 'stick' to the edge of the table if you get too close. Truthfully, both are entertaining enough, although Table Tennis just about takes the edge, with an element of skill intrinsic to the proceedings.   Shoved unceremoniously between those two is Pose Mii, probably our least favourite of the Wii Play bunch. Here, you're tasked with popping constantly tumbling balloons before they reach the water below - the twist, literally, being that this requires aligning your Mii with the silhouette in each, ensuring you've adopted the appropriate pose (you can cycle through these via A and B). Sure, it introduces the concept of twisting the remote (used more effectively in Laser Hockey), but the whole thing is so repetitive, it gets tedious all too quickly. Interestingly, one of Nintendo's early Wii tech demos at this year's E3 - most of which have found their way into Wii Play in one form or another - featured almost identical game mechanics. However, there you were tasked with twisting and turning your Miis through a scrolling maze, avoiding its edges and obstacles. Compared to Pose Mii, it was a far more involving experience, so goodness knows where that particular idea will eventually find itself.     Billiards, meanwhile, offers one of the most fleshed-out elements of Wii Play. Skipping the rules of billiards themselves (because, frankly, you should have played enough mini-games in your life to know them by now), you use either the top-down or behind-the-ball views to line up your shot with the d-pad (or pointer by holding B and nudging the edge of the screen) then move the cursor over the cue ball. Depending where you place it, you've got control over topspin and backspin then, to take your actual shot, you simply hold down B, pull your remote back and push it forward with the required force before letting go of the trigger. As with much of Wii Sports, Billiards succeeds by marrying the onscreen action perfectly with your real-world movements, becoming all that more satisfying as a result.   Next up is Fishing which, ultimately, succeeds more as a demonstration of the Wii's potential rather than as a fully-rounded game in its own right, thanks to the somewhat imprecise nature of its controls. By shuffling your pointer around the screen, you can dangle your fishing rod into the water, move it forward and back to reach either side then tilt the remote up and down to raise and lower your rod. Your goal is basically to catch as many fish as possible in the time limit, with extra points awarded if you secure one of the fishes in the bonus box. Trouble is, controls are a tad over-sensitive and it's all too easy to unintentionally raise or lower your rod while you're trying to move around the water. Invariably, you'll hoist your hook away from your catch at exactly the wrong moment, causing unnecessary frustration.    Charge!, meanwhile, shakes things up a bit by doing away with that Wii pointing malarky altogether. Essentially, what you have here is a very basic racing game involving knitted cows, scarecrows and controls reminiscent of Nintendo's Excite Truck. Holding the remote horizontally, you tilt it left and right to slalom along the path - ramming scarecrows as you go - tip forward to increase your speed and flick upward to jump over obstacles. Despite its single, short track, Charge! manages to be an oddly compulsive addition to Wii Play, although it's doubtful you'll get as much mileage out of it as the package's stronger offerings - unless you really happen to like cows.   Last but not least then is Tanks!, which bucks the Wii Play trend by having optional support for the nunchuck. Admittedly though, it's all so mindlessly simplistic you're probably better off saving the time it takes to plug in the attachment to do something else. Ultimately, your goal is to trundle around the top-down maze and obliterate your opponent using either your mines or projectiles. It's quite a disappointing finale to the collection, lacking absolutely anything resembling depth.    Although undoubtedly a mixed bag, Wii play does have a couple of tricks up its sleeve, increasing its lasting appeal to a surprising degree. For example, simultaneous two-player mode is both enjoyable and competitive enough in short bursts to fill those empty moments. Similarly, Wii Plays single-player ranking system somehow turns even the most mundane mini-games into an oddly addictive clamour to achieve gold medal on each  particularly as your achievements are posted on the Wii message board for all to see and beat. Ultimately then, Wii Play serves its purpose admirably as a newcomer-friendly introduction to the Wiimote and theres enough here that rises above simple novelty to justify that extra outlay if youre in the market for a second controller. Unless you really need that fiver for something else, obviously.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
