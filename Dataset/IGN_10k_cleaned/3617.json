Frogger's simple, timeless gameplay design is now legendary. Hell, even George Costanza will testify to the addictive brilliance of the game.  Back in late 2000, developer Blitz Games was contracted by Hasbro Interactive to put together a brand new Frogger title: the aptly named Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge. The game was surprisingly good and was met with open arms on both the PC and Dreamcast platforms. But things have changed in the past two years, and now Blitz is hitting the code to produce a similarly successful gameplay experience for Infogrames -- except without the classic Frogger license.  Frogs, crickets, whatever. It really doesn't matter which side of the food chain you're on, so long as you're able to jump, jump, jump your way through various old-school inspired levels and rescue the respective critter in distress (your buddy who doubles as a TV antenna). Blitz Games is sticking by this creed in its latest multi-platform title, Zapper. But unfortunately, those gamers who enjoyed the previous Frogger efforts and are hoping for a return (or even improvement) on the revamped Frogger gameplay might be setting themselves up for a minor disappointment.  There really isn't enough drama in this insect world to justify the zapping action that ensues soon after hitting enter. As we've stated, your name here is Zapper, and you are a cricket. You have a brother named Zipper, and he is -- that's right -- a cricket. You love Zipper. When a mysterious winged villain kidnaps him, you are naturally concerned, especially since you were using him as a television antenna at the time.  Thus, it is your cricket duty to pounce after Zipper's captor, following and collecting a trail of eggs along the way. And that's about it, really. There aren't many storytelling devices employed throughout this quick adventure, except for a minute-long CG cut-scene leading up to the first level that conveys the exact same previously mentioned plot points in a more annoying fashion.  On the trail to reunite yourself with your kidnapped sibling, you'll run Zapper through a wacky collection of levels, ranging from outdoor lawns to tech-fancy factories. Each is completely linear, with a few minor secret areas tucked away on the sides. The camera hovers in a classic isometric, top-down perspective for a clean view of the crazy hopping action. Gameplay is laid out in a grid and is cleverly disguised to mesh with your surrounding environment. Players will tap, tap, tap their control pads or keyboards to move Zapper forward, back, left, or right. With each tap, he'll hop to the next square. You can also rotate Mr. Zapper in place, thus allowing you to get your bearings before you inadvertently plunge him off a deadly ledge. Since there's really no analog sensitivity in this formula, using the keyboard or an old Sidewinder is recommended. Besides giving tighter control, it adds a touch of that old-school feel.  Jumping into Zapper's story mode will put you at the start of about a 20 level quest to save your brother, Zipper. Along the way, you will be highly encouraged to snag six different eggs per level, thus allowing you to jump onward to the next one. In the early stages, Zapper will run across a few helpful pads where he can stop and get a quick gameplay tips from another random insect friend. Here you'll learn many handy things, such as how to perform a double-jump and how to ~zap~ the crap out of the baddies with your electrically charged antennae. Along the way, you'll also free some poor, innocent fireflies by pouncing on their spherical prisons and thus are able to summon their assistance at key points for an even bigger ~zap~ (breaking metal and crap).  Running through all 20 levels will take the experienced gamer no time whatsoever. We're talking half of a day at most, and that includes prolonged bathroom breaks and possibly a couple of solid naps. But on the other hand, there are some spots of the later levels where the dexterity required to keep poor Zapper from getting nicked by an enemy is far too demanding. Why, here's an example from early on: imagine yourself floating downstream on a log, with killer fishes jumping across your path, angry bees wandering up and down the nearby paths of toadstools, all the while you're drifting past important fireflies and eggs to collect and headed straight for a spike-laden wood mill. Sounds like a fun challenge, except for the fact that Zapper controls like a remote control chess rook with one leg: forward, backwards, left, and right -- one square at a time.  The control scheme takes some serious getting used to, as you often must to rotate the blasted cricket 90-degrees at a time before moving him, thus leaving you with little time for such actions as getting the hell out of the bee's way once you get him pointed in the right direction. It's a control scheme that works, but only the seriously dedicated Zapper fans will achieve the level of mastery required to keep the guy alive until the very end.      Players will also curse some of the trial-and-error encounters they'll find...   ~I wonder if I can jump on the brown furry thing? Oh, it looks like I can -- but wait! Apparently the brown furry thing is really a sleeping beaver that just woke up and ate me!~   It's a good thing the game starts you with 20 lives right off the bat and keeps them rolling throughout the stages, because you're really going to need them if you're intent on actually finishing the quest. Sometimes there's just no way to know if an object is friend or foe unless you take the plunge and experiment. And unfortunately, nine times out of 10, you're screwed.  Outside of the Story Mode, you'll also find a handful of quickly tossed together modes to fill out the main menu screen. None are really deserving of either game time or honorable mention, but alas, here they are. The Arcade Mode lets players play through any of the single-player levels in a variety of ways: time trial, ghost, or collect-the-fireflies. You get the idea. Regardless of which way you play, the basic pull is to get your green hinny to end of the level as fast as you can. Top times are stored in the record books. Yee-haw. We don't even get the bloody multiplayer mode the console versions ~boasted.~   When we last saw what Blitz Games could do on the PC and Dreamcast, we were impressed. This time around, the visuals in Zapper get the job done with a bit of style, but now aren't anything special. The colors are bright, the characters are plump and cartoony, and decent lighting effects radiate around the screen. As the little critter collects his fireflies, you'll see a brilliant white glow reflected and refracted all around the nearby landscape and characters. For the most part, the action keeps at a steady pace.  The character models and animations themselves are all up to par, although they're a bit generic in design. Think ~Antz meets A Bug's Life,~ and you'll have a pretty good understanding of what these little buggers have to wake up to in the mirror each morning. Again, it gets the job done, but does so without really invoking any creative style to call its own. Again, a serious turn off to those learned gamers looking for something fresh, but it'll get by with the more forgiving, younger crowd looking for something cute that doesn't look like an ape.  What did you think of Frogger, I mean Zapper?  You don't exactly play a game like this to be blown away with a killer audio tracks and surround effects, but then again, you surely don't want to be annoyed by them either. Sadly, that's exactly what you're getting when you crank up the Zapper noise on your fancy multimedia setup. Not since the restrictive cart-based days of the N64 have we heard tunes that were this repetitive in design. And that's not to say that they loop every 20 seconds, rather they're just designed completely devoid of any creativity and variety. Some levels are bad enough to force you to mute the system altogether, while others will simply just turn your mind to mush and allow your brain to ignore their existence altogether. Either way, the music is nothing to be proud of.  The rest of the audio elements are all good, including the sound effects and background noises. You'll hear cracks of thunder as little Zapper fries his foes, the buzz and thumps of nearby enemies, as well as a variety of chirps, whistles, and pops -- all crystal clear and right on cue. The audio elements certainly won't stick in your mind as the best of the bunch, but the good news is that they're all very fitting and won't detract from the gameplay experience in any way. If only the same could be said for Zapper's taste in music. Some games are going to be simpler in design than others, and, personally, I'm okay with that. I don't expect every new piece of software on the market to be the next Deus Ex. It's perfectly fine to tailor your gameplay experience around something of a less grand scale, with trimmed controls and clear-cut objectives. However, despite Zapper's best efforts to adhere to this philosophy, it fails. A game this simple should, at its core level of gameplay, be fun. As much as I wanted to love Zapper, I just couldn't allow myself to become addicted to any of the fun elements it had to offer. In this case, hopping through mildly decorated, linear 3D environments, collecting eggs, and scurrying out of harms way is really only as fun as it sounds on paper. But after 30 minutes to an hour of controlling the little bugger for yourself, the average to experienced gamer will come to the inevitable realization that these necessary gameplay elements just don't add up to a fun gameplay experience, especially since it's exactly like Frogger, only you uselessly fry crap with your electrified head. If you're new to 3D gaming, have a high tolerance for trial and error style play, and really have nothing better to do with your time, this one might interest you as you peruse the super bargain bin. Otherwise, just pretend to smile and be happy should you unwrap a gift from Grandma and find Zapper's pudgy face smiling right back at you.", "date": "Apr 23, 2003"}
