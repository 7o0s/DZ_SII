Take Majesco, for example  this is a company who's put out at least a dozen Game Boy Color games in the past year, most of which have been less-than-stellar. Oh, let's be blunt: most sucked, with the exception of the rendition of Frogger the company released a year and a half ago. You'd think all they're worried about is getting games on shelves just to sell on name alone. Add Ultimate Paintbrawl to that list  I've played freeware Shockwave whack-a-mole games on my PC that were more fun. Features Four different painball weapons Multiple levels Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Ultimate Paintbrawl utilizes the same graphics and gameplay engine as Morning Star's Deer Hunter Game Boy port for Vatical Entertainment. This should be the first indication that this was a game with an extremely short development cycle  change a deer to a paintball enemy, a rifle into a pellet gun, and call it a day.   And though it says ~paintball~ in bold letters, don't expect any essence of that sport portrayed here. The game is loosely based on the capture-the-flag idea, and it's not a ~one hit~ type of game  in fact, you can take many, many hits in the game and make it all the way to the fifth level with no problem. The developer worked with what the Deer Hunter engine offered -- which wasn't much to begin with -- and built a game around it, and what we got is a pointless action game with little to no skill required.   The whole game revolves around the idea of wandering around an overhead map to locate the enemy's flag  when you stumble into hazardous territory, the game switches to a sidescrolling environment where your feet are fixed in a central spot. Then it becomes a basic game of ~follow the arrow~ as the pointer at the top of the screen tells you where the enemy's going to ambush you  simply scroll the screen right or left, put the enemy under your crosshairs, and pull the trigger. If there's too many enemies on-screen, you have the option to lob a paint grenade to take out all on-screen enemies at once. If you take too long finding the enemy flag, the enemy will capture your flag, ending the game. That's the entire design of Ultimate Paintball.  The only saving grace is the tiny bit of strategy involved in finding the enemy's hidden flag(s). Wander onto an enemy icon in the overhead map and win the battle, and an arrow will be drawn up on the map pointing to where the flag is hidden. Then it becomes a game like ~Battleship~ where you pretty much hunt and peck the enemy into showing arrows that point at the flag  it's all a matter of deduction to locate the flag at this point. In later levels, an extra flag is added to the mix  up to three, depending on the level you've reached in the game. And the more victories you earn, the more points you acquire and the better gun you can purchase at the end of three rounds. Honestly, I doubt anyone has the patience to play a game this dull this far.  And while the game's packaging says ~One or Two Player Alternating mode,~ there's not any evidence of this fabled two-player mode. Maybe it was axed to get the game out on time, maybe it was never planned  who knows. Just don't believe the packaging whatever you do. In fact, if you have the game in-hand, put it back down. Thanks.  There have been many, many stinkers released for the Game Boy Color, and I'm confident to say that Ultimate Paintbrawl joins their ranks. It's a silly, pointless, anti-fun game with very little elements included to keep gamers fixed to the controller. Look, Majesco, I think it's time you actually smell the crap games you guys are putting out, because we know you know they're not exactly the cream of the crop. Would it kill you to focus on quality gaming the next time 'round?", "date": "Jun 21, 2000"}
