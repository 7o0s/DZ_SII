Konami revisited the series several years later on the Game Boy Color, producing an excellent sequel that built upon the established gameplay. Motocross Maniacs Advance attempts to reproduce the fun of the past two 8-bit portable titles, but the team involved in the process managed to muck up the game's simplistic design with too much new stuff without focusing on what made the original so good. Features Four modes of play Six different racers Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge) Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance.  This racing game puts players to the task of navigating side-scrolling courses that go up, down, and loop-de-doop through several different environments. The challenge is to come in first in each cup, out-racing the other three players to the finish line by picking up nitro and fuel icons, boosting off jumps to land on platforms that are faster lines in the course. You can even take out your opponents by picking up weapons such as missiles and land-mines, putting them to use when they get a little too close for comfort.  Other items are scattered around the tracks, including little guys that'll save your items if you manage to take a spill...normally you'll lose all your power-ups when you crack up after a jump. By successfully completing races, you'll unlock additional tracks and racers with different attributes.  Because Motocross Maniacs Advance continues the strictly 2D perspective, every player drives on the same plane...so there aren't any bike collisions other than the ones with either the missiles you shoot against opponents, or with the good ol' terra firma when you don't quite land your bike with the proper angle. This is the game's serious shortcoming, even though the past games utilized the same flat gameplay. The original games kept it simple, but the designers tried way too hard to throw in as much as possible on the little GBA screen. They beefed up the speed in Motocross Maniacs Advance, and this seriously shows off the original's weird physics; when it was at its normal speed on the Game Boy Color you could rotate your bike naturally to adjust for the angle of the platform you're landing on. At the GBA's much more rapid pace, though, it's a lot harder, and much more of a hassle to control the spin of your bike. And because of the game's weird controls, the additional moves available to the player cause more harm than good. Like the wheelie jump boost...by pressing left and the boost button, you'll leap into the air without the aid of a ramp. Unfortunately, since your thumb is still on the D-pad, your bike will rotate as soon as it's airborne, causing some nasty crashes if you're not quick off the controls. Not so good.  And even though the developers try to add more variety to the game by throwing in additional gameplay modes like a bomb tag and a ~zombie hunt~ style race, they're still stuck in the game's wonky gameplay engine. The only real thing this title's got going for it is its single cartridge multiplayer mode where anyone with a GBA system can join in the race. With this mode, it's a bit easier to overlook the game's shortcomings because you don't need to spend the extra dough on additional copies of the game. As I was playing through Konami's Motocross Maniacs Advance, I had to check back three years to my review of Motocross Maniacs 2 for the Game Boy Color; and after seeing the 8.0 score I gave that game in 1999, I felt like I was crazy because what I'm playing on the GBA is just not as much fun as I hoping to have. So, I pulled out the GBC game for a refresher...wow, I was right, the original game is so much better than this Game Boy Advance remake. Its gameplay has much tighter controls, and even more inviting is the ability to create your own tracks that can be traded with friends. Whichever team at Konami was responsible for the design of Motocross Maniacs Advance put way too much into a simple concept, and what we get on the GBA is a cluttered mess of a racer that bares very little resemblance to the game it follows...and definitely doesn't offer nearly as much fun.", "date": "Apr 12, 2002"}
