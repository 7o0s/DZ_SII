As a release the snuck its way onto the shelves and avoided detection from IGN's editors for almost two years, it's pretty clear that nobody wanted to be involved with this title. Sometimes you can find a rare gem out thee in Fry's land, but this isn't one of them.   Hard Hitter Tennis offers up a simple game for simple pleasures (ie. barely any). The graphics are sparse and ugly and the audio provides a backdrop only a softcore porn director could love. As for the gameplay, there's not a whole lot going on with rickety controls and a bizarre way to hit the ball. It all adds up to a mess of a game that can be quickly skipped in favor of pretty much every other tennis game out there.   Let's begin with the basic hitting of the ball. Instead of just tapping the ball, the game teaches the player in the Training Levels (more on that later) to hold down the button to charge a shot and release, Sure, this may be an appropriate simulation of drawing back the racket to hit the ball in real life, but it's still clumsy to have to hold the button down while moving around. There's also the issue of control of the shot since the amount of pressure applied to the button determines the energy put into the shot.    In theory, this should mean that a slight tap would create a soft hit while a button mash sends it flying. In practice, the shots were bangers or, when I barely touched the controller, whispers and not a whole lot of stuff in between. Serves are done in the same way with the skill part being just how miniscule an amount of pressure you can use on the button to get a serve that's not full power. Tap the button for what most mortals would consider a mere nanosecond and the game turns that into a 100 mph serve.    Pair this system up with a clumsy control scheme for hitting the ball that seems to make no sense in terms of aiming and you get some barely controlled chaos on the court. With the same shots in near identical situations, pushing the left analog all the way to one side would either send a shot down the middle or out of court off to the side. It's a frustrating experience that reminds me of my own experience playing tennis some ten years ago.   So with this awkward system, there's a World Tour mode, and Exhibition mode, a Training mode and a Mini Game mode. Of these, only the Exhibition mode is truly worth checking out. The Training mode covers the basics of hitting a ball and serving it and barely anything else while the Mini Games only offer up three varieties, one of which requires two other players. After playing the two solo options that cover some basic aiming for a few minutes, all fun has pretty much been exhausted. The only thing left is to play some friends or go on tour.   Playing with friends is pretty self-explanatory and worked as well as it could for the short time that it held our interest. If you want to remain friends with your friends, I'd strongly recommend playing in the World Tour. It's not fantastic, not by a long shot, but it provides plenty of matches against computer opponents and a stat system for developing a character. Unfortunately, all of the stats are automatic. By rising through the ranks, different abilities are instantly improved by winning. There's no ~under the hood~ feeling of tweaking players in different ways and this is a glaring error. It keeps up with the game's goal of providing a bland experience without much of the thrill of the game and getting lost in the details.   As if all of this weren't bad enough, there's the bland graphical treatment and the audio which is something that I'm already trying to wipe from my memory. The music is a cheesy guitar solo fest with many ~emotional~ segments to make the simple goings on much more dramatic. Even better, the commentary has random comments that try to spice up the action, but instead sound like your lame uncle who always tries to crack corny jokes at Thanksgiving. You just keep hoping that you'll be able to tune out his voice, but it never works.   All in all, Hard Hitter Tennis is definitely a tennis game, no doubt about it. But it's barely worth being on a PS2, much less a console at all. The feeling of tennis is lost and what remains is something that will provide giggles in the future, but barely any genuine entertainment.All in all, Hard Hitter Tennis is definitely a tennis game, no doubt about it.
