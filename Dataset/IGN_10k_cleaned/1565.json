Ol' Boss Hog is up to his ol' tricks and it's up to Bo and Luke to hop in the General Lee to save Uncle Jedd's farm. But the adventure goes well beyond that in this here fun portable game. Features 27 missions Race in the General Lee, Cooter's Truck, Daisy's Jeep Battery back-up (four save slots) Only for Game Boy Color Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home is a mission-based driving game -- picture Driver in Redneck-ville and you've got a good idea of what to expect. At the beginning it's a racing game featuring everyone's favorite Dodge Charger, but then it evolves into a rescue operation when you have to race to find Uncle Jesse's truck. Then it becomes a chase scene where you'll have to chase after the truck and disable it from getting away. The game's been built in a linear fashion that follows a direct storyline, and each mission is a part of the story. And the game doesn't limit itself to the General Lee -- in some missions you'll control Daisy's Jeep or Cooter's Truck.   The game has been developed by Spellbound Interactive, the same team responsible for the soon-to-be-released Toca Touring Car Championship. And if you've seen that excellent racing game in action, you'll recognize the same game engine at work in Dukes of Hazzard. Cars slide when speeding on dirt, but turn on the dime when driving more carefully, and all the cars have been modeled in several positions, giving the driver a lot more directional control. And all the vehicles actually feel heavy -- they throw their weight around, and that feel is well-translated in the controls. At the very least, the game handles very well.   A few elements have been added to the engine to give the game more of a Dukes of Hazzard feel. In some missions you'll have to pick up arrow icons, which will give you the ability to shoot out roadblocks from a distance. And, of course, there are scenarios where you'll have to jump over ravines and gorges to make a getaway from ol' Rosco in hot pursuit.  The graphics, though, are downright hideous. Everything about the imagery -- cars, land texture, buildings, cutscene characters -- have an ugly, dithered and blocky construction, and it makes the game that much more difficult to look at when driving around Hazzard County. It's amazing how drastic a game can look using the same game engine -- Spellbound's upcoming Toca Touring Car looks much better than this muddy game. At the very least, the cutscenes with the characters could have used the system's higher-color mode -- and maybe actual digitized photos from the show instead of rendered stills from the PC game.  But it's a long-lasting racing adventure -- with 27 missions, some more challenging than others, it's a good thing the developers felt that battery would be better than a password save. The game screams for link-cable support, though -- this is the type of game that would have benefited greatly from missions featuring a Rosco-versus-Duke Boys deathmatch.  The game doesn't offer anything more than just driving levels, but the missions vary enough to continue through the adventure to the very end of the tale in Hazzard County. It's a sort of hit-or-miss license -- the Dukes of Hazzard wasn't for everyone, and it really hasn't had mass appeal for over a decade. But if you liked the show, you'll probably like the game for its parallels. Other folk'll like it for its fun missions. Just don't go blind from the horrid graphics.", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
