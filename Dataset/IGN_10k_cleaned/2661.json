I've played enough of these games to get a pretty good handle on what makes the good ones work. One of the newer entries into the mix is straight from our oh so French friends in umm... well, France. Monte Cristo has been throwing games onto the market for a while now and has managed to create some business simulations in the past that really weren't too bad. But Factory Mogul manages to miss in so many areas that it's hard to believe that the designers behind the game really took the time to think about what goes into a game like this to make it fun. You know, more fun than a factory that makes toilets. Or latrines as they refer to them. Quoi que.   Basically, Factory Mogul really isn't a horrible idea. Sure it sounds boring (and is boring in the long run) but for the first little while it was interesting and entertaining. Then I realized it's about as deep as that kiddie pool half-full of pee at the local rec. Where'd the creativity go? Where'd the depth of business model go? It's like they dumbed it down for all involved so no one really had to think or suffer from too much stimulation.   Factory Mogul is about as bland as the name. Upon first loading up the game, you're treated to a really bad (although intentionally so I think) and slightly funny song setting up the game. Seems you messed up in college and didn't study nearly as much as you should have. Now you're trying to start out and grow a crappy dumphole factory into a productive giant cause no one will hire you on. You do this by creating a research lab, a production facility, an administrative office (for the lawyers and hr people), a sales and marketing department, security, and an industrial espionage department full of mobsters. The problem is, there aren't a whole lot of options in any of these areas. Let's dissect them, shall we?   The first thing you'll need to do is check out your entire factory. Each of those departments has one room to itself, which you can improve in certain ways. But no matter what, each of the rooms will always be the same size, hold the same number of workers, and have the same graphical upgrades. There's no room for creativity here. What I would have liked is to have a basic lot, like in The Sims or Dungeon Keeper, that you can build rooms in where your people can work. They should connect to each other with hallways and doors and so on and so forth. As it is, each of the rooms is actually a different building disconnected from the rest. And there's no way to change the shapes or make them bigger.   But let's take a look at them one by one. First, the research room. This is pretty much where you have to start off your factory production. You have to have researched products in order to produce them, right? There are up to four different parts you'll need to create a product, whether that be a toilet, roller blades, or a robot. There are four levels of research for each of these parts and three options per level, which, when we break out the trusty calculator here, equals 12 possible choices for each of the parts. In order to produce a level 3 part, your worker, and your work bench have to be level 3 as well. And sometimes you'll have a requirement like purchasing an extra gizmo before you can research the higher level pieces. You can only fit four researchers in here on the four tables. And the researchers are pretty uninteresting. Instead of wandering around the lab using equipment and doing interesting things like they do in games like Startopia and Dungeon Keeper, they just sit at their desk punching on the keyboard.   But the worst part of researching is the interface. You have to individually give each of your researchers orders by first clicking on them, which is awkward enough, and then clicking on the action tab, and then selecting the part you want to research, and then the specific model of that part you want to research, and then clicking the okay tab. You have to do this for each of your researchers, even if you want them all to work on the same thing. There's no overview interface that lets you queue items for research up. There's no easy screen where you could check off that you want all, or some, or your researchers to work on one thing... how hard would that have been for crying out loud?   Next you have the production room, where the magic happens. You need a foreman and his workstation, up to four workers and their workstations, and you need to have all of them at the right level to make the right parts. Same as in the research lab. This could use the same interface improvements. One screen showing all of your people and parts and upgrade buttons so that you didn't have to click on each of them individually.    Next we have the administration and the sales departments, which I'll lump together because, however important they are for the game, you'll hardly ever have to touch them and they're even more uninteresting than the rest of the rooms. You'll see your lawyer and your accountant and your salesman and your marketer and your human resources sitting at their desks typing. That's about as exciting as watching my roommate cook eat her boring ass plain tofu with plain yogurt topping. Every now and again you'll have your hr manager inspire people's morale and will see her pack gifts until the section of the company she's been charged with inspiring has had their flagging spirits uplifted. That's about as fun as these two rooms ever get.   Otherwise you'll just click on each of the workers and set some sliders as to what of two tasks you want them to do more and leave them be unless something really goes wrong.   Then there's the security provided by ~Systmes Inutiles De Secutiry~. No matter how far you upgrade your security post (the highest level shows tank and machine turrets), or your building's individual security system, or your guard's level and efficiency level, your buildings will still be broken into. Your factory will be sobotaged every couple of minutes. Your research will be stolen constantly. And your security guard will be running laps while his attack dog sits grinning like a lunatic just waiting for another Scooby Snack. There's no option to set patrols or hire more security, it's just something that's there or not there. That's all you get and if it's not good enough for you then you can rot in hell! Once you figure out who's sabotaging you, you can sick your lawyer on them each time they do it, costing them 100,000 a pop. But once you get things going, you can make much more than that with your products in the time it takes to fix your machines, meaning that your inept security costs you millions of dollars. Where's the laser beams and pressure plated floors and the poison gas traps?   And finally there's the outside ~morally ambiguous~ area where your mobster friends hang out. If you're into the whole espionage thing, you can contact the mob via your accountant and set up a post for them out back. After that, you can access spies and mobsters. With spies, you can steal info and sabotage opposing factories like I was explaining. Supposedly it only works if your spy is a higher level than the security guard. But it never really seemed to make any difference either way. I would have liked to see this as a mini game of its own where you control the saboteur on his mission. Even something as simple as was in Fast Food Tycoon. But no. That would go against the boring plan.    What did you think of Factory Mogul? Factory Mogul has the very beginnings of a good game that could have grown into something along the lines of a mix between Roller Coaster Tycoon and Dungeon Keeper. Which when you think about it makes perfect sense. But there's no real space for creativity. You can't buy new better and bigger lots and craft your own factories. You can't buy a corporate headquarters different from your factories. You can't see your workers ever take breaks or go home. There's not even a breakroom. I could always understand when one of my employees decided to quit...    You'll also find more missing that would have been fun to see like unions. There's no personal salary. There's no embezzling into a Swiss bank account. How can you run a company without skimming more off the top? This is business right? Aren't we supposed to be a little greedy here?   The thing is, even outside the limited scope of imagination, Factory Mogul isn't a good business simulation. Those that are serious about running the show will want to look elsewhere like Trevor Chan's Capitalism II or even Railroad Tycoon II. There's a reason the game was originally called Crazy Factory, which I'm guessing is because they wanted it to be light-hearted and fun. Hey, at least they succeeded in the light-hearted part.In short, whatever personality I thought this game originally had due to the cute cartoony characters was forgotten long ago. There's no fun animations. There's not even any short cut scene type cinematics for events to keep you interested. The lack of pride the developers had in this game is visible. It was thrown out the door to make money somehow, when with a little bit of effort and imagination, the idea (which actually seems a little boring to begin with) could have been turned into an fun and addicting foray into business. But instead we're left with a lifeless and shallow game that I won't recommend to anyone.", "date": "May 13, 2002"}
