You've got it with Bandits: Phoenix Rising, a particularly mindless, yet fun, game set in a post apocalyptic world filled with gear heads and auto junkies. While the game certainly has its fast paced fun and frolic, it's not without its problems, mainly those of repetition and frustration. What we're left with is a pretty average game that will manage to entertain you for a while, but won't sit among your collection for longer than it takes you to finish the single player.   Bandits: Phoenix Rising follows the exploits of two men, Fennic and Rewdolf. These two lads are a pilot and gunner team for the Wolf Pack bandits, one of the four powerful clans found outside the walls of the lone city Jericho. While their story is pretty bare, it does involve a little tiny bit of twisting and adventure as you find out about a super weapon inside the walls of Jericho, even if it is mostly predictable.    Within the story's Mad Max-like post apocalyptic wasteland setting, all of the gangs fight it out for control of oil and whatnot to keep their ramshackle armored vehicles up and running. Each of the groups has their own little thing going for them, which is trite but fun. The Wolf Pack are the feared scrappers of the bunch with some of the best drivers and gunners of the wasteland. The Flaming Pumpkins, Enclave, and Crusaders fill out the rest of the personality spectrum by being plunder happy yokels, religious fanatics, and hard core military goons. They've all got their own style of doing things which you'll begin to recognize in their cars.   Your own cars come in different shapes an sizes and can be loaded out with different weapons, which may be better for specific missions. Most of the time, you'll be able to choose which car you'd like to bring in to complete each level, and will be able to load it out appropriately beforehand as well. Every now and again, you'll be forced to play with a specific vehicle or in one case a stationary turret, just to keep with a theme. As you progress through the single player game, you'll open up new weapons and vehicle chassis that have more hard points for weapons and more armor. This also makes them slower so you won't always want to choose the biggest baddest piece of car available to you. In fact some missions, you'll want to dip down to the fastest and lightest car to get the job done.   But most of the time, you won't know that until you've actually tried to play through the missions, which can be pretty difficult. You'll find yourself playing missions multiple times to complete them by the end. The game only allows you to save between missions, which is odd. It doesn't even automatically save each mission for you so that you can go back and play any specific one.     Actually controlling the game can be a bit difficult at times, but considering the alternatives, they actually did a pretty good job of it. You'll actually control both Fennic and Rewdolf in the game, meaning you drive and shoot simultaneously. The driving method is easy enough, you move the mouse and the car goes where you look. Driving the different vehicles takes some different skills as the biggest car is a trial to move around over hilly terrain. The physics engine is fairly realistic in most cases with the way the cars react. My only real gripe was that the cars wouldn't stay still unless the brake was held down and even then tended to slide down tiny slopes anyway.   The mouse also serves as your aiming reticule for the turret that Rewdolf sits in. As you turn the car, the turret will turn a little bit ahead of the car allowing you to shoot through the turn. You can also hold down the shift key at any time allowing you free control of the turret without turning the car, allowing you to drive one direction and shoot anywhere around the car, including at any cars attacking you from behind. The only problem with this is that you could find yourself driving off a cliff if you aren't careful as you can't see where you're going when controlling the turret separately. You can still control the car with the keyboard when you're holding down the shift key however, so maneuvering is possible.   Aside from the turret, the cars also have stationary secondary slots that hold anything from shotguns and chain guns to missile launchers and mines. The difference about these guns is that, because they're stationary, they only shoot forward or backward so you have to aim with your car. Still, if you manage to connect, you can do some pretty good damage.   You'll need all of your weapons and twitch reflex in order to get through the missions as they're filled to the brim with enemies. Unfortunately, the missions are also a lot of the same. While there are varied mission objectives such as search and destroy, defense, escort and even one where you control a stationary turret outside of  base, most of them boil down to the same combat where you'll be fighting to take out some enemies. Occasionally, you'll have some computer controlled allies to help you out, which makes the game a little more fun, but honestly, the combat is a lot of the same. The fact that it is still fairly entertaining after a while is actually kind of amazing, so I suppose you have to give up some props for that.   Like the combat, the environments are also pretty damn repetitive. Sure, it looks like a wasteland. But damn that's a boring wasteland. Stick some more burned out buildings or cities or bases or something. Most of the levels are brown rolling hills and some brown crags. Sure, you'll run into the occasional landmark like a bridge or a nifty base, but not often enough to make you think you haven't been cheated in some way.   On the other hand, the vehicles in the game look very good and take advantage of some of the better features in the new graphics cards. If everything in the game had been done to that kind of detail instead of the monotonous desert, or with at least some flair of art, the game would have been better off. Repetitive combat over repetitive terrain does not equal repeated fun.   Sound in Bandits can be good at times and well, not so good at others. The voice of Rewdalf takes the winning cake as a fun and entertaining foul-mouth thick with Scottish brogue, even though I swear he said he was Spanish somewhere in the game. While his voice is fantastic, the same can not be said for all of them. Fennic in particular is almost there, but just sounds too awkward at times like you could tell the actor was just reading the lines off a paper in front of him. The leader of the Crusaders is fairly funny as well with his stiff delivery and strange pacing, but he too missed by a pinch. Regardless, it was all fun to listen to, even if it made me feel stupid for laughing afterwards.   The music however is not good. While they boast a good amount of music that you can upload into your MP3 player to listen to outside of the game, you've got some serious musical difficulties if you take advantage of all of the craptacular techno and metal riffs screeching through the game.   Multiplayer seems almost like an afterthought in this one sadly. What could have been filled with some interesting modes to take more advantage of vehicular combat is instead made up entirely of deathmatch modes. While it manages to be a small bit of fun for a while, you'll definitely be looking back into your collection for something more interesting after a couple of tries.  There's nothing wrong with a little mindless action every now and again. Heck it's even a nice change of pace. Bandits may not be changing the face of gaming, at all, but it is going to give some people a fun distraction to fool around with. It isn't deep, it isn't innovative, and it isn't particularly remarkable, but it is a fast paced and fun shooter for those looking for a new car combat game. I've seen the game offered up for 30 bucks at some stores, both online and off, which isn't a terrible price for the game, but you may want to wait till it hits the bargain bin to enjoy some time with Fennic and Rewdalf.", "date": "Apr 16, 2003"}
