It's a tough spot to fill, as the thunder of being one of the original has already been stolen by three other releases in the genre, and it will inevitably be compared to other games already on the market. And though it has to share the spotlight with similar games in the genre, Dark Arena ends up a rather nice game on the handheld. It does have a handful of gameplay and graphical quirks that force it below two out of the three ~competitors~ on the GBA, but it's a quality game nonetheless and definitely recommended. Features 20 levels  Six different weapons  Prerendered FMV sequences  Link cable support for four players (multi-cartridge) Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Dark Arena's scenario isn't much of a stretch from the usual corridor shooter fare-- you've been put in the role of a special operations team leader, trapped in a genetic lab training facility overrun by some of the nastiest beasties imaginable. What's a gal to do? Pick up a blaster and make Swiss cheese out of these baddies to get the heck out of there.  This first-person shooter was developed by Graphic State Games, a European development team previously responsible for Midway's Cruis'n Velocity for the Game Boy Advance. In fact, that racing game used the core engine that the team developed for Dark Arena, showing off how versatile their programming engines can be moved to different designs. But in this case, the engine originated as a first-person shooter, and Dark Arena is the team's first crack at the genre...at least on the Game Boy Advance. And in many cases, the team succeeds -- it's not much of a stretch beyond what id Software established in Doom, and it seems that Graphic State used the classic FPS as a sort of foundation for their own design. The only real differences are in the character, level, and weapon designs...the gameplay is extremely similar to Doom otherwise. And believe me, that's not a bad game to clone.  Like Doom, Dark Arena is a flat-out run-and-gun shooter that grows increasingly difficult as you progress through the game's 20 different levels. Early in the game you're faced with nothing but easy-to-kill beasties that take nothing more than the power of your standard issue pistol to eliminate...but watch out for some brutal bad guys that move fast and pack a powerful punch. The AI in Dark Arena really could use a tweak or two, though, because in several cases I've had these enemies just stop in place as if I wasn't even in the room...only when I fired the weapon did they snap back to attention and try and hunt out my position. Luckily that only happens on a semi-rare basis.  The graphic engine itself is, obviously, key to how well the game plays on the handheld. As a whole, Dark Arena moves at an impressive clip, especially when there are only one or two enemies in sight. Room designs can get complex with angled rooms and multi-height ledges, but they are limited to the same restrictions that are set in other similar FPS games...no bridges or tunnels that intersect pathways. And though the vertical walls are the only surfaces with textures, the developers successfully cheat by adding a faint dithered mesh over the ceiling and floors. And the multiplayer elements are definitely a welcome addition, with the engine keeping the action playable for all four players in the game.  But the engine does bog down and chop up when a) entering a room with three or more active enemies, and b) getting so close to a single enemy he's just a mass of pixels. This framerate problem can, and does, cause some serious issues when they're all firing slow-moving projectiles in your direction and you can't see them gradually approach your position. And there are several ~sticky~ spots that will cause your character to latch to walls, and the only way to free yourself is to rock the D-pad back and forth.  I definitely think the most noticeable fault with Dark Arena is its overall lack of flair. Sure, it's a lot of fun to play, but there's not a whole lot of ~oomph~ that action games require for that necessary adrenaline rush. When enemies die, they flump to the ground in two bland frames of animation. When you blow up a series of barrels, they just explode in a tiny, uneventful blast. Wander through a teleporter, and you're instantly in a different part of the level without any graphical glitz. It definitely would have benefited the game's enjoyment had there been more action-style fluff involved. But as it is and despite the quirks, Graphic State and Majesco put together a fun action design for the Game Boy Advance And there is a positive to coming out fourth -- if you're already done blasting down imps in Doom and wiping out the SWAT teams in Ecks vs. Sever, you've now got 20 satisfying levels to blast a handful of genetic freaks in Dark Arena.", "date": "Jan 31, 2002"}
