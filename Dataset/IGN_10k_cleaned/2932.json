Well, this is carrying things a bit too far.  Psychic Detective is a port from the 3DO that should've been left to die along with the machine. It's bad. Really bad. You play a psychic who makes a living using your powers to do detective work. You get caught up in a murder, and have to use your powers to solve the crime before more deaths occur. Too bad Trip Hawkins didn't have some of that psychic power, huh kids?  With over five hours of FMV to trawl through, Psychic Detective is more like a really long B-movie than any kind of game you'd actually want to play. The point and click interface is so easy as to be almost pointless, and the acting is just plain awful. If you really want to watch something this bad, rent Rowdy Roddy Piper's film debut ~Hell Comes To Frog Town.~ At least that's funny.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
