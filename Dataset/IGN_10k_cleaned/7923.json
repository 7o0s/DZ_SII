The inclusion of a Wii Sports disc in each North American Wii box is an industry oddity, a rare free game incentive that hasn't been seen since the 16-bit era. In those days, Super NES gamers could find Super Mario World bundled with their freshly-purchased systems, while Genesis adopters found this game, Altered Beast.   Many remember Sonic as the 16-bit Sega flagship game, and rightfully so  the hedgehog went head-to-head against Mario in 1991 and afterward. But the Genesis system was around for a few years before that fight began, having first launched in North America in August of 1989. It was with that very first wave of Genesis hardware that the earliest adopters found Altered Beast freely accompanying their 200 dollar consoles. The game was a port of one of Sega's most popular arcade titles of the time, a side-scrolling brawler themed with ancient Greek environments and a shape-shifting gameplay mechanic.   ~Rise from your grave~ is the call to action as Greek god Zeus commands you, a long-dead warrior, to resurrect yourself and save his kidnapped daughter. She's the goddess Athena, captured by the villainous necromancer Neff, and it's up to you (and perhaps a friend) to punch, jump and kick your way through forced-scrolling levels full of Neff's underworld underlings before challenging and defeating the overlord himself. Along the way you'll encounter floating, collectible power-up orbs  grabbing them will gradually transform your hero into progressively more muscular forms, until the third acquired completely metamorphosizes your macho man into a brutal, brawling beast.   There are four different altered forms, including a fireballing werewolf, a lightning-launching dragon and a bear with the power to cartwheel, Ringling Bros. style. Which form you get depends on which stage you're in, meaning no mixing and matching your favorites. It's a linear fighting formula, all the way to the end.   And that way is not very long. Altered Beast is a short experience, with each level taking only a small time to clear completely and the entire adventure containing only five levels total. The game feels shortchanged, too, in its selection of animal transformations  the beast you become in the game's last stage is simply a recolor of the Level 1 wolf.    But Altered Beast's length isn't its own lacking element. Compromise can be seen, too, in most all of its other aspects. Its graphics are large and colorful, and were a strong achievement for home console gaming in 1989  but they still didn't match the level of detail and vibrancy seen in the game's arcade edition. The sound is restricted. This Genesis version has been ridiculed for years for its garbling of Zeus's and Neff's digitized voice clips, which make the characters' speeches more laughable than ominous. Control is also an issue  playing feels stiff, the heroes unresponsive. An arcade game ported to a home console, now re-offered on a different system. Any fluidity of feel the original had was lost somewhere on the way to the Wii.     Altered Beast just isn't that full of a game design. But then, it wasn't meant to be. It was meant more as a showcase piece, something to demonstrate the power of the 16-bit Genesis in a time when the 8-bit NES was all most gamers knew or cared about. It was meant to show that Sega offered ~the true arcade experience~ right in your living room. (Not to the discriminating eye, but at least much closer to the arcade that what Nintendo could claim.) It served that purpose, setting the new system apart from the competition. But it was all just surface flash. Altered Beast, as a game, was a limited experience, really only worth the amount Day 1 Genesis adopters paid for it  nothing.  It was great for free, as a packed-in Genesis cartridge back in 1989. Its not so great, or even good, for 800 Points, as a digitally downloadable Virtual Console title on the Wii today. Altered Beast should only be considered for download by Sega gamers of yesteryear, nostalgic to re-experience this arcade port in all its voice-distorting glory. Other players simply looking for fresh and inventive games from the Genesis back catalog would be better served spending their Wii Points on pretty much any other Sega title on offer. Pack-ins may be making a comeback, but Altered Beast is one old bundled bonus that you wouldnt have missed much if it had been left out of the box.", "date": "Jan 17, 2007"}
