It's from the Activision Value Publishing line, and this time is cunningly priced at $9.99, which immediately makes me wonder: What else could I do with ten bucks besides take a chance on a budget game? I could go see a movie, rent two or even three movies, rent a couple console games, buy a CD on sale, or have a nice lunch with a big, tasty sandwich and a delicious beverage of my choosing. Or I could cleverly not spend the money at all. Personally, I wouldn't chance my ten bones on Delta Ops.  Out of the box, it has a surprising amount of features right out of the box. There's highly customizable graphical adjustments, support for up to 1600x1200 resolution, four different sound modes (DirectSound, Aureal 3D, EAX 2.0 and 3.0), four different audio sliders for weapons, general sound fx, music, and master volume, and multiplayer that allows the server to set limits on what weapons and character models you can choose, in addition to about a dozen other server options.  This attention to detail carries over into the game, to a certain extent. Going through the training camp will show you that weapons have kick that force you to push the mouse down a little to aim straight. Semi-automatic fire is more accurate than full auto. You can only carry one rifle and one sidearm at a time. Bullet casings come flying out as you shoot and you can hear them hitting the ground individually. You can lean, switch to third-person perspective, whip out binoculars, and use night vision. If only higher-budget action games generally had all these features. However, leaning doesn't tilt your perspective around a corner so much as it just rotates what you're looking at, and the enemies can still pick you off, which is especially deadly when they're only aiming at your head. It would be nice to be able to lie prone, too, and this is a noticeable omission in a military action game.    But, as you can tell from the score, there are problems with the actual execution. First of all, it's often quite difficult to tell where you are on the map. It doesn't show you where you are, only where you need to go. This favors realism, of course, but it's also a PDA-style display which implies that you should be hooked into some kind of locator like GPS. Second, the enemies have some ridiculously accurate aim and they dash left and right as fast as dervishes, while hitting you with deadly accuracy.  This wouldn't be so bad if they didn't get the drop on you almost all the time. Having very little element of surprise is also aggravating because you'll be dealing with an unrealistically large amount of enemies. It's a truly Rambo ratio most of the time, but you don't have the arcade-style abilities to take them on. The real punch in the kidney is that there's no in-mission save or even periodic auto-saving. The levels aren't too large, thankfully, but you will find yourself repeating the same sections many times before you actually figure out the trick to each area. There really isn't much finesse to it, since the enemy generally stand and shoots at you, or does that dodge and weave thing like someone's throwing rocks at them instead of firing bullets.  Thanks to some nicely modeled recoil, the weapons act fairly realistically. There's no scope drift, so you can have problems with multiplayer unless the server has sniper rifles disabled. The zoom function is also a bit awkward. Instead of being controlled by the scroll button or the keyboard, zoom power is determined by how long you hold down the right mouse button. To zoom out you have to leave the scope view and tap the right mouse button instead of holding it down. But it's nice to know you can't just hold the trigger down and cut a swath of destruction, when the whole theme is meant to be realistic.  Sound is also pretty solid. Walking on a wooden floor produces squeaking, and water makes splashy sounds, so that's nice. There are a few missions where you'll paint some air strike targets, and those will make some booming explosions, although the fire animations are small and unimpressive. Gunfire is positional, so you can home in on a target no matter which direction you're pointing in.  The maps are also pretty bad. The geometry is extremely blocky and the textures are blurry. Never did I feel like I was in the Middle East so much as in some rock canyons that had been painted with sand textures, like the maps had been borrowed from some other game. The character models are similarly low poly and repetitive, and poorly animated to boot. About the only clear thing Delta Ops has going for it visually is some solid lighting effects in certain areas. Even at ten bucks, there are better ways to spend your money. Even though the graphics are basic enough to play on a low-grade system, and multiplayer might offer some momentary diversion, I'd rather surf the bargain bin for some ~oldie but goodies~ that have gradually made it down to that section, rather than get a game that seemed designed for it. The feel of Delta Ops is several years out of date, with blocky graphics, simplistic animation and basic AI, even thought it has a surprising amount of realism and graphical customization. I don't think this could have much more appeal beyond some cheap LAN gaming, but even then, there are plenty of bargain-bin priced games that will offer more in this department as well. When it's possible to find Unreal Tournament 2003 for under $20, there really is no contest, unless you have a low-powered rig--in which case, the free Natural Selection Half-Life mod would be more your speed, as well as Day of Defeat or even The Specialist.", "date": "Jan 26, 2004"}
