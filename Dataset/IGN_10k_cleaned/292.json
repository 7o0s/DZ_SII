{"name": "737 for Fly!", "name_review": "Fly!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/06/fly-2", "text": "So here I am trying to find the house where I was born in Dallas and I think I've made a terrible mistake.  Have I accidentally installed Microsoft's Flight Simulator version 1.0?  Did I screw up some sort of graphics option and configure the game for a 386/40?  Perhaps this is how Dallas/Ft. Worth would look after an Apocalypse.  Not only are there precious few buildings in the supposedly high-detail regions, but the land everywhere seems to have been brutally flattened as if the hand of God descended from Heaven and stamped down any elevation greater than a speed bump.  The entire U.S. is a level empty wasteland.  Metaphor for American culture or the latest flight sim?  This is Terminal Reality's Fly!, a general aviation sim competing against three other titles currently on the market: Looking Glass' Flight Unlimited III, Sierra's Pro Pilot, and Microsoft's Flight Simulator Version Whatever.  It is hands down the worst of them all.  Comparisons to Microprose's disappointing Falcon 4.0 are a no-brainer.  Both sims were preceded by high expectations, fueled in part by the developer's claims.  Both were obviously released prematurely, hitting the shelves with bugs prancing proudly in the code.  And now both seem to be the subject of ongoing post-release patchwork by their developers; these efforts may last until long after the games are being played by anyone. Sadly, both sims seem to suffer from design limitations beyond the capacity of any patch to fix.  Fly!'s biggest problems are its misplaced emphasis on avionics, its lack of adequate documentation, and its indestructible titanium miracle planes.  Fly! does an exquisite job of modeling detailed and functional dashboards for each of its five aircraft, from the relatively rudimentary Cessna Skyhawk's simple layout to the jaw-dropping complexity of a Hawker jet's expansive cockpit.  If you're the kind of guy who has always wanted to lean into the cockpit of a jet airliner and ask the pilot about specific buttons, you'll love the detail here.  Curious about that tiny toggle switch at the bottom left of the King Air's panel?  Hold your cursor there and pop-up text will tell you what it is.  Unfortunately, this attention to detail doesn't extend beyond the plane's interior.  In the Real World (tm), pilots have two modes of navigating their aircraft: instrumental flight rules, by which they get their bearings using navigational aids like non-directional beacons, high-frequency radials, and global positioning systems; or visual flight rules, by which they follow rivers, highways, and other landmarks to note their position.  While Fly! will let you use instrumental flight rules more fully than any other commercial sim, it's does an abysmal job with visual flight.  Lots of the terrain data is clearly fudged, from bad elevation figures to missing rivers to inaccurate coastlines.  Not only is there not much to look at outside the windows, but it's hard to have confidence in what little is actually there.  Fly! seems to dismiss the entire world with the assumption that devoted flight simmers would rather gaze at a lovingly detailed true-to-life dashboard than a mountain range.  And although these avionics systems are stunning, they are some of the most poorly documented features I've seen since Activision shipped their A-10 sim without a manual.  The documentation in Fly! does a horrible job of explaining all this detail.  A quick look at the Hawker's dashboard and any casual gamer would run screaming for a game of Minesweeper; a dedicated flight simmer would utter a squeal of delight and run for the manual.  Unfortunately, he wouldn't find anything beyond the basics.  Terminal Reality does their hard work a horrible disservice by leaving most of it entirely unexplained.  Furthermore, Terminal Reality doesn't seem to understand that the thrill of flight sims comes partly from the limitations of an airplane.  We simmers may appreciate a casual routine jaunt from Chicago to Gary, Indiana, but we also want to push these airplanes to the edge of the envelopes and beyond.  We like the thrill of coping with a malfunctioning system or a damaged airplane.  We want to know that if we fly these birds too hard, they might lose a wing and dive to the earth in a fatal spiral.  These are frail aircraft, not shielded X-Wings or UFOs.  But the aircraft in Fly! are indestructible, impervious to all damage and system failures.  Smack into the side of buildings with impunity.  Plow into a mountain and take right off again.  Slap your plane onto the runway with the descent rate of an Olympic shot-put and you won't be any the worse.  Terminal Reality claims they removed aircraft damage and systems failures to avoid conflicts with the manufacturers of the actual aircraft, but apparently Looking Glass, Sierra, and Microsoft didn't have this problem.  Just last night, I snapped the wing of a 172 Trainer while doing sharp turns over Flight Unlimited II's Full Moon Bay.  As far as I know, Looking Glass didn't get any angry calls from Cessna's lawyers as a result.  It's unfortunate that Fly! isn't more thoroughly documented for new players, because it does a good job of simplifying some of the complex business of navigation.  You can open overhead maps while in flight that let you click directly on a navigational aid to tune it to your radio.  Pop up windows provide full information on airports.  The planning map before an actual flight should be copied by other general aviation sims for its user-friendliness and aesthetic appeal.  The air traffic control procedures are more detailed and realistic than even the excellent Flight Unlimited II, but they don't have the same sense of excitement or immersion.  If you have a powerful enough computer to maintain a steady framerate, the flight model has a pleasant fluid feel.  And Fly!'s atmospheric effects, the clouds and lighting and weather, are the best you'll find so far.    Fly! isn't without its good points.  It just has too few of them.  It wouldn't be so bad to come in fourth place among general aviation sims if there were more than four sims available.  But right now, Fly!, which is in last place, is something of an unpleasant belly flop.  -- Lszl Almsy", "date": "Oct 6, 1999"}
