For a time, my gaming experience virtually revolved around them. Lord knows I can get a tooth chattering kind of giddy at the sight of a kick ass puzzler, but Mystery of the Druids retains too few of the genuinely quality aspects of either, and exhibits too much in the way of slow, overly methodical pacing that often times revolves around nonsensical puzzles and chance encounters. Can't open the iron gate? Just use your paper folder, silly!  There are several easily distinguishable characteristics to games of these sorts that, if developed properly, cause a product to shine like the sun, but if neglected, can tarnish the game's luster to levels of such a degree of annoyance that they were previously reserved for the likes of Roseanne and that stupid morning radio talk show host whom feels obliged to solve all the problems of the world whilst eating a sandwich. To be successful in the adventure genre your product needs to build off of a compelling, well-developed fiction with intriguing, lively characters, and rest on laurels of well thought out puzzles logically and cleverly intertwined with said fiction. Mystery of the Druids fails at this.   If you find yourself accidentally skipping the game's opening CG intro, you'll come to realize this mystery starts rather abruptly, which, contrary to what you might think, works well actually. Play begins with a conversation between you and your boss. Just prior to this, players will be treated with one of quite a few brief clips of pre-rendered animation that intermingles with the bulk of the game. This first clip essentially conveys to the gamer that you are a detective with the Scotland Yard by the name of Brent Halligan. Pretty much a loser, disrespected by peers and shunned by the fairer sex, Brent is the sort of the odd man out in the agency. Though, it seems things may be changing for Halligan, as another more liked detective has fallen under a spell of bad luck, what sending an innocent man to jail who happens to subsequently go and get himself murdered and all. Suddenly you find yourself with the case of the mysterious skeleton murders. Where this mystery will take you who knows *cough* England, France, The Past *cough*... Whoo, spooky... Did I just give away a huge chunk of the story by telling you it would take you into the past? Damn straight I did, but then, you'd probably figure that on your own if you actually looked at the game, what with the words ~Past~ and ~Present~ stamped on two of the game's three CDs. You are with Scotland Yard by the way.  If there's one thing Mystery of the Druids gets right, it would be conversation and the underlying story. Your character and those that you meet are rich, distinct, well written for, and generally well acted. Halligan plays his part perfectly, clumsily searching about for his wallet, carrying on with bizarre, almost childish conversations, and just being Halligan, whom you'll actually come to associate with and care for.  Primarily conversational-centric gameplay on which this title is for the most part based would then assumedly be more than welcome, especially considering virtually every single piece of text in the game is recorded in the spoken word. Unfortunately, what good parts there are come across severely hampered by unnecessarily long rambles where characters drone on for what seems like for-freaking-ever. There'll come times when it seems as if every piece of story-relevant material gets crammed into one monotonous kidney stone. Speaking to the cripple comes to mind (I don't remember his name because I don't care). That conversation seemed to last for coming up on a half an hour, maybe even longer. You know when someone entirely uninteresting chews on your ear for twenty minutes, all the while they go unheard as you stupidly nod in agreement pondering what beautiful babies you and the talented Charisma Carpenter could make? This is the same kind of, ~I have no idea what the hell he's talking about, and even if I did remotely care, I'd still just say, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh just to get him to shut the hell up quicker. Suddenly other PC Editors Steve Butts and Dan Adams are reflecting upon every conversation they've ever had with me. And rightfully so, for the next time they prattle on, I may have to get all Druid on their asses and bore them to death right back.  I don't care if you're one big fat, giant freaking walking ear lobe with feet...It gets tiresome. And much like Math class before it, you'll inevitably find yourself dozing off halfway through wishing you had saved a few dozen belts of scotch instead of downing it all on the school bus. Only this time there's no obnoxious teacher to shake you out of your slumber... ~No Mr. Smith, I swear I'm not drunk. I only smell like whiskey because my dad's an abusive alcoholic.~  The poo pile only grows once the fact that a lot of conversations must be repeated two, three, or fifty times are factored in. Chosen responses dictate how the character which you are conversing with will react to you. Unfortunately, often times a very specific reaction is required for progression. It's then up to you to repeatedly engage in these redundant conversations, every time picking a different path of responses so that you can ultimately end up at the goal of the stupid chemist giving you a drink of some of his Ethanol. This would be painfully tedious had not there been a forgiving skip ability implemented (press the escape key to skip through any text, and keep pressing it to leave a conversation when the options to respond are displayed).  But why talk to these people at all? It's kind of required. It's through talking to them that you learn what your next task will be; sadly an aspect of gameplay where Mystery of the Druids falls considerably short. The tasks that adventure games so heavily rely upon for enjoyment are so illogically and inexplicably implemented that they'll at times result in uncontrollable bouts of boredom, and an aggravating frustration that you'd think only watching back-to-back Punky Brewster and Blossom could bring. Why the only pair of scissors in all of Scotland Yard is in your arch nemesis's office, and how you'd ever think use a piece of paper to open an iron gate are so far beyond me it's not even funny.  I understand completely that the brunt of quest games are made of these types of puzzles. Let us not forget I was raised on Kings Quest, Space Quest, Star Trek 25th Anniversary, a few Indiana Jones titles and Leisure Suit Larry, among others. But in a day when actual intelligence and workable problems based out of solvable common sense equations are finally being realized by the Project Eden's of the world, is it really necessary for us to be devolved back into the era where the only way to solve a problem is to try absolutely every course of action without any thought whatsoever? I find that simply unacceptable.  There's also not really that many of things to do. If you go back knowing what to do, you could beat the game in half a day. Longevity comes in figuring out what course of action to take as each situation arises. But because a lot of it amounts to running back and forth, trying every single item you have on every single thing in sight, and just repeatedly talking to everyone again and again, the length stretches out considerably (and not in a good Tantric kind of way, mind you).   Dragging the mouse over the entire screen in a side-to-side search patter, trying to figure out what might be of use sucks butt. But it wouldn't be so bad, if only the things that the cursor indicated were available for use were actually able to be used, but as it turns out, about 75% of the crap you run across serves no purpose but to waste your time. There will come a point when some of it will suddenly become useful (for no more then one task), but for the most part it's all just garbage that only pretends to serve some purpose (i.e. Niki the intern).   But if anything, it's always got the graphics to fall back on! I mean, good thing this game looks like the original Resident Evil otherwise... Oh wait, I forgot that looking like a six-year-old game that runs on a system whose graphical and processing capabilities are now the equivalent of today's high-end toaster market isn't considered good.   The backgrounds are for the most part static and uninspired, if at times technically well drawn, and the 3D models are fairly sloppy. Blend in a healthy dose of just plain goofy bugs and you've got yourself a wicked margarita mix (1 part gasoline, 1 part ketchup, 2 parts Meow Mix -- add salt, serve chilled). On a GeForce 3 with the latest official Detonator series of drivers the game had a terrible time of rendering the polygonal characters without clipping them into and above the static backgrounds. If you can imagine the background as a flat picture without any of the dimension its intended to have, and then place characters atop this, you'll get the idea... Like people walking in front of a blue screen. It's not supposed to be like this. People aren't supposed to walk right on top of tables and the like, but the fact that it's present on one of the most popular series of graphics cards and drivers around is just plain uncool. Their solution to the problem? Turn off hardware acceleration and run the game in software... Lame.  All the tedium, boredom, monotony, redundancy, and erratic design are exponentially worsened by the game's loading time. Every time you see a magnifying glass you can zoom in, which takes about five seconds (and is pretty much required for every character met). Every time you move from one screen to the next you must also ride out this five-second wait between scenes. Five seconds sounds like a small price to pay, but lets do a little arithmetic for the sake of argument, shall we? Five seconds to talk to a character, five seconds to leave a character, five seconds to enter any room. I think it's a fair guess that a fourth of total play time will be spent waiting. That amounts to a about a billion hours in Ivan ADD time.  As I said before, the story and characters are where the game shines, but in the end that's simply not enough to drag the rest of it out of the dreaded Druid pit (think sweaty, hairy-backed cloaked guys, and a lot of urine). Despite how much I'd like to see a revival of the point and click, I can't, in good conscious, recommend the title to anyone but the absolute most die-hard fanatic.  Are we simply outgrowing the genre? Do the newer Deus Ex's, System Shock 2's, Thief's, strategy titles, and logical puzzlers like Project Eden simply dwarf and spoil the dated play mechanics of the point-and-click? I don't really think so, because I figure I could have really enjoyed this game had it not so feloniously blowed in so many ways (crushing whatever life it may have had).  This is one mystery better left unsolved.  -- Ivan ~Hates me some filthy Druids~ Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
