SEGA spotted this trend years ago with dual penguin-themed games. The first, Penguin Luv has been on headsets for some time, but the arcade smash Pengo is finally debuting on the nation's largest carrier: Verizon.  Features:  Port of 1982 arcade hit Accurate penguin sim Difficulty settings  Pengo, the penguin with a plan, is back in action after a long time out in the cold. It's a classic twitch game where you must maneuver through a maze of ice blocks, avoiding direct contact with the nasty Sno-bees. Seems these arctic denizens have a mad-on for Pengo, and the only way to cool them off is by smashing them between ice blocks.  But Pengo is about more than squishing Sno-bees. There are several diamond ice blocks in each level, and should Pengo line these up before time runs out or the Sno-bees have been out in deep freeze, his score will skyrocket.  And really, that's about al there is to it. Which is why it's so darn fun. Pengo is an arcade classic with basic game play, and it translates wonderfully to the cellphone. The Reagan-era graphics make the jump just fine. Too bad the retro-cool theme didn't quite make the hop.  Control is not an issue, either, thanks to the simple up-down-left-right set-up. The only action button you need is the ~5,~ which pushes ice blocks.Pengo has long been one of my favorite games -- it was an arcade fave and it spent a great many hours in my old Atari 5200. (Which, I think I may drag out after I finish this update.) Since I had such an affinity for the penguin, my hopes were sky high that SEGA Mobile wouldn't blow it. They delivered. Pengo is a sweet actioner that will devour your down time, like a polar bear with a Coke.", "date": "Feb 13, 2004"}
