Nascar 99 features 31 of the top drivers in the league, including Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace, Michael Waltrip and Dick Trickle. It also highlights races on 17 official NASCAR tracks in Atlanta, California, Charlotte, and more.  One of the more unique, and very EA Sports-esque, features is the running commentary during a given race. TV-style race color is provided by Benny Parsons and Bob Jenkins, giving necessary updates like field updates, track and driver facts, and opinions of the race in progress.  It wouldn't be a NASCAR game without the ability to adjust your car's features, and NASCAR 99 has a very elaborate garage to fine-tune your car's performance. Wedge, downforce, gear ratios, tires, fuel load, wheel lock, shocks, and car weight distribution can all be tweaked to milk the most out of your vehicle. If you're not really into the simulation part of NASCAR, you can easily jump in and play in the arcade mode where you don't need to focus on all the intricacies of the sport  bang up those cars...they can really take a beating.  There's also a splitscreen mode for two player races against up to six computer drones, but in single player races you can challenge a full load of 23 other opponents. This game is obviously tailored for fans of NASCAR and fans of NASCAR only. This game is chock full of player stats, cars, and historical situations that will definitely make fans of the series drool. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those fans.NASCAR racing is all about tweaking your car, and seeing how well it performs on each of the different tracks. For generic racing fans like myself, though, this game is dreadfully dull. It's way too simulation-oriented, and there's really no sense of speed. If this is how NASCAR truly is, then I don't want any part of it. The graphics are also nothing to write home about, utilizing a graphics engine that doesn't really show off any of the system's strengths. The game does utilize the Dual Shock controller well, especially when offering force-feedback during bumps and nudges, but the game itself is just not my cup of tea. Give me Gran Turismo or Need for Speed 3 any day.", "date": "Oct 1, 1998"}
