Wait, scratch that. Where are the good RPGs? Between last November and now, the only title even worth playing was Sting's Evolution, which was solid, if unremarkable. The only hope I had of any decent gaming until the interminably delayed Shenmue was Climax Landers. On the one hand, the results when it was first shown off at the initial Dreamcast unveiling were positive -- it looked better than any of the other RPGs shown. Considering it was being produced by the same company that produced Landstalker for the Genesis and Dark Savior for the Saturn, hope were high. On the other, numerous delays and reports of programming problems led me to believe it could end up as yet another in a long series of promising but unfinished games. Guess which one it was? In the extra months of development time, Climax has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and come up with something playable but highly flawed. Landers starts out ambitious enough. You are Sword, a roving adventurer of the benign sort, caught up in a time warp that transports you to a mysterious floating world where pieces of various worlds and times have stuck together like so many soap bubbles. You're hailed as a great hero who can solve the mystery of this great purgatory and return everyone to their appropriate eras. Fair enough. Given that it's an RPG, I can forgive the fact that the scientists on board the starship Enterprise knockoff can't solve the problem but you can. As you go about searching the dungeons and go on quests, you'll meet five more playable characters, who join your group. Each one will have certain special abilities that round out your party -- these fall into familiar categories. Rao is the strong, slow guy. Ryle is fast. Marlin is the magic user, and so on and so forth.   It's a standard RPG setting, but the world itself looks good, even after all this time. Since the world is basically a giant jigsaw puzzle, there's no reason one piece has to look like the other and Climax has in turn created individual looks for each area. Norman's world is a giant turtle, while Z33 Colony looks like a futuristic spacecraft, complete with robotic birds and chain smoking scientists. As you complete more main quests, new pieces fall into place, including my favorite, a chunk out of a modern Japanese suburb, complete with supermarket and restaurant. It's got a Time Bandits meets the Bermuda Triangle look that really works for it. Unfortunately, in this main world, Climax has subscribed to the Blue Stinger school of camera control and created a drunken computer cameraman who likes to swoop in large erratic circles as you move around. Very annoying when trying to move around. You get used to it, but it's never pretty. The cameras are better in-dungeon, but your POV choices are limited.  Once you're in the game, Landers pace follows Evolution very closely. Explore a dungeon, get a short plot point, meet up with a new player character, go into a new dungeon. Between plot-oriented dungeons, you can hit Norman the rabbit guy up for mini-quests, where you get additional skills and cash for completing various objectives. We're talking RPG at its most basic, which would be boring, if the dungeon exploring wasn't so good.  The whole exploration segment of Landers is the only thing that feels complete. You've got an excellent automap with a wide variety of options. In addition to your normal stats, you have ability points, which you can use to search the dungeon for traps, additional items, and hidden monsters. Other acquired skills give you initiative boosts and damage bonus, which all draw from the same ability point pool, which makes you plan strategies for keeping your abilities for later floors. Major features, like visible monsters and the ability to capture said monsters to use as party members really update this genre for the 90s. Minor features, like enhancing your stats and ability dependent items round out your equipment strategy. Sure, it's still just you running around in randomly-generated dungeons to find and kill the boss, but it's really well done.  So what's wrong with this game? Plenty. There are many quirks to this game that may work well in theory which, in practice, bite the big one. Even though you've got six playable characters, you can only play one at a time. There's no way to get them together, and you've got to wonder why the heck you needed them in the first place, since you can use any character in any dungeon.  Secondly, every time you enter a dungeon, you start at level one. That means all the experience and all the magic you fought and bled for in the volcano dungeon, for example, is now gone, and you've got a measly 20 hit points, limited item capacity, and no continuity. It's incredibly disappointing to see your 25th level Sword go back to level 1 after beating the hardest boss in your life. Also, once you get out of the dungeon, all your items are effectively useless, since you're automatically healed, your unknown items automatically identified, and all your magic spells vanish. The only thing you need to do outside is to sell off your items and save the game, since you're limited to 4-6 items going in. It doesn't feel like you're getting anywhere in the game.  Worst of all, even if you know only rudimentary Japanese, you can go from opening to ending credits in less than 10 hours. Since you don't gain experience points, there aren't that many items to get, and there isn't any puzzle solving, it's a totally mindless quest to finish the dungeons, fight the boss, and go home. If you've got four firing neurons and working hands, you can finish Landers in less time than it takes to finish Sonic Adventure. Sure, you can take the side quests and play the VMU games to stretch it out, but they're only delaying actions.  If you've got to have an RPG, play Evolution. If you've already played it and you've got to have another game, play Landers. Otherwise, six months down the line, you'll see the first great Dreamcast RPGs arriving and it'll be worth the wait.  -- Jeff Chen, IGN Sci-Fi", "date": "Oct 13, 1999"}
