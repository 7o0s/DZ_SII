Needless to say, when we found out this sequel to the sublime Sonic Rush seemed to jettison the original's finely honed high-speed platform purity in favour of the kind shambolic excess that's dragged Sonic's 3D outings down into the pits of unspeakable horror, we were apprehensive to say the least.   What's more, your first ten minutes with the game subjects you to such a rollercoaster of elation and crushing disappointment - kicking any giddy joy you might have gleaned from the deliriously catchy intro straight out with a mindlessly rambling cut-scene featuring one of the most annoying characters ever to grace the Sonic universe - it's tempting to rip the cart straight out of your DS and pretend it never existed, just to be on the safe side.     Bear with it though - as it turns out, Sonic Rush Adventure is every bit as good as its predecessor, if not a tiny bit more. It's just that it's structurally a whole lot weirder too. After a fairly redundant tutorial, your first task is to cobble together a water bike. That is, of course, after several more reams of blathering from the cast - all this exposition presumably contributing to the 'Adventure' portion of the title. For the next ten minutes or so, you'll learn how to plot a chart across the world map and speed over the waves on the aforementioned vessel. It's distinctly un-Sonic-y and you'll probably wonder when you're going to finally get the chance to do some, you know, running around.   Thankfully though, the game does get there eventually. Like Sonic Rush Adventure though, we're going to make you wait a bit before we get to that. First: boating! As you progress through the game, you'll piece together four different vehicle types - water bike, sailboat, hovercraft and submarine - all of which enable you to reach various bits of the world map by utilising their unique attributes. The water bike, for instance, is nippy but doesn't get you very far; the submarine flounders in the shallows but dives beneath the waves and the hovercraft is awesome for taking down enemy vessels but tends to be a bit precarious in choppy water. Then there's the sailboat which too struggles in shallows but goes on for bloody ages. Before you jump into each, you plot your route with the stylus on the world map and - assuming your craft can cross the terrain safely - you'll hop in for a short but perfectly formed stylus-based mini-game, generated on the fly according to your route of choice.     During water bike sections, you steer by dragging the boat left or right and initiate a speed boost by double-tapping. It all feels a lot like the 3D half-pipe Chaos Emerald dashes in Sonic Rush and you'll find yourself dodging oncoming enemies and swishing your stylus at onscreen prompts to perform tricks off ramps - all lavishly displayed using the game's silky smooth 3D engine. It's a ton fun, as are the Space Harrier-like hovercraft sections. Still hurtling into the screen, you steer as before but tap your vessel to fire energy bolts at oncoming foes, holding down for bigger blasts and swooshing the stylus for bullet-deflecting spin-attacks. Then there're the submarine sections which are, to all intents and purposely, Elite Beat Agents without the music. In fact, the only misstep is the target-and-tap galleon game which, while not actually bad, is nowhere near as tightly constructed or addictive as its brethren.   It's a good job all this stuff's fun too because you'll be doing rather a lot of it - mainly when tracking down islands on the world map - some of which are integral to the story, others making up the surprisingly large roster of 'secret' islands: short but infuriatingly challenging mini-levels which, in a spirited move, feature barrel-throwing monkeys. Whether it's these 'lite' challenges or the real deal, Sonic Rush's excellent level design and hair-raising speeds are back in full force for this sequel. As you journey from island to island, progression involves conquering two themed platform sections then a boss - all of which are uniformly impressive. If you've played Rush, you'll know what to expect here and everything - from the more speed-focused level layout to trick combo system and Tension Gauge - makes a welcome return.     Additions include jump dashes and hop jumps which prove invaluable for rectifying potentially deadly errors of judgement. Notably, Rush's infuriating procession of blind jumps and impossible-to-avoid sudden death sequences have been all but entirely obliterated, making for an easier but far, far less frustrating game. That said, there are plenty of levels to get through - all of which sport a kind of alternate-reality take on traditional Sonic stage fodder - and enough multiple routes to make speedsters jump for joy as they attempt to whittle down their times, second by second. Here's a tip though if you're finding things a bit too undemanding: for some reason, the game defaults to easy bosses - check the options menu to toughen them up and, for more of a challenge, you can enable time limits on all levels too.   At the end of each platform segment, you're awarded a quantity of a certain material type, depending on your performance and final grade. These are important as Tails uses materials to build your boat roster, enabling access to more distant islands in the game. Admittedly, when we first came across this mechanic, we were fearful we'd be subjected to endless retreads of the same levels again and again. However, somehow, it works - partly because levels are just plain entertaining and partly because it forces you to hone your skills ready for time trials, online play and missions later. Thankfully, the game keeps required material amounts sensible and makes proceedings painless by enabling instant access to any level once completed.    It's this kind of thought that makes Sonic Rush Adventure shine and, by really polishing each individual aspect of the game, Sonic Team's managed to ensure that, despite its many nautical tangents, everything feels fun. And believe us: there's an absolute ton to keep you entertained here. Alongside main story progression, you can visit merchants to trade rings for flags, statues and other pointless trimmings for your base island and test your mettle in mission mode, featuring 100 challenges ranging from collecting rings within the time limit to performing a set number of trick combos. Not only do these offer a genuinely tough challenge, you're rewarded with all manner of bonuses for completing them, including an incredibly welcome sound test option for revelling in the absolutely brilliant soundtrack. Add in Blaze's quest to collect the seven Sol Emeralds, water bike races with Chaos Emeralds as prizes and, of course, online multiplayer and leader board options and the amount of content is simply dizzying. Best of all though, it all feels fleshed out, amounting to far more than just filler.     As for online and multi-cart multiplayer, you can either go head-to-head in a race to the finish line over any of the game's levels or try and grab the most rings within the time limit, using special power-ups to usurp your foe. Truthfully, neither of these is exactly revelatory but they're undoubtedly fun. Perhaps more interesting though is the game's leader board which lets you upload your best time trial scores to Sonic Rush Adventure's official website for public perusal. If some of the times we've seen up there already are anything to go by, you'll be glad you had practise time during story mode. Needless to say, learning the quickest routes through levels or the best moments to unleash super boosts and trick combos fast becomes an obsession - the more you play, the more you'll realise how much depth there is hidden inside the little blue hedgehog's shoes.In all honesty, its hard to find fault with Sonic Teams latest DS endeavour aside from the obvious one  its new Sonic meaning an emphasis on speed rather than traditional platforming acrobatics, which won't be for everyone. Beyond that, purists might take umbridge at the entertaining but superfluous additions which do tend to get in the way if youre just here for the side-scrolling speed thrills. That aside though, there's an wealth of content to get your teeth into and there's barely a wobbly moment in sight. Who said this hedgehog was on his last legs?", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
