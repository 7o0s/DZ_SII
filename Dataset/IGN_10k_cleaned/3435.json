Since then, the game has become one of the most popular PC games on the market with nearly half a million subscribers and thousands upon thousands of players in the game at any one time.   (IGN Insiders: Get a more detailed look at EverQuest Online Adventures in this video review.)   With the PlayStation 2 headed online, it was only a matter of time before the hugely successful franchise would make the leap from PC to console; and now it has. Instead of being a sloppy port of the PC original (which wouldn't really adapt well to a console), EverQuest Online Adventures is a whole new game built from the ground up for the PlayStation 2. Taking the core idea of EverQuest, the developers streamlined it and simplified things to make it easily accessible, yet just as addicting as the original game. The result is a faithful console representation of the game that owns the lives of thousands of gamers, that just so happens to improve upon some of the larger gameplay issues of its big PC brother.   Story  To be perfectly honest with you, there isn't a story in EverQuest Online Adventures; at least not in the way that you'd expect. The way that EQ as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game works, is that it puts players in the fantasy world of Norrath where they create their own legends through the adventures that they embark on alone or with friends. Class-specific quests in the game follow a story that players experience as they complete the various tasks given to them by NPCs (non-player characters).   That being said, there is a lot of lore behind the game and its setting. The Norrath of EQOA is set roughly five hundred years before the time of the PC game. To bring you up to speed, the current world of EQ features five continents (Odus, Antonica, Faydwer, Kunark, and Velious), a moon known as Luclin, and multiple alternate planes of existence. In the time period of EQOA, Antonica is the only continent initially available to players, and it's named Tunaria here as the Elves have only begun to leave the continent to find Faydwer.    Players that are familiar with the PC world will find many areas in EQOA that are very familiar, yet vary different. A popular dungeon from the original game, Befallen, is here, but it's a living breathing ~city~ of sorts that's very friendly to those who aren't evil. There are also dragons present such as the ~oldie, but goodie~ Lady Vox, as well as her lair Permafrost. And there are even whispers of some God encounters that the most experienced players may find in their adventures.    In this time period, all of the core races are living together on the continent of Tunaria. The Elves haven't yet split into High Elves and Wood Elves, the Erudites have not yet made their journey to the continent of Odus, and the Ogres are living in an exile of sorts in their mountain fortress of Ogguk (which is why they aren't a playable race yet). Popular races from the PC such as the Iksar and Vah Shir aren't in the game, as they weren't discovered until the time period of the original.    With the game being a prequel, it also ties in with upcoming expansions for the PC game. Players in EQOA can explore Broken Skull rock, which is a zone with some conflict going on that ties in with the next PC expansion, The Legacy of Ykesha. Also, EQ PC players can go to the Plane of Knowledge and read books in the library, which contain information on the events of the world in EQOA. The connections between the two games go much deeper than just the name.    Gameplay  EverQuest Online Adventures is an online RPG set in a persistent world. That means when a player logs out, the world and players continue on. Unlike the other console online RPG that most of you are pretty familiar with, Phantasy Star Online, the game world is completely free form and players can go wherever they want, whenever they want. You know how in PSO players must trudge through the Forest, to unlock the Mines, etc.? It works a bit different in EQ. You don't have to ~unlock~ areas by completing one; rather you can walk right into a dungeon - as long as you are strong enough to survive. It's a huge seamless world open for exploration. Players basically can do what they want in the world of Norrath as they build up a reputation and form friendships while adventuring across the 500+ mile world.    In EQOA players are able to choose from ten races and fourteen classes to make just about whatever type of character they desire. The races are: Human - Western, Human - Eastern, Elf, Dark Elf, Barbarian, Halfling, Gnome, Erudite, Dwarf, and Troll. For classes, you can choose from Bard, Cleric, Enchanter, Necromancer, Magician, Wizard, Druid, Shaman, Shadow Knight, Paladin, Monk, Rogue, Ranger, and Warrior. Whew.     But, that's not the end of it. Races are limited to what classes they are able to play. For example, Trolls aren't the brightest things around so they can only be Shaman, Shadow Knights, and Warriors. On the other side of things, Western Humans are able to play as any class except for Necromancer, Shadow Knight, and Shaman. Then, some races are better suited to some things than others. The big and dumb Trolls make great warriors (or ~tanks~), while the small and intelligent Gnomes lean more towards the magic (or ~caster~) classes.   Once a race and class is chosen, bonus attribute points need to be assigned. Each character is made up of seven attributes: Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. At character creation, players have twenty bonus points to assign across all seven attributes however they want, although the game lends a helping hand by highlighting the two most important attributes for that class.   Those important attributes aren't the only thing you'll want to think about, however. Certain abilities receive a bonus depending on that character's score in a specific stat. For example, a Wizard with high dexterity may get a damage bonus on certain spells. Players also aren't stuck with what points they assign at creation, as the character will receive additional ability points to spend as he or she levels up through the game. These points are received all the way to level 50 (the highest in the game), so they can tweak their character as they grow.    Once you choose your character's appearance (by selecting the face, hair style/color, etc.) it's time to play EQOA, and the game actually gives newbies quite a bit of a helping hand at the beginning. As soon as a player logs into the world for the first time, a welcome message appears and offers an explanation of the interface and controls. Also, the first couple of class quests teach a player some of the basics of the game such as how to use the Spiritmasters (they mark a location for the character to reappear after they die), and how to use the coachmen at the stables to quickly go between different areas. Also, when a character ventures out of their starting city for the first time, the game will offer a small combat tutorial to new players.   Those early moments of a character's life are just small examples of how EQOA was tooled to be easy to get into. The biggest change from the PC original to the console is how the developers simplified and streamlined the gameplay, which also solved some ~problems~ with the PC game.   One of the biggest changes is the Ability system. This combines the Skills and Spells from the PC game into one area that works about the same across all casters. Gone is ~Mana~ from EQ, as it's replaced with ~power~, but it works about the same. Once a player learns a new ability (either by buying a scroll or receiving one via a quest), they must expend a little bit of power each time they use that skill. The amount varies from ability to ability, but it doesn't matter if you cast a spell or use a special melee attack - they all depend on your character's power. Once your power is depleted, you need to wait for it to refill, or you can chug a few drinks to quickly replenish it.    These Abilities are located on a ~belt~ at the top corner of the screen and you use up or down on the D-Pad to scroll through the ones you have memorized. Drinks (and food to replenish your hit points) are stored on a tool belt in the same section of the screen. To access them, a player simply hits left or right on the D-Pad to cycle through the Ability belt and the tool belt. Pressing Circle instantly uses the highlighted Ability or item. Being able to use Food to replenish your HP and Drinks to replenish you Power really helps eliminate the down time that plagued the PC version.    The Ability system removes some headaches from the PC game, as players don't have to worry about keeping a specific skill high. You don't have to go out and repeatedly use a skill to make it good here, that element of worry isn't present.    That theme of less worry runs through most of the gameplay elements of EQOA. Players don't have to worry about finding their corpse when they die - there aren't player corpses in the game. They also don't have to worry about losing experience when they fall in battle, as the game has an experience debt system. When a player dies, they incur an experience debt where half of the experience they earn will go towards the debt until it's paid off. Even if you die three or four times in a row, it doesn't take long at all to pay off the debt, especially if you fight monsters close to your level. This is one of the biggest improvements in EQOA over its big brother on the PC, where players can easily lose a level they just gained by dying just once.    Where the game will sting you, however, is through item decay. As you fight, your weapons and items will take damage, and they'll need to be repaired by a blacksmith in town. This costs Tunar (the in-game currency that players get by fighting monsters and selling the loot) to do, and the higher level the weapon or armor is, the more Tunar it'll cost to repair.    That's right, items have a level assigned to them in EverQuest Online Adventures. This cuts down on the aspect of ~Twinking~, where a high-level character will create a new character and give them very good items. In EQOA, each item has a minimum level requirement that a character must reach before it could be used. This makes things a bit fairer for new players who may start playing a few months down the line, as well as those players who decide to create multiple characters on their server (they can have up to eight per server).    Characters gain levels and experience through fighting creatures, and with the world being so vast there are naturally many different things for players to kill. When a creature, player, or NPC is targeted (with the R1 button), it's highlighted by a color circle that shows how strong it is in comparison to the character. A green circle means it's a easy kill that won't reward any experience, light blue means that it is slightly harder but will give a little experience, blue is usually the ideal target for a player to get experience safely, white means the target is about even to the player but can still be tough, yellow signifies a target a couple levels higher than the player and is quite risky, while red means that you'll probably die if you tried to kill it alone.   Level progression works on a curve, that naturally gets harder the higher you get. Players could usually breeze through their first five levels just by doing the initial class quests, and they can easily reach level 10 in just a couple hours of play. Also, players can level simply by questing, and since there aren't skills to maintain, it doesn't have much of a negative affect on the character. However, players will get to a point in the higher-end of the level spectrum where questing simply won't deliver as much experience as regular combat, so you'll still want the mix things up a bit.     Combat in EQOA is a bit more ~console-style~ than the PC game where you'd just turn on auto attack once an enemy was targeted. Here, a player targets an enemy, runs up to them and taps the X button to begin attacking. Now, you can either hold down the X button or tap it to attack, although keeping the button pressed makes it a bit tricky to quickly use an ability as those are triggered by the Circle button. So an experienced player would tap the X button to attack, while quickly hitting Circle from time to time to cast an ability (such as a spell or special melee attack). Also, the timing of Abilities becomes extremely important in high-level combat for both melee and caster types.   The extensive, and deep, faction system from the original game has been carried over here, but once again it is a little easier to use. When a player targets someone, there will be a little face next to his or her life bar in the lower corner of the screen. A blue face means they are amiable to the character, white means neutral, while a red faced target will attack you if you get too close to it. Players can improve their faction with most cities by hunting creatures that give positive faction, among other ways.    Naturally, there are countless quests in the game, including class-specific ones that a character can follow throughout their life beginning a level 1. These can include simply fetching an item from a slain enemy, or doing more specific tasks. There are also ~pick up~ quests that anyone can do simply by targeting the correct NPC and pressing Square to interact with them. When players get into their early 30's they can begin working on their ~Epic Quests~. These are the coolest of the cool, while also being the most difficult quests in the game, which require people to group (and work together) to complete and will require players to work on them all the way up to level 50. The rewards include very cool unique weapons as well as possibly unique Abilities that can only be received through these Epic Quests.    Groups in EQOA are limited to four players, and a person can group with someone up to six levels higher or lower than themselves and still get experience. Large groups of players can form guilds to assist in communication across the world as well as represent themselves as a group. If you have some friends in the game and want to form a guild, it will only cost 5000 Tunar to create it.    In addition to guilds, there is a wide range of community functions built into the game. There's a menu dedicated to these functions, and in it players will find all of the guild and group options, be able to keep a buddy list, send instant messages or mail to another player, trade with someone else, and even ignore profanity or a player. Now, the ignore option is actually pretty handy. Say a player blocks a doorway and then walks away from his game, and you're trapped in the room. If you ignore that player, you'll be able to walk right through them.    The extensive menu system also features a Character screen where players are able to assign bonus points to their attributes as they level up in the game as well as see their resistances and other stats while also seeing what exactly is modifying a stat such as a spell or an item. There's also a handy quest log that keeps tracks of the quests that you're currently working on.   Aside from the various gameplay changes that happened when bringing the world of Norrath to the PS2, another big change from the PC game is the elimination of ~zones~. In the original, players would have to stop and load from time to time when a new unique area was loading. EQOA features a huge seamless world and you'll never see a loading screen unless you're being quickly transported from one location to another (such as when you die or use an Ability that returns you to your home point).    The only real drawback to the seamless world, that a few players may not like, is that the Bard's speed song will always be the same speed as the ~Spirit of the Wolf~ spell. In the PC game, the Bard's song got faster and faster as the character increased in levels. The reason why the two Abilities are the same speed in this game is due to the way terrain information streams. Character speed needs to be carefully calculated, or else problems could arise as the player is running across the world.    I've mentioned specific controls from time to time in this review, but the game does play surprisingly well with the Dual Shock 2. They've done an excellent job designing the game around the controller. Movement in both first and third person view is handled with the left stick, while the right one looks around. Targeting is handled with the R1 and L1 triggers, and the game even uses the L3 and R3 stick buttons to toggle auto run and bring up the on-screen keyboard.   Speaking of the keyboard, you can choose to control the entire game with the Dual Shock 2, or you can use a USB keyboard or Logitech's NetPlay controller. Typing messages with a real keyboard is obviously much easier, so I'd recommend a USB keyboard although the game does include some pre-set chat sayings for the most common of situations.   The only complaint I have about the keyboard control is that you can't customize it. I personally prefer to use the ~WASD~ control scheme for EQ on the PC, and it'd be nice to do so on the console. As it stands right now, players need to use the Up/Down Left/Right buttons on the keyboard to move around. However, there is a chance that the game will be patched sometime in the future to allow keyboard customization.   That's another thing about MMORPG's that set them apart from other role-playing games. The game can be patched at any time to fix balancing issues that naturally pop up as new content is introduced into the game, as well as changing the aspects of certain areas such as what race controls a city or dungeon. Even though the game only uses 3000k on the memory card to patch information, it doesn't limit what can be done with the patches. The only thing using the Hard Drive would've done is given the developers the ability to change artwork in the game. Everything else can be patched to the memory card.     You see, with a MMORPG the world can change from week to week. So, the game you'll be playing next year will be a little different than what it is right now. Events happen all the time in these games, and with the game taking place 500 years before the original, players will probably see EQ history being played out in front of them.    The hook of EverQuest is exploring a vast world with other people, grouping to explore and fight through a dungeon, attaining cool items, and basically having a good time. EverQuest Online Adventures retains the same addictive core of the original game, while simplifying things and delivering a new experience to both console gamers and those who are veterans of the PC game.   If you're anti-social, or simply aren't into slow-paced RPGs, then EQOA definitely isn't for you. However, anyone who enjoys RPGs where they could do whatever you want (such as Morrowind), and likes the idea of getting together with a group of friends to explore a huge game world, would probably become hopeless addicts to EverQuest Online Adventures.    Graphics  Ok, lets face it; EQOA isn't the prettiest game in the world. The game features simplistic character models, low amounts to geometry, and some bland textures in places. However, this is all a necessary evil to keep the game running smooth while allowing a far view distance (go up to a hill and look around, you can see for about a mile or so) as well as a large number of players on-screen at once.   With servers supporting upwards of 3000 players, it's possible to see as upwards of a hundred at a time in a crowded area. Just running around the environment, the game tends to stay at a solid 30 fps. Occasionally in a crowded city it'll drop down to 25 or 20 fps for a second; mostly when the camera is spinning around.   Outdoor areas are the blandest, and are where the textures definitely won't impress. However, things tend to get a little better inside cities and dungeons where the texture work is a bit more detailed and even looks ~good~ at a distance. One dungeon, Tomb of the Kings, features some elaborate etching in the stone arches that guard its entrance as well as the domed ceiling that one finds towards the inner chamber of the dungeon.    You know, there were actually times when I paused and said ~wow this looks better than the old PC version~. EQ PC has recently gone through an engine upgrade that improved the textures, character models, and more with the Shadows of Luclin expansion. EQOA actually looks better than the pre-Luclin EQ in many ways. So, I loaded up the EQ Classic on one of the machines here at work (it came pre-installed on it), and I was right. The environments are less ~boxy~, character models are higher-poly, and even some of the textures (again mostly inside cities and dungeons) are better.    Most surprising is that some of the creature models are actually better than their PC counterparts. From small critters such as bats, beetles, and rats to larger ~mobs~ most notably the Griffons and Dragons, a majority of the creature models in EQOA are higher poly and more detailed than the same creature in the PC version. Then again, the old EQ graphics engine is more than five years old.    Another difference to the PC version comes in the game's sense of scale. Landmarks that were just a small foothill in the original are now mountains that stretch to the sky, and even some starting cities (such as the Human Druid and Ranger town Surefall Glade, or the Troll city of Grobb) are larger than their PC counterparts.   Weather and sky effects are also a bit better. Players will occasionally see a shooting star in the night sky, and thunderstorms look especially cool. Instead of lightning just being a white flash on the screen like in the original game, here the flash is more localized in the gray clouds and is accompanied by a very cool rumbling thunder sound effect. Still, the fact remains that the game can be rather bland looking most of the time, but it isn't completely horrible.     Sound  Unfortunately, the sound in EQOA is pretty sparse. The opening FMV credit sequence features the familiar EverQuest theme, and each race has its own little tune that players will hear during character creation and selection, but other than that there isn't really much music in the game.   Sound effects consist mostly of grunts and clangs during combat, however there are plenty of ambient sounds depending on the area that you're in. For example, Innothule Swamp features the chirping of crickets and the croak of frogs as you run through its mist. Spells also feature sound effects, but most of them sound pretty similar.    Other Stuff  This is also the first game on the US PS2 to feature monthly fees to play. The first month is free, and then it's $9.99 a month with multiple pricing options (3 months, 6 months or, 12 months). You can pay either with a credit card or pre-paid game card. This fee goes towards maintaining the game servers as well as paying the employees that create the in-game content that keeps the world changing. Unlike regular games, the work on a MMORPG doesn't stop when it hits stores.   The game fully supports narrowband and broadband connections, and is definitely narrowband friendly - with very little lag noticed on the slower connection. The only real drawback to playing the game over dial-up is that it can take a little while to download the patches.I've played EverQuest on the PC since the earliest days of Beta, and still actively participate in it. After the same process with the console version and seeing it in its finished form, I'm definitely going to be playing EverQuest Online Adventures for quite some time as well.Along with simplified gameplay that fixes many problems from the PC original, EQOA features the same sense of exploration and community that hooked me to begin with. And a player of the PC game, it's great to see areas that I know well that now look very different, yet in some ways familiar. It's also pretty cool to be able to enjoy it with a new community of players.With free content and new expansions in the works, the world of Norrath looks to thrive on the PS2 in the same way it did on the PC.", "date": "Feb 11, 2003"}
