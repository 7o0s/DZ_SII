Following the first Duke Nukem last year and the recently-released Duke Nukem Mobile 3D, Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project brings back one of the toughest hombres in vids for a repeat performance that will surely entertain fans of his rock-'em-sock-'em style of action.   Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project continues the same style of play from previous editions -- the Duke sprays every scene with lead while searching out yet another keycard to unlock the next area in this fifteen-level game. Sometimes, mobile actioners get dull thanks to repetitious mechanics (laying on ~OK~ for thirty minutes), but Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project employs a few tricks to keep things on this side of rote. For example, the Duke now has access to a jetpack which grants him the ability to hover over traps. You cannot avoid enemies while int he jetpack, and you have to keep an eye on the fuel guage to make sure the Duke doesn't crash back to earth right over a pit.   The majority of Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project is spent ventilating pig cops and other alien ilk with the Duke's patented line of boom-boom. I liked the addition of the flame thrower to his death-dealing menagerie -- it's just the kind of weapon you know the Duke would cotton to having. You'll need to keep a steady stream of fire (and bullets) up to push back the menaces that constantly run at the Duke. The screens have a few planes, so you'll be moving up and down as well as left and right. You can step out of the way of most bullets by just sliding between planes, but if you aren't quick on the draw, sometimes the screen will fill with bullets and leave you nowhere to run.   Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project features improved graphics from the first mobile game. I tested it on an LG VX8000, and was really pleased to see some sharp sprites pop off the screen. The boss characters, which are pretty damn cool, are memorable. The game scrolls quite smoothly, with little blur. As you would expect with any game bearing the Duke's name, Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project includes some digitized quips.  Action gamers will likely get a lot of mileage out of Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project. I enjoyed it more than the 3D edition, mainly due to the spot-on control. The presentation is rock solid, such as the improved sprites and the digitized speech. While the game offers no radical departure from previous editions, Duke Nukem has never really been about anything more than shooting up alien scumbags and looking good for the ladies. And in that respect, Duke Nukem Mobile II: Bikini Project succeeds.", "date": "Oct 4, 2005"}
