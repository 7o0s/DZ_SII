It's one of the strange entries in the traditional Pac series, offering some pretty sizeable departures from the universally beloved Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. The ~super~ in Super Pac-Man comes from Pac's ability to grow enormous (and invincible) after eating a green super pellet. While giant, Pac can also chew through locked doors that guard fruit and other goodies, which stand in for regular pellets. Ghosts still roam the maze and can be eaten by Pac as usual.   The locked door system is usually what throws people off. It is a pretty big difference from other Pac-Man games. Eating certain keys unlock different doors in the maze, and as you progress higher in the levels, the unlocked doors occur farther away from their respective keys. Some keys only unlock one door in a chamber with multiple portals, leaving you to either seek out the other keys to open up the entire passage or risk going in and eating the fruit, hoping a ghost doesn't follow you.   In the early levels, you can actually plow through the entire maze by eating the four super power pellets at strategic intervals. In later levels, your ~big sessions~ get shorter and shorter, and you really have to be smart about collecting keys. Between several levels, you get bonus screens where you are giant the entire time and have to eat all of the fruit before the lock runs out. These levels take practice to master.   Namco added some extra goodies specific to the mobile edition, such as Enhanced Mode, which offers power-ups not found in the arcade game. Pac can pick up tiny icons floating in the mazes to help him out, such as freezing ghosts and creating a mirror image of Pac to confuse his spectral foes. The Enhanced Mode is a fine addition, but I definitely preferred just sticking to the regular game.  Personally, I am a huge Super Pac-Man fan. It is my fave in the series -- so much that I own a Super Pac arcade cabinet. This mobile edition is a pretty solid facsimile of the original (at least, it is on the Samsung Blade). The game runs just a little sluggish, but I may be hyper-sensitive to that and the slightly slower pace does help compensate for mobile controls. But as far as a classic arcade game port goes Super Pac is rock solid. If you're a Pac fan, download it.", "date": "May 18, 2006"}
