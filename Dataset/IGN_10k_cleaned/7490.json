After a decade of dormancy, Hudson is bringing Bonk back to the spotlight, and what better place to stage the first leg of his comeback tour than mobile?   Bonk's Return is a traditional side-scrolling platform game, just like the old Turbo adventures. Based loosely on the original game, but redone for mobile sensibilities -- screen size, control -- Bonk's Return offers well over two dozen stages of head-smashing action. Bonk's prime weapon is his enormous melon, which is so tough it can split wood. Dinosaurs and other prehistoric nasties crumple beneath its ample weight.   Bonk also has something of a temper. If he eats red meat -- which is distributed throughout the game -- he goes into a rage, enjoying temporary invincibility. The expression on angry Bonk's face is priceless, as he blows his top and turns beet red.   Fans of 16-bit platformers will find a lot to like in Bonk's Return. Hudson adheres to old school mechanics, with lots of running and jumping along ledges perched precarious over chasms, clouds, and spikes. Googly eyed enemies must be dispatched. Walls are scaled with Bonk's massive teeth. Staples like ice-, lava-, and forest-themed levels make an appearance, too.   Hudson has done a fantastic job with Bonk's visuals. The game manages to one-up the old Turbo original, thanks to excellent background art and cleaned up sprites. The animations are smooth. The use of color is also outstanding, harkening back to the days of gaming before publishers fell in love with grays and browns. The sound effects are decent, but pale in comparison to the original -- and because I still own a Turbo, I can honestly say I checked this.   Now, here's where I have to bring things back down to earth a little... Hudson did a good job fixing up level design for mobile. Elements now fit better in the vertically oriented screen. However, let's be honest, the controls aren't perfect. Diagonal jumps with either the thumb pad or the number pad are not an exact science, so you're going to have to practice the whole running-then-jumping thing. You will fall into gaps. You will lose lives and curse at Bonk.   However, there is a challenge mode where you can practice up on Bonk's maneuvers. These are standalone segments where you're put through the paces in a variety of trials. They're excellent for just getting used to the way Bonk moves, or as respite from the regular game.  Bonk's Return is a great comeback for the beloved caveman mascot, even if the game isn't perfect. Hudson nailed the character, his expressiveness, and level design. This is a throwback to classic 16-bit platforming, and to an old-schooler like me, it's a welcome bit of gaming. The controls are a little tough to get used to. I tested the game on an LG VX8100, and getting precision jumps can be something of an occasional headache. But if you like Bonk and crave 16-bit sensibilities, Bonk's Return is a solid nostalgia trip and a big step at ushering this character back into the mainstream.", "date": "Nov 1, 2006"}
