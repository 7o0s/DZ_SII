A distinctly busy time of year for us gaming journalist types, this four-month period between August and the end of December sees so many software releases it can be hard to keep up. With no less than 15 new titles scheduled for release in the next couple of weeks alone, it's likely that several of the lesser-known titles will be overlooked -- likely the biggest tragedy of this whole hectic phenomenon.   One would-be casualty this season is Metro 3D's newest racer, Smash Cars: A radio-controlled driving simulation that blends slightly humorous environments with over-the-top physics. And while the early buzz for Smash Cars wasn't exactly positive, we're happy to report that this barely-aware offering from Russian developer Creat Studio has actually managed to turn out pretty good.   Gameplay  Similar to the old PlayStation and Dreamcast videogame Re-Volt, Smash Cars allows players to control 13 different kinds of radio-controlled automobiles. Ranked in three categories (Stunt Ability, Acceleration, and Top Speed), each car can be used in a multitude of different modes. Quick Race, Championship, Stunt, and Special Mini-Games can all be explored at any time from the main menu, and your participation in each will earn you money to spend elsewhere. Of course, participating in races costs money too, so in the early part of the experience you'll have to choose your challenges wisely.   If you can fulfill a particular section's requirements, though, the money earned can be spent to upgrade the outfitting of your car. Tires, engines, and boosters can all be enhanced to improve track performance and there are no restrictions as to how many or which vehicles you can upgrade. This flexibility allows gamers to, in theory, customize the experience to their liking -- an attribute that's always welcome in any game regardless of its genre.    The real meat of Smash Cars, however, is the racing itself. Utilizing an exaggerated physics engine while moving at astonishingly fast speeds, Creat's little project is one of those cool exceptions that's easy to get into but hard to master. Though each car has the ability to jump, perform stunts, and activate a turbo boost, there's a whole lot more to winning than that. The stage design, for instance, is invariably complex with each of the 13 levels twisting and turning in numerous ways. Shortcuts, obstacles, and a furiously competitive A.I. keep you on your toes the whole way through.   And while we're on the subject of stages, they're definitely among the more imaginative in the genre. Locales such as Area 51, The Caribbean, and the Hawaiian islands are all meticulously laid out with specific themes and secrets to unlock. And while every track does have a definite route to follow in order to complete a lap, the combination of wacky shortcuts and constantly changing barriers prevent things from becoming too predictable. There are even a couple of stages that force you to turn around and go back the way you came in order to finish your initial lap -- a fetching surprise after a hard-earned lead.   Sadly Smash Cars has a couple of bothersome elements working against it as well. The tutorial mode, for example, takes an unexplainably long time to cycle through instructions and the goals for mission-based stages aren't very clear. Similarly, good portions of the racetracks require you to drive through again and again because of sudden shifts in the geography. So while we thoroughly enjoyed the layout of each stage, the hidden dips and crevices that sometimes follow the lap's main path result in crashed vehicles quite often.   Another hurtful factor is the cars themselves. Although Creat has included 13 different types with upgradeable parts, there's little difference between any of them in the early sections. Sure you can customize them to be different on your own, but why worry about such a thing if you're going to alter the car to fit your particular style of play anyway? And while we're on the subject of things that don't make sense, why is it that the digital pad is only capable of turning at certain times? For some unknown reason the pad stops functioning altogether in several instances. Luckily, the analog stick works the whole way through.    Graphics  Smash Car's sense of speed is easily the most impressive visual aspect of the game. On the same level as Acclaim's Burnout 2 in terms of this illusion, Smash's engine is super fast and a lot more complicated than it first lets on. Not only is it populated with an abundance of different obstacles and objects, it's also overflowing with activity. Up to six different cars can be on screen at any one time with giant human characters, automobiles, and weather effects animating simultaneously. All in all, it goes a long way towards convincing us that we're using real R/C cars in a living, breathing world.   Effective as the engine may be, it's still not without its problems. Environmental textures in particular are invariably washed out with a bleeding of colors that doesn't look natural at all. Player-controlled autos fare a little bit better in this respect, but they're plagued by a severe case of the jaggies. In fact, just about every object in the game is rife with aliasing problems and a profusion of simplistic, low-polygon structures. It's the price one pays for creating a huge, interactive world like this, but that's not to say that the trade-off isn't worth it; because it is.   Sound  Despite the fact that there's a moderate list of music tracks and a handful of sound effects, the audio in Smash Cars is nothing out of the ordinary. The score itself is a little hard to differentiate between tunes and doesn't offer a single track worth memorizing. And to be truthful, it reminded us of just about every other driving title we've played over the last 20 years. To call the soundtrack generic would be paying it a compliment.   The revving of engines, occasional vocal bits, and accompanying foley in the background is about on the same level as the music. But don't expect your speakers to leap out at you with some kind of thunderous result. Encoding is limited to standard stereo sound, and since most cars sound identical to one another, the lawn mower-like buzz of your opponents can get a little repetitive. Technical problems and limitations aside, Smash Cars' most important feature (being fun) still manages to glimmer pretty brightly. And while it may not win any awards for visuals, innovation, or course design (which we feel is its strongest attribute), that doesn't necessarily make it a bad game.Yes it has its flaws; but for speed junkies and hardcore racing fanatics looking for something to do between more serious experiences, Smash Cars is an enjoyable distraction. It's worth a test-drive at least.", "date": "Aug 22, 2003"}
