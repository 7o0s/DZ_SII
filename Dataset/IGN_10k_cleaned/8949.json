The few surviving, hoverboard-riding citizens of the apocalyptic future have nothing better to do than wage combat in urban arenas. It's like Marty McFly traveled back to a Thunderdome located in a dilapidated New York City. It's an amazing, if improbable, premise.   Tracers, as these future-day hooligans are called, busy themselves with cash-prize tournaments held in select areas of the city. Events run the gamut of street races and death matches to variants of capture the flag and the Olympic Biathlon (shooting targets). The hope is that you'll unseat the three reigning champs (who sport names like Demon and Bombzonie) during the course of eight-event tournaments - all while turning yourself into the baddest Tracer around.    Powerups are scattered throughout each course. Some, like board or weapon juice, refuel your boost and ammunition. Others affect your hoverboard's properties. They may grant invincibility or a temporary kit upgrade. Collected cash is used in-between events to trick out your hoverboard or weapons. Purchases either upgrade the damage you deal or increase various board qualities like engine, shielding, jump and boost.    Turns out, this brand of street racing isn't easy. Many events turn into cash collect-a-thons as you'll need all the advantage you can afford. Without upgrade help, you won't even be able to eat trace (the neon tails trailing behind hoverboards that grant a short boost if you ride across them).   Hoverboards are perpetual motion machines. Once the plank is turned on, it keeps going. The only form of control you have - besides steering - is to boost or power down. Cutting the engine (tapping X) will either help you whip around corners or, if applied liberally, grind to a halt. The mechanic makes sense, but its sensitivity never seems consistent. On one lap you may sweep gracefully around a hairpin turn; on the next you might smack straight into a guardrail.   The guy on top is in 1st, in case you couldn't tell. There's never a sense of mastery over your board. There's a sense that you're continually drifting across the screen independent of your instructions - adding to navigational frustration. The raceways, particularly Brooklyn Bridge, favor tight straights. Boards ricochet off tunnel walls, pinball down off-ramps and bang their way through tollbooths. Poor handling also dashes hopes of safely jumping gaps. Whether it's the control or the camera angles, it's common to miscalculate jumps - not only over- and under- shooting them, but also launching completely off the course. At least AI opponents consistently miss jumps too.    Handling is greatly improved in the arenas because slight slip-ups aren't catastrophic. Minute corrections to your course don't send your character flailing. On the other hand, arenas also look much larger than they actually are. If you unwittingly hop out of bounds, your Tracer falls through the world.    Arenas also sport far more grinding rails than the raceways, allowing you to actually aim your weapons at opponents as you automatically traverse the steel rail. When on the move, you must rely on auto-targeting. It's handy for heat-seeking rockets, and it's less effective with bombs, pulse rifles and your multi-shot. You have some slight control over the reticule, but it's mostly on the vertical plane. This isn't a dual-analog adventure.    Your AI-controlled counterparts take advantage of your weaknesses whenever possible. They have a tendency to glom onto you, particularly in arena combat. But the overall difficulty of tournaments depends on the host. Each has a particular strength. For instance Bombzonie, coincidentally, enjoys dropping bombs everywhere. He excels in combative challenges.    But for as much badditude that's infused into each Street Tracer, the whole experience is rather boring. Maybe it's the canned, corny catch phrases, or it's the fact that each character shares the same animations (including aggressive, shoulder-thrusting posturing). Like the dead city of New York, the Street Tracer experience feels lifeless and monotonous.   Where it should excel is in multiplayer, but even that grows tedious. There may be seven different modes, but for the most part they're just slight variations of the same theme. None force you to rethink your strategy. And it lacks any team-based or cooperative play.    Apparently you need to rely on more than hoverboards to make a game fun.Street Trace: NYC, where did you go wrong? Hoverboards, combat, angsty riders, and a cabal-ruined New York City should at least make for an amusing game. Instead it's dreadfully boring. It could be the poor board handling or the limited locals. I might fault the game's scope: three tournaments and a time trial (which has you either collecting flags, shooting targets, or both). It would also be nice if boards could grind more than very obvious rails. Perhaps that's the main problem. Your flailing character doesn't behave like a skateboarder or a snowboarder. The only ~tricks~ at your disposal are a few grinds and a flip (Woo!). I know this isn't Pro Hoverboarder, but it never actually feels like you're in control of a hoverboard. You could be in a spacecraft, on foot, or in a go-kart. And well, if you can't make hoverboards interesting in a hoverboard game, that's sort of a problem.", "date": "Aug 28, 2007"}
