I remember the first time I saw it, way back yonder when I was a kid of only nine.  Okay, well my parents didn't let me see it then, but a few years later my best friend's older brother rented it just to scare the hell out of us 12-year olds...and it worked.  Evil Dead made me a lifelong fan of the Evil Dead series, as well as the team-up of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell -- even the ill-fated The Adventures of Brisco County Junior.  With that said, I was really looking forward to playing Evil Dead: Hail to the King.  I mean, I played the Playstation version, and sure, it was complete crap...but come on, the PC can make anything shine, right?  Right? Ugh!  I can truly say that I found THQ's Hail to the King even scarier than I could have ever imagined...but in a bad way.  First off, this game just looks horrible.  Not only are you stuck in incredibly awkward camera angles as you make your way through the game, but the pre-rendered backgrounds just look hideous.  I thought one of the advantages to using pre-rendered backgrounds was so you could create an incredible visual experience without slowly down the game engine through overuse of polygons.  Instead the mottled, blurry backgrounds hardly look like they were improved over the Playstation version.  The low-poly character models look pathetic as well, and the stiff, jerky animation hardly gives the impression of life -- even if Ash is the only live one in the bunch.  The sound is almost as frightening as the graphics.  Although the orchestral, gothic soundtrack is well produced, the bland, canned sound effects hardly evoke the eerie mood they're supposed to, rather they'll make you laugh and tilt your head quizzically in disbelief that this could have gotten through QA testing.  Bruce Campbell's voice-overs are just as uninspired.  I don't know what happened to Bruce on the day they were recording his tracks for the game.  Usually Bruce has a powerful, expressive voice, and, after hearing him in a few games now, I believe his voice-work is some of the best in the biz.  However, something just wasn't clicking for him when he was recording Ash's voice for Hail to the King.  Instead of the enthusiast, energized Ash I remember from the movies, Ash comes off as bored and flaccid, even in the face of a horde of undead who want to eat your face.  For example, his raucous, ~Come get some!~ from the movies turns into a slightly bored, monotonous , ~Come get some...~ I guess, if you really wanna, but I'm more interested in my shoes right now, and I don't care if you want to eat my brains, go ahead if you must.   The suckage wasn't just saved for the visual and auditory portion of Hail to the King, though...no, no.  Gameplay is equally as tedious.  Again, the awkward camera angles, although cinematic, don't help an already ungainly combat system.  You figure Ash would be a major ass-kicker with a chain saw strapped to hi hand, but instead it takes about 10 hits before you can plow through an enemy.  This wouldn't be so bad if your undead attackers didn't constantly respawn, but seeing as they do, you hardly ever have any down time when you're not attacking and being attacked, which makes for one unhealthy Ash after a while, and one bored gamer in even less time.  The combat might not be so bad if you could actually plan out what you were doing and create a brilliant strategy for destroying the unending forces of evil, but combat essentially boils down to Ash swinging his chain saw wildly while running, and jumping back quickly to avoid getting hit.  Yawn!  Sure, you have other weapons in your arsenal, but none are as powerful as the chain saw, so why bother.  Gameplay itself is repetitive as well. Evil Dead is one of those games where you have to slowly scan across every wall pressing the ~action~ key to find hidden treasures since many of the items you'll find aren't represented by an icon -- most are, but some aren't.  Then, when you finally do find a certain object, you usually have to run to the other side of the haunted forest through the aforementioned never-ending onslaught of undead.  So just in case you couldn't tell by now, I wasn't very impressed with Evil Dead: Hail to the King. You know how Highlander 2 actually made Highlander worse?  Well, I could say the same about Evil Dead: Hail to the King...but I've already forgotten I played it.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
