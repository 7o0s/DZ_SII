A terrorist attack once is one thing -- twice and you've got to believe that he's wondering about bad coincidences. Three times and you figure that McClane must have been a high-ranking member of the Spanish Inquisition in a previous life, and is still paying off some heavy karmic debts. Die Hard Trilogy 2 is yet another glance into the life of a catastrophe magnet, and the venue for an unfortunate sequel that takes a good concept and drives it straight into the dumpster.  An old friend of McClane's has invited him to a big party celebrating his new job as warden of a top prison in Vegas, to take place at the penitentiary (of course), the party equivalent of a doctor having his anniversary dinner in the OR. Jump through that hoop of logic and you can swallow the fact that poor McClane's heading for yet another personal disaster, this time involving -- anyone?  anyone? -- a prison break. He should have been listening closer to that odd screechy orchestra music creeping up when the warden mentioned something about the infamous terrorist Klaus Von Haug locked in solitary.  A boom, a crash, and prisoners are spilling free like skittles all over the desert sands of Vegas, taking over the banquet hall and making an attempt to run free care of a plot involving a casino owner and a supermodel/spy named Goshkin who's taken to squeezing into old prom dresses better suited to the junior miss section. And of course the police is nowhere to be seen, and it's up to you to make things right.  DHT2's big trick is that it promises three types of game in one package -- racing, shooting, and third-person action. You can practice levels, take on the game in a movie mode that blends the game types into one cohesive adventure. If you're interested in quick action you can play the arcade mode and try out the levels for each separate game, with the catch being that you won't be able to play through some exclusive movie mode levels that way. With other hybrid titles making some good strides on the PC it sounds like a great idea, but unfortunately DHT2 provides a limited experience all the way around, coupled with a story that belittles the DH series.  First off, to enjoy this game in any way you'll have to step over the graphics. Though they're 3D accelerated, they still have the detail levels of the original PlayStation version, which means that you can expect chunky characters and some of the flattest neon you've ever seen in Vegas. The first-person shooter level fares a lot better than the other sections however, and overall the interactive experience more than made up for the chunkiness. The sound is thumpa thumpa techno that ranges from pretty good to El Generico brand lameness, with a couple of real songs provided to spice up the game.  Third Person, Far From First  The third person experience would cause children to riot on a console, but on the PC, where such romping is more of a rarity, it... no, it still pretty much sucks. Blocky characters, bad controls, and a fun-sucking atmosphere turn taking out terrorists into an experience of walking through halls and pressing the fire key while you try to get McClane to dodge, or do something evasive while he's being blasted. He drives a bit like a tank, and fires like one, so you can pretty much let him auto-target and fire away while you watch the enemies go down. Puzzles are all very standard find the key fare, and the weapons are usually more of an annoyance than the standard pistol. This is one of the few games where a shotgun is actually more useless than a standard issue handgun. Frankly, the NRA would be horrified if they found out that this game was promoting such heretic concepts. In attempt to keep the camera sane the designers have designed a system where it actually fades through walls behind you, which keeps the distance from the character constant, but also allows you to see the contents of rooms without actually having to enter them. It's funnier than it is practical, and just adds to the awkward, clumsy, and fumbling third person experience.  Where's the Chicken Brake?  Most of the racing experience consists of either tracking down a bomb in a crowded downtown area and bringing it back to a specific point, or ramming enemy cars within a certain time limit. The emphasis is on quick action, so you can chuck any thoughts of a simulation experience out the window. The controls are simple, and by simple I mean boring. The levels either consist of square blocks filled with pedestrians and cars, or of open road that you'll have to navigate as you find alternate paths and dodge obstacles. It's sort of like the Road Runner video game, only without the coyotes and without the fun. Though you're able to drive a good number of vehicles, and although the designers have tried to vary the driving experience, the end product is forced and stale, and the general feeling of the experience is kind of ridiculous when compared to the rest of the game. For instance, when you ram a car into oblivion/defuse a bomb, you get an befuddling animation consisting of the car exploding about 20 feet in the air and landing back on the ground again, which makes you feel like you're playing a degraded version of Crazy Taxi instead of a high-speed action game. Alright, so we are talking about video games here, but is it wrong that I want something with a little more tension and action for a game based on the movie series, rather than a 3D version of Frogger?  The Good Gun  The saving grace of DHT2 is the shooter game, which is a nice mix of Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, something rarely seen on the PC. It may be simple, but it's done nicely, and with a mouse it plays like a dream (if not a little too easy). Nearly everything on the screen can be shot, blown up, or broken in some way by bullets, even down to tiny details like the plates and glasses in the reception hall of the prison. The addition of being able to toss grenades at enemies while you're firing may not always be helpful, but it's certainly fun, and a nice addition to the shooter genre. The graphics come across a lot better than the other segments, and the camera work really lends a cinematic feel to what should have been a cinematic game.  I've always liked the Die Hard series for its great mix of humor, action, and tension, and it's sad to see it all thrown away for a haphazard sequel. None of the segments really translates the feel of the Die Hard series, and worse yet, the appalling story bleeds lameness that if you're not careful, could actually stain your copies of the original trilogy. Nice concept, but badly played. Maybe Die Hard: Relic Hunter will do better.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Mar 17, 2000"}
