I always purchased both ShootOut and NBA Live because there always were aspects of both that I liked and disliked.  Graphically, ShootOut stood a bit taller then EA's game, with better colors, dimensions and reflections.  On the other hand, EA's game seemed more balanced overall, and proved a rewarding experience too.  The two were simply the antithesis of each other.  As years progressed, EA's game really began to take shape and edged itself well ahead of ShootOut in all areas -- with the exception of frame-rate and graphics.  The cameras were more configurable, the replay system was more intuitive and the collective experience, with the deep play calling and editing functions really made the game shine.  This time around, EA has put forth an even more balanced product -- one that addresses old issues without creating new ones.  Basketball fever is hummin' NBA Live 2001 just might be your ticket to ride.  Presentation No matter how many reviews of EA Sports titles one reads, there is always some reference to the exemplary way that EA always handles its game presentation.  Besides working diligently to assure that most of the basic components of a given sport or incorporated into their titles, EA goes beyond the norm to include numerous other aspects of the sporting experience. They pioneered TV-style presentations, took the forefront on developing multimedia flash and glitz, and have been the benchmark by which most other offerings are compared against in the presentation category.  Despite the few instances where a mental lapse, personnel change or managerial mishap have permitted unsavory things to happen to their product presentations, EA has established itself like the Yankees of the 20th century.  They have really worked hard to dominate in this area and have proven that old dogs learn new tricks.  The same goes for NBA Live 2001. Glitzy and snappy from start to Championship, this game exudes nothing but polish.  That is certainly a perception that could have been easily diluted and eclipsed by the pending PS2 launch.  Yet, in spite of that fact, EA has produced a game that bears all the flava and hype of the original, albeit with a much better sense of balance and pizzazz.  They have installed the requisite polygon boost, new animations and sound enhancements.  They have also made sure that NBA Live 2001 takes advantage of  a ~challenge mode~ similar to that which is being used in the football titles.  The crowds are more interactive, the sidelines are busier and the stadiums have not been left out of the facelift department.  An area that I frequently did not like about the ~Live~ series, the stadiums in Live 2001 have  much better look -- which then gives the game a much better feel.  From playing full seasons to abbreviated contests or analyzing the entire horde of available statistical data.  This game's got it right.  Gameplay Rarely has there even been a time in the history of sports game development that the implementation of new (mo-cap) moves actually achieved the result of positively impacting the gameplay of  a title -- as much as it has here with NBA Live 2001.  From the up-and-under to the flawless execution of the fade-away jumper, the game has made serious strides in the right direction.  The back down actually shows momentum derived from weight differentials and if you want you can position for the short hook shot that annoyingly lofts over the defenders head for two.  As players pound away for position under the basket, you can watch as the offensive and defensive players try to gain proper position, with a much better effort and depiction that in year's past.  While I cannot begin to say that all is perfect in terms of the game's complete gameplay implementation, I can certainly tell you that the improvements, like the ones mentioned above, have really made a positive impact.  Players no longer feel as 'slippery' as they did in years past, posting up achieves more of the desired reactions and results and lanes are much more identifiable.  You can place players better, based upon better collision routines and the AI aspects of the game make better use of the allotted space.  More times than not, I found that the game reacted much better to broken defensive assignments.  Reaction times and the decisions made by the CPU are vastly improved over some of the inane mistakes we have been used to seeing in almost every basketball game on the system.  You will no longer see players across court attempting to cover someone on a pick unless they are in the proper rotation to do so.  I can't tell you how many times I watched in horror as the opposing teams best shooter was left completely alone because the AI controlled players decided to Kamikaze the man covering half way across court.  Not in Live 2001!  Players position well, and the AI creativeness to the ball and movement is brisk and logical.  The computer will double team where needed and if you do so, it will kick the ball back out and into the low post until something frees up for a scoring opportunity.  Also, do not think you can go for the perpetual slam-dunk  after dunk routine.  AI defensive shifts thwart that tactic much more quickly than before.  In fact, if you study the deployment of players across the court you will find that they frequently try to capitalize on maximum position -- almost always.  So you don't get the old routine where the defender runs up an jumps into your face, only to plant his feet as if there were in cement and park I one spot.  Even as you dribble the ball in place, the defender will maximize his position relative to your player's center and the perceived direction of the ball.  It is quite simply a more dynamic tracking mechanism that results in a visualization that makes Live 2001 look more like real basketball.  One aspect that EA has always spent an inordinate amount of time struggling with has been rebounds.  In year's past, the rebounding issues have been many.  First, the ball bounced way too high off the rim.  Then it danced on the rim too much.  Then there were the times it would rocket outward several feet away from the rim all too often.  This was an every growing  issue of trying engineer a problem out of a game, only to re-engineer news ones right back into it.  Fortunately, EA found that this was not only a problem inherent with the ~Live~ series.  This issue has plagued many basketball titles from Konami's In the Zone to 989's ShootOut.  Well, EA was not much better off.  Nevertheless, as it seems, years of trying can garner positive results.  While this is another aspect that gets high marks, there are still issues that result when there are too many people under the boards trying to snag the ball.  However, you really can go for the position and sky to vie for the ball this time around.  Actually, I found that there is far less frustration in determining how to get the loose rock, and that always bodes well when you are playing B-ball.  Graphics In terms of the pure graphic package, Live 2001 is about as good as EA Canada can get it.  PlayStation is more daunting to program for now than when we started some five years ago.  Think about it?  The early stuff was all visually stunning...for the time.  Over time, the benchmark has been raised with each innovation and power surge that developers can extrapolate from the system and the quest for better graphics becomes a bit tougher each time.  Once you have developed all of the available tricks and visual treats (a Halloween pun ];-)  you then have to find ways to make those aspects of the visual presentation better, without ultimately sacrificing the game's playability in the interim.  Well, I am glad it is not me with that task.  Players and reviewers alike are notorious for slamming a company when a game is all eye-candy without any gameplay substance.  Live 2001 does not let the gamer down.  The game comes off the production line looking good, feeling good, playing very well and doing many other things right.  And get this...all at the same time!  Be it the textures, the color palette, the logos and markings or the rotation of the ball, Live 2001 seemingly has struck a nice balance to achieve a game that doesn't do much to offend in any category.  Proportionally the players have some small inconsistencies, but they are minute in comparison to how the total package comes across as clean and polished.  As I mentioned, I have many times found ShootOut to be the nicer looking game, EA has done much to maintain the integrity of their visual appeal while improving their graphics to better compete.  The new Cyberscan process has resulted in better renditions of player skins and craniums.  Yup...their heads look a whole lot better.  Remember the first time Shaq appeared in Live?  Eh-gads!!!  He was a horror show...sorry Shaq...but it was true.  They had him looking like something out of a B-movie from the 1940s.  Well he still isn't anyone's beauty queen, but he is cool son-of-gun nonetheless, and now I can tell who he is when I play the game.  All that and no more fright.  Thank goodness!  Player animations are significantly more homogenous and pliant and the transitional animations have been well affected into the stream of tactile gameplay.  So, you don't have to worry about players doing one thing while you are directing them to do another.  Smooth, manageable and fun are all key elements of success and Live 2001 has these in spades.  Sound Here is the deal.  You have Bob Elliot calling the game.  Using ~event stack~ technology, EA has been able to effectively assure that there are less blunders and more vocal wonders.  This tends to keep the comments in the stream queue up to snuff based upon what is happening in the game.  Our evaluation of this feature is that it works quite well.  The quality of the sound in Live 2001 shows an improvement, especially in the way EA has chosen to balance the audio and adjust the attenuation of volume, bass and treble.  For the most part, the game sounds come off clean.  There are some instances where things get a bit brash and forward sounding, but for the most part everything is readily tolerable -- especially the in-game music tracks that serve to hype the watching throngs of fans. Well...we know it is really for you, because ~dem ain't no real fans in dem stands, huh?~  Without grasping for straws here, I must add that what EA has learned with the advent of the dynamic crowds found in Madden and NCAA 2001, it has employed here as well and the results are very sweet indeed. You can take the crowd right out of the game with a few unanswered points or have them howling at manic levels when you're thrashing the other guys.Whether you buy in just to play and unlock classic teams, or only seek to crush the challenges such as winning by 10 or making the famed triple-double, EA's NBA Live 2001 is about as well-rounded a game of basketball that one is likely to find on PlayStation. But wait!  989 Studios may have something to say about that?  Well...truth is, we expect to see that two good games have emerged from these venerable camps.  In the meantime, however, EA is once again first out of the gate, and there offering is strong and purtty!", "date": "Oct 21, 2000"}
