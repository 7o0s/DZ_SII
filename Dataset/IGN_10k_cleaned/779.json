The game, which featured a polished 3D engine designed by developer NeverSoft Entertainment, also touted remarkable skating physics, a finely tuned combo system and a two-player split-screen mode (among other goodies). All of the above added for what was quite possibly the best skateboarding game ever made  and now it's available for Nintendo 64.  Features  Skate as one of 10 popular pros including Tony Hawk. Pull off hundreds of moves and combinations including airs, grabs, grinds, kick-flips and landing tricks. A variety of two-player split-screen multiplayer modes. Instant replays of tricks and matches. Nine different 3D environments to skate through including everything from parks and schools to the local mall and Area 51.  Intuitive 3D engine makes skating anywhere a possibility; grind on rails, ollie onto cars,  etc., etc. Catchy music from bands like Primus and The Dead Kennedys.  Memory Pak save features.   Gameplay Tony Hawk Pro Skater is one of those rare games that absolutely nails everything it sets out to do. In this case, it's re-created the gravity-defying sport of skateboarding to the fullest extent. To accomplish this grand task, the title's original design team enlisted the help of real pro boarders like (obviously) Tony Hawk, and Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, Rune Glifberg, Bucky Lasek, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Geoff Rowley, and Jamie Thomas  all of which are playable in the game. The results speak for themselves. The end PlayStation product hammers along with a generally steady framerate while drawing open 3D environments for players to enjoy (for the most part) in a completely non-linear fashion. This means skating anywhere, stunting everywhere, and all with virtually no restrictions. To keep everything in balance, NeverSoft also included a handful of downhill courses to coincide with the wide-open lot, and then topped everything off with an excellent trick-point system and various goals that must be achieved in every level. Most important (and probably most tricky from a developer's standpoint) of all, though, is the game's overwhelmingly tight control and realistic skater physics. When a trick is pulled off correctly, it not only looks dead-on, but feels perfect too. And when a skater falls on his face, we know exactly why it happened.  To Nintendo 64 Port. It's a scary word, and one that is used too often when Nintendo 64 software is concerned. With countless system hand-me-overs ruined by the transition to the 64-bit console, it's no secret why we're generally opposed to the idea. However, this is thankfully not the case with Texas-based developer Edge of Reality's (Monster Truck Madness 64) ingenious adaptation of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise. The Nintendo 64 version plays every bit as good as its PlayStation predecessor.  After selecting their skateboarder of choice (each boarder starts out with minimal skills that must be built up over play), gamers are free to enter the first environment and tear things up. Tony Hawk Pro Skater N64, like the PlayStation game before it, features a substantial learning curve so don't expect to be pulling off the big tricks and combos right out of the gate. Edge of Reality has set the standard control to accept both digital and analog input. Ollies are handled with the C-down button, C-up enables grinds and wall-riding, and the remaining C-buttons work with the D-Pad (or analog stick) for a variety of different grabs, spins, and flips. Oddly, the A and B buttons are not used. It should be noted, however, that while this setup is standard, players have the option of configuring the control to their personal preference.   At first, you're likely to skate around the environments holding and depressing the C-down button to ollie. This is the learning period and unless you're a glutton for embarrassment, you won't want your buddies watching this. But as you continue to play, you'll begin to pick up on the game's many subtleties and you'll be a better skater for it. For instance, the first time you ollie over a rail, you'll probably fall flat on your face and curse. We did. With a little more practice, though, you'll soon discover that by pressing and holding the C-up button as you come down on rails, you can grind on them. Herein lies another problem  balance. The first time you grind, you're likely to teeter over too far on one side and bail. But as you continue to try it out, you'll come to master the grinds and before you know it, you'll be sliding across entire rails and, ollie-kick-flipping off and landing for bonus points. This is how the game works and boy is it fun.  To keep the experience interesting, THPS features a wide variety of fun skate levels, many of which are wide-open and totally non-linear. Because the game is largely about scoring the biggest possible stunts in order to rack up points, the overall open design of environments lends itself to practicing, experimenting and eventually prevailing. The game also boasts a wide variety of challenges in each arena, including collecting tapes in order to unlock new levels and boards, and spelling 'skate' by collecting the five hidden, often hovering letters in each level. Once the stunts run dry  and they won't  you can entertain yourself by taking the extra challenges.  Two-player mode Like the PlayStation version, THPS N64 features a split-screen two-player mode in which you can skate against another friend (or enemy) while trying to score more points. Obviously, this works in the same fashion as the single-player game, whereby points are achieved by pulling off amazing tricks and combos. The game also boasts an interesting skate-tag mode, where various parts of the 3D environments change color after an impressive stunt has been landed on them. The colors reflect the player who pulled off the stunt. So, the idea is to turn more of the skating environment your color. Meanwhile, it's also possible to recapture a piece of the environment (after your opponent has landed a trick on it) and change it back to your color by executing a bigger, better stunt. Both modes are hugely addictive and a whole lot of fun. And thankfully, everything runs smoothly enough that the framerate never bothers.  Graphics The visuals in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater N64 are very impressive. Skaters are well modeled and animate fluidly, and the environments themselves are generally huge and, somewhat surprisingly considering this is a PlayStation port, detailed. The bad news here is that the texture design is not on par with the PlayStation game, which generally looks much crisper. The good news is that the framerate, believe it or not, is actually improved over the 32-bit version and that is brilliant trade-off so far as we're concerned. With all of this said, the THPS N64 is still quite the looker, featuring a top fluidity, huge wide-open environments with very little fogging (except in the San Francisco level), and little added extras like faked light-sourcing and spark particle effects as boards grind across steel. Quite frankly, this was the one area that we were concerned developer Edge of Reality might have trouble in, and we're happy to say that our fears have been obliterated. Some fans may be disappointed to learn that the blood has been removed for the N64 game, but it was a little over-the-top anyway so the omission really doesn't bother us. Also, the FMV back-screens featured in the PlayStation game have been removed for obvious reasons.   Sound Again, there is good and bad here, but in the end the good definitely outweighs the bad. The game features a whole lot of the punk music featured in the CD-driven PlayStation game including the likes of Primus and The Dead Kennedys. Better, the songs come off surprisingly clear considering that they've been transformed to cartridge and compressed to no end. The bad part is that while most of the songs are present, many of them have been dumbed down in order to make the cut to cartridge. Some songs no longer feature lyrics and there is quite a bit of looping going on. In the end, though, we have to realize that audio is one of Nintendo 64's biggest limitations and given what they had to work with, Edge of Reality has done an impressive job bringing the ambient soundtrack home.   Sound effects are dead-on. We can hear the wheels of our boards rolling over grooves in the skate environments, crashes, thuds, clanks, steel grinds and grunts when our skater takes a nose-dive off a ramp and into the ground. Really, it's all there and it sounds great. The first time I played Tony Hawk Pro Skater for PlayStation I was in heaven. The game totally nailed the skateboarding sensation I was looking for, delivering realistic board and rider physics, an unparalleled trick and combo system and enough non-linear environments to keep me busy forever. So when I heard about Activision's decision to port the game over to Nintendo 64, I had my doubts, mainly in regards to the visuals and framerate. But with that said, I couldn't be happier with the final product developer Edge of Reality has given us. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater N64 is every bit as good as the PlayStation version, features all the boarders, tricks, environments and different gameplay modes, and looks beautiful. While the game's textures are overall less crisp than those in the PlayStation game and the music tracks have been dumbed down, the framerate is actually improved!Simply put, the best skateboarding game ever created just got a little better. If you're even remotely interested in this title, I recommend running to your nearest retailer right now and picking it up. You're going to love it.", "date": "Mar 15, 2000"}
