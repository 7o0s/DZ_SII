{"name": "Samurai Warriors", "name_review": "Samurai Warriors", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/14/samurai-warriors", "text": "Gamers around the globe know the small Japanese company Koei for having a love affair with history. With underground cult favorites like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dynasty Warriors to their credit, the growing company has strove in recent years to make some of the best history-related strategy games on the market. Regardless of its niche space in the overall gaming realm, games like Dynasty Warriors have hit the mainstream more than ever as of late, catalyzing the release of Samurai Warriors in America this past May on PlayStation2. A testament to the growing demand of Koei products, the game has been released, now, on the Xbox. But while the game is better looking and runs smoother than its PlayStation2 counterpart, it doesn't quite measure up to the visual standards for Xbox. Though many may find joy in the simplicity of Samurai Warriors' button-mashing style, it's certainly not for everyone.   Those familiar with Koei's Dynasty Warriors series can expect a very similar experience with Samurai Warriors. While the storyline has changed from Chinese ~history~ to Japanese ~history~ (being that the history the game hits you with is more fantastical myth than anything that a historian may call concrete), it's just as powerful and involving as you can expect. The beauty of this title is the fact that you follow the storyline from all sides, and from the perspective of several different characters. While you might be playing some of the same missions, maps, and sides of the massive conflict with different characters, it's how you play each mission with each character that truly makes the game enjoyable.   Of course, playing through with each character can be a challenge for some gamers, not because of any inherent challenge Samurai Warriors brings along with it, but for the monotony of the gameplay itself. No matter how you put it, Samurai Warriors, like Dynasty Warriors before it, is a button masher's paradise. You can easily get through the game with each character by using the same automatic combos provided to you by simply pressing the X button a whole lot. Fighting even the most difficult enemies in the game, such as captains and leaders of the various armed forces, provide little difficulty. The inclusion of a magic meter of sorts, called Musou, which allows the user to do super-powerful moves and combos, battles become even easier.     You can make combat more difficult for yourself by using various combos you can purchase after battle with Skill Points you earn as you fight (depending on how you perform various specified objectives during battle), or you can simply up the difficulty level. But even then, the fighting seems mindless, using sheer numbers of enemies with weak AI as opposed to perhaps a lesser number of foes that fight more intelligently. In a game where epic battles are the norm, where you are expected to fight massive army against massive army, you'd expect that you wouldn't have to kill 90% of the army by yourself. Fortunately for you, the fighting itself is never a challenge.   Samurai Warriors instead provides the gamer with frustration found within battle apart from the actual fighting, where certain tasks must be met in each mission in order to successfully complete the mission. A set of circumstances, unique for each mission, exist for failure as well. For instance, in one mission, you must ultimately fight and kill the army leader of the forces invading your small castle, but you can't allow any of the army leaders on your side to perish or you will automatically lose the fight. This means that you have to run around the map like a madman, fending off enemies that threaten certain key characters that cannot die, while still keeping your primary objective or objectives in mind.   However, this kind of system can be a blessing to many gamers, who like depth over pure gameplay. Samurai Warriors certainly provides depth, as there are also smaller quests and objectives within missions that, when completed, will give you more experience, skill points, and even better items and weapons. For example, while you might have to kill off one particular enemy to end the mission, you'll have the option, as the game prompts you, to help out specific forces fight off some foes, kill other specific enemies, or whatever else the game might tell you to do. This adds immense depth to a formula that might otherwise leave the player disappointed with the simplistic nature of most missions. While you can just get on a horse, run through the enemies and go straight for the foe you have to kill on a certain mission, you'll be rewarded statistically by successfully completing sub-quests within each mission, thus raising your stats exponentially.    Samurai Warriors stresses replay value over one-time gaming. Items and weapons that are found randomly in battle, simply by running into their location or by killing certain enemies, can only be found after multiple playthroughs, since their location and consequent occurrence are arbitrary. Equipping and using these weapons and items also warrants replay, since missions become easier as your stats and abilities increase, which allows you to do more in each mission than you might have been able to do previously. Combined with the fifteen characters available in the game, dedicated and focused gamers who are into what a title like Samurai Warriors has to offer will be full of glee, as their money will be well-spent.   Graphically, Samurai Warriors is occasionally impressive, but not at the level of many current Xbox titles. The CG sequences will awe you, especially the game's intro, which is simply stunning. Graphics in battle are also nice, although less impressive due to the bland and dark colors, that, while fitting, don't add the game's visual flair. However, while the character animations are well done and the various friendlies and foes look quite good, the environment in which they interact leaves a lot to be desired. I found myself especially mystified by the tall grasses one can move through in the game, which don't so much as bend or flex when you run through them. When there are bodies piled up on some wheat blades, you'd expect them to somehow react. Yet, they don't.   The sound in the game is also lackluster. While you can keep the original Japanese voice acting (which adds authenticity to the game), the English voice actors go from good to bad, and from fitting to annoying. Musically, Samurai Warriors sounds fine, but the amazingly trite and overly-repeated battle noises will make you mute your television, or better yet, throw on some 311, in a matter of minutes. One can only hear the ~huh!~, ~ha!~ and ~ahhh!~ of death before they need some of that sweet-sounding ~Transistor~ massaging their eardrums.  Koei fills a void in gaming that only they can, and Samurai Warriors fits their normal bill. With RPG elements added and stat-building somewhat required, Koei may have branched out with this attempt to a wider audience, encompassing their old fans and with RPG fans as well, but even then, the game doesn't seem to provide enough. Simplistic fighting that one has to actively make more difficult for him or herself is never a welcome addition to any game, and while the storyline of Samurai Warriors is well-executed in the game, and while the depth of the game is ever-present, it's not enough to save the title from monotony and boredom for most gamers.Fighting along with weapon and item collecting aside, replay value is increased by modes such as Survival and Challenge. While these modes of play allow you to fight endless amounts of enemies with the various characters in various situations, increasing your skill as a player, they will likely still bore you to death. New Officer Mode is also an interesting addition, as is Free Mode, but when Story Mode is the draw to the game, and it seems lackluster for most, it doesn't speak volumes on the game's appeal. Buy only if you're confident that replay value which feels monotonous is your style. And if you were interested in the title on the PlayStation 2 but passed it up, reconsider it on the Xbox, where the looks and feel are slightly enhanced.", "date": "Jul 14, 2004"}
