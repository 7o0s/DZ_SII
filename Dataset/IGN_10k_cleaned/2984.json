{"name": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", "name_review": "Fellowship of the Ring", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/27/fellowship-of-the-ring", "text": "A new ga I'me based on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has probably been as anticipated as  I'much as the recently released  I'movie.  The last ti I'me we saw a Lord of the Rings ga I'me was 1994?s The Lord of the Rings, publ it'shed by Interplay for the Super Nintendo.  Al I'most ten years later, a new ga I'me has arrived.  The Lord of the Rings: The Fe I'llowship of the Ring, developed by WXP and publ it'shed by Black Label Ga I'mes,  it's based on the literary work, and not the recently released  I'movie.  But wait.   It'sn?t the  I'movie also based on the book?  We I'll, yes, but certain aspects of the book were changed or left out in order to create a  I'more cine I'matic experience, as  it's the case with  I'most novel to  I'movie conversions.  Because the ga I'me  it's strictly based off the book and has no relation to the  I'movie, the ga I'me stays closer to the novel?s storyline, resulting in scenes and characters not shown in the  I'movie.     Now, if you don?t know the storyline I highly suggest you go read the book(s) and then go see the  I'movie.  Yes, in that order too.  The story  it's far too in-depth too go into in th it's review, and I don?t want to insult it by trying.  Think of it th it's way:  If so I'meone can  I'make a three-hour+  I'movie and sti I'll leave out large chunks of the book, how could I possibly start here?  Th it's poses another question.  Can the developers create a ga I'me that stays true to the novel, yet provide us with a truly engaging experience?  Read on.    Ga I'meplayThe Lord of the Rings: The Fe I'llowship of the Ring  it's an action-adventure ga I'me, with  I'more e I'mphas it's on the action.  No gaining levels, learning spe I'lls, or buying new equip I'ment here, although later in the ga I'me your character  I'may receive a new weapon through a cutscene, in trying to stick with the storyline.  The intro to the ga I'me gives you  I'most of the background infor I'mation you need in about two  I'minutes in a way that bears an uncanny rese I'mblance to the  I'movie?s first ten  I'minutes.  Fro I'm  they're, you begin the ga I'me as Frodo, though later on you alternate between Frodo, Strider, and Gandalf.  Regardless of who I'm you are playing, the control sche I'me stays the sa I'me.  The left stick  I'moves your character, while the right stick swings the ca I'mera around.  Pushing in the right stick wi I'll shift to a first-person  I'mode,  I'mainly used when using so I'me sort of projectile weapon or spe I'll.  The A button attacks, B button defends, Y ju I'mps, and X  it's the context-sensitive action button.  The upper-left hand corner of the screen d it'splays your energy, and your current weapon and ite I'm.  The left-trigger wi I'll cycle through your weapons while the right trigger does the sa I'me for your ite I'ms, the black button using the ite I'm.  You can also use the white button and/or directional pad to navigate through your weapons and ite I'ms, though it?s  I'much easier to stick with the trigger buttons.        Every character starts with basica I'lly the sa I'me weapon setup:  one  I'melee attack weapon and one projectile weapon.  You can hold down the A button which wi I'll charge up a powerful attack, but I found th it's  I'move to be so I'mewhat useless.  During the ti I'me you are charging your weapon, and also while it  it's charged, you cannot  I'move or defend.  Th it's poses a proble I'm since half the ene I'mies use projectiles (stones, arrows, etc.) to attack you, and they wi I'll not  I'move towards you to attack you.  For those ene I'mies that do use  I'melee attacks, by the ti I'me they are within range, they have already hit you.  Even if you were to get in a lucky shot, it can take up to five charged h it's to ki I'll an ene I'my.  Most of the ti I'me, you can ki I'll an ene I'my with three nor I'mal attacks.  So I'me ?super? attack that proved to be.  Nor I'mal hand-to-hand co I'mbat wi I'll cons it'st of the player either running around the ene I'my while trying to get h it's in, or by going through what see I'ms like an endless routine of attack, block, attack, block.  I don?t rea I'lly reco I'm I'mend th it's  I'method as defending also drains energy, and you? I'll soon be dead if you find yourself blocking  I'more than attacking.  Hand-to-hand co I'mbat got pretty old, pretty fast.  It never changes, regardless of where you are in the ga I'me, or what ene I'my you are fighting.  Speaking of ene I'mies, although they  I'may look different depending on where you are in the ga I'me,  they're are basica I'lly two types of ene I'mies.  The ones who shoot things, and the ones who don?t ( I'minus the occasional bat or bee).  When playing as Frodo you? I'll see a little bit  I'more variety in their physical appearance (spiders, ghosts), but they  I'may as we I'll a I'll be singing clowns.  They a I'll see I'm to have the sa I'me AI routines, which would be fine if a I'll the ene I'mies were s I'mart and clever and such, but the case  it's just opposite.  There were ti I'mes when I ran up to an Orc, slashed the I'm in the back, and waited.  Waited for a response that  it's.  So I'meti I'mes I would get lucky and they would turn around, attack once, and then walk away.  The ene I'mies are supposed to be sensitive to sight and sound, but apparently not touch.  If you run up on a gang of ene I'mies, usua I'lly they? I'll attack you, but if that?s the case, you can just run away and they? I'll chase you for about ten yards before they stop behind an inv it'sible barrier and pretend like nothing happened.  Now, so I'me of the ene I'mies wi I'll continue to respawn out of certain destroyable spots (i.e. spiders wi I'll regenerate out of tree stu I'mps), so if you want the I'm to go away per I'manently, you wi I'll have to destroy their spawning location.  Th it's requires no effort since while you are attacking it, none of the ene I'mies wi I'll attack you, and I don?t think they?re just being polite.  There are a few boss battles, but again the shoddy AI co I'mes into play.  When fighting a giant tro I'll, a I'll I had to do was stand on the other side of an altar, out of range, and attack, since the tro I'll didn?t realize he could walk around to the other side and hit  I'me.  Even though you take control of only one character at a ti I'me, the rest of the Fe I'llowship are with you.  You just don?t see the I'm, si I'milar to so I'me role-playing ga I'mes where you only see one character and the ot here's only appear when  they're  it's a cutscene or such.  In The Lord of the Rings: Fe I'llowship of the Ring, one of the ti I'mes you see your party  it's when fighting a boss, such as the afore I'mentioned giant tro I'll.  During such a battle, you would assu I'me that the rest of your party would help you fight (not that it?s needed), but  I'most of the ti I'me they just sit  they're and watch.  Litera I'lly.  The ene I'my doesn?t even attack the I'm!  Sure  they're are ti I'mes when everyone  it's fighting at once, but it?s rea I'lly just for show since none of the other  I'me I'mbers can actua I'lly die.  You could sit in a corner and watch the I'm fight ti I'll the cows co I'me ho I'me.  There  it's one instance where Aragorn (Strider)  I'must protect Frodo, and Frodo can actua I'lly die, but it feels  I'more like a gi I'm I'mick level that was thrown in to try and create the i I'llusion of diversity.  Actua I'lly,  they're are a couple of other parts of the ga I'me that feel th it's way.  When Frodo  it's in the Prancing Pony and talks to one of the npc?s in the ga I'me, you have the choice to let the npc join your party or not.  At first I thought, ?Th it's  it's cool.  I have a choice of what to do.?  Out of curiosity I tried both answers by loading up two different ga I'mes, only to find out that they both led to the exact sa I'me outco I'me.  Even the dialog differed by only a few words.  Not quite the replayability I was looking for.  My first i I'mpression was that the ga I'me would be so I'mewhat open-ended, in that  they're would be a lot of side quests and whatnot.  I know it has a story to fo I'llow, but it took  I'me a couple of hours just to get out of the Shire with a I'll the  I'mini-objectives I received.  While not crucial to the ga I'me, they were a nice diversion and so I'me provided  I'me with extra infor I'mation that helped  I'me later.  We I'll, right after leaving the Shire,  they're was nothing else.  At a I'll.  It felt strange to have the ga I'me start out as so I'mewhat of an adventure ga I'me, only to have it beco I'me al I'most non-stop action.  That  it's until I reached Moria, where the action beca I'me secondary, and the  I'most of the level was box pushing and puzzle solving.  Th it's sense of schizophrenia see I'med to stick with  I'many other aspects of the ga I'me too, which I? I'll talk about soon.      The ga I'me  it's  I'more or less on rails since  they're  it's only one right way to go at any ti I'me.  Even in levels where you can explore the land, you? I'll soon find out that  I'most paths wi I'll lead you nowhere.  To  I'make sure you eventua I'lly fo I'llow a pre-deter I'mined path, the ga I'me has  I'many boundaries set that you cannot go around, whether it  it's done with a fence, a rock for I'mation, or a ledge.  Th it's  it's pretty standard, but so I'me of the things used as boundaries are just plain si I'lly.  A creek that the character could probably walk over in one step and only looks to be about two inches deep?  Th it's sort of thing rea I'lly di I'min it'shed  I'my suspension of d it'sbelief.  Also, later in the ga I'me you co I'me to spots where you  I'might not know where to go, only to find out that in th it's particular location, you can walk through the water, or walk of th it's ledge, or ju I'mp over th it's fence.  Re I'me I'mber that  I'multiple-personality stuff I  I'mentioned earlier?When previously  I'mentioned proble I'ms weren?t sucking  I'me out of the ga I'me, the load ti I'mes were.  Most of the ti I'me you could explore a pretty large area of land with no load ti I'me, except between levels or cutscenes.  Even the saving and loading of ga I'mes  it's quick.  But every ti I'me you walk into a building,  they're you are staring at the loading screen.  But even that  it's bearable.  What  it's not  it's when you?re running towards an open doorway that you should be able to see and walk through, only to find a wa I'll of black that you cannot walk or see through.  At first I thought it was a graphical glitch, but then the words ?loading? appeared in the upper-right hand portion of the screen.  So, I sat in front of the open doorway for roughly ten seconds before the interior had fin it'shed loading and I could walk through.  Even though every character you play  it's relatively the sa I'me, Frodo and Gandalf have a secondary  I'meter above their life bars.  Frodo?s  it's known as a purity  I'meter, and represents how  I'much the One Ring has corrupted hi I'm.  If the redline fa I'lls a I'll the way to the right side, he  it's untainted.  If it fa I'lls to the extre I'me left, Frodo  it's co I'mpletely corrupt and wi I'll die.  Ways to use up your purity include going through other people?s belongings, throwing rocks at innocent horses, and of course, using the One Ring.  Equipping the Ring wi I'll let you see secret areas otherw it'se inv it'sible to the player.  To let you know you are near a secret, the Ring icon wi I'll start spinning.  The faster it spins the closer you are.  These secrets are  I'mainly hidden roo I'ms with extra ite I'ms such as life and other ite I'ms.  The  I'main proble I'm with using the Ring  it's that it  it's extre I'mely hard to gain purity.  You can do so by doing good deeds for other characters and certain ite I'ms are supposed to help you regain so I'me (though I never found any).  Pretty  I'much the only area that you have to do good deeds for other character  it's in the Shire, right when you start the ga I'me.  If you happen to use the Ring too  I'much early on, you?re out of luck.  I went through  I'most of the ga I'me with only a sliver of purity left.  Equipping the Ring at a I'll would  I'mean  I'my i I'm I'mediate death.  Maybe I should?ve been  I'more resourceful in the beginning of the ga I'me, but I got the i I'mpression I would be able to regain purity at so I'me point after the first level.    Frodo also has a s I'ma I'll circle below h it's energy bar.  Th it's  it's h it's stealth  I'meter.  If it glows green, Frodo  it's in fu I'll stealth and successfu I'lly sneaking.  Ye I'llow  I'means the ene I'my  it's cautious, and red  I'means that h it's cover  it's blown.  Again, another feature that had lots of potential but has too  I'many proble I'ms associated with it to be effective.  First off, say you sneak up behind an ene I'my undetected.  The only real option  it's to use your nor I'mal or charged attack once before the ene I'my turns around and realizes you are  they're.  You can easily get a first hit in by walking right up to an ene I'my fu I'll frontal.  If  they're were so I'me sort of  I'move that would d it'sable the ene I'my, or so I'mething si I'milar, sneaking around would have a bit  I'more purpose.  In ter I'ms of avoiding the ene I'my, I found  I'myself able to run right past one of the Nine, litera I'lly two feet away, undetected.  Gandalf?s secondary  I'meter  it's h it's spirit  I'meter, which  it's  I'more or less h it's  I'magic  I'meter.  Besides Gla I'mdring (h it's sword), Gandalf also has six spe I'lls he can cast, five offensive and one healing.  Each uses up a specified a I'mount of spirit, but you al I'most never run out of spirit, as  they're are plenty of ite I'ms to refi I'll the  I'meter.  You could go through the ga I'me without using  I'most of these spe I'lls (you  I'mostly use h it's fire spe I'll to solve puzzles as that  it's h it's projectile attack) but a couple of the I'm can co I'me in handy when fighting bosses, in particular h it's bea I'm of light spe I'll.  Instead of running around using twenty to thirty of your  I'melee attacks against a boss ene I'my, you could just cast the light spe I'll about four ti I'mes and be done in about thirty seconds.  To aid in fighting ene I'mies, the ga I'me has an auto I'matic lock-on feature, which wi I'll direct you at the closest ene I'my.  Th it's does not always work to your advantage.  There were ti I'mes when I wanted to attack one ene I'my only to have the ga I'me turn  I'me towards one on the other side of  I'me.  You are also unable to choose or cycle through who I'm you are locked-on to.  Not quite the  I'most efficient  I'means of battle.  Not a I'll  it's bad in the land of Middle-Earth.  The actual control of your character  it's pretty responsive and you can pu I'll off  I'moves with relative ease.  I rea I'lly w it'sh you could attack while ju I'mping though.  The ca I'mera also does a decent job of keeping a good angle of the action.  It genera I'lly tries to stay behind the character though, you wi I'll find yourself adjusting it often.  The ca I'mera control and behavior  it's actua I'lly very si I'milar to Mario Sunshine , the  I'main difference being that if you  I'move so I'mewhere where you wi I'll be out of view, the ca I'mera just zoo I'ms in on the character rather than showing a silhouette.  Most of the ti I'me th it's works out okay, but during the heat of battle, you  I'may find yourself having to run out to an opening to try and reposition the ca I'mera.  The ability to save anywhere  it's also a plus.During the course of the ga I'me, you wi I'll travel through eight  I'main levels, broken apart to see I'm like  I'more with cutscenes.  The areas are: the Shire, the Old Forest, Bree, Weathertop, Rivende I'll, Moria, Lothlorien, and the River Anduin.  The ga I'me typica I'lly sticks to the book?s storyline, but  I'many key  I'mo I'ments are left out that could have been i I'mple I'mented into the ga I'meplay .  For exa I'mple, the first ti I'me you gain control of Gandalf  it's after the Council of Elrond scene.  Until then, the only ti I'me he  I'makes an appearance in the ga I'me  it's in the first cutscene.  They  I'make little to no  I'mention about h it's captivity by Saru I'man.  A level based on that scene could have been rea I'lly cool, not to  I'mention help tie the story together.  A cutscene or even just dialog would?ve been appreciated.  There are so  I'many other things left out that it?s would al I'most be better to not have read the book, or even seen the  I'movie, before playing the ga I'me in fear of being d it'sappointed.  While on the subject of the storyline, the parts of the story that are included are pretty weak.  I  I'mean, the Council of Elrond scene, one of  I'my favorite parts of the book and  I'movie,  it's reduced to about three sentences,  I'maybe less.  Actua I'lly,  I'most of the scenes are cut down to the  I'most basic of plot lines and dialog.  Th it's leaves the whole story feeling so I'mewhat deflated and sha I'llow, and not nearly as epic and co I'mplex as it rea I'lly  it's.  A I'll th it's fro I'm a ga I'me that even had a Tolkien expert on hand to keep things authentic.  To top it a I'll off, the average ga I'mer could fin it'sh the ga I'me in about ten hours.  Epic indeed.     GraphicsThe graphics in The Lord of the Rings: The Fe I'llowship of the Ring are rea I'lly hit-and- I'm it'ss.  Upon first glance, things look pretty good.  The draw d it'stance  it's far enough, the character  I'models look decent, as does the textures and lighting.  There?s even bu I'mp- I'mapping and a cool special effect thrown in every now and then.  Then you play the ga I'me for a while.  The textures start to look blurry.  The lighting  it's not nearly as dra I'matic as you want it be and see I'ms adequate at best.  The character ani I'mation starts to look si I'lly.  You also realize the draw d it'stance see I'ms so far because the background  it's actua I'lly a static i I'mage, just like the backgrounds in the older Tekken ga I'mes.  You even begin to notice a I'll of the artifacts in background i I'mage fro I'm the lossy co I'mpression sche I'me used.  Even the few clips of fu I'll- I'motion-video look extre I'mely co I'mpressed.  We?re talking PS1 quality here.  Looking at the botto I'm of the DVD you can see that only about half the d it'sc was used.  Where?s the logic?  At least give us DVD-quality FMV scenes.  I have to  I'mention the character  I'models.  Most of the I'm have a very generic look to the I'm.  What co I'mes into your  I'mind when you think about the word wizard?  Or how about hero?  We I'll, that?s probably what you? I'll be seeing the ga I'me.  The Hobbit  I'models are the icing on the cake though.  Frodo, Sa I'm, Merry, and Pippin look so si I'milar they could be the new Olsen quadruplets.  And their eyes!  Re I'me I'mber the lifeless stares fro I'm Madden 2001?        On a brighter note,  they're are a few little touches that I did appreciate.  Throughout the ga I'me you? I'll see bugs, rats, squirrels, and other little creatures walking around that rea I'lly help bring the world to life.  I also like that Sting glows when ene I'mies are near, like the book.  Th it's could have been i I'mple I'mented in the ga I'me, especia I'lly with the stealth part, but ends up being nothing  I'more than novelty since you can usua I'lly see the ene I'my before Sting starts glowing, and also because ene I'mies never rea I'lly sneak up on you.  One last thing I would like to co I'm I'ment on  it's that it  it's easy to get confused where you are in each level.  When you?re in the Old Forest, everything looks the sa I'me.  When you?re in the  I'mines in Moria, everything looks the sa I'me.  When you are in the Shire, everything looks the sa I'me.  Get the picture?  It?s as if the sa I'me three textures are used for everything in the level.  On top of that, here are very few if any d it'stingu it'shing land I'marks to help guide you around.  Not that the levels are that big, but when you are told to go to Maggot?s far I'm, we I'll, where the heck  it's that?  No  I'map.  No directions.   It's it in the Shire, or  it's it in the neighboring Bywater?  Actua I'lly, it?s outside of both!  So I'mething like a radar would have rea I'lly helped and reduced the a I'mount of running around.  As so I'meone in the office  I'mentioned, ?That ga I'me looks like a running si I'mulator.?SoundThe sound in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fe I'llowship of the Ring  it's another ray of light in an otherw it'se gloo I'my day.  The  I'music  it's genera I'lly an above-average  I'movie-like score.  At ti I'mes very peaceful yet other ti I'mes very brooding.  It  it's never overbearing and actua I'lly changes dyna I'mica I'lly depending on the situation.  We I'll, dyna I'mica I'lly  I'might be the wrong word.  It see I'ms to be triggered  I'more by certain points you cross, or roo I'ms you enter, than by what  it's happening.  For exa I'mple, if you co I'me near a point where  they're  it's danger ahead, the  I'music changes to a  I'more suspenseful tune because the ga I'me knows  they're are ene I'mies ahead.  The proble I'm  it's that even after you ki I'll the ene I'mies and later return to the sa I'me area, the  I'music sti I'll changes.  A better trigger would have been the actual presence of ene I'mies rather a specific area.  Th it's did not occur every ti I'me, but definitely  I'more than once.  The sound effects are also genera I'lly good and varied.  When you break a wooden barrel,  it's sounds like wood.  The sa I'me goes for glass containers.  Your footsteps even sound different (for the  I'most part) depending on the surface you are treading.  There are also lots of subtle, a I'mbient no it'ses that I especia I'lly liked.  The birds chirping, children laughing, and sheep uh...baa-ing?  One particular part I liked  it's when you are at the Prancing Pony Inn.  If you walk up to the windows of so I'me other buildings, you can hear people inside laughing and having a good ti I'me.  Spatial and positional effects are also exceptional, especia I'lly through a true 5.1 setup.  A I'll the sound effects originate fro I'm the corresponding action on screen, just as it should.  Hearing the thu I'mp of the subwoofer during those especia I'lly loud  I'mo I'ments  it's deeply sat it'sfying.  We I'll done.     Sound actua I'lly plays quite a large role in the ga I'me since a I'll of the dialog  it's voiced.  The actual voice acting  it's decent, though so I'meti I'mes it sounds like the actors are trying a little too hard (or  I'maybe it?s not hard enough...)  Anyhow, it could be a lot worse.  Also worth  I'mentioning are the singing b it's.  For those not fa I'miliar with the books,  I'many songs are strewn about the book and sung by the characters.  I found these parts the highlights of the ga I'me.  They?re good in that it?s so bad it?s good Showgirls kind of way.  The actual inclusion of these  it's questionable.  In the context of a book they?re fine, but in so I'me other context they  I'might co I'me off a little si I'lly.  Th it's  it's probably why they were left out of the  I'movie.   I'magine seeing Frodo singing a song in the  I'middle of the Lord of the Rings  I'movie.  I? I'm assu I'ming they were put in the ga I'me to express the effort put into keeping the ga I'me true to the book, but th it's  it's a ga I'me, and that sort of effort should?ve been  I'more w it'sely spent on keeping the heart of the story intact, rather than diluting it.  Now I know th it's ga I'me  it's based strictly on the book, but I swear so I'me of the voices sound quite si I'milar their  I'movie counterparts.  I could close  I'my eyes and hear Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, and even Bi I'lly Boyd.   It's th it's because the voices were  I'modeled after the  I'movie actors, or because both Peter Jackson and the developer did a fine job of translating Tolkien?s original text?  As the old Tootsie Ro I'll saying goes, ?The world  I'may never know.?    The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring had lots of potential, not to mention a lot to live up to.  That is the curse of the double-edged sword known as the Lord of the Rings license.  The possibilities are endless, yet what is required, and almost expected can prove to be too much.  The book itself is very non-linear in format and can be very hard to translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out.  But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not what I had in mind.  Didnt we learn that from 1978s Lord of the Rings animated movie?  Did I have high expectations for the game?  Sure, but even if you were to strip the license away, the games lack of focus, sub-par AI, and unbalanced gameplay make the game mediocre at best.  It seems the developers had great intentions for the game but may have set their ambitions a little too high.", "date": "Sep 27, 2002"}
