I really, really do. I know, I know.  You're sitting there a Joe Reader, asking yourself how on God's green earth could anyone hate playing games and talking about them for a living.  I mean, it's such a sweet job. How could you possibly get to the point where you wished you were doing anything else? Well, let me tell you something kids: just like milk or the quiet guy in a group of renegade mercenaries sent out to save the world, games sometime go bad.  Be it that they, like the former, are just past their time for consumption, or the later in that they have some maniacal score to settle that involves betrayal of trust, torture, and a long drawn out story about how that kid you beat up in 2nd grade was actually their kid brother, the end result remains the same.  Someone has to endure something rather unpleasant. The sad thing is, in both situations, if someone would have been paying more attention, crisis could have easily been averted.  Enter Acclaim's latest ~entry~ into the wild, wonderful world of video game football, NFL QB Club 2001.  It's obvious that developer High Voltage had good intentions. It could also be said that just about any change to the series would have represented vast improvement over the train wreck that was last year's sad excuse for a football title. But much like my last attempt at dating, sometimes intentions and the reality of the situation meet with meet in an ugly symphony of self-destruction and post-traumatic depression, and even love can't saved a doomed relationship.  This game is just broken, and no amount of time or money is going to fix it.  Where to start.  Let's reminisce about the good times.  It does seem as if Acclaim hired some actual modelers to work on the players this year, and despite the frame-rate, the players don't look half-bad. They did a much better job with presentation this year, and I can honestly say that I was impressed on occasion with the sidelines which, though, lacking in detail, were animated enough to seem cool the first 20-30 times I saw them come to life after a play. There are a lot of cool animations, such as sideline tip-toes after a catch, diving catches, one handers, and tons of action from the secondary as well.  Yes, there were a few moments where I said to myself, ~Hrmm...that was pretty cool.~  But alas, These times were few and far between.  The rest of my time with QBC was spent sitting there wondering why anyone would subject themselves to such digital evil.  The control is horrible.  Just horrible.  Players are so caught up in motion capture at times that even the most subtle shifts in direction seemed to go completely ignored by the controller. Player swapping is god awful, and it is almost impossible to get control of the player you want on either side of the ball.  I can't tell you how many times I missed an obvious tackle because the AI was too stupid to fall on the ball-carrier and I couldn't ever get someone near the ball in time to make a tackle.   This situation is compounded by the fact that the animation system has some serious issues. The game seems to be missing about 50% of the frames needed for realistic animation, and player's limbs and bodies seem to skip around the field with reckless abandon.  This becomes a problem when you think you're going to accomplish one thing, and you end up doing another.  It reminded me a lot of playing Quake with about a 800 ping.  I'd move one way assuming one thing would happen, then without warning, my machine slows down, things stall for a split second, and there goes the ball-carrier, and I end up diving into the back of some random player's ass.  That would be all fine and dandy were I playing an Online twitch game, but this is an offline sports game.  Am I really supposed to accept this?  And it occurs everywhere.  Not just on defense.  The same could be said of trying to run the ball, where defenders jump all over the place, oftentimes run in place towards offensive linemen who are supposedly blocking only to ditch the nonexistent block to drop my guy on the line of scrimmage.  Or pass reception, where guys get stuck in overly-elaborate animations and you lose complete control of the catch itself.  I think this was supposed to look good, but unfortunately, it doesn't play too well.  The more I played this game, the more I felt like an observer, as opposed to a player.  QBC 2001 moves more like one of those old vibrating football games, where you set everyone up, turn on the power, and watch vibration carry out the action.  You've got a vague idea of what could happen, people jut around, and eventually everyone falls down, and the play ends.  Even when I put points on the board, or managed to stop a drive defensively, I never pumped my fist in satisfaction, or felt like I was ~winning.~  It was more like I had just cheated the game long enough to actually do something myself, and if anything, it just reminded me of how painfully ~not fun~ the rest of the experience was.  The sad truth is, the whole game seems to be lacking in this manner.  The play selection is really short-handed, with very little discernable difference (if any) between teams.  After getting a glimpse of the likes of Madden and 2K1, I can tell you right now that this game's playbook is just a joke.  On top of that, some key players are missing, which I'm guessing is a result of Acclaim's attempt to avoid competition by shipping early, but some omissions, like Randle at Minnesota, who isn't a question of slipping past a roster cut, last minute trade, or retirement...well...that's just sloppy.  Come on guys.  The engine may not be there, but the players? Ouch.  Even the camera seems confused.  Every now and again, it will zoom in on a big play, or make a quick cut, but it often meets with disastrous results. You can tell High Voltage wanted to do some cool stuff to make gameplay better, but it seems like no one stopped to realize that the ideas failed to work out on the playing field.  Like with passing. The camera cuts to the receiver early, which I'm sure was done so that you'd have more time to make a play on the ball. The problem is, the ball speed is all out of whack, and the camera doesn't pull back enough to see the ball coming, so you always end up struggling to time the catch, which is already difficult due to the aforementioned problems with animations. Then there's kick returns.  The camera flips around, but does so instantly, and cuts to an angle where it is impossible to see anything below the ball, and if you aren't in position to make a catch or a tackle, you're out of luck.  It just isn't playable, guys.  The same could be said of the game's AI.  These guys can really suck it up at times.  The secondary is incredibly weak, the D-line cheats, as do all the players making reads, and for some reason, people on both teams will fail to even attempt easy tackles near the end zone.  It's almost like they are programmed to give up. Player speeds are all basically the same, and I never got the feeling like I won or lost a footrace. The AI offense tends to call the same 3-5 plays, as well, and despite repeated triple coverage, would manage to complete the same pass to the same player, showing both painful play control problem (as I could stop plays even when I loaded up the side and played the ball all the way to the spot), and AI issues when a team like the Bucs or the Raiders couldn't stop a painfully bad throw. Lacking.  And that basically sums up the experience. No matter how hard QBC 2001 tried, I could have told you six months ago that it would fail to measure up to even last year's NFL2K. It blows my mind that anyone would believe such a title was worth releasing in light of the painfully evident fact that this game fails to do even that, much less live up to the legacies that are sure to be created by this year's efforts from EA and Sega. I would continue to rail on this game, but to tell you the truth, I kind of feel sorry for the series at this point.  NFL QB Club 2001 tried really hard to improve this year, but is so lackluster in so many aspects of execution that it pains me to see a company be so desperate that they feel like they have to release such garbage on the public, because it honestly has no business on a next-generation console.  Yes, it is that bad, and no, I'm not just saying that.  This game is not even worth a rental. With 2K checking in at $19.99 and the next round of titles mere days away, don't even kid yourself.  Brett Favre isn't that good of a Quarterback.  If you have to support the man, go buy a replica jersey instead.   -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC The question is, how desperate are you for an N64 football game right now? Hopefully not at all because NFL QB Club 2001 will more than likely disappoint. Unless you are a hardcore fan of the Acclaim football series, then I'd suggest putting this title on your rent list instead of into your shopping cart. While it does make significant improvements to last year's game, that alone just doesn't make it a good football game overall. My advice to Acclaim would be to simply drop the QBC franchise altogether and focus on its more promising baseball and first-person shooter games. It looks like EA's Madden NFL 99 is still the reigning N64 champ, but be sure to look back for our full review of Madden NFL 2001 when it finally ships. Chances are, either title will bring you more pigskin for your buck.", "date": "Aug 30, 2000"}
