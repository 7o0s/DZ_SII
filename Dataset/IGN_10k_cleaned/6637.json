Yet when RS took a long vacation in console land, it appeared to bring some bad habits back with it. It looks a heck of a lot better than your usual port, with a long list of fancy buzzwords and support for bunches of different resolutions, but it looks and feels like the heart of Rainbow Six is still sunning itself on a beach in Jamaica. I don't know who these guys are, and at the end of the day, I'm still not quite sure, since the mission progression of the console version has been inexplicably scrambled, thereby tossing into the air what story Rainbow Six Lockdown originally contained. It has something to do with terrorists doing naughty things, but the rest of it looks scribbled on the back of an envelope.     The frustration sets in early, when your squadmates continually block your attempts to get a good leaning angle around a given corner and pile up silently behind you just before you walk into a hail of gunfire. There are times when you'll need and want some space to back up, and you won't get it consistently unless you give your team a ~hold~ order to keep them out of the way. Bewilderingly, they will eventually tell you that they're coming anyway if you leave them idle for long enough, forcing you to hit the ~6~ key constantly. Somewhere in the game is the heart of a tactical shooter, but my team was far more of a hindrance than a help; sometimes they blinded themselves while flash banging a door, and sometimes they were just killed outright by the countless jack-in-the-box enemies hiding around corners and waiting for you to cross a spawn trigger.   Fortunately, your enemies are just as helpless, with poor accuracy, a lackadaisical attitude towards self-preservation, and an overall script model that appears identical to the console versions. Move around a little bit, duck and pop up randomly, utter a few repetitive situational lines, and get shot in the head. Because while they couldn't hit the side of the Goodyear blimp at point-blank range, I found myself to be the Jesse James of counter-terrorism, capable of the most impressive accuracy I've ever encountered in this type of game; another apparent holdover from the console control scheme. On the other hand, I have been playing a lot of Counter-Strike lately.     All I can tell you is that I have a lot of ammo and these guys go down like they're made of napkins. With the help of a mouse and keyboard, this new Rainbow Six becomes a passably entertaining shooting gallery. Sometimes you'll be rescuing hostages, other times you'll be infiltrating, but the rhythm is virtually the same no matter what your mission requirements are.    There's no need for stealth, partly because enemies will be pre-faced towards your position most of the time; and there's no need for tactics because you'll be quicker on the draw than 99% of the enemies you encounter. The only real threats I encountered were snipers (because they were difficult to spot) and RPGs (because they can take your whole party out at once). You can go through the whole game without making anybody stack up and clear a room. And since your team doesn't turn their heads away when the flash goes off, it's probably safer for these elite black ops personnel that they stay way in the back, out of harm's way.     As you work your way from one mission to another, you'll have the option to tweak the team's loadout. But since one weapon doesn't perform dramatically different from another, besides rate of fire options, it's almost aesthetic rather than tactical. To be fair, each weapon class performs differently, but the weapons within that class are distinguished more by how they look and sound than by how they actually perform. Most weapons have the option of adding a scope, laser sight, or suppressor, which adds some flavor, but this section of the game doesn't offer nearly as many tactical options at it seems.   Online multiplayer doesn't fare much better. Creating an ubi.com account is painless, but actually getting into a game is not. We had a puzzling amount of trouble connecting to a given match, and the game made no indication of what the problem was. It told us that we needed Punkbuster enabled for a few games, which is disabled by default, but that had no apparent effect on our success rate. This didn't stop the game from taking forever to attempt a connection, during which time you'll be unable to back out or do anything else with the game. I'd say it took about a solid minute to not connect. And of the twenty or so matches that were listed in the server browser, none had ping under 200. At the office, we're used to connecting at well under 100 in most situations.   We were able to get in and play a little bit, and there's nothing to really write home about. There are three modes: Retrieval, Rivalry, and Team Adversarial. Team Adversarial appears to be the more popular mode by an order of magnitude, judging by the leaderboards. Unfortunately, it feels like an early version of Counter-Strike. You can respawn thirty seconds after you die, and you don't have to buy weapons, but the pace and the theme is the same. You die quick, harbor suspicions of hacking, and wish you had a flamethrower. However, the weapon descriptions in the single-player side of RS:L are completely absent on the MP side. There's no indication of accuracy, damage, recoil or maneuverability, let alone a short blurb on the weapon itself.     Also, when you die, there's no follow camera. You have a couple spawn points to choose from and must stare dully at a mostly empty room for thirty seconds until you get the opportunity to play for another fifteen. Want to build a case against that suspected hacker? Want to see how the good players get good? Tough cookies, pal. But you can choose from a wide variety of weapons that might or might not be better than the one you were just using. If I were you, I'd stick to co-op on the LAN.Anyone who's become accustomed to the modern shooter should be able to sail right through this carnival ride, and it's really too bad. Rainbow Six is supposed to be tense and challenging. It's supposed to have compelling tactical considerations. If there is a story, it's told with the chapters in the correct order. Although RSL doesn't suffer audiovisually from having console roots, its gamepad-oriented gameplay keeps it from rising to the occasion.", "date": "Feb 17, 2006"}
