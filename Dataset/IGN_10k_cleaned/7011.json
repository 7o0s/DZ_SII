Skyzone's Ragnarok Mobile Mage isn't the perfect MMO connectivity game, but it's a major step in the right direction. You don't manage your PC avatar, but you can work alongside of it, adventuring in the same universe and transfer any financial gains from the smallest screen to your PC account.   In Ragnarok Mobile Mage, you are a young wizard with designs on greatness. However, before you can achieve your goal of fame and fortune, you must make a name for yourself to attract the attentions of the wizened mage that holds many secrets to power. To earn notoriety -- the good kind -- you must embark on a series of errands and quests for the people of Geffen. Only after you are a great mage do you stand a chance against Baphomet, the source of evil that threatens the land.   Ragnarok Mobile Mage sports a basic RPG set-up so fans of the genre will enjoy almost instant familiarity. You must venture out as an inexperienced, earning points by slaying monsters in the wild to gain levels. Level grinding is a pretty big part of MMORPGs, and it's essential in Ragnarok Mobile Mage, too. It's easy to track your growth via a very useful percentage rating next to your current level on the HUD. How you feel about grinding will have a severe effect over your feelings about Ragnarok Mobile Mage. If walking out into the woods to kill a few monsters and pick up items to sell in town, getting money and buying better weapons and gear from shops, and then going back out to start the cycle again sounds boring, then chances are this is not the game for you.   The town of Geffen acts as a central hub for all activity. In Geffen, you can pick up missions at Town Hall, sell gear and treasure at the Trade Shop, and buy weapons and other supplies at a basic store. Money is not necessarily easy to come by once you speed past level 10, as you must rely on beating boss monsters to make major hauls rather than clean up the itty-bitty threats that romp through the fields. If you play Ragnarok on the PC, you need to make choices about your money, too. Do you spend zeny, the currency of Geffen, in shops to keep on keepin' on in the mobile game? Or transfer it back to your PC character for use in the bigger MMORPG? Since I don't play the PC game, Ragnarok Mobile Mage is a standalone experience to me, not a means to an end. I was free to spend all my zeny to upgrade weapons and armor, becoming a skilled mage in just a few hours. I think the temptation to siphon zeny back to the PC game has the potential to really stunt growth within the mobile game.   Ragnarok Mobile Mage uses traditional RPG menus for equipping weapons, assigning hot keys (it's useful to put potions on * and magic spells on #), and managing your hero. You can save at any time via the pause menu, which is also incredibly useful for a mobile RPG.   The combat and exploration feels like a cross between classic Zelda and Ys. Your super-deformed mage wanders to monster-filled wilds, walking up to beasties and engaging not in turn-based combat, but real-time fighting by slamming on the OK key to swing blades or staves. Approaching a monster from the south can be kind of tricky, since your head is so large it obscures your target. You can luck out from time to time and land critical hits to cleave away significant portions of HP from your foes. Magic is a big part of combat and you need to keep elements in mind when casting spells. Fire-based spells such as Napalm Beat and Fire Bolt do more damage against wooden monsters like trees, for example. Other spells include Frost Driver and Stone Circle.   Each enemy monster has a visible HP bar that shows their current health, and the color of the bar itself indicates what kind of threat they are. By the third mission, for example, orcs had red bars, indicating they were big trouble, while the bees and Masterings that were once major threats now sported gray HP bars -- easy kills. Monsters get exponentially tougher as you progress, especially when vicious snakes and ghosts start filling up the wild. If you should die in combat, you are transported back to Geffen with half of your HP and spell points. Making sure you have a fat supply of potions (which come in many colors such as red, blue, and purple) is essential for survival.   I played Ragnarok Mobile Mage on a Sony Ericcson 710a. The game is incredibly bright and colorful complete with really nice sprites. The art style reminds me of classic RPGs for the NES and SNES. The HUD is small, maximizing the amount of the screen used for gameplay, but still easy to read. The music is short but good, but gives way to sound effects when you enter the wild for battle -- then you just get basic effects.  Ragnarok Mobile Mage is two different games to two different people. If you don't play the PC game, then this is a mobile action-RPG full of traditional level-grinding, which is good for a few hours of entertainment before the fun begins to taper off. If you are a major Ragnarok player, then this game serves an entirely different purpose: It's a zeny printing press you can work while away from the PC. And that's cool, too.", "date": "Jun 20, 2006"}
