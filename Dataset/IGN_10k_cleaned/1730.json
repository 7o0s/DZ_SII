Featuring enclosed fighting arenas and campy character designs, FV was a refreshing  and slightly weird  take on the 3D fighting explosion of the late Nineties. After the success of Virtua Fighter 3, AM2 decided to take another crack at the FV series, and introduced a Model 3-based sequel in 1997. This game appeared in Japanese arcades, then vanished without a trace, barely registering as a blip on American gaming radar. Three years later, Fighting Vipers 2 has finally appeared on the Sega Dreamcast. Was it worth the wait? No. Fighting Vipers 2 picks up where the original scraps of a storyline left off. The Vipers, a gang of juvenile delinquents who clad themselves in day-glo plastic armor, find themselves hunted down by a buff boss character named ~B.M.~ Being named after a scatological bodily function has turned B.M. into a raving lunatic, so he creates an enormous island prison, and dresses up like a member of GWAR so his opponents will die laughing before the fights even start.   The game features eleven initially-selectable characters, who come prepared for battle  each of them are ready to duke it out to the death in closed-off arenas, and are protected by two layers of bulky combat armor. The controls lean toward the 3-button Virtua Fighter system, with keys for guard, punch, and kick. The game plays like a jacked-up version of AM2's original fighting classic, with some major tweaks  while there's plenty of float damage to dish out on juggled opponents, hammering all three buttons while you're in midair results in an automatic recovery. Attacks are easily parried via the same button combination.   Armor also plays a major part in the game. As you beat down your opponent, his armor indicator will begin to flash, indicating that it's time to whip out a ~power move.~ These make your character flash for a few frames before the move connects, giving your opponent a split-second to execute a parry or a block. Oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be any side-stepping, so don't expect to be bobbing and weaving all over the arena.   Even though the combat zones are flat and squared-off, they're surrounded by chain-link fences, Plexiglas, or barbed wire. Each character can Irish-whip opponents face-first into these surfaces, or execute a variety of ~wall throws.~ If a character uses a power move to KO their opponent, they'll get smashed through the barricades, and into background objects. This adds extra spice to the conclusion of each match  you can send enemies flying off rooftops, or into pits of lava rather easily. And devoted gamers will discover that the game's fighting ~Track~ branches off at certain points, revealing new characters and bonus rounds.   One of the most spectacular ways to end a match is the Super KO  once you've lost your armor, you can execute a last-gasp attack that results in a knockout of apocalyptic proportions. Unfortunately, few of the Super KO's make any sense  for example, one of them shows your opponent flying into space, directly into the path of a ten-story nuclear missile that's about to destroy a space station. Another nonsensical KO shows your adversary falling into the middle of a cityscape that spontaneously explodes. Er, okay. (We'll assume it loses something in the translation).   In short, the underlying game system isn't bad... for a three-year-old game. Fighting Vipers 2 had some great ideas back in its time, but other folks have taken those concepts to a whole new level. To be honest, pile-driving an opponent off a ten-story waterfall in Dead or Alive 2 makes the wall-breaking of Fighting Vipers 2 seem positively blas in comparison  and the lack of 3D movement puts a major burden on the proceedings.   The other problem is that Fighting Vipers 2 is an extremely sloppy port. While the characters look pretty close to their Model 3 equivalents, some of the backgrounds are utterly hideous, utilizing cardboard cut-out sprites, appallingly low-res textures, and embarrassing special effects. We can't help but think that the arcade version held a bit more graphical punch  for example, in the museum stage, geometry-based objects such as the T. Rex skeleton have been replaced with flat sprites. It looks bad.  But all the polygons in the world can't patch the biggest chink in FV2's armor  the character designs. They're absolutely terrible. Guitar-wielding punk-rockers, skateboarders, latex S&M queens, overweight truckers  it's like a microcosm of the very worst Eighties kitsch. The only character who's halfway-likeable is Emi, a 12-year-old girl with an enormous teddy-bear-mech strapped to her back. Oh, and I'll let the following illustration speak for itself:      Oh yes  and let's not neglect the fact that the Super KO system is broken, depending on which character you use. Par example, Honey's Super KO is supposed to show your opponent getting eaten by a dinosaur. Unfortunately, somebody screwed up, and you see Honey and the fallen opponent levitating in front of the dinosaur, who takes a bite out of... nothing. It's a scripting bug, and it shouldn't have slipped through the cracks.  Finally, the list of extras is painfully slim. There's ~Random Mode,~ which juggles the order of the opponents you face, and a completely forgettable Survival Mode. The biggest cop-out, however, is the training mode. The Saturn version would walk you through each character's move list, allowing you to perfect each attack in sequence; the Dreamcast version offers no such courtesy, and you have little control over the actions of the AI drone.  In the end, Fighting Vipers 2 attempts to get by on the strength of its fighting engine alone. This is a straight arcade port with no frills  and considering how dated the game looks and plays, there should have been a lot more effort put into the conversion. If you must have a sub-par copy of the arcade game running in your home, then go ahead and import  but don't forget that there are plenty of other superior titles out there that are more deserving of your hard-earned cash.
