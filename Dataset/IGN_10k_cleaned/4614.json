{"name": "NBA Ballers", "name_review": "NBA Ballers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/02/nba-ballers-3", "text": "When the creators of NBA Jam and the original Spy Hunter get together to make a new basketball game, you know you're in for something special. Forget the bling, the mansions, and the NBA players, the real stars of NBA Ballers are its producers who've managed to piece together a game, that in concept sounds like a sure-fire rental. But they've thrown in so much game-recognize-game, jaw-dropping, drop-the-controller and pump-your-fists-in-the-air excitement, that NBA Ballers is a must-buy for both the hardcore sports fan and the casual jock who traditionally enjoys the Midway adrenaline series, including NFL Blitz and the aforementioned classic, NBA Jam.   E-40 might have already coined the term ballaholic, but you won't know its true meaning until the first time you bounce the ball off your opponent's noggin' then sky toward the rim to throw down the off-the-head oop. That's what NBA Ballers is all about: Humiliation and exhilaration all in one move. And the more you play, the more you learn how to demean your opponent, including jumping off of their chests for a monster stunt dunk, rolling the ball between their legs, and even tearing down the backboard to win the game.    And it's that type of one-on-one, trash-talking experience that really makes NBA Ballers rise to a level beyond most arcade sports titles. The best part is, even though the game sticks to the producers' arcade roots, you won't have to pay for it a quarter at a time.   It's time to ball 'till you fall. No tokens necessary.   The Graphics  Usually, IGN talks gameplay or features first, but damn, take a look at the faces, Steve Nash's hair, The Answer's tats, and damn, that's all I have to say. NBA Ballers delivers the best player graphics, the most detailed models of any basketball game...check that, of any sports game period. Forget Paul Pierce because that is the truth.   Granted, there are only two (sometimes three) players on the court at one time, but when you zoom in on a replay, you'd swear you're staring up the nostrils of Larry Legend, The Doctor, King James, and the rest of the NBA crew. The mo-capped movements and animations also look slick, as the team at Midway brought in some of the top street ballers like Hot Sauce and Trickz to perform everything from basic shakes to the celebratory taunts and dances.     If there's one fault in the animations, though, it's when you're running and try to turn. Your player kind of leans in the direction you want to go and often times dribbles with the opposite hand that you would want in order to protect the ball from the defender. It's a small thing, but it definitely looks strange.     The Game  Sure, the detailed graphics and the amazingly accurate faces are the first thing you notice, but if the game itself didn't measure up, well, then you could save yourself some money by simply gushing over our latest batch of screenshots. Unfortunately for your pocketbook, it's going to need to be a bit lighter, as NBA Ballers, like Jam and Blitz before it, is definitely a game worth playing over, and over, and over again. Only with NBA Ballers the game is far, far deeper than you'd expect.    The game features 60 NBA stars, from Vinsanity to K-Mart, and also includes 24 of the league's legends, including Chocolate Thunder, Magic, and Earl The Pearl. One thing that might anger some fans, however, is the fact that only 25 players are selectable when you start the game, so you'll have to work to unlock the majority of top stars like Kevin Garnett, Shaq, Kobe, and Melo.    You can unlock some players in TV Tournament mode by defeating a ladder of players in a series of games with specific themes (rising stars, MVPs) and rules (two-minute rounds, make it-take it), then receiving the payoff by unlocking the ladder's boss. You can also buy players with the skill points you accumulate through each game. A player like Steve Francis might only cost you 639,500 points, but someone like Dr. J will cost you 1,300,000. Other unlockables include movies from NBA Inside Stuff, Starbury teaching you how to perform a cross-over dribble, and even alternate outfits for each Baller so you will be able to play with Shaq in a golf sweater and Yao in a Hawaiian shirt.   Like previously mentioned, whether you've unlocked the full lineup or are playing with the default ballers, the player detail is simply incredible, and really adds to that impression, that sense of disbelief that you're in control of the movements of your favorite players, and in the end, that's really what it is all about. Though the movement of each player is individualized, giving each one a custom feel, compared to previous Midway arcade basketball games, the controls are a bit stiff at first, a tad slower than the arcade units we're so used to.     Once you get used to the controls, you'll be bustin' shots all over as each character comes complete with their own set of secret shots, street jukes, and recognizable player animations, including Vince Carter hanging from the rim with his elbow, Tim Duncan's bank off the glass, and Jason Richardson throwing down dunks from all angles and between the legs like the ~real~ slam dunk champ should (he was robbed!). To top it off, you're not just playing on any basketball courts, but in the backyards and even a recording studio, yes I said recording studio, of specific NBA stars. Head to Toronto and check out Vince Carter's Pinnacle Tower Penthouse, you can bring your game to the McGrady Manor in Windmere, Florida, or visit Duncan's Family Compound and battle the big man for some bling out in the Virgin Islands.    The Rules Rule  The rules for a normal game are simple: Best two out of three, first to 11 wins (win by two). And while that sounds like your basic b-ball title, it's the fast-paced moves and frantic nature of every contest that really sets NBA Ballers apart. Not to mention the fact that you can customize the rules just about anyway you want, including allowing goaltending, taking two points away from your opponent for every shot you make while on fire, and Free For All, which means no ball checks or clearing, whoever has the ball can score.    On offense, you can shoot, pass the ball to a member of your posse in the crowd and watch as he feeds you a crowd oop, juke, throw an alley-oop to yourself, dive for loose balls, or use a combination of the juice (turbo) button with the juke to pull off an Act a Fool move. These are the craziest plays in the game as a blur effect will hit the screen and in a two-second span you'll watch a canned sequence of your player passing the ball around your opponent's head, dribbling the rock between their legs, or even kicking the ball by them as you race toward the basket, catch the leather and race toward the rim to deliver the jam. Skilled defenders are able to actually counter Act a Fool moves with an accurately timed button press, and when this happens, it really gives you a strategic advantage.    But that's not it. If you want to further humble your opponent, you can choose to win the game using a special Juice House move, a move that, no matter the score, automatically gives you the W if you're able to successfully pull it off. What happens is this: The more street moves you make, and the longer the combination of moves you string together, the more you fill up your House meter by collecting a jackpot of points when you make the basket. When the meter is full, you'll hear the crowd start chanting ~Juice-House!~ and then you can attempt the Juice House move, an alley-oop to yourself that tears the backboard down and ends the game.    It becomes almost a chess match as the defender knows the alley-oop is coming and is trying to push, block, and steal his way back in the game before the rim is ripped to the concrete. If the ball is stolen, you can then do your own street moves, and if you score, your opponent's House meter will decrease and you will be safe from the game-ending playfor a little while, at least. Force your opponent to violate the 24 second shot clock, however, and his House meter will sink back to zero and you're back in the game.     Rags to Riches  And while the gameplay is the ultimate hook, and the TV tournament is a fun way to unlock a number of stars, it's the game's Rags to Riches mode, a deep single-player mode that focuses on bling, that really shines. In Rags to Riches, you create a baller from scratch using an extremely detailed create-a-player mode. From a fedora straight from 50 Cent's P.I.M.P. video to the ability to wear your hat tilted from one side to the other, it's like the producers took every fashion from Slam, The Source, and XXL and added them into the game. You want your player with cornrows and one pant leg up? You got it. Now throw in a watch, a diamond necklace, and some custom kicks, and you're ready to play.    Once your baller is geared up, it's time to distribute your attribute points. This is similar to most sports games, but once those points are distributed, that's where things get more unique. Depending on how you play the remainder of your games, that's how your baller evolves. It's like Tony Hawk's Underground that way. Shoot threes and make them, and the three point gauge will increase. The more you shoot, the better you get. Same goes for steals, blocks, dunks, lay-ups and every other skill coveted by the world of hoops. Your game and your player's talent levels actually improve depending on how you play. Finish all the challenges, and your player will actually have better stats than any of the NBA players and any other created player you decide to make, as the Rags to Riches characters will be given extra overall attribute points to work with as a reward for all of your ballin'.     And as you travel your way from Rags to Riches, you play your way up from famed Rucker Park, up against no-name street ballers, all the way up to the cribs of your favorite superstars such as Iverson, Shaq and Kobe. The more you win, the more ice, gear, and bling you accumulate, and with the money come the friends as you'll be able to bring sidekicks with you to your games who you can then pass to as you try to run away from the defender.   But life's not all about groupies, oops, and ice...if MTV's taught you anything lately, you know, it's about your crib. As you start winning games and earning money, you actually build your own crib piece by piece, from the swimming pools in your backyard to the Range Rovers and Escalades in the driveway, and once you complete the mode, your crib then becomes a playable level that you can not only play against your friends, but on the PS2, you can actually bring your crib online and see what kind of home court advantage you've really built.    Online play is exactly as you would expect. There are one-on-one games and tournaments, and from the brief time we spent playing it, the online play offers no significant lag, good response in the controls, and solid competitive fun for those who have no friends close at hand or at all. Folks with USB headsets can use them to talk all the trash they want, too.   Unfortunately, the wagering system that was originally planned for the game was nixed, so you won't be able to bet your friends, cars, or diamonds like originally promised. Another downer is the lack of extra modes. You can play one-on-one or even one-on-one-on-one, but there's no HORSE, slam dunk contest or other potentially cool modes that seem perfect for this type of experience and that would have made the game even better.    Some gamers might also find it difficult to play defense. You can swipe at the ball and even push your adversary out of the way, but five fouls lead to a free throw worth three points and possession for your opponent, so the rough stuff will cost you in the long run. That balances things out, but the game still seems more unevenly balanced toward offense than defense. It also costs you if you push your opponent toward the basket by accident. You might attempt to rip the ball, but end up shoving the shooter closer to the hoop for an easy dunk instead. So, among other things, if you go in thinking you can play NBA Ballers just like Midway's NBA Showtime and NBA Hangtime before it, think again.     One interesting ability that's been worked in, though, is the Charge button. No, this doesn't let you charge at your opponent, it sets your feet in order to help you draw a charge as the dribbler attempts to run past (through) you. It works every so often if you time it right, but since when does anyone try to draw a charge playing street ball? It's a calculated risk that may cost you more often then you think.   The other major complaints are the atrocious load times. The worst (and seemingly most senseless) is when trying to switch between divisions to select a player. It seems like it takes forever to merely go from the East to West, especially on the Xbox (strangely the load times are worse on Xbox, better on PS2). It might say ~hold up a sec~ on the screen, but it's anything but a second.   Sound  MC Supernatural is the voice of the game, from shouting out the plays to rapping on the soundtrack, but it's the beats and rhymes from the underground rap scene that will have you bobbing your head with baller delight. The soundtrack consists of 19 new songs, all related to basketball and livin' the life, all created specifically for this game. There's even a song from Phife Dawg, who heard about NBA Ballers and sent in a song on his own because he wanted to be a part of it. Definitely one of the best original soundtracks ever put together for a game.NBA Ballers is a game that anyone can pickup and play and have fun with instantly. But the more you learn about how to execute certain moves, the timing involved, the hot spots on the court, the secret shots, the more you realize how incredibly deep Midway's baller really is. This is one of those games that will instantly be inserted into your system the second any friend comes over to hang, as, like it's predecessors Blitz and Jam, Ballers  is one of those competitive, addictive experiences that will draw smiles from sports fans as well as fans of great video games.Midway Sports is back.Only difference is, the boomshackalacka has been replaced with bling-bling.", "date": "Apr 2, 2004"}
