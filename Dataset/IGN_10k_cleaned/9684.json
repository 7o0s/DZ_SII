But in the case of Cocoto Kart Racer, an utterly shameless rip-off of Mario Kart DS, I feel warranted to make an exception. Cocoto Kart Racer adds absolutely nothing to the kart-racing genre and makes no effort to differentiate itself from Nintendo's champion racing series. And what it does rip off, it usually does so poorly. Although the game plays okay and might even be enjoyable to someone unaware of the Mario Kart series, it offers nothing that Nintendo's game doesn't and is pretty worthless because of that.    The instruction manual gives a brief overview of the story and characters, but this information is completely missing in the game itself. Players are thrown into races without any hint of story or character info, which makes the nauseously cute characters seem pretty random and unimportant. Granted, story isn't the most important aspect in a racing game, but if you're going to bother coming up with some original characters at least give your audience a reason to care about them.    Players can race as eight different creatures, with four more unlocked through the game. Four cars can be selected for each character, although unlike in Mario Kart these are generic cars shared by everyone. The cars also don't seem to have any attribute differences, other than some of them being uglier than others. The twelve racers do have slightly different attributes but in a disaster move, this isn't mentioned anywhere in the actual game. The player will have to look in the instruction manual to find that Neruo has ~great acceleration~ while Baggy moves ~fat and sturdy but handles the road somewhat poorly.~ Wait, does that last one even make sense?    The Mario mimicry is pretty blatant in this game, especially when it comes to powerups. There are the orbs that circle the kart for protection (ala Mario's green shells), a fairy that zips down the track to take out the race leader (blue shell), a piranha that homes in on the nearest opponent (red shell), a fireball that is left on the road for people to drive over (banana peel), and a 'Storm Angel' that shoots all cars with a bolt of lightning from above, causing them to slow down (unlike in Mario, they do not shrink). They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but this game is downright plagiarism. Other powerups and on-track objects include the requisite speed boosts, slippery spots (tomatoes instead of oil) and slow-down points. There's basically nothing new this game brings to the table, although on the bright side I suppose this makes it easier to master.    Blatant copying aside, the game's not a travesty by any means. For one thing, velocity works pretty nicely. Characters continue to pick up speed as they race along, which makes weaving around on the track more difficult and enjoyable the longer the player is able to drive without crashing. Collisions are very forgiving, which could be seen as lazy programming, but it's fun to slip up hills and walls instead of just coming to a dead halt whenever the kart veers off course.    Controls are responsive, but are considerably shallower than in Mario Kart. For starters, the player is able to jump and skid, but these two abilities don't work well together so drifting and snaking isn't really possible. The developers copied everything else in Nintendo's masterwork; it's a shock they didn't copy their excellent cornering system. Most races involve just holding down the B button and occasionally tapping left or right on the +control pad, as opposed to the better kart racing games where the player is always actively doing something for that extra edge.      The levels are pretty generic and mushy-looking, with boring, unintuitive layouts. In Mario Kart, each level was constructed to tell a story of sorts  now you're in the yard, now you're in the mansion, now you're in the garden, and so on. In addition to keeping the visuals fresh, this also made every area and corner in the game easier to memorize and master. In Cocoto, the levels feature very few landmarks and recycle the same handful of details over and over, making them a confusing chore to stumble through.    The game offers a few different modes, although there isn't really that much difference between them. Players can either play through a Championship Race, in three different pots (the equivalent of cups), or play a single race on one of ten tracks (which is actually just five tracks with two variations of each). There's a multiplayer mode, which requires a copy of the game for every player  ridiculous when one considers how much data and graphics Mario Kart was able to stream to an empty DS. A Records option shows off best times in each of the pots but no additional info. Nothing else is offered in the game, not even a backstory or character profiles. Cocoto Kart Racer offers the absolute minimum to be considered a racing game and nothing in the way of additional modes or challenges.    The 3D art is pretty darn ugly in this game. Although there aren't many problems with slowdown or pop-in, everything has a very mushy, dark and hugely generic feel to it. The characters look like rejects from a Crash Bandicoot racing game and without any information on them beyond their name, they feel random and unimportant. 2D menus are very plain, essentially just basic text over an occasionally-scrolling background. This is a button-only game, even down to the menus.   On the one hand, Cocoto Kart Racer isn't an awful game. It's a simple, fast-paced racing game that should be easy for younger gamers to play. On the other hand, there's no reason for anyone to buy it because everything it does, Mario Kart DS does better. Even gamers who have utterly exhausted what Mario Kart DS has to offer will still enjoy replaying that game more than trying to find anything fun in here. The only thing unique in Cocoto Kart Racer is its mediocrity and lack of creativity. On the one hand, Cocoto Kart Racer isnt an awful game.
