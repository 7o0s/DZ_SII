It'll take more efforts on the part of the cutesy game makers to reach out to young girls early and teach them to play with the boys -- the same type of games that Nintendo has been criticized by the hardcore gamer really do a greater good by getting a gamepad in little misses hands before they're pushed away by grubby guys.Ubi Soft's Laura reaches out to the youngest of young girls in a simple adventure title. It's pink and it's undemanding, and it would make a boisterous boy sick with its simplistic girly nature. But it's also an easy introduction to videogames for young girls, and even has a few surprises that might make the little boys jealous. Features:Colorful Victorian era graphics and characters10 mini-games to enjoyInterfaces with other Ubi Soft games using the Ubi Key system.Only for Game Boy ColorPlaying as a child's take on the RPG adventure genre, Planet Interactive has a very uncomplicated and breezy feel to the gameplay. After Laura finds a gem in her basement and hears from here Grandfather that the diamond can bring mythical fairies into the world if it is surrounded by the positive energy of good deeds, the goodhearted girl is off to find people in need and give them her assistance. Along the way, she'll talk to the entire town and get to know every citizen, as well as leap into action to accomplish the tasks.There's never any danger to the challenges, and if Laura happens to make a mistake her first try, there's always another opportunity to try again. It's inviting gameplay like this that most children's game producers miss -- they like encouragement and they like to win, but kids need to be given fair opportunities and encouragement to play. Laura's breezy missions always keep young minds on their task -- every citizen may help her with the given task ahead, and on the easiest setting, there's even an arrow that steers towards the main goals.Not that there is no challenge in this game. It's just appropriate challenge for children, particularly inexperienced young girl gamers. The tasks send players to areas visited before, so it's sort of a memory puzzle to get to know the entire game landscape. It's funny to think about it that way, but most new game players just aren't used to more than one screen or exploring, so the way that the game eases young minds into the quest is very simple but effective. Once Laura is excited about her goal, she's dedicated to finishing it, even if it means exploring the entire game and talking to every townsperson, and though that challenge isn't really the call of the game, she will have to do a lot of talking and walking before her day is done.As in the adventure, the tasks are minimal but still help develop gameplay skills. When Laura pitches in to help a person, the game jumps into one of the ten mini-games. Some of these are platformer jumping challenges, others are mazes to solve, while others are easy kids challenges like a Simon Says or Dance Dance rhythm Jump-Rope game. These are games seen in countless other children's titles, and there's not much refreshing done with them to make them really spectacular, but the general control is always solid and intuitive, and the time limit is quite fair, if often too easy. Once the tasks are completed, they are available outside the main game for quick mini-game bonus rounds so young players can perfect their skills.Continuing to deliver some of the prettiest graphics on the Game Boy Color that is becoming a Ubi Soft trademark, the visual design here is lovely with little flash but nice class. Laura's land is made up of finely furnished Victorian era homes and lush gardens. Unfortunately, there's nothing moving in the background to help them come alive, but the game does other nice things to add humor and life with the people. The characters look much like their toys -- big rounded heads and plastic bodies, with sharp detailing and nice animation. They even have their triangle and moon-shaped faces in the conversation scenes. And Laura can talk to anybody in the town, including babies and kittens, who gurgle or make funny meows -- thought bubbles pop over their heads to tell Laura what they are thinking and what they want.Nobody's going to mistake a Playmobil Laura title for the next Zelda game, but Planet Interactive have done nice work on a small scale for this girl's adventure. Everything down to the flowery font show creativity and polish (although, for some reason, the small passwords are written very small -- oops). The title even works with the Ubi Key system, unlocking hidden levels in other Ubi Soft games like Rayman, so for those too afraid to play a game in a pink box, there's at least one reason to borrow this from your little sister someday. For any girl that's fallen in love with the Madeline books or movie, this game may have the same quaint appeal. Nice work for a young girls' game -- hopefully young boys will be treated just as kindly with their own Playmobil adventure, Hype: The Time Quest.", "date": "Dec 12, 2000"}
