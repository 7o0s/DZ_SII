The mobile maker's new strategy-RPG Rise of the Lost Empires is an engaging epic complete with accessible controls and excellent production values.   Tetris fans, you can skip this one.   Rise of the Lost Empires contains two separate campaigns, offering twenty full missions. You lay both sides of a great war between the human-lead Empire of Light and the Empire of Darkness, a foul troupe consisting of wretched (but powerful) orcs. The game adheres to some fantasy staples, such as sealing hellish portals and heroes with special talents, like swordplay or archery. Armies clash on narrow stretches of rock between rivers of lava and in frozen wastelands. Gameloft may not have a fantasy license like ~Lord of the Rings~ or Oblivion here, but the influences are obvious.   At the beginning of each mission, you must push into the unknown, exploring a map that is slowly uncovered with each step. You encounter enemy patrols that your hero can attack directly or leave to troops. Combat is as easy and moving a cursor over a desired target and pressing the action key. Your troops go right to work, obeying your commands. You can hang back and let the grunts handle the heavy lifting, but there are benefits to making the most out of your strong hero.   You pick up troops in the wild or generate them in the towns and cities you cultivate. You pick up treasure, earn experience, and outfit your hero with increased abilities and magic spells. Each mission has a definite ending point but plenty of variables, such as the kind of troops you employ or the hero you use.   Rise has a solid, but not overwhelming, resource-management element that works in the background of the action. When you discover razed foundations, you can rebuild from scratch. You must build out your communities to generate the necessary goods to fund the war effort, such as food. Creating and managing cities is easy, thanks to streamlined controls that let you effortlessly scroll through building menus or click back to your resource outposts no matter where you are on the map. As you play through an individual campaign, you unlock more and more options, including new troops such as demons, ballista, and archers. There are over forty different troops and buildings you can construct over the course of the game.   There's an easy eight hours of content in Rise of the Lost Empires if you really want to explore the game and see al the sights. Gamers in a hurry could probably shave an hour or two off that, but that still means Rise of the Empires offers great value to fans of the genre.   As always, Gameloft goes full-tilt with the production values in Rise of the Lost Empires. The digitized speech samples are an excellent addition. When you issue an order, your troops call back, letting you know it was received -- very cool. The graphics are great, too. Lots of eye-popping color and nicely detailed environments make Rise a real pleaser.Mobile isn't ideally suited for an epic strategy-RPG, but Gameloft proves it can be done as long as you understand the parameters (it's time to stop thinking of them as ~limitations~) of the platform. Make the controls as easy as possible, keep the scope of each mission within reason, but offer enough units/buildings to let gamers test out different approaches. This is far from a casual game, so if you're idea of a good time is Tower Bloxx, keep on keepin' on. But if you're a strategy or RPG fan away from your PC or Xbox 360, Rise of the Lost Empires is a great to-go companion.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
