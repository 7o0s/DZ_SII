The horror, anger, insane look, and a constant yearning to blow something to high heaven... Really, it's truly uncanny how Virgin, in its ~triumphant~ return to PC gaming, managed to so vividly capture all that I feel about Original  War into one neat little picture of a man howling out a battle cry. This time-traveling box of product that runs on Windows (you know the review is going places when you hear a description like that and it passes for good) is Virgin's real-time strategy effort in the company's new budget line of PC games. No frills packaging, no fussy price, but still a quality game, or so they claim anyway. Too bad the title's low budget nature is just a prelude to a markedly and confoundingly underdeveloped and poorly implemented product that attempts too much and delivers too little.   Foremost, the title being a planned budget outing from its inception means that every expense has been spared. Here we have a game that would make Scrooge McDuck proud. Of primary concern is the fact that there is no instruction booklet to speak of, which isn't anything bad when it comes to beat-em ups and Deer Hunter, but an RTS sans a technology tree foldout and accompanying material is a borderline sin. No tangible quick reference is really a much greater annoyance than any of us would have perhaps given it credit to be. A very comprehensive electronic manual has been provided (and is even accessible at any time during play), but it requires a game pause and just can't offer up the same unquantifiable pleasant familiarity of more traditional means (it's just a fancy readme, and everyone hates those). Original War's pervasive jump in and muddle your way through attitude is aggravating. And though it's a superficial complaint at best, I must ask, does an ugly as all ass menu really have to be a prerequisite to budget titles?  Budget smudget! We're all gamers, so we can handle lacking pack-ins, eh? On with the game... ~Premise? Concept? Design? Check, check, check. Oh, I know what we forgot! To try it all and see if any of it worked.~ Here comes the question of the day: Does melding and blurring the lines between genres necessarily guarantee a sure fire hit, or in some way automatically propel a game beyond those more traditional ones? Original War's answer is a resounding no. The game makes noble attempts to take the RPG elements of character importance and development and blend them with a twisted real-time strategy, but although the effort is commendable in spirit, the final outcome is so harshly lacking in so many departments that it actually hurts to play it.   For instance, objectives sometimes come across as being ill-thought out, or plain untested. In what I believe is just the second mission of the American campaign (when you live in the sewers long enough everything starts to stink) you are charged with ferrying a seemingly infinite supply of crates from one base to another (hundreds of them), but toward the end of the mission you are given new orders to abandon both camps. Hey, good thing I wasted like five minutes watching my guys automatically carry boxes back and forth, else I might have been forced to enjoy myself. And this kind of flagrantly poor production quality that manages to worsen over time is only the tip of the iceberg -- something that's really sad considering the initial, underlying design of Original War was also kind of neat.   In the near future mankind will learn to harness the time traveling powers of a mysterious device discovered during World War II. Never you mind why this, the most advanced piece of technology known to man, is propped up in the middle of nowhere protected only by a small collection of guards and a piece of plywood that acts as a makeshift bridge over a stream. With this device, the Eon, humans can travel on one-way trips back through time and alter history as they see fit.  The problem is that the material needed to power this machine is only found in Siberia for the American campaign, and only in Alaska for the Russian (just the beginnings of the two single player campaigns give an immediate indication of some bad mojo alternate timeline happenings). So, each campaign starts with that government making plans to use what little fuel they have for the Eon to travel millions of years into the past and relocate the ore to more friendly territories (Russians want to take from Alaska and put in Siberia, Americans want the exact opposite). It gets really crazy from here on in.  Who would have thought that a simple trek to prehistoric times to gather up some ore that powers a time machine would so quickly degenerate into chaos. Suffice to say the game plays a lot on the paradoxes and causes and effects of time travel, which is cool. Heck, even some of the cutscenes are cool and original (the American one being a developing sketchpad, and the Russian being video comprised of monochrome ASCII characters). It's a shame then that the evolution, delivery, and progression of the story are so poor that any shred of enjoyment to be had in Original War will get sapped out just as quickly as a player's general interest in the game. The flagrant disregard for timeline cohesion and the training of prehistoric ape men by the military are just two of many, many problems.  Some redemption in the category of story comes from conversational choices that are spread throughout the game (most are of a WingCommander two choice variety and not a Baldur's Gate multiple outcome dialog). These instances allow players to take a more active role in Original War. The design is still predominately pass/fail, only now with a slight twist. This is one of the few aspects where the melding of genres has actually worked for the betterment of the game. An example of this would be the very beginning of the American campaign. While standing at the brink of prehistory, before you even enter the Eon, you're given the option to either go on through or back the hell out. Being the super soldier that I am, one none too reassured by the crappy piece of plywood bridge leading up to the carelessly guarded Eon, I humbly declined to go and was treated to a sketchpad cutscecne. Nice touch, I thought. Sure, it was ultimately fleeting, but still nice.  Barely excelling past Tiberian Sun, and even perhaps falling a bit behind at times, though also better at others, the game is graphically a bland, mixed bag. The characters are large and the vehicles cartoonish, more akin to StarCraft than the C&C brigade. The ground has a painted, almost stroked quality to it, and subtle touches like the smooth turning of vehicles and the crunching of grass beneath units add to the appeal, but the visuals are strangely and unshakably reminiscent to Ultima VIII. It's a kind of colorful but almost blocky look (perhaps a lot of the memories are coming from the palette in effect). Characters move chunkily and stiff, and most of the art portraying them is freakish and poorly done. The game moves decently, but is not the pinnacle of hand drawn art on the PC.   You can't knock a game for being 2D in light of more advanced 3D titles, but you can critique it for offering so little as far as the genre's aesthetics go. Still, Original War remains passable in this respect despite overly static, sparsely populated environments (so I dig the bending grass and flowers, I have a florist fetish, what do you want?).   I did take issue with some of the general level design that seemed like a lot of stretches of land were pointlessly included just for the sake of being included. In typical RTS games needless and fruitless paths are usually obstructed or limited so that you don't waste your time walking a character two miles into a dead end. But I found that too often in Original War was I exploring a long, narrow plot of land that would eventually lead to nothing at all. It's an annoying inconvenience, especially given some of path finding routines that require a good five or six reassurance clicks to get a guy moving.  Sound and music are really, really, astonishingly bad. The terrifying amalgamations of Russian techno/polka, weird Egyptian themed chanting that even Xena wouldn't have on her show, and other horrific beats that sound like cheap knockoffs of WingCommander 2 midi are unbelievably bad. Honestly, coworkers flocked around my desk in disbelief as I played. I actually had to prove to them that the music was indeed emanating from the game by cranking the volume and playing a bit. Yeah, the music is kind of dynamic (it goes from mellow to fast when action arises), but that's like saying you went from a Gremlin to a Yugo... Way to improve, dude.  And still worse than this are character voices that range from frustrating to aggravating to want to go kill the recording studio guy. Having to put up with poorly done stereotypes of Russians, Americans, and Arabians is one thing (I work at IGN, c'mon), but doing it all the damn time is another. Every voice in the game is so blown out of proportion that you'll actually tune them out after only a few missions. Compounding this aural desecration is the fact that characters often blurt out phrases with no reason or cause; obviously a queue from RPGs. But, even Boo from Baldur's Gate started to bug after the fiftieth hour and he was done well. Just imagine a level of incessant yapping three times as great with voices ten times as bad and you're beginning to get Original War's idea. Sure the acting sucks like only Freddy Prinze can, but tell you what, throw some cursing in there a few times a mission and it won't be all that bad. Heck, if it still stinks of mule, just toss in a lot of pointlessly demeaning sexist remarks. That always works! Hooray for the writing and acting. I can almost feel the late, great, famed film critic Gene Siskel rolling over in his grave.  It's clear that genuine, albeit misguided effort has been put into the gameplay department. Unlike traditional RTS titles, Original War places real precedence on preserving the lives of your mates because there is only a finite supply of them, and each is unique; lose one and she's gone for good. This RPG inspired twist to the genre could theoretically add substantially to the gene pool, but winds up in the same good on paper bad on CD rut as the rest of the games many categories. It's nice that your characters are important. It's not nice that they die as fast as flies. What's even worse is that, aside from them being irreplaceable individuals (still annoying as all hell expendable cannon fodder though), a unit lost means an investment down the tube. Again, like an RPG, a kind of experience point system is in play, so the higher up the ladder a unit crawls, the more likely it'll be you'll reload once they die (which happens about every four minutes). And even the actual management tracking or character development is wrong. Looking after a few handfuls of units quickly gets tiresome and tedious. They then wind up important to the game, but not to you, the weary soul tired of the game's emphasis on preservation, but contradictory play.   There's plenty to do in combat, and a bit the way of strategy. Soldiers can enter and operate vehicles; take hold, refuge, and defensive positions in buildings; and even do things like stand or go prone. The fog of war also has a nifty way of only revealing portions of the map that aren't obstructed by objects relative to a unit (hiding behind buildings is possible). All of this thought amounts to nothing upon first engagement in actual combat. It'll be then that you realize that all need be done on your part is clicking a unit to attack and passively watching your own move to the necessary distance and bombard them with little reprisal. And if there is reprisal, the ape men aren't hard to beat.   Like other games, you can set waypoints, behavioral patterns (flee, patrol, eat soup, whatever) and manage teams (this time majorly through a troublesome window interface I strongly disapprove of).  Original War's ideology is sound, but unlike Battle Realms or Conquest: Frontier Wars that both take new approaches and slants on the genre and use them to craft play that enhances the game, Original War's reliance on sloppily strung together portions from other areas of PC gaming add nothing appreciable. It seems that in developing OW someone forgot a very important principle of game development... You have to make things work before you put them in. Throwing a Chevy big block onto a skateboard may sound like a good idea, but it's really not going to go far.   A multitude of multiplayer options exist, but when the fundamental gameplay aspects are as mediocre as this, no amount of online play is going to save you. There is plenty to keep a player entertained when going at it with buddies or nameless denizens of the net (provided he or she is entertained to begin with), but the exclusion of a skirmish mode is egregiously unthinkable.  If Original War is any indication of the future of strategy games or the paradigm shift in PC publishing today to more embrace the budget, then boy howdy, I really don't want none. The RTS genre is as flooded as ever on our platform and most come far better than this. With little to no exceptional or even redeeming value in any area, and in fact, only sporting a lot of characteristics it claims as distinguishing that ultimately wind up being detrimental, Original War finds itself lost amidst a sea of noteworthy and otherwise respectable titles that do so much more, so, so much better. Avid players of the RTS may find its concept novel and its ideology intriguing, but nothing aside from a purely scientific curiosity will exist to warrant purchase or play.  Just go buy StarCraft...again.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
