A good handful of Game Boy Advance titles fall under this category: a publisher scores a license, and commissions off GBA development for a ridiculously low budget and schedule for maximum profits...quality be damned. But what I can't understand is the strategy behind XS Games' Thunder Alley, a game with possibly the sloppiest game design ever conceived for the handheld. The game was obviously produced on the cheap, but it has no license, no familiar branding, and only a $20 pricetag to encourage a purchase. There's absolutely no way the development studio and publisher can't see the garbage quality of this racer, and if the two companies continues to crank out games like Thunder Alley, don't expect to see XS Games or Pronto Games branded on future gaming product. Features Four tracks Eight characters  Right from the start it's clear that Thunder Alley was developed ~on the cheap.~ Not only does Thunder Alley recycle the exact same character select screen from Pronto Games' last GBA title, Ten Pin Alley II, the racing portion's graphics and graphic engine are recycled from Sennari Interactive's rendition of Driver. That raycasting engine has been ripped out of Driver and placed in Thunder Alley's racing design...though ~design~ is definitely phrasing things loosely.  Sennari's graphics engine still retains its smooth framerate in Thunder Alley, but the graphic artists responsible for the textures of this racer obviously had no idea how to work within the confines of the technology. Each the four tracks (yes, only four) features ~wall~ textures with a transparency effect to make these walls appear less harsh and rigid. Apparently, these graphic designers didn't realize (or care) that the transparency won't actually show any object behind it. So, when the track curves around sharply to the left or right, there will be invisible walls obscuring the view of where the track's actually going, since players will see the blue sky instead of the actual objects that are supposed to be displayed. It's impossible to describe this effect without visual aid, so be sure to watch the videos to understand what this actually means. It's worth seeing for a laugh. It's like something ripped straight out of Time Bandits.  As far as control goes, the Driver engine definitely comes in handy. Sennari's game already produced a good amount of car handling and balance, and it's clear that Thunder Alley's using this bit of code as well. But for whatever reason the programming team decided to leave in the handbrake control, which is absolutely useless in this racing game. There's not a single place on the track where an instant 180 degree spin is necessary or helpful; even when the race is over the action ends abruptly, so players can't even pull off a victorious spinout if they wanted to. Even if you could overlook all of the bad track designs and graphic glitches, you'll see everything the game has to offer in a single hour of play: there are only two modes of play with only four tracks and no way to record best times. That ~budget~ $20 pricetag isn't exactly filled with value, folks. I fear that as more Game Boy Advance systems enter the hands of the mainstream, the more frequent crappy shovelware games like Thunder Alley will become more common in the market. This racing game is just downright terrible, with inept programming and graphic design all throughout its production. There's no doubt that is was produced on the cheap, but that's just no excuse for its existence, and it's unexplainable why retailers would even pick this game up for sale in the first place.", "date": "Jun 21, 2004"}
