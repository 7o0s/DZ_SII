This year they have a much better choice, starting with Madden NFL 99. This year's version of EA's premier sports franchise is a magnificent step above last year's effort, but unfortunately it is not without its faults.  As things stand now, no other football title on the Nintendo 64 comes even close to this game.  Because of its detail level (in graphics, statistics, and gameplay) Madden 99 covers the NFL as good as any console gridiron game, setting up a high standard for QBC to match.  The Facts  Full NFL Licensing.  Franchise Mode  Running in High-resolution mode.  Play editor.  110 Current and Classic NFL Teams  New Tackling animations  Full season stats, schedule and standings.  Save Custom Teams -- Save created players, roster changes, and audibles to memory card  Rumble Pak compatible.    Gameplay Madden fans will feel very comfortable with this game.  The control scheme and playing style is right in line with previous efforts even though the graphics have been completely overhauled.  And apart from the sound, this year's version does not have that 'rushed' feeling that slightly marred last year's game.  While the playing style will be familiar to Madden vets, a few new additions spice up the mix. The running game has been improved with better blocking and more moves for the running backs. Unfortunately the blocking is a little weak and the company decided to show off its new flashy tackle animations a lot in this mode, which means players lose a little control at the end of runs. For example, Madden finally has wrap tackles that look nice, but once a big tackle animation starts, players have no way to break out of it.  The use of so many tackle animations affects another part of the running game, player momentum. When a big running back like Natron Means heads straight downfield, the collision should be tremendous, which it usually is in this game. However when a smaller back like Barry Sanders skirts down the side of the field a close tackle by diving defender should be far less momentous, but in Madden 99 these tackles are just as big.  As a result the running game consists mainly of crushing tackles for short gains or losses and the occasional big break for enormous yards.  The passing game has changed little except for new pump fakes and some nice catch animations that make fingertip catches look as amazing as they do in real life. Madden is approaching a point where the passing game should be seriously examined because it is looking stale, but compared to anything right now on the Nintendo 64, it is the best.  If you want to win, don't worry about reading defenses and looking for open men, Madden doesn't reward that. Instead pick a receiver before the play and pass quickly. Doing that gives you a better chance at hitting your target.  Beginning players will be happy to note that EA added an optional one-button control scheme to make it easier to get into the game  but most players will opt for the traditional control configuration for a much better passing game. A directional passing mode that is similar to NFL Blitz has been included, but it tips the other player off on where you are going to pass, so it is not very effective in two player mode.  The defense plays much smarter than last year and finding money plays is a far more difficult task.  It also seems that the clock management of the offense is far smarter than last year's version, running down the clock when you most desperately need the ball. This all makes for a more enjoyable experience for the hardcore football fan. The multiplayer gameplay is pretty close to the same as last year, but thanks to the blocking improvements you can actually run on a friend and be at least partially successful.  Perhaps the best new addition to Madden 99 is a franchise mode that lets you play through several seasons as one team. This adds significant longevity to the title as players can play through a season, draft new players and pick up free agents and hopefully build a dynasty that stays on top of the league year after year.   Last but not least, Madden's newly reclaimed NFL license enabled EA to include more than 100 past and present NFL teams, all 30 current NFL teams, 85 all-time and super bowl teams and loads of secret teams. And then, of course, there are the team players to think about, which EA can finally answer: ~It's in the game.~  Graphics Next to defensive AI, graphics are another high point of this title.  The 640x480 high resolution graphics are a thing of beauty, especially in the replays. Player animations are nothing short of amazing, and the wide variety of tackles keep the action from getting boring.  One problem, however, the gorgeous graphics come at a cost, with framerate drops and slowdown from time to time. Although you will probably be annoyed by it in the beginning, it does not distract from the overall game very much. The sprite linemen are still painful when they're close to the camera, but that's a small sacrifice for a better framerate. The stadiums are all recreated faithfully and beautifully, but EA needs to work on the sky textures and the little extras for next year's version -- everything looks a little too clean and too barren (a possible side effect of the switch to hi-res). Nevertheless, Madden 99 is a big step up for console football.  Sound The sound effects are pretty good and the crowd noise adds to the excitement, but compared to other EA titles, Madden 99 is entirely too quiet. What happened to the awesome surround sound from the FIFA series or new voice compression techniques to include more speech? (We suggest EA give Factor 5 a call and use their compression  Star Wars fits about an hour of speech into a 16MB cart). There is the occasional commentary from Madden and Summerall, but it's just not enough to make it even remotely resemble TV coverage or some of the better soccer efforts out there. I was not a big fan of either Madden or QBC last year because I felt theyboth gave Nintendo 64 owners a sub-par football experience compared to thePlayStation. But this year the Nintendo 64 thumbs its nose at the PSX witha football game that will have those pixelated PlayStation pansies cryingin their beer once they realize how good Madden 99 for the N64 is.  Eventhough it isn't perfect, it's one heck of a game.", "date": "Sep 26, 1998"}
