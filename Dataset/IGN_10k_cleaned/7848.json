On the one hand, the Wii version looks absolutely horrible to anyone who's even glimpsed the game running on a 360 in hi-def. On the other, it lets developer Treyarch bust out a few new ideas - something the full-fat 360 game, while excellent, was perhaps a little short on.   The basic game here remains pretty much exactly the same as the 360 title - ie. like CoD2, but a bit bigger and more cinematic - but you'll notice graphical effects that have been stripped out here and there. Most of the good ones, broadly speaking. As with its big brother, this is solid shooter action right through, and what it lacks in ideas compared to CoD2 it makes up for with bigger firefights. What's fresh on Wii though, and it kind of had to be, is the controls. Treyarch has stuck pretty much to the obvious solution suggested by the Wii controller, aiming your gun using the Wiimote and the nunchuk to move around. Unless there's some huge intuitive leap we're failing to make here, this is set to be the model for most FPS games on Wii - it certainly is for big-hitter Metroid Prime Corruption, due next year. Treyarch just has the privilege of going first with its version.    So, can a pointer and a wand compete with the battle-hardened two-stick control system we've all been using since Turok? The one word answer is yes. While the new control system will, at first, have hardened FPS freaks swaying around dizzily looking at their shoes, or inadvertently firing their rifle at comrades, it settles down to being pretty smooth - like, you'll probably cop an earful of abuse during the training, but come up smiling during the first level.   You do almost wish you had a third hand to begin with but it becomes pretty intuitive, 'nudging' the edges of the screen with the Wiimote to look around. Better still, it adds an actual physical sense of your weapon to the jaded old FPS mix, which is pretty neat. It really doesn't matter that the Wiimote isn't shaped like a gun either - you do feel just that bit more 'there' while you're pointing something at the Germans.   As with anything new, it does snatch away a bit of your confidence. You'll find yourself looking down the butt of your rifle for a careful aim more than you do in a stick-controlled shooter, with the end result that even the most gung-ho of charge-in-and-use-your-rifle-butt merchants will be turned into a sniper.    The wave-the-nunchuk-to-reload system isn't perfect, either; it's far too easy to think you've not done it, wave it again, then find yourself changing back to your rifle in the middle of an intense face-to-face firefight. The positioning of the grenades on the direction buttons on the Wiimote could have been better too, because after a bit it's just so much hassle feeling around for the right button that you just find yourself getting on without grenades at all.   But hand the controller to someone who hasn't wasted years of their life playing FPS games and it's a different story. In our entirely unscientific study group of one non-gamer, the control scheme was pronounced 'pretty easy to use' - praise that you don't often hear from non-gamers about whatever hardcore FPS you happen to be ploughing through. For our non-gamer, this felt like a Wii game first, a shooter second and that was a good thing in their opinion.      Of course, that applies double when it comes to the game's most significant addition over Call of Duty 2 - the Battle Action moments, which take you out of shooter mode and into a series of integrated mini-games, which are as diverse as Wii Sports and include anything from a boxing-type struggle for a rifle to driving across the battlefield using the remote as a steering wheel.   Like the same parts in the Xbox 360 title, they're not always smoothly integrated into the game. For example, they're often introduced by some clunky line of dialogue that might as well say, ~Mini-game ahead!~. Wii adds to that by its very nature, given that the rifle-wrestling sub-game is so energetic you'll actually work up a sweat before going back to the normal, much calmer game.    As ever with mini-games on Wii, enthusiasm is rewarded over precision, which all adds to the fun, but sometimes it does strike you as weird that you're playing this fun, energetic party game which has the end result of you smashing someone's skull in with the butt of your rifle or having an enemy machine gunner blown to pieces with a tank shell.Hand on heart, if you had a 360 and a Wii in your house and this game on both, you'd probably complete the game on 360. It's not just that the environments look pretty vile on Wii - water becomes a grey slab, or vanishes entirely - it's that the animations have been cut down so much that people you've shot practically disappear. And there's no multiplayer here at all. But if you don't have another console, this is actually pretty neat stuff and well worth a look. Plus, it's a total triumph that the all-new control scheme evident here is this intuitive.Just think back to how clownishly inept using mouse-look for the first time on Quake made you, or the dizzying horror of trying to use a stick to look on console for the first time: the fact that Treyarch has, from a standing start, freed up our second stick and put the gun in our hands for the first time, is pretty good going. All we need now is a shooter built from the ground up for Wii and then we'll really be motoring.", "date": "Dec 18, 2006"}
