It's not that it's a bad game. It's just that, surrounded by classic hits and obscure curiosities, it's just the most unremarkable of the bunch.   Soccer was one of the last NES black box games, shipped to retail in that distinctive dark packaging with the oversized pixel art. It was early 1987 when it made it to America, and the NES had been available on domestic shores for about a year and a half. Just a few short months after Soccer's arrival, Nintendo would revamp their marketing strategy and product images with a major new push, fueled by The Legend of Zelda's golden box and cartridge. Soccer, then, only had a few months to find an audience before being rendered visually obsolete on the store shelf  it wasn't much time.   And Soccer didn't quite achieve its goal of finding favor with the fans. Ask anyone what their favorite old NES game was, and you'll probably never hear ~NES Soccer.~ Not that many people played it. Not that many people owned it.          A few new fans were found when Soccer appeared as an obtainable emulation in Animal Crossing on the GameCube, but even then its acquisition was made difficult  gamers had to seek out a special code on a Nintendo of America website and enter it into the game to unlock the title.   Revisiting it today on the Virtual Console, we can see that the game does have a certain goofy appeal. Its music is bippity-boppity and upbeat, and playing it feels amusingly ridiculous. This isn't as strict and focused a simulation as some other early NES Sports Series titles  only five fielders form each team, for example, supported by a keeper in the net. But the execution of the design is charming and perfectly captures the retro gaming vibe.   Two players can get in on the action, selecting any one of seven teams and taking to the pitch to out-foot each other. If you play alone, there's a difficulty chooser that can increase the challenge.   Control in Soccer is as simple as can be, with really only three things to do  move, swap your active player, and kick the ball. An arrow appears in-between the opponent's goalposts to let you line up your shots on approach, and just a few minutes' worth of practice is enough to become proficient at scoring with consistency.   A final bit of trivia  Soccer was one of Intelligent Systems' first titles. You may know the name, as the Nintendo internal team later developed such hits as Metroid, Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Wario Ware. If it took a less-than-challenging and admittedly shallow sports design to get that team going and ready them for the future, then I'll happily applaud the effort. Soccer was a step on the path to some of Nintendo's very best series.  So Soccer has a bit of a legacy, and is still fun in its way. But it will still lurk in the shadows. Hidden behind the bigger names, the bigger franchises. I'll stick to my guess that it will fall to last place in the Wii Shop ranks, but those who do decide to download it may find this quirky release to be an amusing addition to their Channel array.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
