This is especially true when referring to Shadow Hearts: Covenant, which is easily one of the most enjoyable, humorous, and surprisingly deep role-playing games of the last several years. The good news is that XSEED's awaited follow-up, Shadow Hearts: From the New World does capture some of the same magic that made Covenant such a joy -- quirky characters, a great battle system, and a strong propensity towards humor. The bad news is that the game doesn't do any of that stuff nearly as well as before.   Of course, that statement is a bit loaded considering that Covenant accomplished almost everything in doses far beyond the norm. Its storyline, production values, and quality of battles were top tier in every respect, and living up to that standard is difficult indeed. To its credit, though, returning developer Nautilus has definitely tried to keep series fans happy with an assortment of bizarre and atypical character types that you've likely not experienced (unless you played previous installments).   Like your characters to be a little  Take the gay biker couple that runs the item store known as ~Just Us Guys,~ for example... I'm willing to bet that you've never seen that in a game before. You probably haven't met someone like Hilda either, a schizophrenic magic-using weirdo who changes body shapes and personalities depending on the number of calories she eats. A fire-loving mariachi, a dim-witted ninja, and a talking cat that doubles as a mobster and an actress have also been included.   But the personalities above are just supporting characters to a much bigger picture. Amnesiac teenage detective Johnny Garland and his platinum blonde shape-shifting Native American cohort Shania are the real stars of the show. Allied together for multiple quests the pair sets out with friends to, among other things, solve the mystery of a fire that killed Johnny's parents, locate an evil woman that destroyed Shania's village, and figure out what a penguin-like professor from Boston is really up to. It's an intriguing mix of stories to say the least, and is easily the most eccentric reinterpretation of the 1930s I've ever seen.   Poor Johnny is in for one heck of a bizarre ride.  When told, this story actually works pretty well. Other than a few short cameos by some returning characters, the plot in From the New World stands alone and allows new players to come in without having to worry about past situations. There are even a couple of really surprising plot twists that I didn't see coming (which is rare for a guy that plays just about every RPG out there), and a good portion of the dialogue and character interactions strike a solid balance between humor and seriousness.    Unfortunately for all of us, the story in From the New World doesn't take center stage very often and runs into untimely pacing issues. The beginning, while lengthy, is difficult to get into and doesn't get going for an hour or two after you've already recruited your first three characters. From that point on, the narrative is great and boasts several of the goodies mentioned earlier... until you reach the middle part of the game. It is then, that for some inexplicable reason, Shadow Hearts' suddenly becomes a battle-heavy dungeon crawler and provides players with few motives for their actions and long gaps between explanations. In fact, several story points are never really resolved at all and it's obvious that the writers had another sequel in mind to answer them. Still, there are some truly entertaining, almost ~blockbuster~-like moments to enjoy in here.   This uneven storytelling isn't helped at all by the lackluster voice acting either. Unlike most recent RPGs, which have done a good job of creating believable personalities through its actors, From the New World breaks them down into stereotypes. It would probably have been better to include the original Japanese voice-overs with subtitles instead, which the game doesn't do. Luckily, the excellent CGI cutscenes and superb soundtrack convey a lot of the game's emotion a lot better than its actors can -- which is why all the best moments in Shadow Hearts happen when you're reading and not watching.   Expect high-end cutscenes and music to match. Of course, Shadow Hearts' biggest strength is undoubtedly its combat system. Like Grandia III released earlier this year, From the New World takes an established battle engine and tweaks it ever so to create a truly enjoyable motive for fighting against the bad guys. For the unfamiliar, Shadow Hearts uses the latest version of the Judgment Ring -- a circular turn-based interface that gives users control over how many hits they can land on an opponent. This system is all based on timing (tap the X button when a ticker lays over the right zone) and is used in various aspects of the game. Whether you're casting magic spells, trying for discounts at a shop, or trying to pull off some sort of cool special attack, you're going to use the ring.   The reason the Judgment Ring works so well in battle is for a multitude of reasons. For one, the enemies in From the New World are aggressive little bastards and will stop at nothing to kill you as soon as they can (they won't hold back, ever). Secondly, the system is entirely skill-based and unless you find the item that works as an ~always hit~ device later in the game, your own personal timing and Ring customization decisions (yes, you can alter it for every character you control) will dictate the outcome of every fight. It's also good to know that each combatant has a unique skill or ability that they bring to the table (be it taking snap shots of your enemies for card trading, creature metamorphosis, or whatever).   Shadow Hearts' battle system is still one of the best around. If the Judgment Ring isn't anything new to you, however, there are a couple of significant tweaks that have made it slightly better. Players can now read how high one of their launch attacks will go, for instance, allowing them to continue a combo with stronger accuracy. Plus, while we're on the subject of combos, they're much easier to pull off and can benefit from a new ~Stock~ system that resembles Xenosaga's. Combos, Double Attacks, and Double Combos can be executed this way. A new stellar chart magic system allows players to customize their spell-casting preferences too, and with multiple spell types and element classifications within each equipped grid, players are only limited by their imagination.    Because Shadow Hearts' combat system is such fun to use, it makes playing through the parts with less story a lot more forgivable. Also, the encounter rate in From the New World is at the highest level the series has thus far -- ensuring that you'll have plenty of battling to do before reaching the final cutscene. The only real qualm I have with the way this is setup, however, is the means by which you reach the battles themselves. In short, the dungeons feel somewhat tedious to explore because their designs are so straightforward and even repetitive. There are a few areas that are definitely worth checking out for sure, but it would have been great if they were a little more varied.   The sheer number of things that players can do in-between the main plot points definitely deserves a mention, though. In addition to the typical stuff you'd expect to see in any RPG (fetch quests, ultimate weapon hunting, etc), there are also a surprising number of mini-games that enables players to trade items for rare booty, participate in trivia contests, and throw down in pit fights. Multiple endings and a ~New Game +~ feature have also been included, and if you want to get everything, you'll absolutely have to use it.   This is the Judgment Ring. You'll like it. If you don't have any expectations, then Shadow Hearts: From the New World will probably surprise you with its trademark weirdness and entertaining battle system. There really are some great ~Wow~ moments that happen over the course of its story too, and the high-end CG cutscenes and musical score are easy to fall in love with. The problem is, the story itself suffers from horribly uneven pacing, the dungeons can be a little boring, and the ultimate payoff isn't really worth the effort (all important aspects of any RPG). These shortcomings have a lot more impact when you're a fan of the previous game as well, because in a lot of ways, From the New World feels more like an imitation than a sequel.Despite these criticisms, though, Johnny and Shania's adventure through Depression-era America is still worth checking out for its battle system alone.
