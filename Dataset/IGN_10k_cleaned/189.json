Sports fans, whom the programmers are undoubtedly creating the game for, want deep, realistic simulation. The casual sports gamer will want arcade-style action, which means it can't be too slow (an inherent problem in baseball). EA has solved this problem by combining the two elements, making Triple Play '97 one of the strongest baseball games around.  The graphics are amazing. EA has wisely chosen to use rendered sprites for the players, allowing for a greater amount of detail than if they had used polygons. The stadiums, however, are if full 3D, and are absolutely gorgeous. Everything is recreated in minute detail, from the signs on the fences to the buildings in the background. The announcer is an asset in Triple Play, not a hindrance as in some other game, and adds insightful commentary at just the right moments.  As far as control goes, it's good and solid, especially when it comes to batting. You can hit the ball pretty any where you want to, whether you want to pop a fly or hit a slicing line drive, it's all there. The pitcher's control configuration isn't as complex as the batter's, but is still quite nice. There are seven types of pitches to choose from, but each pitcher has his own specialty, so once you find your pitcher's sweet spot you should stick with it.  The arcade part of Triple Play '97 isn't as complex as, say, Bottom Of the Ninth, but as an overall game, Triple Play is the obvious winner. Well done.
