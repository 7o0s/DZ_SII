Focusing on the North Atlantic-based shenanigans of Germany's U-boats, it managed to balance a high level of realism with a surprisingly high level of accessibility. Better yet, it did all this within the context of brilliant graphics and a phenomenally engaging campaign. Now the designers have taken the same ideas and used them to treat submarine warfare in the Pacific. The resulting title, Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific, is every bit as good as the previous game. Though it's not without its problems, it's a sure bet for fans of undersea action.  The submarine commander has a number of tasks before him. Not only is he in charge of setting the overall route of patrol, but he also has to consider how and where to attack the enemy and how to get out of danger once before he's discovered. Maintaining the element of surprise and using your weapons to their greatest effectiveness constitute the most thrilling portions of the game. Lengthy journeys between targets is a considerably less dramatic but no less important part of the job.   First, you have to determine where to patrol in order to find enemy ships. In some cases, you might be sent radio messages from your headquarters that give you a rough idea of where enemy convoys have been sighted. In other cases, you may simply have a hunch that ships will traveling along a certain route based on where the enemy's bases are. In still other cases, you may just stumble upon an enemy by pure chance, either through radar contact or actually seeing a ship on the horizon.  After taking on a series of short tutorials that get you up and running with the main systems on your submarine, you'll be prepared to take on the enemy in the campaign or in a number of solo missions. But while the game outlines the basics of firing torpedoes or manning the AA guns, players who want to know more about the more sim-heavy options of plotting firing solutions will have to seek the information on their own.  In any case, the focus here isn't on protractors and stopwatches. The real point of the game is to put you in the shoes of a sub commander and force you to make the decisions about how you're going to engage the enemy rather than how to operate each individual station. Sure, those elements are present for players who want to enjoy them, but Wolves of the Pacific is more about the experience of being a sub commander than it is about the nuts and bolts of submarine operation.   Silent Hunter III offered a much more open-ended campaign than we saw in Silent Hunter II, and Wolves of the Pacific continues this trend. Rather than relying on scripted progress, events here unfold across the course of the entire war. There are some watershed moments that can't be missed but you're largely free to succeed and fail as you will. Some missions, like sneaking into Tokyo Bay to snap a few pictures, are relatively easy. Others, like trying to attack shipping in a heavily patrolled zone, are much more difficult.  It's a fact that submarines are the predatory bullies of the sea, taking on defenseless merchants and tankers (or god help them, even sampans), while running from fights with tougher opponents like destroyers and cruisers. Still, the wily submarine captain can sometimes seize an opportunity to take out a much stronger target, like a carrier or a battleship. The trouble is, these guys never travel without serious backup and you can quickly find yourself outnumbered. The AI here is just as aggressive as it was in Silent Hunter III, so if you bite off more than you can chew, you'll quickly be surrounded by depth charges and dive bombers.      As you progress through the campaign, you'll earn renown that you can trade in for upgrades to your existing detection equipment or for newer weapons. Whether you go with a stronger deck gun or a better air radar is going to depend on how you approach the game. Eventually you'll be able to move up from the lowly starter submarines to get more advanced models that have better performance and more torpedo tubes. Submarine history buffs will definitely appreciate the differences between a Porpoise and a Balao class, or between the lowly Mk 14 torpedoes and the fancier Mk 18s but, for gamers who don't already have an understanding of how and why these things are different, the in-game documentation offers absolutely no help.  As with the previous game, there's a wide range of realism options here that you can use to tailor the experience to your liking. Gamers who are looking for a more action-oriented approach can work without fuel limits, slow reload times, torpedo duds or any number of other common restrictions. Gamers who want the hardcore experience will want to turn off options for external camera views and plot their own firing solutions. What's great is that the game offers gamers the chance to set each of these options separately so you can set the realism and difficulty exactly the way you want it.   Wolves of the Pacific looks every bit as good as the previous Silent Hunter game. In fact, the graphics have been improved in a few key areas. To begin with, the water modeling is simply breathtaking. We've yet to see a more believable water model in any game and, given that so much of the action here takes place right at the waterline, that's a huge benefit.  Waves crash across the bow of your ship and the surface of the sea reflects moonlight and fire. Sea water pools on the lens of your periscopes and even smears the external camera for a bit as you come up from underneath the ocean. Torpedo hits send huge geysers shooting up into the air. The only aspect of the water model that's not completely believable is that the game seems to use a flat plane to determine splashes for shell impacts. You can frequently see splashes occurring above the trough of a wave. In all, it's a really tiny thing that only stands out because everything else is rendered so wonderfully.   Though there aren't the huge deformations from torpedo hits that we were hoping to see, the game seems to have a better damage model than we saw in Silent Hunter III. Different parts of ships still respond differently to weapon fire, but not so much that we can see much more specific visual representations of damage. It's gratifying to get close enough to see the holes you've punched into an enemy hull. Even better, you can sometimes even see sea water filling the space inside. When you get ships to actually explode in gouts of smoke and flame, it's a real treat.   As with Silent Hunter III, there are seemingly countless ways for ships to break apart and sink. Some list to the side before rolling under. Others go end up as they dive into the sea. Still others break completely in half and sink in two parts. Sadly, there's still no cinematic representation of your destruction here, so you're left to imagine for yourself what it might look like for your sub to implode.  Ships and ports are all wonderfully detailed. Ships have rust stains and rivets that you can only appreciate up close and there's a very realistic sheen to the metal surfaces. There's just as much detail present inside the ships. Your own crewmembers man the appropriate stations and go through the motions of the tasks before them. In port, you'll see all manner of cranes, warehouses, smokestacks, water towers and such. Unfortunately, most of the ports are rather lifeless and deserted. A little activity and a few crowds would definitely help the illusion here.      The sound effects definitely help to maintain the illusion. The creaking of your submarine's hull and the susurration of the sea provides a constant backdrop to the action. Weapons fire and impact sounds have a real sense of weight and convey the right amount of destructiveness. Voiced crew dialogue also adds to the sense of realism here but it has the added benefit of actually giving you information that you need about the world around you.  But it's not all good of course. Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific still suffers from some obvious shortcomings, some of which are an intentional part of the design, some of which are the usual bugs that accompany these types of games. In addition to the regular crash bugs, we've seen every member of the crew fall asleep all at once and been unable to end our patrols because our home port was taken by the enemy. (Even stranger, the ships outside of this enemy port were all friendly.)   While the time compression is much more robust this time around, long patrols still feel like a drag even at more than 7000 times normal speed. It would be much more effective (and fun) to take a cue from some of the flight sims that let you warp to the next moment of action. It's a real inconvenience to have the time compression switch off every time you get a radar contact, particularly when your crew is calling out the same contact every sixty seconds. The chunkiness of the interface means that any interaction with the patrol map requires you to drop the speed down to the 128x range. We might complain that you're not allowed to interact with any of the controls while the game is paused, but the pace of the game is so slow most of the time that it's not really a problem.Wolves of the Pacific is a brilliant submarine simulation that manages that rarest of balancing acts: providing instant accessibility to the newbies out there while still managing to provide enough detail and realism for the core grognard fan base. It does this by focusing on the decisions rather than the details of submarine operation. Those details are still there, of course, but the game is designed so that you approach it with the question ~What do I want to do?~ rather than the question ~How do I do what I want to do?~ The fact that it's freaking beautiful doesn't hurt either.Still, there are a few bugs that need to be ironed out. The team is already working on a patch that addresses some of the problems we've found in the missions, and that will undoubtedly make Wolves of the Pacific a much more satisfying experience.", "date": "Mar 21, 2007"}
