Better yet, games that are successful on the retail front are pretty much guaranteed to produce a sequel or two. Given that Alundra faired moderately well on the sales charts, with North American sales exceeding 150,000 units, it wasn't a surprise to see that a sequel was released in Japan and later picked up for release in the United States by Activision.   Alundra was not only a retail success but a critical one, as well. Most reviewers, who were blessed with any sort gameplay skills and didn't find the game too overwhelmingly difficult, considered first Alundra to be one of the best action/RPG's of recent times. With such big feet to follow, the developers had a dreadful task at hand of trying to follow-up one of the true videogame masterpieces.   Story  What probably made the task more difficult is that a different development studio was handling the sequel. Contrail handled the development duties of Alundra 2 instead of Matrix, the company responsible for the original. Because of this, it seems as if the developers decided to create an entirely new game from scratch instead of basing it on the original. While it's pretty common for RPG series to have completely unrelated storylines, they usually keep the worlds, items, or at least some things continuous. There's not really anything in Alundra 2 that really ties it to the original.   The biggest disappointment is that the game's namesake, Alundra, is nowhere to be found in the sequel. There's not even any mention of his name or any sort of reference to him or anything else from the original. The hero in Alundra 2 is named Flint and he's a very typical RPG character -- he's a young renegade and he must embark on a fantastical journey he's the world's only hope to defeat the evil terror. The story is fairly interesting, but it'll probably disappoint fans of the original's dark and gloomy theme because it's extremely light-hearted in nature.   While the overall story left a lot to be desired, Activision deserves a pat on the back for the game's rock-solid English translation. The game's writing is a big step above the average role-playing game on the PlayStation, as it is well-written, sometimes whimsical, and sounds natural when spoken out loud (most English text in RPG's tend to read like it's out of a textbook instead of being a person speaking). It really makes you wish that these guys had a better game to work with.   Gameplay Some gamers often dismissed the original Alundra because they found the game too difficult, while others were enthralled by the tremendously difficult boss battles and mind-numbingly complex puzzles. Gamers who found the first game to be much too difficult will most likely feel the same way about Alundra 2. Activision has provided the gamer with two difficulty options, Normal and Easy, but both provide quite a bit of challenge.   The main difference with the two settings is that monsters can take about twice as many hits before they're killed and they dish out about twice as much damage. Even if you consider yourself a skilled player, the normal setting might prove to be too difficult to handle. Basic wandering monsters generally take about six to eight hits to kill, and some of the boss battles can go on for over an hour. This is made worse by the fact that there are some collision and control issues that make it tricky to avoid some of the boss attacks or to strike the boss without getting damaged yourself.   The control issues combined with the boss difficulty (it generally only takes about four hits by the boss to kill poor Flint -- it varies based on the boss and the current equipment and HP level of the character) really makes Normal too much of a pain in the ass to enjoy the game. That said, the Easy level seemed to be pretty fair and well-balanced on the whole. The bosses are still challenging, but not painfully so, and the issues with the control don't stand out as much because you are given a bit more leeway.   Whether playing on the Normal or Easy difficulty setting, there are no apparent changes with the puzzles that you'll encounter in Alundra 2. There's not really anything new or revolutionary in the puzzle department, as the majority of the puzzles consist of the typical action/RPG puzzles that fans of Zelda, Landstalker, Dark Savior, or the original Alundra will have all seen in the past. However, the puzzles in the game have been well thought out and there aren't any that come to mind that didn't have any rhyme or reason, meaning that players should be able to logically figure them out without having to resort to a cheat guide.   The only real problem with the puzzles is that some there are a few that are made difficult by the fact that the player is required to constantly adjust the camera angles. This makes the game more difficult in an area where there shouldn't be any difficulty.   If you're able get past the fact that the game should be called something like The Adventures of Flint or Flint's Awakening instead of Alundra 2 and can get past the issues with the control, difficulty and cameras, you'll find that the game is packed with a lot of play value. Not only does the game offer more than 30 hours of gameplay, but it's also packed with a slew of very cool mini-games. The mini-games, while not enough to make the game great, do increases its overall value and fun factor. There are about 10 mini-games in Alundra 2 and they range from playing darts to games based on some arcade classics.   Graphics Going along with today's theme of change, the graphics in Alundra 2 are drastically different than its heralded predecessor. First and foremost, the original's 2D graphics have been exchanged with more state-of-the-art 3D polygonal attire. While this transformation is definitely a step up in the evolutionary ladder in terms of technology, it isn't necessarily a good thing.   One of the problems is that the move to the third dimension has brought forth some camera angle problems that negatively affect gameplay. Players will find themselves having to constantly rotate the camera angle just so they can keep the player in view. If this only happened every once in a while, it wouldn't be a bad thing, but it's a constant issue.   The polygonal characters are made up with very lively colors, which are generally pleasing to the eye, but they're plagued with jagged edges, clipping problems, and horrendous joints connecting each limb. The backgrounds are, for the most part, fairly well done and feature some excellent textures in some areas. Just as the case was for the characters, the developers decided to use a lot of lively, vibrant colors in the game's backgrounds.   The game is filled with quite a bit of cool lighting and translucencies that really come to the fore in the magical attacks. Many of the game's spells will fill the entire screen with its wonderous special effects. While the spells are one of the game's graphic good points, its overworld map is one of its biggest negatives. The maps, which consist of a flat hand-drawn map, are very uninspired and seem to give homage to the 8-bit gaming era. The use of a map of this kind was obviously a stylistic issue, but it just wasn't a good idea.   Sound The soundtrack of the original Alundra was orchestrated well and featured some classic tracks that made its separate soundtrack CD a must-have for fans of videogame music. The same can't be said about the music in Alundra 2. It's not horrible, or even bad, but the music just isn't that memorable and doesn't do much to stroke the emotional strings of the player.   However, the audio does have a saving grace, as the game's voice acting is among the best that you'll find in any PlayStation game. It's not quite up to the quality of Konami's Metal Gear Solid or Working Designs' Lunar: Silver Star Story, but it's a step above the typical voiceovers that you'll encounter in most games. The dialogue for the characters was well written and they were acted out with a lot of emotion and flair. Overall, it was an excellent job by the game's localizers. I consider the original Alundra to be one of the best games in the action/RPG category of all-time. It had an excellent, mature storyline, a superb translation, challenging puzzles, and rock-solid gameplay. Alundra 2 just doesn't stack up. It's not a bad game, but let's face it, it had some huge shoes to fill. I did enjoy the game's puzzles and was very impressed with the localization job by Activision (first-rate English translation and topnotch voice acting), but the game was really hurt by its less than precise controls, annoyingly difficult boss battles (on the Normal difficulty setting), uninspiring music, and graphical glitches. And even though the writing was exceptional, it didn't make up for the fact that the game had a really fruity storyline. A pretty big change for fans of the original game, which had one of the darkest storylines of any role-playing games in existence. Overall, as a stand-alone game, Alundra 2 isn't all that bad. In fact, it's a worthy purchase for any fan of the action/RPG genre. However, if you're a fan of the first game or are looking to experience Zelda on your PlayStation, you'll probably be disappointed. Just pretend that this has nothing to do with the original Alundra or Zelda, and you'll probably enjoy this game just fine. It's definitely one of the top five action/RPG's on the PlayStation (if you can name five action/RPG's on the system, please send an email to dave@ign.com).", "date": "Apr 13, 2000"}
