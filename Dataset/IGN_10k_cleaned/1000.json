{"name": "Croc", "name_review": "Croc", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/09/croc", "text": "In the world of Game Boy gaming, there are two categories of side-scrolling platformers. There's Mario, and the there are the not-Marios. In the Mario corner is every Mario game ever made (save perhaps the first Super Mario Land, but we can all forgive), and with it is every game made by sharp, creative designers who played and fell in love with the game so much that its brilliance inspired them. The other category is made up of games made by bean counters who, while passing by the cubical of bored programmers, looked over and exclaimed, ~Hey, you're playing Mario? Why don't you put that controller down and make me one of those real quick.~   Features:  30 environments to explore Croc can swim Ride on a magic carpet or cable car The promise of a potentially better sequel soon For Game Boy Color only  Guess which category Croc fits into? Here's a hint -- it's a bad game that feels really ooky and has cripplingly aloof control. Something is just off with the way Croc, a fine PlayStation and Saturn 3D game, handles. This is one of those odd games where the character leaps twice as fast as they move forwards (in the NES days, the opposite happened a lot, although neither is very comfortable). Hold down the button and he pops around insanely. The attack button is the same key as the turbo button, and the attack (a bicycle kick tail whip) travels with each use, meaning that if you use turbo to make a jump, invariably Croc will leap again after landing, spin and flip and come completely out of control, and you will die. In other words, this game could have used a few play testers.  There are just very few puzzles and challenges compared to a Mario or the recent Rayman. Croc's most difficult challenges are to go from left to right. Occasionally he has to find a key to open a gate, and levels are broken up with swimming, skiing, and riding levels, but nothing in the Game Boy Color Croc strikes me as innovative or even challenging. The toughest part is in wrestling the controls.  Graphically, Croc is average in every sense. The character sprite isn't as expressive as its 32-bit cousins, obviously, but no attempt was made to capture any of the charm of Croc in the game besides the color green. He slides and swims and... That's it. Whoopity-doo.  Yep, that really makes me yearn for another dull trip through the blah caverns and four-color environments in this game, battling red things and collecting brown things. Argonaut are sharp programmers and graphic designers when it comes to 3D (they were the chief force behind the original SNES Star Fox), but they are woefully rusty when it comes to sprites and 2D gaming. Hardly anything in the game is recognizable beyond flying thing, walking thing, and staying-still thing. If every environment hadn't repeated every other round, perhaps it might have been pleasantly plain, but as it is, the constant average quality is obnoxious. To be kind, the game is fast. That makes it better by far than valueless games like The Muppets or Rugrats. Also, the environments are large, and there is some exploring beyond the left-to-right gameplay. But Croc simply isn't as sharp and enjoyable as it should have been, and it's fatally deficient of everything that made the 3D versions at least enjoyable. It's a very average game, and really not worth the time. Maybe this failed attempt is why THQ is going for a whole new engine and top-down design for the sequel.", "date": "Jun 9, 2000"}
