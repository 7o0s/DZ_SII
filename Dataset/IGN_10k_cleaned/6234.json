The team has managed to hold its line of Ratchet and Clank titles to a very high standard that few other franchises could ever hope to achieve. And while I'm a fan of Naughty Dog's Jak series and Sucker Punch's Sly trilogy just like everybody else, for my money no other annual PS2 game has been as consistently fun as Insomniac's Lombax and robot duo over the last four years.   The latest outing in the series, Ratchet: Deadlocked, continues that over-achieving tradition by moving towards a somewhat alien direction. As any Ratchet fan can tell you, the first three games evolved beyond its familiar platform roots (and the Jak and Daxter technology) and into a full-fledged actioner in just a matter of years. This time, however, the designers haven't disguised the title's action chops at all -- this is a shooter and melee experience through and through, and almost every last hint of platforming has been left for dead along with Chairman Drek somewhere near the orbit of Veldin.   Ratchet will have to fight or be a slave forever. In Deadlocked, Ratchet's journey through the cosmos is all about survival and blowing things up. He, Al, and Clank have all been kidnapped by the evil network executive Gleeman Vox to star in the reality TV series, DreadZone. But unlike Annihilation Nation from Up Your Arsenal, DreadZone isn't a voluntary battle tournament -- the contestants here are fighting for their lives so that Vox can satisfy his curiosity as to who the greatest hero in the universe really is. Unfortunately for our Lombaxian pal Ratchet, he is one of those kidnapped heroes and for the rest of the story has to fight his way through multiple challenges and enemies towards his freedom.   Now as I mentioned earlier, Deadlocked is a different type of game than its predecessors. Sidekick robot and all-around cool guy Clank is out of the picture in this adventure and serves as a supporting character (don't expect to wear him on your back as you have in the past). Because of Clank's new status, Ratchet doesn't have anywhere near the list of impressive gadgets and items that he's enjoyed previously. In fact, other than his charge boots and swing shot, all Ratchet really has at his disposal are his decidedly powerful weapons, wrench, and guns.   Don't expect too many platforming sequences this time. This specific focus on blasting things has changed the level design of single-player levels quite a bit. Because the need for platforming is so small now, the verticality and number of areas where users will have to jump or make a maximum use of their hand-eye coordination is pretty low. In all, there are maybe four or five missions in the entire game that actually require the hop 'n bop that was so prevalent in the first two titles, and as a result, most stages are either based in enclosed arena-type areas or planets with wide open plateaus. The puzzle solving and open-ended world design has also been nixed in favor of a straight-forward mission-based proposition similar to another one of this month's high-profile actioners, The Warriors.    Despite the lack of multi-tiered levels compared to the earlier games, Ratchet: Deadlocked is still a heck of a lot of fun even when limited to mostly blasting things. Insomniac has truly perfected the feel of Ratchet's universe over the years and dropping into the middle of another war zone with some of the coolest weapons in videogames is just as satisfying now as it was last year.   In the single-player mode, that's exactly what users can expect to spend all their time doing too, which is to say, ~Blasting their way through a war zone.~ The number of enemies that you'll have to take on at any one time can get downright ridiculous and it's not uncommon to face challenges that pit you against 500 different creatures in five minutes. What makes this proposition so cool, though, is that mindless shooting isn't always going to win the day -- using the right combination of weapons against the right set of enemies in conjunction with the smart utilization of your two robot bodyguards makes a big difference (not so much on the lower difficulty settings, but definitely on the higher ones). Your two AI companions have a healthy set of neat little abilities to boot -- they can turn cranks that operate progression-hindering switches, throw EMP grenades to disable otherwise invulnerable shields, and act as satellite weapons against enemy swarms. The option to upgrade their armor and guns as well as change their paintjobs and heads is just icing on the cake.   Shooting and slashing is what you'll do most. To help diversify the almost 90 available missions, there are a few occasional alternate objectives other than just running around and blasting things. The familiar hoverbike and spaceship racing and shooting sequences, for example, are back here in full effect. And to make things even more interesting, Ratchet gains access to a handy Halo-type all-terrain vehicle similar to the one used in the last game as well as a super kick-ass spider tank that can cause some serious damage.   Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems in the single-player portion of Deadlocked that keep it from reaching the same level of acclaim that was so deserving in Up Your Arsenal. The first and most obvious of these issues is the aforementioned lack of open world exploration. Running around the individual planets and looking for hidden areas or killing extra baddies in different ways was a lot of the fun in the previous three games. In Deadlocked, however, every last mission is predetermined for you -- meaning that once you've completed what you need to complete in a given area, the conclusion screen appears and you head back to the hub world to choose another challenge. This kind of setup not only feels like a waste of time between the (thankfully quick) load times, but also takes away from the spontaneity of the earlier adventures. Shooting and eliminating stuff is fun, sure, but some of that's lost when it's so structured.   Spaceship battles are just one of many alternate mission types. Another snag that longtime Ratchet fans probably won't be too fond of is the fact that the number of available weapons in Deadlocked is roughly half of what it was in Up Your Arsenal -- the RHYNO3, Rift Inducer, and a lot of the other more unique weaponry have been axed in favor of the more traditional weapons like the Magma Cannon, Dual Vipers, and Fusion Rifle. At least we got a variation on the Plasma Whip that stood out so well last year, though (Scorpion Flail), and the ability to upgrade your weapons with both Alpha (ability) and Omega (secondary fire) modifications to mix things up a bit. Still, after years of cool weapon innovation, the lack of some truly creative blasters this year was definitely disappointing.    To be fair, though, the real focus of Deadlocked is its expanded multiplayer capabilities. Building on the same foundation that awarded Up Your Arsenal IGN's 2004 PS2 Multiplayer Game of the Year, Ratchet's latest offers just about online goody that PS2 owners could hope for. Not only does Deadlocked support broadband only (to avoid those lagging 56K users), it also has full USB headset and keyboard functionality. Better still, there are plenty of cool online modes that users can jump right into.   To be more specific, Deathmatch and Capture the Flag are back from last year and the new modes King of the Hill (keep yourself in the glowing area longest), Juggernaut (one player is shielded and super powerful while everyone else must take him down), and Conquest (a variation on the Siege mode from last year, where you must capture nodes for an overall point total) are just as much fun as the classics. Of course, players can create and form their own unique Buddy Lists and Clans if they're into the community aspect of the as well, and the available stat tracking is great. Players can even customize the rules of their skirmishes so that can control the various parameters of all 11 multiplayer maps (such as auto-spawn policies, ammo limitations, and the like) or play an offline co-op story mode with a second player (how's that for cool?)   The multiplayer options are great. Though diehard Ratchet and Clank fans will probably miss the puzzle and platform elements that made the earlier games a more complete experience (this one included), the shooting mayhem of Ratchet: Deadlocked is still a whole hell of a lot of fun. Insomniac's hilarious storytelling doesn't miss a beat even when presented in this year's more limited form either, and the awesome combat sequences are marred only by occasional (but very noticeable) battle slowdown and infrequent camera issues experienced during rail grinding.Ratchet's problems are easy to live with, however, when you realize just how much the multiplayer option has to offer. Five different game types, almost a dozen varying planets, plenty of customizable options, several cool power-ups, and an excellent stat tracking system are just a few of the reasons that you and nine other friends can should enjoy your next few months via Network Adaptor. Throw in a cool co-op mode and plenty of unlockable goodies, and you don't need any other reasons to pick this one up.", "date": "Oct 28, 2005"}
