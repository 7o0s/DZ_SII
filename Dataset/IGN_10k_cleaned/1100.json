There is a story to be told here and on that will new elements of gameplay.~   Now, I don't mean to ruin a good story before the last page has been turned, but here's the crux of what you learn while playing this game: Kano doesn't like Jax, Jax doesn't like Kano, and never the twain shall meet. The End.  Sadly, Midway has squandered several years of development (the game was originally meant for an N64 release back when that system was economically viable -- how long ago was that?!?), not to mention the patience of some of their best programmers (some of whom, including original MK creators, have left the company) and the once-good name of Mortal Kombat once again on nothing. There is no story here, nothing worth playing through, no great host of surprises. Why even bother pretending that Mortal Kombat has this rich heritage if you're not going to follow it? After all, it was Kano and Sonya  that had the rivalry in the beginning, and it wasn't until the third Mortal Kombat that Jax even had metal arms. But the producers of this game only had the interest of doing stuff that is 'cool', and to that end we have a jankey Blaxploitation style (all the rage after Tarantino... and then out again after G vs. E failed), a big dude with metal arms, and guys that explode in blood when you punch them.   Surprise -- it's a bargain-bin-by-release game, and it's not so hot.  Gameplay Midway promised us that, ~there is a story to be told here and on that will new elements of gameplay.~ New gameplay, in this case, translates to the same punch-kick button pummeling you've played in thousands of other games of this type, combined with awkward handling of weapons and explosives against cheap enemies. What a revelation!  What breaks this game isn't where it falls apart. It's where it almost succeeds. Midway attempted to do Metal Gear Kombat with this game, a free-roaming stealth-and-attack espionage adventure with the action jacked up to 11. And what's scary is that they almost had it.  Almost. With a killer gameplay fighting system, they had a good thing going here that was much more fun to play compared to wretched 3D brawlers like Fighting Force. True, the combos are unfortunately dial-in combos that have less to do with timing than just plain button-mashing restraint, but that's the way with MK, and the system works well in this beat-em-up. And, as a compliment against other fisticuffs failures, MK: SF enemies don't always have trouble attacking in 2-on-1 situations. Occasionally, the second guy will just sit around while you're dishing out a beating to his buddy, but the problem isn't nearly as limiting as in something like Nightmare Creatures 2.  But as soon as the game veers from Mortal Kombat territory, already a shaky bridge to be standing on, and starts trying to chase down the Metal Gear Solid path, the gameplay cracks. For one, you can't jump. You can climb on certain things if you're at an action point, but you can't jump around like in any other MK game (including MK: Mythologies), and being stuck on the floor gets dull in combat and while exploring. Then you find out why there isn't anything to jump on. The game's environment is barren, empty as a crypt. The open level architecture is better than usual building layouts, but emptiness makes you feel that the extra space and structural design expertise wasn't done for realism, but that they simply planned to fill the levels and just didn't have time to put anything in. Even pedestrian areas are empty. An entire room is filled with bookshelves, but when after you zip up and down the aisles, you'll find that no secret books are available to learn MK secrets. Most corridors lead to dead-ends, not to hidden power-ups. Don't explore.  Midway also ignored a few key points that would have made the gameplay more fun and challenging. The game uses the Dual Shock analog stick, but has no analog control -- there is no stealth in the game, and enemies always know you're coming. Sadly, that means that you can never sneak up behind somebody and twist their heads off in one smooth move, or breeze by them when you're low on health at the end of a stage. Also, the rewards system for combos is weak. You don't earn extra experience (experience is given in standard increments for beating an enemy). Instead, combos refill your special meter. Really, the only reason to do a combo is so you don't have to next time. How is that fun?  Up to that point, however, the game is still fun. I enjoyed Mortal Kombat: Special Forces a lot... until I met up with an armed enemy. Suddenly, the game becomes utterly unplayable. Because of Jax' flat-foot lack of stealth, baddies with guns always know you're there, even when you don't, and they open up a can of whup-ass on you with high-powered machine guns (which don't show tracer bullets to show you which direction they're coming from) while you're still trying to figure out where on the awkward-camera-shot screen they are. Even when you have a gun and try to snipe them, the game's smothering fog obscures their whereabouts, and if you're trying to kill them by hand, good luck running down a machine gun against these dead-eyes. It's just plain impossible to play when a machine-gunner is on-screen, and there can be several on the screen at a time. You can't even run away and regroup, because they can pinpoint you at twice the range you can even see them.  Graphics A yucky looking game, but that gritty, cheap-ass look is almost befitting Mortal Kombat at this point. Graphically, it's a mixed bag of nuts, with a lot of peanuts for those allergic to them. The lighting effects are great, with Bronzer gleaming off the bodies. There's also a lot of useless detail in the levels that just brings a smile. In the parking lot stage, the license plates have MK character names (which, incidentally, is the key to a puzzle). Sneak into the women's underground bathroom, and there will be somebody there showering.  On the other hand, the special effects are stand-in texture quality at best. The bright phosphorescent water effects look like a five year old's first try on a Doom WAD. Also, the FMV sequences are on the level of Syphon Filter, with cheesy Blaxploitation band slides and '70s freeze-and-zooms to snazz up sad production levels (why they didn't just use the game engine, we'll never know). When Jax stands in a burning parking lot and cries out apathetically, ~I'll get you, Kano!~, you know the design staff went as far as the Accounting department for their vocal talents and then gave up.  Then there's that nagging issue with the gunners and the cameras. I've mentioned how infuriating it can be to get lit up by an armed enemy when you don't know where he is, but the real problem isn't the camera angle. Actually, the camera does a good job keeping up, with pre-set angles making corridor battles easy to manage and always giving you a good vantage point for your surroundings. The camera is zoomed in too much for gun battles, making it tough to fight armed enemies, but if the game engine worked then you could at least learn bad guy paths and be prepared for them next time.  No, the real death of this game is that the graphic engine faults the gameplay. If you remember Nintendo's SNES game NHL Stanley Cup, maybe you recognize the same frustration I felt as the hockey puck -- on a straight shot for an empty net -- suddenly went off its path because the game's camera confused the game engine. CLINK! Off the pole. The same kind of graphic engine-against-gameplay phenomenon happens here, as enemies get lost in the thick fog. As you're zooming in with a sniper rifle, suddenly the polygon sorting works itself out and the bad guys can track you while you're looking for them. Except, of course, that the fog is still too thick for you to see what you're doing, so you have to zoom in more (at an aggravatingly slow zoom pace). All the while, they're lining you up in their sites. By the time you can even see their shady heads, much less draw a bead, they've launched a bazooka blast your way. Boom. If you're careful, you can impress your friends by zooming in to just the right point and then tapping in the last zoom adjustment for your death. ~Nothing on the screen, but huzzah! Tap, click, boom!~  Sound It's nice to know that the old MK voices are still here somewhere, but the rest of the soundtrack has been bullied into no shape at all. Kano's voice acting has some exuberance, in the way that Syphon Filter's Gabe Logan was pumped up, but getting a staff worker all aggro isn't enough. Hire some real voice talent, Midway -- somebody who's worked a cartoon or ad and knows how to inject character in a voice.   The real killer of this newest chapter in Mortal Kombat has to be the utter lack of storyline. What was supposed to be a revealing story behind the mythologies of Jax, Kano, and Sonya (who's not even in the game, except as a damsel-in-distress object to rescue -- some kick-ass Special Forces agent she turned out to be!) turns out to be nothing more than a standard Stallone or Schwartzenegger vehicle, sans the talent. No alarms, no surprises.There aren't even cut-scenes where you meet the big bosses and get geared up to kill them. Couple that with uninspired graphics and heartless audio, and you have a soulless game that, good gameplay or not (and it's not, just so you know), doesn't hook the player. After a climactic battle against a female boss, he tells his Special Forces Operative Contact that, ~She sure was a looker...~ But we never met her. We never knew why she wanted Jax dead. We never knew her motives. We never grew to hate her. And (short of reading the manual and watching the intro FMV) we never learned what she looked like. Now she's dead, her mysteries lost with her life. Jax takes great pride in finishing off this generic villain. I feel cold and indifferent, and start wondering if I'm fighting on the wrong side. How I wish I was Kano, fighting the good fight against the oppressive boredom of simple-minded good guys.", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
