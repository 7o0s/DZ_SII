The beautiful foliage. The wild animals frolicking in the wilderness. The 4x4 off-roaders squishing the frolicking animals, crushing all of the beautiful foliage, and polluting the air. There's just nothing like that sweet smell of destruction to get you revved up... wait a minute, I'm getting that familiar feeling... That's right, it's time for some more off-road mayhem. Courtesy of the fun loving characters over at Terminal Reality, The Gathering, and Take 2, the newest resident on the shelves of electronic stores everywhere is 4x4 EVO 2. The question is, is this second iteration all that it should be?  When the first game was released, I actually went into the experience a little skeptical, only having seen some of the footage and played some of the preview experiences. But much to my surprise, I was smiling and grunting and groaning... Well, let's just say I was having some fun with the game. It wasn't my girlfriend or anything, but very good for some quick play sessions and even some extended entertainment when I was feeling more frisky. EVO 2 doesn't disappoint in this respect. It still has the same gameplay style that allows you to jump in for some quick plays every now and again without feeling too guilty about wasting time.   Of course, that's also where I'm a little wishy-washy. Although I like the game a lot, it almost feels more like an extensive expansion than a completely new title. It isn't like they didn't add a bunch of stuff, but it didn't seem like a whole new experience. There are a lot of new cars, bringing the total up to some ridiculous number that I can't count to because I only have 11 fingers (basically all of the major manufacturers of off-road vehicles are here strutting their stuff), some nice new tracks, and more licensed parts to build your vehicle from. But when it comes down to it, its the same game.   The looks have been upgraded a bit from the last outing to take advantage of some of the higher-end graphic cards available, but they retain the same style and look except for a few new tracks that are a little brighter and more colorful. The cars and terrain look pretty amazing with plenty going on to catch your eye (even if stuff is recycled and a little cheesy) and some pretty good textures when you're darting by at 100 miles an hour. The particle effects for driving through sand and water are both very good and the game is obviously pushing much more, with many more free obstacles like rocks, lumber, oil barrels and the like than there were in the first game. One of the things I found slightly lacking in the looks department were some of the structures in the game. They don't play a huge part in the scheme of things so it isn't surprising, but a bare amount of polys was spared for the buildings, leaving a bit to be desired. But then again, you'll probably only notice the building textures if you run into one of them as you're usually flying by at some pretty high speeds.  Drivers are still visible in each of the vehicles, and you can see them steering. The water is clearer and nicer in some spots. Cars get dirty as they race, prompting you to clean them if you're in career mode. The sun streaks down over mountains... You know, all of the good stuff. But all of this was already in the first iteration. Oh, and one other thing, you might want to check the system specs before you go out and pick this one up cause it's not fooling around, you need a small supercomputer to run this sucker, but it's purty and smooth if you have what it takes.  Looks aside, the gameplay of 4x4 was, and still is, filled with ups and downs. This is not a simulation of an off-road racing experience. Don't go into the game thinking that, else you will be disappointed. What it is, however, is a fast and furious arcadey racing game with driving that bends a little towards the simulation side of things. Read: you can't go flying around a corner at 100 mph and expect not to flip over or go flying off the road.   In fact, you need to pick your paths well in some spots due to the physics engine installed. Flipping your vehicle is actually fairly hard to do when all is said and done, but the many bumps, hills, and dips can send your vehicle bouncing off into the realms of the unknown, down a cliff, into the water, smack into a rock...you name it, you'll probably end up in that position at some point. In fact, that again is one of the problems. There are spots that you'll get stuck real good. You wonder how it is that you can get jammed up in between a pyramid and a rock in Egypt, but it's possible, in fact I'm pretty good at it.   It does look like they've improved some of the collision detection when it comes to getting stuck on the corners of small rocks; however, some of the same problems with going head-to-head against other competitors are still there. Perhaps its due to the licenses and the restrictions on car damage and therefore accidents in general, but when vehicles hit each other, there's close to no consequences except for slowly being nudged out of the way, and a slight decrease in speed. Some may argue that this increases the speed and arcade nature of the game, but updating the physics engine to include some semi-realistic crashes would have been nice. Afterall, seeing the crashes is part of the reason why people watch racing and play racing games. I'm not asking for damage detail here (although I am asking for damage detail here but I understand the constraints and can't knock them for it) but some better reactions from the cars. This also goes for running into various objects such as rocks or gateposts. When you hit them going at incredible speeds, you pretty much just stop and stick. Your vehicle doesn't rock up or bounce off the objects with any kind of realism (except in one case where I went flying backwards about 200 feet).  The gameplay itself seems to move just a hair faster than in the first game, even on some of the old tracks, it moves a bit quicker. But some of the new tracks really lend to a sense that you're trucking along at some incredible speeds. There are some turns that will require some quick reactions on your part until you get to know the individual tracks. And you will need to learn the tracks if you plan on being successful at all in the game. Water is also a much bigger hazard this time around, now if you fall in, your car will work for a very short time at which point you have to wait till you stop to reset yourself on the track a little farther back in position.  Unfortunately, the AI doesn't seem to have gotten much better. It still drives like a lunatic and overtakes you at incredible speeds at times when it just seems impossible in order to take a win while at times it will get stuck on a rock for quite a while before remembering to back up and change directions.  The core elements are basically the same this time around with the obligatory quick race that lets you practice any of the tracks with the various types of vehicles from the beginner to the professional ones that really cook and are hard as hell to race with unless you're used to them. You can now roam free throughout the levels and check them out so that you can learn them a little better and check for shortcuts with any of the vehicles. Time trial makes it back as well, as is usually the case with racing games. And finally, the career is also in place again, which is really what I love about the game. You can build up an impressive array of vehicles (all of them if you really want in fact), modify them by buying new parts, and then race them in single races or series of races where you can collect more money to upgrade the rest of your vehicles. It's a fun little ride that will have you racing just to get that next part that will make your ride just that little bit better. It's really a fantasy for me and is therefore pretty fun because I never did get very far racing in the Geo Prism circuit. The only upgrade I could ever afford on my real car was a Club that didn't even work. But let us not speak of the dead like that... This time around there are also jobs you can take in career mode to gather more money. You'll be given an objective and a place to go on a map and be sent on your way. There are also secrets hidden around these levels where you can earn extra cash and the like to keep you busy.  When you get right down to it, 4x4 EVO 2 is another pretty solid racing game. And while it isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's really, really like the first game with some additions and not much change to the look or the feel. I'm not going to discount it, however, as games like NHL and Madden come out with new iterations that are virtually the same as well, but with new players. So if you think of it in that respect, it's a hoot. Those that really enjoyed the first game will undoubtedly find this one to their liking, but enough to spend over 40 bucks on? So the answer to the question at the beginning of the article will have to be that your own wallet will have to decide that. It's definitely a good game, but maybe not worth the bucks if you're strapped for cash and already have the first one.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?

I wouldn't call myself a dedicated fan to the sport, but I do appreciate good simulations and arcadey takes on racing. From Gran Turismo to Burnout, I often find I can't pull myself away from the TV. Even as a kid, I remember I fell in love with a game called Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road, which I'm reminded of when playing 4x4 Evo 2. It used to have a similar setup where you earn all this cash to buy yourself better parts for your big, bad 4x4.So, naturally, I was pretty excited by the sheer volume of cars and parts you could buy in 4x4 Evo 2. Setting up my vehicle was pretty entertaining, but as soon as I began racing in my career I just found the races to be generally boring. The only reason I wanted to press on was to earn more cash to upgrade my vehicle. Since the core of the game is racing, after all, and not purchasing cars and parts, I can't say I recommend investing in 4x4 Evo 2. Only the most mouth-frothingly fantatical 4x4 devotee would be rewarded by what it has to offer.", "date": "Nov 6, 2001"}
