Among its many well-known titles are Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill and depending on how far you go back, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Among the slew of games it pumped out in the late 1990s and after, Konami's bread and butter game franchise was undoubtedly the Bemani series.   In other words, dance games: Dance Dance Revolution to be precise. Touching upon the rather oppressive, get-in-line Japanese culture, Konami's dance games freed the generally quiet, polite and introverted populace into dancing fiends. Similar but not the same as the phenomenon behind karaoke singing, the dance arcade machines began springing up all over Japanese arcades. The fad quickly enlarged to a long-lasting trend and then into what seemed like a standard part of the culture. It seemed like every six months a new DDR would appear, updated with new songs, graphics and what-have-you.   In between the late 1990s and now, Konami's Bemani games trickled over to other countries, and now, in 2003, the entrenched Dance Dance Revolution series has a new face, not surprisingly named DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution. Like the good Dr. Reverend Dr. Smith said in his last DDR MAX review, what is left to say about this game? I'll tell you.  Gameplay Like I said in the strapline, same as it ever was -- which is not a bad thing, by any means. Now many of you might be saying, ~Wait...when was the last time Doug reviewed a dance game?!!~ Funny you say that, cause while I have reviewed many console-based dance games, I have never reviewed a Dance Dance Revolution game before, be it console of arcade.   So, when I realized Kaiser was going to join the Xbox site, there was nobody but me to review it. I brought home the dance pad and played hours and hours (my family can attest to this) of both DDR and DDR2. I even went to the arcades to test my lagging dance skills. To be honest, I'm still not that good, but I've beat the game dozens of times, having completed all of the training steps, and multiple modes, and sadly, embarrassingly, sheepishly, I'm hooked.   It took years really to get to this point, I admit. I've been sort of pushing it off, this whole DDR thing. And now, while I'm still not a big fan of the 9/10th of the music, I've passed the point of no return. DDRMAX2 is totally addicting, entirely difficult to put down, and the limit of one's playtime seems pretty much endless. It's ridiculously good fun.   So yes, the game, I should be getting to the game now. As the press release says, DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution is filled with new features and additions, or at least, changes and updates to last year's game. The new song additions include Busy Child (The Crystal Method), Little Bit Of Ecstasy (Jocelyn Enriquez), and Get Down Tonight (K.C. & The Sunshine Band). Seriously, this song list is huge, impressive and for those who are picky, it seems there is enough for everyone in here. On the other hand, for the purists, it's probably got too many popular songs in it, thus diluting the mix, but you can't please all the people all the time.    Personally, I dislike most of the songs. This is the not the music I would choose to dance to, being closer to less commercial stuff, and being more interested in bands such as the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Stevie Wonder, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips and The White Stripes instead. But, being open-minded, I enjoyed the breadth and variety of songs, discovering that many of the hyper-fast J-Pop songs were way fun. Also, even the cheesy pop stuff - which you'll never find in my CD collection -- turns out to be good to dance to.   The new modes are interesting, since they work in as part of the culture evolving around the game's late night popularity. For instance, NonStop Mode enables gamers the chance to set up themed song lists played without breaks, giving players a little DJ-role-playing tease. Then there's Endless mode, which plays through all the songs continuously throughout the night, giving dancing fiends, well, as he mode says, an endless amount of music. These modes bode well for those all night Fanime sessions and super geeked-out gamehead parties.  The Workout mode, like last year's mode, does its job, albeit rigidly. Select a calorie goal, and then dance to your selected group of songs until you reach the limit. It's easy and, as I learned, you will work off calories. It's really the best exercise, the kind that you never really realize you're doing. The Training Mode is also well thought out, offering players numerous try outs, goals and providing a framework for those people who never really got the whole thing. It shows you where to place your feet, how to double up, and how to approach a multitude of fast steps.   Adding to the replay value is the ability to create your own dance steps in Edit mode and to change the difficulty modifiers. The interface for these is a little clunky, but they do work well once you know what's going on. Also, at least for newbies, the different levels of difficulty make this far more accessible. The pressure of knowing previous songs or dance moves is off, and now players can get up from the ground level at their own speed.   To experience the game at its fullest, however, you should really play this game in the arcades. If that doesn't work, then at least buy the game with the dancepad. Otherwise, it's worthless. It's reasonably prices at $59.99 (with the dancepad) or if you have to buy it separately, it's only at $29.99.   Graphics The graphics are what they are -- they serve the purpose of generating some peripheral visuals that are interesting for the watchers and the crowd, rather than for you, the dancing fool on the pad. True, it's slightly engaging to see a polygonal female figure up there dancing, but it's not going to get me to play it. As with many games based solely on gameplay, the visuals are simply not that important. It's all about the dancing gameplay.   The changes seem a little weird, but at least they're something. New licensed music videos play during songs, and honesty, it neither ruined nor enhanced my experience. For a guy who gets paid to critique stuff, strangely I have nothing much to say about them.  Sound The song list is massive (more than 65 songs), thus even I found something I like. It includes:  Little Bit Of Ecstasy (Jocelyn Enriquez) AM-3P (KTz) BREAK DOWN! (Be For U) Busy Child (The Crystal Method)  CELEBRATE NITE (N.M.R) CONGA FEELING (VIVIAN) D2R (NAOKI) Days Go By (Dirty Vegas) DESTINY (NAOKI featuring Paula Terry) Do It Right (SOTA featuring Ebony Fay) DREAM A DREAM (CAPTAIN JACK) DRIFTING AWAY (LANGE featuring SKYE) Get Down Tonight (K.C. & The Sunshine Band) GHOSTS ~ VINCENT DE MOOR REMIX (TENTH PLANET) Groove (Sho-T featuring Brenda) Heaven (DJ Sammy & Yanou featuring DO) HYSTERIA (NAOKI 190) I feel... (AKIRA YAMAOKA) I Was The One (good-cool) IN THE NAVY '99 ~ XXL Disaster Remix (CAPTAIN JACK) Jam & Marmalade (Final Offset) Keep On Liftin' (dj nagureo) Kind Lady (OKUYATOS) LET'S GROOVE (TIPS & TRICKS VS WISDOME)  LONG TRAIN RUNNIN' (BUS STOP) Love At First Sight (Kylie Minogue) LOVIN' YOU ~ ROB SEARLE CLUB MIX (VINYL BABY) Rain of Sorrow (NM featuring Ebony Fay) Secret Rendezvous (DIVAS) Silent Hill (THOMAS HOWARD) SO DEEP ~ PERFECT SPHERE REMIX (SILVERTEAR) Spin the disc (good-cool) STILL IN MY HEART (NAOKI) SUPER STAR (D.J.RICH featuring TailBros.) Take Me Away ~into the night~ radio vocal (4 STRINGS) THE SHINING POLARIS (L.E.D. featuring Sana) THE WHISTLE SONG ~ Blow My Whistle Baby (DJ ALIGATOR PROJECT) TSUGARU (RevenG vs DE-SIRE) TWILIGHT ZONE ~ R-C Extended Club MIX (2 UNLIMITED)  Will I? (Ian Van Dahl)  The songs are super important to most players, especially since this series now has so many old favorites, and Konami does a great job of unlocking huge amounts of previous favorites and new songs to give players a feeling of variety and depth.Strangely, the whole appeal of dancing in public on an arcade machine to songs I haven't ever heard before never appealed to me. I just never bought into it. It just seemed like a chance to embarrass myself over and over. I suppose I'm very American that way. But I've always liked games along the same lines in consoles, such as  Parappa the Rapper, Um Jammer Lammy, Bust-A-Groove (or Move) and Frequency and Amplitude. Which is why the console version, with dancepad in tow, is nearly perfect. I can practice at home without looking like a fool and, once I get better (which will take awhile, sadly), I can show my moves. You'll be wondering at this point why the review score is lower than the previous game. The straight fact is, the previous reviewer (David Smith) was a huge fan of the series, and he simply overscored it. No fault, it happens, but after having spent numerous hours playing it, DDRMAX2 is undoubtedly a good game. But in my opinion, it's not a 9.3.", "date": "Oct 7, 2003"}
