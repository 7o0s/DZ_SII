Such is the case with Gas Powered Games' Dungeon Siege II: Broken World. After putting the beatdown on Valdis last year and basically throwing everything into chaos, you're now being called back to face a new threat and deal with some of the fallout from your previous battle.  Unfortunately, the story is a little thin, more suitable for a side quest than a complete expansion. Sure there's a bit of new content here but it doesn't carry the same weight as the events from the core game. The story is typical fantasy fare: a dark wizard has arisen and the inhabitants of the world, particularly the dryads and dwarves, are beset with problems. Nines times out of ten these problems are solved with the pointy end of the sword. The prospect of forcing the character to face the consequences of his world-warping victory might have been taken a little father but what we end up with here is a standard hack-and-slash style where problems are solved by stabbing or scorching them to death.   There's a new race here in Broken World, the Dwarves. Not only are they available as a playable race, but there's a whole dwarven community in the game that needs your help. You're free to create a new dwarven hero to use in the original Dungeon Siege II as well. As with the other races, the racial benefits of being a dwarf don't really set them apart at higher levels but they do give lower level dwarves a unique sort of identity.  While you can probably live without experiencing the thrills of life as a dwarf, you'll definitely want to check out the two new classes -- the Blood Assassin and the Fist of Stone. The Blood Assassin combines ranged abilities and combat magic, making them an excellent choice for a party that really needs to dish out the long-range damage. Having the ability to switch between bows and spells makes things a little easier on your mana potion supply. Their special ability to set the blood of their enemies on fire is particularly attractive.  The Fist of Stone is even more versatile than the Blood Assassin. These guys split their attention between melee combat and nature magic, which makes them the ideal heroes both for wading into battle and for supporting their teammates. While more specialized characters might be better at their individual tasks it's hard to pass up the chance to try out the new powers and abilities of these two new hybrids.   The challenge level is quite high here so it's worth importing your old Dungeon Siege II characters just to have a leg up. There are a handful of pre-made characters you can choose from if you don't have your old DS2 saves but they're at the bottom of the food chain in the Broken World. When you're facing up against a 60,000 hit point monster that craps death, you'll be glad to have more than just an entry-level hero.  Happily, the powerful enemies force players to think a little more carefully about how they approach each encounter. I went into the game with the same button-mashing strategy common to most action-RPGs and I quickly found myself in over my, admittedly short, dwarven head. More attention has to be paid this time around to properly outfitting each character to support their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Party formation is also more important this time around but since most spells and bows have a ten-foot range, even your rear rankers will almost always find themselves in the thick of the action.  Unfortunately, all the strategy and tactics are based on preparations you make before each battle.  There are cool abilities and moves that you'll need to activate during the actual fighting but, once the action starts, the game devolves back into hyperactive button mashing.  It's equally disappointing that the reagent system is nearly as unnecessary in the expansion as it was in the original game. Enchantable items are rarely better than the stuff that the monsters drop themselves, so there's little incentive to experiment with this aspect of the game.       The frenzy of battle rises to new heights here courtesy of all the spell and combat effects. While the overabundance of bright effects is a problem I had with the original game, it's even more of an issue in this high-level expansion. If you have more than one caster in your party, it's quite easy to lose track of the action amid an eruption of firebolts, ice blasts, force waves and such. Heck, even the plain melee attacks generate a light show that rivals TRON. Just trying to keep tabs on your plucky dwarf in this spectacle is hard enough.  You'll definitely want to take some time out to appreciate the enemies, from the fire-headed stick dudes to the to fireball spitting frogs to the dryads who whip blades on chains at you. There's even a memorable fight with monsters that are literally just little piles of leaves. As inventive as the rank and file enemies are the bosses aren't as dramatic as they could be given that you face each of them multiple times. Believe me, every time you kill a boss, you're going to have face another one just like him somewhere down the road. In a few cases, you're even going to fight him in a location that looks the same too.   The game engine is definitely starting to show its age but I can't really complain about the visuals. Sure, the models are a bit blocky in the close-ups and, sure, the textures are sometimes a little flat, but I think the art style goes a long way towards making up for whatever technical shortcomings the engine has. Few games are as effectively moody as those in the Dungeon Siege series and Broken World continues that tradition. The dungeons, the deserts and the forests all have such atmosphere that it's easy to lose yourself in the world. My only complaint there is that the towns are remarkably thin and the dungeons much too repetitive to be believable.  It's harder to forgive the persistent framerate problems and the narrow range of the camera. Broken World is a very active game and there's almost always a lot going on at one time. Even on a fairly powerful machine, we encountered frame stutters that are hard to accept given the quality of the graphics. This issue, and the inability of the camera to provide a participant's perspective of the action, won't be news for fans of the game but it still cries out for improvement.   It's no surprise that the expansion features excellent audio. The voice work has always been a priority for this series and Broken World doesn't disappoint. There's more recorded dialogue in this expansion than there in many full games and it's all of good quality. Loads of meaty-sounding effects accompany each battle, while the subtle but insistent environmental effects lend a sense of life to the between fights. To be honest, I really had to pay attention to convince myself that the game had music. It's not that it's of poor quality, but it sits so far back that the other sounds simply overwhelm it.   If you really crave more of that Dungeon Siege II action, you'll definitely find it in Broken World. The problem is, you won't find enough of it to last you more than two or three days.  And while there are some interesting additions here, the main arc of the story just isn't dramatic enough to support it all. I like that the combat is hard enough to force you to outfit your party properly but the action still winds up being little more than a clickathon.", "date": "Aug 11, 2006"}
