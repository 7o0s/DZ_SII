You've been the butt of our videogame jokes for two years now. I don't know, it must be something about those perky smiles or the fact that we've watched you two grow up next to our friend Bob Saget for over a decade  and the last thing we expect is a series of videogames from you two. But what's this? Can it be? A quality game branded with the Mary-Kate & Ashley trademark. Surely we've taken too many Mary-Kate & Ashley vitamins over the months, right? But it's true -- Mary-Kate & Ashley Winners Circle isn't just a unique Game Boy Color title, it's also a heckuva lot of fun to play, too. You just have to get over the fact that you're playing a game featuring -- gasp -- Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen. Features Choose your horse and outfit Tournament and Challenge mode Password save Only for Game Boy Color  ~Real Games for Real Girls.~ That's what it says on the box, so if you're of the Y chromosome you can pretty much stop reading this review  while, yes,  the game is fun for everyone, you'll be completely ridiculed for even having this cartridge hovering near your masculinity.  Now that all that's out of the way...  You've all seen those horse-jumping shows on Saturday afternoons when networks have nothing else to air, especially when there's no basketball or football games scheduled. That's exactly what this game's all about. Mary-Kate & Ashley love the horses, and with your help, they can enter the horse-jumping shows, too!  First, choose either Mary-Kate or Ashley  honestly, it doesn't matter which one you pick, as it's the horse that's going to do all the work. That's where the real choice comes into play  do you want a high-jumping, slow, unresponsive horse? Or a speedy, controllable thoroughbred that can't leap fences to save its life? Because when it's your turn out on the track, you're going to know if you've made the right decision  it's all about getting through the three competitions of three events with the shortest time possible.  The game's challenging for the first few rounds, since you have to get a feel for the controls  I recommend choosing the ~Ashley~ controls, as it feels more like an overhead racer (or even Tony Hawk) because you're rotating the horse clockwise and counterclockwise...the ~Mary-Kate~ controls are awkward and require a little more patience with its ~point-the-horse-in-the-direction-you-want-to-go~ style scheme. It's all a matter of following the well-defined path, and leaping when you approach the hurdle  time it too early, and you'll knock down the obstacle...time it too late and your horse will refuse to jump, coming to a halt and adding precious time to the clock. You don't get penalized for knocking down the hurdles, but your horse gets better with every successful jump  you'll earn power-ups that will increase the horse's speed, agility, jumping, and temperament.  If you're not successfully getting a blue ribbon in the tournament, it may be the horse  that's where the Challenges come into play. By successfully completing tasks (grabbing apples, donuts, baseballs in a set amount of time), you'll gain access to newer, better horses that will come in handy in the later events. These challenges also add a little variety to the overall gameplay experience.  Here's the kicker  the game is a really good challenge, with only one real gripe: it can be completed in a little more than an hour. The game was developed by M4, the team responsible for the equally cool Jeremy McGrath on the Game Boy Color  and judging by the controls and graphics, I'll bet that Winners Circle is using the same game engine. This is definitely the best of all the Mary-Kate & Ashley Game Boy Color titles, but it won't last very long at all. I will say this  the ending is one of the most clever credits sequences I've ever seen.  Yeah, I like this game. Wanna make something of it? It's definitely the best of the Club Acclaim series -- with the exception of Bust-a-Move Millenium, of course. It's a short ride for us big boys, but perhaps the folks in the demographic Acclaim's trying to hit will find a bit more lastability in Winners Circle.", "date": "Apr 9, 2001"}
