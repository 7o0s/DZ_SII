More than pumpkins might scream in the dead of night with mDisney's announcement of a mobile Nightmare Before Christmas game, based on the neo-classic stop-motion film from Tim Burton. Jack Skellington, hero to mall goth kids across the country and in Japan, has already starred in a pair of vids on the PlayStation 2/Xbox and the Game Boy Advance. Those were more straight-forward action games -- the mobile Skellington sim is a puzzler, not entirely unlike those creaky push-the-boxes games like Boxxle. Oh well, at least you're not going to hear ~Soul Robber!~ every five seconds.   You must help Jack collect presents scattered around Halloween Town before heading off to scare the living daylights out of the boys and girls on Santa's list. On each screen, you must push pumpkins to clear paths, making sure not to block off a present or eliminate an escape route. Once you have collected all of the presents in the minor maze, the present bag lights up and acts as your exit. The mazes are filed with more than toys, though. Creepies like skeletons and witches haunt the mazes and you must make use of environmental obstacles to outwit them. For example, skeletons cannot walk across snow banks, so as long as Jack says in the fluffy white stuff, he can avoid trouble.   The game design is certainly sound -- but it lacks the inspiration that made the movie great and all of its characters such beloved icons. The Nightmare Before Christmas movie was a monster of inventiveness, such it's a huge disappointment to see the license slapped on a hoary concept like this. As mentioned, the mechanics work fine, but once you're over the thrill of hanging out with Jack again, the game grows old.   Developer Happy Fun Team did a solid job on the graphics -- Jack looks good, even if he is a bit squatter than his normal spindly self. The sets are dressed up appropriately with Halloween Town and Christmas decorations. The game also plays music from the movie in the background -- which is a cool bonus.  Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfunctory puzzler that gets nothing wrong per se, but it slumbers through the paces. The license deserves more than a push-the-box puzzle game. There graphics and music are good, and I did appreciate the level select that lets you replay puzzles for better scores, but this is such an over-used design that I got bored far sooner than I wanted to be. I'm a huge Nightmare fan, so the disappointment was stinging. I suspect other Nightmare fans will feel the same way.", "date": "Oct 6, 2006"}
