It wasn't a huge success by any means, but those that played it and were able to get into it were generally extremely pleased with the product.   In all likelihood, the PlayStation 2 sequel to Jade Cocoon will likely experience the same kind of mediocre success, as it will undoubtedly be overshadowed on the retail end by the likes of Final Fantasy X from Square. However, just like the original, Jade Cocoon 2 will be enjoyed by those who give is a chance, as it's as enjoyable as monster breeding games can get.  Story The game's story begins some centuries after the first game ended as the player takes control of a very young and bright-eyed boy named Kahu who has dreams of becoming a ~cocoon master~. Early on in his adventure while trying to obtain his Beast Hunter License, Kahu finds himself possessed by a parasitic entity that he learns will eventually kill him unless he finds the four forest orbs.   So, with the goal of finding the four orbs, he must venture with his newfound fairy friend, Nico, and search the four forest lairs, which are based on wind, earth, fire, and water, for the orbs to save his life. It's not all that original and serves more as a backdrop for the game's focal point, the monster breeding, but it's actually told quite well through the numerous in-game and pre-rendered cut scenes that all feature full voiceovers for all the characters.   However, as good as the story presentation can be at times, it never helps raise the story to anything more than what it is -- a simple story that gives you a reason to play the game and not one that moves you to keep playing through the game. If you're looking for an epic story, you're not going to find it here.  Gameplay That said, Jade Cocoon 2 isn't a game that's meant to be played for its story. This game is all about collecting monsters, breeding them and leveling them up. Seems pretty simple, right? Well, it is a very simple concept on the surface, but what you get here in Jade Cocoon 2 is an amazing amount of depth in both the breeding aspect of the game as well as it's battle system.  There are more than 200 different species of monsters that can be breed to create more than a billion combinations (or so the back of the box says -- I haven't counted). Each of the different species has a particular elemental base of fire, wind, water, or earth and each elemental base offers a distinct characteristic. For instance, Water Elementals primarily heal, Earth protects, Fire attacks, and Wind causes status attacks.  What's more, the different Divine Beasts that you have can be breed to create new creatures that have characteristics of other elementals that it's not normally accustomed to. The battle system is based around all of these species, elemental types and breeding possibilities, as Kahu is put in the center of a circular grid that has him surrounded by up to eight different monsters (with the total he can control based on his level).   The grid has the four elemental sides and each can hold up to three Divine Beasts, with the one in the center needing to have a skill at the particular side's elemental type and with the one's adjacent to the one in the middle allowed to have elemental attributes of the adjacent sides.  When attacking, you can switch back and forth between the different elemental sides with the L1 and R1 buttons and when you choose to attack, the subsequent attack will be made depending on the skills of your three monsters in the front row.   When you factor in the huge variety of monster types and skills that you can have with the numerous placement options with the eight spots and four elemental types, what you get is one of the most insanely deep combat systems around. The strategic limits are pretty endless and while you might not need to make use of the full potential in the game's single player quest, the two-player battle mode provides for an engaging challenge.   All that said, some players might not get over the fact that this game offers nothing more than breeding and building up. The levels are completely repetitive and the story is unmoving. If you're going to get into this game, it's going to be for the deep battle system and monster breeding aspects -- nothing more.  Graphics An argument can be made that Jade Cocoon 2 is one of the best looking games of 2001. It's not a technical achievement, meaning that it's not pushing billions of polygons, using mind-blowing special effects, or pushing the PS2's processor to its limits, but it's definitely an artistic one.  The character and monster designs, which have been created by the same artist responsible for Princess Mononoke, are simply off the hook. Plus, everything on the screen has a very clean look and all of the characters, monsters, and background elements are so vibrantly colored and satisfying to look at. Simply put, this is a very pretty game.  My only complaint about the visuals is that while everything looks breathtaking, there's just not a lot of variety in the backgrounds. Once you've seen the first few levels you've pretty much seen them all. There is some minor variances that you'll see as you progress further into the game, but it's more of a change in color, size or effects and not anything substantially different.     Sound The soundtrack for Jade Cocoon 2 is very good and is pleasant to listen to but it's just a bit too subdued for my tastes. What I mean by this is that while the music itself is good, it lacks the power to truly deliver any sort of an emotional impact. The battle music, for instance, doesn't create a sense of urgency or danger, and it really ought to.   Meanwhile, the voice acting in the game is mixture of both excellent and substandard qualities. The voices are actually quite good and generally fit the characters that they're representing like a glove. In fact, the voices for Kahu and especially Nico are two of the cutest sounding voices that I've ever heard in a videogame or any other form of interactive entertainment.   The problem with the voice acting is that what's said doesn't always flow together that well. Characters will often respond to questions or statements awkwardly and because of this you fail to get the feeling that you're listening to a real-life conversation. It's not a huge problem, though, and more of a nitpick than anything, as the quality of the voiceovers on the whole are better than you'll encounter in most videogames. Jade Cocoon 2 isn't your standard role-playing game. So if you've never played the original on PlayStation and are looking for an RPG for PlayStation 2 in the same vein of something like Square's Final Fantasy X or Midway's Shadow Hearts, you might want to steer clear of this title from the Japanese-based Genki. This game is primarily about monster breeding and character building with a story thrown in just to give you an excuse to work your way through the game while you continuously find new monsters, create new ones through breeding and power them up. It pretty much takes everything that was done with the original and expands it in every way. The battle system is now much deeper, there are a ton of new monsters that can be found and created, the game is much larger on the whole and the gameplay is as addictive as ever. Fans of the original Jade Cocoon, as well as those enamored by games like Monster Rancher and Pokemon, will surely love this fascinating sequel.", "date": "Dec 29, 2001"}
