It did an admirable job of conveying a hip urban aesthetic, but the game itself suffered from a few nagging flaws. Looks will only get a game so far in this industry, and so FIFA Street never made a lasting impression on the gaming press. Remedy some of its problems, though, and FIFA Street could easily transform into an alternative sports title worthy of recognition.   FIFA Street 2 for PSP improves a little of what plagued the original, though for the most part it plays the same. On the other hand, the console version took the high road and fixed these problems. The resulting product offers a much better soccer experience than its predecessor, making the PSP effort somewhat of a curiosity. On the one hand, it improves character animation and the overall look of the game, but on the other, it almost completely ignores the improvements of the console version. Soccer fans then have to contend with a marginally improved version of what they played last year. It's portable now, so that has its own appeal.    But those hoping to score a handheld version of FIFA Street 2 on consoles will need to wait. The game leaves out taunts and cuts the number of tricks players can perform, for starters. The problem stems from the lack of a second analog stick, and therefore a dedicated ~trick stick~ like in the console game. This means that players need to use a trick button, though it doesn't do as good a job. Players have limited control form the start. Beyond this, it's just cooler, and frankly more satisfying, using the trick stick. Having said that, using a button functions just fine. It won't get in the way of the game; it's just not as gratifying.   The collection of modes available is actually decent, if a little predictable. The lone standout, Rule the Street, takes players through a career. It starts with a reasonably comprehensive character builder. Players can choose among different body types, faces, skin color, height and definition. The process doesn't take too long, though the PSP stuttered when cycling through the different options. From here, the game introduces the upgrade screen where players distribute 2000 ~skill bills~ to create their very own soccer star. This section offers plenty of areas to customize, such as speed, shot accuracy and tackling. After choosing a logo and some teammates, it's off to the streets.  The goal is to win ten tournaments. Playing against local teams and eventually traveling the world adds some depth to the game, though the whole endeavor gets to feel repetitive. Even with the option to add new players by competing in special games, not to mention mini-games to earn more skill bills, Rule the Streets lacks appeal. Again, it's not broken, though aforementioned issues apply, but previous soccer offerings have simply provided so much more. In addition to Rule the Streets, FIFA Street 2 also offers quickie modes that require little commitment (or time) to play. Problem is they're almost too shallow. Sharpshooter, for instance, has players shoot goals from specific parts of the court - fun one second, dull the next. As for Striker -- it's just mindless goal shooting with a time limit.    FIFA Street 2 has problems left from its predecessor. It improves some areas, specifically in the areas of animation and overall presentation, but the actual gameplay gets no special treatment. The mini-games offer little in terms of replay value and the head-to-head multiplayer mode is pretty basic. If this had been a portable version of the console FIFA Street 2, then it'd be a whole different (and much better) beast.", "date": "Mar 29, 2006"}
