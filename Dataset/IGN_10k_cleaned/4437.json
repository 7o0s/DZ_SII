{"name": "Nightshade", "name_review": "Nightshade", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/06/nightshade-2", "text": "After the interesting fall of 2002, in which we saw three mainstay old-school games reappear in mostly re-imagined forms, there seemed to be a wide split between whether the mining of these old classics was such a good idea in the first place. Naturally, those people who spent too much time grinding their teeth on ruthless 8- and 16-bit games have greater sentimental feelings than those who didn't. Were those games so awesome that they needed to be redone?   Sega's Shinobi series is a perfect example of why players have mixed feelings about this. With it, Sega yanked into the future all of the best and worst aspects of that period. It's always cool to be a ninja, especially a fast and deadly one. But the unforgiving levels, few save points, and frustrating combat that leads to cheers of joy and sharp fits of anger -- and surely broken controllers -- are all back on PS2 with Nightshade. Is that a good thing?   Just like Sega's 2002 entre, finishing this game is more of a relief than a cause for celebration and reminiscing. There is a kicker to it all too. The irony of this sequel, which is suspiciously bereft of the Shinobi namesake, is clear. Because while Nightshade may appeal to new gamers unfamiliar with the old Genesis series, the gameplay is all PS2 Shinobi -- you'll either love it or hate it. Probably both. But more than likely, it'll be the latter.   Gameplay  While Nightshade may have a different name than its predecessor, the story doesn't stray too far from its roots. Based in modern times, Nightshade follows Hotsuma's bittersweet success over Hiruko and takes up as Tokyo repairs itself from demon invasion. Just like Shinobi. Nightshade finds Tokyo a repeated victim to another breached rift between Earth and the demon world.    The Japanese government hires the Japanese ninja (or ~Kunoichi~) Hibana and deploys her to investigate a new disturbance. As she progresses through more than a dozen levels, Hibana faces waves of enemy thugs, demon things, and a small group of familiar evil ninjas at the helm of them all. As the game progresses, Hibana discovers and collects pieces of the all-powerful Akujiki (which Hotsuma wielded in Shinobi), a demon sword that sucks the soul power of both its victims and its user.    Players take on the role of the ultra sleek female ninja. If you've played the PlayStation 2 version of Shinobi you'll instantly feel at home with Nighshade. The game plays nearly identical in all aspects, except for the addition of a new kick move and a slightly different set of magic spells. The core of her moves rests in mastering the jump-jump-dash mechanism in conjunction with using lock-on. And, if anything, Nightshade's game design is even more centered on the aerial aspect of these moves.     The move set includes similar skills, so players can dash with incredible ninja speed behind enemies for instant kills, they can run on walls, they can hurl Shurikens (with a single sling or with many in a Shuriken Burst), and there is also a choice of two swords to wield. Essentially, the move set is the same, and the game feels and plays almost identically to the first.     The kick attack adds in a few new twists, and there is a healthy amount of kick juggling to be had here too. Players can kick enemies into the air, then jump into the air and slam them down, causing a shockwave, and they also can perform a lock-on aerial kick. The attack has the added benefit of destroying enemy armor. Yes, just kick their armor off. Don't ask us -- ninjas do that stuff. A trio of Ninjitsu moves rounds off the attack list with Flame, Lightning and Wind attacks by using L2 (and with Wind, by using L2 and then L1). The move set is still as clean and brilliantly fast as in its predecessor, so nothing has been lost there. And the kick attack is a good, if not all that useful, addition.   The key to everything good in Nightshade, however, is the TATE attack. Pronounced ~Tah-tey,~ it's a combination that rewards players with bloody cutscenes and gobs of points. The idea is to attack and slice an enemy and then quickly dispatch any other enemies onscreen before the TATE meter runs out. Most of Shinobi took place on the ground, and it seems Sega WOW wanted to bring this game into the air using TATE to pull themselves over chasms, moving vehicles, and across construction yards. In fact, 90% of Nightshade's core design seems to revolve around TATEs.    Using moving vehicles and especially tall skyscrapers to prove its point, Sega has employed everything from fighter planes, trains, trucks, boats and industrial cranes to get gamers into the link-along experience. In these new stages, Hibana literally jump-slash attacks one enemy after another, building an invisible albeit crooked ladder in the sky to connect the dots of enemies. Sometimes she builds it right up into the air, while other times she must repeatedly jump on building walls to get to a set of enemies placed perfectly in between two skyscraper walls. These examples are relatively familiar to players of the 2002 game, but the newest design offers moving vehicles and more air. In Level Five, for instance, players must defeat enemies on moving trucks in a tunnel. Some stand on the trucks themselves, while others are placed just out of reach. The fleshing out of the idea eventually sees Hibana TATE-ing from truck-top to truck-top to nail huge combos, while also trying to keep from falling on the speeding pavement beneath her. The rewards are huge, but to fail is to die -- and start over (again). Feeling lucky punk? You may not after a while.    The mechanic is unique, interesting and solid as combat/platform designs goes. There's really nothing like it anywhere else. When working best, players get into a rhythm and a groove that feels incredibly satisfying. The game is built with the quickest of reflexes in mind, so a six-enemy TATE may only take like three or four seconds, and when on a roll, one starts to feel as if their skills are quickly and exponentially expanding. But then, oh-so quickly, everything comes crashing back down to Earth.     The TATE system is indeed fun while it's working, but it's supposed to be based on skill. The hard fact is that luck plays a major part in succeeding in Nightshade. There is nothing better than a game that makes you work using acquired skills and techniques. But Nightshade makes you work -- and sweat -- for every last ounce of fun to the point where you're putting on overtime hours and you start to hate your boss. And quite easily you could hate your so-called job too. The ruthless one-life system means players will without question start levels over dozens of times before beating them. I generally wouldn't admit this, but one boss took my 20 tries to beat it. Twenty times! I've never died that many times fighting a boss in any game ever. Strangely, the monster-type bosses are more difficult than the human types, and they often require many dozens of dinky hits inflicting small amounts of damage -- which in turn puts players in the risk of receiving the most amount of damage.      The camera plays a big role in the success/failure of Nightshade. During gamplay, the third-person camera swings high and low around Hibana. It can get in the way and oftentimes -- because of your character's and the enemies' speed -- it misses providing the best perspective, or at least enough of a perspective. It gets worse when fighting fast bosses, and may make you break furniture or tear small dogs in half after a TATE. Remember, the TATE is a cutscene. So it gives a cinematic look at your multiple death kills. Many, many, many times I have finished a clean sweep of enemies followed by a TATE cutscene to find myself in mid-air over a bottomless pit, helpless between two vehicles or above a fiery bog of death. I'm generally pretty good at recovering, but the switching camera viewpoint is a quick phone call from Death. Is it my fault? Technically, yes. I could always strategically plan out every single attack, use the enemy toggle button, and end up exactly where I planned. But 95% of the time that's not how it works. The game is blazingly fast, you want to beat the TATE meter, and enemies are attacking and shooting things at you all simultaneously. Sometimes you die so fast you don't even know what happened. And in these cutscenes, I wish to God that the developers would in some way help land players down on safe ground afterward.    While some levels are spread out over a wider arena, most of Nightshade is based around the same dull and unfulfilling linear levels that comprised Shinobi. You walk into an area, magical walls close you in, and you must beat all the baddies until enough souls unseal it.  Sorry, but that got real old in Shinobi. So then why is Nightshade so similar? Who knows. What I do know is that the linear corridor-based level designs do not encourage long bouts of play. Coupled with relentlessly unforgiving quantities of death, I don't see how anyone who was on the border with Shinobi would come within 10 feet of this virtual duplicate of a game.    Graphics  Visually, Nightshade is almost identical to Shinobi. The game leads off with gorgeous character models and ornamental character texture design. Hibana is sleek looking in her skin-tight orange and white costume, outfitted with accessories and weapon belt, sword, butterfly-like digital headset, and sheath. Instead of Hotsuma's flowing red scarf, Hibana is adorned with two translucent sheaths that flow with similar natural fluidity and grace. They're quite mesmerizing, and overall, she is out and out a great looking character.   The enemy design is also intriguing. The first sets of low-level thugs don't live up to Hibana's ultra fine appearance, but as players progress, sub-bosses and bosses once again reunite players with WOW/Overworks' love for, and skill at, character and monster design. All of the non-human bosses are essentially some kind of mutated crustacean or insectoid -- from caterpillars to lobsters to crabs to giant insects -- and these detailed, highly segmented creatures are without a doubt eye-catching and atypical. There's a beautiful blurring of aesthetics that make regular clothing on several of the enemies look like insect wings, parts, or limbs.     Remaining consistent with its predecessor, the game unflinchingly delivers a smooth, consistent 60 frames per second, thus keeping players focused on mastering skills and not requiring them to work around the game's inadequacies. Sega's development team very much wanted a quick-reacting game with nimble, instantaneously reacting characters. Hibana's stealth attack is a perfect example of this game's speed-equals-beauty. They got what they wanted, but from my perspective, at a cost. The backgrounds and environmental design are as dull as rocks. The textures are plain, limited and repetitive, leaving little to please the eye. Whether we're talking about city skyscrapers at night, construction yards or early morning freeway tunnels, the texture work appears to have been significantly simplified to keep the blazing character speed up to par.    With the exception of some cool miniature particles during a few fights, the special effects are also kept to a minimum; there's a bit of arcade-style fire and mostly non-memorable explosions. Special effects such as reflections, water effects and lighting are all pretty much ordinary, and when they do make an appearance, they're none too memorable.    Seriously, it's a shame that after the dull looking Shinobi, one wonders what the developers were thinking? Less than two years later, so little of the game's visual design has changed -- on even a minor level -- it's almost as if they were either unwilling to change the game's staid looks, or they didn't care. Either way, if the first one looked boring to you, this second one will too.    Sound  There isn't too much fresh news to report from the sound department, especially if you've played the first. Fast-paced synthesizer-style music sets the pace for this arcade-quick game. It's as if the tunes from the original games were lifted and re-organized with more depth and sound quality. Yet, the progressions and super-fast beats haven't changed that much at all, despite the implementation of better sound technology in today's consoles. None of these songs have much sticking power, however. And unlike some of the Genesis songs in the series, players will probably not walk away singing or whistling these tunes to themselves subconsciously.   Perhaps the biggest weakness of this sequel is its lack of aural, i.e. vocal, charm. Hibana is no doubt a visually beautiful female character, and she's very Japanese looking in all of the best ways. But Sega seems to have either forgotten the game's roots, or purposefully ditched them, because Hibana's voice-over is dreadfully poor and often embarrassing. To add salt to the wound, the dialog given to her is equally as poor. Her one-liners are awkward and her observations are like B-movie one-liners that Sylvester Stallone might reject. On the technical side of things, there is little to look forward to either, as this game doesn't support Dolby Pro Logic II or Dolby Digital.In the end, aside from having a fetish for hot looking female polygonal characters, there is absolutely nothing that Nightshade offers players that Shinobi didn't. I guess that's a big ~aside~ for some of you, but come on. The unique jump-jump-dash combat mechanic is still pretty innovative and interesting on many levels, but it's implemented in many ways that are equally frustrating and hate-making. It's interesting to look at the progress of games like  Maximo: Ghosts to Glory, and its sequel Maximo Vs. The Army of Zin in comparison to Shinobi/Nightshade. The Capcom sequel softened its roughest parts (the platforming), making it a better, more likeable experience, while adding sub-quests and little extras that made it worthwhile for people who were on the border with the first one. Nightshade, on the other hand, does nothing of the sort. It is a direct sequel with 99% of the same qualities, both positive and negative. Every single flaw from that one has made it over intact from the first, unblemished. Would I recommend this game? If you thrive on super unforgiving titles that'll make you rip live hamsters in half with your bare teeth out of agonizing frustration -- and you simply have to have every ninja game on the planet, well then, by all means, be my guest. If you didn't like the first, I can easily say there is nothing that'll make you want this game the second time around.", "date": "Feb 6, 2004"}
