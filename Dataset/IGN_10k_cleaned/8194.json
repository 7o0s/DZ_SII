As stated in the all-but-written laws that govern mobile gaming, any tentpole film must be accompanied by a wireless title that serves only to prop up marketing efforts. And so, Warner Bros. Digital Distribution hired developer Universomo to craft a mobile 300 to give players an extra outlet for fighting the good Spartan fight.However, with 300, there's a catch.The game is fun.And it reveals that both Warner and Universomo put some real thought into the careful balance of preserving the spirit of the blood-soaked action movie with the limitations of mobile as a gaming platform. Rather than construct a pant-by-numbers action-platform so quickly that you can see the mortar dry while you download the game (cough, TMNT, cough), Universomo puts you into the tunic of the great King Leonindas, commanding his 300 Spartans into one of the most spectacular battles in ancient war history.After a brief tutorial that teaches you the basic, accessible mechanics of 300, you start wading into the fray. You use a nimble on-screen cursor that directs your warriors around a screen-sized battlefield. Persians pour in from all sides, but in nearly manageable waves that give the game a slight puzzle element. Direct the cursor over the interlopers and watch the clashing of swords and shields. When you ~click~ the cursor, a circle appears that denotes which enemies will be slaughtered in your charge. You want to be choosy with the cursor, as the more you press it, the smaller the circle becomes due to your conflicting orders. To make the most of your maneuvers, study the attack patterns of the Persians and then deliver orders you can live with.The warriors have three battle stances which you must cycle through multiple times as your work the battlefield. When the sky darkens with arrows, you must quickly cycle into the shield stance. If you fail to raise your shields before the archers' volley comes down, your men will be decimated. When you need to storm across the battlefield, use the regular stance for increased speed. And when the going gets tough and you must deliver a concentrated attack, flip to phalanx stance. Your warriors fall into a line and deliver a hard-charge. Use this stance not to destroy incoming lines, but also to direct traffic when larger units appear on-screen. These controls are extremely accessible, making it easy to issue battle orders.You will lose Spartans in every battle. How fast your warriors leave this earth is up to you, though. If you allow yourself to be flanked while fighting an enemy head-on in the phalanx stance, warriors are picked off one by one. Arrows will shatter your meager armor. Large units, like elephants, will trample stragglers in the regular battle stance. But losing almost all of your warriors does not spell doom. When only three remain, you fly into a rage mode and demonstrate incredible strength and valor. Your three men can tear the enemy to pieces, but are extra vulnerable to being outmaneuvered. When only one warrior is left, they go positively berserk. They exhibit superhuman fighting skills, but you cannot charge into the thick with this lone soldier lest he is overwhelmed. You must, as the game calls it, ~sting like a bee.~ use the cursor to maintain distance, striking hard at enemies and then backing off again to prevent them from surrounding you.While this carnage unfolds, the battlefield is drenched in crimson -- and it inspires you to keep pushing harder against the Persians. The more blood you see, the better you are doing in the field. Even though you are commanding small sprites, the atmosphere and the testosterone do not falter. This is a hard biting game that kept me coming back, as I really did want to run god king Xerxes' men through to return home to Leonidas' wife Gorgo.Universomo offers multiple play modes in addition to the main campaign. There is a brave stab at single-handset multiplayer, but it ultimately does not work very well. Two players control their Spartans with 4 and 6, respectively. The cursor is surrounded by a spinning arrow, and you hold down the movement button when the arrow points the direction you want to run. I tried this on a Sony Ericsson w810i -- not the biggest phone to begin with -- and found that two sets of decent sized hands crowded on a small phone just isn't workable. The spinning arrow mechanics function, but are just not fun to use. I really appreciate Universomo for trying something new, but 300 is best left as a single-player game.300 may not look like much in a static shot, but believe me, it accurately captures the feel of the movie. The battlefields were bleak. The little Spartans move across the screen smoothly and clash with Persians in neat, but slight, animations. Blood particles explode between fighting men. And while the fight plays out, music with a certain sense of strum and drang plays out in the background.300 is an exciting mobile action-strategy game that will not disappoint fans of the movie. As you command your Spartans into battle, you clench your jaw while watching your forces whittled down to a brave few. And that's when the game goes nuts. The bloody rage mode is the real juice of 300, as you enjoy the superhuman strength that desperation brings out in a warrior. The multiplayer aspects of 300 function, but are not fun -- I advise checking them out as a curiosity, but do not use them as a buying point. It's an odd thing to see a mobile game capture the spirit of 300 better than the PlayStation Portable game, but it has indeed happened here and Universomo should be commended for their efforts. If you want some more 300 to tide you over before you go see it in the theaters again, this is a good way to fuel the Spartan within.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
