It's a wrestling union that has no reservations about being more violent, more bloody and all around more crude than both the WWF and WCW put together and it's largely for these reasons alone that the ECW is on the rise with wrestling fans.   Acclaim's take on the ECW franchise is a lot like its take on the WWF one. In fact, Hardcore Revolution is developed by the same Salt Lake City studios that created Attitude, it uses the same engine, features the same play and overall look. Save for new wrestler and arena textures, audio samples, more blood and new cage and barbwire matches, this is Attitude. Ironically though, it's attitude that ECW: Revolution lacks, and fans of the federation are going to be underwhelmed by Acclaim's blatantly rushed cash-in effort.  Because Revolution is basically the company's WWF game of last year with a few additions, and because we'd like to send a message to Acclaim that this sort of regurgitated product is not to be tolerated, we've reposted a slimmed down version of our WWF Attitude review and replaced the titles where appropriate.

Faster than Attitude.   Some ECW ~superstars~ featured include:   Sabu Balls Mahoney Axl Rotten Spike Dudley Lance Storm Little Guido Big Sal Justin Credible Francine Dawn Marie Bytch Jerry Lynn New Jack Chris Chetti Steve Corino Simon Diamond Super Crazy Mike Awesome Tommy Dreamer Raven Danny Doring   Gameplay The game itself still plays like last year's Warzone Attitude with the D-Pad (or analog stick, if you're confident in your skills) and button combinations used to execute the moves. The debate over the button sequencing versus the grappling method found in games like THQ's WCW Revenge rages on but the bottom line is that Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution's control system works just fine and doesn't take away anything from the enjoyment of the game. Some of more complicated moves like The Rock's Laying the Smackdown Mr. Awesome's bomb will require some dynamic digital dexterity, but like all the best moves in the game, it will be worth it.  You will have to earn every victory since the power meters for the different wrestlers can rise and fall depending on the momentum of the match. You can have your opponent all the way down to no energy at all without even a sliver of red showing and if he gains the momentum and stays on the attack, you can find yourself pinned with a big upset loss. This happened to us in a match playing as Kane Awesome versus The Undertaker RVD and we took the loss even though The Undertaker RVD was down to no health at all and we had a good 3/4 of red life left. Tough lessons like this will keep players going against the A.I. of Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution until they figure out what works and what doesn't. Reducing the meter of your opponent's health bar is definitely an art and it will take a nice complex set of moves to do it quickly, efficiently and without losing too much health.   ^ -- Despite all of this, the Attitude engine and accompanying gameplay mechanics have lost their edge. While the create-a-wrestler mode is still fun for Hardcore Revolution, the Attitude design the game employs is both too slow moving and totally ignorant of the ECW's real extras to make Revolution anything more than last year's offering with a new skin. Sure, barbwire and cage matches are included and there's definitely more blood than seen in previous Acclaim wrestlers, but even these additions feel sloppy and compromised in order to meet a deadline. The blood is nothing more than a crude texture placed on wrestler models; the speed of the game is only slightly faster and absolutely fails to capture the intensity of ECW; the barbwire and cage matches are nothing more than new backdrops for players to look at. And what of the brutal balcony brawls that separate ECW from the competition? Where are the table crashes? You won't find them here.  Graphics The characters in Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution look better than Warzone's so the motion captured animations seem even more realistic. The movements in individual moves are a lot more natural looking and the wrestlers seem to have actual mass to them as they move about.  A running powerbomb looks great and you can almost see D-Lo Brown Raven straining to lift his opponent and run across the ring with him before slamming him to the canvas. This is a great element of realism that some fans find more appealing than the almost mechanical movements of the muscular wrestlers in THQ's games.   All of the frames of animation are present and accounted for in Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution and the framerate is smooth. This is partly because there's never more than four guys on the screen at any time and the fact that the crowd is a collection of happily assembled sprites that don't ask for much more than a good show from the animated grapplers.  Some parts of the wrestlers look a little strange at times since not everything can be detailed and visible. When you look at some of the tattoos available in the wrestler creation mode some of them look like wounds or other bad skin conditions. The scalp tattoos all pretty much look like wounds even when they're different colors other than red. They look like Vulcan wounds. Long hair looks strange as does the blood on injured wrestlers in the ring. Unnatural may be a better word than strange since anyone with hair that clings to the body like that or who bleeds giant red streaks from the side of their torso has a unique set of personal problems. These problems are all more or less forgivable since the models are so well done otherwise.  ^ --While the models generally look better than those found in a game like, say, WWF Wrestlemania 2000, and the animation is smooth, there is still an awkward side to it all  just like in Attitude. The collision detection is sometimes off and, wrestlers, which are now sped up considerably to convey that ECW action, move unnaturally quick. The background environments are all too static and the particle effects system is a joke. All the extra glitz of THQ's games is still noticeably absent here.  Sound The audio elements of Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution are outstanding from top to bottom. It's not necessarily the quality that got to us, but the variety of bits and depth of the samples that made us take notice. During matches the punches, kicks and slams all come with the appropriate sounds of impact and reactions from the assailed. The generic crowd noise is an interesting part of the game. When there's nothing going on in a little House match during a career mode, you can darn near hear the crickets outside the building. This is by design since it's the action in the ring that determines crowd noise and intensity. You're supposed to be putting on the show for the people so you've got to pull of the moves that dazzle them. This is a very good idea that will make players work to please the crowd.  Attitude ECW: Hardcore Revolution can actually seem to lack a little pizazz during those times when you're trying to move into position while avoiding the opponent. The energy associated with the game seems to really go down unless you're close to the end of a match and trying to pull off a spectacular finishing move. The crowd reactions completely dictate the excitement you'll feel playing the game but, ironically, you're the one that's supposed to do the amazing things to keep the crowd buzzing the whole time. ECW: Hardcore Revolution is WWF Attitude with changed characters, new audio samples, more blood, and all unnaturally sped up. While Attitude wasn't a bad wrestling game, it had its share of flaws, from awkward animation to a real shortcoming of character compared to THQ's glitzy wrestling series, and none of these issues have been addressed for Revolution. The fact is, what worked as a WWF game doesn't as an ECW one. Where are the balcony battles and table smashing jumps? A rough texture of blood on a wrestler's back doesn't qualify, Acclaim. Real ~hardcore~ fans are going to see right through this cash-in update. This is truly a waste of Acclaim Salt Lake City's talents.", "date": "Feb 18, 2000"}
