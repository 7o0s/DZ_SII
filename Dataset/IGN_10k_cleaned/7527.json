Inca Quest will likely remind most gamers of the venerable Bust-A-Move franchise, which has been copied many, many times in the mobile space. And while Inca Quest is easily the most attractive of the clones, this game would have been a moderate piece of entertainment if it wasn't for the saving graces of Survival mode.   Seriously, if you've played Bust-A-Move, Poppit, or whatever, you require no primer for Inca Quest. This is a classic puzzle formula without any hiccups. Colored spheres hang from the ceiling of your well; to clear the screen, you launch like-colored orbs from your ground-based cannon to create groups of three or more. If you can line up a trio in the middle of the stack, any spheres freely hanging beneath the combo also drops.   Inca Quest does add some wrinkles to the formula. Your earn bonus points for ricocheting the ball off walls. If you drop three or more like-colored spheres by slicing the pile, those rise up to the remaining mass and eliminate any orbs of the same color. Adventure mode introduces some power-up spheres, purchasable between stretches of stages, that impact game mechanics. Bombs, for example, clear out entire sections of the well. You also must contend with enemy Shamen in Adventure mode, evil beings that thwart your progress by ruining your careful strategies.   Puzzle mode offers up 100 puzzles, in series of 10. You have a certain number of orbs to use in these puzzles, but there's typically only one solution. The first few sets of puzzles are easy-breezy, but soon the game ratchets up the difficulty. These puzzles are a fine inclusion, but my favorite mode in Inca Quest is Survival.   Survival mode is a grunt challenge, tasking you not necessarily with clearing the screen, but just staying in the game long enough to move on to the next stage. The Survival stages are tough-as-nails and will take you a considerable amount of time to defeat. The Shamen will inspire horrible language, so play it in privacy.   Inca Quest is a very attractive game. Yes, the jungle temple theme may be a little overused, but it is part of the Quest franchise. The colored orbs stand out against the stone- and jungle-themed backdrops. The effects of blasting away orbs or using power-ups are nice. Inca Quest benefits on a whole from strong presentation.  Inca Quest doesn't exactly advance the ball -- this is still Bust-A-Move (or Puzzle Bobble) at its core -- but it's still a good entry in the category. Personally, if I had to pick a favorite iWin/I-play production, I'd go with Jewel Quest. Survival mode is the strongest of the game's modes; I got the most mileage out of it. This is a classic example of a 7.0 game -- it doesn't really innovate but it is hardly a failure. If you're looking for a Bust-A-Move-style game, Inca Quest is one of the better examples.", "date": "Nov 7, 2006"}
