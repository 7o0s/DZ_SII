{"name": "Chicken Run", "name_review": "Chicken Run", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/28/chicken-run-2", "text": "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Hideo Kojima should be blushing furiously right now, because Chicken Run is as bald-faced a knockoff as you'll ever see in games.  Its creators don't even seem to be interested in hiding the fact that they nicked all of its better gameplay elements from Metal Gear - at one point, we gather that the box copy was actually supposed to include the quote ~Chicken Gear Solid~ in great big letters on the back.  But it's a movie-licensed game, so you could argue that this is just adding a few figures to an originality deficit that was already there, and technically speaking, Chicken Run is a well-above-average package.  It looks very good, and Blitz has thrown in all the extra movie-license trappings - lots of FMV, lots of character voices.  But the thing of it is, you could get all of that from a two-dollar movie rental.  Could the interactive elements of Chicken Run stand on their own?  Hmmm...  Graphics  I'll get the good news out of the way first, though.  Chicken Run looks good both on its own and as an adaptation of the movie's visual style.  Our heroes and villains are surprisingly expressive for PlayStation character models - the flaws that stick out at close range in the Dreamcast version are taken as read on the venerable PS -  and the Tweedy farm is quite well-textured, with lots of odds and ends lying around the yards and chicken barracks you explore.  Every so often there's a surprisingly nice touch on top of that, like reflections in puddles or lighting effects.  Dodging the roving spotlights and Mr. Tweedy's flashlight (the latter I can understand, but why install searchlights in your farmyard?) is great in a Great Escape/Stalag 17 sort of way.  Other visual highlights come between each mission, the bizarrely-animated mini-game sequences and the Aardman-animated cinemas that show the (usually disastrous) results of each successive escape plan.  What's surprising is how well the one manages to look in comparison to the other.  The range of animation routines on display is fairly limited, since they're just brief, somewhat interactive cinematic interludes, but that doesn't mean they aren't great fun to watch.  Graphically, the presentation of the movie's look and feel is very polished.  Sound  The soundtrack is the half of Chicken Run's presentation that leaves it tipping to one side, though.  For a movie-licensed game, it features surprisingly weakly-engineered music and effects.  The balance of the game is extremely quiet.  The aural pace picks up during cinematic sequences, and the voices are extremely good.  The movie voice cast, unless I mishear, contributed new dialogue - Mac is a riot, as is Rocky, and the the rest of the chicken crew are very charming in their odd British way.  Those, however, are brief respites in between long stretches of not very much at all.  A more gripping soundtrack is among the elements that Blitz would have been very well-advised to borrow from Metal Gear.  Gameplay  Speaking of which, hey, this little radar in the corner of the screen is pretty cool.  I'm there in the middle, there are little blue dots for vital items, and when the dogs come close, I can see where they're looking.  There's this little cone showing their field of vision, it fades out at the edge of the area they can perceive, so if I just stay out of that cone, I can dodge them just fine.  Pretty neat idea, this.  It came straight out of Metal Gear Solid, true, but at least Blitz is cribbing from quality.  Other lifts from MGS are myriad: the camera shift when you press your character up against a wall is there, allowing you to look around corners; the brief alarm period when you're spotted by an enemy; and so on.  Curiously, though, the developers left out the one camera function from MGS that would have been really helpful in Chicken Run: the first-person view.  Though it seems that it would be a pretty easy feature to implement, at no time can you look at the farm through your chicken's eyes, which makes planning your route through a wide-open area more haphazard than it needs to be.  Since your view is just confined to a set radius around your bird, dogs can occasionally rush in and surprise you in spite of the radar.  If Blitz had realized that there was more to do in Metal Gear than just dodging the guards, they might have lifted enough elements from it to make their game last a little better down the stretch, but essentially there are two activities in Chicken Run: dodging the dogs and fetching stuff.  Each act of the game is built around one or several of Ginger's harebrained escape plans, from simply cutting the wire fence to going over the wall in a gigantic flying machine.  Building the contraptions in question requires that you explore the Tweedy farm and find all the different parts they require, so you set off to see what you can see, waiting for the blip of the little light on your radar that signals there's something nearby to pick up.  Frequently, you have to accomplish simple puzzles to find stuff, too, which requires the use of tools that you may have found earlier in the game.  Is this fun?  Well, it comes and it goes.  Chicken Run is at its best when its personality carries things - the mini-games that break up each act are simple button-tapping affairs, for the most part, but even if you're just tapping buttons, you're tapping buttons to carry a blundering Mrs. Tweedy lookalike down the garden path, or to launch chickens out of a high-powered catapult.  Catapulting chickens, naturally, is always good for a laugh.  But all the fetch-and-carry stuff in between wears just a little bit.  The puzzles are basic, and they're not set up very well at times, leaving frequent Infocom-esque stretches of wandering about wondering exactly where and how to apply one item or another.  Metal Gear let you shoot things and blow things up in all sorts of marvelous ways - Chicken Run's substitute is throwing Brussels sprouts to distract the dogs, which isn't quite the same. I probably shouldn't make that kind of demand on this game, though.  Goodness, it feels weird comparing a movie-licensed adventure aimed at kids to Metal Gear.  Maybe you could say that this is a Metal Gear for the younger set, since if a child tried to get hold of that one, their mothers would probably take one look at the M rating on the box and aim an emphatic ~NO~ in the direction of their offspring.But a proper kids' Metal Gear would have just subtracted the head-busting and the naked guards, not the action and quick cinematic pace that were the really fun bits.  Chicken Run actually owes a debt to a different breed of game in many of its other aspects - the aforementioned Infocom comparison is apt, as would be one to Resident Evil.  Chicken Run at least does not have the gall to assume that bug-shaped keyholes are a common feature of modern architecture, and it doesn't inspire anything close to the kind of hair-tearing that characterized the best text adventures, but it definitely borrows a great deal of the fetching and carrying of the one and the head-scratching item-based puzzles of the other.Chicken Run, then, is a very well-presented movie adaptation that leaves something to be desired as a game.  Its good ideas (the stuff it got from Metal Gear) are balanced by some elements that aren't quite so fresh and interesting - I may be spending an awful lot of time hassling the developers for taking all these concepts, but the fact of the matter is that they might have actually gotten a better game if they took even more from MGS.  Originality is good, but quality will get you farther in the long run, regardless of where it came from.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
