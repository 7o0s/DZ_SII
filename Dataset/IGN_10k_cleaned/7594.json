The company behind the wildly popular Everquest franchise was also responsible for delivering Champions of Norrath to the PS2 and Untold Legends to the PSP.  Now, SOE is making the genre leap to the next generation with their latest title, Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom.  But while the technology of the PS3 may be revolutionary, the gameplay of Dark Kingdom is definitely rooted in some stale current gen elements.   Connected to the other Untold Legends titles in name only, the storyline behind Dark Kingdom, is a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption.  The game takes place in the land of Dureth, which is undergoing massive rebellions by barbarian hordes and other forces.  The king sends his elite unit of warriors that draw essence from fallen enemies, known as the Dragon's Shade, to quell the uprisings and restore peace to the land.  However, as the warriors set out to eliminate the barbarian threat, they discover the reason behind the unrest: the land has fallen under darkness, with strange creatures slaughtering innocent civilians and wearing the armor of the kingdom.  Even worse, the king is behind the devastation gripping his realm.  Sworn to protect the land from internal and external threats, the Dragon's Shade members vow to restore peace to Dureth and stop the king at all costs.    What follows is a 15-18 hour adventure through various locations such as ruined cities, underground caverns and outposts.  Players can select one of three warriors from the Dragon's Shade to play as: the strong Warrior, the nimble Scout or the powerful Mage.  Additionally, you'll be able to select one of four difficulty levels to give yourself a challenge along the way, which is a nice addition to replayability. All three follow the standard archetypes that their character class suggests.  The Warrior can take a ton of damage and unleash pain with his massive war hammer.  The Scout is extremely agile, and can slice and dice enemies with her dual blades.  The Mage uses both a staff during close encounters and powerful spells to pick off opponents from far away. Along the way, each character has minor deviations to the plot that makes their fight for their kingdom unique from their Dragon's Shade companions.  What's more, you may stumble on various bits of lore that add to the backstory of what's been transpiring in the land of Dureth, which is a nice touch to the story.   Initially, it would seem like all three characters would play differently from one another, and they do -- up to a point.  The Warrior causes the most damage, but he's much slower than the Scout, who can get a lot more hits in a shorter amount of time.  Both of them are weaker with their individual spell attacks, where the Mage obviously excels. However, once you jump into battles, you'll quickly find that much of the fights degenerate to button mashing of either light or heavy strikes regardless of the character chosen.  Most of the time, you'll simply chain together the X and Square button in varying presses to trigger different combos (which are shown at the bottom left hand side of the screen), and while you'll wind up gaining new combos over the course of the adventure, you'll typically wind up relying on a few effective blows for each warrior to smash your way through every opponent. Even the Mage, who could be seen as the weakest hand to hand combatant, is more than capable of handling himself in a toe to toe fight with the various living and undead monsters you take on.     As you destroy the beasts that infect the land of Dureth, you'll gain lots of experience that can be used to level up your characters, increasing their stats and bolstering your spells.  Each one of the nine spells included in the game can be leveled up five separate times, and by the end of your adventure, you'll be powerful enough to handle just about anything the game is ready to throw at you. Of course, you'll wind up using mana to cast these spells, and inevitably you'll wind up taking damage.  Fortunately, you won't have to worry about collecting health or mana potions thanks to the orbs that are released when you defeat enemies or break objects.  Red orbs provide health, while blue orbs replenish your mana and yellow orbs boost your essence.   Essence is important, because it can be used to support your characters in a variety of ways.  Since there are no shops in Dark Kingdom, you'll use essence at checkpoints to generate new armor pieces, weapon enchantments and restoration of depleted health or mana.  You never actually receive new weapons in the game; instead, your weapons change to reflect the enchantments that you've placed on them throughout the game. To a degree, you won't necessarily run dry for essence, since you can always recycle superfluous items that you've collected for this precious material.  Plus, essence is typically the item that you'll receive whenever you break boxes or rocks, so you will usually have more than enough to last you from one checkpoint to the other as you fight across the land. Fortunately, you won't be forced to continually fight alone against the hordes of evil creatures. Every now and then, you'll find a number of companions that will fight with you, ranging from animals to peasants that you'll equip with confiscated weapons and armor and even your fellow Dragon's Shade warriors.  These moments are scattered across the entire adventure, and while you won't be able to control some of these characters (apart from directing some to follow you or wait in one spot) it can be nice to have a hand against some of the monsters.    While Dark Kingdom is a hack and slash, you're not constantly fighting your way through every level.  Each area has multiple quests that you'll wind up fulfilling, such as turning a number of valves or triggering switches.  You'll also run into a number of puzzles that you'll have to solve.  These aren't extremely hard to figure out, but there are some mild brainteasers that will give you a diversion from cutting a path through creatures.  There are also a few action elements, like using peasants to trigger gates that are creative.  One sequence, however, will probably infuriate a lot of players in the caverns: there's a certain crystal collection quest that you'll need to take on, which triggers an Indiana Jones-like sprint down a tight cave which requires literal split second timing and some luck to survive.   So where does Dark Kingdom go wrong?  Well, apart from the repetitive combat system, there's a ton of gameplay issues that you'd hope would've been fixed with the transition over to the PS3.  Load times are surprisingly long when you're accessing new levels.  The three playable characters can get hitched up on just about any environmental object or level design piece.  Rocks and boxes, as well as hills or background objects can cause your character to freeze in mid-jumping animation for at least five or six seconds. Many of the environments aren't interactive.  For example, you'll notice leaves melt through the ground instead of landing on it, and you can't wade through tall grass and have it respond to your motion.  About the only thing that does respond in this manner is water, which has a similar textural viscosity as that found in Norrath on the PS2.    The draw distance for the environments is relatively shallow, so you'll notice a ton of pop-in, particularly with enemies.  It's possible to run into what appears to be a clear area only to have threats materialize from nowhere.  This is different than monsters being summoned into the playing area; this is literally stumbling onto opponents that weren't there a second before. You'll also run into a lot of camera problems during combat, where the camera will unexpectedly zoom in or out during a fight, which will definitely throw you off because you might not see where blows are coming from.  The camera will also get stuck on environmental objects or get obstructed by trees or other items, so you will have trouble seeing clearly.  Finally, you'll run into slowdown, particularly if you trigger a destructive spell on a large number of enemies.   This is particularly disappointing because the visuals for the game have definitely come a long way since the infamous first images of ~Boxguy~ were released to the public.  The detail on character models is a lot sharper than previous screenshots have shown, and particle effects are pretty good.  This is somewhat tempered by the overabundant use of Havok physics, which will cause character models to splay out awkwardly across the ground as they're beaten to the turf. While the voice acting still leaves a lot to be desired, the orchestral score, delivered by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, is very nice.    Now while all of these problems currently exist, there's one other thing that some players may find a bit curious.  Unlike other launch titles, Dark Kingdom is one of the few that isn't including motion sensitivity via the SIXAXIS controller.  You won't be pushing the controller to cast spells or hack skeletons at all, nor will you be recovering from the effects of an attack by shaking the peripheral.  That may be somewhat disappointing for some, considering that most of the other games are using the feature to some degree.   Apart from the game issues, Dark Kingdom includes an online experience that should be rather engaging for players. Up to four characters can adventure through the lands of Dureth, and unlike other titles, you're not forced to start over from scratch with a new party of warriors.  Players can choose any saved game from the single player experience and start a multiplayer game from that save point, which will give your friends a chance to experience the title from a later section of the game.  What's more, you can you're your progress and then take that offline into the single player version of the game. You'll also be able to recruit your friends in one of two ways: you can add them from your friend's list on the console, or, if you have an Xfire account, you can invite friends from there.  While SOE has claimed that they will also support the game with additional downloadable content, such as new items, and perhaps even new characters and missions, this content wasn't running at the time we published this article.  Perhaps the downloadable content will even be able to fix a number of the aforementioned bugs in the game.Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is probably one of those games that will appeal some players because of its content and replayability.  However, if people are looking for a true next gen action RPG experience, they're not going to find it here.  Plagued with current gen issues and repetitive combat, Dark Kingdom feels like it was ported over to the PS3 from a pre-existing console. While some of these issues might be changed with further downloadable content, the original game will probably only satisfy the diehard action RPGer.", "date": "Nov 15, 2006"}
