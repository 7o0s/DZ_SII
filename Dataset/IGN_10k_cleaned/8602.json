Rather than just cut-and-paste the aliens on a basic pinball table, Taito fills the screen with moving targets superimposed over a cosmic background -- much like the original coin-op. The result is actually a visually compelling game that, at first blush, should please both pinball and Space Invaders fans.   Unfortunately, the game is undone by wonky physics that turn Space Invaders Pinball almost into a game of chance than of skill. Video pinball is always clipped because it's awfully hard to replicate the real-world physics of an actual table, but in this mobile game, the divide is just too vast. You rarely know exactly where the ball is going to go, reducing the game to something of a button-masher. Just jam on the flippers when the ball closes in on the bottom of the screen and hope for the best.   The pinball table is broken up into two boards. The main screen is a table that takes up the entirety of your handset's real estate. Instead of a plunger, you use a cannon to blast the ball into the table. Alien invaders and UFOs hover just above the table and you must slam them with the ball to defeat them. You can earn bases that plug up the shafts that would normally result in a lost ball alongside the flippers. Multiball and other bonuses are also attained by hitting a series of three yellow arrows at the top of the screen, lining up matching symbols that start a power-up.   The second screen is a boss battle of sorts. A giant alien slides across the top of the screen, occasionally revealing a weak spot on its base. You must flip the ball into the weak spot several times to defeat it.   Space Invaders Pinball is actually a very attractive game, thanks to great use of color and some very nice sprite work. The sound isn't too shabby, either.  Space Invaders Pinball really could have been a fun pinball game -- the theme is implemented quite well. But the physics is so bizarre that you'll throw your hands up after just a few balls. At times, the balls get trapped in an arc that criss-crosses the screen several times before unceremoniously just dumping it close to the gap between the flippers. It's very frustrating and I'm sorry that I cannot recommend it.", "date": "Jun 6, 2007"}
