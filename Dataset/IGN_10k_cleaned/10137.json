At least that's how Iridium Runners sees it anyway and it's tough to tell if the decision to make a futuristic kart racer sans karts was either a refreshing one or simply a laughable lapse in judgment at the hands of Italian developer Playstos. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.    If nothing else, Iridium Runners -- so named because racers run around tracks littered with the titular element that gives them temporary speed boosts -- manages to carve out its own little budget-priced niche in the overcrowded racing genre. There's almost something charming about the game's attempts to ape some of the futurescapes of games like WipEout, plastering ads for imaginary corporations all over loading screens, and at least trying to give some backdrop to a bunch of spandex-clad, svelte little hoof-pumpers.    Multiplayer madness. Iridium Runners is a budget title and in nearly every respect it feels like one. It doesn't look particularly impressive (though it sports modern visual ~features~ like excessive bloom), it doesn't run all that quickly (though the latter stages hint at what could have been in some interesting track designs and moments of decent speed) and the power-ups merely add a frenetic element to the races. Although, there are moments where it's possible to go from fourth to first as you scream across the finish line, and it's just as easy to drop back at the last second, keeping most races tight and exciting.   If it sounds like I'm not quite ready to write the game off, it's because there's earnestness to the effort. For every bit that should doom the game to being just another bargain bin bit of schlock, there's something oddly endearing about Playstos' effort. It's not enough to elevate the game to the point where I'd recommend it to most, but at a bargain price it just about manages to escape being a total rip-off, and demonstrates that Playstos may have set the ground work for an interesting little diversion should they decided to revisit the franchise later on down the road.    At the core of the game's appeal, you're going to have to do something your thumb probably hasn't done since the days of Track & Field: you're going to button-mash like crazy. Yes, there are weapons and power-ups, but they're tired standbys like shrinking all the other players (Mario Kart, anyone?), grabbing a shield, or firing off rockets. No, the real draw here is in relatively careful management of energy levels. See, you have to hold down X to run anyway, and since the racers kind of handle like they're all a little drunk, one must balance the incessant tap-tap-tapping of using up turbo juice after picking up Iridium reserves with tight cornering. Just the process of running drains the energy meter too, so near-constant Iridium pick-ups are required, not just for turbo sprints, but to keep the juice up to the point where turbo dashes are even unlocked.   And they're off! There's also another wrinkle: sooner or later on every track, you're going to have to jump. Yeah, you read that right; there are light platforming sections during races. It's a simple tap of the R1 button to pull it off, and it's not until the last of the tracks that jumping becomes more than a simple interruption of the constant X mashing, but it's actually rather fun -- particularly when coupled with the fact that you can use the shoulder buttons to dash sideways into other racers and stun them. Slamming into another human player right before they hit a pit, if done right, can slow them down just enough to elicit a stream of colorful sailor speak while you zip right past.   That is the game's one saving grace, too: it's actually a decent multiplayer experience. The single-player offerings are strictly barebones stuff; you've got your one-off races, your career paths and your throwaway ~collect stuff scattered around the track~ and elimination variants. Despite the different racers' apparent stats, I never really got the feeling that they were terribly varied beyond, ~ooh, that one has tig o' bitties!~ Yes, I speak like a 15 year-old. Often. Twistier tracks lead low-handling characters astray, but other than that, I opted for aesthetics over anything else.The fact that gamers desperate for something a little different can plunk down an Andrew Jackson, walk away with the game and still have a little change left over should be an indicator of just how high the game reaches. $15 is the perfect price for a title that doesn't really do anything especially new, yet still feels unique. If you've got three friends, some money to blow and maybe adult beverages at hand, you could certainly do worse than Iridium Runners.", "date": "Mar 5, 2008"}
