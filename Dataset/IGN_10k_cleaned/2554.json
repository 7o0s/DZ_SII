{"name": "Mad Maestro", "name_review": "Mad Maestro", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/14/mad-maestro", "text": "Mad Maestro, if nothing else, is to be applauded for attempting to raise the musical consciousness of the gaming population.  We've had music games with generic rock (Guitar Freaks, Rock'n Megastage), music games with really bizarre rock (Gitaroo-Man), music games with mutant hip-hop (Parappa the Rapper), and more than a few music games with hideous Eurobeat and Japanese pop (u-pick-em), but never a music game with orchestral classics, providing you discount the zero-profile Japan-only Konami release The Maestromusic.  Mad Maestro doesn't quite go all the way and provide full orchestral performances -- the music is obviously digital -- but it's certainly a step forward.  As a game, though, it's pretty thin, despite the addition of a few new gameplay features and the usual abundance of out-to-lunch style.  Watching the green Jell-O aliens and guys in lion costumes jam with the band is fun, but as always, you're more or less just tapping buttons, and in this particular case the button-tapping has very little leavening to make it interesting.  The test of a good music game, I suppose, would be whether you'd rather buy the game than a soundtrack album.  In the case of Gitaroo-Man or Dance Dance Revolution, I know I'd rather have the game.  In the case of Mad Maestro, the question is a little less clear, especially at full price.  It's possible to complete the game the first time through in two hours or so.  Getting better grades is another matter, of course, and leads to more unlockable fun stuff, but you need the cake before the icing comes into play, and there's better cake out there.  Hm.  Cake.  Where's a bakery when you need it? Who's your favorite composer?   Gameplay  Ahem.  Mad Maestro, being a rhythm game, requires you to accurately press buttons in order to direct a virtua orchestra correctly, keeping to the tempo and playing their notes at the appropriate volume.  Its principal tool for this purpose is the Dual Shock 2's analog buttons, which can register varying levels of pressure -- that corresponds to piano, forte, and whatever is in the middle.  I quit taking piano lessons more than 10 years ago, so the lingo is a little rusty at present.  Mad Maestro's indicator bounces around three, four, or five dots, which represent the beats in the piece of music being played.  Usually there are four of them, 4/4 time being the most common musical structure, but some pieces vary the number of beats to a measure and thus demand greater attention.  In any event, those signal when you have to press a baton button, and their color dictates the amount of pressure required.  The distance between dots varies throughout the song according to the tempo of a particular passage.  The dots are close together during quick sections, distant during slower ones, and the circle expands and contracts from measure to measure.  This is the main wrinkle thrown into the mix, since harder songs go from fast to slow and back very suddenly.  Some beats require that a direction be held while the baton button is pressed, but that's not very hard to deal with.  What is a little hard to deal with is the interference from the background graphics.  Some stages with slower songs -- ~Swan Lake~ is a good example -- don't distract from the game interface, since the scenery is relatively peaceful.  When the realtime backgrounds get too busy, though, it can sometimes be hard to follow the indicator as it bounces around, especially when the tempo is bouncing up and down very quickly.  Crazy background hijinks are a staple of the rhythm action genre, and Mad Maestro features some great ones (the alien landing is a treat), but there's still a balance to be struck between visual entertainment and potential frustration.  There is also the question of longevity.  Mad Maestro has 10 bonus games to unlock, and 35 songs total, but not as many levels -- certain levels cover as many as four songs in total.  They stretch awfully long at times, and the repetitive inputs tend to drag after a little while, while some of the digital arrangements of these songs don't do very much to hold your interest.  Essentially, the game doesn't do enough to add to the music.  Graphics  The visuals make a go of it, and those succeed to a greater degree, with ridiculous designs doing a fair bit to make up for the occasionally crude execution.  Dancing aliens and circus lions performing motorcycle stunts as the orchestra plays make for one of the more unusual theatrical experiences on PlayStation 2.  Even the character designs that aren't meant to fly over the top have a pleasant degree of personality.  Takt, the conductor, conveys a neat air of artistic temperamentality.  The interface design is pretty sharp as well -- the gameplay overlays are effective most of the time (the font used to describe your progress is a kick), and the menu between levels features a 3D representation of a conductor's study that grows more and more crowded as the number of orchestra supporters swells.  This is still not what you'd call a showcase of the PS2's capabilities, however.  The framerate is solid, but that's on account of the blocky models (or flat in the case of most audiences) and extremely basic textures.  The cartoonish style that the designers were presumably going for comes off effectively, but the same could be said for Herdy Gerdy or Jet Set Radio, and those look a good deal better.  By the same token, the animation is amusing, but very, very simple.  It feels a little silly picking graphical nits in a music game, but this could definitely have looked better while staying true to the intended visual style.  Sound  Some of you may find the idea of synthesizing classical music to be an iniquitous aesthetic choice.  In this case, it probably wasn't so much of a choice, more like a requirement for the dynamic mixing to work right and provide the necessary failure cues to the player, but the point may stand in some quarters.  For my part, the only problem is that it often doesn't have the weight and volume of a real orchestra.  If you've heard one live, you know -- they're very, very loud when they want to be (not quite live-punk-next-to-the-amps loud, but plenty loud).  In contrast, hammering as hard as possible on the forte sections can still produce a thin sound from Mad Maestro, even during heavy Wagner pieces.  Beyond that, there's a good selection of music, both in terms of its breadth and quality.  It's mostly classical and romantic, but there are a few steps outside that mold, and for digital renditions these don't sound so bad sometimes.  As mentioned before, the game also does a good job of reflecting the player's inputs, altering tempo and volume accordingly.  There are cute effects for when you screw up, naturally, matched by disastrous animations on screen (the lion crashes his motorcycle, say).  Voice acting is confined to the cutscenes between each level, and as such you can probably live through it.  Much of it is not so good, but not to an offensive degree -- the game is so silly that there's very little to spoil. Very little.  Hm.Both of the debut Fresh Games titles are aimed squarely at a very small niche, but of the two, Mad Maestro probably misses by a greater distance.  50 dollars can buy you an amazing amount of classical music if you shop around, so do you really need a rhythm game to go with it?  For that price, considering what it offers in terms of window-dressing around the game, Mad Maestro doesn't feel like that great a deal.If it ever gets marked down, though, this is goofy enough to be worth a look, and it's not a bad rental at all -- you could probably finish the main story mode before it came time to return the game.  And it might inspire you to spend that extra money on a little great music, which is something most of you could probably stand some exposure to.", "date": "Mar 14, 2002"}
