There have been a few surprises from the bundles of Tony-clones, most notably Acclaim's excellent Aggressive Inline. But most of the copycats have been garbage.   Now along comes Midway's Freestyle Metal X, and admittedly, it's a little late to the party. However, it's a solid offering that sets itself apart from the standard motocross formula. FMX is trick-based, not a racer, which is a fresh take on the genre. The control is a little tough to master at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be popping tons of tricks and catching some massive air. Let's take a closer look   Gameplay  Mat Hoffman was Tony on a bike, Johnny Mosely's Mad Trix was Tony on skis (kind of), and FMX is going to be called Tony on a motocross bike. While the games are structured similarly, with challenge-based career modes and licensed athletes, but they are different in a couple of ways.   First off, motocross is a motorized sport, thus the name. Motors require fuel, and clutches, etc. Strapping a motor to a set of wheels (and expecting a human to ride it) requires things like padding and shocks. These two realities had to be addressed in the game, so instead of one standard jump button, there are a couple of things one needs to do right in order to make the bike go.   To get a burst of speed, which is the only way to go fast enough to launch for major air, you have to clutch. In order to do that, you must hold down R1 and allow the meter to fill, then release to take off. When it's time to jump, you need to preload your shocks in order to be ready to spring at the top of the jump. This is handled on the L1 button. Therefore, each time you go to take a jump, you have to remember to fill both meters, and let them out at the appropriate times. It takes a lot of getting used to, so the tutorial level is an absolute must. In fact, you may spend half an hour there just getting used to things.    The trick system is also a little tough to master. Instead of pressing in a certain direction, and then pressing a button to perform a move, the commands must be tapped, as are the special moves in Hawk. Then, to modify a trick, you must tap in a different code and press Triangle. This makes for a lot of tapping, and a lot of memorization.    Doing wheelies and stoppies in between air maneuvers can link tricks. This allows for some serious combo action, but also makes for a lot of tapping, and a good deal of precise timing. While a lot of aspects of this game (like landing) are thankfully forgiving, the wheelies and stoppies are not.    This kind of learning curve with the controls is annoying but forgivable when a game is fun, and FMX definitely is. There are tons of different modes to explore, and even more to unlock. The main career mode is the meat of the game, and it provides enough action and challenge to keep you busy for a dozen hours or more.    The levels are arranged much like Aggressive Inline or Tony Hawk 4. When you begin, you can just freestyle around and get an idea of how the level is laid out. Then, when you're interested in making some progress, just ride up next to one of the objective honeys and talk. She'll give you a mini-mission like knocking over a water tower, jumping through a helicopter, or making an insane leap between rooftops. Some of the challenges are pretty easy, but a few of them will have you pulling out your hair. The more of these you complete, the more stuff you unlock. Finish enough challenges, and you can move to the next level.    The levels are large and diverse, and for the most part, they're a lot of fun to explore. The game does a nice job getting you high in the air; and that makes for a good deal of 3D play. It's just as likely that you'll be ripping around on the roof of a skyscraper as carving up a dirt track. There is a good flow to the levels as well. It's easy to link strings of tricks using the environment, or you can choose to stay in a specific place and tear it up for awhile.   Apart from the Challenge portion of each level, you can choose to compete in a Big Air competition, race and freestyle. There is also some great pass-the-controller Party Games, which fall into the same categories. Trying to top your buddies in the Big Air competition smacks of Hawk's trick attack or HORSE modes, and it's a lot of fun. But perhaps the best little multiplayer feature is a mini-game called Human Darts. Reminiscent of Super Monkey Ball's Monkey Target, it's wicked fun. The object of the game is to drive your bike forward, then stop and hurl your rider over the handlebars at a huge target below. Wherever he lands is how many points you score but you have to aim the rider as such to avoid the large floating mines that hover in the abyss. It's simple, it's morbid, and it's addictive as hell.   To extend play even further, there's a Level Editor that allows you to set up, play and save your own FMX courses. This is also similar to Hawk in its arrangement, and it works quite well. There is also quite a large canvas to paint with ramps, obstacles and dirt, so amateur course designers will have a lot to do.   Bottom line, FMX is fun, challenging and surprisingly deep. Take some time to learn the difficult controls, and you'll love the game.    Graphics  Whomever did the caricatured sketches of the riders that accompany the level menus - take a bow. Those sketches are a whole lot cooler than the normal character models you see in games of this ilk. Actually, they're a whole lot cooler than the character models used within the levels of this very game. The stylish (albeit garage) flair of the menu caricatures does not extend within the gameplay. In fact, much of the visual creativity was checked at the animation booth.   In game, things look pretty drab. That's mostly due to the textures, which really aren't up to par with recent offerings on the system. The character models are okay, but as we mentioned above, it would have been nice if they'd been infused with the personality displayed in other parts of the game.    On a positive note, the animations of the riders and bike are nice, especially the bails. One can tell that rag doll physics were a high priority here. You need only play a couple of rounds of Human Darts to see what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, effects were not such a high priority. The blood smears are often polygonal, and some of the water effects just look bad. There is also a little slowdown and some pop-up, if you're keeping score at home.   All of these things can be disregarded, of course, unless you are a graphics snob. This game is a lot of fun as is. Better graphics would have improved it, but its visual shortcomings don't do much to inhibit the enjoyment.   Sound  In my opinion, every game (even Final Fantasy) should have ~I Wanna Rock,~ by Twisted Sister in its repertoire. ~Ace of Spades~ by Motorhead doesn't hurt, either. Vice City had the Sister track, and Hawk 3 had ~Ace of Spades,~ but neither of them had ~Kickstart My Heart.~ FMX has all three, plus many more excellent tunes. Here's the rest of the lineup:~Overkill,~ Motorhead  ~Speedfreak,~ Motorhead  ~Crush 'Em,~ Megadeth  ~Peace Sells,~ Megadeth  ~Devil's Island,~ Megadeth  ~5 Seconds,~ Shortie  ~The One,~ ShortieIn addition to these great tracks, there are unlockable songs. It's tough to imagine a more perfect soundtrack for this game, unless it could include Yngwie F'in Malmsteen.   The rest of the sound isn't quite as good as the soundtrack. With the exception of a cool ~Bill and Ted~ guitar lick when you fill your radometer, the sound effects are pretty uninspired. The growl of the motorcycle engines-- differentiated as they are-- is the only persistent sound in the game. There aren't many layers here. Music tracks, the buzzsaw of the engine, and an occasional sound byte when taking a challenge is all you're going to get. Just turn up the tunes and rock it, I guess.While it won't win any beauty contests, and the control is a little tough to master at first, Freestyle Metal X is unique in that it is a trick-based motocross game. Most of the others, including the trick-heavy Freekstyle, have been racers at their core. This is fresher.FMX is nearly an 8, and should appeal to extreme sports game fans across the board. Even if you've been bored with the recent crop of X-titles, check this one out. It's wide-open, fun and has a good sense of humor, to boot. Besides, who can resist the allure of Motley Crue, Megadeth and Motorhead contributing heavily to the soundtrack?", "date": "Jun 30, 2003"}
