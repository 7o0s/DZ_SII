It's coming out hot on the heels of both Halo 3 and The Orange Box, the two biggest shooter releases of the year on Xbox 360 (let's not forget that Call of Duty 4 is just around the corner as well). Could there be a more intimidating time to hit the market? These games, after all, have been critical and commercial successes of the highest order; must-buys for pretty much everyone with a 360 system. The question is, then - are there any 360 owners out there craving more shooter action, and just as importantly, still have money to spend? We're sure both developer Saber Interactive and publisher Sierra Entertainment are asking themselves that same question right now, and while we won't know the answer for a few weeks or even months, from our perspective we hope the answer is yes, because TimeShift doesn't deserve to be overshadowed.   You probably all know the game's storied history; its protracted development cycle, platform shifts, and one complete overhaul (and with it, a one year development extension) just as the game was on the verge of being finished. All that, however, is in the past, and we're left to judge the game on its merits alone. Thankfully, this is one of the few instances where we can say that the many delays and eventual overhaul of the game has been for the better. TimeShift won't change your life, but it's a pretty damn good straight-up shooter.   In fact, while the game's major 'hook' is its implementation of time control in combat (you can pause, slow and rewind time), the designers haven't gone overboard with it, instead using the time powers mostly to accent the already-solid combat. In single player, your time control powers are actually less tactical than you'd expect, which is in no way a bad thing; controlling time here is used less to outwit the guards and more to simply kick more ass.      While you can do things like pause time and take the weapon out of an enemy soldier's hands and duck around behind him (to which he'll respond with a moment's confusion, before going for the nearest weapon he can see), or rewind time to a point before the guards spotted you, the reality is that you're far more likely to be using it in a purely offensive manner: to help you burst from cover and even the odds against a swarm of guards; to freeze time so you can quickly rack up a series of quick-fire headshots; or, best of all, to revel in the rag-doll glory that is blowing the hell out of enemies in slow motion. There's something beautiful about watching dead bodies and gibs arc gracefully through the air in slow motion. It's a graceful ballet of violence then you go and spoil it by trying to speed them on their way with an extra rocket or two.   Time 'puzzles' pop up relatively regularly throughout the game but they're really basic - freeze time to walk across electrified water, freeze time to get through a door before it shuts, and so on. Like we said, time control is really all about kicking butt, and that's fine by us because it's complemented by AI that does a good job walking the fine line between 'believable' and 'fodder'. Enemies communicate with each other really effectively, and use a few different tactical options to take you down. In this game, dying simply means that you get to try another approach, and with regular checkpoints you're not often frustrated.   In addition to your precious time control powers, you'll also be toting a pretty comprehensive set of weapons. You can carry three at a time (along with up to three sticky grenades), so it's entirely possible to have a weapon for every situation. The most straight-up loadout would be the fully automatic power of the Shattergun (aka the shottie) for close range, the Karbine, with its alt fire grenade launcher for mid to long range, and the crossbow for shits and giggles. Nothing like detonating someone into a shower of blood with an explosive tipped bolt from halfway across the map. Of course, from there you can mix and match, swapping in the likes of a rocket launcher, sniper rifle and more. Although it takes a while for your options to expand, the weapon lineup is nothing if not dependable.    The level design is a slightly mixed bag, with a tendency to lead you from room to room at times. See those doors with green lights above them? Yep, they're the ones you can go through, while the orange doors are impregnable although guards will often spawn in from them. You'll also notice that giant mechs have a habit of coming along to knock out a chain link fence or chunk a big hole out of a nearby building in order to give you a path forward. Screen-filling mechs; is there anything they can't do? So yes, the game is linear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. While it can be a little annoying not having any room to forge your own path, TimeShift does balance the more corridor-based sections well with more open, dynamic areas, as well as incidental details that flesh out the world, such as the reactions of the prisoners in their cells as you move through. You can choose to observe them, or just pass by.   The actual settings are nicely varied. From the rubble strewn city streets and chaotic construction sites early on, you'll move through the aforementioned prison (where you, erm, don't rescue anyone), into the very Nazi-esque headquarters of Krone Corps and out into the wilderness on a rescue mission. The pacing is really good, even if you're not given much motivation story-wise, and the visuals are often bordering on stunning.     In fact, the one year makeover of TimeShift has really put it up there with the prettiest games on the system. TimeShift sports some of the best water effects we've ever seen, from the intensity of the rain as it pours down (and yes, you can pause the rain and look at the way the world is distorted through individual drops) through to the way water gushes out of pipes and splashes on the ground. The lighting is similarly excellent - real-time, self-shadowed, the whole deal. The team has used chain-link fences and grated walkways very well to highlight how well the real-time lighting throws shadows, and in the early urban section, the regular lightning strikes illuminating the scene are nothing short of stunning.    In other areas, however, the game is slightly more patchy. While some of the scenes of urban destruction are fantastic - plaster peeling away from the walls, tiles missing from the ceiling, detritus everywhere and smoke pouring from windows, other sections don't fare as well. Like many next-gen games, the textures in some places have a tendency to be too shiny or bumpy, and there's a slight disconnect between some of the earlier steampunk design elements and the more gritty new look. Still, you'll probably be too busy marveling at the excellent depth of field effects when using the weaponry, or watching gibs fly to care.   Where time control in the single player game helps expand your palette of options in combat, it really shakes things up in multiplayer. Rather than having 'universal' time control - i.e. you hit time slow and the whole world slows apart from you, in multiplayer you use 'Chronos grenades', which allow you to throw out a bubble of altered time. Catch an enemy in a time stop bubble for instance and you can just plug away at him, lining up bullet after bullet (or even better, rocket after rocket) on the edge of the bubble, then when time resumes, they all hit. Similar deal with time slow; you'll see the person trapped within the bubble desperately jumping, trying to get out, giving you a precious second or two to try and take him down. Time reverse, on the other hand, forces anything inside the bubble out, and its advantages are les immediate, but you can do things like run through a narrow corridor and throw a time reverse behind you to prevent anyone from following, or hit a flag carrier in CTF with it to separate him from the flag.    Indeed, the more you play, the more you realise how many options open up through the time powers. Know someone takes the same route through a map each time? Set up an ambush around a corner - just drop a time stop and fire a couple of rockets into it. Hell, you can even use a time reverse bubble as a makeshift bounce pad. This is one of those games that's just going to get better and better the more people play it in multiplayer. Sadly, we've only had a handful of sessions, but we're hanging to play some more.   TimeShift ships with 14 maps, and in addition to the usual array of game modes - Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and CTF, it has a couple of aces up its sleeve. King of Time is a brilliant mode with everyone battling to become and stay as king for the longest. It's all on one, but the king is immune from the effects of time bubbles, so can freeze enemies in their tracks and step right in to deliver the killing blow from point blank range. It's a great balance and heaps of fun. The other mode that's a neat twist is Meltdown Madness. Think a CTF-style map layout with two bases, but at each base there's a reactor with a ten minute timer on it. The aim is for your timer to hit zero first. How to do that? By getting over to your opponents' reactor and hitting it with time slow and time stop bubbles to slow and halt their countdown respectively. Of course, you're also defending your own reactor, as well as trying to collect time canisters, with the end result being a hectic, but satisfying mode. Again though, this is a game mode that's going to benefit from everyone knowing what they're doing.     It's a great range of modes, and once you factor in an incredible set of tweakable options, you can really put your own spin on the multiplayer game. Settings can be changed on the fly too, so if you're not happy with your low-grav/steel skin/rockets only combo, you can quickly change it up. Plus, as you'd expect, you can save your custom settings for future use.    While we'd love to declare TimeShift's multiplayer one of the best experiences of the year, we really can't. Not yet anyway. As mentioned before, we simply haven't spent enough time with the game (one of the pitfalls of reviewing before it hits retail) to learn the nuances of all the maps, modes, options and abilities. Will the maps stand up to long-term play? We simply can't say. It's definitely looking good though. One thing we would say now though, is that it's definitely the smaller maps that gain the most from the time control powers - the Chronos grenades become a powerful weapon in small rooms and corridors, whereas they're easier to avoid and harder to use on the handful of wide open maps. As a result these maps feel a little more vanilla. Still, things are looking good for the game's multiplayer. Think Unreal Tournament with a serious twist.  TimeShift may not be Halo 3 or The Orange Box, but with its entertaining single player game and cleverly implemented multiplayer, its well worth a look. In fact, with a decent online community this could become one of the most interesting multiplayer shooters out there. Still have doubts? Chances are theyll disappear around the time you sticky grenade an enemy twenty metres into the sky in slow motion, separating him from his weapon, which spins gracefully through the air into your waiting arms. Or perhaps itll be the first time you stop an opponent dead in his tracks with a perfectly thrown time stop bubble and unload clip after clip into his soon to be dead body.
