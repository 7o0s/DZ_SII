Riddle me this: What was the name of the Brown Bird whose leg Ross broke when she was trying to sell him cookies?   If you said Sarah, this is the game for you.   If you have no idea what the hell I'm talking about, good.   Friends: The One With All the Trivia is a quiz game that combines all of the entirely useless knowledge from 10 years of Friends episodes into one ridiculously hard trivia game. Seriously, this game is incredibly hard. I've seen my fair share of Friends because I watch TV occasionally and it's on all the damn time. But even after having seen countless repeats over the past decade or whatever, I'm still at a complete loss as to what 96.2462% of these questions are referring to. Even the easiest level is fairly hard, but at least it's doable.    The game does a pretty good job of tying in a decade's worth of Friends content, providing video clips, audio samples and such to go along with some of the questions. So you might see a clip that shows Ross picking his nose or something, and then it'll say, ~What happens next?~ Does he throw up, chug a bottle of Maker's, take a mid-afternoon nap or eat it? If you guess correctly (because honestly, only people who've watched the DVD sets 42 times will know many of these answers) you'll win! You win nothing, of course, other than a promo movie for the game itself, telling you how great it is. Fantastic, since you would have already bought it.   With as hard as the questions are, most of which usually leave you scratching your head, some of the questions are followed by some sort of some sort of explanation, be it a voiceover or a movie clip. This part is cool, but only a small portion of the questions are actually followed by explanations. I'd like to see the clip where Monica spits on some dude in a restaurant, but unfortunately, they didn't feel like including that one.   The Friends game lets you play with up to four players, or alone, but unfortunately the actual game itself is really weak. Every question that you answer correctly simply lights up a window on an apartment building, and the first person to light up all the windows wins. It's entirely unexciting, and only outdone in its boringness by your prize, the aforementioned behind-the-scenes stuff that usually just sells the game.    There's a whole lot of content in the game (over 3,000 questions and 700 clips), but the actual wrapper around all of it, the part you're interacting with, is about as basic as possible. It's functional, yes, but that's about it.Friends: The One With All the Trivia is filled to the brim with content and hard-as-hell questions, but that's about it. The front-end could have been made in Flash, and it'll just bore you to death. If you're a massive Friends fan and really want to test your knowledge, you might have fun here. Everyone else, including casual fans of the show, should pass.", "date": "Nov 14, 2005"}
