The Price is Right had more flash, and Press Your Luck had far more originality, but there was always something engaging about the Family Feud.  You could do worse when you were stuck at home with nothing to do.  Well, you could, anyway.  Once upon a time, it was hosted by such mighty game-show legends as Richard Dawson and Ray Combs, truly towering figures in the annals of trash TV.  Not so anymore.  Now, the face and voice of the Feud is provided by, of all people, Louie Anderson - as you may recall, the star of the old Saturday morning cartoon Life With Louie.  This may simply be the beginning of the Feud's problems, though...   Graphics  Admittedly, it was a long time ago, and I most often watched the show while I was sick and home from school, but I don't remember the set of the Feud looking anywhere near this ugly. The 3D set looks terrible, and the FMV sequences featuring Louie are repeated far too frequently, especially considering his limited repertoire of soundbites.  You can only hear him say ~Good Answer!~ so many times before the sight of his gap-toothed visage and the sound of his high-pitched voice start to wear just a trifle.  What's more, there were some pretty hideous human specimens on the show from time to time, but the polygonal character models in this game are something else, featuring neither aesthetic creativity nor anything vaguely resembling technical competence.  The cast of the Feud are misshapen, sharp-edged, ill-textured potato-beings.  Gameplay  It's the Feud.  If you had better taste in television when you were younger, a primer.  Two teams of five compete to guess the most popular answers to an open survey question.  To begin with, there's a face-off, where two opposing members attempt to buzz in and pick the most popular answer.  Whichever family wins that competition gets the chance to either try to guess all the answers themselves (thus winning the round), or challenge the other team to guess them all.  If the team that plays that particular round makes three wrong guesses (or ~strikes~) the other team gets a chance to ~steal~ - if they can guess one of the answers that's up on the board, they win the round.  This process is translated faithfully to the PlayStation - sometimes too faithfully.  The interface for buzzing in and answering questions works well enough, and the game is fairly forgiving about recognizing your answers.  However, the game progresses awfully slowly when you're playing against the computer, because there are no options to skip through the AI team's rounds.  In other words, if you lose the face-off, get ready to sit tight for a little while, through loads, FMV sequences, and other stretches of dead air.  There should have been a way to fast-forward through the empty bits.  That wouldn't do any good in a two-player game, though - either way, somebody's going to spend a lot of time doing nothing.  Other issues arise beyond this one, including a fairly limited variety of questions (I hit a repeat question in my third game) and bizarre AI behavior in the face-off - it seems like they don't even try to buzz in.  Which I suppose is a blessing, though, considering what happens when they get to play.  Sound  Clap, clap, clap...aaaaaaaw...~Good Answer!~...*bang!* ...*slump*...  The one aural solace I had hoped for from this game, the classic twanging hillbilly Family Feud theme, appears to have been discarded from the Louie-led vintage of the show.  Bastards. There are better game-show games, better game-show conversions, and let's be blunt, a nigh-infinite better things to spend your money on nowadays.  Let's can my nostalgic baggage for a little while and ponder whether anybody watches Family Feud any more anyway.  This is an utterly mindless experience for one player, and if you've got friends that you want to play with, You Don't Know Jack is a much better choice.  So don't bother, even for the bargain price this one's liable to be offered for.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
