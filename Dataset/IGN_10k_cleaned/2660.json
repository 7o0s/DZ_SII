As cool as the game looks on the surface, it's very disappointing how much Tiger Woods is missing...one single course is just not enough for a decent golf experience these days. Features One course (TPC Sawgrass) 12 PGA professionals  PGA Tour and Challenge Modes Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridges) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  UK developer Rebellion was assigned the task of recreating the familiar Tiger Woods interface and gameplay on the Game Boy Advance hardware. The game features the same three-click swing that's been used and tweaked endlessly in EA Sports' series for years, and it works just as well on the GBA. The development team lifted a couple of swing animations from the console and PC versions of the game, giving an almost video look to the motion. It's pretty sweet to watch.   On the fairway, the game does a nice job portraying the game of golf...if the course was slashed and burned before tee-time. The game engine doesn't offer any course-side objects or foliage, so you won't be driving the ball over (or into) trees or shrubs. The game is streamlined and fast-paced since you don't have to deal with any obstacles, but then again, it's not an accurate simulation by not having them in there in the first place. The physics model on the ground is a little on the tight side...the ball doesn't roll too much on the fairway, but at least the model alters the roll appropriately when it lands in rough or in the trap. And the wind will definitely carry the ball if it's blowing...so enough attention was spent getting many the ball motions correct.   The putting game is much weaker than Tiger Woods' driving/pitching game...you'll never really go more than two strokes on the green because the developer oversimplifies the physics model of the putting. The ground slope doesn't really come through on the Game Boy Advance's LCD screen...but it's not so important since you can literally slam the ball into the hole at near top speed. Sure, the putt can roll over the hole or hug the rim when it's overshot, but generally a direct, hard shot is enough to sink the ball.  But as a golf game released in this day and age, it's missing a lot. Most noticeably, this Game Boy Advance golf game has only one course: TPC at Sawgrass. A fine course in its own right, and it's nicely rendered in Rebellion's golf engine on the GBA...but it's absolutely inexcusable for a console golf title to be released with only 18 holes nowadays. Some Game Boy Color games have had more courses. And if it was a matter of licensing issues and cost for Destination Software to include more, there wouldn't have been anything wrong with one or two unlicensed fantasy courses to shake up the variety. It's not like they can make add-on cartridges for additional courses like they do on the PC, you know. By only offering one course to deal with, Rebellion severely limits the game play options of Tiger Woods. The PGA Tour option, for example, is simply two rounds on the same course, and all of the twelve different challenges take place on the exact same 18 holes. Once the lay of the land has been learned, it's a cinch to get through every single game option in this rendition of Tiger Woods.   There are other minor but important omissions/issues that pop up in Tiger Woods. Hit the ball in the drink, and you're forced to hit it again from the same spot...you're not offered a drop. In multiplayer mode, you can never win honors...player one always goes first, player two always goes second, etc. You cannot get a decent, full-screen, overhead view of any of the 18 holes in the game. And Tiger Woods doesn't have any of the usual golf offerings, like a Skins Game (playing holes for ~cash~). Destination Software foot the bill on a cartridge-save EEPROM, but didn't put it to appropriate use beyond autosaving after each hole in the PGA Tour. As much as we appreciate that ability guys, we'd also like to save our statistics...you know, longest drive, longest putt, best round...that sort of thing.   For what Destination Software and Rebellion offered in Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf, the game is decent fun...for a very, very short time. Only offering one course in a golf title is just unthinkable, and seriously brings the review score down. Two or more courses, and this game would have been graded an easy 7. If the other gripes had been addressed, we would have been looking at the top golf game on the GBA. But when you can master the game in a single day, the replay value falls considerably. Multiplayer support definitely adds value, but not nearly as much as including additional fairways to whack a ball through.", "date": "May 13, 2002"}
