Whenever the company finds something that'll sell, it does its best to milk it for every penny that it's worth. Capcom is doing it right now with everything from Street Fighter to Resident Evil and apparently plans to do it with one of its newest franchises, Onimusha. And the franchise that it's been doing this the most with is undoubtedly the company's legendary Mega Man series.   Since the first Mega Man was released on the NES in December of 1987, we've seen more than 20 new titles from Capcom with the little guy's name in it. If my memory is correct (and I'm sure I'm missing something), the NES had Mega Man 1 - 6, the SNES saw Mega Man 7, plus the first three games in the Mega Man X series, the Game Boy and Game Boy Color featured around six different Mega Man titles, the N64 got Mega Man 64, the Game Gear and Genesis sported Mega Man Wily Wars, and the PlayStation was blessed with Mega Man 8 and Mega Man X4 (both of which also appeared on Saturn), plus two Mega Man Legends titles. And now, you can add Mega Man X5 for the PlayStation to that already long and distinguished list of games.    Gameplay If you're at all familiar with the Mega Man series, you know that it's not really known for making any revolutionary steps forward from game to game. And if you're hoping for X5 to bring you an all-new gameplay experience that wasn't offered in X4 or any of the previous games in the Mega Man X series, you'll be deeply disappointed with this game.   On the other hand, if you're a fan of the little blue guy and don't need any revolutionary new features to enjoy his latest adventure, then Mega Man X5 will likely be right up your ally. The game is setup the same basic way as just about every other Mega Man game that my senile little brain can remember, as it starts you off by offering the player with the choice of eight different bosses/levels to tackle and, as is customary, Mega Man or Zero will gain the special powers of the boss after it is destroyed.   Levels can be completed in any order and it's also even possible to progress past them and straight to the final stages of the game if you wish to do so. Of course, this would mean that you wouldn't have any of the special powers from the level bosses and it'd be pretty near impossible to make it through the final encounters without cheating by using codes or a cheat device.   The game is quite challenging, especially if you choose to use the armor-less Mega Man or don't go out of your way to find each characters' armor power-ups, the control, level design and general play mechanics offered is some of the best that the series has seen. Nothing is really new here, except for the fact that Mega Man and Zero can now both duck, but there's nothing really wrong with that. To put it simply, the game is a blast to play through, offers a lot in the way of challenge and extras items that can be found, and is a brilliant 2D action game.   Graphics Why is someone still doing a 2D, sprite-based, side-scrolling action game on a system that handles 3D as well as the PlayStation? Well, because someone upstairs must still love me. Quite honestly, when gaming evolves to a point where there are no longer any 2D games being made at all, it'll have passed this gamer right by.   Mega Man X5 definitely isn't the best looking 2D game ever and isn't quite the 2D visual masterpiece that is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but it still looks damn good. The backgrounds are vibrantly colored and look fantastic on the whole, even if they could've used some additional layers of parallax for effect, and the characters and enemies are nicely animated and well drawn. Mega Man and Zero have plenty of cool little standing animations are just animated well in general. It's a really good-looking, classically designed, 2D game.   Sound In the same way that the game's visuals take you back to the days when just about everything was beautiful in their hand-drawn glory, the game's musical soundtrack has that same exciting old-school feel. The music has that same classic sound associated with most games on the SNES, but much clearer and fuller sounding than you could ever get on any of the 16-bit system. The music is very upbeat and simply fits the style and the atmosphere of the game perfectly. In fact, the score is good enough to listen to by itself outside of the context of the game. The sound effects also have that old-school feel to them and, just like the music, fit the mood of the game like a glove.  If there's one point that I'd like to make really clear with this review, it's that you shouldn't buy this game if you're hoping to get something entirely new and innovative. If you're tired of Mega Man and are done with playing 2D games in general, this doesn't have anything that will bring you back. However, if you're like me and love Mega Man and 2D action games in general, this is a must-have title. This is 2D action gaming at its best and I'll take this over almost any 3D adventure game or platformer any day of the week.", "date": "Feb 3, 2001"}
