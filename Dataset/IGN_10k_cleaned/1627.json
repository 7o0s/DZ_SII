Those who don't do a thing, those who get by, and those who make a difference.  After playing Sno-Cross Championship Racing, I've determined that, out of the three, I'm surprisingly most pissed off by the kids in the middle of the road.  Reason being that I feel sorry for the ones who can't, inspired by the ones who do, and with a game like this, downright disgusted with the ones who can, but don't.  To put it bluntly, with all the other AA racing titles out there, I don't see any compelling reason to give this title so much as a peripheral glance, much less make it the focal point of your purchasing power. It's not so much that Sno-Cross is a horrible title, but it is the type of horribly mediocre experience that typifies the half-assed Dreamcast development that is flooding out of 3rd party published under the guise of ~support.~ It's one thing to shove a game like Tony Hawk out the door making little to no use of the Dreamcast's power, but that title had, well, gameplay... And SCCR?  Well, the snow textures look OK.  But outside that, this game is terribly uninspired. Let's start with the visuals.  This game is more blocky than a bucket full of Legos, folks.  The tracks are all incredibly simplistic and indicative of a complete lack of any real imagination.  Granted, you don't exactly have much to work with in a snowmobile sim, but if a game like SSX can come out of relative obscurity and make the snowy wilderness come alive, then why can't Sno-Cross? As it stands now, we have no real short cuts, no cool surprises, and very little in the way of trips off the beaten path.  So much for edge-of-your-seat racing.  Much like the track design, the game itself is laughably rigid. The game is so angular, and almost everything from the rider models to the track borders themselves look very stiff and unnatural. The game also throws in shadows all over the track, but when you see the sunny, happy daytime texture in the background, you realize these shadows have no earthly reason for being there, and are just sort of thrown in for show. It may have worked on PlayStation, but on a platform where so many titles are using effects to add to the atmosphere of a game, effects that actually highlight the complete lack thereof end up doing more harm than good.  The same could be said for the game's control.  If we didn't know any better, we'd say Sno-Cross is trying hard to pass itself off as a sim, but to be honest, the control fails to provide much in the way of fun.  Things are far too slippery, and hitting walls is the only real alternative to slowing down to make a turn.  Obviously, you want avoid walls, so instead, you have to race like grandma, and as much as I want to tear through the snow at a mind-numbing 15 MPH, I'm sorry, this was just boring.  The funny part is, even if I wanted to watch the action, the camera is too high on cooperating. It is very stiff and trails the vehicle so closely that it is often difficult to make out where you are going next.  This is an especially noticeable setback when you're hugging a wall in a tight turn, because you can hardly ever see where you're headed, further removing you from the task at hand.   And the AI doesn't do much to help things, either. The field isn't very crowded, and unlike the live-action intro footage, the pack seems very spread out and the vehicle are almost too large for the tracks, so what you're left with is a race filled with competitors that are few and far between.  I just never felt like I was in the heat of a tight race, and as a result, this game never gave me the competitive fire that drives most good racers.  Even when you catch a glimpse of someone else, you can rarely catch them, and even if you have it floored, you'll get passed.  The worst part is, about the only time you'll overtake someone is if they wreck.  Sounds fun, huh?  Well, OK, it doesn't really sound fun at all.  And to be honest, if you take one thing away from this review, it should be that.  Sno-Cross Championship Racing just isn't any fun.  I don't care if you like snow, snowmobiles, or if you think you were a snowmobile in a past life.  This game is boring, ugly, and a perfect example of everything that is wrong with 3rd Party Dreamcast support.  Sno-Cross looks and plays like a poorly executed PlayStation title, and if I really wanted that, I'd go bask in the disappointment of my PlayStation.  But if you're looking a quality next-gen racer, then we'd advise you keep right on looking. Booooo!  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 12, 2000"}
