Despite the fact that Nintendo triumphantly announced SingleTrac's N64 developer status two years ago, non-cutesy vehicle combat games have somehow never found their way onto the console.Thank God for Activision. Following the successful release of the Luxoflux-developed PlayStation car combat game earlier in '98, the US publisher has finally gotten its butt in gear and brought the game to N64. The good news is that not only has the game retained its destructive gameplay and cool graphics, but Activision actually managed to improve the game in both the control and the multiplayer department.GameplayVigilante 8 is a lot like its grandfather and inspiration, Interstate '76. Both games are set to the backdrop of an American wasteland. Both games revolve around weapon-based, stylized vehicles with loads of horsepower. And both games involve plenty of killing. Interstate '76 (PC) saw players battling out it in a bleak 70s alternative and Vigilante 8, a home-console sequel of sorts, takes place in the same era -- a flailing US deprived of oil and filled with ~motor-terrorists.~ Imagine Twisted Metal (not Twisted Metal 3, please). Now add detailed graphics, arcadey car physics and a strange background story.The idea behind Vigilante 8 is simple: drive, explore, protect and destroy. Players, riding around in souped-up muscle cars, acquire various weapons of destruction and then blow the hell out of opponents and stationary targets.Players select from a lineup of 12 vehicles, each with its own special weapon and cheesy '70s driver, including trucks, Mustang-lookalikes, and even a full-fledged school bus. Depending on your choice of driver, the mission objectives range from destruction of gas stations or enemy installations to protection of a bank. Once you have completed a driver's mission, you will be treated to a few prerendered pictures that describe what happens to the character -- then move on to the next one. Finishing single player quests will open new levels and drivers and eventually open up cool secret stuff, including a Mario-style Dream Land stage and the ability to play as an alien UFO.The game's diverse 3D levels are vast, very post-apocalyptic and filled with structures -- whether they be buildings or oil barrels -- to explode. Weapons include machine guns, missiles, rockets, cannons, mines and more. Some weapons allow you to lock on to your enemy at the simple touch of a button and then unleash heatseeking missiles or blow them to smithereens with an auto-target laser beam.If you're looking for racing action, then this is definitely not your game. Vigilante 8 is all about destruction and mindless fun. The controls can be a little frustrating at first (even though they have been improved over the PSX version), as Vigilante 8 features a ~relaxed~ physics model. Cars can easily pull of 180s, fly through the air for a long time and even be flipped over by rocking back and forth when landed upside down. But once you accept that it's not about Gran Turismo-like precision, this game rocks and delivers exactly what it's supposed to: mindless, explosive fun.MultiplayerIn addition to a solid one-player mode, the Nintendo 64 version of Vigilante 8 improves on the PSX game with four-player split-screen action, more deathmatch modes (Brawl, Smear and Survival), and even co-op battling. The two-player mode offers the option to switch between a vertical and a horizontal split-screen, depending on the player's preferences. As with most titles, the framerate takes a definite hit in the multiplayer modes, but the game is still a blast to play. If you're into multiplayer deathmatches, you've got to give this game a look.GraphicsLuxoflux has put together a game that looks a lot different from the usual N64 fare. Everything appears appropriately smoky and dark, given the game just the right ~post apocalyptic~ look. Fogging is kept to a minimum, but instead V8's developers have implemented a funky LOD system that fades out the environments' textures in the distance to boost performance. It looks a bit clumsy and causes the occasional flicker, but it's really a small sacrifice. In return, N64 owners get stable environments with detailed textures and an immense amount of detail. You will see tumbleweeds rolling by (that even stick to your bumper if you don't watch out), a western train, snow blowers, lots of signs, buildings, fences, airplanes, hills, trees, and so on. Besides the third-person view, players can also select a first-person view complete with steering wheel and hands (not available in the multiplayer mode).But the game's biggest attraction is the fact that you can blow up or damage virtually everything. Why can't other games do this? Houses explode, windmills topple, trees fall over, rocks and oil tanks roll down the hills -- it's a joy to behold. Best of all, the game's cars show realtime damage as windshields crack, bumpers come loose and doors swing open. Sweet.On the downside, the spire explosions needed some more work, V8's framerates aren't always stable and we could have done without the overblown lens flares that not only affect the framerate, but aren't all that great looking due to the N64's nasty dither filter. Sadly, the PSX's cinema sequences have been replaced by JPEG still images. They get the job done, but have that same dithered look. Nevertheless, these are only small chinks in V8's graphical presentation. There is no doubt about the fact that this is a beautiful game.SoundPlenty of explosions, cool engine sounds and creaking car noises are just what the doctor ordered to drive your neighbors crazy. As a matter of fact, we're surprised Luxoflux was able to pull off the audio in this game so well, considering the N64's limitations. On the music-side, the developers opted to replace the Redbook audio tracks of the original with newly composed midi tracks. Nothing special, really, but it sounds convincingly '70s and can be switched off if it's not your cup of tea.Peripheral SupportVigilante 8 supports the 4MB RAM Expansion with an optional medium/hi-res mode. The increased resolution reduces the dither patterns on screen, but it also cuts down the framerate. Since the game looks good enough without the RAM boost, we suggest playing it in standard resolution.Woohoo! I've been waiting for a Twisted Metal-style game to hit N64 for a while and Vigilante 8 will do just fine. I would have been happy with a port of the already fun PSX game, but the N64 version actually improves on the original with much better multiplayer options. The graphics are cool (there's nothing like driving a car with its trunk clattering and the bumper falling off), the sound is above average (although some of the voice samples get old quickly) and there are plenty of different vehicles and stages. The only major complaint I have is that the action gets fairly repetitive after a while -- a flaw seemingly inherent in the genre. The mission objectives differ, but things don't change much. Luckily, the multiplayer mode easily makes up for this limitation.An oustanding first title from Luxoflux. Now bring on the sequel.", "date": "Mar 20, 1999"}
