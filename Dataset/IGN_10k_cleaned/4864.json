Although they can be quite technically complex, it's also possible to just hop and fly around (or blow stuff up, if it's a combat sim). Yet there's a daunting breadth to the genre as well, and Xtreme Accuracy Shooting is pretty much at the end of the spectrum. It represents not only shooting range simulation, but a subset thereof--competition bench rest rifles. As such, it will probably appeal only to a small crowd of fans. It's budget-priced and has some pretty low hardware requirements, though, so those who have been looking to get better at shooting at the range might want to take  a look at this one. The manual alone seems to be a well-informed and educational guide to the shooting range. Unfortunately, it's on the CD as an HTML file, but hey, that's how they can price it to move.  Unfortunately, the manual doesn't go a long way toward introducing the sport to a beginner. If you don't have much experience with rifles, this sim and its documentation won't do much for you. If you go out hunting or to the range every once in a while, you'll still be hard-pressed to wend your way through the casual jargon: ~One [action], an octagonal-designed receiver made from 7075 T-6 aircraft-quality aluminum with chrome-molly inserts at all wear points where the barrel is threaded into the receiver. The advantage of this action is its large footprint for a better and larger bedding surface. It is also thought that the coefficient between the action and the scopes being made of the same material also enhances the overall performance of the BR rig.~  Now, while the bench rest rifle veteran will likely be nodding his head through all this, the gamer will be nodding off to sleep. It's well written and informative, but, like most of the rest of the material, it's geared towards someone with a higher degree of familiarity than you're likely to find north of the Mason-Dixon. Some sacrifices need to be made in order to reduce packaging costs, but one of the sacrifices here is excising accessibility.    Getting to the digital shooting range is easy enough, and your selections can be automated. And it's a good thing, too, because the average Joe won't know neck tension bushing, be familiar with the five different types of powder, the number of clicks for powder amount, or seating depth. The manual goes to exhaustive lengths explaining each gadget you'll find on the workbench (flash hole tolls, arbor press, case-neck brushes, case trimmers), but doesn't discuss the performance differences of the different types of power, neck tension bushing, powder clicks, or seating depth.  There's also a chart at this stage that lists the shooting range's humidity, altitude, wind, temperature, and a couple other parameters, but it's not clear in the game or documentation how much these factors affect what kind of cartridges you should be choosing. You can make batches of up to ten cartridges at a time, or make two and a time and use trial-and-error to find the best materials, but there are too many variables.  Once you actually make it out onto the range, you'll be either delighted by the ballistics accuracy and adherence to tournament guidelines, you'll be amazed at how dated and crudely serviceable the visuals are. All the player will see is the field in front of him, with the scope taking up the majority of the screen. On the right-hand side of the screen is a column of icons that you click on to individually tweak your aim left and right or up and down, adjust the scope independently, load the round, and actually fire.  This segment of the game is surprisingly accessible and intuitive, in contrast with the workbench. It's too bad that the ground texture is a blurry smear of camouflage colors, that the gun model is blocky and has an odd perspective, and that the hand that does all the adjusting and loading is just kinda ugly and oddly colored. The sound consists of some announcements from the range officers, followed by monotonous albeit stereophonic popping noises that caused one person in the office to half-jokingly mistake this game for a hammer simulator.  There was also a problem with our ATi rig (while using the latest official driver set). The 3D shooting range did not render at all, instead being replaced with a blank, white wall that made us mistake the game for a spreadsheet. We installed and ran it on one of the nVidia rigs and didn't have any technical difficulties.When it comes right down to it, the best part of this game is the informative manual, which would have been ever better had it come with a glossary. Aside from that, Xtreme Accuracy Shooting is too narrowly focused and visually dated to appeal to the general gaming audience, and it doesn't explain quite enough about bench rest competition to attract those already familiar with shooting (assuming they too could look past the blockiness and poor textures). As a simulator of an niche sport, it seems pretty solid. As a game, though, the selectiveness of its niche pummels the overall fun factor.", "date": "Jul 28, 2004"}
