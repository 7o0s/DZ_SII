Developed specifically for the PSP by the newly-christened High Impact Games (former members of Insomniac themselves), this latest Lombax and robot adventure is outstanding fun. In fact, the Hollywood-based studio's rookie effort is one the system's best titles thus far.   A primary reason that Size Matters is so good is because it matches its console inspiration almost exactly. Though it wasn't developed by Insomniac directly, you probably couldn't guess it unless somebody told you. In short, High Impact has done a great job of emulating the famous Ratchet and Clank engine while successfully modifying it for handheld play.    That downsized success is probably Size Matters' biggest victory. It's not often that a developer can take a game that's been designed around two analog sticks (and eight action buttons) and move it to the PSP without noticeable problems. But the team behind Ratchet Portable has done it by designing an extremely smart camera that follows the action in an effective way. The POV isn't perfect mind you (your viewpoint can and will get stuck on certain structures when traveling in close quarters, or when you're surrounded by huge groups of enemies), but 90% of the time it works just as you'd want it to. Even when there are problems, however, users can always pull the Right and Left triggers to manually control the direction of the camera, or tap select to switch to first-person mode for fully rotational examinations.   Solving the problem of how to handle the loss of an analog stick means that the rest of Size Matters works beautifully. Though it lacks some of the finer ~FPS-inspired~ control options of the more recent console editions, Ratchet PSP still feels and plays like all of its predecessors. The hardest move to perform in the entire game is the long jump (L + R [brief pause], X) but pulling it off isn't a problem after a few practice runs. Other than that, it's as easy as breathing to swap between weapons, strafe (via clever alternation of the analog stick and d-pad), and do everything else that Ratchet has always done. It gets a big ~thumbs up~ in the control department for sure.    But let's assume that you've never played a Ratchet and Clank title before -- if that's the case, then you'll likely want to know what it is that ~Ratchet always does.~ In truth, he does a little bit of everything. Though the game's primary focus is shooting and hitting bad guys with occasional platforming situations, Size Matters also boasts a number of other gameplay styles via Ratchet's robot sidekick, Clank. When players assume that secondary role they can do things like access smaller out-of-the-way areas and control other robots to solve puzzles. Clank can also become an enormous war machine that launches into space Star Fox-style for a surprisingly fun reflex-heavy mini-game (sadly, there are only a couple of levels to enjoy it with), or hop into an arena and participate in all-new variations on classic gaming themes (like bumper cars and Lemmings).   As is always the case in Ratchet and Clank, though, the standout gameplay element in Size Matters is your access to multiple off-the-wall weapons. This arsenal can evolve to become bigger and more powerful too, with both experience points and purchasable add-ons providing plenty of enhanced kick. But even without those upgrades, Size Matters' guns are far from ordinary. For every laser rifle (Lacerator) and Shotgun (Concussion Blaster) at your disposal, there's a firearm that shoots killer robots (Agents of Doom) or a pistol that unleashes a swarm of killer bees. More than a dozen of these wacky weapons can eventually be unearthed in total, and when combined with the huge amount of upgrades, become increasingly fun to use.    Even more impressive is the fact that Ratchet and Clank's story and presentation are almost as strong as their gameplay. Though the plot is a little on the predictable side (after all, every R&C title has a twist that changes your view of certain characters halfway through), the pacing is still good, the voice acting is solid, and the humor is quaint and upbeat. Regrettably, there are occasional hiccups in the audio department if you switch between menus too quickly or resume a game post-sleep mode (i.e.: the music won't play for 20 seconds or so, and sometimes you'll experience a sudden ~silent~ moment), but for the most part everything works splendidly -- particularly in regards to load times: they're quick in just about every situation.   Size Matters also deserves some kudos for its visuals because, in several ways, it outdoes its PlayStation 2 brethren. To be more specific, there's almost never a drop in the framerate regardless of the situation, while both the artistic and technical quality of friends and foe alike are quite high. My favorite visual memory, though, occurs when Clank is shooting in space. At his busiest, our robot buddy blasts dozens of enemy ships at a time, while special effects, particles, and lighting tricks dance around without at hitch; it's really quite impressive.    But impressive doesn't even begin to describe what Size Matters actually offers. Besides the rather hefty single-player quest (which needs to be played through multiple times in order to get everything), there's also a robust multiplayer mode that supports both Infrastructure and ad hoc competition. Multiple skins, nicely balanced weapons, and some sweet maps really show off what the PSP can do when pushed and there's still more to talk about. Hidden Skill Points, collectible Titanium Bolts, Armor upgrades (and hidden sets), and a myriad of other extras are also included.Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters has everything a triple-A PSP game should have. It's packed with fantastic single-player content, has a strong multiplayer element, boasts a great visual and thematic presentation, and excels with razor-sharp gameplay mechanics. Sure its camera may cause problems here and there and its originality suffers when compared to earlier R&C titles, but at the end of the day, Size Matters is still an excellent way to exploit ~free time on the go~ and it's one of the few PSP titles out there that really shows off the system.", "date": "Feb 9, 2007"}
