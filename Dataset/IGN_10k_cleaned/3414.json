This is not a fancy game in the least and by all rights it could easily have been a PSone game, but after digging into it, that doesn't really matter. This is bare bones tank combat with loads of cartoonish attributes that clearly show that the developers had a good time making this. If you have a few bucks in your pocket and want something that's short and sweet, check this out and enjoy this fine little war.   The first thing anyone would notice about Seek and Destroy is the graphics: they're terrible for a PS2 title. The artists devote an astounding few dozen of polygons per tank for a look that makes you think they'd modeled the tanks with folded bits of paper and modeled them from there. Only this time the paper versions would be better since they could get regular cylinders for the tank barrels. The rest of the game fares just as well with low-resolution textures and minimal special effects. There may be 100 tanks in the game, but the visual variety is barely visible.    Intentionally or not, the graphics serve to focus all the attention of the game itself and it manages to hold its own surprisingly well. The left analog stick controls movement in a tank-relative way so that pushing up drives the tank forward no matter which way it's turned. The right analog stick controls the turret and a total of three weapons can be mapped to the face buttons. The last one is reserved for special power-ups such as kicking in a hover or flight ability. That's right, these tanks can fly around. They can also get a chainsaw attached to the front for some up-close combat. That's how serious this game is.   The best part about Seek and Destroy is how all he missions are simply about going in and messing everything up. Tanks and planes can be blown up and nearly every building can be turned into rubble. With unlimited ammo the only thing stopping the destruction is the reloading time. Not much thought is really required and it doesn't matter. Just get a couple of decent tactics together such as avoiding a rush into a crowd of tanks, and you're good to go.   At first, the combat is a little shaky since it can be difficult to accurately aim the turret and drive and fire at the same time. It's nearly impossible even. But with the auto-aim upgrades the game gets much easier and allows for some massive battles and circular attack tactics. Once the best auto-aim upgrade is put on the tank the game is a cakewalk right through to the end, but this isn't about a challenge, it's about some good old destruction and it works.   With 100 tanks and a large collection of upgrades for the tanks that can be bought in stores there's plenty of tweaking that can be done for the best fighting machine. This is necessary up to a point. As said before you can finish with a tank setup that's earned halfway through the game. This means that there are more improvements, but they're up to the player to get for multiplayer battles and not necessary to finish the single-player game.For a few bucks, Seek and Destroy delivers a lot more than you'd expect. The graphics are an embarrassment to the PS2, but the tank combat is so straightforward, fun, and goofy that this game earns its keep. It's not too long, but the multiplayer opens it up for playing with some friends who miss the days of playing combat on the Atari 2600.", "date": "Feb 3, 2003"}
