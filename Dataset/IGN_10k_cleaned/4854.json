With the Xbox RPG lineup split between some of the very best RPGs of all time (KOTOR, Morrowind) and the true dregs (Metal Dungeon anyone?), it was only a matter of time before a few average RPGs began to show up on the list to split the difference. Welcome, Sudeki, an RPG that manages to create an absolutely balls-on fantastic combat system only to stifle it with some very plodding, predictable, and overall uninspired RPG elements. That's not to say Sudeki isn't worth your hard earned bills, but buyer beware, this is not the game of the year, or even the game of the summer.  The better parts of the story of Sudeki can't be revealed without spoiling the last third of the game, but it actually isn't a bad overall concept, it's just the storytelling itself that ends up falling a bit flat. You play as four different characters (Tal, Buki, Ailish, and Elco) who team up to uncover the mystery of otherworldly beings literally dropping in from the sky. Is it an invasion or something else? While each character has some backstory -- Tal's father is a great military leader, but a real jerk and Elco lost an arm, but was saved by the Queen -- none of them are examined very deeply and most never receive resolution. Tal, for one, never has any true final confrontation with his father and, in fact, his dad Arlos -- who seems like he'd be important to the overall story -- disappears about halfway through the tale and never reappears. As Chekov (the writer, not the Star Trek dude) once said, if you show a gun hanging on the wall in act one, it should be loaded in act two and fired in act three. A lot of subplot seeds are planted, but few sprout.  In the Final Fantasy games, characters are given significant histories and characterizations, each with an inner or exterior conflict that is resolved through lengthy dialogue or through actions taken in the game. While this can be a turnoff for those who hate the story aspects of RPGs, if you're gonna be putting four characters together and offering the illusion of a significant backstory for each, then it has to be fully realized at some point. FF does it as do most traditional RPGs. The characters overall don't feel nearly as fleshed out or vibrant as they could be. Big, big ups, however, to Climax for ensuring that none of the four characters come off as whiny, annoying or as the typical reluctant hero. In fact, there is some weight behind Tal's personality, some depth, but again it just doesn't really finish out. The same can be said for the other three characters.

The characters meet in a safe non-combat city where they can talk to various locals for some added color, side quests, and information. There are chests to open, vases to smash for coins, and crates to kick in hopes of finding a valuable item. After finishing off some minor RPG necessities in the town, the fab four are sent to another area. The journey to that next area is essentially a linear path with loads of enemies popping up on the way to the next safe city locale. Nothing wrong with that set-up at all, just be aware that you aren't going to have a Morrowind experience. That's fine by me, since I actually enjoy traditional RPGs over completely open games, so long as the story can drive me from point to point, which Sudeki does with mild success.    In town, when talking to people, you'll get full voice-overs and a very short dialogue tree, which doesn't really have any branching paths. The locals tend to have a lot of flavor in the earlier areas, but a lot less in the darker sections of the game. The voices are very solid overall, with Climax opting to create a sort of European League of Nations with a slew of different accents for the main characters and NPCs. While some of it can be a little cheesy, it definitely lends some personality to Sudeki. Occasionally the dialogue offers a bit of humor, even double-entendres, but as the game progresses, that humor begins to fade away. Perhaps because the story takes a darker turn, but ya know what, people tend to be funnier in the ghetto than on Wall Street. Who decided that the seedier parts of town should be devoid of comedy? Those are the people that need it most.      There are some decent RPG elements thrown in the towns. Weapons and armor can be upgraded at the blacksmith, with each weapon and armor having different numbers of slots available. You can slot in an upgrade to boost your attack power, chance of getting a critical hit, or even a drain that heals the character 10% of the total damage. Money is pretty easy to come by after about the halfway point in the adventure, so you'll have no real troubles slotting in various upgrades. As for leveling up, it happens pretty regularly and you'll have a pretty good option for upgrading characters to make them powerful in the areas you find most important.  All of that upgrading and micromanagement -- a staple of RPGs and fairly painless in Sudeki (hooray) --  is necessary to survive some truly titanic battles. I will warn that combat is a little sluggish through the first five or six hours of Sudeki, but as you reach the second world (of three), with all four characters fighting together for the first time, things really begin to kick ass. You have two shooters in the group (Ailish and Elco) and two hand-to-hand combatants (Tal and Buki). The shooters are literally shooting all the time. When you switch to them (and you can quickly switch to control any character in combat with the White and Black buttons), you go into a first-person shooting mode. Each has a variety of weapons (Ailish staves, Elco pistols) with different properties and fire rates. It can be fun to do some shooting for a bit, but the true beauty of this outstanding combat system can be found when you take control of Tal or Buki.  When controlling the two warriors, you'll be in a third-person perspective with a very manageable camera -- which has problems getting stuck behind walls and objects once or twice in a blue moon. Controls are simple, with X and A serving as the two attack buttons. Combos consist of three button presses, with timing and the combination of buttons determining if you successfully nail the combo or not (a combo meter in the bottom left of the screens helps quite a bit). Even if you fail to hit a combo, you'll still offer up three attacks, you just won't earn a cool extra bonus from the full combo. Once I got the hang of the combo system, it became a snap to get Tal to do a Matrix-like 360 kick with his blade planted in the ground or to get Buki to unleash a fury of claw swipes. Combat is damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn fun.    I often find myself disliking combat in RPGs and preferring the story elements. Sudeki is the opposite. Were this instead a dungeon-crawler like Baldur's Gate it may well be the best dungeon-crawler of all time. The combat becomes that much fun. Especially with all four characters on screen facing literally dozens of enemies that just keep coming and coming. Sometimes battles can last upwards of 20 minutes -- even longer at times. But it doesn't get tiresome or tedious, instead it just gets better and better as the game goes on. Rather than dreading an encounter, I actually found myself looking forward to random battles. I wish they happened more often, that the game was structured differently to focus on the very best Sudeki has to offer, instead of splitting so much time between its strongest and weakest points.  The score, which is very effective, kicks into overdrive in combat. While not as sweeping or majestic as some Square RPGs, the score fits the environments and world perfectly. Like the combat, I never got tired of the music, which has enough variety and certainly enough quality to sustain the length of the adventure.  Of course, no fantasy RPG would be complete without magic and Sudeki allows all four characters to cast magic, or rather to use Skill Strikes. Each character has a half-dozen unique Skill Strikes that must be purchased when leveling up. After hitting Y to slow time and bring up the combat menu, select the Skill Strike desired, you'll then have a few seconds to line up your shot (some Strikes have a line attack, some are conical, some are radial) before a cut-scene shows off the casting, with characters offering a few different random phrases each time a Skill Strike spell is spun. The strikes are colorful, powerful, and overall well-orchestrated.       On top of Skill Strikes, over the course of the adventure, each character earns two unique Spirit Strikes. To use these, you must first fill up your Spirit Strike Meter, which increases with each successful attack made on an enemy. The Spirit Strikes tend to either be defensive or offensive. The defensive ones aren't that attractive, but can help when you're overwhelmed in battle. They also tend to only cost 100 Spirit Strike Points as opposed to the 200 SSP required for most of the smart bomb-like offensive strikes. Yes, offensive Spirit Strikes generally kill everything on screen at once. It's a great sensation seeing all those enemies implode at the same moment (with blood spurting in all directions), but since SSP is relatively easy to gain, this cheapens combat a bit. It's far more entertaining to kick the crap out of all the enemies with Tal or Buki than use a single spell to take them all down in one shot.  Throughout this hectic combat, the framerate is generally held in check. The game does offer some framerate drops, sometimes when a large number of enemies go splat at once, but more often in the non-combat areas, where the use of self-shadowing (which isn't really necessary) can sometimes bog down the game. It's not too bad, doesn't come up too often, but there are a few specific spots where slowdown always hits. No biggie, but it is there. Fortunately, this doesn't hinder combat, and that's what really matters anyway.  The final element, the one where Sudeki really fails (the story isn't bad, it just doesn't do anything great) is whenever a ~puzzle~ is introduced. I put ~puzzle~ in quotes, because most of these don't really qualify as puzzles. Each character has one special ability for use outside of combat. Ailish can cast dispel to make invisible items appear or to remove invisible barriers, Tal can push and pull specific blocks, Elco has a jetpack, which can be used whenever he is near gold crystals, Buki can climb moss-covered walls and chain link. The problem is that all of these abilities are used in incredibly obvious circumstances.   When you are at a spot where Elco must use his jetpack, it's pretty obvious because, well, there's a gap and a gold crystal nearby. Since Elco can't gain elevation (kind of a crappy jetpack if you ask me), he will just be moving across gaps. That's all he ever does. It's readily apparent. There is no ~puzzle~ to it, no difficulty whatsoever. It's also clear where and when Buki can climb (text appears along with an A Button icon, in case you are too dumb to figure out what constitutes moss on a wall). And Tal, well, he moves big blocks with handles on every end. He has two true puzzles, which come later on in Sudeki, which aren't so bad actually, but the rest of the time his block-moving is just an exercise to make the game last a little longer.     Ailish is perhaps the most wasted of all the talents. Invisible items, walls, bridges, and switches conveniently glow with gold fairy dust. You really can't miss any of them. Once she spots some fairy dust (which any character can see, actually), you must go into first-person perspective, look at the dust, and hit A to dispel (once again text appears for the Forrest Gumps in the audience). Why not instead only show the fairy dust if you first look in that direction with Ailiash in first-person view? While this would mean that players would have to walk around with Ailish a lot searching out hidden items, to me that seems at least challenging and a bit more of a ~do it if you really wanna to find secrets,~ type deal than the ~look, look, we hid something right here... no, right here. Look, it's so obvious. Let's tell you to hit A in case you don't get it.~   There are a lot of other strange (feel free to read that as ~bad~) design choices in Sudeki. Buki is a member of an anthropomorphic tribe. The majority of whose members are actually more animal than human. So why did Climax decide that the ani-morph to join your group would basically be human with some stripes? I'd much rather play with a cool tigress woman than some chic that could double as Ailish's sister.   There's also a clever D-Pad setup for items, where you can assign any item to a D-Pad direction so that hitting that D-Pad uses that item rather than forcing you to go through the item menu. Problem is, there is such an incredibly wide and unnecessary amount of healing items that you run out of one quickly and must assign another in-stock healing potion to the D-Pad. It becomes more work than simply going to the item menu each time. While it appears at first glance that Sudeki is filled with different items, closer inspection shows that most of it is just a ridiculously large variety of healing options.        My least favorite decision was the one that always places a single character up against a boss. While there are one or two mini-boss fights with all four characters, the big bosses must be fought solo. Why the hell am I playing with four characters if I can never have them tackle a baddie all at once? Certainly the last boss should be handled by all four. But no, the final boss must be handled one-on-one.  Once you beat the final boss the game ends. I mean, it literally ends as soon as the last boss is iced. Kill him and you get a quick death cut-scene followed by a replay of the intro sequence, and then the credits roll. I can't get into why this is so disconcerting without revealing the plot, but I will say that there are major events that are said to happen the moment you kill the final villain. You don't get to see the aftermath, no flyby of the world you just played in to see how the NPCs turned out, no denouement showing the heroes embracing a brand new day.   I do have to say that while Climax made some missteps, perhaps attributable to the RPG rookie status of the developer, they did a very nice job of avoiding the fantasy trap that many RPGs fall into. Though this is a fantasy universe, Sudeki is its own universe. It doesn't borrow from D&D or other classic fantasy types. While I do wish the world and characters were more fleshed out, they are pretty unique. Sudeki has its own vibe. Whether you find that vibe captivating or not likely depends on personal taste. For me, the size and breadth of all three worlds fails to match the magnitude of the story being told.    The environments show off a nice range for the world. The variance between sunny, vibrant locations and dark, muddled areas works perfectly for the story. The environments -- with detailed trees and foliage, patchwork houses, and fantastic lighting -- are the strong point visually. The character design isn't the best out there. One of the main NPCs, Lord Talos, looks like a mish-mash of different RPG characters from the past 20 years. He looks absolutely ridiculous, not menacing as he is meant to be. The costume changes (which occur as characters upgrade armor) a noticeable and offer a lot of variation for each of the four characters throughout the game. Tal isn't a little kid adventurer and while his buxom female companions look a bit too similar in many respects, neither is annoying. I'm not a fan of the faces, which seem a purposeful cross between realism and anime -- but then I still get freaked out by The Dark Crystal. I love RPGs and am a big fan of traditional roleplaying games. Chrono Trigger, any Final Fantasy game, Golden Sun -- these are games that feature a lot of combat, a lot of story, puzzle elements, and good endings. They aren't secret games people don't know about. If you're gonna make an RPG, these are the type of games you play, that you learn from. Sudeki isn't among the elite RPGs. It isn't Baldur's Gate, either, because there's far too little combat mixed with a lot of very slow-paced story elements that don't really go far enough. If you are an RPG fan, get this game anyway. Why? Because you need something to tide you over until the fall, when several more RPGs arrive. You'll play Sudeki to its conclusion (which took me only 17 hours, with no reason to play again) and you'll probably like (but not love) it. It's a snack before the feast.Sudeki is good, but it's not great, and with big guns like KOTOR II, Fable, Jade Empire on the way, this is one RPG that will likely be forgotten before the year is over. Still, there aren't many Xbox games to play this summer. Get it now and you'll have it beaten well before the arrival of Fable in September.", "date": "Jul 21, 2004"}
