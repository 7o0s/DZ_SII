This racer stars not real-world racers, but rather the popular line of RC cars that fly of toy store shelves year-round.  Features: Three tracks Three real DuraTrax cars Three difficulty levels  And just how does DuraTrax Mobile RC manage to avoid spinning out like other racers?  By swinging the action to above, which lessens the impact of the -- again -- lack of speed that plagues handset racers.  You're looking down on the track from an isometric angle, guiding your itty-bitty RC car around the three provided tracks.  It's too bad the screen is so small, because DuraTrax Mobile RC would have seriously benefitted from seeing more of the track.  It makes planning turns harder until you memorize the entire course.  As it it is, the courses are small enough to commit to memory, but with PIN number, telephone numbers, favorite Spice Girl, and so many other things to stuff up your mind, do you really have room for the twisty-turns of DuraTrax Mobile RC?  Sorrent licensed three cars from DuraTrax: the Evader BX, which has a good top speed, the Evader ST with top acceleration, and the massive Thunder Quake with the best handling and weight of the bunch.  And unlike so many other racers, these cars actually do handle differently, so depending on which track you pick, it pays to devote some attention to car choice.  The zippy BX is good for the straight stretches on the easy track, but you might want to consider the ST so you can get right back up to speed after navigating the tougher turns of the other two courses.  The track is crowded with other RC cars that you must avoid, lest you want to do damage to your car or slow yourself down.  There are almost track hazards, like oil slicks, that you must also watch out for.  Should your vehicle take damage, keep an eye out for tiny wrenches that will increase the piece.  If you find yourself to be a more aggressive racer that enjoys playing crash n' bash, then just go with the Thunder Quake and hope for the best.  DuraTrax Mobile RC offer two control schemes: regular and directional.  Regular is as if you were actually inside the cab of your RC, while directional is controlling it from the outside.  You actually push the control pad in the direction of the turn, rather than trying to steer.  Most racers will likely want to go with directional.  Sorrent didn't apply the same visual polish to DuraTrax Mobile RC that they did to their FOX Sports Basketball game, which is too bad.  The fun doesn't suffer because of this by any stretch, but we all know by now what these first-gen phones can do when a develop put their mind to it.  The RC cars look like RC cars, but the tracks are rather dull to look at.  And too bad the whine of the RC engine is nowhere to be found in the version we played on a Motorola T720. DuraTrax manages to succeed where other racers have failed--it's fun.  By stepping outside the conventions of a typical racer and going to toy RC route, they circumvent the problems that plagued other racers.  Sorrent is also being smart about its licenses: FOX Sports, DuraTrax.  This is going to be a company to watch in the future as handset gaming matures, trust me.", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
