Next, ~Pirates of the Caribbean~ soared. So who knew what to expect from Disney's third theme park ride-based film, ~Disney's Haunted Mansion.~ A modest double, apparently. The film never quite connected with audiences, but that didn't stop TDK from releasing an underappreciated console game based on the flick, and now Disney Interactive is testing the mobile arena with a go-go take on the haunted abode.  Features:  Based on the Disney film Multiple rooms to solve Does not star Eddie Murphy  We mentioned that last part for the two or three Eddie Murphy left above the age of ten. Eddie does not lend his likeness to the game whatsoever. Rather, you are a mild-mannered housekeeper that must try to clear the Haunted Mansion of creepy ghosts and all other undead nastiness.  Haunted Mansion is more of a puzzle game than an actioner. You must complete a series of rooms by dispersing ghosts with your flashlight, sealing off ghost generators, and turning the lights on before moving on to the next area. Is it simple? Yes. Does it work? Actually, it works better than the movie it's based on. In fact, the game will kinda remind you of a portable Luigi's Mansion, and if you dug that initial GameCube offering, you'll likely enjoy this little romp, too.  Clearing a room is a several step affair. First, you must eliminate the initial batch of ghosties by blasting them with your flashlight beam. Once they've been taken care of, you must search the paintings on the wall. Some of them serve as ghost ~generators~ that keep the room fully stocked with errant spirits. Seal these hot spots with your flashlight. If you don't seal these, new ghosts will lurch out of the walls and attempt to turn the lights off. You see, you can only unlock the door and move to the next room if the lights are on. Got it? Well, get ghostbustin' then already.  There are items strewn about the house to help out. the most helpful is the flash camera. Apparently, the ghosts are afraid of the flash. One blast from the Instamatic will clear out an entire area.  For a game based in a dark house, it doesn't look too shabby. For once, drab, muted colors are appropriate. The ghosts pretty much all look the same and rooms reuse a lot of the same dcor, but them's the breaks in a mobile game, we suppose. There is a decent amount of audio, too. Don't tell Matt over at Cube, but I thought TDK's Haunted Mansion was terribly underrated. It was a fun, competent platformer that suffered from being attached to a unsuccessful film. Hopefully, this mobile game won't suffer the same fate, as it's a decent little download that will keep you entertained for a while. It's easy to blow ten or fifteen minutes clearing out the mansion. And from a simple game like this, what more could you ask for?", "date": "Jan 22, 2004"}
