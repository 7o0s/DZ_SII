Glu Mobile and its FOX Sports franchise bowed out of the arena. THQ Wireless still published an NFL sim last year, but it was no match for EA Mobile's pigskin contest. Would mobile publishers cede the football category to EA? Or could some brave developer rise up and throw a Hail Mary over Madden's head.   Gameloft answers that question with Reggie Bush Pro Football 2007, the best 2D mobile football on handsets today. Now, that mantle isn't hard to assume. Unlike the solidly entertaining 3D Madden 07, last year's 2D edition of Madden was downright pathetic. Really the only thing it had going for it was the full NFL license and the fact that it would indeed start up when you wanted to open it for the first (and likely final) time.   Reggie Bush Pro Football 2007 lacks the NFL license, but it does a solid job recreating the general feel of the league. All of the official cities are present and accounted for, but their teams just have different names and uniform colors so as not to suffer litigation. The only licensed player in the game Reggie Bush, the cover athlete.   Two things matter most in mobile football: The ease of moving the ball up and down the field and the fairness of computer-controlled opponents. Gameloft gets both of these reasonably right. Control works because, well, it's using methodology perfected by JAMDAT's final footballer before the EA Mobile buyout. Passing is assigned to the bottom keys (*, 0, #), for example, and as the offensive play unfolds, the icons change color depending on the openness of the receiver. When you see red, don't even try it. You will not complete that pass because the AI doesn't make stupid mistakes.   The playbook is easily navigated, with clean-looking plays and a useful coach option that recommends options when you're not sure of the best course of action. One thing that I really appreciated was that before the actual play starts on the field, you see the movement lines from the playbook. This gives you a real-world idea of how the play is about to unfold. Actually tracing the path of receivers is something no future footballer should be without.   Defense is always harder to run than offense, but Reggie Bush does a good job making it as painless as possible. Against the computer, you better expect to see a few runners sneak through the AI will exploit your weak spots. But watch how it's done so you can figure out the empty lanes when it's your turn with the ball.   Before hitting the field for a full sixteen-game season, consider using the training mode to practice stiff arms and passing. Once you have the basics down, head into an exhibition game for a one-off challenge.   Because this is a Gameloft game, fell comfortable knowing that you're in for great production values. When a game starts, you get an opening animation of your team exploding out of a giant football helmet. The tiny players are decently detailed for a 2D football game. More than just good graphics, Gameloft doesn't disappoint stat fans. Reggie Bush keeps track of running yards, passes, TDs, and every other number imaginable.   From its hip-hop soundtrack to great playbook, Gameloft's Reggie Bush Pro Football establishes itself as a contender in its rookie year. I know this game can look even better (I played it on a Sony Ericsson w810i) and control a little tighter, but for a first effort, Gameloft should be commended. If you don't have a high-end handset that powers Madden 07 3D, Reggie Bush is far superior to your other 2D options.", "date": "Feb 27, 2007"}
