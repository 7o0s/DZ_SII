Both Suikoden and Vandal Hearts were excellent titles, and while Azure Dreams doesn't entirely measure up, it is still a decent RPG in its own right.  The story of Azure Dreams unfolds in the desert town of Monsbaiya, where an ancient tower exists. After generations of peace, it seems that the tower has once again become overrun with an evil force. Curious and somewhat scared, the villagers decide that they should send a brave person into it to see why the evil has awakened. Unfortunately, that brave person ends up being your father, Guy. After several days have passed, there is still no word from your father, but his monster familiar returns. Fearing for your father's life, you decide to enter the tower, yourself, and find him.  Graphically, this game is adequate but not quite as visually appealing as most players would hope or expect. Characters and monsters tend to look quite a bit pixely, as do the game's rather simplistic polygonal environments. After a while, you get used to it but most gamers won't want to after seeing the visuals in such games as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics.  Fortunately, while the game is a bit lacking in the graphics department, it does feature some rather innovative elements for the RPG genre. Much like in Tecmo's Monster Rancher, players can raise and ~breed~ monster familiars. These familiars will become part of your party and fight along side you in the Tower. They will also give you valuable advice during the game. You can even adjust certain aspects of your monster such as its fighting position in a battle. The other innovative feature is the way that the actual Tower is designed. Basically, all the levels are randomly generated and then populated with monsters and traps. Every time you enter the Tower, it is completely different. This randomness allows for far more replay value than most other RPGs.  The actual fighting, in the game, is still turn-based, but Konami has added in a hint of real-time combat. You can freely move around during battles, but turn your back to an opponent and they will normally get in a free hit. As usual spells can also be acquired and used along with what ever weapons and items you find laying around in the tower.  In most cases, Azure Dreams is a very standard RPG but it does have just enough new elements to warrant a look. If you are a hard-core fan of the genre, or are just looking for something a little bit different than give this game a try. You might be thoroughly surprised.  Steven Frost", "date": "Aug 25, 1998"}
