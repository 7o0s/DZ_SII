That doesn't mean that this game from Activision is bad by any means; sure, it doesn't have a whole lot of variety and it's over uncomfortably quick, but it's a fun romp while it lasts. Features Nine levels Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Iron Man's really just some dude in a really powerful suit, and in this Game Boy Advance game his suit has been stolen...probably due to some unforeseen dry-cleaning incident or something. Luckily, he's got a spare, and now it's off through hazard-infested areas to find out who took the suit and why.  The direction that Torus Games isn't exactly surprising, since Iron Man really does look like the type that would fit in a Mega Man style action-platform. The actual design of The Invincible Iron Man is pretty decent as well, with a healthy balance between platform jumping and gun-blasting action. It really does feel like a Mega Man action game, especially with the inability to fire in any upward direction.  But unlike a Mega Man game, Invincible Iron Man lacks a certain variety in its gameplay. It's good fun for what it is, but there's no discovery; there's no extra weaponry and no special abilities beyond what he has at the beginning of the game. This really limits the designers in what they can do in each of the nine different levels. Each level's challenging in its own right, but beyond the new graphics for each of the areas, there's nothing vastly different to see in each location. Every level features a series of platforms to traverse, the same power-up icons to collect, and the same half-dozen different enemies to blast. To extend the gameplay, there's a little bit of collection involved, but the payoff (a set of eight still screens of art) isn't really much to get excited about.  But even though it's clear that this game was a ~B~ title for the Game Boy Advance, what with its slightly limited gameplay and only nine levels in its queue, Torus made the best of what the team was given. The artwork is outstanding, with excellent, fluid pixel animation for the Iron Man sprite and the different enemies throughout the game, as well as a decent sidescrolling engine that features a huge amount of scrolling layers and several on-screen sprites with zero slowdown. The game's a little too short, and there's not much else to discover gameplay-wise beyond what the first level offers, but for what it is Invincible Iron Man isn't too shabby. The art and animation is the real charm here, with shooting action -- as simplistic as it is -- that's pretty satisfying.", "date": "Jan 22, 2003"}
