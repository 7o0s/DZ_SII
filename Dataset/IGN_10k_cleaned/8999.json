It was a decade of miracles, and we can't forget the music that came with it. But what will you do if VH1 isn't running some kind of compilation show? How can you relive the glory days?  Why not crank up your PlayStation 2?   That's right, next week Sony's bringing you SingStar '80s, a collection of 30 songs and music videos from the decade of decadence as well as six medleys for you to croon along with.   What's that? You don't know what SingStar is? Egad, man -- it's Sony's answer to what a karaoke videogame should be. You pick a song from the likes of Billy Joel, Men At Work and Tina Turner, pick up one of the SingStar microphones -- which can come bundled with the game for $50 -- and croon along with the words as they illuminate on screen. To do well, you'll need to fill in these blank bars on screen with your player color.   How do you fill them in? By singing perfectly.     If your pitch is too high, you'll paint the area above the bars. If your pitch is too low, you'll paint the areas below the bars. When you get to the end of the on-screen lyrics, the game gives you a written critique such as ~cool~ or ~awful~ and scores the performance before adding it to your ever accumulating overall score.   Those are the basics that have been with the franchise for years. We'll get into some more mode detail in a second, but let's talk about what makes this game different from the rest of the SingStar pack -- song selection.   '80s, Baby!

I don't even think I have to go into the details, do I? Music from the '80s rocks, and there are few sights these weary eyes have seen that can match the jaw-dropping performance of the IGN Insider Team as David Clayman went about a dozen octaves out of his range for ~Uptown Girl~ and Nate Ahearn bopped his head while rocking a pink wig for ~Material Girl.~   And therein lies the rub. Your enjoyment of SingStar '80s comes down to how many goofy friends you have that are cool with making fools out of themselves. Earlier this week, we hosted an IGN SingStar Showdown -- a double-elimination tournament to crown the best crooner in the office. Thirteen editors and one visiting fiance showed up to go off on Twisted Sister and remember the days when Madness was popular.   The battle was fierce, the talent was minimal, and pizza was free.   Our two-hour competition relied on Battle -- one of the Party modes that had two players singing the same song at the same time for the best score -- but if we weren't blood-thirsty gladiators, we could have busted out some Duets or divided into two teams for Pass the Mic, where up to eight players toss the mics around while trying to succeed in a set of seven challenges such as being the first to rake in 5,000 points and best each other in overall medley scores.      So, there's a wealth of multiplayer options for you to go to town on with friends, but if you're more of a solo artist and prefer to rock out alone, you're screwed. Single-player leaves you with two options: sing solo and try to best the high scores across the three difficulties, or head into Freestyle and sing without any pitch/timing indicators or score.    It's the biggest chink in SingStar's armor, but I have trouble faulting Sony for it. The company has always promoted the game in videos and in conversation as a multiplayer experience. They want this to be a game you get your friends around to play, and on that level, it succeeds. However, the lack of anything unlockable or any kind of career mode stunts the true potential of this franchise. Although, I love to look like an idiot in front of friends; maybe I could get better at the songs I'm butchering if I played by myself, but for that to happen, I need to be working towards something. I don't want to be playing and practicing for nothing.   That's a shame because practice literally makes perfect in this game.     If you don't know the melody and lyrics of these songs, you're done. SingStar wants you to sing these songs just like they were performed in their music videos -- you can't adjust for your personal range -- and that means folks tend to avoid the songs they don't know all that well.   See if you can follow this flow chart: Bobby only knows 11 songs on '80s - Bobby sings those songs every time he plays - Bobby starts to get sick of those songs but doesn't want to try something new because he'll lose - Bobby gets bored and stops playing '80s.   Sound crazy? It's not. During our tournament, we were only a round or so in when people started asking to sing songs others had already performed. Basically, SingStar's focus on multiplayer is a catch-22. People want to win, they stick to what they know, and the move drastically cuts down the number of songs people are going to want to sing on the disc. If the game had a single-player mode that forced singers to branch out, the song library would open up to everyone either by experience or watching a seasoned vet play.  Daemon and Charles live for this. Am I being too hard on SingStar? Nah, I'm just getting caught up in some of my gripes. This's a great time that anyone can jump into and those who are dedicated to sticking around can master. Add in an EyeToy and the party only gets better as you watch the performances on screen with the option to add effects and wait for a Golden Moment -- an EyeToy logo pops up on some of the timing bars and the device records a few seconds of you belting out the tune sans the backup music that you can then watch when all is said and done.   When your rockfest is done, your score is broken down by the number of notes you nailed, and if you score well enough, you're added to the ranked list along with an optional EyeToy photo. SingStar is out to be a fun and engaging multiplayer karaoke game, and it succeeds at that. If you're in the mood to scream the lyrics of a Duran Duran classic or try to keep up with Nema, this is the title for you -- everything that's in this game is available for you and your friends as soon as you unwrap the plastic. However, if you're looking for something that will keep you playing when your friends head home, this iteration of SingStar might not have the shelf life you're looking for -- unless besting your own high scores is where it's at for you.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
