Nothing's worse than buying a Game Boy Color game that's just a one-trick pony that'll end up in the Bin of Unplayed Cartridges after a few minutes of play. Gobs of Games is 3DO's attempt to add a whole grab-bag of things to do on one title, but most of the games in this crammed cartridge are games that can easily be played with a pen and paper. To expect folks shell out 30 bucks per player is a little absurd, despite the fact that the games themselves are relatively fun to play.FeaturesSixteen different gamesLink cable support for two playersOnly for Game Boy ColorGobs of Games would be worth purchasing on the low-end price scale of Game Boy Color games -- at most, 20 bucks, because you've played all these games before in physical form. As a Game Boy Color title, you just don't have to worry about wasting paper or carting around pegs.The games in Gobs of Games include:Peg Boards. You've probably played these things while waiting for your ice cream at the local diner -- you've got a bunch of holes, and pegs in all but one of the holes. The idea is to remove all but one of the pegs off the board by ~Checker-Jumping~ -- you can only move pegs by leaping to a secondary hole over one peg. When you leap over a peg, the peg you've leapt over gets taken off the board. A lot of thought is needed to figure out how to remove all the pegs off the board.Paper Games. Take turns with your opponent by connecting dots with vertical or horizontal lines. In Dot Boxes, you draw lines until you can form a square, which gives you an extra turn. End up with the most boxes and win. Dot Triangles, just change ~square~ to ~triangle~. Snake is all about taking turns drawing a continuous line until you can't keep it going (it butts up against the edge or itself, for example). In Colored Snake,  you draw your own lines to make a chain from one side to another, with your opponent doing the same. Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe need no explanation.Puzzle Games There are two here: Scramble, the old tile-shuffling game (the game that the Pokmon of the Day guy absolutely hates, and ends up in half the Game Boy Color games out there), and Move It, a take on the crate-moving puzzle game where you have to move boxes through a maze to a set destination -- if you get stuck against a wall or corner, you're screwed.Board Games Obviously there were plans for more than one game here, but all that ended up in the menu option was Checkers.Most of the games have link-cable support for two players, and the overall design on these games is simplistic to make the package inviting for the younger player. But for two player games, you need two copies of Gobs of Games, two Game Boy Color systems, and a link cable, when all you really need is a piece of paper and a pen for 90% of these games. I'm all for link-cable support, but all of these games could have hot-potatoed one system for two players.The only true upside I can find on Gobs of Games is the fact that the Checkers and Paper Games can be played with a computer opponent -- which is handy since you don't need to find a friend to play 'em. But 30 bucks is a bit on the high side for a package of games that 's made to play in a notebook.", "date": "Oct 11, 2000"}
