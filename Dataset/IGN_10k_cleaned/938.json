This addicting action game really pushed the system to its limits, which made me wonder how the heck Crawfish planned on bringing the title to the Game Boy Color. Well, the portable version is out, and I have to say...smashing good job, gang. Features Three cities: Miami, LA, and New York More than thirty missions Mini-games like Getaway and Survival Password save Only for Game Boy Color   The PlayStation's 3D design put together by Reflections (of Destruction Derby fame) has been reduced to a top-down driver for the Game Boy Color. But you know what? It still works extremely well. At this overhead perspective you get to see a lot more of what's going on around you. I do miss the crazy physics of  the jumps and spins in the original game, and wish they could've been portrayed here on the weaker hardware, but as an abridged version of a maniacal mission racer, Driver on the Game Boy Color turned out extremely well.  Like the original game, you're an undercover cop gone mob driver. Your task is to run jobs, whatever the gang tells you to do -- hey, you have to play the role.  Some missions range from simply driving from one place to another. Others put you in the pursuit of an enemy vehicle and you'll have to ram him to disable him. In one specifically cool job, you have to plow your vehicle into the doorway of five restaurants before the cops catch you. Whatever the mission, you need to keep your eyes on four important things: the damage meter, the felony meter, the mission clock, and, probably most important of all, the map of the city. The damage meter tells you when your car's had enough -- fill it up, and it's game over. The felony meter goes up when you commit a specific crime in front of a cop car -- bump into traffic or pick up your getaway gang in sight of a cop, and he's going to come after you.   But regardless of what mission you're running, if you don't follow the map, you'll never complete your task. You need to know the ins and outs of the pathways between point-A and point-B, and if you just drive blindly you'll never ever get to your destination. An arrow is always hovering around your car telling you where the next point is, but it's only an ~as the crow flies~ direction -- you still need to take the proper path. If you suddenly drive into a dead-ended alleyway, you've just cut into your precious time. Many missions have portions that need to be accomplished in a set amount of seconds. Screw up the path you're supposed to take, and it's all over.  The car handling is superb -- take a sharp turn and your vehicle sends off a streaking line of tire smoke. And since you'll have your hands behind the wheel of other cars, like a cop vehicle or a stretch limo, each has its own feel. And the graphic detail...hey, these may be lines for cars, but you can easily tell what's going on. That black and white line is a cop -- and if there's flashing red and blue around him, you better step on it. And there's enough gameplay options to keep you going for a while -- the developers even put in the cool Survival Mode where you see how long you can last against kamikaze cops.  There are many aspects of Driver that I miss from the PlayStation counterpart -- there's no training mode at the beginning of the game. You're simply hired and plopped into your first mission. I guess this is because the realistic vehicle physics have been watered down, so there's no real reason to learn slalom driving or a 360 spin -- these moves just aren't in the game. Still, that test was a great challenge, and added a bit of variety to the game. And where the heck are the hills? All the cities are completely flat -- there's no real reason why hills couldn't have been portrayed in this overhead perspective, and if they would have been, it would have added a bit more to the gameplay because of the wild jumps that would be possible. And one more complaint -- no link cable mode. I know, the original game didn't have any two player options -- but that doesn't mean that Crawfish couldn't have taken the initiative and build one into the game. I would have loved to go up against a friend in a cops-and-robbers chase through LA, Miami, and New York.  I'm actually quite surprised at how well Driver turned out for the Game Boy Color. I was expecting a Point-A-to-B game like Grand Theft Auto and got a whole lot more. The missions have different elements to give the basic formula a bit more variety. It's missing a few details from the PlayStation version, but for what Crawfish had to work with hardware-wise, the development team did a great job.", "date": "May 16, 2000"}
