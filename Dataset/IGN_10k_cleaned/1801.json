They probably don't know they're my friend, but they are.  So when I need to get in touch with all my peeps and gal pals, I need something digital to remind me of what their phone number is, where they live, what their e-mail address is, what their names are...Also, I get a little flustered in the day and forget a lot of stuff. For example, over the last two months, I've plumb forgotten to update the Pokmon of the Day -- whoda' thunk! Boy, I gotta' my act together, and what better way than with the help of Ahsley and MK!Features:Get organized with the hyper-cute Olsen Twins!!! Calendar, Stop Watch, Phone Book, fun games, and much, much more!!! Send secret messages to your friends with the Infrared Port!!! Print out pictures of Mary-Kate and Ashley with the Game Boy Printer!!! For Game Boy and Game Boy Color!! Mary-Kate and Ashley's Pocket Planner is a little blessing from the girls -- a handheld organizer for the Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Color. It's not the most inclusive organizer you could hope for (my life is just too hard for a Game Boy game!), but what it's missing in features, it makes up for in cuteness! Mary-Kate and Ashley are on every screen of the game, and that's not a problem for me, let me tell you. Those are some fun-loving twins, and MK&A Pocket Planner shows you how much fun spending every day with the MK&A can be.How much fun? Well, how cool would it be to have a Crush-O-Meter device, so that if you have the hots for a hottie, you can just point the device at that person (even when they're not looking) and find out whether or not they might be crushing back for you? Or a special thingy that send secret messages to friends in class, so instead of sending paper notes, you send G-Mail (that's E-Mail for girls)? That's what this game does! There's all kinds of cute stuff like that that's just perfect for girls, and young boys might learn a thing or two as well.The game has a simple input system that leads you through the whole process of putting in your vitals. Everything from your name and phone number to the names of your pets to your favorite actor and actress to your LEAST favorite food, is in there -- it even asks who your dream date would be! How rude! Well, how rude, until the game lets you choose a secret password that keeps any info you put in totally a complete secret from any prying snoops! That's cool -- I trust my Mary-Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner with all my private dish, because it won't tell a soul!Plus, there's bunches of pictures and fun facts of Mary-Kate and Ashley. Like, did you know that Mary-Kate's pony is named CD? Me neither! The pictures aren't so good quality, since the game's made to work with the Game Boy Pocket as well as the GBC, but the Olsens are cute enough to look their best even in bad pictures. (Plus, you can print any picture with the Game Boy Printer!) The girls show up in all the games -- that's Ashley dressed up as a fakir in the Crystal Ball Fortune Teller feature. Their dog Clue is your virtual pet (just like a Tamagotchi Love Egg!).OK, OK, OK... Not everything's great with the game. It's a good pocket organizer when its on, but it can't beep an alarm or give you a reminder when it's off like a real pocket organizer would. Also, the Calendar isn't as much fun as it should be -- it doesn't do anything special like play special Christmas music or sing you Happy Birthday for special events. It does give you some awesome bonus points on your birthday [which earn you special picts of MK&A in different fash outfits], but there should be more cool stuff on special days, like maybe a pot of gold substituted for every icon on Saint Patty's Day. I didn't even know it was Valentine's Day today until I checked my calendar, even though I used my MK&A Pocket Planner all day long. Then there's this super-awesome Match-Up Mode where you compare yourself to your friends to see how compatible you two are as best friends, but it doesn't save the info to your list of friends. Why come this doesn't do something like that? Oh, and even though I don't care about some of the bad graphics because it's MK&A, the end animation for the Shop Til You Drop mini-game is gross! What's up with Ashley's dress being all short and ugly and riding up too far -- she's not a wrestler Nitro Girl, people!Comments Now, I realize that some of you might not be as great big Olsen twin fans as I am, even the some of you that are 14 year old girls and would like a fun Mary-Kate doll or an Ashley sing-a-long tape. Heck, I'm their #1 fan!But Mary-Kate and Ashley's Pocket Planner is still a lot of fun-spirited fun, whether you're an Olsen fan or not.  It helps to be a fan, obviously, but most any girl would love the kind of stuff that's in here. The little stuff, the stuff that has the least to do with the Olsen Twins, is the most fun -- where else will you find a tool that'll remind you which Zodiac signs you'd be most compatible with for potential friends and dates? If there's a sequel someday, I'm hoping that they do a lot more with the Virtual Clue feature (he eats and goes to sleep -- what a boring dog), and maybe if they could do an actual Diary in there instead of just a few quick notes here and there, MK&A Pocket Planner would rule! But that doesn't mean that this MK&A Pocket Planner doesn't rule -- I just wish it will rule more next time! Now, what's on the schedule for tomorrow, Mary-Kate? --Pokmon Of The Day Guy", "date": "Feb 21, 2001"}
