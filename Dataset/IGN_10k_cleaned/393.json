But don't imagine that the company is completely inexperienced in this field. Some members of the Nations team are veterans of flight sim design at other companies. Craig Penrice, former RAF squadron leader and senior test pilot for the Eurofighter, is the technical consultant on Nations. He's flown quite a few of these aircraft himself and knows their performance characteristics well enough to advise Psygnosis on the matter. Nations successfully walks the line between hardcore realism and relaxed accessibility. Unfortunately, there aren't enough missions to keep the interest level high in the long run. But it does offer the classic WWII dogfight action that you crave. Modern sims crap out when it comes to face to face contact with the enemy. The limitations of WWII aviation make close combat a necessity.  The manual offers a really great overview of the European airwar in terms of both history and tactics. I found the history section quite informative and it really helped me get into the game. Plus there are numerous vignettes of vintage WWII footage linking together the missions. A brief analysis of the war effort is included with these vignettes to add layers of context. I found the tactics section of the manual to be a little brief, but it does serve well as an introduction to the topic. Another resource in the game is the WWII plane database. You can come here to check out performance characteristics and photos of all the aircraft in the game. But what am I talking about? You want to know how the game plays.  Nations offers a ~completely accurate~ physics model. Since that seems to be a phrase thrown about these days, let's talk about what that means. Four main forces affect each plane in real life. Lift is the upward force of the aircraft. The force of gravity counteracts it. Thrust governs the aircraft's forward momentum. The opposite of thrust is the drag created by air resistance. Beyond these four forces, each aircraft operates along six axes. No, not those things that you chop down trees with, the things around which you may pivot. Pitch is created as the nose of your aircraft points up or down. Yaw is the same motion when oriented side-to-side. The final axis is roll, governed by the motion of the wingtips relative to the horizon. Make sense? Good. That's the way that Nations simulates flight.  If you don't want to worry about all these forces, you can tone down the realism a little bit. The lowest realism setting reduces some of the side slip motion and attack angle stalls as well as giving your plane a little extra engine power. To be honest, I found the Relaxed Realism setting more difficult to handle than the higher levels. The engine isn't limited to rendering flight models in terms of absolutes either. You will find that performance on your aircraft will decrease in many interesting ways as you take damage. There are 12 different aircraft systems that can be affected by damage, and damage to each of those systems will result in decreased or irregular performance.   I found that the game simulated flight pretty well. As said before, it's a compromise between fun and factual flight. And it succeeds at keeping the balance smooth. There are some minor issues with the lack of rudder response, but like I said, they're minor. The other flight controls are fairly quick to respond on most of the planes (at least as quick as historical accuracy will allow) so you needn't worry on that count.  The game boasts over 30 aircraft from the period, each of which represents one of the four main European air powers during the Second World War: Britain, Germany, the US and Italy. Italy? That's right. Unfortunately you can only fly 12 of the planes -- four each from Britain, Germany and the US. British flyers will take to the skies in the Hawker Hurricane or Typhoon, the de Havilland Mosquito and the ubiquitous Spitfire. The German pilots will be able to fly three planes of the Messerschmitt line -- the 109, 163 and the jet-powered 262 -- and the Focke-Wolfe 190. US pilots will challenge the Germans with the P-40 Warhawk, P-38 Lightning, P-51 Mustang and, my personal favorite, the P-47 Thunderbolt. Hopefully Psygnosis will come out with a Pacific version of Nations that allows armchair flight jockeys to try their hand at the Corsair or Zeke.  The other two dozen planes are mostly bombers and cannot be piloted by the player. But it's a helluva lot of fun shooting them down. Big targets include the British Lancaster and Blenheim, the German V1 and Ju87 and 88, and the US B-17 Flying Fortress, B-25 Mitchell, B-24 Liberator and the awesome B-29 Superfortress. There are also four Italian planes, but nobody cares about those. Like everything else in this game, the bombers are either something to protect or something to destroy.  Each of the planes looks brilliant. The outside textures are really the best I've ever seen in this type of game. Each surface of the aircraft is highly detailed and full of the tiny imperfections and flaws that make it seem like a real object. We're all familiar with the modeling and textures that look ~too perfect~ to be truly believable. That's not an issue here. But you won't spend too much time looking at the outside of your plane. Your attention will be focused on the cockpit instrumentation. Psygnosis doesn't disappoint here either. Each cockpit is unique and based on their real-life counterparts. The cockpit views are well implemented (except for the lack of an ~up~ on the joystick hat switch) including a padlock view.   While we're on the subject of graphics, I should mention that the game world looks great. While there are some significant problems, the lighting and cloud effects are superb. Your instrument panel will brighten or dim depending on your position relative to the sun. It's that kind of attention to detail that really makes Nations stand out. The sunrise and sunset effects are also fabulous. Add 3D clouds that actually look like clouds (except for some slight blockiness) and rain effects and you've got a good-looking game. And the ground looks just as good in most places. The graphics system is scalable so you can play it on lower end systems, but even on my Micron I noticed some ugly frame rate problems. The game boasts a limited mission recorder and a very useful in-game camera that you can use to get a closer look at some of the eye-popping goodness around you.  There are three campaigns in Nations -- one each for the three nationalities. Each campaign is composed of 15 missions. The missions are ~representative~ of all of the mission types flown in WWII. Not only will you get the chance to mix it up with enemy squadrons, you'll also be asked to take out ground and sea targets, intercept and escort bombers and V1 craft and scramble to protect your base from enemy attack. Up to 60 planes may be in the air at any one time, so battles can get pretty hairy. The instant action option includes 10 mission types, but I found that there weren't enough variables to set in terms of enemy composition. A random mission generator is sorely needed here to break up the eventual monotony you'll experience once you've flown the missions a few times. A training mode will help you get the basics of take-off and landing down, which is odd because you're hardly ever called on to land or take-off in the missions. Most of the time, your plane begins in mid-air.  There's a multiplayer element to the game that can be played over LAN or the internet but it only supports eight players. There are only two modes of play. Can you guess what they are? That's right -- deathmatch and team deathmatch. Obviously, it's hard to be inventive in this area, especially when it comes to flight sims, but Psygnosis has added a new twist to the time-honored dogfight by including mid-air power-ups. While it's a genuine effort to add some interest to what might be a dull experience, it falls short. Grabbing power ups on the fly is way the hell hard. Still it will please some players.  So like I said, this is a great first effort for Psygnosis and I hope Nations does well enough to prompt the company to develop other titles along these lines. I liked the flight model and the look of the game, but the limitations of the campaigns and single missions had me longing for the days of Aces of the Pacific. While this is a much prettier game and has a lot more to offer in terms of flight physics, you run out of things to do too quickly. My only other concern is the frame rate problem. When the game's minimum frame rate slider only goes up to 15fps, you know you've got a problem. But until you tire of the missions or the frame rate begins to bug you, Nations is well worth checking out.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Nov 11, 1999"}
