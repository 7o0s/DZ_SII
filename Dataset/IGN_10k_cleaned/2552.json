{"name": "Diggles", "name_review": "Diggles Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/13/diggles-review", "text": "Once upon a time, Odin was an idiot. It's bad enough the overlord of everything Viking decided to fashion the old world of Midgard out of giant corpse, but now Godfather feeble has gone and lost his wee, loveable puppy, Fenris. Wee for a Norse God translates to massive and scary for the rest of us, while loveable is of course synonymous with hell conquering. Though the actors and scenery are familiar, this mythical Norse play is certainly anything but traditional.  Somehow escaping the binds of his magical leash, the Gleipnir, Fenris ran off into the underworld where he now sits unopposed, free to spread his doggy terror. In come the Diggles (a clan of dwarves -- the race Odin finally got around to creating sometime after the seas and before the fabled Doritos). Diggles are stocky, soil lovers at home in the under-earth. They agree to reclaim Odin's pooch not because of love or faith, or even for the gold, wine, mead, and divine powers that have been promised to them, but rather for full Viking-esque beards. ZZ Top would be so proud. But what of the women Diggles? Do they too become blessed with thick and full facial hair?  This backstory proves to be but the beginning of a lighthearted, quirky romp through an original land that claims to be strategic, but winds up involving far more the way of character management and observance than actual strategy.  Getting right to the point, the game is presented in what is conventionally referred to as 2.5 dimensions. The world of Diggles can be likened to looking into a countertop aquarium. Height and width can be quite sizable, and though it has some depth, it lacks considerably. All characters, models, and scenery are entirely rendered in 3D, but come played on a relatively 2D plane (like looking into said fish home or more accurately, an ant farm).  This works, aside from a few nagging interface related inconveniences. Because you never really have to worry about the Z axis, managing all of your small clan on just the vertical and the horizontal planes is greatly simplified. Remarkably enough, there still exists some disorientation, poor camera work, and difficulty in selecting exactly what you want to control.  Things get in the way of other things. To alleviate this problem, the developers at Innonics have included a simplistic camera zoom and tilt feature. You can zoom in and out, as well as slightly tilt the gameworld up, down, left, or right with a combination of button and mouse movement. Never is it possible to be directly in line or above the characters as they move about the play field, but the world can be tilted enough to make managing units and buildings fairly easy, serving not as a solution to, but rather a means by which to ease a sometimes troublesome interface.  Because it's not possible to achieve a true top-down perspective, it often happens that attempts to manipulate a certain object result in the inadvertent highlighting of something else (the foreground background overlapping effect). Imprecise bounding boxes and bafflingly unresponsive drag-and-dropping amplify this problem. Thankfully, there only ever being a scant few manageable units to contend with ultimately causes this annoyance to remain just that, and not climb to the dreaded rank of ~I threw my mouse at the wall because this game's interface is so debilitating.~  2.5D also works graphically. Color usage is varied and all characters have a cute and whimsical look about them, except perhaps the freakish and belligerent fairy that Peer resents for being adorned in Bavarian garments, thus disgracing his noble, always trying to conquer the world heritage. The inhabitants of Midgard are not the most technologically advanced creatures around, nor is the world remarkably anything, aside from big, well colored, and decently detailed.   A particular eyesore is the lacking amount of animations. Dwarves are endowed with a figurative ton of animated routines that they cycle through, especially when idle (knitting, push-ups, frolicking), but everything is noticeably jerky and underdeveloped. Diggles stutter when they walk, glitch when they pick things up, and transition from one movement to another without ever drawing the necessary frames between. Additionally, facial animation is severely lacking. Peer's hated belligerent fairy looks like a sad case of a prostitute gone heroine overdose.   It's unfathomable how the game could run as poorly as it does. On a Pentium 4 1.5GHz with 256MB of RAM and a GeForce 3 Ti 500, Diggles played and scrolled choppily at 1024x768 and high detail settings, a combination scientifically classified as ~butter~ for just about every other game under the sun. On systems with lesser processing power, but also armed with GeForce 3 video cards, performance degraded from stuttering to a painfully slow kind of crash happy unplayable.  Music is technically awesome, the opening load (as damn freaking long as it is), is complimented by a heightening and quickening piece that really chimes in as pleasing. Combat causes in-game tunes to pick up, but a majority of play is done amidst very mellow, soothing to tiring melodies that serve as both a cure for insomnia and a way to stifle and sooth crying babies. Again, technically sound, just perhaps a bit too elevator-ish to be beneficial.  Even though the goofy Odin sounds like a disgruntled Irishman, voice acting remains passable, at least from a delivery standpoint. Writing, on the other hand, reeks of poor translation and way too much effort. Let's put it this way, not funny is far preferable to trying to be funny but failing miserably. I should know; I do it all the time... See. Worse, conversations in the many cutscenes are, for no apparent reason, plagued with lengthy pauses that conclude with poorly delivered punch lines of no substance. Because I don't care to torment my mind with recalling an exact example, I give you my rendition: Hey, I don't like that. ...  ...  ...  Let's get to work then, troll head.  Okay. I don't like fairies and your shovel. ...  ...  ...  Hahaha! Hahaha!   Yeah, funny. I assure you my thumb and forefinger caressing my brow and the slight smirk on my face is not an expression of approval. Don't mistake embarrassment and shame for praise.  Graphics and sound aside, Diggles is about the Diggles. The game doesn't involve assembling a massive army and taking on the enemy. It's about getting the clan to perform rather simplistic, but often laborious tasks to complete an end, all the while developing the individual characters with attributes earned through action.      You won't have legions of Diggles with which to abuse, but instead just a handful. As play begins it becomes necessary to manage their wants and needs against your own. Diggles need food, which requires gathering and cooking; rest, which requires not working on something else; socializing, which requires two or more Diggles not working; and so on. Each aspect is balanced against another (get them drunk and make them happy at the cost of decreasing their awareness). Furthermore, unsatisfied, exhausted, and hurt Diggles are Diggles more prone to disobeying your commands, causing the progress to slow even further. The focus of the game is then predominately centered around providing for and managing your little clan. This takes a long time.  Foremost, work shifts that are constantly tinkered with need to be established so that Diggles have time to rest. What a Diggle can accomplish in a standard work shift isn't much. It takes them forever to do anything. See, you don't just begin the development of a tent at the fireplace and then place it when construction completes (choose a building in C&C and then place it). Instead, Diggles will first gather all required materials; then, each will be prepared and packed into a single box. From there, the packed box can be selected and unpacked at a chosen destination: another building cycle entirely! Each step takes a long time, worsened by the fact that sometimes the Diggles will pause for a few seconds, leaving you wondering whether work is actually being done or not. Fast forward is allowed, but once engaged prohibits control of any kind, forcing players to view whatever screen they left on without any of the HUD's vital components until the turbo is disengaged. You can't even see the clock.  The whole thing is like this... Slowly move forward. Slowly build stuff. Deal with dwarves by slowly feeding them. Let them slowly frolic and quickly procreate (it's still realistic). Slowly begin it all anew. Imagine the game as a checklist of tasks that need be completed for success... Dig tunnel. Assemble materials. Build buildings. Take care of dwarves. Allocate three minutes to cuddling (again, realistic). Etc.  Fortunately, the checklist is very long, offering plenty to slowly do. Helping to lighten this load that would quickly degenerate into a painful exercise in tedium if not constantly and tirelessly monitored is a great degree of automation that can, of course, always be superceded if so chosen. Clicking on an object, for instance, and telling that object to build another will automatically delegate a dwarf currently in his or her work shift to the task. Not only will that dwarf begin construction, but will also acquire all of the necessary materials to do so, so long as they are in the line of sight of any dwarf inhabited area or boundary stone . As pleasant of an addition as this is (one that would be killer in a few traditional RTS titles), automation, as the Terminator so vividly demonstrates, is not always a good thing.  Opting to build another structure or taking on another task sometimes pulls dwarves off of their duties you assigned earlier (such as tunneling), while still leaving stubborn idle ones stubbornly idle. So maybe that dwarf's mood is at 50%, and that's why he's not taking on the task, that's still no excuse to pull one I had assigned elsewhere without so much as a warning. Unresponsiveness without indication, however deliberate, is never fun. And when I assign a tunnel to be dug, I'd like all available dwarfs to get with the digging.  Managing all that's transpiring isn't too much of a hassle once the many stat windows and hotkeys are clamped down and understood. With a touch of a button or glance at an icon or indicator (each Diggle wears a funny hat depending on what they're doing, as an example) you can pretty much determine or do anything, allowing easier interaction with all of the little goobers, sporadic interface problems mentioned above not withstanding.    Keeping the clan going isn't just about setting arbitrary work shifts and making sure everyone is on track. Coupling male and female Diggles together is vital for procreation (the little baby Diggles are funny, and can strangely enough, also be assigned work shifts). Efforts must be put in setting up which Diggles have their off hours together so that to maintain a clean and powerful bloodline and prevent all that terrible inbreeding that might result from only five dwarves getting it on. Matching mates allows specific traits to be inherited to the youth. This develops through the campaign, which plays out with RPG reminiscent development and side quests (of which there are many). The campaign is a long wander fest -- just build your base until something of note happens. With that kind of take on things, it's sad the tutorial doesn't delve further into the intricacies of game, leaving even this simplistic and fundamental aspect a bit trying.  What did you think of Diggles?  Slowly playing out like the rest of the game, combat also features a similar amount of automation. If rival units meet they will begin clubbing each other until one dies. Weapons that have been accumulated must rest within the limited inventory of a unit to be put into effect (if multiple weapons exist, one is automatically chosen based on a number of factors). This makes inventory management and the advancement of combat skills just more items on the checklist. We can neither casually disregard nor scorn Diggles, wrongly believing it to be a failed RTS attempt. The game is more about ensuring your units are willing and able to complete their tasks than it is about actually completing the tasks at hand. Herein can be found the fundamental difference between Diggles and other strategic titles... There is no real substantial strategy involved, but rather layers of management that are handled through regular checkups. Can you see the resources you need? Are your dwarves happy? Are they working? Is that tunnel being completed? Is that dwarf's inventory full? Are the work shifts set up properly? Do you have the right characters performing the right tasks so that they develop correctly? Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera (the repetition is intended to hammer in this notion).That's not to say this concept is necessarily terribly bad. Contrarily, hundreds of quality games are built off of this precept (that includes some of today's most popular). The problem is that, in Diggles, it all comes together somewhat disorganized, problematic, and slowly, leaving the game's solid premise and clever design imperfect and narrowly appealing. It's a waiting game. You follow and care for your clan, asking them to undertake assignments. Sadly, pretty much all of what they do takes forever to complete. So, enjoyment must then be found in taking care of the clan itself. Even this grows tiresome because it inherently draws from the tasks that must be completed to advance the game, and also happens to be largely automated. The result is overuse of the turbo key and sometimes sleepy eyes.Still, Diggles is original and adorable in a freakish kind of way. It's because of this that I recommend the title, but only under a ~try before you buy~ clause. If, in testing the game's waters, you find that the slow pace and emphasis on human dwarf relations are enjoyable, you'll certainly cherish the rest of this rather long effort.", "date": "Mar 13, 2002"}
