But what seems like a sure thing -- the marriage of the phenomenally successful Sims license with the rabidly faithful community of online gamers -- The Sims Online has less in common with MMO standards such as EverQuest than it does with more traditional chat programs. In other words, the focus shifts from conflict against a specific force or enemy to socializing with friends online. When done against the backdrop of a wildly successful license, it can be quite compelling. But the game is necessarily limited by its concept and fails to deliver on some of its potential.   So, Where Are You Guys From?  The original Sims tasked players with the management of families and communities. From a godlike perspective you could toy with your Sims needs and wants and watch your subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes take effect within the game world. Tweak one room in the house and the dynamic of the family shifts somewhat. Advance a relationship with one Sim and watch as the other inhabitants of your neighborhood adjust to the new arrangement.   The basic needs are still present in the game. Players still get hungry and sleepy and dirty and you have to find the time to eat and sleep and shower. But this time, instead of directing the lives of all of your Sims, you'll only be in charge of the actions of one. The other Sims you'll meet are all human players as well so the range of interactions broadens somewhat but is, by design, less scripted.   So The Sims Online replaces the god-like control as the conscience of your Sims with a more individual, slightly selfish approach. Now limited to just one Sim, I wondered who I'd design. Me? Someone I'd like to be? Someone I'd hate? In the end I wound up with a guy who's slightly stuffy but still sociable. I'm not normally a gregarious person but I gladly broke out of my shell once behind the security of a virtual mask and had a wild time. I'm not proud of some of my actions but, hey, these all night chess parties don't throw themselves, you know.   That's a new dynamic for The Sims Online. Rather than having you reach certain prerequisites to achieve particular job levels, The Sims Online lets you practice your skills on new job objects. In the logic area, you can earn money by solving equations on a blackboard. Charismatic sims can earn cash by using a new telemarketer's phone. The cash and skill rewards for performing these actions are highest when you're doing them with a group of other people. The landscape of The Sims Online therefore primarily consists of houses where people have set up food, bed and showers next to a whole group of these job objects. And since the owners of the house get a little kickback for your sales, they want to keep you happy.   Like EverQuest without the Rats  That's exactly how one Sim-fanatic describes the game. In truth, while The Sims has been described as a game without a clear ~point,~ the online version seems even less conflict oriented and more susceptible to aimlessness. Spinning the three plates of a healthy social life with a clean and happy home and a profitable profession was endlessly fascinating for fans of the original game. This time around, your social network, which was previously a prerequisite for better jobs, is merely the subjective product of your own interaction with people. Likewise your ~job~ is now a casual affair that you can pick up and drop as you like.   Now that earning wages and maintaining friendships aren't as tightly tied to the element of time, the game is much more open-ended. No longer do you have to worry about getting to bed in time to get up for work the next morning. No longer do you have to worry about missing out on much-needed social interaction because you're cooking dinner. Remove the need to go to work and maintain relationships from The Sims and you've got a game that's almost too easy to play.   But in some ways this is very smart, as it frees up the players to focus on interacting with one another rather than cleaning toilets and fixing breakfast. But it also removes a bit of the energy from the game as well. Rather than a race against the clock, you're now presented with a ~get there when you get there~ approach. Other players will be more than happy to provide you with the beds, meals and bathroom facilities that you'll need.   I spent quite a long stretch as a transient, hopping from one house to another. Many of the property owners are happy enough to have people in their home both to add a small revenue injection as well as to serve as a magnet for other players. I actually joked with one property master that I'd just been telling people I lived with her. For a few days, I honestly did.   If you do get tired of bumming around and crashing at other people's houses you can try to create your own pad. Maxis have done a good thing by limiting your funds to 10,000 simoleans, effectively forcing players to take roommates if they want to build the types of houses that will attract other players and thereby bring in revenue for the household.   But in pushing players to house together in groups, the developers have increased the confusion and change for abuse. I gave my property manager several thousand simoleans last week and have yet to see any paint on the walls of our unfinished (and therefore unprofitable) home. I bought $6000 worth of logic equipment which is just sort of sitting around until he decides to finish the house enough that we can have people over.   Even though the economic momentum behind the game is sound, The Sims Online has yet to implement a player-run market of commodities and items. How much more compelling would the game be if the players could act as vendors for more of the items in the game? It certainly would be preferable to the faceless market that currently buys up the fruits of your labor.   So although the money-making is a key feature of the game and although it could be expanded to make your day-to-day actions more meaningful and profitable, I have to fall back on the defense that The Sims Online really isn't a business simulation. Although that's the primary mechanism for making money and hence owning and doing cool things, the real point of The Sims Online is socializing. As such, it's better as a place to hang out than it is a place to accomplish a series of goals.    Real Pool and the Orgasim  All games are a substitute for experience, fictional or otherwise and in the case of The Sims you're treated to a simplified but compelling replacement for ~ordinary~ life -- no superpowers, no orcs and no multi-engine starships. Now, you're either in one or two camps here. First, you could feel that the relative simplicity and convenience of your Sims life made a nice antidote to the hectic and less-quantifiable real world. Or you might think that this constant toilet-fixing and plant watering is a bit too close to the banalities of your own life to seem very entertaining. Personally I find it hard enough to find time to wash the dishes in my own house, much less trying to find time to do it in the game.   But that's not to say that the game isn't extremely compelling. This aquarium-like existence is guaranteed to draw almost anyone in -- whether this initial fascination lasts beyond the first week or so depends on the people you meet and your own expectations for the game.   The anonymous nature of The Sims Online is liberating for most players. The ability to be someone different and act on impulses that aren't safe or natural or comfortable in real life is a huge part of what I like about the game. With all forms of liberation, some will take greater advantage of it than others.   From a standpoint of content and attitude, The Sims Online can sometimes exhibit a decidedly sleazy tone. In a perfect reflection of both the nature of some online communities and The Sims itself, there are a number of off-color topics and slightly questionable references. There are plenty of places where your Sim can exercise their need to flirt and even a few places where your Sim can exercise...other things.   At some point, frequenting the less righteous (some would say ~less uptight~) housing lots, you're bound to run in to situations where the double entendres give way to those of the single kind. Moving from the mildly racy, ~Your melons look so delicious,~ to the straight-up, ~Hey, who wants to @#*!?~ reveals another dimension to the game, one that some will embrace, others will shun, and some will say they shun but secretly embrace. There's a wide variety of experiences to be had, most of which lean much more towards the mildly scandalous than the outright obscene. Still, if you know where to look, you can find someone to have exchange naughty messages over the game's instant message client.   You can filter the obscenity and add Sims to your Ignored list but the content of the game still permits things like charging money for a pixilated ride in the love bed. (As a professional reviewer, I'm keen on experiencing all that a game has to offer -- it's not like I'm not a tramp or anything.) The game itself is rated Teen and while I think that's perfectly appropriate, parents should at least be aware of what their kids might encounter. Of course, since your parents don't read IGN...   A New Skin?  To someone who's been following games for a while (or even someone who's just been following The Sims) the online version is a bit of a letdown in terms of graphics. Incorporating the old assets and models is a great way to keep the interest and comprehension high among current players of The Sims. It's also a great way to make your game look two years old. The Sims has aged well, to be sure, but the lack of any substantial improvement to the graphics isn't helping.   What did you think of The Sims Online?   This is even more irritating given that the game suffers from a slight lag, even on high-end connections. Characters exhibited frequent warping on my DSL at home and even here at the office, there are some small lag issues, even in the chat interface. The camera also still tracks with the same stutter as before which can be irritating.   Ditto for the sound. I quite liked music and dialogue from the original game but, as with the graphics, this is another case where something new would have benefited the game greatly.Flame if you will but I still have a bit of a hard time labeling this as a ~game.~ While there are similar problems with the original The Sims, the element of time and quantified social interactions provided a real sense of challenge and conflict that's completely missing here. With other Sims acting as patrons and offering free beds, free food and free skill objects, the only real motivation to go out and succeed is in becoming one of these patrons yourself.But since the patron system usually involves the coordination of several players' stakes in the game, there is the potential for abuse -- or at least confusion. I've seen lots of wonderfully modeled properties in the game but there are an equal number of unfinished and ~pending~ pads. I'll continue to play it for a while longer. It makes an excellent way to pass the time but it's definitely a game you can play out of the corner of your eye when there's something good on TV.", "date": "Jan 13, 2003"}
