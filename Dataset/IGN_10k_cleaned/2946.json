The shattered promises of Robotech: Crystal Dreams on the N64 and the Macross themed games on PSX left many gamers yearning for something that felt, looked and sounded like the heavily edited, yet beloved animated program from 1985.   Developer Vicious Cycle had access to every bit of Robotech goodness Harmony Gold could give them while putting this game together and it shows. However when we say Robotech: Battlecry emulates every aspect of the television show that includes the annoying parts too. The ships, battles and explosions of both the game and the show are great and would compel anybody to invest themselves in Robotech. If the show could be slowed down by the multiple drawn out love stories, then the game certainly gets bogged down by gameplay that eventually gets repetitive and cheesy AI that doesn't present enough new challenges.     Gameplay  There's certainly more good than bad in Robotech and the developers nailed the most important  part of any Robotech themed game: the Veritech fighters. Switching between Guardian, Fighter, Battloid at the flick of the D-pad is extremely handy and very important control element of the game. Because each Veritech form has different special moves and slightly different weapon attributes, Battlecry eventually forces you to make snap decisions and switch to the most effective form when the situation demands it. In a dogfight in space, you'll spend most of your time in jet fighter form since you'll need the long range missiles and speed to battle the Zentraedi battle pods and ships. But when you're faced with overwhelming odds --which is usually how the game steps up the difficulty-- like six or seven enemies launching a half dozen missiles at you each launching the fighter's countermeasures may not be enough to get you out of trouble. A quick switch to Battloid mode and a tap of the secondary fire button (machine guns, in all three modes, are always the primary fire) will put the Battloid's rapid fire rifle to use shooting incoming missiles out of the air.   The uniqueness of each Veritech form continues with the control scheme and special abilities. The human looking Battloid mode gives you access to the high-powered rifle as we mentioned above with both rapid fire and single shot function as well as sniper function which is usually only applied in sniper-specific missions. It can fly by use of the jets in its feet but it's much slower and extremely maneuverable compared to the Guardian and Fighter modes. The Jet fighter is the obviously the fastest and least maneuverable but its missiles have the greatest range and its countermeasures are extremely handy when you need to divert enemy missiles away from a target like an important convoy for the Earth Defense Forces or a recon ship. The Guardian is supposed to split the difference between the Battloid and Fighter modes so you get the arms and legs as well as the cockpit section and wings. The missiles of the Guardian are powerful but don't have as much range as the Fighter's. The Guardian's special ability allows you to pick up objects with one of the hands.     Each Veritech has different controls for getting around. Where pressing the turbo button in Fighter mode sweeps the wings backs and kicks on the afterburners, the same button activates the hover jets in the Battloid and propels you upward. Likewise, hitting turbo in Guardian mode pushes you forward but you've got to hold it down to keep moving. So in quickly switching around the different forms, you also have to be ready for the new control scheme so that you'll immediately benefit from that form.   Vicious Cycle nailed the Veritechs right down to the one, two or four lasers mounted in the heads of the VF-1A, VF-1J and VF-1S and the different armor, speed, agility, missile power and targeting systems of each. When you unlock the battle armor for space missions you get the booster rockets and added missile capacities for all three forms. As cool as the armor is, the enemies don't let you enjoy it for very long since they absolutely bombard you once they see it.  Where Robotech: Battlecry stumbles is in the variety and challenges of missions. There are five chapters with up to 14 missions in each and little cinemas between each to advance the story line as told from Jack Archer's (Wolf 10) perspective. While it's great to see Lisa Hayes and Roy Fokker pop up in the cinemas and on the communicator, what ends up happening is a repetitive mix of search & rescue, assault, timed defense and escort missions with a few subtle variations of each. Also you're limited to either space/air dogfights or land based battles. Sometimes in the dogfights there will be a Zentraedi cruiser or other structure you can land on so you can slug it out in Battloid mode and likewise there will be times where zooming through a land mission in a jet will help you out. But by the time you're halfway through the game you will have seen every type of mission variable there is.  You'll notice the cheesiness of R:B when you face the numerous Zentraedi bosses that always end up picking fights with you. Their missiles and lasers seem hundreds of times more powerful than anything you've faced up to that point and suddenly your missiles and machine guns can't pierce Zentraedi armor. Furthermore there will be times when you'll be expected to face some bosses with whatever health you have left after you've fought through a mission with waves of enemies. In platform games this is understandable, but it gets frustrating in Robotech: Battlecry because it degenerates into a dodge-attack routine that undermines the coolness of the ships and themes of the Robotech universe.      The combat in Robotech is a mixed bag. The animation on the rifles and missiles is great but it can be hard to understand what's going on with countermeasures and machine guns in a huge battle. It's very common for your screen to fill up with enemies, rocket trails, smoke, jet thrusters and detailed backgrounds making it tough to see incoming enemy fire. This is more of a camera problem because an enemy can tear you to shreds if they end up in one of several blind spots. Off screen and near the bottom middle --where your Veritech is usually located-- are the usual sweet spots for the enemies. However this is balanced by the fact that you can blind side enemies as well or launch attacks from a distance when you're in jet fighter mode. The key to combat in Robotech is to keep moving and use the radar to your advantage because with infinite ammo for both guns and missiles (though you can deplete your immediate supply with overuse) and no health pickups in this game, you're rewarded for swift and constant action.   The game's multiplayer split screen mode is forgettable because the two player splitscreen action is totally betrayed by a troubled camera system. In the single player missions, it's very common for you to be shooting at targeted enemies off screen because the camera doesn't swing around to keep you and them on screen at the same time like in, say, Spider-Man. The same thing happens in two player mode, but what's the point of playing against someone if you spend most of the time looking at their view screen to find them?   Graphics  Robotech: Battlecry looks better than DVDs of the television show. We really liked the cel-shaded look of the Veritechs in Robotech because it's not overwhelming and updates the cartoon series look for the 21st century. The animation on the Veritech is outstanding as well whether it's the transformation from one mode to another or the movements of the Battloid in close combat.   The Zentraedi ships and other earth force ships like the Destroids and recon ships aren't nearly as well animated as the Veritechs but you'll be able to appreciate the detail of every craft in the game. You'll notice the arm cannons on the officer's battle pods and the different head configurations on the Veritechs. When you unlock the different skins you'll see the black and gold of Roy Fokker's Skull One, Rick Hunter's red and white paint job and the sweet stealth Veritech's black paint job.  The animation is so well done that you'll be able to re-create some scenes you wished you had scene in the show as well as some of the ones you do remember. Battloid's skid to a stop and put their hands up as if to create more wind resistance after you release the turbo button and they kick their legs forward to fly backwards with their foot thrusters. When you're in space the spent shells from your Battloid's machine gun float, instead of dropping. Little details like that will bring a smile to any Robotech fan's face. When the Guardian's grab objects the swoop down with the left hand and keep moving. The only significant Veritech animation that's missing that we remember from the show is that ~skating~ Guardian move where one foot is forward and the other is back dragging its toe.   The lighting effects are pretty much limited to the Veritechs (we're sensing a theme here) and are better than you'd expect. The bright colored buildings of the cities is a bit puzzling since we don't remember anything like that from the television program. But the coolest single visual effect that'll take you back to '85 more than any other is the missile/explosion sequence. The smoke trails on rockets are visible anywhere on the screen and the orange-yellow explosion is absolutely classic.     As we said there's a little something weird going on with the camera system since you can spend a lot of time whirling around trying to see who's shooting you and who you're shooting. We couldn't come with an alternative system if we had to, but the maneuverability of the camera doesn't keep up with maneuverability of the different Veritech modes. You'll often end up using the fighter mode whenever possible because the camera is best adapted for that mode, plus those missiles are just super powerful.  Sound  With many of the original voice actors lending their talents to the game, the audio authenticity is outstanding. Throw in the fact that all of the original music has been included and it's clear the developers were going for the total Robotech experience.   The surround sound process was a little disappointing with the team at Vicious Cycle opting for a generic four channel setup so that you get everything around you but no center channel and no bass coming from the subwoofer.   Like we said the voice acting is as good as the show because it's the same cast of characters, but the voice you'll hear the most, Jack Archer, gets extremely repetitive. He says ~It's time to take these guys to school~ so often that you sometimes don't mind getting obliterated by the Zentraedi just so you can hear them give a little comeback.   The sound effects are decent with rocket fire and machine gun fire heard pretty much from beginning to end. The transformation sounds on the Veritech are especially satisfying with a whoosh for the Jet Fighter and a very ~The Transformers~-like breakdown sound effect for the Guardian and Battloid. The targeting sound effect gets super annoying after several hours of play. Robotech:Battlecry quickly satisfied the Robotech fan in me with its excellent attention to detail in the Veritech fighters. I recommend skipping the tutorial mode just to get the thrill of flying a VF-1 that was 17 years in the making. I do have to admit that it became a different kind of game beyond the first chapter, where the bulk of the familiar Robotech-Macross Saga stories take place. It's a fun arcadey shooter that requires a new set of skills thanks to the transformations but the mountain of missions that sort of run together after awhile prevent Robotech from being a truly great game. Fans of the show should definitely pick this one up for your favorite system, not because it's another piece of memorabilia, but because it's a nice, controllable manifestation of a show you love. Console gamers who could care less about a Robotech license will appreciate the transforming, hectic style of combat this game offers, but will likely run into the same walls I did after awhile. That said, we'll all be on the lookout for the sequel (it's called Battlecry for a reason) and the promise of enhanced everything.", "date": "Sep 19, 2002"}
