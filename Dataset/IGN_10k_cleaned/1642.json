{"name": "No Escape", "name_review": "No Escape", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/15/no-escape", "text": "Maybe you've seen this box around your local software store, sporting a couple of quotes from the altogether shady ~ign.com.~ The game's No Escape, the quotes were from Stephen and I, and they're totally true. This is Quake for kids -- an attempt to give younger gamers a chance to experience all the fast action fury of first person online shooters, gut without the gore factor or incredible violence that accompany those games. Unfortunately, the lack of violence is about all that No Escape ends up accomplishing correctly. Filled with funky characters and bright ideas, but sorely lacking in implementation, the game ends up as a pretty but shallow attempt to simplify the online fragfest.  If you've checked out the preview, you know that No Escape is another take on the game show genre, giving you a world of characters to choose from, and a wild variety of miniature planets to battle on in an attempt to win the big, big money and come off as the big winner. That's about as far as the plot gets, because since this game is basically modeled on Quake III, you won't spend much (or any) time on a storyline. Like other online fraggers, you can play against bots, in a LAN game, or over the Internet with anonymous No Escapers from around the world. There are even a variety of gametypes available to you that will be familiar if you've played any recent fraggers, such as Capture the Flag and team play. Because the game isn't focused on kills, the default setting is all about money -- hit enemies, and coins bounce off of them that you can snatch up for bucks. A ~knockout~ gives you a wad of cash, and other bundles of bucks are hidden around the level for you to find. Of course, you can also play a straight-up fragfest, or other interesting variant like a timebomb game where you're stuck with a bomb on your back, and it's up to you to knockout other playing to add time to your countdown timer. Run out of time, and boom -- you lose.  Once you've picked the sort of game you want to play, it's time to jump in and get to the fragging. The characters are the highlight of No Escape, and while picking Barry 2000 the robot over Pei Ling the ninja might not give you any advantages, it's still fun to run around as a screeching bucket of death, or as the ex-head of an aerobic dojo. The character movies are incredible, and ooze with humor. For instance, pick Bratney the rockstar and you can witness her perform a hardcore punk concert before retiring to her rich palatial manor with her dowdy upper-class parents. Alright, so maybe it plays better than it sounds, but you've learned to trust my judgement by now, right? Forget the last few reviews I've done. Okay, now that we're squared, let's talk some gameplay.   Jump in, run, jump and shoot. That's all you need to know. The game takes place on tiny planets, so as you run you'll constantly see the environment curve sharply in the distance. You control in third person, but you use an aiming reticle like Quake to fire with, allowing you run around on different heights while still being able to fire independently. Being able to run around tiny worlds that spin around under your feet is pretty cool, especially given the funpark atmosphere of the art design -- but it also works against itself when it comes to gameplay. It's much harder to avoid other characters and hide when the visibility is so broad, and aiming in general is a lot harder, so you'll end up feeling like you're in a mindless free for all more than a target-rich fragfest. Add to this the fact that characters take forever to knockout, and you'll wonder if you're even making an impact firing a ton of rockets into an opponent.  The point of all this, of course, is that you're supposed to have fun firing off for hours, without having the beginner's problems in FPS multiplayer games of dying every minute. It sounds nice, but when you're used to fast action, it's a little annoying to fire a barrage of rockets into an opponent, only to have them run away like nothing happened. The weapons are pretty fun to mess around with however, particularly the bouncing bombs, which allow you to toss little bouncing grenades of death into your enemies vicinity, and the rocket, which fire out in exaggerated arcs like served tennis balls. And of course, for those of you that appreciate pure brute force, there's always the atom bomb.  The graphics and characters are charming, especially if you're into shows like Thunderbirds that feature the big-headed, odd-faced character designs that are mimicked here in No Escape. The planets are filled with the same sort of charm, all odd angles and bright colors, with super deformed landscapes that twisting and mazelike without ever becoming too confusing. Unfortunately, there's also not a lot of difference between them overall, other than the general themes. The wild west comes off just like Barry's robotic world, due to the simplistic structure of the game and the levels themselves. The angle of the game limits height, so you're stuck running around the same small mazes and playing fields, with just different textures to keep you interested. Voice acting and music is pretty solid however, particularly the campy cartoon voices of the characters, who chatter constantly as they get hit/hit you. It's all very console, which is a good or a bad thing depending on how much hardcore you were expecting in the title.  Finally, and most importantly, there's multiplayer. Right now No Escape's got some major Internet problems, not the least of which is what seems like a total lack of servers on the web at this point. Being able to set up your own bot battles is great, but if you were ready to take on the pint-sized world, it ain't going to happen at this point. A LAN game was a breeze to set up though, but we had horrible lag problems that plagued us as characters literally popped around the screen instead of running smoothly, making the game incredibly frustrating. If the game had a single player adventure to hold on to it wouldn't be so crushing, but given that the single player game is about as deep as Quake III's, and given that the multiplayer game is the entire focus of this title, it's a pretty bad scene in mudville for those of you thinking about this as a perfect online game for your youngin's.  No Escape, while filled with some good ideas, is just way to shallow and simple to warrant the $29.99 pricetag (or the insanely massive gigabyte load space), especially given that the multiplayer game just isn't together at this point. If your kids are looking for an online fix, you might be better to wait until Pokemon Catch-Em-All 2001 Online Superblast Gamecube Celebrity Smash  comes out.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
