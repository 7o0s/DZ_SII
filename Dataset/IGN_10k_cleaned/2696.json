{"name": "Muscle Car 2: American Spirit", "name_review": "Muscle Car 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/06/muscle-car-2", "text": "From the publishing house that brought us Moraff's Maximum Mahjongg V2 and Serious Sam for the Palm OS, comes Muscle Car 2...a game. ~It's just like that movie the Fast and the Furious!~ I can already hear some siren in the marketing department bewitching other hapless employees with unsubstantiated propaganda. ~Remember when that Diesel guy was driving that old car? You know, the old one?~ She continues, hassling a boy from IT, ~This is just like that! Oh my God, you'll flip!~And in a sense Barbra, the generic and habitually lying marketing type, is correct. When playing Muscle Car 2, players will flip, just not the way Barbra tells it. Rather, the flipping is more the very bad, raging, spatula tossing ~out~ kind of temporary insanity that later necessitates the taking of mass quantities of valium with wine that comes in tantalizing but taboo boxes and cans. Muscle Car 2, the ~racer~ from Globalstar, Talonsoft, Take 2 and 3Romans (Silverfish) should be played only long enough until these rhetorical questions come about: ~I wasted money on this game? I wasted the paper that money was printed on for this game?~ Not even the unfounded boasts of Barbra, the BMW driving life of every party you're not invited to, can counter that. Truth conquers all.There's nothing outwardly awry with Muscle Car 2, the box seems inconspicuous enough. It has a pretty foldout front, is adorned with artwork, screenshots, features... I feel genuine empathy for the lesser known, underappreciated people behind it. I can see a 25 year old working at his desk after hours to meet the critical Muscle Car 2 deadline he's been telling his wife about for the last week. He can't be home taking care of her and their newborn child because the box needs to be finished, the game needs to be shipped, the deadline needs to be met. So while all the lights in the fabled building that housed the creators of Muscle Car are off, his is on. And after the security guard casually saunters by to say hello (they're on a first name basis), he's still working, still trying. And for what? Me to smash dreams. It hurts me, earnest as I am, to think that somewhere along the lines someone must have been foolishly proud about this game. At Christmas dinner Grandma says one of the obscure programmer cousins no one voluntarily speaks to has something to show the family. So Uncle John sets down his glass of zinfandel and Grandpa Joe straightens his sweater vest and off to the family room they all go to witness this, the completed copy of Muscle Car 2, pride and joy of said forgotten relative. Uncomfortably, the entire extended family crowds around the wholly overpowered family PC normally reserved to cross reference recipes as the game is booted up. ~Is it supposed to look like that? Oh, so the random jerking to the left is a gameplay feature? Wow, that's neat. Now, why would I want this over say, that other racing game...PlayStation 2, I think it's called? How can I uninstall this without infecting my machine with a virus, now?~ Like in our youths when Dad would reassure us that the pivotal soccer game was not lost because we kicked the ball into our own goal on four nonconsecutive occasions, we too, now crowded around this PC on Christmas Eve watching this terrible game, secretly pray for a giant hawk to swoop down from the sky and grasp a few of us in its mighty beak. If only something as swift and dramatic could happen to abruptly end this dreaded awkwardness and web of lies that must be weaved to spare feelings, we'd all be happier. This game is terrible.Where shall we begin? Graphics? Sound? Gameplay? Hell, why don't we just save some time here and lump them all into a single, greater category? Let's call it Sogameics, or better yet, Graphoundameplay (pronounced Graph-ound-em-play). Now what shall we rate this newly made category by which all future terrible games can be condensed into, felt pen ass or Cheeto nards? As you can see, Graphoundameplay does not require a five star, percentile, or numeric rating system. Felt pen ass and Cheeto nards are descriptive and informative enough.Muscle Car 2 is ugly, bland, static, uninspired, poorly designed, and boring. It's strange, being based on the RenderWare platform, the same thing that powers Grand Theft Auto III and Burnout, one would expect more life, polish, and acuity from the title, but such is not the case. Cars are under detailed, damage modeling is not present, the environments are horrid and plagued with draw-in, and everything looks like giant blocks stuck on massive triangles precariously glued together with that stuff younger sisters use to stick glittery things on their jackets.But as bad as the game looks, it sounds worse. Cars make what feels like unauthentic but atypical muscle car gurgling noises. The stupid electronica music (I don't work for Rolling Stone and as such can't adequately classify every piece of crap I hear) is wretched, repetitious, and just plain goofy and out of place. And then there's the nitrous, or as I like to call it, that thing that should never ever be used. Ever lie awake at night wondering what it would sound like in real life when that bad guy from Mortal Kombat rips the soul out of a person? How about if he ripped the soul out of a Ring Wraith from Lord of the Rings? I figure it's comparable to grinding a buzz saw against a cyborg. First there's the metal on metal, then comes the shrieking of the cyborg himself.    But play, play is the worst. It's possible to use analog control, but please  don't . Not only is the game incapable of binding anything to anything (no control configuration and all), analog devices have a nasty tendency to over steer...all the time. But that's okay; keyboard control is more than adequate for the entire five minutes most people will play this game.It sure doesn't feel like I'm driving a beefy piece of American made automotive engineering. Are you sure these aren't battery powered? Muscle Car 2 plays more like an RC racer with abhorrent physics, frustrating races, and an astonishing lack of polish than anything. Don't bump another car or any other static obstruction because what results is worse than what occurred in the first Ridge Racer. Drastically slowing down is a frustrating thing, and since it clumsily happens all the time (power sliding is also a big no due to this) the races devolve into sometimes excruciatingly hard memorized runs with little fun and excitement. It doesn't help that the map is practically useless, the often rather open levels with ~shortcuts~ are difficult to navigate, the car inexplicably, sharply, and suddenly turns to the left, and there are no difficulty settings. What did you think of Muscle Car 2? Redemption? None, but in Bandit mode and parts of the game's career mode that spans some 25 races, Muscle Car 2 asks players to avoid the fuzz. This is not good, as they have rocket cars capable of effortlessly overtaking anything, anytime. Getting ran off the road with a fine or a warning seems to be entirely at the game's discretion. It's also not good because aside from one to four other racers and the cops, the roads are empty, thus unexciting. That's pretty much it. I could go delve into further specifics, citing still more problems and faults with the way the career mode plays out and the crazy swerving nature of the opposition. I could even talk about how not including multiplayer is a bad thing. Perhaps top it all off with witty comments and a bit of pretentious wisdom... But really, who cares? Play this game and I guarantee it won't be you. I just don't get it. I played the original Need for Speed what feels like a decade ago (in fact it was indeed about eight or nine years ago, in 1994, I believe). Since then how could racing games actually worsen and degenerate to this, such a sad, pathetic, and intolerable level? Everyone ballyhoos the miracle of modern technology, clamoring and salivating at just how amazingly far we've come. ~From Knight Rider to Ridge Racer,~ they boast. Well behold the miracle. Bask in its glory. Fathom how with it we can still be subject to such abysmal trash -- offerings that forsake all mandatory prerequisites of quality in this day and age and instead deliver the absolute minimum so that to barely qualify as a member of a genre. It features cars and green lights, therefore it is a racer.Muscle Car 2 looks awful, sounds worse, and barely plays. I've made Hooters Road Trip the butt of many an office joke in the past month, but even that effort was understandable: traffic, twitch, breasts, the promise of buffalo wings... But this, this is baffling in its mysterious inability to do anything worthy of pause, mention, or even smile. Muscle Car 2 is quite simply enough a waste of plastic, trees, and time. The noise it emits seems to frighten off neighborhood raccoons and possums, so it might be worthy of the twenty dollar admission fee when taken solely as a new means of pest control.", "date": "Jun 6, 2002"}
