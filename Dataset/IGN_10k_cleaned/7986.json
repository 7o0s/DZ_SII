It had been done before  on the NES, on the SNES. The TurboGrafx even supported up to five players in some games. But all of those prior systems needed something extra, some peripheral plug-in adapter that expanded the consoles' controller capacity. None of them was built with multiplayer in mind  until the Nintendo 64. With its third home machine, the Big N wanted to ensure that bringing three other players into play would be as easy as possible. The company wanted to promote the four-player dynamic, and pushed it forward by including four open controller ports on the front of the N64 case design. No extra adapter, no plug-in peripheral. The system was ready to go. Now it just needed a game.   Mario Kart 64 was Nintendo's flagship multiplayer title. It was February 1997, and the game was the first release for the Nintendo 64 to support up to four players at a time. For the first time, you and up to three friends could go head-to-head in racing for the finish line, or in combat-oriented battle arenas  scenarios that had been established years earlier in Super Mario Kart for the SNES, but that were expanded upon, enhanced and energized in the 64-bit jump.   There are more varieties of items, for example. Super Mario Kart had heat-seeking red shells  in Mario Kart 64, they're available in packs of three. The original's lone banana peels? Upgraded to full banana bunches, five at a time. And don't forget the infamous, leader-hunting blue shell. The bane of any first place driver, the spiny blue weapon of death first arrived here, on the N64.   MK64 also deepened the core racing gameplay of the series, through the addition of drifting, drafting and mini-turbos. The back-and-forth joystick motion that engages a quick extra boost of speed in corners has became a staple of the series, and it all started here, in this edition.   There's no arguing that Mario Kart 64 was an influential game, played and enjoyed by millions over the past 10 years. So the issue at hand becomes how the design has held up over that decade, and how properly it's been re-presented here on the Wii's Virtual Console. That verdict? Unfavorable.   The VC version of MK64 is technically flawed, in that it's hardware incompatible  on the Nintendo 64, the game utilized the ~plug it in to the back of the controller~ Controller Pak, a chunky plastic memory card peripheral that allowed for off-cartridge data saves. Mario Kart's specific use of the Pak was for storing Ghost Data, the spectral recordings of your best course runs from the game's Time Trial mode. You can't save them here.    The VC version simply acts like you don't have the Pak plugged in, which, of course, you don't. But couldn't Nintendo have taken the time to tweak the emulation just a bit? Get the game to recognize the Wii's internal storage capabilities and redirect the Ghost Data there instead?    The exclusion isn't hidden away. It's not being denied. It says quite prominently, before you download the game, that that function of the title has been rendered inoperable. But the situation speaks to the reality of the Nintendo 64's presence on the Virtual Console so far, giving some insight into why this is only the second title from the system to arrive after over two months have passed since the Wii system launch  the N64 games have problems when emulated, and so far there isn't any effort going into correcting those problems.   Sadly, that's not the only issue with this Virtual Console Kart. The game looks bad. Out-of-place odd. You may have noticed that the graphics of Super Mario 64 got a considerable upgrade in the leap to the Wii, its 3D environments rendered more crisply, cleanly and vibrantly than ever before. But you may have also noticed that the 2D elements in that title stood out from the rest of the world  the flattened trees, the HUD icons showing Mario's life total and energy level. It was plainly perceptible, but it wasn't that big of an issue there. It is here.   Most of Mario Kart 64 is presented in 2D, including the characters themselves. They're flat, simple sprites. Two-dimensional drivers in a three-dimensional world, and it's off-putting. Playing a game intended for lower resolutions and decade-old televisions on newer sets with progressive scan is weird, as there's a stark contrast between your racer and the racetrack. The 3D elements look great  crisp and clean, just like Super Mario 64. But the 2D elements stand out, appearing flat, jagged and all-around ugly. It's not a pretty sight.   So it all comes back to fun. Hardware incompatibility will always be an issue when playing older games on newer machines. And graphics will continue to improve going into the future, constantly making what looks great today seem like garbage tomorrow. The one thing that can't be damaged by the tides of time is a truly solid game design, and it's that that Mario Kart 64 still has today. Nintendo's flagship of fun for four is still a blast with friends, its battle mode still a great way to spend time with three of your buddies. If you're a lone gamer, you might want to let this download's technical lackings save you 1000 Wii Points  it's not worth it alone. But with a full force of four, the fun factor redeems the flaws. You won't mind the absence of Ghosts and the pop-ugliness of overpixilation when you're busy dodging shells and popping balloons, and that's what Mario Kart's really all about.  Mario Kart 64 arrived in America almost exactly 10 years ago, and the fans found it immediately. The game was a phenomenal sales success for Nintendo, selling over a million copies in just its first two months on the market, and paving the way for more great multiplayer games (like GoldenEye) to come later that same year. If you never owned an original Kart cartridge, consider this download. But if you've still got the old N64, four dust-covered controllers and the game itself sitting in a closet somewhere, do some digging. This re-release comes close to capturing the full spirit of the original version, but playing it old-school remains superior.", "date": "Jan 30, 2007"}
