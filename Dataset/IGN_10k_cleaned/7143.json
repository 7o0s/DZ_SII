{"name": "Myth 2: Soulblighter", "name_review": "Myth II: Soulblighter", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/25/myth-ii-soulblighter", "text": "Although the initial release of Myth II: Soulblighter took a turn for the worse when it was discovered the uninstall program was a bit *erhmm* buggy, Bungie sucked it up and recalled version 1.0 of its highly anticipated medieval strategy title.  It didn't take the folks at Bungie long to get version 1.1 out the door (complete with a little red sticker indicating that this was the version to have).  As fans of the original, we were happy little freaks when our brand spankin' new copies of Myth II: Soulblighter v1.1 finally arrived at our offices.  Now, after playing it for a while, we can honestly say that Myth II lives up to (and surpasses) all of the hype surrounding this long-awaited title.    Storyline  Myth II takes place about half a century after the end of the Fallen Lords. Soublighter, Balor's second in command during the Great War and the strongest of the remaining Fallen Lords, has returned to enact revenge on the land that banished his former commander.  He's been biding his time, raising armies of undead and enlisting the help of several of the more nefarious races in the land.  Although the past sixty years have been a time of relative peace, the calm is about to be broken by Soulblighter and his evil minions.  Gameplay  Gameplay remains true to the original and is very similar to other strategy games.  You have a number of units you command on the battlefield, each serving different functions.  But unlike most strategy games Myth II focuses entirely on combat and troop utilization.  You don't have to worry about mining resources and you don't have to worry about building units - you start with a set number of troops for each mission and you only have to worry about the battle action. What's better is that your surviving units will carry over into the next mission, attaining veteran status and becoming better at combat in the process.   If you've ever played any RTS game you'll be able to jump right into Myth II without so much as a glance at the manual.  It might be helpful to go over the included command card, but mainly just for reference as to how to control the camera.  For those of you making your first plunge into the RTS market, Bungie has included an informative and humorous tutorial which will get you up and running with Myth II in under thirty minutes.  The narrator in the tutorial reminded me of Charlton Heston from the Budweiser radio commercials a few years back.  You'll just have to try out Myth II to fully understand what I'm talking about, but he's got a very deep voice and he'll let you know when it's time to stop screwing around.  There are twenty-five missions overall, set in a variety of locations throughout the land. You'll duke it out in the countryside, on a huge boat, and even make a castle raid or two.  The camera interface from the original is brought over into Soulblighter so you can quickly adjust the viewing angle with one hand while you direct the battle with your mouse.  Interface  When beginning work on a sequel, the Bungie team poured through emails and newsgroup postings by gamers who had suggestions to offer. According to Bungie, the first thing to improve was the interface. So the interface has been made more accessible with two additions -- the ability to move the camera with the mouse by simply dragging the cursor to the edge of the screen and a new menu bar along the bottom of the screen that offers one-click access to a number of formations and other common commands.  And if you're lucky enough to have a mouse wheel, you can use it to zoom in or zoom out of the action.  Other interface tweaks include the ability to turn your units by clicking and dragging (a yellow arrow appears on the ground indicating possible headings) and the ability to direct highlighted groups across long distances by right-clicking on a location on the map.  Units  Although you'll only be able to play the good forces in the single player campaign, you can opt to take command the army of the undead in multiplayer games.  Here's a rundown of most of the units you'll find in Myth II:   Forces of Light  Berserkers: wild Barbarians who wield two-handed claymores, slicing your enemies better than a Ginsu combine.  Bowmen: you know, guys with bows.  In addition to normal arrows, each bowman carries an explosive fire arrow that is useful for damaging several enemy units at the same time.   Dwarves: little guys who like to blow things up.  They pack a hefty double punch with molotov cocktails and satchel charges.   Journeymen: although they carry no sword, these units are extraordinarily valuable for their healing abilities.  They can also damage undead units with a mere touch.  Mortar Dwarves: if you thought the regular Dwarves were deadly you should see these guys in action.  Their explosive cannon balls mean increased range, increased firepower, and increased danger to your own troops if you don't watch out.  Warriors: the backbone of your army.  Humans in tin cans equipped with swords and shields.   Forces of Dark  Brigands: they serve the same function as Warriors, but they are undisciplined and less effective fighters than their trained counterparts.  Dark Archers: these arrow-notchers are the evil equivalent to Bowmen.   Fetch: evil electricity-slinging priestesses who wear the skin of their fallen foes.   Ghasts: pitiful soulless entities who's touch can stun the living.  Ghols: swift, strong, and dangerous.  These nasty little creatures can pick up items on the battlefield and use them to their advantage.  Mauls: pig-faced and muscle bound.  These guys can take it as well as dish it out.   Thrall: undead warriors who carry axes.  They're slow, but they're usually found en masse making them bothersome foes.  Soulless: flying skeletons armed with javelins.  Stygian Knight: suits of armor animated by Soulblighter himself.  These axe-wielding units cannot be harmed by arrows and are best left to the Dwarves.  Warlocks: evil sorcerers who conjure explosive fireballs.  Wights: made of parts from a variety of dead victims, Wights are vile, disease ridden creatures that are extremely dangerous to the Light forces.  They can be commanded to explode, sending their nauseous, paralyzing bodily fluids flying. Very deadly and very disgusting ... cool.   Graphics  One of  the biggest improvement in Myth II has to be in the game world itself. Everything is richer, more immersive, and realistic than before.  Not in huge leaps and bounds, but with the addition of many small elements like falling leaves and water reflections that combine to make a more impressive whole.  For example there are now fires in the landscapes, full three-dimensional buildings like windmills that slowly turn their blades, castles with gates that raise and lower, and huts that play important roles in line of sight and taking cover.  The level of detail on the mesh terrain that covers the landscape has been increased fourfold, making for more detailed terrain and more realistic looking organic environments.  Hills and cliffs are much steeper, rivers are deeper with swifter currents (watching a line of troops wade across a stream, their reflections bobbing in the river's current is simply spectacular), while torches and fires cast colored light in the landscape.   Sound  If Myth II has a failing (and that's a big if) then it's in the sound department.  Overall, the sound effects, voices, and briefing music is extremely well done.  But Bungie has failed to include a background soundtrack for the actual missions.  What's there is impressive, but it would have been nice to hear some real dramatic music while you're hacking on the undead ... like George Thoroughgood's Bad to the Bone for instance.  Multiplay  Bungie has not tampered much with the networked game, but instead has improved it by adding a few tweaks and new features making it easier to play. For example, for those who quickly fall behind in chat messages, the up arrow key now lets you view the last ten messages, while player and game search parameters on the company's Bungie.Net service should let players get into games much more easily. The designers have added a number of different game types however and up to 16 people will be able to play on the same map.  Game Editors  For those of you more creative types who long to create your own maps to cover with a sticky, bloody sheen, Bungie has included Fear and Loathing with Myth II: Soulblighter.  No, it's not a drug-induced psychosis generator, but rather a set of game editing tools that offers up almost limitless playing possibilities.  Fear is a tag editing program which allows you to tweak such things as sound, weather effects, and unit projectiles.  Loathing is a terrain editor which allows you to construct unique maps. Together these two tools should provide more than enough tweakability for even the most power-hungry user and should help expand and strengthen Myth's hardcore user base, the Internet-based community that has grown up around the game.  Wrap It Up, I'll Take It  I highly recommend this game to anyone, even those who have never played a RTS game before.  Sure, it's very similar to it's predecessor, but Myth was a great game and Myth II breathes enough new life back into this series to qualify as an incredibly fun game with tons of replayability.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Feb 25, 1999"}
