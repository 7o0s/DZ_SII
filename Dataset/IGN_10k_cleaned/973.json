Man remakes hit shooter. Man works on other hit shooter. Man works on really big shooter. Man keeps working on big shooter. Repeat for years. Man finally releases big shooter. Big shooter really isn't all that big. It's been a long ride, but unfortunately this game isn't about Ion Storm's struggles, it's about time-travel and shooting monsters down big hallways, which in the shape of Daikatana is much less interesting than its real-life counterpart.  As Hiro Miyamoto, you're just an average martial arts instructor who gets involved in a mission of time-shattering proportions. You must rescue the girl from the evil corporation, find the sword with the girl, and travel back in time with the sword, the girl and a Superfly to get a vaccine for a virus that has wiped out two-thirds of the world's populace. The sword is the Daikatana, a weapon wielded by your ancestors, and you are... a guy with guns that fires at things a lot. This is a shooter, which means that while there are cutscenes and plotlines happening in the background, most of it is window dressing for miles of action and gallons of blood and flayed flesh.  The game is split up into four time periods, each of which contains a fair number of levels -- so many, in fact, that you'll definitely be ready for the next period when you finish one of the four. When Daikatana was first pitched, it was one of its most major points -- you'll have four sets of weapons to cover everything from future Kyoto to ancient Greece, to the dark ages of Norway and near-future San Francisco. On top of the United Nations of weapons, Romero also promised that this would be the first game to have sidekicks that you'd actively control during gameplay. These wouldn't just be characters to spice up the scenery, they would play an active part in contributing to the gameplay. Well, four years later and everyone's gone that far, taken the boat trip, and waved to Daikatana while sailing into beautiful new waters while it became even more bogged down in production. Rogue Spear, Half-Life, and Soldier of Fortune are but a few of the games to take some of those concepts and run with them into bright new territories.  So let's start, shall we? You couldn't ask for a worse opening to a game. Though it's supposed to be Kyoto, I think you're actually thrown into the island of lost toys, as you'll be spending most of the first time period shooting mechanical ~froginators~ and flying mosquitoes who sound about as convincing as a Woolite commerical. Those of you living in subway terminals may find pleasure in enacting your revenge upon metal rodents and amphibians, but for the rest of us, it's nothing but sheer pain. It's surprising that Ion Storm actually released the game with the opening levels in the state they are, given how high the expectations are for this game. And just when you think that it's going to get better, it doesn't. More mosquitoes, more frogs, and... and alligator or two. By the time you finally reach your first nondescript metal robot, you'll cry with tears of joy. The game does get better, however -- you just have to struggle through about three or four hours of tedium before it does. If you're the type of person who would wade through a half-frozen river in your underwear in order to get the hostess snack cake waiting on the other side, then you shouldn't have any problem pushing yourself through the opening area. A lot of you, however, will simply give up -- and my first guess is that it will be on the piston-style jumping puzzle that brings frustration to new heights. There's nothing shooter fans like more than jumping puzzles, unless the jumping puzzle also kills you if you don't perform it perfectly.  Later levels fare a lot better. The maze-like structure and confusing layout of the levels turn into something a lot more palatable by the time you hit Greece and Norway, but that's when you really get a chance to feel the game out for what it really is, which isn't too much of anything in particular. It's about as charming and inviting as Blood II was a year or so back, and much less of a grabber than Kingpin. Everything that had a chance of making this game original has turned out to be nothing but a disappointment, and any ounce of ingenuity feels more like nostalgia, since most of the ideas that are successful are tied to older titles like Quake and Doom II.    The weapons in the game are badly tuned, to the point of frustration. While most shooters may give you a selection of repetitive or ho-hum bullet-hurlers, Daikatana tries to toss out some new ideas and fails miserably. The Ion Cannon for instance ricochets around corners, which in terms of actual gameplay means that it usually ricochets back from a wall and hits you, causing you a fair amount of damage. The rocket launcher is incredibly slow, and even the shotgun is awkward, firing off six fat shots before taking its time to reload. The crossbows in Norway are just as slow as the rockets, and always fire off much slower than you'd anticipate. The hammer in Greece is simply useless, and the poison snakes suffer from the same problem as the Ion Cannons, usually poisoning you more than the enemy. The C4 is possibly the most frustrating, as it's a grenade that sticks to surfaces -- unfortunately, since the edges aren't as realistic as you'd expect in the game, sometimes trying to launch it at a distant enemy means actually attaching it to a nearby railing, one that you though you were more than clear of. Even the weapons that work are devoid of any fragging satisfaction -- you simply fire at an enemy with little or no animation, and at some point they pop. End of story. I've become so spoiled by damage points and realistic animation that I barely found myself interested in hitting a gigantic Gryphon only to be rewarded with a simple explosion, and no real interaction.  The sidekicks only make matters worse. Superfly Johnson, when not annoying you with his ~Wazzzzzup!~ tends to love standing in your firing line, and Mikiko seems to be moody when it comes to picking up health and weapons when it's obvious she needs them. You can give the characters directions, like Get, Follow or Attack, but most of the time it's better just to keep moving, and keep them behind you -- and pray never to go down elevators, ever. Unlike games like Half-Life, if your sidekick dies the game's over, so if you can imagine trying to get a soldier through an entire level with you, you'll get a glimpse at what sort of pain you'll feel hanging out with the kids in Daikatana.  The graphics themselves are bi-polarity in motion. Sometimes they impress, such as when you peek at some of the large structures in Greece, or the gritty, detailed cement workings of Alcatraz, but at other times they're incredibly dated. The animation of the characters in general is fairly poor, especially in cutscenes when they spin around like robots to speak, or walk in no general connection with the floor below them. Models are definitely much chunkier than recent shooters on the market, and the death animations harken back to Quake, with big bloody explosions for nearly every character, without any real animation or detail. The sound seems pretty secure in its personality, however -- it just plain sucks. The first episode in particular has sound effects lifted off of stock CDs, particularly the annoying buzz of the mosquitoes and the dinner gong clang of the metal enemies when they die. Nothing has a thump, or a bass to it, so when you're attacking enemies your weapons sound consistently feeble, even when you're heaping on damage. The music is of the Quake genre, which means that it's almost nonexistent in the game itself -- it doesn't annoy, however.  Once you've got your head around the spotty weapons and the sidekick problems, then you've got to come to terms with the game itself. Nearly (and by nearly I mean all) the puzzles in the game involve you flipping a switch or finding a key in order to get through a door, only in the Daikatana universe, that key or switch and the door could be miles apart. Plus, the lack of a map feature makes it that much harder to remember where the hell you're supposed to go. Take the AEGIS puzzle for instance, where you spend 40 minutes exploring a gigantic serious of buildings, grabbing a few lettered keys, only to find out that you've got to go back through the entire mansion to find the one last key you need to finish the level. It's about as fun as a series of end-mazes glued together with double sided tape and a copy of Cat Fancy.  The plot sounds interesting but dives into a series of ~get this to get here~ statements, the weapons are a disappointment, the sidekicks are a pain in the ass -- but what about the multiplayer? Multiplayer is probably the game's strongest feature, which means that it's nothing to write home about. The weapons that feel slow or clunky in single player still feel clunky in multiplayer, but the maps are generally a lot tighter and less confusing than their single player counterparts, though some were ludicrously large in size. You're able to play some levels co-operatively as well, which was definitely fun -- two or three heads are better than one when it comes to figuring out where you're supposed to go next. We had problems with bugs throughout our experience though, with my computer crashing around four times during a LAN gaming session, and twice during an Internet session. It was fairly laggy on a server with a good PING, but load times for the levels went quickly.  The bugs don't stop at the multiplayer experience, either. The single player game was filled with graphic glitches and odd crashes, my personal favorite being the ~Z_Free:bad magic~ crash that happened in Greece. Voodoo cards in particular seemed to have problems with the game, though I played most of my game on a TNT2 and had a glitch free experience with it. Bugs or no bugs though, that's the least of this game's worries.  After all that time, all that work, the end product feels like the designers weren't trying to excite or impress us at all. It goes exactly where you'd expect, does what it's supposed to do, and nothing more. More hallways, more doors, and finally a chance to look at more hallways and doors in new environments. I tried to work with the game a bit, but it didn't seem to help either. At that point, I simply gave up, and placed Daikatana on our review shelf next to all the other shooters that have come and gone over the last year or so. At most this game is an average but dated game, and at worst it's a messy, tedious, monotonous attempt to convince gamers that they'd rather have big gibs and no brains rather than something more substantial. Half-Life, Rogue Spear and even Soldier of Fortune have already proved the theory wrong, so it looks as if the debate has already been closed.  -- Vincent Lopez A mediocre PC first-person shooter gets worse with the transition to Nintendo 64. Slow, sometimes sloppy control mixed with boring, uninspired level design, dumb enemies, and sleepy weaponry come together for an entirely average N64 shooter -- one that really isn't good, but at the same time isn't exceptionally poor either. After releasing the game as a rental-only title in August, Kemco and Electro Source have now decided to unleash Daikatana N64 onto unsuspecting retailers and Holiday shoppers alike. It shouldn't have bothered. If you're absolutely dying for another game of this type and can look past the blurry graphics and clunky controls, you could do worse than shelling out $3 at Blockbuster to check it all out for yourself. I certainly don't recommend it. As for buying Daikatana 64 -- save your money, please. There are far better budget titles out there that deserve your hard earned cash more than this mediocre port.", "date": "Jun 2, 2000"}
