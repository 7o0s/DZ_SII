But for those who don't want to spend a million dollars on a new PC, the PlayStation version of Moto Racer will provide the same great fix at a cheaper price.  Graphically, this game doesn't look as good as its 3Dfx enhanced counterpart, but taken strictly on its PlayStation merits, this game looks really good. And when you've got a fast and smooth frame rate to compliment these nice graphics, well, you just can't say a game is bad just because it doesn't look as good as the PC version.  However, the gameplay did have some minor flaws. For example, the driving physics were just a little too sensitive. In fact, I found myself throwing my controller a few times simply because the turning was a little too accurate. This game needs power slides.  But beside my nit-picking, Moto Racer is pure fun. And since there aren't that many motocross titles out there, this one has to be the best one available.  Jay Boor", "date": "Nov 4, 1997"}
