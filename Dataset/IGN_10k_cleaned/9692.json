Now that it's available on the PlayStation Store, many of you who missed out on the game may be interested in downloading it, but the real question is how Spyro holds up nowadays. While not everything about the game sits right with us, Spyro still has a lot going for it and may deserve a look -- if not just for the sake of nostalgia.   Spyro the Dragon is about, as you may have guessed, Spyro the dragon and his quest to free his fellow dragons from magical imprisonment. You see, at the game's beginning, the dragons are thriving both economically and socially while basking in wealth. However, a malicious creature stirs outside of the Dragon Worlds, and that creature is Gnasty Gnorc. Banished to an isolated world a while ago, Gnasty began experimenting with magic and, at the height of his hatred towards the dragons, cast a spell that crystallizes all the dragons into lifeless statues, while simultaneously turning all of the dragon's gems into evil minions. Spyro, however, is the only dragon that avoided the spell (somehow) and must work to save his dragon kin.   Too many spicy foods. The story is somewhat charming, but clearly isn't the highlight of the game, as it essentially takes a backseat to the platforming action that dominates the title. You must guide Spyro through six worlds, each with a handful of different areas, in order to free the dragons, gather gems, and reclaim the stolen dragon eggs. As you can see, the majority of this game is about running around and gathering items and adding them to your overall inventory in order to progress from one world to another. The formula really doesn't change during the game, besides a few minor variations during flight/boss levels.   So how does Spyro deal with all these Gnorcs running around? The little dragon can move about freely in the now very dated 3D environments and can doge roll to either side (this technique seemed much less effective than it should be). Spyro can also glide after a jump, sprint forward in a charge, and breathe fire. Most of the enemies are relatively easy to deal with, either requiring a well-placed head butt or a touch of flame. Considering you only have two attack moves, it really has to be one or the other, which is simple but generally enjoyable.   It's very clear that Spyro is an old game, considering the graphics and the fidelity of the sound, but someone interested in a classic gaming experience shouldn't really be bothered by this -- it's expected, after all. For the most part, Spyro looks good for a PlayStation game and sports rather impressive facial animations for such old technology, as well as voiced characters that speak to Spyro whenever they are rescued. It would have been nice to have these interchanges explore more than just gameplay tips. When they do on occasion, you get a lot of personality out of the freed dragon as well as little Spyro himself, but it seemed like most of the time the dialogue was just trying to help you play. That may have been helpful back in the day, but anyone who's well versed in game mechanics will not need the assistance.   Fly home, Spyro! The real issue is how Spyro controls, because controls are the one element that really counts when returning to such an old title. We are pleased to say that Spyro still works fairly well and, while a little loose, tends to feel responsive enough to keep you connected to the experience. Unfortunately, the camera controls leave quite a bit to be desired. It's certainly not the worst, but having to control the camera with the triggers as opposed to (in the PlayStation 3's case) the right analog stick, you don't get the same amount of precision as modern platformers offer.   Lastly, the game just doesn't vary the gameplay enough. To us, the core mechanics aren't evocative enough to keep you hooked all the way through, so longevity of the experience may be a problem for some. However, there's a ton of stuff to collect, so if you're enticed by this purple fire-breather, you'll have enough to do.Spyro the Dragon hasn't aged perfectly, but it still feels solid and runs well. If you can work past a few of the camera and repetition issues (and the lacking, borderline nonsensical story), you'll have fun with Spyro and perhaps understand why it was considered such a phenomenal title all those years ago. However, with such fantastic platformers on the market today, be weary of the game's rusted mechanics -- they may come as a shock to you after playing today's highly refined games.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
