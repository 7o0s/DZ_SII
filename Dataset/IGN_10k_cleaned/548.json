Rampage 2: Universal Tour is the second take on the series on the Game Boy Color, and while this version is the better of the bunch, it still falls flatter than the humans that tend to get underfoot. Features Six giant creatures (Wolf, Lizard, Gorilla, Mouse, Rhino, Lobster) More than a hundred cities Five bonus rounds Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color   Compared to the console versions, the Game Boy Color rendition of Rampage 2: Universal Tour is pretty much a spot on conversion of what the original design was: a repetitive romp from city to city where you simply climb up buildings and smash the crap out of them, all the while avoiding the swarming defenses of the city dwellers. All of the six creatures in the game (three readily available, three hidden) have a nice array of attacks to go up against the menacing building.  But once you learn how easy it is to take out a building simply by standing on top of one and punching down on the roof, the game's a breeze. And you might be traversing the planet, but if you've destroyed one city you've pretty much seen it all -- all cities look the same, regardless of the buildings given each location.  The Game Boy Color version lacks the needed oomph that a game featuring angry mammoth beasts needs. First of all, these characters are tiny, even for Game Boy standards.  The incredibly detailed animations ported over from the console versions have been shrunk down to a size where you can barely  tell what these creatures are doing. Is he eating a human or simply kicking the side of a building? The game does feature a few sound effects, like a digitized scream of a human being eaten or stomped, but when you bash a building...silence. Even when a skyscraper tumbles down after being beaten to hell and back, there's no real satisfying ~crumbling~ effect.  The action does get repetitive, but the action is occasionally broken up with tiny bonus rounds interspersed between levels. My favorite? See how many humans you can eat or stomp before the time runs out. The game also features a two player mode for anyone with access to an additional Game Boy Color, another copy of the game, and a link cable. A good addition, since the original concept allowed up to three players into the brawl.  I'm not saying the console versions were any good, but at least they have a decent premise. The Game Boy Color game isn't quite as satisfying as the originals, simply because the monsters' sizes aren't protrayed faithfully  how menacing can a giant wolf be if he's only four times bigger than the humans he's eating? Compared to the size of Godzilla in the recently released Godzilla: The Series on the Game Boy Color, these guys are like fleas. Even still, the game is fun for a while, but then it all becomes a pattern  once you've learned the simple trick of destroying buildings quickly, the game loses its enjoyment. It's better than average, but not by much.", "date": "Dec 16, 1999"}
