{"name": "NERF Arena Blast", "name_review": "Nerf Arena Blast", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/17/nerf-arena-blast", "text": "If the pen is mightier than the sword (which, if you're willing to experiment, is true with around 35% of rollerball pens and 27% of ballpoint pens, according to an informal IGNPC survey), then a Nerf missile must be at least twice as fast as a fraggable bullet. Not only did Nerf Arena Blast beat Unreal Tournament and Quake III to the punch, but it delivers a tournament experience that is just as incredible (and in some ways, more original) as everything promised by the two powerhouses. Not only is this game not just for kids, but it's a challenging and exciting shooter rivaling any ~adult~ action game on the market this year.  If you've been reading our previews, you know what a big surprise this game was to us when Stephen brought the game back to the offices and one by one, got us all addicted to it. It's a classic (I suppose we can say that now) first-person shooter done better than most of its competitors, and ups the ante by actually having the Nerf to rethink tournament play, instead of simply taking the existing formula and tagging on the Nerf label.  The game is structured like a giant obstacle course/gameshow, with different arenas providing you with a variety of formats to test your skills. Each arena is then split into three distinct games (Pointblast, Speedblast, and Ballblast), with bonus rounds included for high scores in certain arenas. Like UT, Nerf isn't limited by a plot per se, which means that the arenas are only separated by the designer's imagination -- the Seqouia arena has you jumping through trees and swimming through caverns, while the Orbital arena takes place on a space station, complete with anti-gravity and an airlock. Skycrapers are just around the corner from asteroid battles, and moon-top Nerfing is right next to the standard nerf arena.   The Pointblast gives you a straightforward arena experience, with one major difference -- points. You don't win a level with kills, but by scoring points, which can be gathered by taking out high-ranking competitors, and finding special targets hidden around the level. Though you can usually win by killing everything that walks, crawls, or moves, the smart players will head for the #1 player, who grants a whopping 1,000 points (an average player only give 250). The Speedblast event has you running through mazes and obstacle courses in order to find seven flags before your competitors -- it's short and sweet, but a fun diversion from the tournament fights. The final event (and my favorite) is the Ballblast event, which fills an arena with colored balls, which must be captured, and then shot through special holes in the arena. The problem? There is only one set, which means that all of you are looking at once. Not only do you have to kill to keep your points up, but you must find out who has the balls and eliminate them before they have a chance to score. It's like a styrofoam version of Rollerball, and it hooked me with its gameplay possibilities.   The environments hold their own share of tricks on top of the game rules -- the Sequoia level favors tunnels and bridge structures, which are perfect for gamers looking for hiding places, while the Orbital arena offers crazy low-gravity rooms where jumps will fly you across the air like balloons. The skyscraper arena is full of incredible jumps and hair-raising platforms, which not only test your aiming skills, but your twinkle-toes as well.  You've Got the Look  Because its based on the Unreal engine, you'll see a lot of familiar tricks: the screen whoosh when you re-enter a battle, the beautiful flare off of lights, the smooth character designs... but the art team has simplified the formula. Instead of going for the incredible detail of Unreal, VMI wanted to capture the feeling of stepping into a real gameshow. Instead of vistas you've got neon corridors, and bright targets. Forget the piranhas and monsters -- this is about tagging your competitors, and quickly. Though there are times when the textures feel a little simple (such as the base of the rivers in the Seqouia arena), it really lends to that feeling of a manufactured environment. Weapons are all rendered to look like their real life Nerf counterparts, including the darts, which stick to walls as you fire them, and react like you'd expect them too. Discs ricochet off of any and all surfaces, while the Mighty Mo's ammo bounces along happily until it hits an enemy, then explodes with a pop.  The sound effects also lend themselves to gameshow pings and bings, sounding at times more like a pinball game than a fragfest -- some people may not love the lack of earth-shattering explosions involved with Nerf, but I loved the sounds, especially the announcer, who helped keep score and pace for the game, shouting out updates on who was in first place, and how much time was left on the clock.   Nerfplay  The best thing about Nerf is that after you've adapted to the graphics and feel of the game, the fun factor keeps things continually fresh. The variety of weapons, characters, and arenas makes you feel just like you're involved in a real competition (which, when you start playing real players, is), and constantly challenges your point-scoring skills. The bots are comparable to the Unreal beasties, but not quite as smart, particularly on the average difficulty settings -- then again, the whole point of this shindig is multiplayer mayhem, so long after you've beaten the single player game, the multiplayer experience is sure to satisfy. The arena structure helps to provide a level-based momentum to the single player game by providing you with a variety of experiences, from the straight forward pummeling of the Pointblast to the console-style run and jump fun of the Speedblast to the frustratingly addictive Ballblast (which gets even better in teamplay).  The interface is clear, and fits the feel of the game. Weapons can be designated by rank, which means that if you run out of ammo, you won't be stuck firing your standard Secretshot when you would have much rather been tagging people with your Pulsator. It's a nice feature, and just one of the cool gimmicks that make customizing your game an easy experience. After beating a level, you can check out your scores on the scoreboard, and see what your points totals are. The real champions aren't just the winners -- they're the highest scorers, and once you've beaten all the levels, it gives you an incentive to go back and earn some bragging rights for the highest point totals.  The multiplayer game provides you with all the cushy experiences that you've come to expect in online games -- which means that you're only a few clicks away from an online game in one of the arenas. If you thought Ballblast was competitive against computer players, wait until you butt heads against some of the gamers out there for those balls. It ain't pretty.  But Can I Blast?  Because almost all of the weapons in the game are based on real-life Nerf toys, you'd expect it to limit the game's versatility. Surprisingly enough, the weapons are a nice spread of standard shooter weapons, and ingenious gadgets. Every weapon has an alternate fire, from the standard ~stronger~ version of the shot, to some ingenious creations, such as the Sidewinder, which launches a guidable missile with a camera. Fly it correctly, and anyone it hits instantly dies, but be careful -- you're open to attack while you're busy taking out an unsuspecting enemy. The scattershot takes the Nerf theme to extreme by firing a whole buttload of Nerfs at any enemy, a fantastic sight, especially when they're covered with a spray of bullets as they're trying to take you out. The Ballzooka fires high impact balls, but the alternate fire producs globs of ~gooey~ which keep a player stuck in place for 4-5 seconds. While they can still fire and turn, they're stuck hoping you don't take them out before then can run. I've been on both sides of the ~gooey,~ and I can tell you firsthand -- I love the gooey.  Here's the Beef  All of us here at IGNPC know that it's an uphill battle to convince hardcore shooter fans that Nerf Arena Blast is a worthwhile purchase, but we really feel strongly about the game's merits. We play Quake III, we play Unreal Tournament, and we're saying that Nerf Arena Blast may not be the best (or it may be, depending on the type of game you enjoy), but it's certainly a peer to those titles.  Where Nerf truly succeeds is in its nonstop fun factor, a certain joy that (I'm never going to live this one down, am I?) reminds me of the youth I spent dreaming of being a contestant on Double Dare, or better yet, the often forgotten treasure Funhouse starring that JP/JT/BLT red-haired guy and that giant waterslide.  The secret comes with the game's ability to mimic all the things that make tournament fighting so addictive, and then twisting the whole genre by adding an element that I'm shocked none of us had thought of before: the gameshow. While all tournament games are about winning and losing, the addition of point scores (and how the game hinges on them) are what really make the game such a unique experience. Having to constantly keep track of your point score, and change the way you play to adapt to it makes it a brainier experience, but without sacrificing any of the insanity. It changes how you play your friends, and offers a tangier experience than the blast-n'-blast state of current multiplayer. So, to put it simply, instead of waiting on pins and needles for the formal announcements of Unreal Tournament and Quake III, you should be spending that time launching well placed darts at your opponents heads.   -- Vincent ~Mmmmm...
