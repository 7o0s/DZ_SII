This time, they've enlisted the help of programming legend Steve Cartwright (the dude made Megamania, so bow down) to create a freakishly playable little Olympic-themed game, Fox Sports Track & Field '04.  Features:  Four events: Javelin, Hammer Throw, 110m Hurdles, Long Jump Scoreboard  We've just enjoyed a lengthy bit of play time with Fox Sports Track & Field '04. And as soon as you get to download this game -- which Sorrent says will be very soon -- you'll understand why we say lengthy. This itty-bitty track and field game is obnoxiously addictive, making it one of the better downloads we've played recently.  The secret? Simplicity. There are only four events in Fox Sports Track & Field '04 -- javelin throw, hammer throw, hurdles, and long jump -- but the fiendishly clever way the events are crafted and controlled more than make up for the lack of additional events, like pole vault.  And the secret behind that simplicity? Steve Cartwright. We mentioned in the intro that the man has made magic before -- he was one of Activision's star programmers during the heady Atari 2600 days -- and he's back at it again. His talents are a natural mach for a handset game. The Atari 2600 was no tech workhorse, so developers needed to come up with simple, clever hooks to rope gamers in. Such is the case with cellphone games. Without the guts to pump out stupendous visuals, programmers must rely on the oldest trick in the book: actually making something fun.    Cartwright expertly designed these four events with great control schemes that make them easy to pick up, yet impossible to put down until you are the absolute master of the javelin. This is one of those ~just one... more game~ games.  For example, in hurdles, you must tap the touch pad back to get your runner on the blocks. When the gun fires, press forward to get him moving. As the hurdles approach, pres up and hold it for the duration of your jump. Timing is everything. Since you slow down in the air, you want to make sure you're only off terra firm for the exact amount of time to clear the hurdle. Should you sort the jump, your runner crashes into the hurdle and lets out a Q*Bert-ized curse word.  Our faves, though, were hammer throw and javelin. Javelin is controller by pressing forward on the pad to get the runner moving. As you near the end of the run, hold up to rear back. Release the pad to let it fly. Naturally, you slow down as you prep the throw, so you want to time it just right -- just before the end of the run, so you get maximum power without going over the line but without shortchanging yourself any distance on the run.  Visually, the game is slightly above par for a Fox Sports title. Looking better than Fox Sports Football, the colors and sprites are crisp and vibrant. The little runner has real definition -- he looks like a real dude, far more so than the old Activision Decathlon fella. There is some minor audio in the game to go along with the actions, such as the landing up the hammer.I praise Steve Cartwright, not just for his history, but because he is using it to craft better games today. So many programmers get caught up in conjuring false ~oh wow~ moments that they forget to make things fun. And the most fun is often had by simple hooks, such as Fox Sports Track & Field '04's ultra-fun control coupled with smartly timed events. (Cartwright knows a thing or two about crafting games based on timing -- there was a rhythm in Megamania that one you go into, those stinkin' dice and bow ties never have a chance.) One of Sorrent's better releases of late. I can hardly wait to see what Cartwright is working on next for them. But at least I have something to help me pass the time.", "date": "Feb 24, 2004"}
