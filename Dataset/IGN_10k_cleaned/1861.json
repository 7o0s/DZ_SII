See, recently I've been having a little fun with Army Men. I mentioned once that I would try to avoid following the current fashion in Army Men reviews, which involves trying to come up with the cleverest possible trashing of the latest 3DO masterpiece, but the temptation proved too great, and I succumbed. I think I actually did a pretty decent job with the Army Men: World War - Final Front review (the one where I analyzed the franchise as veiled racist demagoguery). Like I say, fun.   But that only works if you've got a lot of time on your hands (or if you're Sam Bishop, who seems able to effortlessly turn out witty anti-Army Men screeds of remarkable length when he feels the motivation to do so), and I don't. I'm going to Tokyo on a suicide mission in two days, and I still have to write a couple of thousand words on why PS2 Quake is a wretched abortion. And for goodness' sake, I already reviewed this stupid game (this stupid game being Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2) months ago, when it came out for the original PlayStation. 3DO, why do you torment me so?   Presentation  Sarge's Heroes 2 has a story, naturally, but the world design is so haphazard, and the characters so dull, that I can hardly bring myself to care. It doesn't help that the new characters include deadly Blue spy Brigitte Bleu, a badly-rendered CG woman with giant breasts (now displayed with super-sharp MPEG2 clarity! Wee-hoo!). Yes. This is what is needed to enhance my enjoyment of a below-average game - badly-rendered CG women with giant breasts. I love having my intelligence insulted.   There are a lot of FMV sequences in Sarge's Heroes, one in every intermission it seems, and far more of them star the badly-rendered CG woman with the giant breasts than I find even vaguely tasteful. It's a bad situation when you're actually relieved by scenes with the chirpy Vikki, the mincing General Plastro, and the grab-bag of cliches that make up Sarge's crew, because it means Brigitte has gotten the hell off the screen.    Gameplay  Sarge's Heroes 2, to be fair, seems to have implemented a number of improvements that make it a better-controlling game than the original Sarge's Heroes. The camera swings around responsively enough (it does the old vertiginous shimmy on occasion, but not too often), textures usually go transparent to stop you disappearing behind walls (although you'll still frequently get a screen full of low-res pixels when the camera chooses to do so), and things like the auto-aim and auto-circle-strafe functions allow you to knock off the tan bad guys with reasonable ease.   Too much ease sometimes, though. Killing the enemies isn't much of a challenge, and killing bosses is a joke, requiring just a couple of flamethrower blasts or bazooka rockets - special weapons like that get ridiculously powerful at times. On occasion, the boss enemies don't even seem to shoot back very effectively - the basic tan soldiers have much smarter average AI, although they also have their quirks, like deciding to get down and do the GI crawl off to your left when you're six feet away from them. Cheap deaths can be paradoxically common, though, especially in areas designed to be negotiated through trial and error. Whoops, a spider falls on my head and kills me there - better not go there again. Dang, I go around that corner and a guy flamethrows me to death in three-quarters of a second - I'll remember that next time.   The game's mission design provides the occasional diversion from basic running and shooting, like escort sub-missions and rescues, and you'll always have to find keys and open doors, but the vast majority of the action still boils down to killing everything that's tan and mobile. This is 3D action-adventure at its most generic. It doesn't help that the PS2 version seems to be suffering from some weird bugs in its control and level scripting.  At times, it will randomly ignore the completion of level objectives, forcing you to thrash about doing whatever you can think to do in order to make the mission progress. On one occasion, the camera started panning around Sarge with a life of its own, causing me to run over the edge of a cliff. Bugs like that just aren't acceptable in a console game.    Four-player deathmatch is included to stretch things out a bit, and to be fair the selection of options and levels is pretty impressive, but, well, it's still Army Men. Third-person DM is a suspect concept to begin with in my mind, and all the control caveats of the single-player game apply.   Graphics  The PS2 version still doesn't have a constant framerate.   It works well enough most of the time, but it definitely fluctuates in situations with multiple enemies, turns around corners, and significant graphical effects. Speaking of effects, they are the most substantial addition to the new version's graphics. Some of the area objects and characters have had more polygons added, but they still animate the same, so the main difference is the addition of new lighting effects, new highlighting on characters (making them look even more plastic than before, which I suppose is an improvement), and a goofy motion blur that accompanies explosions.   The game still doesn't look all that great, is the long and the short of it. Whatever hand guided the aesthetic design of this game was, as before, wobbling wildly back and forth. I'm still not sure how the Army Men world is put together. There are Micro-Machines-esque real worlds that the Army Men wander about, dwarfed by the specimens of human civilization; then there are ordinary battlefields; then we're all of a sudden wandering around graveyards and haunted castles shooting zombies and giant spiders. Why? Oh, well -- at least the game has a sky now.   Sound  For some reason, Sarge's Heroes includes a soundtrack that mixes generic hard rock with typical orchestral B-grade war movie themes. I'd rather they just stick to the Hogan's Heroes tunes, given that they're a nice change from what you usually hear in games - goodness knows I hear enough generic hard rock most days. The voice acting and effects are, respectively, par for the Saturday-morning cartoon and action videogame courses, which actually puts the game a cut above some other games in the voice department. Sarge does declare himself ~good to go~ with a certain amount of elan.Man, I got this brutal feeling of dj vu coming on.  It's like I just wrote the same review all over again.Makes sense, though, considering I just played the same game all over again.  Why SCEA would spike a perfectly good fighter like Bloody Roar 3 and then approve a cheapo port like this one I have no idea.  Trip's been in the industry a long time, maybe has some really embarassing pictures of Phil Harrison or something, I don't know.Anyway, if this is the direction the franchise is going to continue to take, Army Men gets no love from me.  You're on a brand-new system, guys.  Make something new.", "date": "Mar 27, 2001"}
