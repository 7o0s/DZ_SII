Three times with three different development teams is absolute proof that the company's arcade football game just can't be done on the Nintendo handheld. At all. Don't even try it anymore. Let it die, or at the very least, move it the Game Boy Advance. Blitz should be sacked on the 8-bit system. Features Multiple camera angles  Digitized speech and video  Password system for Season Mode  Updated rosters  Only for Game Boy Color    We're all familiar with Blitz, at least in the arcade or on the consoles. This game represents the testosterone of football  fast action, high-scoring games, brutal hits, and just down-and-out field violence. The sport has been reduced to seven-on-seven teams, and 30-yard first-down attempts  and it works, at least in the arcade and on the consoles.  Digital Eclipse was smart  after two tries at the Blitz series, the development company turned down the third iteration. Majesco's internal studio Morning Star Multimedia picked up the ball that Digital Eclipse dropped and made its own plays. What did we get? A different, but equally crappy portable version of an awesome game design. There must be something in the Game Boy Color hardware documents that says ~Hardware limitations: no more than 52 colors on-screen, no more than 10 sprites per line, and no Blitz games.~  To its credit, Morning Star got the presentation of Blitz right in the Game Boy Color version  transitions zip from one scene to the next with intense energy, and there's tons of digitized voice when it counts (~TOUCHDOWN!~ ~INTERCEPTED!~ ~QUARTERBACK SACK!~), and short videoclips play when an excellent play happens (like a touchdown, interception, or quarterback sack). But out-of-game fluff is where the game excels  the quality takes a dive everywhere else.  Control is somewhat tight, but the development team didn't really work the actual Blitz control scheme into the game  instead, offering something clunkier and less intuitive, especially for fans coming from the arcade and console versions of the game series. There's no spin moves, no leaps to avoid tackles  oh, there's a stiff-arm move, but good luck putting it to use or actually succeeding in gaining a few yards.   Computer AI in this game is just terrible  Blitz was, and always will be a high-scoring game of football. It's its nature  a game's more exciting when there are plenty of scoring opportunities. But in Blitz, it's like soccer  you'll spend more time getting sacked, or getting the ball swatted, or getting tackled for a short yardage so often you'll wonder if it's at all possible to score a touchdown. It's the same for the computer opponent (this is only a one-player game, by the way)  the computer controlled quarterback will continuously shotgun the ball and hold it, inviting a sack more than 75% of the time.  And then, there's the loosey-goosey collision detection. You'll be running way ahead of the defense, when wham! You're ~tackled~ with no animation and the defensemen a good one-and-a-half sprite distance away. Same thing with interceptions and pass incompletions  they're simply assumed. You'll never see these represented by sprite animation...you'll just hear and see the play called.  Stick a fork in it  Blitz is done on the Game Boy Color. Three separate instances of lame gameplay is enough evidence that the game just doesn't work as an 8-bit portable title, and if I see this game again on the GBC it's just indicative of Midway's hunger for money out-balancing its need for quality handheld gaming. I'm sure Blitz can be done on the Game Boy Advance, so let's give that a try...and let the Game Boy Color series just fade away.", "date": "Sep 23, 2000"}
