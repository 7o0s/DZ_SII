Flying in the face of Gran Turismo's beneath-the-bonnet tinkering and the over-the-top mud bath that is MotorStorm, this latest installment of Namco's arcade racing series is high-speed rubber-burning at its purest and most simple. In fact, cosmetic details aside, playing it is more like stepping back in time rather than embracing the next generation and there isn't a great deal to separate Ridge Racer 7 from the original game that ushered in the PlayStation back in 1995.   Build your boost up by drifting, then hit it on the straights.  Thing is, Ridge purists wouldn't want it any other way and, after playing ever-more complex racers swamped with unnecessary options and modes, playing something that's so straightforward, so - dare we say it - old school, actually makes for a refreshing change.   That's not to say Ridge Racer 7 doesn't offer anything new. Take the Ridge State Grand Prix for example. It's a fleshed-out career mode that serves as the main event in the game, a sprawling racing season where players start out with well, nothing, not even a car. Before you can make a name for yourself out on the circuit you have to earn the right to compete with the best, by driving in a trial race. Win - which, to be honest, is a complete breeze - and you're awarded a car and are free to steer your racing career in any direction you wish.   There are three main types of race: Ridge State Grand Prix, for which you're awarded fame points that can be spent on customising your car. Win a manufacturer trial and you get a brand new car to add to your garage, plus they'll offer new parts that can be bolted onto existing motors. And finally there's the UFRA single events, which are a series of one-off races with restricted rules, whether it's limiting the type of car you can race or the amount of nitro you can use out on the track. However, no matter what type of challenge you plump for the end result is essentially the same - a frantic race for first place, only around a different circuit with a different prize at the end.   Although some of the tracks look great, others are forgettable.  Out on the track, Ridge Racer's trademark powerslide handling is in full effect right from the start. If you don't go round corners sideways you're not playing the game properly, which can be a bit disconcerting if you're new to the series.   However, it only takes a couple of races to get used to the subtleties of the handling - turn early into the corner, lift off the accelerator for a split-second and then it's hard back on the gas to send your backend sliding out. Chances are you'll over-steer and end up fishtailing out of the corner the first couple of times, but Namco has done a great job in getting the balance of the powerslides just right so every long drift, even around the tightest hairpin, feels controlled and precise. What's more, learn to slide properly and you never have to use the brake, which is something of a revolution in an age where realism often rules over having fun.     The more you drift the more boost you build up, which is key to winning races, especially later in the game. You see, these bursts of speed are less frequently available (at least initially) than they are in, say, MotorStorm, so you have to be careful when you use them. However - and here's the clever part - because you dictate how much boost you earn, by sliding around every corner to fill your three nitro bars, with practice it's possible keep your turbo almost always topped up. Admittedly you have to be a demon driver to keep the boost maxed out, but you'll get a real sense of satisfaction once you've mastered how to do it. It's a nice touch that adds a subtle layer of depth to what is really quite a straightforward racer.   If it is a no-frills race you're after, however, skip the Grand Prix mode and take the Arcade game for a test drive. Here you're free to race around each of the tracks (in normal and mirror mode of course) in a handful of different cars, from starter vehicles that crawl along at a snail's pace, to souped-up sports cars that really demonstrate what Ridge Racer 7 does best - speed.   Progress through the early races and you get to drive REALLY fast cars.  Indeed, this is the fastest racer on PS3, probably any console in fact, and it zips along at an eye-watering 60 frames-per-second, even when the track is cluttered with other cars. It's smooth too, the cars gliding over the track as if it were silk. But then Ridge Racer 7 is hardly the most visually spectacular game we've seen, so it should be quick. In fact we'd go as far as to say it's devoid of any of the fine detailing that makes MotorStorm so memorable, and the lighting - or rather the lack of it - falls way short of the realistic sun-kissed circuits in F1.   There's no denying the cars look great and some of the tracks are masterclasses in how to create the ultimate thrill ride, but there aren't enough of these stand-out circuits. Too many are by-the-numbers and when you're wading through the Grand Prix, one race can easily blur into the next.   The drift handling in Ridge Racer 7 is spot on.  Of course, Ridge fans won't mind because RR7 captures the essence of the series - the speed and the perfectly balanced handling - spot on. But for anyone who wants something more from a racing game - or perhaps just wants to show off how powerful their shiny new PS3 is - Ridge Racer 7 is some way off the mark.If youre a Ridge Racer fan theres no denying youll love its debut on PS3, but for everything the game gets right you cant help but feel its a bit of a missed opportunity. Rather than heralding the arrival of Sonys next-gen machine by pushing the boat out and creating something really rather special, Namco has taken Ridge Racer 6 as a foundation and tweaked it into a new game  so much so that if you own already RR6 on Xbox 360 theres little else here to warrant a purchase.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
