GBA gamers were eager for a brawler that throws down hard and furious like the old-school wrestling games used to while taking advantage of the power of GBA and the new innovations of poly grapplers for a real wrestlefest. Wrestling fans were hoping for portable mayhem that puts on a fireball of a show every time the power comes, just like the WWF does nightly.  Instead, we all just get this: a rehash of the GBC game, which hardly had any heat for the 8-bit sluggo -- the same game that got canned for not measuring up last year.   What?  Never mind, and never mind the game. Instead, in the hopes that THQ knows full well they have pantload in the place where they could have a finely-chiseled piece of Grade-A booty, I'm not going to review the game in this review. Let's just move on. The feature list can stay - it could grow in the future, but this isn't a bad starting place. Otherwise, here's what has to happen next time THQ steps foot, with hopefully a whole new game, inside the arena of the WWF...  Features  24 wrestling superstars Season Mode, PPV and five other play modes with five match types Multiplayer Link Play for up to four players   The first thing THQ has got to do is drop the hard cut -- Natsume doesn't belong in the squared circle. Their wrestling engine doesn't do either technical wrestling or button mashing well (it's pretty sad when a gamer isn't even having fun button-mashing.) There are a lot of other talented, dedicated, hardcore, even hungry developers out there who would sweat like a sieve to bring real WWF attitude to handheld gamers. Give new blood a bump.  THQ has got experience bringing in different wrestling game styles -- the three console games (Smackdown, Raw, and Wrestlemania) all do pretty well with totally separate approaches. There's room to explore in the 2D world as well. The bottom line for a real GBA effort will be this: figure out exactly what works with the system's limits and features. Firepro on GBA worked well with the limits of sprites and simple backgrounds. The makers came to a good compromise of its traditional, very rigid, technical button-timing approach to deal with a relatively awkward angle and heavy animation style that slowed down play. I'd rather see a faster and freakier approach like oldies such as WrestleWar or Nintendo's ancient Pro Wrestling ... anything but the stiff, slogging WWF Road To Wrestlemania. This game is just lost -- there's no Acclaim combos, no Technos button-mashing, no Spike master timing, and no Capcom action precision in the grapples. You simply tie-up and hope that the math in the computer comes up with your numbers off of the stamina bar so that you can throw a slam. Too passive - wrestling gamers want to feel it.  The obvious blunders that this game scrubs pretty clearly need to be gone next time -- kicks and grapples can't pass through characters just because they're too close for collision detection, off-the-turnbuckle moves should flashy and high-flying instead of floaty and goofy-looking, and back-grapples (which are usually part of a strategic surprise attack that the player has to work for to lock in) should not hurt the attacker more often than the stunned opponent. Let's wipe out the GBC visual effort at the same time. This is the bare minimum of what the GBA can do -- no special effects, similar-looking arenas (with no falls-anywhere bouts to jazz it up), and limited animation. Yes, there's a lot of characters in there filling up the game, but three frames of animation on the Rock Bottom doesn't cut it. With the simple, tiny sprites used for these Superstars, we can't even see the fight in their faces.   At the very least, make the fans go crazy. Heck, it doesn't even need to be a great game -- it'd be nice if it was, but it's not like bad wrestling games haven't become classics. Even the flawed GBC brawler WWF Betrayal was adventurous and goofy fun to knock through once. Just pay some fan service -- there's so much to learn about that from where Road to Wrestlemania goes wrong. Here, every wrestler is exactly the same -- the only difference is in their stamina gauge. Big guys are hardly bigger, speedy guys get raced around by hulks, flashy guys don't get the crowd to pop, and powerful guys get too tired to slam. Nobody even has their own repertoire of moves -- except for the Finisher, the move set is nearly the same across the field. If worse comes to worse, just use what the WWF does well - put on a show - and dress up this gaming jobber. The best thing about Road To Wrestlemania is its intros -- as the TitanTron flashes images from the wrestler's entrance clip, the mostly true-to-WWF theme music comes across with all the trademark flair (you even get The Rock shouting ~If you smell...~) So, if the grappling isn't good, bump the season mode. Don't have just one line of text for any given sequence. Give each character his own story through the season, or throw in some event angles to change up alliances. You've already got the stills of the superstars shouting at each other, so how much harder could it be to script a few lines for them to throw at each other instead of just generically saying every time, ~I'll pound you at the next Cage Match!~ Gimme a ~Quoth the Raven~ or ~Survive ... If you can,~ or just throw in a ~Woo!~ and give us all a thrill. Like in the WWF, the show needs to be sold.  Oh, just one more thing. The Password system? FIX IT! I'm not of those nags that insists every game packs a battery - although yes, it's a pain in the rear without it, and yes, it's cheap as hell that a game as huge as a WWF release pinches pennies on a battery. But at the very least, figure out a password system that works for the pick-up-and-play style of handheld gaming. In this game, you have to play a full four bouts (5-15 minutes apiece) before the game doles out a save point. Oh, hell no!The WWF franchise is simply too big for just THIS again. WWF Road to Wrestlemania was one of the top-selling games on GBA and I'm really hoping that THQ uses those figures to convince themselves that they need to treat the next GBA effort more seriously. Is it wrong to hold a WWF title up to a higher standard just because it makes money? Maybe, but for the millions and millions of WWF fans out there, there's no reason why the Game Boy Advance -- far and away the world's favorite and most popular game system -- shouldn't see the same quality and effort explode out of a WWF game as on Xbox, PS2, or Gamecube. Road to Wrestlemania is running down that bumpy road on flat tires and a piddling engine. Next time, GBA shouldn't be left out on the road - it needs to get into the show.", "date": "Jan 25, 2002"}
