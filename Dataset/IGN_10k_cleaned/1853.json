Aside from the fact that they're a veiled parable of unceasing race war?  They have nice FMV.  I mean, this isn't ground-breaking FMV, nobody at 3DO is going to go to SIGGRAPH and win any awards or anything like that, but it's reasonably accomplished as far as modeling is concerned, it's well-directed, and as Saturday-morning-cartoon stuff goes it has pretty darn good voice acting.  From Air Attack to Sarge's Heroes to the newly-minted Green Rogue, the Army Men series has a tradition of nice FMV.   Eventully, though, the opening movie ends, the game begins, and the quality takes what Bill Hicks called ~a real big @#$%in' dropoff.~  This also applies to the newly-minted Green Rogue. 3DO has taken what seemed to be a no-brainer project -- a 2D/3D straight-up shooter in the Army Men universe -- and blown a formula that SNK perfected in Ikari Warriors almost 15 years ago. Green Rogue looks decent, but it suffers from some crucial failings of gameplay.   Gameplay  Green Rogue is a railed, forced-progression, land-based 3D shooter.  To put it another way, the Omega Soldier walks forward, the tan soldiers walk the other way, Omega shoots them, and they shoot him.   This all takes place in a 3D world, though, which allows 3DO to throw some wrinkles into the Commando/Mercs/Ikari Warriors/[insert favorite shooter here] formula, just as Rage Software did when they made the genre 3D with Expendable. Unfortunately, Expendable captured much of what was great about this sort of game, resulting in something that, while shallow, was quite pretty and entertaining. Green Rogue tries to mess with the formula in various strange ways, and never to positive effect.   The main problem with Green Rogue was immediately obvious to me the first time I played it. From my initial impressions: ~Expendable ran like an addict on a mad dash for his next fix, blazing through areas filled with impressive graphical effects. Green Rogue is the same junkie after mainlining a dose of strychnine-cut Mafia smack, right about when the rigor is setting in. It's very, very slow, and for no immediately evident reason.~   Now that the game is finished, it's still very, very slow, and the reason why is still shrouded in mystery. Everything in Green Rogue is slow. Omega Soldier is slow.  The Tan soldiers are slow. Their bullets are slow. Their grenades are slow. The flamethrower is slow because it's supposed to be slow, but everything else is just plain inexplicably slow. Every projectile you fire is so slow as to make leading your targets almost impossible. The grenade-launcher weapon is so slow as to be worth absolutely sod-all, which means you'll curse your luck when you roll over one of the rotating powerups and see it turn into the GL at the last split-second. The only pliable reason to create such a slow-moving game is to possibly open up some time for Omega to avoid enemy fire, but even then the snail's pace is dislikeable at best.   The level construction leads to other, subtler issues of bollixed weapon implementation. The level designers have decided to have some fun with the 3D world, implementing camera shifts that accompany curves in the level, as well as changes in elevation. Nobly-intentioned, these lead to spots of severe frustration.  While Omega Soldier faces forward by default, you can change his facing through 360 degrees with the right analog stick. However, this aspect of the control is very imprecise -- Omega's constant forward movement means you have to continuously correct your different facing in light of the continuous rearrangement of what ~forward~ is, and the sensitivity on the right analog stick isn't set properly for precise aiming. Changes in elevation are a major problem as well.  When you're headed up a hill, Omega's inability to vary his aim on the y-axis (save with a crouch command whose usefulness is extremely limited) means his range is effectively limited to about three feet in front of him.  Beyond that, his shots go straight into the ground.  Related areas where enemies are situated above or below the line of fire abound, making it difficult or impossible to strike back against plinking soldiers.   Graphics  In most aspects, Green Rogue brings the Army Men graphical standard forward a generation. The engine is solid enough to run at a constant framerate for a change, and some of the textures look pretty nice, but the environments and characters, while smooth, aren't particularly detailed or interactive (save for the odd exploding barrel), and the character animation is uninteresting. The Tan soldiers die amusingly, but they don't do much else of note (perhaps appropriately, though, since they weren't put in the game to do anything aside from dying), and some of the boss encounters are ridiculously uninspiring. A submarine enemy looks like a cheaply-rendered gray shark, with no moving parts save two turrets and a door. It just sits there, shooting at you. There were cooler bosses in 8-bit Gyruss.   There are some interesting effects here and there, like fire from flamethrowers and incendiary grenades, but other weapons fire is terribly dull, and the lighting effects aren't implemented with a great deal of skill. Objects just wink on and off within a certain radius of events that cast light (like gunfire), and the effect occasionally looks very cheap, as when a log flashes with light that doesn't illuminate the ground around it.   Sound  Green Rogue is an interesting mixed bag when it comes to music. Half of it is standard-issue Army Men war-movie stuff, which is kind of fun in an Army Men sort of way.  The rest of it is some kind of iniquitous attempt to recreate classic Japanese 16-bit shooter music with an Army Men filter and 32-bit fidelity, which is really awful, the worst nightmares of amateur DJs made digital flesh.   Let me see if I can dig myself out of the fustian pit here... well, the voice acting is pretty good, when you take into account that the lead characters are the emotionless Omega Soldier and his similarly emotionless AI guide. The Tan soldiers shout typical Tan commands and scream typically amusing Tan screams of death, while the usually pleasant variety of gunfire and explosions goes bang and boom around him.You can tell my enthusiasm is dying, can't you?I mean, c'mon.  It's Army Men.  Somehow, regardless of genre, the franchise manages to wither whatever it touches.  Expendable proved that the 2D shooter is almost impossible to screw up completely -- that game was silly, derivative, had almost nothing original going for it save for cool 3D-accelerated graphics, and yet it still managed to be fun in its brainless sort of way.  Green Rogue is equally brainless, but they threw out all the fun along with the grey matter.Air Attack, as per usual, is the only light among the Army Men games that manages to shine with any kind of quality execution.  Unfortunately, now Green Rogue is here, to join its other fellows in trying to drown that one light out.", "date": "Mar 20, 2001"}
