Having a late jump thanks to the death of the Dreamcast, 2K2 couldn't be anything more than a rushed port.  A solid game for sure, but one that perhaps didn't get to fully utilize the power of the newer consoles.  That's not the case as we head into the new NBA season with NBA 2K3.  This is the first Visual Concepts basketball game specifically made for next-gen consoles.    Having been top b-ball dog for the past few years, VC could have sat on their duffs and just updated the rosters.  Instead, they worked to make the game even more realistic with several new moves, a beefed up Franchise Mode, and full use of their newly acquired ESPN-style presentation.  Though Sega's baller still has some nagging problems, it's certainly improved over last season's version.  Features  Detailed players and stadiums modeled meticulously after their real-life counterparts Specular highlighting -- players get sweaty as the game progresses Deep Franchise Mode includes coaches who can help teach players new skills, detailed scouting of college prospects, and the NBA draft in a virtual auditorium Import players from NCAA College Basketball 2K3   Gameplay The problem with looking at basketball games is that many of them are trying for different things. The other hoops games coming out this year are all geared towards a more loose, arcade experience.  And there's nothing wrong with that, because it can certainly be a good experience.  However, NBA 2K3, as with all Sega Sports games, looks to bring realistic gameplay to the table.  So, when it's examined and judged, we may be a bit more critical, because Visual Concepts is trying to make the best simulation possible.  A sim can often have more nagging issues than its more arcadey counterpart.  With that said, we delve into NBA 2K3, a game that had some problems last year in terms of offering a realistic experience.  We won't leave you in suspense -- many of those issues have been resolved and 2K3 is definitely on the right track to sim supremacy.  Last Year's Problems Shot percentage -- NBA 2K2's biggest issue was the ridiculously high shot percentage by the computer AI. It wasn't uncommon for the computer to shoot 70% from the floor, which for a sim game is terribly inaccurate.  In the NBA, shooting 60% is outstanding, and maintaining that average is phenomenal.  Solved: Having played scores of games with NBA 2K3, we can assure you this is no longer a problem.  Though teams may shoot a bit higher percentage than normal, it's rarely beyond the 50s and you will even see percentages in the 40s and, yes, even the 30s. Best of all, NBA 2K3 now has sliders, which allow you to adjust a slew of game attributes so the game plays the way you want it to.  Goaltending -- Way too often you'd get incorrect goaltending calls. Sometimes the ball would be well off the rim and you'd get tagged. There were easily a half-dozen, if not more, goaltending calls each game.  Solved: This was solved in two ways.  First, the rim has more realistic physics so the ball will react to the rim properly and the game will actually interpret where the ball is in relation to the rim. And, now there is a no goaltending animation where often a defensive player jumps up aggressively but pulls his hands back rather than grab the ball and get called for goaltending.  You will still see one or two goal tends a game, but nothing as gross as 2K2.  Trouble under the basket -- Sometimes you'd go for a shot but your angle was weird and you'd shoot underneath the backboard, causing the ball to bounce out of bounds.  Solved: There are new animations and a more solid offensive AI around the basket.  Basically, if you are at an odd position, one where you would obviously be shooting under the rim or backboard, the player will take a step out to make a more clear shot.  This doesn't mean the shot will fall, but we've yet to see a player shooting some of those terrible shots against the wrong end of the backboard.   New Additions Along with these fixes, Visual Concepts has added several new things to the game to improve on last season's solid title.  Not all of these additions, however, are implemented in the fullest, making them kind of cool to have but not really as effective as intended.  Among the most notable new moves is the ability to dive after loose balls.  Anytime the ball is loose and headed out of bounds, you can press jump and your player will dive and try and swat the ball to keep it inbounds.  This looks incredibly cool, but is unfortunately not all that when it comes to gameplay.  There really aren't that many times in the game where a ball is loose and headed out of bounds, and even then you have to have someone close by to dive for it.  More often than not it won't be you, but one of the computer controlled players (on your side or the opposing side) diving after a loose ball.  The real let down is that you can't dive for loose balls not going out of bounds.  In other words, if the Diesel swats away an Iverson layup and it's bouncing towards halfcourt, you can't dive at it and try to nab it.  In fact, if you do try, you'll just jump straight up, which makes your player the laughing stock of the entire league.  It's a good idea, but one that needs to be there in all facets of gameplay to be truly worthwhile.  Another nice one is the double crossover.  When Kobe takes it to the lane, pulls off some sweet crossover and blows past a defender, he would have been screwed in 2K2 if a second defender stepped out to clog the lane.  But now you can get better flow in the game by quickly pressing the crossover button again.  This way you can adjust and blow by the secondary defender as well.  This is great for anybody who loves driving the lane (and that's really what you'll end up doing most games anyway).  The post game has seen some tweaks, particularly with fighting for position.  Last season you really couldn't contest for position in a proper manner, but now when two players back each other down, you can push up and down on the analogue stick to try and move ahead or get behind the other player.  If you're playing offense away from the ball, you can try and get behind the defender for an easier path to the basket and a defender can choose to keep the opponent away from the basket or try and position himself in front to steal an incoming pass.  This adds dimension to a post game that was already solid last year.    Additionally, there are now new types of passes including chest-high and bounce passes.  These are accomplished by tapping or holding on the pass button.  The one thing you have to know (and how would you know to do this) is to go into the menu system and turn on maximum passing. This is often a great way to get the ball around, but other times it seems you do the wrong type of pass.   There's a problem with the passing game at times. When trying to run the fast break, often you will pass the ball up the court and the baller you're passing to will stop in his tracks to catch the pass.  This is exactly what you don't want. There's a very tenuous balance based on pressure. Sometimes you need to tap the pass button to lob the ball and keep your man moving, other times you need a bullet, and sometimes it just doesn't seem to matter.  Over time, after many games, you will learn to adjust properly and pulling off long passes will become possible.  But it's likely going to frustrate initially.  The best of the additions and the best implements is the ability to change your shot midair.  This only goes for layups and dunks, but it's a great way to avoid a block.  When you go up for a dunk or layup and you see a defender closing, press the shot button again and you'll alter your shot to try and avoid the block.  You're more likely to miss a shot when you do this, but then again, if you don't it could be swatted back in your face.  And that would shame you.  Added also is the ability to do advanced pivot moves.  These can be done with a live or dead dribble and the moves change depending on that fact. You can jab step, hold the ball away from the defender, or swing it side to side.  This is a great taunt, but also a good way to get spacing for a shot or to blow past your defender.  The problem is, the ball is very, very vulnerable in this situation.  And as such you will have it stolen more often than not.  And what's really annoying is that when it's stolen, you always enter the same animation of spinning around, looking confused.  This gives your opponent an extra step on you and no chance to recover. This is unfair and worse yet, adjusting the sliders cannot stop this from happening.  A cool idea, but one ruined by making it far too easy pickings for the defense.  The weird thing about these new moves is that anyone who's played previous versions in the 2K series may not fully use and enjoy these new features.  That's because NBA 2K3 plays very much like the previous iterations and it's very, very easy to fall into your old gameplay patterns. You can certainly play the game without using these new features, but somehow the game will feel less than last year this way.  Once you begin utilizing the double crossover, shot changes, and bounced passes, you'll open up the game a lot.  The trick is teaching yourself to use them regularly.   Control Anyone who's played previous versions will have no trouble picking things up.  The controls are similar to last year, though a new pivot move has been added and you can now pass with the C-stick (as seen in Nintendo's NBA Courtside 2002.  Everything feels good and it's a breeze to pull off any of the moves; crossovers, shots, backing defenders down, and going to the hole are simple to manage.    Where you may have trouble, especially if you're new to the series, is the flow of the game. As a video game, it seems like it should be a quick game filled with endless drives to the hole. But as noted earlier, this is a simulation game and as such it's not always easy to make endless dunks (except in rookie mode). You need to actually play the game the way it's supposed to be played, by passing the ball around and trying to find holes in the defense.  This year in particular, it's vital to get open shots.    It's much harder to hit shots with defenders in your face, part of what makes the shot percentages more down-to-earth than in the past. That doesn't mean open shots automatically go or that crazy leaners don't fall, but it's much more likely you'll nail the open jumper than one with Shaq up in your face.  NBA 2K3 can be an exercise in both love and frustration.  You could spend the whole winter playing a decade of basketball with the game. However, due to the faithful attempt to simulate the real-life sport, there are a lot of times where you can't buy yourself a shot.  That's going to anger some gamers. But it's a solid attempt at being realistic. You do sometimes brick dunks, screw up open layups, and it is hard to do a leaning shot towards the basket with two big men so close on you, you can tell what type of deodorant they don't use.  It's hard to accept. The game is as real as it can be, and that's both an attribute and a curse.  On paper it seems logical, but when you're bricking shots repeatedly, the frustration can't help but set in. Every seen a real NBA player get angry? You'll act out that whole scene yourself at one point. How's that for simulation?  If that sounds like a problem for you, then you may be more geared for the less realistic experience offered by Sega's competitors.   Regarding play-calling, the 2K series has always used the same system. Each team has a set of offensive plays. You can watch the plays run out for you so you can see how they should be done. But, does anyone even use this?  For most it's probably confusing.  It's one thing to be a sim, but this is where NBA 2K3 takes it too far.  You don't need X's and O plays.  There are only a few plays really run in the NBA and only those few generic plays that need to be in the game.    You don't need a bunch of different isolation plays or shots to set up the three.  It would be better if the D-pad were used to to call one of four loosely scripted plays -- one to get it inside, one to hit outside, a pick-and-roll, and an isolation play.  The problem is that if you don't use these plays the offense often just stands around.  This kills the flow of the game and is the reason why you will more than likely keep trying to drive the lane or throw it deep into the post. Having said that, it's about time something fresh came out of the play-calling system, so perhaps next year Visual Concepts will step up to the plate and bring us something new.  There are control problems for passing, too.  It's hard sometimes to pass to the right guy.  You can use icon passing for accuracy, but this is a two-button process, as you have to first bring up the icons and then select one to pass to.  Using the C-stick or just aiming and passing the normal way will often get you to throw to someone you didn't intend to give the ball to.  This happens most when you have a man deeper inside the arc than another player. You try to pass to the man in deep, but instead the game gives it to the man closer to you.  Something better has to come along because it's not easy to do give and goes.  This is another thing that hurts offensive game flow, because it's harder to pass quickly; meaning, you're more likely to play a one-man break-em-down type game. That works in arcade-type games, but it isn't going to work forever in a simulation.   ESPN Presented Added this year is the new presentation style seen in NFL 2K3. Sega bought the ESPN license and has used it well. The friendlier menus are just the beginning as you get some really cool post-game stuff.  Actually, in-game you get half-time break downs and a player named ~Hot at the Half~. After each day of play you can see a Nightly Wrap-up that breaks down every game and chooses a hot and cold player.  Anyone who had reservations about Sega buying the ESPN license needs to rethink their mindset, because this first attempt to use it has already proven valuable.  Street Mode NBA 2K3 offers several game modes. Street Mode lets you do 2-on2 up to full 5-player squads against friends of the computer. Rather than play in the normal arenas, you get to enjoy several famous street parks, all of them looking accurately represented.  This is the arcade-style of 2K3, and though Sega doesn't yet offer any kind of Franchise Mode for street (and they should), it's a nice break from the sim-action found in the rest of the game.  It's great for multiplayer purposes.  Tournament Mode Tournament Mode lets you set up your own tournaments so you can take on friends or the CPU.  It's similar to Playoff Mode, but has nothing to do with the official NBA playoffs.  If you don't want to play a season and would rather go straight to the playoffs, this is the way to go. There is only one problem here -- the game actually simulates the entire season first, meaning if the team you chose doesn't make the playoffs, you are out of luck.  Who would want to start a playoff mode if they weren't going to be in the playoffs?  It's these little inconsistencies that continue to hold the series back.  Franchise Mode You'll spend most of your time here.  Borrowing a lot from the excellent NFL 2K3 Franchise Mode, NBA 2K3 takes career hooping to a new level of excellence.  The main problem right now so we can concentrate on the goodness is that it is not intuitive at all.  Sure, you can figure out how to pull off trades and make it through a season, but the off-season is really a bit confusing.  It's not that you can't figure out what to do, but it seems like after each step there is something missing.    For example, when you run training camp and choose what you want each player to work on, you'd think the game would then tell you about their progress.  Instead, you press start and are immediately taken to the next step without any knowledge about how training camp has gone.  It all seems a bit rushed.   New this year are coaches. Each coach has three skill categories: defense, offense, and teaching.  They will be rated as poor, average, good, and master.  The better they are, the more they can help improve the team in certain categories.  But a coach is only useful on younger players, as older ones are more set in their ways.  You can fire your coach at any time during the season and hire another from a free agent pool.  Haven't we all wanted to do that?   You can also import your class from NCAA College Basketball 2K3, which comes out this winter.  However, even if you don't play the college game, you can get plenty of enjoyment from the off-season options in Franchise Mode.  Before we get into that, we have to give major applause to Visual Concepts for including plenty of seasonal and post season awards.  The awards include: League MVP, Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man, Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player, All-NBA First Team, Second Team, and Third Team, All-Defensive Team, Playoff MVP, and Finals MVP.     The off-season, like the rest of Franchise Mode, is graphical. Rather than just using menus, you'll have the draft in an actual auditorium. You'll even watch the lottery, though it's basically just a revealing of the draft order through flipping cards with team logos on them. When scouting for the draft, you assign a number of workouts to a player, but those workouts cost money, which counts against the amount of cash in your team's till.  So with smart budgeting you can scout more players and get more info.  There are even foreign players in the draft, and after about five or so years in the Franchise Mode, you'll see many more foreign players coming into the league.  Everything about the scouting and draft set-up is great, but, as with the general feel of Franchise Mode, it's not too intuitive.  At draft day, if you didn't know to press down on the C-stick on the middle computer screen to get to look at your PDA, how would you ever know it's there?  Answer: You wouldn't.  One problem with Franchise Mode we did notice was that the All-Star game never changed venue. You will always play in Atlanta, even ten years down the line.  That's a bit sloppy for a company making such a fine game.  And, ultimately, it is yet another thing that holds the series back. VC puts a lot into certain aspects, but then neglects another areas that need some attention.  Overall, though, despite some nagging issues, the Franchise Mode is fantastic and the best of any basketball game to date.  Just get used to playing the mid-winter classic in Atlanta every year.  Graphics The best looking b-ball game yet.  It has great player models that show off the right muscle tone and size for just about every player.  Additionally, the faces are now better than ever -- they even have different sized heads.  Just enter replay and close in on anyone.  Faces are amazingly accurate and animated.  You can actually see Jordan jawing as he goes for a dunk.  Even new guys like Mike Dunleavy Jr. are picture perfect as well.  To add extra sweetness, many players have multiple hair stylings.  It's not just going from fro to cornrows, but it gets into the nit-picky details.  Allen Iverson has multiple types of cornrows -- one straight, one crosshatched.  That's attention to detail like we've never seen.   Also, each stadium is accurate and individually lighted. The Oakland Arena in real life, for example, is much darker than most and that now shows in the game. This also means that the lighting on players changes. It's subtle, but if you look you can see the difference in stadiums. This year also includes specular highlighting for sweat effects. As the game goes on, players start to heat up, and that sweat now shows. You can even see sweat on some brows in the replays. It's very nice, even if a bit overboard at times.   Lastly, as you might expect from Visual Concepts, the animations are superb, as plenty of new motion-captures were added for all aspects of the game. Over 200 dunks and layups were added, for starters.  You won't see a lot of repetition, which makes for an enjoyable ride to the hoop every time.  Sound This is a case of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  To start with the good, a new system was implemented to help make the play-by-play sound smoother.  Basically, all the commentary was cut up into tiny fragments so that they could be pieced together more quickly and coherently.  Most of the in-game commentary is accurate and happens in time with the player, rather than while another play is going on.  There are occasional mishaps, but overall it's very solid.  The bad is that players give off tons of chatter in addition to the noisy crowds.  All of the ambient sounds are well done, but most of your jabber will be coming from you, which can be a bit much.  Now for the ugly part. You know all that arhived color commentary that seems to be in every version of NBA 2K? Well, it's back. There's some new flavor, but most of it is the same. And that makes the game feel old instantly.  It's great that Visual Concepts has so many samples to build on, but there hasn't been much improvement to the library. Fans of the series will tear their hair out, because it's still repeating from last year. NBA 2K3 is the game to get if you want as realistic an NBA experience as possible. This is by far the best basketball sim out there.  However, if you are looking for an experience closer to old-school b-ball games like NBA Jam, then you don't want to go here. There are other solid basketball games that offer a more arcadey experience. There's nothing wrong with any of those games, but none of them manage the intelligent AI, the amazingly realistic graphics, or as real a hoops experience as NBA 2K3.  Yes, there are nagging problems and I think next year the flow of gameplay needs to be addressed, but this is about as good as basketball games get. The Franchise Mode is improved and will be even better once NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is out and the senior class can be imported into the draft.If you've always been with Sega's hoop title, don't stop now, it's been fixed and made even better.  If you're new and looking for a really solid sim that does basketball intelligently and realistically, this is your game. And if you want a more run-and-gun fun style, then maybe try one of the other offerings this year, because NBA 2K3 don't mess and if you're not prepared, it will aggravate you.", "date": "Oct 4, 2002"}
