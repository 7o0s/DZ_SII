Ubi Soft's original game design was made with the power of the system's in mind with their ability to display 3D objects and cast light and shadows in strategic locations. Which is a good thing that Ubi Soft's GBA development team only took the basic idea of the Sam Fisher character and constructed a unique, GBA-specific gaming environment for the portable gamers. It doesn't play much like the console games, but it's still a very enjoyable experience in its own right. Features More than 11 missions GameCube connectivity Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  The Game Boy Advance version of Splinter Cell lifts characters, situations, and missions straight out of the game design built on the consoles. When two CIA agents mysteriously vanish in the Soviet republic of Georgia, the NSA's secret agency deploys Sam Fisher to recover them. Sam's got mad combat and espionage abilities, and players will have to put them to use in every inch of the levels; sneaking, crawling, running, climbing, and the occasional weapon fire are all a part of the job. There are eleven missions in all to complete, including the very, very important and helpful training area, as well as one unlockable secret mission. And unique to the GBA version is the ability to link the game up to the GameCube version and  download an additional five levels.  Where the console versions of Splinter Cell let players explore every inch of the areas in 3D, the Game Boy Advance doesn't have that luxury. The game designers opted to take all of Sam Fisher's techniques and abilities and move them into missions that feel more like Prince of Persia or Out of this World. It makes sense, though, since the GBA just doesn't have enough under the hood to give off a good, believable first-and-third person viewpoint like the console games. The game designers moved as much of the console game as conceivably possible to this perspective, so what players did in the console game, GBA players will be able to do in the handheld rendition. Okay, not everything; players can't grapple with enemies and toss 'em around like rag dolls.  But because of the side-scrolling environment, missions and challenges are designed a lot more rigidly; in the console game, players could choose many different ways to approach a specific situation. This form of gaming freestyle isn't exactly a part of the GBA version, since levels pretty much have to be completed the way they were designed. The challenge is partially in discovering what needs to get done, sure, but there aren't different ways in accomplishing the task at hand. That's why the GBA version of Splinter Cell doesn't exactly feel like the console games. But it still feels great and is a lot of fun to experience.  There is one matter to gripe at, though. As well designed as the levels are in this game, Splinter Cell does confirm what other GBA games, like X2: Wolverine's Revenge have proven: stealth just doesn't really work in a side-scrolling environment. Since character sprites only have a 2D line-of-sight in left/right scrolling games, so designers generally limit what they can see to a few feet in front of them. And it honestly looks retarded to see a guard walk towards you, stand about ten feet away, and turn the other direction as if he never saw you there. But it's to make the gameplay as forgiving as possible, and without dumbing down the opposition, it just wouldn't be fair to the player. But it still looks stupid. The stealth element is handled this way throughout the adventure, but there are spots where players can push Sam into the darkness in order to pass by guards without resorting to weapons fire. On the console, the darkness looks like it's part of the environment, but on the GBA, these spots look artificially plastered in. If you see one, it's obvious that the level designers want you to put it to use for a specific reason, and the same guy pacing back and forth in front of it is obviously why it's there.  But even though the stealth portions of the game feel a bit awkward and unrealistic, they're a significant part of the game design, and to be honest, they aren't that bad. The missions are also broken up into little ~mini-games~ of sort to offer a bit more variety than simply wandering around the side-scrolling areas. Like the console game, players will have to unlock safes and doors using Sam's lock picking skills; these are presented as mini-challenges that are, for lack of a better word, twitch-based. Players will have to rotate or trigger tumblers in succession before time runs out; if players can't get the lock opened in time, it can seriously hurt the progress of the rest of the missions. These lock picking challenges aren't tremendously challenging, but as players get deeper into the game the locks get more complex with a much faster time clock. There are also areas where players can pull out a sniping weapon, playing a mini-game that feels like it was lifted straight out of Silent Scope.Splinter Cell for the Game Boy Advance isn't exactly a game for the Metal Gear Solid crowd, as its stealth portions require far less strategy; the enemies only have two directions to go, which makes them easy to read. No, this game is for the fans of the Prince of Persia genre, as the action is more structured in ~figure out the puzzle~ fashion; in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the team that worked on this game is currently in development on Ubi Soft's GBA version of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The engine is certainly capable and versatile enough. Even with the limited stealth portions of the game, Splinter Cell is a great and challenging action game with a good amount of extras if you're into that whole Connecting to the Cube thing.", "date": "Apr 29, 2003"}
