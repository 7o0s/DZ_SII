Most new handsets include cameras anyway, and considering the success of Sony's EyeToy, isn't it about time? May I direct them to KDDI America's new Photo Aquarium, a cute little breeding game where you ~feed~ your virtual fish by taking pictures of colorful real world objects.   Depending on the color composition of your snaps, the fish will react accordingly. If you take a picture of their favorite color, they will greedily devour the photo on pixel at a time. If it's something they aren't terribly hungry for, they will nibble around at it. The more you feed your fish their favorite colors, the more eggs they will lay. Eggs hatch into new fish, and the great circle of life continues.   This isn't an exactly deep application, but it caught me by surprise how ~into~ it I became. I started looking around my house for different things I could take a picture of, just to see if the fish would enjoy it. Then I started walking outside my front door and inspected the neighborhood for treats. Sometimes I noticed the fish changing colors, depending on what I fed them. For example, by feeding the fish a picture of my orange cat, they turned orange themselves.   Photo Aquarium requires attention. The game uses the phone's clock to know how long you were away. If your fish eat the entire photo during your absence, some of them may swim away. Fortunately, the game has variable speeds. I found myself using the 100x, just so results were a little more immediate.  Photo Aquarium may surprise you as much as it did me. I expected it to come off gimmicky and within a day or two of playing, I'd be done with it. But I'm not. I'm still searching out new colors so I can create a rainbow menagerie inside my virtual fish tank. If you're looking for a mobile game -- actually, this is kind of a non-game -- that is a little off the beaten path, consider Photo Aquarium. You may find yourself hooked.", "date": "Jun 11, 2005"}
