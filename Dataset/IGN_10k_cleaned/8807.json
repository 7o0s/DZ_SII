Starred in every kind of game, tried out every different genre. He's been around for 25 years now, and he's spent those two and a half decades jumping from platformers to puzzlers, from party games to racers  but it wasn't always that way. It wasn't long ago, really, when the thought of Mario being placed into certain types of game designs would raise the collective eyebrows of the industry, and no concept was quite so quizzically questioned as the idea of Nintendo's hero headlining an RPG.   Now, in 2007, we know that role-playing plus plumber is a perfect pair  we've seen the excellence of the original Super Mario RPG on the SNES, and the ingenuity of Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga on the GBA. The most influential of all of Mario's role-playing outings, though, has to be this  Paper Mario. Originally arrived on the Nintendo 64 only six and a half years ago, it's this design that's proven to have the biggest Mario RPG impact. It's this design that's prompted the creation of two direct, successful sequels.   And this design is, essentially, a pop-up book. Paper Mario places Mario into a paper world. He's two-dimensional, as are his friends, and they're all living in a 3D, fold-up, flip-out take on the Mushroom Kingdom. It's an intended clash, and one that works  Paper Mario's flattening of its fattened hero makes the game memorable, and opens up ample opportunity for classic visual gags.   The visuals come through the Virtual Console filter with predictable results  the 3D environments are sharper and cleaner, while the 2D elements stand out in overpixilization. It's not bad. The process of presenting N64 efforts at a higher-than-intended resolution has harmed other games from that era that have come to the VC, making the sparsely placed two-dimensional objects in those games ~pop~ in annoying, distracting ways. But 2D, sprite-based characters are so overflowingly prevalent in Paper Mario that you can't help but get used to the blocky edges. It's really not bad.   The gameplay is role-playing first, with platforming and exploration elements playing an equally important supporting role. Mario hops, bops and jumps through traditional, colorful Mushroom Kingdom environments until he comes upon an enemy  there, the scene shifts into a battle played out against a pop-up backdrop. Combat is turn-based, alternating between Mario and his enemies, and is refreshingly simple, but never boring. Simple, because Mario's abilities are kept contained into only a few manageable categories like jumping, hammering and using items. Never boring, because of the game's use of action commands.   The concept has found its way into every Mario RPG, and it makes battles feel much more immersive and fun  action commands reward you with extra attack power or improved defense if you correctly time a button press or other input action with the battle animation that's playing out on screen. The most simple example is Mario's jump attack  he can do a single hop onto an enemy's head for minor effect, but if you hit the A Button just as his feet make first contact with the foe he'll bounce up into the air, then come crashing down a second time for double the damage.   The commands join together with Mario's many sidekick characters, equippable effect-activating badges and summonable star spells to create a unique, satisfying battle experience that's constantly evolving and getting more complicated, bit by bit, all the way through the quest's eight chapters of play. It's all presented at the perfect pace, though, so the interface never feels more complicated than you can handle  and really, even as you're facing off in the final confrontation the system's still not as complex as many other, much more obtuse RPGs.  After over 100 different Wii Shop downloads, it's not often now that a game makes me actively excited to get connected, click through to New Releases and confirm a purchase  but Paper Mario did just that. It's an excellent title that's pure Nintendo, it's held up very well even placed into context against its GameCube and Wii era sequels, and it's an RPG for goodness sakes. It's about time we had a true, deep, hours-upon-hours long adventure to be able to spend our Wii Points on  and here it is, so do just that. Paper Mario will run you 1000 of your Points, and it's worth every one. Grab it and enjoy one of Mario's best ~different genre~ placements.", "date": "Jul 21, 2007"}
