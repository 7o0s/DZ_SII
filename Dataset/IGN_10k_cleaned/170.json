However, at $40 on the Wii and $30 on the DS, it felt more than a bit overpriced. PC gamers can now buy Ninja Reflex: Steamworks Edition for $9.95 on Steam, Valve's digital distribution system, and while that's a price point that's more appropriate for the game, there's still not a whole lot to this entire affair.   The game centers around six minigames that are geared toward honing your reflexes, as you play a young ninja in training. There's a shuriken minigame where you have to hurl throwing stars at various targets, and this unfolds just like target shooting at a gun range, completing with moving paper targets. Then there's a hashi minigame that's all about trying to catch flies using nothing but chopsticks. A koi minigame challenges you to catch a variety of fish using nothing but your bare hands. The katana minigame gives you practice with sword blocking and swinging at ghostly targets. Then there's a hotaru minigame gauges the speed of your reflexes, as you must tap the mouse button as soon as a firefly appears on screen. Lastly there's the nunchaku minigame, which is sort of like batting practice.    Each minigame has up to six modes that become more challenging the deeper you get in the game. For example, in the picky catch mode for koi fishing, you'll have a small amount of time to capture a certain fish in the pond. As you rank up and gain higher color belts, you'll have to revisit this mode over and over again, and the amount of time that you're allotted continually shrinks. The goal is to become a third-degree black belt, which means that you've got to play dozens upon dozens of minigame modes.   And that's about it. That's pretty much all that Ninja Reflex is about. You just play those minigames over and over. And while the minigames can be enjoyable and challenging, the sheer repetition can become grating after a while. The designers throw in some meditation modes, but those require you to basically just shut your eyes and contemplate existence, with or without the narrator's heavily-accented voice in the background. Oh, there's a multiplayer mode, but it's not online or networked at all. Instead, you can have up to four players taking turns at the same computer. This is a far cry from the Wii game that allows everyone to play simultaneously.    Admittedly, the PC version does look very nice, especially at higher resolutions like 1920x1200. Unfortunately, my game would never remember the resolution settings, so quitting and restarting always kicked it back to 1024x768, necessitating going back into the video options and setting it back up to 1920x1200 again. Strangely enough, it did remember other video settings, such as anti-aliasing being turned on. Still, the visuals are bright and lush and full of all sorts of fun Valve references, like the sensei wearing Gordon Freeman glasses, the Half-Life lambda popping up in all sorts of places, as well as everyone's favorite Weighted Companion Cube from Portal acting as a prop.Even at $10, Ninja Reflex just doesn't seem to pack a ton of value, and the repetitive nature of the minigames may grate on you after a while. There's also a sense that this is probably a much better game on the Wii, since that system actually requires you to use your arms like a ninja. The PC version, on the other hand, will just tax your wrists and mouse button finger.", "date": "Apr 16, 2008"}
