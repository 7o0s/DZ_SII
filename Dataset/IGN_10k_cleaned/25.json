While earlier titles have focused their efforts on either letting us play as the famous crews we all know (Judgement Rites, Star Trek Anniversary, Star Trek: The Next Generation, et al) or trying to bring a currently popular genre into the Star Trek universe (Klingon Honor Guard, Star Trek: Generations, and so on), all we've ever really wanted to do is to have our own adventures in the universe, independent of the characters we've seen on TV. While Interplay's own Starfleet Academy came closest to delivering this dream, it emphasized combat without giving players enough access to the strategies and weapons that would actually be used by a Starfleet Captain. Worse still, it didn't offer enough flexibility to allow us to choose the way our careers would unfold. What was really needed was a system that enabled fast paced combat, random event gameplay and a load of different storylines all within a framework that was easy enough for anyone to learn. With their latest release, Starfleet Command, Interplay and the guys over at 14 Degrees East almost nailed them all. By basing their game on the proven rule set of the Starfleet Battles boardgame, the team has managed to find a system that comes as close as anything yet released to delivering the feeling of actually living out a career in the Star Trek universe.  For those of you who don't know anything at all about this title, here's the basic run down. Starfleet Command is a 2D strategy game that starts you off in the role of a young cadet on his way to commanding his first starship. Rather than focus all of its attention on the Federation, Interplay has been kind enough to serve up six different races from the Star Trek universe, each with their own ship types and special strengths and weaknesses. As you begin the game you'll have to work your way through several tutorials that are designed to teach you the basics of starship command. Once you've completed these missions you'll be assigned to a small craft of your own and sent out to protect your empire. You'll start by checking out a Galactic Map that shows the current political borders of the galaxy and tells you which races your race is currently at war with. You can also choose to travel to different sectors on this map to get your ship closer (or further away) from where the action is. Once you're ready, Starfleet will send you a mission ranging from the fairly common (bad ships are in the area, please blow the crap out of them) to the more interesting (pirates have disabled a ship and sent it hurtling towards the sun  don't let it get crispy). After you complete each mission, your performance is reviewed and you are given 'prestige' points that represent how well thought of you are. You can spend these prestige points on repairing and refitting your ship, gaining better officers, or requisitioning new ships to your command. You can have up to three ships in your service at one time. Sound easy enough? Let's move on.  At its core, Starfleet Command is a real-time strategy game that places most of its emphasis on combat rather than resource gathering or exploration. Although you will occasionally receive assignments that will require you to be stealthy or non-confrontational, most of the time you'll eventually find yourself in the middle of a big fight. Unlike traditional RTS games though, there's a lot more to combat than just pointing your ship at a target and waiting for the results. In this game, even if you're better armed than your opponent, if you just fly in a straight line and fire every so often, you'll get creamed. In order to win, you'll need to learn how to take advantage of all the tools available to you  and that's an awful lot. In fact, the sheer number of different ways to handle each combat engagement is one of the main reasons that Starfleet Command is so addictive. Every time you lose, you have to go back and try a different strategy to see if you can make things right.  While Starfleet Command doesn't have the typical resource gathering set-up, it won't take you but one or two battles to realize that your success is most definitely dependant on proper resource management. Starfleet Command basically a balancing act that requires you to quickly choose between different systems that are all very important and that all drain your energy reserves. Because of this fact, the most important things to watch on your ship are your engines. These not only provide you with the power to move (very handy during combat situations), but they also give your ship the energy required to run every single system onboard.  If your ship's engines get too badly damaged, you not only won't be able to run away from your enemy, you'll also be unable to fire at him, to recharge your shields, or use electronic countermeasures against his weapons. Once you're sure that your energy needs are being met, the next thing you'll want to keep an eye on is your shield strength. Represented by a glowing hexagon surrounding your ship, your six shields protect your ship from taking real damage in combat. Once your shields are down on a given side, any more damage you take to that hex quadrant will start causing points to disappear off your hull strength and will most likely start causing all sorts of problems with your ship's internal workings as well. As with every other system on your ship, charging and re-charging your shields costs you energy (a lot of energy). Once your shields are down, they can be reinforced, but this puts a continual drain on the power reserves you're going to need to make sure that you can get rid of whoever has hurt you so badly to begin with. Yep, that's right, recharging most of your weapons takes energy (and time) every time you fire any weapon but a missile, it will take you a certain amount of time to recharge the weapon before you can fire it again. How fast this recharge process goes depends on how much energy you have available. While all of this may sound like a bit much (and frankly it can get to be pretty hard to keep up with in the middle of a firefight) the balance of resource management to combat is almost perfect and will keep you challenged without ever (okay most of the time) frustrating you.  As I stated above, there's a lot more choices available to you than just putting up your shields and firing your weapons. Starfleet Command also boasts several secondary systems that can all be used to come up with more clever ways to defeat your enemy. First off, you have mines. Mines work just like you'd imagine they would  you drop them off the back of your ship and they explode when anything comes within their range. These nasty little beauties can give a hell of surprise to an enemy who's baring down on you from behind and are even more deadly when used in tandem with the transporter. That's right, I said the transporter. While it may not seem like an offensive weapon, it can most certainly be used like one if you're quick enough. Your first option (and perhaps the simplest one) is to use your transporter to teleport mines right in front of your enemy. This abusive tactic is a great way to encourage your opponent to turn (trying to avoid the mine) in a direction that gives you a shot at areas where his shields have gone down. The transporter can also be used to teleport your onboard marines over to the enemy's ship. Here they can either run commando raids trying to disable or destroy weapons systems that you've targeted or they can fight it out with the defender's marines in an attempt to take control of the whole ship. This last tactic is a great way to not only get rid of an enemy, but to also gain an ally that will help you out for the rest of the mission. Several missions will actually require you to take command of an enemy vessel rather than destroying it. Another normally peaceful system that can be used for combat are the shuttle bays which can be used to launch four different types of combat shuttles. Basic administrative shuttles can be launched to act as a sort of secondary protection for your ship. In this role they fly around and fire their (rather weak) phasers at anything that gets too close to you. Scatterpack shuttles leave the bay, lock onto the enemy and fire six large missiles from their current location (this is really nasty and is a good way to surprise someone who thinks you're too hurt to fight back). Wild Weasel shuttles leave the bay and immediately start to project sensor decoy signals that make it harder for your enemy to get a lock on you. Finally, you have the option to launch Suicide shuttles. These craft are armed with a giant anti-matter bomb that goes off if the shuttle can make to the other ship without getting destroyed. Other options you have available to you include cloaking systems (only certain races like the Romulans actually have access to cloaking devices), ECM (which makes you harder for the enemy to hit), ECCM (which fights ECM and makes it easier for you to hit your target) and probes (which will help you identify what your opponent is carrying in the way of weaponry while he's still far enough away to run from). There are far more options here than there is energy to run them all, so each player will start making decisions about which tools they rely on in combat. The end result is a challenging space battle simulation that really delivers a personal feel.   While Starfleet Command's combat is certainly entertaining, the real strength og the game is in its mission structure. When the game begins, you'll be given random missions based on where you are in the galaxy and how big your fleet is. As the game progresses though, you'll eventually be given the option to join a special faction of whichever race you've selected. If you accept (I think it's really cool that they don't make you do anything in this game), you'll start getting, from time to time, special missions that require special skills and will pay off bigger prestige points if you're successful. Each of these special task force missions delivers a lot of the flavor of watching Star Trek episodes, but from several different points of view. It's great to play as a member of the Starfleet Special Task Force (the Federation's elite organization) or as part of the Klingon Empire's Black Staff but it's even cooler to learn more about less talked about races from the inside by playing as part of the Romulan Tal Prai'ex or Tal Shi'ar or as a member of one of the three different Lyran elite forces. Sadly, 14 Degrees East was unable to finish up the elite missions for the three Hydran and three Gorn elite factions, but Erik Bethke, the game's designer, assures me that these will all be completed and offered to users free of charge sometime in September or October. Each of these elite forces storylines was written by the same guy who did the stories for Judgement Rites and 25th Anniversary and offers its own specific challenges and flavor. I can't emphasize enough how cool they'll be to fans of the original series.  Another really impressive thing about Starfleet Command is that it presents itself really well, especially considering the fact that it's a strategy game. The game looks phenomenal  all of the ships have been painstakingly researched and 3Dmodeled and move fast and realistically. Better still are the game's effects. When a ship blows up, it makes brilliant explosions with huge ship pieces drifting of from the still glowing area of destruction. All of the weapons, from phasers to photon torpedoes to disruptors all look like tiny versions of the same systems used in the Star Trek movies. Since all of the original sound effects are in there as well, the whole effect is like getting to watch one of the films from whatever angle you want to. Voice acting adds to this whole feel  every race has its own voice that takes you through the tutorial missions. While I thought all of them were very well done, George Takei's performance in the Federation missions is definitely the cream of the crop.  I really enjoyed the multiplayer games, but without the same setup and background of the single player missions, they seemed a tad simple. The real strength of the multiplay is that every player will have their own tactics and their own favorite races and ships to use. The best games we had were team games with three ships playing on each side. After playing so many missions watching out for my own butt, it was quite a challenge to start watching out for the guy on my wing as well. Overall the multiplayer setup will appeal to die-hard fans of the game (and especially fans of the original Starfleet Battles) but I don't think it'll excite new players all that much.  In the end, Starfleet Command offers up one of the most innovative looks at the RTS game that I've seen in a really long time. Just about every strategy fan who has the patience to learn all the controls (and you have to read the manual here folks, the tutorials leave quite a bit of important stuff out) will be happy with the purchase of this game. With that said, I did have quite a few stability issues with this title (it kicked me out to Windows about a dozen times before I stopped counting) and it's frighteningly hard to learn if you're not patient. With those caveats in place, I highly recommend this title to everyone.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Aug 12, 1999"}
