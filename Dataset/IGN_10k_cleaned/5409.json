{"name": "Blade: Trinity", "name_review": "Blade: Trinity", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/18/blade-trinity-2", "text": "Mobile maker Mforma just signed an exclusivity deal with comics magnate Marvel to create and release a suite of handset games based on their white-hot properties. The first title to come out of that arrangement is Blade: Trinity, based on the new move of the same name. Fans of the Wesley Snipe vehicle are probably easy marks for this game, but should the rest of us take a jaunt with the Daywalker?   Blade: Trinity is another striking example of a pleasing recent development in mobile game making: the good licensed game. The problems and issues with Blade: Trinity don't rise from handling the license badly. In fact, Mforma has done a good job implementing little ~Blade-~ touches throughout the entire game, such as weapons from Blade's arsenal and stylish vamps.   Blade is armed with his trademark sword, as well as pistols that fire silver bullets -- which turn vamps into ash. (Isn't it werewolves that don't like silver?) Blade has a homing weapon that seeks out vampire hearts and reduces them to cinders. This becomes a favorite weapon as soon as you get it, as it really helps thin out busy vampire hordes.   Where Blade: Trinity goes bump in the night is from the game's length and difficulty. And some of that difficulty comes not from actually fighting off clever enemies, but from an unfortunate in-game tic. When you attack, you better mean it. Blade has an attack-specific animation and nothing will stop it once you start. So if the vamp you want to slay isn't right in front of your face, get ready to be hit from the back or side. This is extremely annoying, but it's not a deal-breaker.   Blade: Trinity looks very, very good. The game's locations look pretty close to their movie counterparts. You know you are in the police station because it looks, well, like a police station, complete with tape recorders, water coolers, and we're pretty sure we spotted a doughnut. The vamp HQ also sports the slick-goth look of Drake's (Dracula) skyscraper. Blade's enemies are plentiful and sport multiple costumes. And the animation is pretty well done for a mobile game.  Blade: Trinity is a pretty good action game for fans of both the genre and the films. (Honestly, I liked the game more than the eye-rolling movie. ~She likes to listen to MP3s while she hunts.~ Please, who calls them MP3s? Not iPod users, I can tell you that.) I was slightly irritated by the sticking animation that made me a sitting duck, though. It's one of the better-looking 2D games I've seen in the last few months and will offer a few solid hours of vamp-slaying entertainment. I wish the audio was as polished as the visuals, but we can't have everything.I officially now have high hopes for Mforma's licensed Marvel games.", "date": "Dec 18, 2004"}
