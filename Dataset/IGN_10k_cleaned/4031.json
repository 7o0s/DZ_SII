While his 2001 debut on current generation systems was enjoyable in Ubisoft's Batman Vengeance (based on the animated series), his career was soon tarnished by Kemco's painful take on the Batman license. Batman: Dark Tomorrow, based on the dark and gritty Gotham City from DC comics, failed to stray from the gutter. Botched controls, horrid camera system, and generally bad -- it was indeed a Dark Tomorrow for Batman.   After much rehabilitation and steady counseling, Ubisoft has finally convinced Bruce Wayne to remove the paper bag from his head and don the Mantle of the Bat. Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu returns Batman to the world of the Warner Bros. animated series. This time around, the Dark Knight is up against a brand new villain, Sin Tzu (created by Jim Lee), who has released Gotham's criminally insane (Bane, Clayface, Scarecrow) from Arkham Asylum in an attempt to draw Batman out of the shadows. Sin Tzu has a passion for being the biggest, baddest dude around, but that giant bat signal in the sky says otherwise. Does Sin Tzu  beat the bat out of Bruce Wayne, or will Batman rise above licensed drudgery?   Gameplay  Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu has shed the previous Batman games' platforming action in favor of a straight up arcade brawler. Similar to Streets of Rage or Double Dragon, the Caped Crusader treks through Gotham City, visiting the likes of Crime Alley, City Hall, a chemical plant, and Arkham Asylum, whilst beating up every hoodlum that gets in his path.    Before you proceed to the minion beating, you'll have to choose which of the Bat-people you want to take into action. There's millionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne aka Batman, Boy Wonder ~Timothy Drake~ Robin, Barbara Gordon (Batgirl), or whiny Dick Grayson as Nightwing. Who do you choose? Each character shares the same arsenal of moves (although the animations are different), but like most fighters each character has a different combination of speed and strength. Batman is the slowest and most powerful while Robin is the fastest and weakest. However, as incentive to play as all the characters, Ubisoft has tweaked the Sin Tzu scenario so that the storyline is presented from each character's viewpoint.   After the story unfolds during the opening cut scene, Batman (or any of the other Bat-people) is dumped in Crime Alley for some combat practice. Your basic moves are punch and kick (which, if pressed rapidly, is turned into a three hit combo or if you stagger the presses becomes an uppercut or knee bash). Bat-person can also jump, perform a rolling dash, and throw a Batarang (which can ignite explosive barrels, stun bad guys, and trigger robotic sentry guards).   Your character's repertoire of moves grows as you progress through the game. Successfully landing combos, and performing them without getting hit, earns you points that can be traded in for new attacks. Among the thirty-five moves are punch/kick combos, throw moves, and buddy throws (in co-op one player grapples a baddie while the other performs a move). You'll also be able to snag some gadgetry upgrades like a grappling hook (to ensnare the baddies) or smoke pellets (stun opponents).   It's awesome that Ubisoft included all these combat options, but they serve no purpose. None of them are significantly stronger than others -- only harder to successfully execute. You can easily get through the game with only the generic three kick combo (which is the strongest move) because it's the easiest and fastest move to perform.   Combat quickly boils down to unexciting button mashing (unless you're aiming at visual flair with combos). This can be blamed on cloned thugs of whom there are three variations -- the weakling, the guy with a projectile weapon, and super thug (extended health bar). Their appearance changes with each level, but their difficulty does not. Instead, they simply multiply and learn new moves. As the enemies multiply, Batman will often find himself surrounded by thugs, and since he can't block or jump out of the way (his jump only works as an attack), he soon finds himself very dead.    Cheap deaths wouldn't be so bad if the combat were fun, which it's not, or if the levels spiced up the action. Instead, every level is exactly the same. The objective is always to save civilians or defuse bombs (essentially just moving into a glowing circle), whilst battling a slew of henchmen in a given time limit. The repetitive formula gets old fast -- and if it weren't Batman, you wouldn't want to play it past the first level.   Even boss battles are more annoying than cool. The first boss you encounter, Scarecrow, will use his hallucinogenic gas grenades to disappear into the shadows. You can only hurt him if you manage to hit him while he's invisible (ending the illusion). This has to be done by sound alone. While a cool idea, it's frustrating and seems more like a way to extend an otherwise simple boss fight. The other bosses also follow simple patterns, like most brawlers, that make victory unrewarding.   Contrary to most brawler game design, even playing Rise of Sin Tzu co-op does little to increase your enjoyment. Sure there are buddy moves to perform and someone to curse at when you die, but that sense of fun you get from games like Baldur's Gate or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade is sadly missing.   If the story mode doesn't deter you from Sin Tzu combat, there is also a challenge mode that ~challenges~ you to beat a designated number of thugs in a minute or see how many bad guys you can kill before dying. Completing challenges aids in unlocking several of the bonus features (which can also be purchased in the story mode), like 3D models, toys, concept art, Sin Tzu origin story, and a making of Sin Tzu documentary. These are all great extras, especially if you're a Batman fan, but unlocking them all is no easy or fun feat.    Graphics  Rise of Sin Tzu takes all of its artistic direction from the animated series. It's a faithful representation of the cartoon, and a joy to watch in motion. Characters are fluidly animated. Capes wrap around the figures as bodies contort in various martial arts poses or flap in the wind as the hero dashes about. Combat animations have been slowed down to successfully convey a sense of power -- an almost Matrix styled effect.   The coolest part of the game is what takes place in the backgrounds. Smoke billows realistically and will slowly clear away as one of the Bat-people walks through it. Cans swirl around in the wind, birds can be startled into flight, and bats will fly through the air. Thugs can be slammed through fences and street vendor booths (spilling fish and fruit onto the street), dent cars and dumpsters (sending paper flying into the air), and leave craters in the ground.   When the Scarecrow's goons unleash the hallucinogenic bombs, green smoke fills the screen, goons transform into skeletons or executioners, and the entire picture constantly contorts, which gives you the impression of hallucinating. Fire and explosions are beautiful to behold as the flame flares to life and quickly sends smoke billowing across the screen. The visuals are simply amazing.   Cut scenes also look great, if not quite as impressive -- simply because they look identical to the cartoon show. Load times are minimal. There were a few points were the game stuttered a little when a level first loaded or you triggered a cut scene, but otherwise Rise of Sin Tzu was smooth sailing.   Sound  The music dramatically adds to the game's experience. Each level has a different techno beat (which really gets you revved up for button mashing) that manages to incorporate the Batman theme in someway. It's the kind of music you don't mind listening to repeatedly (almost sounds like the FLCL soundtrack) and aids the flow of action.    Sound effects are also well done, and incredibly varied for a brawler. You'll hear numerous thudding and gagging sounds as Batman beats the poo out of hoodlums. Numerous thwacks, explosions, and demonic laughter also riddle the air. Of course, most of these aren't noticeable unless you turn down the techno, but they're there if you listen for them.   You'll also be able to hear Batman and crew spout out numerous one-liners and informative information like ~losing stamina~ or ~that's just what I needed~ when you lose or regain health. The voice acting in the cut scenes sounds like the talent used in the animated series (if they aren't the actual voice actors). The audio quality really makes Sin Tzu a more enjoyable place.This is one of the few games I've played where the parts are greater than the whole. I really wanted to love this game. The artwork and animation completely blow me away. I just had to see Sin Tzu in motion. Every time I saw cans swirling in the background or the smoke reacting to Batman's movements I got giddy. It's that pretty. Sound effects are equally and I wouldn't mind having the musical score on CD. The aural and visual presentation is what sucked me into the game and convinced me not to just quit in disgust. Sin Tzu has so much going for it. The story is told well and is worth seeing if you're a Batman fan, but the combat feels stale. I'm not sure how they managed to suck the fun from the title. One of the biggest problems is that you've got all these moves, but none of them are more powerful than the basic combos. The only reason I used the advanced combos was because I couldn't stand watching the same animation performed thousands of times. Lacking that magic spark, Batman is frustrating in its simplicity. Delve into this one if you're a Batman fan, but be prepared for the story to be the most (if not only) motivating play mechanic.", "date": "Oct 18, 2003"}
