Virgin's Grand Slam is a strong game, but due to its dated technology, it will remain a bench warmer in the sports genre.    Grand Slam does, however, have some really innovative features. For starters, it possesses a very unique pitching and batting configuration. The batting meter somewhat resembles those found on golf games, where you hold down the button until you hit a certain power meter, and then let go. The pitching meter works in a similar fashion.  Another innovative feature is the practice mode. This option allows you to practice every field position from right field to catcher.    Even though this game has many redeeming qualities, Grand Slam just gets more and more dull. Most annoying, however, is the presence of real players without the real teams. Frank Thomas is on Chicago, but not the Chicago White Sox. It's kind of like the toy He-Man and his low-grade copy Faker He-Man. Faker He-Man was just like the real thing, but he was blue and it just wasn't the same.  With sprite-based characters and poor player animation, Grand Slam does in fact get tiring to look at. It just doesn't have the eye candy that gamers yearn for. It may have sturdy gameplay, but the graphics amount to nothing more than a Genesis-era rehash.  PSX Staff", "date": "May 14, 1997"}
