Crave Entertainment recently snagged the rights to develop and publish Earthworm Jim titles on the portable, and it's finally available. While the game does have its moments, Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy doesn't have nearly the same magic that made it such a classic on the Genesis and Super Nintendo. Features  12 levels. Four weapons. Exclusive Game Boy Color level. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   This has nothing to do with the 3D action game that was released for the N64 a few weeks ago -- this adventure is more a revisit to the sidescrolling adventures Jim had on the previous 16-bit systems a few years back. Traverse 12 levels, collecting icons that will let you proceed to the next round.    The game is actually quite frustrating -- the whole idea is to collect every single ~nut~ icon in a given level. Once you've done that, you can head to the next world. Unfortunately, there are sometimes literally hundreds of these things floating around, and you have to undercover a few hidden ones that enemies have stowed away in their bodies -- in other words, blow the crap out of bad guys and you get a nut. But here's the kicker: die, and you start at the very beginning of the level -- this is pretty damn obnoxious considering some of the levels are downright huge and a pain in the butt to get around...but if you fall down a hole, all your work has been lost. It's this right here that would evaporate any last ounce of patience you might have, and is just cause for throwing your system across the room. Hell, I almost caught myself doing that once or twice reviewing the game.  The other complaint is the total disregard to what makes Earthworm Jim, Earthworm Jim. He's an earthworm in a super suit, and when Doug Tenapel created him for Shiny, the Genesis and Super NES game designers made sure you remembered that. You could whip your head out of your suit, attack enemies with it or latch onto hooks -- and when you let him sit still for a few seconds, he'd play jumprope with his body. None of this is in the Game Boy game, making Menace 2 the Galaxy a pale conversion of a great, classic sidescrolling action title. All you can do is jump and shoot, and occasionally pick up the jetcycle to cruise around the level -- that's it. There's not enough ~cleverness~ here, the same element that made Earthworm Jim one of the best and funniest action games on the 16-bit systems. The game is huge, the graphics are nice, and the playability is somewhat fun -- but this isn't the same Earthworm Jim I enjoyed on the console systems a few years back. There's no reason why it couldn't have been done on the Game Boy Color, and in this respect, I'm very disappointed. But as a sidescrolling action game on the system, it's among the better ones, but it still lacks in comparison to Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tarzan -- two of the best in the genre for the color handheld. Mildly amusing, but it could have been a lot better.", "date": "Nov 18, 1999"}
