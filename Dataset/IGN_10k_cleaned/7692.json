Twitch controls? Something to laugh at? Something to play with friends?  As most would answer, it depends on the genre of the game. Nobody would expect 4X strategic warfare from a Mario Party game, or so we hope. Gothic III is an open-ended action-RPG setting players loose on a huge tract of land littered with population centers. What you do on your travels is for you to decide. You still get side quests with specific goals, but there's no prescribed order to them and sometimes multiple ways to complete them. For many gamers, this type of design is a liberating, progressive one, even if it has been around for a while. It offers a fresh alternative to the droves of linear titles churned out every year that require you to rescind free will for strict progression. The Gothic series has always been about letting you decide, giving you the power. With such a promising, alluring premise, it's a disappointment to see how crippled Piranha Bytes' Gothic III turned out to be.   The game starts off as you arrive in Myrtana, a forested, hilly landmass sandwiched between icy Nordmar in the north and dusty Varant to the south. As the bearded Nameless Hero from the first two games, you arrive by boat almost directly after the events of Gothic II. You'll immediately meet up with some familiar characters, and after a brief introductory fight be filled in on Myrtana's situation. It seems the orcs have overrun the region, turning the human cities and outposts into slave camps. Eventually you branch out into Verant and deal with the dual-wielding desert dwellers known as the Hashishin, the Nomads, and into the snowy wastes at the continent's northern end. In all, Gothic III's landscape is enormous, and often beautiful to behold.    Building reputation is the core of the gameplay. By heading into a town and completing quests you gain favor in that community and sometimes with one of the game's six factions. Gaining enough town favor allows you access to its leader, which results in a quest to annihilate an opposing population center. Depending on which faction you're planning on working with, this could result in you smashing an orc stronghold or wiping out a rebel camp. Should you undertake one of these larger scale missions, such as aiding the rebels to pulverize an orc-controlled town and free the slaves, the rebels will take up residence there afterwards. This works to give you the sense you're actually making a difference in the world to a more effective degree than the fleeting thanks of a quest giver.   Completing quests and killing enemies earns you experience which, as you might expect, levels you up. Each level earns you learning points, which can then be spent at trainers and shrines to boost your melee or bow abilities, learn new spells, boost health and mana reserves, and augment smithing, thieving, alchemy skills. It's a good system that allows you to easily customize The Nameless Hero to your play style.   Unfortunately, the quests themselves don't offer much variety, consisting mostly of fetch and kill quests. If you don't like a certain batch of quests, you can always move on to the next town. However, this means whenever you return to a town you'll have to deal with the game's quest log. Like many other aspects of Gothic III, the quest log stumbles around on the shaky wall dividing a game's drive to mimic reality and be user-friendly. While the log can be organized based on where a quest was obtained, the descriptions are woefully inadequate. Snippets of your conversation with the NPC are recorded, which many times provides little to no insight on what you're supposed to do. Even when an entire quest conversation had been recorded, the goal still could still be vague, which is where the ~realism~ part comes in. It makes sense for an NPC to not know where a specific cave is or where a plot-important NPC is holed up, and it's part of the fun of Gothic III to find out exactly what the deal is. Still, it's far too easy to forget what you were doing or where quest givers were in a certain area if you've been hacking around in other parts.    The nod towards game realism over user-friendliness continues with the placement of teleportation stones. These things can be picked up in every community and allow the player instantaneous travel to that area afterwards. While a few are easy to find, it eventually becomes a gigantic pain to nail all these down since they're tucked away in obscure locations. Sure, it may make sense that a teleportation stone may not be in an obvious place if it's a valuable item. After all, nobody leaves a diamond necklace sitting on their front stoop, right? Unfortunately it translates into an unnecessarily frustrating experience for the gamer to hunt them all down. In Geldern and Braga, for instance, we rooted around for over an hour before discovering the stones were being carried around by certain town dwellers. We only found this out by randomly knocking them out. In other communities, the stones are buried in random treasure chests, ensuring you'll waste large amounts of time.     The game's need to stay true to realism is starkly contrasted by the combat, which proves strikingly shallow and glitchy. Just to give you an idea, we were able to slaughter the entire town of Trelis by repeatedly clicking the left mouse button to kill an opponent with sword swings, running and hiding behind a wall, and then repeating. Pressing and holding LMB allows for a power swing, parrying with a weapon or shield is accomplished by holding the RMB, and from there a quick strike can be initiated with a LMB click. Even with these options, nothing remains as effective as jamming LMB. The game automatically directs you to an opponent should there be a group around, and you can switch up targets if you like by turning your character around. While locked in, nobody else will attack you unless they're firing arrows or magic blasts. As a result, you can stand in a group, target one foe, and initiate a barrage of LMB strikes, taking down one opponent after another. A humanoid's general reaction is to block, a beast's general reaction is to back up. As long as you continue to hit LMB, you'll occasionally pierce their flesh with your weapon. Though this method proves amazingly effective, opponents humanoid and beast alike will occasionally unleash a practically unblockable series of attacks that more often than not kill your character. This seemed to be especially true of beasts. Either way, combat is reduced to a trivial affair where you jam LMB, run and heal, run back in, jam LMB, and win. If this game is trying to mimic how a real world functions, how does it fit that one man is able to take down an entire town by doing figure-eight's with a bladed weapon?    Magic and bow options are available as well, and both can do big amounts of damage. However, both require you to be at a distance from your opponents. This seemed to be possible with beasts as they tended to move more slowly. With speedy humanoids combat quickly moves to close range, requiring you to switch to melee and start up another brainless LMB click-fest. Regardless of who you're fighting, you can count on numerous bouts of retaliation attacks that can't be anticipated, resulting in your death and a game reload.   The combat runs into even more issues that pile on frustration. First, opponents can run through walls. Not every wall, mind you, but it occurred with surprising regularity. We saw NPCs run through solid rock, monsters move effortlessly through cave walls, and humanoids breeze right through stone ruins. They also seemed to get stuck at certain points. For instance, a large group of foes attempting to cross a bridge all got glued together somehow, jittering in a line as we waited patiently at the other end for an opponent to detach themselves. In some instances we saw groups of baddies freeze in place as we watched from a distance, only resuming their battle actions after we planted an arrow in the back of their necks. Some opponents didn't seem to realize they were being attacked, never drawing a weapon, others suddenly veered in totally wrong directions while pursuing us in combat, while others got stuck in ceilings yet still managed to continue the battle while only half-present in the room. The Nameless Hero gets stuck frequently as well. If there's any debris on a battlefield, you'll want to move to a different location. Even when stepping up on a small rock, the Nameless Hero gets stuck on its edge, incapable of moving forward without jumping off or performing an aggravating slide during which no other action is possible. Needless to say, this doesn't bode well if there's an enemy poised to chop at you.    While we wanted so badly wanted to become immersed in the world of Gothic III, there were yet even more issues that brought us screaming back to reality. If you attack an NPC in a town you're friendly with and choose not to perform a finishing stab once they've hit the ground, they'll completely forget you attacked them even if approached only 10 seconds later. They won't even mention the fact that you just randomly beat the crap out of them, instead offering up a standard greeting. This really breaks any kind of immersive qualities about Gothic III.     We say we so badly wanted to be drawn into the provinces of Myrtana, Varant, and Nordmar because they look so good. From forest to deserts to snow-caked mountains, the world of Gothic III is a pleasure to behold. Nice lighting, grass and trees that sway in the wind, and interesting monster and beast designs function to make the world look very realistic. The layout of rocks, ruins, and caves all have a decidedly natural feel. The towns look as though they belong in the landscape, with debris littered across the ground, wear and tear evident in their stones, and structures that mirror the resources of their surrounding environments. The humanoid characters look a little cartoonish, and the orc designs are fairly standard fare, but in the face of such pretty environments they can be overlooked. The game handles far-away landscapes well, obfuscating detail in the distance with a blur effect yet leaving in all the major structures, meaning you don't get as much of the jarring pop-up evident in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. There's also no loading when entering a town or refuge, which really adds realistic tinge though that's later obliterated by the game's other problems. Character animations could have been a lot better, especially all the arm flailing during conversations, though the beasts move around fluidly. On our rig, it ran pretty well though chopped up in spots. Even with the graphics settings lowered, this game still looks really good.    In the sound category, Gothic III can be separated into two parts: soundtrack and everything else. The soundtrack is excellent, everything else is pretty bad. Like the environmental graphics, the game's orchestral soundtrack functions to draw you right in, adding a significant amount of atmosphere to your excursions through dank caves, sunny meadows, icy precipices, and sandy wastes. The tunes shift dynamically and fluidly, and never shift to something harsh on the eardrums. Voice acting and battle sounds, on the other hand, aren't so strong. Dialogue branches aren't very deep, mainly consisting of a few lines to get a quest, then a few more to trade or learn skills. There's never a real flow to any conversation, and despite the large volume of voice acting in the game, there's rarely a line that reveals any sort of real character either in the NPC or Nameless Hero. There's the occasional ~Why don't you just get the hay yourself~ or ~I'm just going to take the pay you owe~ or something like that, but most of the game's characters are flat and boring. Battle sounds are more grating, with enemies sputtering repetitive yelps of pain every time you hit them. There are also a range of ambient comments NPCs will spout while idling around, though it won't be long until you'll hear them all.With the promise of a gigantic game world within which you're free to do whatever you want, Gothic III is certainly a tantalizing title. It's got the graphical backbone to support the immersive gameplay it aims to deliver, a strong character development system, and a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, there are far too many problems with Gothic III to maintain the immersion. In a game where the illusion of a dynamic, realistic world is so crucial to the experience, technical bugs and awkward design decisions do a marvelous job at hamstringing Gothic III's gameplay. It's still possible to wander aimlessly through forests and deserts engaging whatever challenges you happen upon, which can be entertaining, but you'll never be free from the terrifically awkward combat. It doesn't help that some quests flat out don't work, the game frequently crashes, and little besides the soundtrack is worth listening to. Gothic III gives you a giant world and plenty of choice, but is ultimately engulfed by its own aspirations of complexity.", "date": "Nov 28, 2006"}
