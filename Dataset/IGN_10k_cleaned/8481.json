After two moderately interesting 'Ac!d' games that proved to be little more than tantalising hints of what was to come, Portable Ops is as legitimate and well produced as anyone could hope for a portable entry in the series. Moreover, the storyline in Portable Ops is a direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, so those looking to continue the saga are going to need to fork out for a PSP.    Snake, now sans an eyeball and sprouting hair like a gun-toting hobo, is looking sharp on Sony's handheld. Set in 1970, about six years after the events in Snake Eater, the story revolves around resentment surrounding Vietnam War. For fans of Snake Eater, you'll be thrilled to know that several characters and plot points are referenced. Para-Medic takes a more central role this time around, and a baby-faced Roy Campbell takes command of the operation.   Gene, the main antagonist in Portable Ops, is heading up a warped FOX unit. The leader is bent on the idea of birthing of a new nation by overthrowing the US and Russia, to form the mightiest, most capable military in the world. Think Sparta, only with machine guns and genetic supersoldiers. Snake (known as Naked Snake or Big Boss this time around), gets caught in the middle, after he is accused of leading the renegade FOX unit and stealing a vital national secret known as 'The Philosopher's Legacy'. Hence, the US government, the Russian military and FOX unit all want him dead. Snake needs to clear his name and take out Gene - thereby preventing a nuclear holocaust.   We're resisting the urge to joke about 'Solid Snakes', 'Naked Snakes', and 'One-eyed Snakes'. ...Wait. Sorry.  Snake starts off as a prisoner in a South American military prison. In what acts as a kind of soft-core introduction to the main skills and enemies in Portable Ops, you must break out with a malaria-suffering Roy Campbell in tow.   Although Portable Ops' story is certainly continuous, the game structure is a departure for the series. The game is now missions-based, which is a laudable design choice by the team, as it perfectly suits the portable nature of the PSP (and its inherently crummy battery life). Between missions, you're taken to a 'mission-control' style screen where you can choose your next mission location from an overhead map. It is also here that you can tool around with Portable Ops' other major shake-up of the Metal Gear formula: squad tactics.   Yes, that's correct - Portable Ops is a squad-based shooting experience. Don't think Rainbow Six, necessarily. Rather, you'll be utilising the ability to swap between playable characters at any time during the course of each mission. The idea is pretty clever - no longer must you infiltrate an enemy compound as a lone operative.    You can now knock out or drug enemy soldiers, medics and prisoners, take them back to your hideout and convert them to your cause. Thus, your numbers are bolstered in the field, and the only effective restraint on the number of captured and converted allies you have is imposed by the squad size. There are four squads to be filled out, with four slots in each (minus one for Snake, who must remain on the team). Converts each have specific roles in the field, in line with more typical squad shooters - spy, medical, technical, independent, rookie, prisoner and sneaking. The Australian version also includes two new careers - 'Bait' and 'Stuntman'. You can pretty much guess how these two classes operate.   Did you think the PSP was capable of this? Well, okay. We kind of did. But it still looks ripping-cool.  When you choose a mission, an introductory cutscene is triggered (which an impatient few will no doubt hate, despite the great production values and score) and you're placed into the field. At this point, you can pause the game and swap between other soldiers in your squad. Some might be better suited to different tasks, while others make inherently better spies, thanks to matching uniforms for the particular installation you're infiltrating, for instance.   It's not a gameplay revelation - the Metal Gear Solid credo of 'Tactical Espionage Action' is strictly adhered to. You'll be doing a lot of sneaking, killing and evading in the tradition of past entries. However, new characters add a fresh dimension to the gameplay that not even the inherently strategic Ac!d games managed to nail with this degree of fun and success.    On the Briefing Menu, you can also dabble in a bit of micromanagement. Each squad member's rank and statistics are tracked, and these are all performance based stats, too; it is wholly possible to stick with a handful of characters and 'grow' them into fully-fledged bad-asses.    Then again, you can also use the PSP's built-in Wi-Fi to search for other PSP-owning MGS: Portable Ops players. By detecting their frequency, your PSP can receive troops automatically while in sleep mode, or actively if you're feeling social. The idea is, by using Wi-Fi hotspots, you can play a micro-game that seeks out 'signals' of characters around the world that can be brought into your team. Generally, the weaker the signal, the stronger the character.    Despite being the bane of every PSP owner's existence, the controls are relatively well-mapped, and the sensitivity of the joy-nub is thankfully adjustable. Triangle is your wall-press and general activation button. As in previous games, just approach a flat surface and hold down triangle to press against it. However, we found that Snake's angle of approach must be pretty dead-on in order to get the game to recognise the move input.   Holding down square draws your pistol or other equipped device. Simple. Of course, without the PS2's analogue buttons, you can no longer ease off the trigger. It's a little too easy to crack off a shot and alert the guards, who won't take too kindly to your presence.    A sound-based radar system is a cool, if kind of impractical, addition to the HUD. Enemies are identified through colours and vague locations, while a circular waveform table vibrates around the outside edge of the radar, indicating footfalls, gunfire and general character movement. Snake's sound is also tracked by a waveform ring on the inside of the radar, so taking advantage of the triangle-button's 'sneaky-walk' function is a must.   As with every main-line Metal Gear game since Solid on the PSone, Hideo Kojima's development team has injected heretofore unimaginable production values into the title. The PSP isn't quite up to scratch with the PS2, but you'll wonder how the heck the team managed to pull off these kinds of effects when so many other studios barely make do with overly-filtered and horridly blurry textures, low-detail models and effect-free environments.   The squad management screen. It's as complex as it looks.   The engine from Snake Eater has been mostly reproduced on the portable - which is quite a feat in itself. A few concessions were made, the textures on buildings and surfaces, while markedly better than most other games, do take a hit. But the animations are flawless, explosions look fantastic and even atmospheric effects look subtle and on-par with anything the PS2 can do. As a sum of its parts, Portable Ops is a remarkably grand looking game.   Cutscenes are hand-drawn and inked in appearance, with moments of speedy, Flash-like animation breaking up what is otherwise a frame-by-frame storyboard or graphic novel telling. It's a minor point of personal taste, but the quality of the illustrations isn't quite on par with the masterful work done by MGS-regular Yoji Shinkawa; instead, Ashley Wood, who penned the online graphic novel, also illustrates these sequences.   While Harry Gregson-Williams didn't compose the score this time around, the in-house soundtrack is every bit as good. Frankly, if you didn't know it wasn't Gregson-Williams, you'd never guess, either. Voice acting and sound production also shine. Small details, like the sound of tyres over gravel, engines idling and footfalls in the distance are reproduced with stunning quality. David Hayter reprises his role as Snake and he injects a lot of personality into a mostly rock-solid script (and translation).   A lot of effort also went into fleshing out the multiplayer modes in Portable Ops. While on the surface, the standard deathmatch experience might not blow your proverbial skirt up, try introducing some of the squad troops you've acquired in the single player game. It adds a new and very competitive element to the online shooter-fest.    Taking advantage of squad mechanics adds new depth to the classic core gameplay.  As much as we love Portable Ops, it's not a perfect game. The menus are definitely a little convoluted - finding and swapping out squad members can be fiddly, and the tiny text font is going to toy with your corneas. On the more overt gameplay front, the AI is definitely a little shoddy and inconsistent. You can gain the attention of the guards and blow up an oil drum, but the resulting thunderous boom and engulfing fireball won't be enough to distract them from pursuing you. You can also knock out a guard standing behind a group and oddly, the other troops think nothing of their fellow officer taking a nosedive into the cement for a quick nap. Maybe narcolepsy is a common ailment in high-pressure workplaces, or the dreaded tsetse fly is back in season. Who knows.   Elsewhere, it isn't possible to press up against walls when crouching. Instead, you must crouch or crawl to stay concealed behind waist-high crates and walls. This is particularly annoying since the control scheme should easily cater for this movement in the same way that it does when Snake is standing upright. Camera movement is limited in the single player (though, moveable in multiplayer via the D-pad) and you can't move the camera when peeking around corners, due to the lack of a second analogue nub. This can make getting a usable angle tricky during tense moments or heavy fire fights.    Back onto brighter things - for Australian and European gamers, Konami have added a few extra sweeteners that might tip the scales in Portable Ops' favour. Like past PAL versions of the MGS games, a Boss Attack mode has been added. In here, you can face off against any boss you've encountered in the main game, one after the other. Elsewhere, two more multiplayer maps were added to the roster, bumping the total up to ten. It's always great to see developers sweetening the deal a little to make up for a five month wait.Apart from these issues, however, Portable Ops shines. Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops is absolutely essential for fans of the series and well worth a look for newbies. It's a terrific entry into the series that absolutely retains the unmistakable Metal Gear gameplay, characterisation, attitudes and twists that have deservingly earned Snake a following that most Hollywood action stars would be jealous of.", "date": "May 17, 2007"}
