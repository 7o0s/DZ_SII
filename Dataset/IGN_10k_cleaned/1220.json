But then, did anybody? The original Saturday Night Live skits and classic 1980 movie spin-off were enough for us. The question is, do you have to be a fan of the shows to appreciate Blues Brothers 2000 for the N64? Certainly not, but of course it couldn't really hurt, either.  If you're a platform gaming junkie then chances are you've already seen this game before, just never this simple. Titus Entertainment, the now infamous publisher behind such spectacular flops as Superman and Carmageddon 64, attempts to join Mario, Banjo, Rayman, and gang in the N64 platform lineup. The good news for Titus is that our expectations are already low for this title, so let's see if it can at least meet some of them this time around.  Features  1 or 2 players Colorful 3-D platforming action mixed with rhythm action gameplay Play as a cartoon Elwood in a cartoon world Four worlds with multiple areas and objectives Full movie license Classic licensed tunes Save data via Controller Pak Rumble Pak support   Story Despite never having seen the movie, it appears the storyline remains close to its celluloid predecessor. It begins in present day America, and your name is Elwood Blues. You've just been released from a six-year stretch of hard time in prison, and naturally you're on a mission from God: get the band back together. If you're a fan of the original movie and this plot sounds suspiciously familiar, that's because it is. Back in the day Elwood and his brother Jake caused quite a stir trying to raise some money at the Battle of the Bands, and poor Elwood ended up in the slammer.  Well, it's time to shed those stripes and round up the boys for another zany musical adventure. You take control of Elwood and must guide him through four stages: Joliet State Prison, Chicago, The Spooky Graveyard, and The Swamp. In each of the first three levels you must find one of your lost band member buddies: Buster, 'Mighty' Mac, and Cab. The final swamp level will bring the entire gang to the Battle of the Bands where you'll have the final showdown. Not quite the most emotionally gripping plot, but hey -- it's about as good a reason to play as ~saving the princess~ we suppose.  Gameplay When we said that you might have already seen this game before, we weren't joking. Blues Brothers 2000 attempts to please not by innovating, but rather by imitating. From Super Mario 64 alone we can find dozens of gameplay similarities. If Elwood snags 100 coins, he'll get a 1up. If you repeatedly press the B button he'll punch, punch, then kick. He can do a backflip and even do a butt-stomp from the air using the Z-trigger. And let's not forget about the camera system -- identical in design yet lacking in usefulness.  But why stop there when there are so many other great games to borrow from? Okay, how about we throw in a multiple item collection system where the player must find very standard items such as coins, notes, and musical instruments on each level. Banjo-Kazooie anyone? Now let's toss in some Parappa the Rapper to add that necessary musical flare. That's right, you'll be doing the same rhythm action button tapping as Bust a Grove for PSX while Elwood himself grooves along to the tunes (although this is done poorly and is typically out of beat with the music). But our favorite outside inspiration has to be from none other than Metal Gear Solid. When you alert certain enemies to your presence, you'll be sure to notice the infamous ~!~ shooting right out of their heads as they get all agitated on you. Admittedly, our first reaction was to whip out my silenced SOCOM pistol and paint a laser dot on the big ugly thug's forehead, but alas, no such weapons in this game.  As mentioned, Elwood's moves are standard platform stuff. The B-button punches, A-button jumps, and the C-buttons allow you to control your camera the exact same way Mario and Banjo did. It must be said that the camera system in Blues Brothers 2000 is quite frustrating and not implemented nearly as well as the preceding titles. No matter how many times you zoom out for a wide view of the action, it always seems to zoom back in as much as possible for no apparent reason. A frequently used feature such as centering the camera behind the player is achieved by the awkward combination of the Z and C-down buttons pressed simultaneously. I'd say that half of the input we gave the controller was entirely for camera manipulation alone -- not the best way to play a game.  Other player moves include the standard mid-air ~Butt Bounce~ and ~Dive Roll,~ along with the new ~Head Spin~ and ~Hat Throw~ to defend against the encountered foes. Despite their borrowed nature, having a wide variety of moves at your disposal is always a good thing and Elwood will probably make use of them all during the game (while you're not controlling the camera, of course). The play control is actually very tight and responsive. It makes running the funny little man in circles a simple and enjoyable task. Veteran gamers might find it to be almost too good, but this game appears to be more likely to please the younger and inexperienced crowd and thus it handles appropriately.  Even further indication of the targeted age for this game is found in the level designs. All stages are straightforward and very basic. They're practically linear in objectives with no real puzzles to speak of. You'll find yourself running the only direction you can possibly go to find a wrench, then backtrack to the sewer hatch you passed and continue on in that direction. There is very little room to get lost in this game, despite how large and open the levels appear at first glance. Another help to the younger gamer will be the ~Gold Records~ located rather generously throughout the stages to offer tips on controlling Elwood, clearing areas, and defeating enemies.  Blues Brothers 2000 will not give most gamers a very long ride, either. After barely an hour of gameplay we were already cruising past the halfway point of the game. Perhaps the perfect length for a 2-day rental, but otherwise it's just ridiculously short unless you're brand new to the world of videogames. You also have the ability to save your progress during the game whenever your attention span has reached its peak. But really it's just a novelty as you could probably sit down and beat the game straight through. Speaking of novelties, the multiplayer game is a weak attempt to attach the word ~multiplayer~ to the title. It's the same rhythm action game from the one-player quest but instead has two players compete simultaneously. And since it was never really that great in the one player portion of the game, it pretty much drips along the same way here.  Now despite the fact that this game is based on a familiar movie license, you can expect some wacky and downright odd encounters as you venture along the path. I'm pretty sure the movie didn't have any electrified zombies walking past the camera in the prison scene. Even in this game it just appears way out of place to run past a few cells, a guard, and then see -- an electrified zombie? The cartoon presentation plays it off, but it just seems like there are too many weird choices of enemies (just for the sake of having enemies) throughout the entire game. You'll find large angry men wandering the sewer systems carrying hatchets, or our personal favorite: the random woman on the street corner who will pummel you with her purse without so much as a polite word first. The first time we saw her we were expecting some kind of conversation out of the sweet looking gal, but instead we lost some health and were forced to knock her out. Most odd.  Graphics After having just witnessed the visually horrifying Carmageddon 64, we were not expecting much from the latest Titus cart. And it's a good thing, too -- this game is definitely no competition for Rare's Banjo-Kazooie in the graphics department. Developer Player 1 has done some nice things with the color choices and character designs throughout the game, but a few shortcomings keep this game from looking like a winner.  It's odd really, for some of the areas in Blues Brothers 2000 feature surprisingly crisp, blended texture layout. Nothing quite BK (or, for that matter, even DK64) quality, mind you, but not to shabby nonetheless.  And other areas are hampered by just the opposite. Every wall, door, car, tree, sky, etc. are smeared with fuzzy images that will leave you questioning your eyesight in due time. Another major eyesore is in the design of the object models -- or lack thereof. Perhaps the level design was just too ambitious to accommodate enough polygon action, but some models in this world are just way too simple. Every trash dumpster or doghouse consists of the bare minimum four or five polygons to render the object. Slap a lackluster texture on top of that and you've got yourself one really annoying, ummm, box.  Despite the lack of wonderful graphics, it must be said that given the nature of the game it seems to work all right. Younger gamers will never notice the toned-down look, and the pretty colors will keep them happy the whole way through. They don't lend a lot to the game, but they're simple and effective. The character animations are also done fairly well and should slap a smile on just about any kid with a funny bone for slapstick humor.  Sound As perhaps the strongest point of the game, the sound tends to bring out the cartoon loving kid in us all. If Elwood falls from a ledge, he will splat on the ground and you'll hear a nice ~Blurp!~ to let you know he's not seriously wounded. Punching enemies will give you a ~Biff!~ or ~Boink!~ and are very satisfying to hear. All the effects come out clean and crisp and fit the style of the game perfectly. You'll also find that there are many different layers of audio running during the action. For example, in the Chicago stage you can hear a track of just wind blowing through the city, then on top of that you'll hear traffic and sirens floating by, then the music, and finally the gameplay effects. Not too shabby, really.  Even better than the sound effects is the great use of licensed music throughout the game. We're talkin' classic hits like Otis Redding's ~Respect~ and even a contemporary ditty from John Popper of ~Blues Traveler~ fame. They're not the original recordings, rather midi renditions that are easier to accommodate on the size-permitting N64 cartridges. All together you'll find about five or six great tunes to keep your fingers snapping as you whiz through the game. When it's all said and done, Blues Brothers 2000 is not a horrible game. Generic perhaps, but not horrible. Titus seems determined to bring itself out of the pit of shame it's been lounging in for some time now. This game is indeed a step in the right direction, but is by no means better than half of the platform games in the already crowded N64 genre. If you are new to the system and would like a simple and amusing introduction to the world of 3D gaming, then maybe give this one a rent. Otherwise, I'd steer clear this holiday season when it finally ships to retailers and stick to the other surefire hits (*ahem* Banjo-Tooie *ahem*) to fill your future platforming needs.", "date": "Sep 6, 2000"}
