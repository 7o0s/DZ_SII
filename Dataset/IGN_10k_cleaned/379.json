In the case of Ballistic, it takes its idea more from Bust-A-Move than Tetris, but it isn't quite as tightly designed as Bust-A-Move that would make it as much a household name. Features  Three modes of play Link cable support for two player action For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   The idea in Ballistic is extremely simple -- you fire colored balls from the middle of the playing field at a constantly flowing chain of colored balls. When you link three balls together, they disappear and the rest of the link slides backward. If the balls link together when sliding backward, it'll cause a chain reaction. If the chain of balls reach the goal line, the game's over.  Like most of these ~chain reaction~ games, the strategy is all about the set-up so you can wipe out an entire sequence of balls in one shot. But this is extremely the case of Ballistic, since you really can't succeed in the game without learning how to put balls in the right order to create these chain reactions. And when you connect two systems together for VS. action, that's the only way you're going to win -- you can't get lucky by pecking away at the chain of balls, you have to eliminate a bunch in one shot.  The Panic mode is like the ~marathon mode~ in Tetris -- to see how long you can last as the chain increases in speed. Checkmate mode is a lot of fun -- there are fifty predetermined puzzles to solve, and you only have a set amount of balls to use. If you can completely wipe out the chain, you win and move onto the next puzzle. This mode really tests your mind and patience, and makes you think five moves ahead. Panic mode is fine, but I found myself playing Checkmate a lot more.  But there's one element I never quite figured out -- most of the time the chain slides backward when you clear out a link of three balls, but sometimes it stays put and leaves a gap. Why? This isn't covered in the instruction manual, and it's just not obvious why it happens.  It's not easy pushing as many sprites on-screen on the Game Boy system, so the game doesn't flow as smoothly as the PlayStation counterpart (in fact, the Game Boy has to pull off an interlacing trick to show all the bubbles moving, which is why the screenshot to the right shows only half the balls). But as a Game Boy game goes, it looks fine -- somewhat sterile, but acceptable. It makes you wonder how good the game would have looked if Mitchell programmed the title exclusively for the Game Boy Color.  Ballistic is a nicely-designed puzzle game on the Game Boy system, but in terms of interface it kind of lacks the flair. The music is absolutely the worst, but you can turn that off, and it doesn't take that much away from the overall feel of the game. You'll probably find yourself playing Checkmate more than the Panic mode, which is not the usual fare for these action-puzzlers. Bust-A-Move is a little better in design, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't make room for Ballistic.", "date": "Nov 6, 1999"}
