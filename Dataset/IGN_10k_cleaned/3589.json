A sequel to Volition's popular and aptly named futuristic first-person shooter, Red Faction, RF II drops the wickedly original Mars mining revolt theme and instead focuses on a more stereotypical, videogame cliched military action against a tyrannical dictator with some super technology in his pocket theme. Throw in betrayal, vastly improved visuals over the original (for the console that popularized the jaggy, anyway), and a lot of explosions and THQ had an instant Volition made winner on its hand, probably why the title was so well-received by the Sony loving community.   Now, Red Faction II is out on PC, a few months past due and few years behind the technological times. Can THQ, Volition, and Outrage offer enough newness and coolness to validate the long wait and justify the down and dirty port?  Well, while RF II is a fun FPS with engaging combat and excellent pacing, it simply does not compete when it comes to graphics, plot delivery, presentation or longevity.    A freaky man-robot named Capek created nanotechnology on Mars, under the employment of the ruthless Ultor corporation and within the relative safety of one of its many mining facilities, until it and he along with it, were crushed by disgruntled miners. That technology was stolen and re-stolen and stolen again until it finally fell into the possession of the Commonwealth, specifically into the iron grip of Sopot, its deity-like ruler. This fascist dictator's oppression is pissing off a splinter cell of rebellious citizens. Dubbing themselves the Red Faction (not at all coincidentally the same name Ultor rebels stitched onto their suits), they seek to overthrow Sopot and bring the Commonwealth into an age of enlightenment, peace, and free elections. To this end, they enlist a group of nanotechnology enhanced super-humans who happened to find themselves on Sopot's blacklist after they became too powerful and too dangerous for their own good.  You're Alias, a demolitions expert and one of the six remaining enhanced killing machines Sopot hasn't yet been able to slaughter. Red Faction II is fast and it's definitely a shooter, so you're not going to be weighing gunpowder to figure out how high you need something to blow. Truly, if you can only praise one thing about Red Faction II and only one thing, it'd be the pacing. The entire first half of the game is dedicated to hunting down Sopot and destroying him. Ransack buildings, engage in frantic firefights high up in the clouds, invade a missile silo, rampage through the streets in tanks and mechanized armor, and just plain shoot a whole lot. Oh yeah. Interestingly, the massive battle and flowing chase ultimately lead up to a face-to-face confrontation with Sopot that ends without a single shot having to be fired, which I believe works appropriately, since the dictator himself is not a genetically engineered soldier, but rather a insane, loudmouthed puss. Just when you think it's over and you've wasted your cash on a short game, the second half kicks in with a bit of classic and predictable betrayal. Now you're the hunted. The game is still short, by the way.  As you can tell, the story is also a little thinner than the original's. The idea of workers in revolt was an unusual concept for a videogame, and it was executed very well, especially taking into account the backstory sequences that Volition provided to set things up. Red Faction II, in comparison, is a more typical military mission, livened only by a nifty if predictable plot twist about a third of the way through. The dialogue could use a spot of editing here and there, and neither the ostensible villain nor the actual villain are very effective at inspiring a personal desire to whack them.   One character's treatment does show some creativity, though. That's Echo, the leader of the new Red Faction. A limp-wristed missing link between a left-wing political party and an actual rebellion, he plays a very entertaining straight-man to the hard-bitten soldiers of the rebel squad. It's a pity he leaves the game partway through, since his departure means no more jokes at his expense.   Regardless, the game does change in the middle. Blending both the predator and prey styles of play into one game works. Unfortunately, While Red Faction II certainly seems like a game that wants to tell a grandiose story (it even enlists a series of professional actors to help achieve this goal), the script and the way it progresses just isn't enveloping enough or soaked with enough backstory to be truly believable. The twist midway through the game doesn't have any impact on the game itself, because prior to that, nothing has occurred to vie gamers any real interest in investing in the pivotal characters. The world environment, the feeling of oppression and rebellion, seems a perfect backdrop for telling an interesting story, but someone dropped the ball. There's an attempt, but it's a hollow one at that winds up delivering a shoot everyone and walk in a relatively straight line shooter, which isn't necessarily bad, provided certain other areas are developed enough.      What RF II does incredibly well is make for an easy pick-up-and play experience.  The controls are about as stripped down and simple as possible for a first-person shooter. There is no lean and there is no walk or run, but there are fire, alternate fire and dedicated grenade buttons, meaning it's all about the combat. Your focus is on killing baddies, and the controls allow for that, but nothing more.  Filled with action and intent on keeping players fighting, level progression is one area where the game occasionally hangs up. For the most part, the level scripting and event triggers do a fine job of pushing the player forward, but every so often there's a point where the game doesn't offer quite enough of a cue towards the next path. Unfortunately, these also seem to frequently coincide with spots where enemies continuously spawn, so you have to waste ammo fending off a continuous wave of thugs while trying to get your mind around where to go next. Worst of all are one or two points where the enemies in question are the suicidal Minority Report spider-bots. These enemies, I think, we could do without -- they're too small and fast-moving to effectively defend against, even if you have excellent reflexes. And they explode when they hit you.  Another question about the enemy design arises in the later stages of the game. Early on, you fight against human soldiers and guards, who behave quite realistically and present a decent challenge with their movements. They're smart enough to duck behind cover, run when wounded, throw back grenades, and so on. In later levels, though, they're increasingly replaced by the ~processed~ -- nano-enhanced zombie soldiers that make up the core of Sopot's army. The overall challenge level doesn't change much, since the processed soldiers take more damage before going down, but they aren't nearly as interesting to fight as the human soldiers. The processed just keep coming in a straight line, making their silly groaning zombie noises until you pop their heads open.   Popping is still fun, though. Perhaps the coolest way to pop is by taking out two pistols or two sub-machineguns and firing them simultaneously -- primary fire ignites one and secondary the other. This allows you to have continuous fire even while one of your guns is recoiling or reloading.  Plus, it's pretty darn enjoyable until you get shot a whole lot.  Health is somewhat different from other games. There's a life bar, but then you have three medical kits. When one bar is whittled down, you automatically use a medkit to fully heal. Remember, you can only hold only three medkits at any given time. Still, on medium difficulty, dying really isn't going to be a problem throughout the majority of the game. You'll get clipped by a turret you didn't see and some of the boss fights will give you grief, but it's nothing to cry about. And even if you do die, you'll be kicked back to the last load section. Here's where it gets goofy. There is no quick save! Furthermore, unless my copy is functioning improperly or I am doing something horribly wrong, manually saving does absolutely nothing other than resaving the last load point. So, if I manually save at the end of a section and load, I'll still be at the beginning of the load point. When I said down and dirty port, I meant down and dirty, no frills, only the absolute minimum. There are lots of load sections and the game is fairly easy throughout, so the lacking save functionality, while a problem, isn't an infuriating problem. As a quick, related note, the game plays out in a Half-Life continuously progressing manner, and each load point is remarkably shorter than the console versions (even the Xbox) to the point where the tip text displayed breezes by so fast it's unreadable. Cheers for that.   There are moments during RF II where you must take control of vehicles in on-rails and fully controllable fashions. You'll man the guns of a chopper, ride a tank through town, walk the streets in robust battle armor, and submerge beneath the seas in a submarine. The controls for each of these is almost identical to on-foot control, so the transition is seamless. It almost feels like the vehicle modes are just an extension of the run and gun modes, which is exactly how it should be. It should be known that this sequel does limit the interactivity of the vehicles, though.  Only two of the vehicles are fully controllable -- the battle armor and the mini-sub -- while the tank and gunship sequences only offer control over weapon direction. Nevertheless, all the vehicle-based sections of the game offer a welcome change from running around on foot. In particular, the battle armor is a riot -- the twin machineguns, explosive missiles, and incendiary grenades are almost an embarrassment of riches. It's still a relatively straight line we're talking about here, so don't hear vehicles and think Battlefield.  Levels in Red Faction II are linear, but there are lots of short offshoots where you can complete tertiary objectives that will reward you with heroics that will in-turn, alter the game's final ending (slaughtering civvies has a negative effect; finding bonuses and doing no wrong has a positive effect). There are few points in the game where you'll need to question where to go, because there's generally only a single path to follow, but you will need to figure out how to go from point A to point B, which usually involves shooting through a cleverly, yet clearly marked off wall or ceiling or floor. All offshoots either come to a dead end after you've completed the objective or rejoin the main path shortly thereafter. Don't forget to watch for those spider drones.      There's nothing wrong with being linear, but in light of many of the FPS titles out today, which have a main pathway but plenty of places for exploration and offer lots of different access points, RF II feels a bit limiting, particularly when commanding a vehicle.  The level design itself is still pretty good, and, as mentioned, the pacing keeps the action to the point and engrossing, but less corridors and more office space exploration could have helped immensely.    Thanks to Volition's Geo-Mod technology, some of these lines between A and B can be destroyed, while everything else will exhibit classic decal scorch marks and whatnot. Of course, not everything is destructible, and often times it's a bit confounding as to why certain walls are, while others are not. Why the hell isn't that tree busting apart or that light breaking? It's a half-way improvement to the genre, which could have been done better. I can understand the need to preserve level design, but often, and quite coolly, Red Faction II has destructible walls that are only destructible to a limit (something impenetrable like girders may rest a few feet beneath the surface). Well, why not have this everywhere? Admittedly, the game still offers many more opportunities for random destruction than the average first-person shooter.   Red Faction weighted its emphasis on the Geo-Mod concept rather unevenly -- it was a significant factor in the early going, but after a certain point it completely disappeared. In Red Faction II, it's more evenly spread throughout the game, although it's never as heavily used as it was in parts of Red Faction. Applications run from the mundane to the clever. There's plenty of basic ~blow through this wall to grab the widget on the other side,~ but every so often you get something fun, like blasting chunks out of a concrete overpass to raise the available height clearance for a vehicle.   Also, while walls and whatnot can be busted, a lot of environmental objects either explode or do nothing. After playing through Devastation, I've become spoiled on an environment littered with objects begging to be manipulated. More physics and less clouds of smoke, please. I'm still envisioning a game world as rich and beautiful as Devastation's, with as much clutter, litter, and crap to shoot, only thrown into a directed, slyly designed action title like Red Faction II (sporting Geo-Mod, of course).  For combat, walls can be busted to access certain enemies (which a few weapons even play on) and numerous other objects can be exploded to reveal secrets paths, which generally lead to extra ammo or health.  But you have to be careful where you shoot, because innocent civilians are sprinkled throughout each level.  Remember, kill an innocent and your 'heroic' meter takes a ding.    Even though your heroic level determines whether you receive the good or bad ending, it doesn't affect any other aspect of the game. Perhaps if being heroic meant you had better luck at finding helpful items or that you got a slight power boost, or perhaps even got better assistance from your teammates, it would have added more dynamic gameplay. As it is, Red Faction II is a bit too straight-forward for its own good.  Straightforward or not, I do dig the combat quite a bit, especially on harder difficulty settings. Unless scripted otherwise, everyone in Red Faction II is ready for a fight, so when you cap a goon or approach a thug, or walk into a battle between goons and thugs, get ready to shoot. Sometimes it's superb. Guys will duck behind crates, pop out from behind walls, run when shot, be ~scared~ into regrouping, spread out, encircle you if you're behind cover, take out your cover if it's destructible, and will even run when a grenade is thrown if they don't lob one right back at you. Sometimes the artificial intelligence is a bit too inactive. In these rarer instances, it's possible to witness them standing still and absorbing a full clip of death. Still, the pacing is great, the placement of enemies throughout the levels and the way in which they react to their levels is very tight, and it all has the almost unquantifiable ~correct feel~ to it. Then the zombie mutants come out. Peachy.  On top of the voluntary, random bits of environment interaction and constant combat, the levels are heavily scripted, with a substantial supporting cast and plenty of unexpected events to liven things up. Several different AI-controlled sidekicks fight alongside you at different points in the game, providing well-balanced contributions that help without hindering, and a host of bit players appear to pitch in, require rescuing, or otherwise take part in one of the many secondary objectives. They're also not pushovers like the Red Faction in the original game that died within the first three seconds of appearing.  It's too hard to discount how much fun these friends and enemies can be to toy with from time to time. Shoot an incendiary grenade into a crowd of baddies or Faction members and listen to them scream; then, watch 'em run around a good bit, flailing their arms because, apparently in their army no one ever taught them the value of ~stop, drop, and roll.~ Take it a step further and slap a satchel charge on someone and see him run panicking to his mates urging them to disarm it before he explodes. It's quite entertaining.      Any game can overcome problems with linearity and a ~been there, done that~ feel if it's fun. And that's Red Faction II's saving grace. The single-player action is a lot of fun. It sports an average engine with a technological gimmick that has yet to truly expand play or engulf gamers in an entirely destructible world, but it's a blast to play, if not quite up to the standards of the newest generation of first-person shooters. Solo play is relatively easy and incredibly short, though. A solid day or two of play and you'll be done with it. It's just not compelling enough to play through multiple times, which puts a heavy burden on a multiplayer mode that simply does not exist.  Baffling is the only way I can describe it. The potential for Red Faction II multiplayer on the PC, complete with vehicles (even if on-rails a la Black Hawk Down) is staggering. Yet here we are, looking at a simple, stupid, and only passably enjoyable botmatch, even though modes, functionality and geo-modding are in place to deliver the multiplayer experience to beat. Red Faction had multiplayer! Outrage and Volition, companies that were originally Parallax, had PXO, one of the best services of its time! What the hell is this all about? It's simply unacceptable. No multiplayer...? Insanity, just like the complete lack of visual improvements.  Aesthetically, Red Faction II looks better than the PS2, Xbox and GameCube iterations, but it just isn't anything special. Higher resolutions and somewhat cleaner textures do not mean better textures and superior graphics. It runs well, but there are areas, especially around water, where the textures get completely washed out and the game looks far from phenomenal. It simply lacks crisp, contrasting, deep blacks, advanced effects like swaying lights and excessive bump-mapping and pixel shading. And, although the character animations are very solid, there is no glorious ragdoll physics system at all. Add to this sometimes technically lacking gun models, blurry character models, and strangely bland environments and it just isn't the prettiest thing around, despite wicked level design, cool art, and the ability to burst a wall.   However, kudos to the fantastic death animations and the vivid explosions. If only the guns looked a bit more impressive in your hands, the colors were a bit richer, and the textures a bit more detailed. If only. Not a bad looking game at all, but up against PC titles from 2002 till now, it's just not jaw-dropping until you hear it, anyway.  What did you think of Red Faction II?  Like Red Faction, Red Faction II boasts some truly awesome sound effects. Guns, when fired, just feel damn right. Ricochets will rattle you, the assault rifles will pump you, the diverse amount of screams and enemy quips will get you running, and the rumbling of fire and explosions are good. I wouldn't say Red Faction II beats out Allied Assault, or in some ways even Double Helix, but it sounds damn good.  The score, often just hides in the background of the sound field, and is mostly techno beats the likes of the original Terminator movie.  It doesn't contrast the game's style, but it seems fairly ordinary, with no pleasant surprises to offer. In fact, I do believe many of the tunes I'm hearing are straight out of the original Red Faction. What's up with that?   Red Faction II is fun, certainly, but single-player is a bit too linear and bit too short, even if the combat is engaging, well-thought out, and generally intense. Since this really isn't a game to buy if you are only planning on playing it solo to finish the campaign (given its brevity), and since weak botmatches are hardly enough to hold interest for long amounts of time, you really have to take a step back and look at the game and whether or not you want to continually play it. It's very sad to see such failed potential. Given higher production values, tweaked and improved graphics and a freaking multiplayer mode, Red Faction II could have really been something to dig. Unfortunately, it simply has too little going for it to stack up against the endless waves of PC first-person shooters that trounce the title in so many other ways. So, it relies solely on its decent combat system and its geo-modding technology to achieve a well-rounded kind of decency that could have been so much more.", "date": "Apr 10, 2003"}
