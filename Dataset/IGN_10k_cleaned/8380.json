The sequel to 1979's Galaxian, Galaga, which also spawned several sequels of its own, is an intense space shooter.  Ported to a bounty of consoles, from the Atari 7800 to Xbox360, it is likely due to some act of divine intervention if you have yet to play this game.  From the so-called Golden Age of Arcade Games, Galaga still enjoys widespread popularity today amongst vintage, rebuilt, and replica coin-operated machines.  Now Wii owners have a chance to jump into the action by throwing down 500 points for this classic.   Players control a laterally moving ship in an effort to destroy the insect-like enemies that incessantly swarm to attack, using missiles - or themselves - as ammunition.  What sets this shooter apart from others is the propensity for the aliens to attack in formation.  While this sometimes makes their trajectories predictable, more often than not the player will be frantically moving from side to side in an effort to avoid the maelstrom of fire.            While some players may be tempted to simply mash the fire button, this adversely affects the score, as an accuracy bonus is awarded at the end of each level.  Since the game has an infinite number of levels, the accuracy bonuses become crucial in achieving the coveted highest score.     Getting a serious number of points takes some serious dedication, but a basic strategy to employ is to allow the boss Galaga to ~capture~ the player's ship in its tractor beam, so long as the player has at least one extra life. The captured ship can be freed by destroying the boss Galaga, and the result is the fusion of the captured ship to the current one.  Now the player is a target twice as wide, but more importantly, twice as powerful. Unfortunately, there is no way to have another ship captured and subsequently relinquished to gain a ~triple ship~.      Galaga is very addictive and will undoubtedly suck precious hours out of your life, which you could probably better devote to playing catch with Timmy or showing little Sally how to clean the gutters.  Nevertheless, chances are Timmy will be throwing against the wall and Sally will be falling off the roof.  It is quite difficult to stop playing once you have started.  Being almost three decades old, though, the game definitely shows its age graphically and aurally, but the gameplay never disappoints.  For any fan of vintage space-shooting action, downloading Galaga for 500 Wii points is a no-brainer  that is, if you don't have the game in some form or another already.  Like other Virtual Console games, Galaga is available in other collections, making the $5 price a bit of a turnoff.  What's most disappointing is how Nintendo still doesn't take the time to implement minor changes into their Virtual Console releases, such as the online scoreboard offered on Xbox Live.  However, the game is a faithful port from its NES incarnation, and for that, it can be lauded.", "date": "Apr 18, 2007"}
