All it was in design was two tanks, head to head, trying to score as many ~kills~ as possible before the time runs out. The only graphics to speak of were generic blocks representing obstacles, and two tanks in an overhead perspective. And as basic as the game was, it offered intense challenge against another player because it required a lot of maneuvering and positioning to get at the other person.   I mention this simply for this reason: more than 20 years later, Combat whips the pants off a similar game that's probably spent longer in development on a more powerful system: 3DO's WDL: Thunder Tanks. Features 12 characters and tanks Seven arenas  20 different weapons Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Oh, Thunder Tanks starts off promising enough  12 tanks of pure destruction, out in an enclosed arena out to be the last man standing. Obstacles, such as bystander vehicles and huge buildings, can be crushed and obliterated to make shortcuts easy to plow through. Power-ups can be snagged by blasting poor defenseless structures, and by doing so, increasing the firepower of your armored vehicle.  But you know what? That paragraph up there explains the entire context of Thunder Tanks. The game's broken into missions of destruction, but there's absolutely no variety to the action  it all just boils down to finding all the enemy tanks and destroying them until there's no one left. What's more, the game lacks any real technique  all the ~battling~ is done head-to-head. Your tank has much stronger armor than the computer AI opponents, so 99% of the time you're just driving straight into weapon blasts with your own guns blazing. It gets seriously boring early on, because you get absolutely zero sense that you should play conservatively to spare your Thunder Tanks in reserve.  Graphically, the game does its job. In fact, it goes above and beyond in some places  you've never seen so many ~destroyable~ objects in a Game Boy Color game. Massive buildings will disappear into a pile of rubble, a nifty trick that's not used all that much on the hardware. But this effect must take its toll on the rest of the game, because the flow isn't exactly ~smooth.~ The game slows down a bunch when more than two tanks get on the screen.  I think the most disappointing aspect of Thunder Tanks is its lack of link cable support. I know for a fact that this was a feature planned early on, and for whatever reason the multiplayer support was pulled from the production version. This could have been an option that may have saved the game from Mediocreville  but instead, the absence of the feature does nothing but draw attention to its already-shallow gameplay.  The game had lots of promise, but ultimately the not-so-deep level design and technique-lacking gameplay erases the fun WDL: Thunder Tanks could have had. The original Battletanx on the Game Boy Color promised a lot less and actually ended up a somewhat fun game  this ~sequel~ does one-up the graphic quality, but does nothing to increase the excitement.", "date": "Feb 13, 2001"}
