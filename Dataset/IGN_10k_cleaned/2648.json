The recluse owns a mansion, loves his mute and neurotic niece with a troubled and mysterious past, and wants to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock by making a film in his backyard (a film he insists on sharing absolutely nothing about with his crew). A normal everyday guy to be sure, but Robert has been having some problems of late. His film crew has gone missing, apparently in the ~been brutally murdered~ kind of way.  Joseph Shamley is a private detective with psychic powers, the crappy uncontrollable kind that developed when his folks died in a car accident at Hitchcock's funeral and now only come in flashes and tell absolutely nothing of relevance. Psycho mute (the niece, Alicia) comes to Shamley requesting his powers of deduction in solving this mystery, but he's off to fish. So to get his attention she crashes her car into his on the interstate (coincidentally near her own home) and off to the spooky Bates-esque mansion they go. Unlike Norman's abode, this creepy palace overlooks a movie set, the one with all the killings a happening.  And so begins Hitchock: The Final Cut the latest in the craze of videogames trying desperately to desecrate the memory of other, better things.  An item collecting and puzzle solving 3D character on 2D backdrop adventure to the core, Final Cut still stubbornly insists on playing as if it wants to be a 'survival horror' actioner. Keyboard controls movement and Joseph can, of all things, jump and sidestep; mouse control only comes into play in menus and examine situations. When the view switches to allow close inspection of areas of relevance, the mouse is used to activate and manipulate puzzles and collect items. Odd, because either playing strictly with the keyboard or strictly with the mouse would have sufficed. Switching between the two is unnecessary because the menus are simple enough to be manageable with a keyboard (a very cleverly designed and accommodating PDA that could have been scrolled through), and the game is simple enough to be manageable with a few billion clicks (scant few action sequences not withstanding).   Finding said things of relevance and importance involves walking around. Instead of systematically scanning every screen with the mouse, it's now important to systematically scan every screen with Joseph himself. Eventually Joe will come across an area that is more than superficial and an appropriate icon will display, indicating some kind of action (use, take, examine) can and should be performed. Both styles are copouts, but walking is worse only because of the static camera and backdrops. It's normal to lose sight and track of Joe behind a building or in a poorly designed corner that triggers no camera switch. In such cases, blindly turning and running is the only means of escape (sometimes easier said than done).  The funny thing is after bringing up the PDA and then closing it, a magnifying glass pointer remains on screen (normally there is no such indicator). Highlighting anything of relevance with this pointer turns it gold. But this doesn't work on every item worth investigation. Some that require an object be used on them must be approached, which unfortunately means stumbling about is still the only way to go. This is but a small indication of what is sometimes a confounding and unresponsive interface (clicking with no results, precise positioning required to activate things, closing the PDA that appears too often, menus that require reassurance clicks to changeover, etcetera).  Not ones to break from tradition, the developers at Arxel Tribe are progressing the adventure genre by once again making great use of illogical and/or giveaway puzzles. There has still been no next step, no mystery that requires precise logical and actual thought to solve. In Final Cut's defense, the puzzles it employs are not as completely random as some other adventure games that require every possessed object be tried against every object in the game world in the vain hopes that when the salt is mixed with the newspaper it will cause the bum to sneeze and relinquish his whiskey that can be used to dissolve the metal around the gates that house the golden bull head that fits in the statue down the way. Well, there is some of that, but there are far more ~go here, get that, go back here~ kinds of exercises in tedium. Complimenting them are still more, different, but equally aggravating puzzles -- the ones that have no place or bearing on play, but are included because they entice the brain, or frustrate it. It should be known that these showstoppers are few and far between. Most are actually from the rather self-explanatory ilk that professional pointers and clickers unwaveringly snub their noses at.   And without consistently good puzzles of substance and worth, a game in the adventure genre must look toward exploration, interaction, story, and immersion to find its niche.   The upside is that there is plenty to explore. Final Cut is comprised of tons of beautifully prerendered backdrops. Even though a majority of the game's doors begin locked, there is still much to see and do. The downside is that exploration is only a fleeting delight, which means it's back to the puzzles: complete a puzzle to unlock a new puzzle to unlock still another that will unlock yet another. After the first few rounds of gleeful exploration, the rest of the game is very sadly sequential. On to interaction we go...      It's surprising when an adventure game, especially one inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock, features as little voice acting as Final Cut does. Interactions with other characters are few and far between. When they do occur, the dialog that follows is bland, straightforward and sometimes hard to follow and fit into the bigger, evolving and grossly mutating storyline. Conversations that all eventually play out to the same conclusion can be branching, but never require more than a simple yes or no decision be made. Because the game's nature is one of constant deception, trickery, and misdirection, anything a person says is subconsciously and rightfully taken with a grain of salt. The problem is that with so much second-guessing and puzzle and item driven tedium going on, it's hard to ever grasp the plot in its entirety. Even if one could, I'm not so sure he or she would be satisfied.    Suspense is hard to come by. The story doesn't deliver it. The conversations don't deliver it. The puzzles sure as heck don't deliver it. Above all else, you'd figure style out of the mind of Hitchcock could. Indeed, that is the justification of this game's name.  Like all adventure titles, FMV clips intersperse Final Cut and move the game along. The opening sequence is a bit misleading. The sarcastic jerk of a protagonist makes it seem as is if he is not psychic but rather a fraud; then, you play the game and poof, he gets visions triggered from objects! Here comes the Hitchcock... All of the visions Joseph receives are extremely brief clips from Alfred's various pictures (Psycho, Frenzy, Shadow of a Doubt, Saboteur, Topaz, and Torn Curtain). Certainly they add flare, drama, and style, but ultimately are only skin deep. In fact, a great many of them have absolutely no bearing on the game at all. Items, discussions, and environments lead you forward to the next puzzles. The videos are just there so that when you eventually come across the end result, you can say to yourself, ~Oh, I remember seeing that in my vision. Spooky.~   But the Hitchcockian flavor doesn't stop with the fifteen minutes worth of assembled FMV. The game is designed in a way to look very much like his films, his style. But lifeless sets, however reminiscent of those from Al's past they may be, are still just lifeless. What made them impressionable was the way in which they were lovingly and patiently delivered, played upon, and looked at. As I mentioned before, the many prerendered scenes in Final Cut are technically beautiful, but they don't make a scary game, nor does the ambient sound (jet planes, bugs, water) or dull and repetitious music. And the problem, dear friend, is that Final Cut is trying to be scary. How can I be so presumptuous to say that? The game is called Hitchcock: The Final Cut. Pay careful attention to the Hitchcock part.  I can't say what creates fear. But I can say what doesn't. Awkwardly moving about and searching for items in static environments with little sense of impending doom, overwhelming danger, or fright derived from the unknown, is not scary; it's ~adventurey.~ And this is probably why so many adventure titles are content with being comedies and/or classically old-fashioned mystery solvers.  What did you think of Final Cut?  More lighting (something perhaps akin to what Resident Evil on the GameCube is doing), more movement (backdrops with moving pieces), and more eerie and better developed conversations with those that populate this world would have worked toward the game's benefit. But how could we have ever expected this title to succeed at what it tried? Alfred Hitchcock is revered as a great amongst his peers. Greatness does not come everyday. Reverse engineering and repackaging the efforts of a genius does not create the work of a genius. It takes love, insight, experience.But even without the name Hitchcock emblazoned across the box, always pointing to the game's failure to deliver on what it promised, raising it to a higher set of standards and necessitating a harsher critique, Final Cut is still a sub par adventure outing.No suspense, puzzles of little interest, poor dialog, a tortuous storyline, and awkward control is most of what this, the videogame tribute to the great Alfred Hitchcock, has to offer. Graphics, presentation, and locale familiarity are not enough to validate purchase. Only the most avid of adventurers would apply, and because they are the ones most repulsed by the game's comparatively simplistic puzzles, even they won't find comfort here.", "date": "May 2, 2002"}
