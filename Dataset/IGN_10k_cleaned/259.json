Crystal Dynamics seems to enjoy developing plenty of games starring its favorite television-obsessed gecko, and it was only a matter of time until he popped up in portable form.  Gex has had plenty of time to play around in the third dimension, but now that he's gone back to being just an ordinary, flat bunch of pixels, he doesn't have quite as much to brag about. Gex: Enter the Gecko is plainly a common, simplistic side-scroller, with little to keep your attention locked in one place.   Features:  26 levels  Password Feature  For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  Gex: Enter the Gecko on Game Boy is just one of those games that you can pick up and control as if you've played it before.  Toss the instruction booklet aside, because if you've ever touched a strictly 2D game (and if you've got a Game Boy, you have) which relies on jumping and pummeling your foes with some sort of pain-inducing device, you know how this one works.  And that's the definition for a platformer, right?  That's a safe defense for Crave Entertainment to use, because Gex doesn't go much deeper than that.  Down to the core, Gex is an action game through and through.  Your objectives are about as simple as they come:  Jump around, dodge or destroy enemies, collect as many ~tokens~ as you can find (they differ ranging from level to level), and hope you get your slimy butt out of the many stages alive just so you can start the cycle all over again.  If you're looking for something that reminds you of what interactive entertainment was like all the way back to when Nintendo was first introduced, not counting Nintendo's own creations,  look no further!  Gex has repetitive, tedious gameplay up the wazzoo and then some!  You won't find yourself having a monumentally jolly good time as you swing your tail and leap through Enter the Gecko's levels.  Although it's enjoyable, it has absolutely nothing that you haven't seen a million times over, and probably won't make much sense in your library of portable games unless you've got a thing for lizards.  With superior Game Boy sidescrollers in stores everywhere like Wario Land, Mega Man, Castlevania, and so forth, another poor 2D intrusion like this seems almost nonsensical.  Nonetheless, it's not a complete blasphemy to all platformers everywhere, but certainly isn't a godsend either.  The part where Gex: Enter the Gecko makes neither a good nor bad impression is with its graphics.  Although it uses the Game Boy Color's abilities, it doesn't stand out in the sea of other titles which do the very same thing, but everything gets its point across.  You can tell that Gex is a lizard of some sort just as easily as you can point out the crazy sunflowers with whopping hammers at their disposal.  It isn't as flashy as some of the other games around, but it sure isn't the ugliest neighbor on the block either.  Its music, on the other hand, is in a category all of its own!  Where might that be?  Somewhere in-between ~Crap~ and ~I'd Rather Listen to 24 Straight Hours of Yanni Than This~.  With as little exaggeration as possible, Gex: Enter the Gecko's music and sound are absolutely abominable.  The short, annoying, repetitive tunes are most unfitting for any game, and would decapitate the gameplay from all perspectives if Nintendo, for some insane reason, didn't include a volume switch on its handheld wonder.  Thankfully, we can turn the sound off easily -- and since it's this terrible, there's no reason not to. Gex: Enter the Gecko is no messiah for Game Boy owners anywhere to behold.  It has nothing new to add to action platformers as a whole, and recycles tired ideas under a new name.  Every aspect strays far from perfection, and it would be a mystery to me that even the Scooby Doo gang couldn't solve if someone bought this game knowing that there are so many other better ones available.  It's not a complete pile of interactive filth, but its flaws are many, and its fun is lacking. Despite having numerous varying stages, it just doesn't manage to stack up to the rest. In this case, the gecko should have just stuck to the third dimension.", "date": "Sep 27, 1999"}
