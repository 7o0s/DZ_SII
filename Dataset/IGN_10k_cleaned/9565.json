Features  Single player game. Play as Sylvester from Looney Tunes. Three difficulty settings. Password saving. Game Boy Color and Game Boy compatible.   The Game Twouble! Casts players in the role of Sylvester, the hapless cat from WB's Looney Tunes universe. As always, Sylvester is on the prowl to capture Tweety Bird. The game starts off with a promising side-scrolling level that has Sylvester dashing from the left to the right, constantly within arm's reach of the flying food. Of course, Sylvester can't really catch Tweety here -- otherwise the game would be over... The idea of this self-scrolling stage is to watch out for obstacles, such as walls, trash cans and enemies and avoid them by pressing the jump button at the right moment. It's admittedly simplistic, but entertaining nonetheless.  Unfortunately, just when you're about to grow fond of the simple fun of jumping over stuff, the game decides it's time for a change -- to the worse. Enter the puzzle part of the game. Sylvester now finds himself stuck in a series of single-screen, isometric rooms, loosely based on Looney Tunes environments. After getting used to the new perspective (and the inevitable problems that arise from controlling a character in an isometric world with a cross-shaped D-Pad), players explore the different rooms, avoid hazards like Hector the dog or Granny and collect items. Sylvester can carry two items at the time (items can also be combined to form new ones), such as cushions (for jumping) or keys (to open doors). The idea behind the isometric mode isn't all that bad, but the spotty controls and slow pace make it tedious and boring to play.   Graphically, Twouble is also a mixed bag. The 2D parts of the game are nicely colorized, well-animated and scroll smoothly, whereas the isometric elements  look drab and feel sluggish. To make things worse, the load time between the single screens is just too long, making the game feel even slower. Sound and music are simple, with up-beat music and appropriately cartooney sound effects. Infogrames surprised me with the enjoyable Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy, so Twouble is a bit of a disappointment. Although it's cool that the French publisher tried something different with Twouble, it just didn't pan out right. The isometric stages of this game ultimately bring down what could have been a frenzied bird chase.", "date": "Jul 11, 1999"}
