{"name": "Overlord", "name_review": "Overlord AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/03/overlord-au-review", "text": "Once upon a time, there was a man named Shigeru Miyamoto and he worked for this company called Nintendo. You may have heard of both parties - I'm lead to understand they're big in gaming circles. Anyway, Miyamoto had this idea for a game involving inch-tall plant-critters who could be gathered in swarms of a number of different colours in order to work together, solve puzzles and produce more plant critters. These leafy critters were known as Pikmin, as was the game itself. It even spawned a sequel.   Well, somewhere along the way, developer Triumph Studios realised how cool the concept was and how foreign and strangely unapproachable Pikmin seemed to the average bloke and decided to take the concept for a little spin. The result? Overlord - the strange and funny tale of one evil lord's journey to overthrow seven other lords who have each given into one of the seven deadly sins.   It's great. We really like Overlord - it's a gamers' game. At its purest, like Pikmin, Overlord is all about micromanagement strategy. There's plenty of action along the way and this is one area that Overlord actually surpasses the forbearer, but largely, the game plays like Pikmin with a fresh coat of paint and a new, darker direction. The game also draws heavily from two other sources - The Lord of the Rings and Lionhead Studios' Fable. We'll delve into those aspects a little further into the review.   Morally-ambiguous-much? Hey  - Overlord has a warped sense of humour. Niiice.  Coming to grips with the dual analogue control takes all of a few moments. You control the Sauron-lookalike main character (the iconic Overlord of which the title refers) with the left analogue stick. The horde of demonic minions can be directed independently with the right analogue stick, or prompted into action by holding down the right analogue trigger.   This control setup means that you can multitask, not unlike a PC strategy game. Your central character can go about hacking things apart with his axe or cast magic with X, while up to 50 of the imp-like buggers swarm over the land, getting into fights, breaking all manner of objects and causing mayhem.   Of course, there's a lot more to the controls than that. There are four kinds of underlings to be unlocked, each with inherent abilities and elemental or physical attacks. Again, all of this is drawn from Pikmin, as is the way you can divide up the squad and direct each group separately. For instance, red imps (fire-based) are pathetically weak when thrust into close-quarters combat, but their long-distance flame attack turns them into the equivalent of archers, freeing up your brown imps (who look decidedly yellow) to take care of the hardcore muscle work.   It can be a little complicated trying to divide and select specific groups of imps during chaotic moments - this is one area that Pikmin nailed. In Pikmin, it was possible to separate all of your Pikmin into groups of like-colours with a touch of a button. Then you could manually choose what group you wanted by sweeping your circular indicator over the top of the gathering.   The red minions thrive on flames. The more flames they absorb, the more critters you can spawn and the more flaming heck you can raise.  In Overlord, the process is a little more protracted. There is no selection indicator on-screen; your demonic horde automatically trails behind you and you can round them up by holding down B. In order to divide them, you must hold down the right bumper and select a corresponding button in order to make one colour the 'right-stick priority'. That's step one. Step two, if you want to actively group them, you must set a gathering point totem with the Y button and then reselect the colour you want to attack with or take advantage of. It's just a tad convoluted.   That said, while it does take a while to get used to, the learning curve is gentle enough to ease you into the process of troop management instead of dropping you into the fray and letting you work things out for yourself.    The game itself revolves around the reconstruction of your once glorious dark tower (no relation to the superb Stephen King series, unfortunately. Actually, how good would a Dark Tower game be? Hmmm.) Like Pikmin, only part of the game revolves around exploration and decimation. The other major gameplay component lies in gathering up all sorts of handy components for your tower, such as a crane to kick off the reconstruction and an enormous forge for smelting metal and creating new armour and weapons. Each item requires a certain number of underlings to carry it too, meaning that you'll need to do a bit of backtracking in order to gather all of the pieces.    By requiring certain numbers to shift objects, turn cranks and overcome obstacles, the game's pace is well controlled and exploration is rewarded - shortcuts are opened, for example. Handy teleport pads are scattered across the landscape; inside buildings, dungeons and underground levels. These will automatically return you to your tower of refuge, where you can smith some new weaponry, consult your Tower Heart (basically a stat tracker that is situated in the basement) or head into a practice arena to take on any foe you've encountered in the game.    Puzzles aren't particularly complex and areas tend to be quite linear. However, like a good puzzle game should be, there is plenty of experimentation to be done before you strike upon a suitable solution. Likewise, there's enough variety in gameplay between boss encounters to keep the game mechanics from getting repetitive.   Codemasters has clearly played the stuffing out of Fable and taken note of how Rare pulled off its animations in Kameo, because Overlord looks like the blonde-haired, blue-eyed offspring of both titles. Like Fable, Overlord puts some emphasis on morality and shaping the world you rule over. If you want to be a tyrannical despot who kills on a whim and likes to dole out undue punishment, you can. Villagers will cower and kneel before you, begging for mercy and amusingly, and even offer up their daughters to win your dark favour.   By setting the game in an alternate Middle Earth, full of evil hobbits (referred to as Halflings) fat ogres, wispy elves and bloodthirsty Unicorns, the team has had the chance to take a fresh stance on a setting that's starting to wear thin. Who hasn't wanted to raid Hobbiton during one of their lavish parties; smashing pots, plates, tables, chairs and faces along the way?   The whole game has a warped sense of humour that is genuinely funny - which is nice for a change. The team clearly values the importance of strong writing - something that is too often neglected - and the entire script is brim-full of personality. This is coupled with some well animated characters and a great colour palette (it's refreshing to play a game that isn't rendered in washed out shades of brown) that also oozes fun.    A swarm of brown critters, eager to do your bidding. Like hauling food around.   It's not the most consistently gorgeous game, though. It aims for a Kameo-esque level of details, but falls just short. While the overworld is lush and colourful with great HDR lighting and lovely grass and trees (featuring a nice light-filtering-through-leaves effect that harkens back to Halo days), waterways and villages, the texture quality definitely varies. A few concessions were obviously made to keep the engine smooth, even when there are 50 demons running amok, so we think it's a fair trade-off. We really dig the variety of destructible objects in the game, too. Every area is filled with stuff just waiting to be sullied. Sending a wave of demons into a pumpkin patch or kitchen enclave and watching them tear the place apart never gets old.   The camera system is a little fiddly. You can click in the right thumbstick for an overhead camera view, or pull back on the stick to zoom out and away. You can also realign the camera behind you with the left bumper. But there is very little in the way of auto-alignment and having to contend with being attacked from behind while moving your troops and also having to constantly fight with the camera definitely gets annoying. An in-game map would've been handy, too - the game comes with a paper one, but that's taking the Tolkien throwback a little too far, we think.   With three different multiplayer modes and the promise of Live downloadable content, Overlord is well featured. The main quest will take you 15 hours or so to get through - and significantly longer if you pursue the side quests and dabble in weapon and armour crafting. While the morality aspect doesn't feel as deep as that of Fable, it also might add enough variation to warrant a couple replays as well.   While we didn't experience this ourselves, our beloved American IGN counterparts swear there are game-destroying bugs quite a way into the game. We weren't able to reproduce it, but it's probably worth taking into consideration if you're the kind of gamer who likes to experiment with your games and don't like having to replay sections, either. Fair warning, eh?   While its gameplay 'inspirations' are clear, Overlord is solid fun and arguably more approachable to the layman than the Pikmin games ever were. That's not to say that it's a perfect gaming experience. Overlord suffers from overly complex controls and a handful of persistent niggles that hold the potential to get under your skin. Of course, those are definitely outweighed by the fun to be had. So take a gander, why doncha?", "date": "Jul 3, 2007"}
