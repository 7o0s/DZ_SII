{"name": "Godzilla: Domination", "name_review": "Godzilla: Domination", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/09/godzilla-domination", "text": "is a cursed license in the videogame world; most gaming titles that bear the Godzilla name end up a bland mess. Massive, 200 foot tall creatures destroying cities equals a great videogame concept, but the owners of the Godzilla property are pretty darn particular in the way their big guys are portrayed. Infogrames has turned this curse around for the GameCube, at least for the most part, as Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee is a decent take on the movie monster genre. The Game Boy Advance game doesn't fair quite as well; Godzilla: Domination is a good foundation for a fighting game, but it's easily toppled because there's very little substance beyond the pretty looks. Features Six characters Seven arenas Story, Custom, and Versus modes Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge support) Only for Game Boy Advance Godzilla: Domination starts out promising with its energetic presentation. Menus are flashy and well-designed, as are the still portraits of the six different monsters in the game. In story mode, the fights are introduced by a newscaster following the player's chosen monster through the different areas, and other than the hard-to-read font the designers chose for the text, these stills look great on the GBA screen (the gratuitous knockers on Connie Matsu certainly don't hurt, either).  Even the game seems to offer a bit of hope, as the designers have patterned the GBA's first Godzilla game off of the NeoGeo arcade system's own movie monster game, King of the Monsters. Godzilla: Domination features a very similar isometric perspective to offer a more ~go anywhere~ style of fight, all while offering plenty of buildings and traffic to stomp during the battle. Character animation is also well done, even though the game offers a bare minimum roster of fighters to choose from: Godzilla, Rodan, King Ghidoran, Megalon, Mothra, and Mechagodzilla all look great in their stylized design for this fighter.  But it's all look and no substance. The fighting engine is extremely basic, with characters only given a handful of standard and special attacks based upon their unique body structure (Rodan, for example, doesn't punch...he bites). The gameplay balance just isn't there, with some characters having devastating standard attacks that can whittle an opponent's health down the more than half...Megalon's drill attack is a perfect example. But when it's a simple matter of pinning a character to the edge of the screen and continuously attacking until they walk right into the kicks and punches, the game's challenge does tend to take a nosedive. The computer AI performs some strange behavior during the fight, spending a good amount of the battle running around independent of what you're trying to do to him. Players can spend the time to smash and throw buildings to grab power-ups and score points during the battle, but since the game doesn't have any sort of save RAM in the cartridge, scoring is rather pointless. And while the GameCube fighter gets a zillion unlockables, the Game Boy Advance game gets a big goose egg in the extras department.  The game's structure does break down the battles into one-on-one, two-on-one, two-on-two, and three-on-one fights, but even this shake up in the action doesn't really offer a whole lot of variety. Players can whip through the story mode in just a few minutes, and face a really cool-looking mega-boss, but his patterned attacks are extremely easy to read and counter. The game's over before it really gets going. The single-cartridge multiplayer is definitely a welcome inclusion, but even here it seems to have been rushed; understandably, players must take control of a Godzilla in this mode, but it's the same color Godzilla for each player, which gets extremely confusing when all players are in close quarters to one another. This has to have been a limit to the Godzilla license where the designers couldn't alter the coloring of the lizard. As a compromise, each players' Godzilla has a different color circle under their character, but this is so subtle it's almost unnoticable. The game supports multi-cart multiplayer so that all six characters are selectable, but it runs into the same coloring issue for same character bouts. A game can't live off of great art alone. Godzilla: Domination looks fantastic as a GBA title, but in terms of gameplay there just isn't a whole lot to do. Six characters isn't a large roster for any fighter (and trust me, the last boss isn't a playable-type character), and the lack of extras just makes this a quick romp. Give the game an hour and you've seen everything there is.", "date": "Dec 9, 2002"}
