Actually, not all texture artists, just Alice's texture artists, mainly. I don't know what kind of slavedriver American McGee is, but he must be some kind of inhuman monster to have worked them so hard. While we're at it, how about the other level designers, or character designers... hell, the whole staff at Rogue. Alice raises the bar for level design and graphics so high that smaller development houses are just going to sigh resolutely to themselves and whisper ~well at least we've got bigger aliens in our game.~ In a year full of almost-but-not-quite trendsetters (we're not including you, Sacrifice), Alice manages to deliver a near-constant stream of wows, something I can't remember experiencing in a long, long time. While Alice isn't a perfect experience, it's just the thing to end 2000 with a proper PC bang.  As you probably know by now, this isn't your Disney take on the Wonderland world. Alice's family was killed in a fire when she was a child, and she's spent most of her existence in an asylum trying to shake off the horrors of her youth. But danger in Wonderland brings her back, on a surreal journey through a much darker world than she (or we, for that matter) remembers. Wonderland is once again under the grasp of the Queen of Hearts, and she's twisted everything upside down and backwards, slaying, mutilating, and enslaving everything in her path. You'll visit all your old friends in Alice, including the White Rabbit, the Caterpillar, the Mock Turtle and so on, but all of them have been affected by the recent events in their world. Not to mention everything has taken on the dirty look of a scary Victorian sketchbook.  The art and design of Alice are by far the strongest aspects of this game, and you'll see it within seconds of playing. The underground mines are filled with odd corners, minute details, and background animations that give Wonderland the life you always thought of when you read the original books. And as you progress through the game, it just get better, bigger, and weirder. The pale lands of the chessboard characters are giant castles straight out of Disneyland, with odd angles, mis-proportioned sizes, and towering towers. When you're shrunk in the garden, you'll be amazed and the giant mushrooms, green grass, and elaborate trees webbed over ever corner of ever section of the land. Rarely are you ever just walking down a hallway, or following a path. The designers have made sure that the levels come off as realistic and surrealistic at the same time by mimicking real life locations, and then putting them through a blender.  The level design is just as elaborate. This is still an action game first and foremost, so you won't have to deal with any particularly complicated puzzles, but the game manages to take the ~go from point A to point B~ school of design to new levels. In fact, it even takes pride in playing with the concept right in front of you by showing you an exit, and then changing the environment on the fly to confuse things. When you're stuck hopping on gears to get through a industrial section of the game, you'll be surprised at just how much work the designers went through just to get you to go ~wow, I actually have to jump from that to that?~ It's more than just making standard puzzles look prettier than your average action game -- Rogue put a lot of time into making sure that every puzzle and section was crafted just for that one gimmick, or trick. It means that the team couldn't rely on just recycling pre-made objects or gimmicks, but it really pays off. Every new part of the game is absolutely unique, from having to swim through an underwater cavern filled with falling pillars and boulders, to having to figure out how to get across a deadly chessboard when you're shaped as a horse piece. Alice's strongest point is that it constantly delivers a brand new experience, so much so that you'll be amazed at the lengths to which Rogue goes just to make sure you're impressed, yet again. That's a pretty hard thing to do in this world of jaded gamers, but Rogue pulls it off.    The down side to all this is that while your eyes are getting the supernatural treatment, your trigger finger might feel a little left out of the process. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of combat in Alice -- there's a nonstop brigade of creatures to slay on your journey. It's just that the weapon and combat system pull don't quite live up to the standard of the level design and gameplay trickery set up by the rest of the game. Take the weapons for instance, probably the weakest link in Alice's chain. While they're beautiful to look at, and filled with incredible lighting effects and animation, none of the quite do what you want them to, the way you want them to. The cards fire off fast rounds, but suck your magic (I'm callin' it magic) so quickly that you'll most likely run out after killing one enemy. The croquet mallet is powerful enough, but ridiculously slow for anything but one-on-one combat. The Jacks are incredibly powerful, use very little magic, but suffer from the same speed problem. The Jabberwocky staff, while incredibly powerful, takes a ridiculously long time to charge. It's perfect for group encounters, but only as long as you pretty much know when you're about to face a bunch of enemies. Again, it's not that they're horrible, by any means... but like many shooters that have tried to pull away from the Quake school of gun etiquette, you'll find yourself wishing for weapons that were more balanced.  In fact, the gameplay scheme just doesn't quite fit with the third person style in general. Imagine if Tomb Raider focused a lot more on fighting, and less on exploration, and you'll get a sense of how Alice's combat comes across. The auto aim is fantastic, the controls work fine when attacking... but the speed and process of slaying a group of enemies is so slow paced and methodical that you'll be wanting to run past enemies instead of fighting, just to get to the next area. Of course, when you've got a constant stream of new environments like Alice has, it more than makes up for the lack of solid woman-on-robot/jabberwocky/devil/flower battling.  The graphics, as I think I've repeated about 50 times, are monumental, but let me just add that the character designs shine just as much. The detail on the characters is truly impressive, as are the rounded edges and high poly counts. The animation also fits this, filling them with a ton of character, something essential to really pulling you into Wonderland. The music puts a tasty frosting over the whole thing with its toy pianos, childlike melodies, and deceivingly simply structure. It doesn't fit at all with the violent gameplay, and yet fits so completely that you'll find yourself noticing its presence in the background much more than your average game. The voice acting rounds everything out beautifully, from Alice's prim British accent and the Cheshire Cat's sly speaking style, to the Jabberwocky's grumbled monster voice. As with the graphics, Rogue spared no expense in making sure that the music, voice acting and sound effects lived up to the rest of the product.  One last thing -- there's no multiplayer in Alice. I'm of the belief that if you aren't going to implement a full-featured multiplayer game, then you shouldn't tack one on-- which Alice didn't -- but some of you may have gripes with this. Alice's single player game is so immersive, though, that I doubt any of you out there are going to be nodding your heads, saying ~this game could have been perfect, if only...~   Despite some repetition in the combat, as well as some problems with control at points (particularly in trying to get Alice to swim and attack coherently), Alice impresses, and keeps impressing. It's really rare that you play a game that's just so consistently brilliant, and never falls to the ~first level punch~ only to peter out as you get more than halfway through the game. Alice will suck you in, and keep you interested through its entire elaborate journey. When's the expansion pack coming out?  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
