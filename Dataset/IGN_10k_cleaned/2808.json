The game mechanics put some serious strain on your hands, but no matter how much it hurt, the game was impossible to put down.  The second Taxi hit for the Dreamcast and while some balked, it was still a solid game.  Now comes Crazy Taxi 3, exclusive to Xbox.  And while the thought of Crazy Taxi making use of the Xbox' incredible hardware is enough to make one dampen their shirt with saliva, the results are rather disappointing.  I was never a huge fan of Crazy Taxi 2, but at least it had some innovation.  It offered multiple customer deliveries and the Crazy Hop, which changed the dynamics of the game considerably.  And though the new cities weren't that great, the mini-games were fantastic and it was, at least, a different experience than the initial Taxi.  But Crazy Taxi 3's only real innovation is redesigning the West Coast city from the first CT so that the Crazy Hop and multiple customer pickup could be used.  Granted, they did a great job in that department, but what's gained here feels more like something you get from a port of a year-old game than a new version all to itself.  If anything, this should be called Crazy Taxi 2.5.  And that's a shame.  Features  Three cities (one new, two redesigned from previous versions) Four new drivers Unlock all eight classic drivers for use in any city Offspring and Bad Religion songs... shocking! Twenty-five Crazy X mini-games to test your Crazy skills Only for Xbox  Gameplay If you've never played Crazy Taxi before, there's something very wrong with you. But here's the lowdown.  You're a cab driving looking to bust out the big bucks by taking wacky customers to their destinations.  There's a ton of button-tapping to be had, trying to speed, drift, and jump your way to the lap of luxury.  With about 40 different locations (many of them real-life stores like KFC and Tower Records), there's a lot of short-cut memorization needed to succeed.  Toss in some mini-games and you have yourself a game that was a sensation when first released.  The series has kept to its roots.  In fact, it's really the same game as CT 2, but with some cosmetic changes, a new city, and a few new mini-games.  That doesn't sound too different than what most franchise games do.  A few new touches and then throw it out for massive sales numbers.  The only problem comes when the old, fun gameplay, just isn't as much fun anymore.  And that's what's happened here.  The gameplay hasn't aged well, or rather, hasn't been translated well into the latest version.  To get around in Crazy Taxi 3, you'll need some crazy skills.  Anyone who mastered CT 2 will have a leg up on the rest, because there are no new skills to master.  The Crazy Dash (drive and acclerate at the same time) remains the most important skill of all.  You've got to keep dashing constantly.  There's also the Crazy Hop, which lets you use hydraulics to propel your cab in the air.  And let's not forget the Crazy Drift, Crazy Stop, and Crazy Drift Stop.  You don't lose any of the functions from the previous Taxis, but you don't gain any either.  Down in front!  The key to besting Taxi is twofold.  First, you've got to be a master with all of the various crazy skills.  This will get you through the twenty-five mini-games and will also put you on the road to success in the regular game.  The other thing you have to do to succeed is learn the city.  This has always been true of each Crazy Taxi, but is perhaps more so in the latest.  The new city, Glitter Oasis, is spread out a bit thin.  Inside the city itself (which is somewhat modeled after Vegas), it's not much of a problem finding your way around.  In fact, the city is a little too simple in terms of navigation.  But you will absolutely need shortcuts outside the city limits.  When driving around the desert highway or through the Grand Canyon, it's easy to get lost or make the wrong turn.  There are a lot of little shortcuts throughout these areas, which an expert will take time to learn.  If you're not that hardcore of a cabbie, there's still going to be fun for you in Glitter Oasis.  But it's unlikely you'll be able to rack up huge cash, simply because those shortcuts are vital to long-term success.  Sure you can get customers to their destination, but you won't be able to do it fast enough to add to your allotted time.  West Coast from the first Taxi and Small Apple from the second have been redesigned.  There's not too much special about the Small Apple redesign, but the West Coast is fantastic.  This remains the best city in the series and it's now even better.  You can now pick up multiple customers and you have the Crazy Hop available (things not possible when the first Taxi was released).    That's gotta be bad for your tires.  Take that familiar drive down the hills of San Francisco, but this time Crazy Hop onto the rooftops.  There's more there than just a few roofs.  You'll find lots of little surprises all over the place in West Coast.  Not only will you have access to new places (like a bigger ocean), but the city itself has been slightly expanded.  The old standards are still there as well, like the church and the Fila Store.  The customers have changed to reflect the multiple groups now available in the series.  Multiple customers was a great addition to CT 2 and it's good to see Hitmaker's kept it in for number 3.  Basically, you can pick up small groups of like-minded folks, like body builders or mascots, and drop them off at various locations.  As cool as this is, Crazy Taxi still hasn't gone to the next level.  Why not make it so you can pick up multiple individual customers as you go along.  For example, you are already driving a lady to the casino when you spot another customer and decide to pick them up as well.  You can't do that yet, but you have to wonder why not.  Certainly with the power of the Xbox and two solid Taxi games behind them, Hitmaker could have made this leap for CT 3.  As fun and dandy as driving around cities may be, the mini-games are where it's at.  This time around gamers get to enjoy Crazy X, featuring twenty-five mini-games.  These will teach you the skills necessary to compete on the various levels.  If you don't have your skills perfected, these mini-games will be an absolute bear.  But as much as they frustrate, it's impossible to stop trying.  And that's what has made the series so popular.  That inability to put the controller down.  Even though CT 3 has more mini-games than the previous two versions, they do come off as a little cheap.  Some of the challenges are taken almost straight from the previous installments of Taxi.  And rather than create new and interesting backdrops, Sega has reused settings from past mini-games.  Some could call this nostalgia, but really it just seems cheap.    Crazy Taxi is still fun, especially the redesigned West Coast, but the gameplay is basically untouched from before.  That's not so terrible since the game has always had solid control, but to have nothing new to offer in a new version?  Disappointing.    Graphics Not only was the gameplay left untouched, but so were the graphics.  With the exception of some fabulous Wreckless-like neon lighting in Glitter Oasis, Crazy Taxi 3 looks like a Dreamcast game from head to taillight.  The game runs smooth, for the most part, but has spots of slowdown, especially in the glitzy Glitter Oasis.  The graphical additions to Xbox are so minimal and subtle that they're difficult to find.  Most notable are the brilliant neon lights of Vegas.  But these pretty lights only affect a short portion of the city and put against the rather unspectacular cars, sidewalks, buildings, and people, it seems incredibly out of place.  It is such a contrast that it makes the rest of the game look worse than it really is.  Where are my beautifully reflective cars?  Or some varied animations from pedestrians?  Why are there so many jaggies?  You can't make one small part of a scene look Xbox-worthy but leave the rest as cookie-cutter Dreamcast visuals.  If you're gonna go all out, do it.    Lighting, also from the headlights, is the only strong visual improvement of Taxis past.  But without the lighting, Glitter Oasis is a disappointment.  Vegas is a great place to draw inspiration from, but the city here is hardly inspired.  The actual city is quite small and many of your fairs will take you to the rather sterile locales of the Grand Canyon and the desert.  Why isn't there a building with a roller coaster wrapped around it?  Why aren't there a ton more interesting people walking around?  What about some humorous signs?  Some gaudy cars for traffic?  A Liberace or Elvis reference?  How could you make Vegas uninteresting?  The effort clearly wasn't there for this version as the new city, Glitter Oasis, misses the boat on a ton of exciting ~Las Vegas~ prospects.  The city could have really been a feast for the eyes, but it isn't.  It's flat (minus those big canyons) and it lacks verve.  And if you're gonna recreate Vegas, it can't lack verve.  Johnny Cash is not actually in the game.  Sound Crazy Taxi 3 is the only thing keeping Bad Religion and The Offspring in business.  There's a weird thing about video games, where a crap band like The Offspring can actually be enjoyable on a console.  On the radio or in concert?  Total trash.  But for whatever reason, those hours spent listening to them while playing CT 3 don't seem so bad.  It would be nice if the other two bands, Bad Religion and Citizen Bird were more prominent, since they actually have talent.  While so much of Taxi hasn't changed when it should have, it's nice to know that The Offspring will always be associated with the title.  It wouldn't be right to go crashing into buildings without their God-awful music soothing my pained fingers.  The fact that there are only nine songs total (three from each band), is a bit of a let-down. Especially since most of them are from previous Taxis.  But maybe three Offspring songs are all you need each year to get you by.  As for sound effects, it's nothing you haven't heard in previous versions.  Screeches, crashes, burnt rubber, and obnoxious cabbies are the same as ever.  The city still fails to vibrate with sound and the citizens don't offer up enough varied chatter to make them worth listening to.   It's strange how a game can have new mini-games and even a big new level and still feel old.  Fans of the Taxi series will probably pick this up no matter what I say.  For those who have never experienced Taxi before, the game will likely come off as a fresh new experience.  But for us old hats, this one-trick pony is getting a little stale.  The mini-games are still the best part of the series, but here they will end up being pretty easy once you have command of your Taxi skills.  Plus, some of them are straight from previous versions of the title, which is plain cheap.  There is still enjoyment to be found here, but this game certainly won't keep you hooked for months (or even weeks) like the original.  Probably a great pick-up for about $30, but it may be overpriced at the MSRP $50.It's clear that the creative vibrancy that first imagined the Taxi series has waned considerably.  Either Hitmaker needs to step back and redesign the franchise into something new and exciting or they just need to give up the ghost and let a once-great game go to greener pastures.", "date": "Jul 22, 2002"}
