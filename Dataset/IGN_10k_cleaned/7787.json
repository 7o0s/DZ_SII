Truly the franchise stood head-and-shoulders above the competition to dominate the hockey genre for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unfortunately, the 64-bit update to the favored series bears little more in common with its predecessors than the same title. It was Konami's first attempt at the hockey genre for the N64 and it shows in a big way.  The Facts  All 27 NHL teams including the expansion Nashville Predators. Western and Eastern conference All-Star teams. Updated 98-99 team rosters. Create-a-player mode. Three game play modes: exhibition, season, and playoffs. Season and Playoff state tracking in more than 35 categories.  Memory Pak support. Rumble Pak compatible.  Four player simultaneous multiplayer mode.   Gameplay Blades of Steel was the ~Blitz~ of hockey before NFL Blitz and had Konami played on that fact, well, we might have seen an entirely different, most likely better effort from the developer. What hockey fans have been issued instead is a game that tries desperately to mimic NHL 99; A game that tries to deliver a simulation-take on the sport of hockey and, ultimately, Blades of Steel just doesn't cut the mustard.  Upon booting the game, one gets the feeling that it just might be OK. After all, Konami did take the time to introduce its product with an original, somewhat refreshing opening cinema and a style that,  using a series of colored spotlights and off-kilter music, resembles something out of the feature film The Running Man. Not exactly vintage hockey material, but alright, we'll give it a shot. The fact that the game boasts an official endorsement from Jaromir Jagr also helps us to keep our hopes high. And then the game kicks in and everything goes downhill.  With EA's NHL 99 and Acclaim's NHL Breakaway 99 having been released already, Konami was  stuck behind the proverbial eight ball with the hopes of being equal if not better than the two previously mentioned. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the standards already set. The game moves at an extremely slow, almost unforgivable pace; It's almost like the players on the screen are skating under water. Controlling the athletes on the ice feels downright sluggish and highly unintuitive. Likewise, the passing system is simplistic, but slow and clumsy. Additionally, players tend to get caught up in the corners of the ice for no reason whatsoever, which never fails to annoy. Another glaring problem that stands out is that skaters change automatically (and at the most inopportune times) during play, making it difficult to line up your opponent for a bone-jarring body check. This feature (if you want to call it that) is highly detrimental to gameplay.  Quite frankly, there really isn't much in the way of options for Blades of Steel '99 that hasn't been done equally as good or far better in competing hockey games. The multiplayer mode feels thrown in and really, because the game moves at such a tiresome slow pace, it just isn't all that fun. Even Midway's Wayne Gretzky franchise is much more responsive, faster, and, because of that, fun.   Graphics Blades of Steel '99 actually looks quite a bit like the Gretzky series. The game features big, polygonal hockey players and bright, pastel colors. The title also boasts a few added extras like real-time reflections and shadows. These relatively simple effects go a long way to enhancing the realism of the environment, as advertisements are mirrored on the ice, as are the player's frames. Unfortunately, the game's slow, unacceptable framerate comes back into play once again and does its very best to ruin any graphic polish Blades of Steel '99 may or may not have had. Add to the fact that the gameplay perspective is often seriously out of whack, serving up some incredibly weird angles, and the graphics just don't work. The International Superstar Soccer franchise aside, Konami hasn't had very much like with top visuals for Nintendo 64 and unfortunately Blades of Steel is no exception.  Sound Sound isn't top notch but it is better that Acclaim's Breakaway offerings. The game uses Randy Hahn (the voice of the San Jose Sharks) for announcing duties, which is a nice touch, but the commentary quickly grows repetitive, especially after six or seven shifts of the same phrases. Blades of Steel features pretty standard music that probably isn't going to offend anybody, but it certainly won't stand out in the ears and minds of its listeners either. As much as I tried to enjoy this game, I couldn't overlook its horrible gameplay mechanics and terrible player control. The game is just too slow and doesn't do the NHL, Jaromir Jagr, or the coolest sport on Earth justice. This will never be mistaken for a top tier hockey video game and in no way does it even compare to the leader in the genre of hockey video games, EA's NHL 99. However, if you're looking for a decent way to waste a few dollars and you're an absolute hockey junkie, then you may want to give Blades of Steel '99 a try. It's not a terribly bad game, it simply doesn't equal up to the competition's far superior offerings.", "date": "Apr 13, 1999"}
