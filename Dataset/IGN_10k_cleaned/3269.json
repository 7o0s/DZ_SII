On the Game Boy Advance, wrestling fans pretty much have only two choices: BAM's localization of the niche-popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, and whatever game THQ releases using the World Wrestling Entertainment license. In our review of Fire Pro Wrestling II for the GBA, we mentioned that it would be a good idea for THQ and Natsume to look at that design for its next WWE game, and while it was most likely happening well before we made that statement, it seems that's exactly what the developers have done for WWE Road to Wrestlemania X8 for the handheld. The latest game is very playable with almost no button-mashing in its gameplay...but the problem lies in the behavior of computer opponents. Once you learn the ~money moves,~ you'll never lose a fight. Features 15 different wrestlers from the WWE. Seven WWE venues Collectible WWE merchandise Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Road to Wrestlemania X8 (which will be known as X8 throughout the rest of the review) is definitely a positive progression of the classic old-school side-scrolling wrestling games. The Game Boy Advance can't push the same 3D environments that the console WWE developers have been creating on the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, so Natsume, the developers of the past THQ WWF games on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance worked in a pretty snazzy 2D engine for X8. Each wrestler in the game is constructed of multiple, digitized body parts that move both separately and together...sort of as if the characters were paper dolls with different head, chest, arm and leg parts. This gives the developers the ability to create fluid animations using a minimal amount of sprites; for example, the wrestlers appear to breathe heavily because the chest sprite rises and falls at a different rate than the arms and head. This engine offers mixed results in their imagery, such as somewhat robotic motions in some of the key animations, and heads that seem to have a defining neck line...but the benefits are definitely stronger than the drawbacks. I don't think the game would have as many characters or animations without this unique engine.  And what a roster of wrestlers it is. X8 features the likes of The Rock, Triple H, Hollywood Hogan, Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho,Kane, Kevin Nash, Rob Van Dam, Edge,Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Christian, and Test, each with their own entrance music as they saunter to the ring at the beginning of the match. These entrances are a far cry from what the console WWE fans get in Shut Your Mouth and Raw, and they are somewhat disappointing especially after last year's WWF title that actually made the attempt with the camera-cutting entrances. But stuff like that would fill up a cartridge, and Natsume went with other features to give X8 its charm; the game features seven different types of WWE venues, including Raw, Smackdown, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, Summerslam, King of the Ring, and Wrestlemania, as well as different styles of play that alter what can be done during the match; you've got Single, Tag Team, Cage Match (climb to the top of the cage instead of pinning the other person), Triple Threat, Fatal 4 Way, Elimination, Handicap, and Lumberjack. Weapons can also be toggled on and off as well. The Pay-Per-View mode is actually really cool -- not only do you have to pick a good venue that everyone wants to watch, you have to perform well in each of the matches to get a high rating. If you don't gain enough points at the end of the event, Vince McMahon will yell at you in a digitized still screen; earn enough points, and you unlock another venue to the list of Pay-Per-View events. And, thanks to the game's Japanese roots, X8 even has a little Pokemon in it: for every specific victory, you'll earn WWF items in the WWF Shopzone. View items like t-shirts, plush dolls, money clips, and DVDs. This Shopzone is just a strange area for bragging rights, but it's a neat addition.     The controls are actually quite intuitive, even though there are so many different moves in the game. The A button is the grapple, the B button's the attack, and the R button works as a multifunction control, from running to switching out the type of grapple you have on the opponent. The game gives the grapple to the wrestler who touched the opponents' shoulders first, not who was quicker on the action button. Same thing with the kicks and punches. Some wrestlers are slower than others in this move right from the get-go, but everyone loses speed as they take a beating. After a grapple, players can use the R button to change up the grab (moving from the rear to the front or vice versa) or carry the opponent to a different, safer part of the ring. Players can throw the opponent into a run with the R button as well which can then be turned into an attack or counter on the return from the ropes, or the grapple can be turned into one of several different moves by using the A or B button with the D-pad in a specific direction. Each of the 15 wrestlers have their own unique moves during grapples...they're mostly for show since all of the moves whittle down the opponents' unseen stamina gauge. Every single wrestler also has a signature move that can be pulled off when the power bar is filled and blinking; they're all pulled off the same way, by mashing the A and B buttons at the same time...but it's up to you to discover where that command must be utilized. Some signature moves can only be pulled off in a front grabble, others in a rear grapple. Some must be activated near the turnbuckle, while others have to be performed while the opponent is face down on the mat.  This game is deep in features, and the controls are very inviting with its emphasis on timing rather than button mashing. The problem is that the game has a lot of computer AI patterns that are easily exploitable, even on the most difficult settings. During the Royal Rumble, for example, all that's needed to knock an opponent out of a ring is to grapple and throw him into the ropes, chasing after him after the release. When the opponent bounces back off the ropes, a simple running attack will send him flying over the ropes for an easy victory. The computer opponents are also easy to read when it's safe to grapple them...if it's not safe, simply running away from them will leave them open for an easy attack. It only takes about an hour of play to find all the AI patterns necessary to win any match...after that, the only challenge left in single player is to unlock all of the Pay-Per-View modes and find all the hidden extras in the WWE shop. The game's strength is definitely in its four player link play, because human players are much less predictable...but you'll need a copy of the game for each of the systems that want to join in the brawl. There are some really, really good ideas in this wrestling game, from its use of the Pay Per View for its challenges, to the Shopzone item collection, to its record keeping that shows each of the WWE belts and which wrestler it was won from. The side-scrolling 2D engine does a great job letting the developers create some believable animations for each of the wrestler's signature moves, while also creating believable digitizations of those characters on the GBA's screen. The problem is in its challenges, and its computer AI. Oh, sure, you'll definitely find yourself kissing the mat several times before you fully learn the game's controls, but the holes in the opponents' behavior are wide open, left for you to exploit. Once you've found them, there's no stopping you from taking the belts. I do, however, recommend this game as a multiplayer design, because it's a lot more difficult to read what a human opponent will do in the action.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
