{"name": "Sheep", "name_review": "Sheep", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/11/sheep-4", "text": "The struggle between man and nature is a classic one.  Yet in Empire Interactive's latest offering, Sheep, the conflict gets infinitely more personal.  Although this title casts barnyard animals as protagonists, the burden of saving the day falls heavily upon the shoulders of the player.  It's a time-honored test of intellect that'll have even veteran puzzle game fans tearing their hair out in chunks.  Everyone else can just stare in awe as would-be geniuses get their MENSA membership cards revoked by overgrown lamb chops whose entire vocabulary consists of the word ~Baaaa.~  As far as normality is concerned, there's no looking back once the character selection process gets underway.  Four goofy herders, including street punk Adam Halfpint, alt-rocker Bo Peep, faithful pooch Shep, and Lassie wannabe Motley round out the roster of selectable alter-egos.  Each boasts his or her own particular style of shepherding, with some individuals being more aggressive for instance, while others lack self confidence and rely on kindness and empathy to get the job done.  In practice, this choice won't be all that relevant to the gameplay, so go with whoever strikes your fancy.  Afterwards, the games begin.  Players face down levels in groups of four.  A quartet of critter breeds (Modern Pastoral, Modern Factoral, Long Wool, Neo Genetic) must be guided safely through all twenty eight stages to Blue Hawaii, a wool gatherer's paradise.  But sheep sure are some stupid mammals.  They flock together mindlessly, bumble about confused when separated from kin, and do everything else in their power to get killed.  Meanwhile, all you're able to do is indirectly affect the creatures' movement by running at them and/or shouting.  Stepping or running towards a group causes it to slowly proceed or book it to a roughly equal distance in the opposite direction.  That's a surefire recipe for trouble if ever a computer geek's heard one.  So here you are, plopped down in a hostile environment, left with a crew of four-legged 'tards in tow.  Whatever happens when they're marched from the starting point to the exit, it isn't going to be a pretty sight.  Drill sergeants can't just assume their charges will successfully navigate the myriad hazards populating interstellar worlds, farm processing plants, medieval dungeons and stranger locales.  Personal attention's required on all fronts, as alone or in flocks, sheep will run afoul of spinning axe blades, tractors, crushing hammers, homicidal veggies, dinosaurs, and worse without a human's guidance.  Good luck in those endeavors to bring a minimum number of sheep safely to the exit within the allotted time - you're going to need it.  Even with power-ups (sheep love radios, candies, aphrodisiacs, etc.) and the occasional reinforcements, this is a beastly game.  While stage layouts never change, one's tactics must, else their efforts will ultimately meet with disaster.  Sometimes it's even necessary that the player leave his/her flock behind, scouting ahead to open gates, find switches, or look for important gadgets like springs that send sheep soaring over waterways. And the clock's ticking the whole damn time.  Does it get frustrating?  You bet your sweet patootie, and if restart attempts are anything to go by, the difficulty level's a ballbuster.  Training sessions and earlier levels are a breeze and, as a result, inadequately prepare you for the lengthier, more robust challenges that lurk down the road.  An overhead angle gives you a nice view of the immediate surroundings, but objects and characters were proportionately shrunk so they'd fit on the screen.  The decor's cuter than a candy coated Cabbage Patch Kid in a baby blanket, though aesthetically the game feels too much like an Army Men title for the experienced gamer's liking.  Thankfully, the worst of the complaints center on movies which depict fruity scenes from a sheep's everyday life, such as disco dancin' and zoning out in front of the boob tube.  On the audio front, this game's like a barn in a box.  Silly remixes soothe the ear canal, even if certain members of the wild kingdom won't shut up for a minute.  ~Baaaah... baaaah... baaaah...~  He who isn't tempted to throw the computer out the window would make a fine candidate for Zen Buddhist or Franciscan monk.  The whole affair is mostly shouts, offbeat gadget noises, and a big, fat dollop of British humor.  Although too outlandish for the average mucker, and sporting a few rough edges, Sheep's nevertheless a pleasing diversion.  It's no Lemmings, mind you, but the product's a certified keeper.  Provided the title's not destined for a mentally deficient recipient who lacks a sense of humor, a positive reception is virtually guaranteed.  Call it good timing on Empire's part, but most recent ultra-challenging puzzlers just haven't been this enjoyably wild and wooly.  -- Steve Kim     Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Sheep is a worthy addition to those of you who value strangely addictive puzzle/strategy games. It offers enough humor (slightly twisted humor), to garner a chuckle from time to time. Sheep falls into an awkward place among the portable gaming devices of today. As a cell phone offering, Sheep would have been extraordinary, but as a full-fledged GBA title it feels a little too shallow. In other words, Sheep is perfect to play while waiting around at the DMV, but your gaming time at home would be better dedicated to other titles.", "date": "Nov 11, 2000"}
