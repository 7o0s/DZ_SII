Black Bass Lure Fishing debuted in 2000, and even still we can remember the amazingly horrid gameplay teamed with graphics Majesco claimed to be ~3D~ on the Game Boy Color.  Luckily, fishing fans got what they deserved when the GBA debuted, as American Bass Challenge offered gamers a solid fishing simulator.  Black Bass Fishing was back again, though no American release was given.  It was obvious who the victor was then, and even though we have no new competitor to put against Super Black Bass Fishing on DS, there really is no need, as Super Black Bass Fishing manages to commit gaming suicide all on its own.   In fact, aside from some basic touch control -- and we do mean basic -- nothing huge has changed from the previous Black Bass production over the last decade.  The control is still terrible, the fishing is still painfully boring, and the lack of depth will have players wishing they would have saved their retail store credit.  Super Black Bass Fishing allows players to participate in practice, multiplayer, or tournament modes.  No matter which mode is selected, the gameplay is still pretty much the same.  Players choose a location via the touch screen, move the boat, and get cracking.  It's simply baffling how terrible the interface is, however, as players will use the touch screen to tap arrows which move the boat.  How is this any different from just steering the boat with the D-pad?  Well, it isn't.  Hey, at least it's ~innovative,~ right?     As the boat moves from place to place, a visual of the area is shown on the top screen.  Once an area is chosen, the casting interface shows up on the bottom screen.  The DS version is practically identical to previous versions, though instead of moving a D-pad to select the direction of casting you can opt to use the touch screen.  From here, you cast.  Again, the gameplay is exactly like it was on the GBC, and rather than actually drawing a cast motion with the stylus (a la True Swing Golf) you tap the power meter.  Wow.  Tap the meter to start it, tap it again to send the lure flying.   So the lure's in the water.  This is where the action begins, right?  Not quite.  Players can either tap the bottom screen or opt to use the D-pad to control their lure.  The object is to entice fish into hitting our bait, though the entire atmosphere is very bland.  Fish will sit still doing a basic idle animation, and then suddenly start sliding around the screen.  Sometimes they'll move towards the lure, other times they seem to not even see it.     The problem here is that the fish don't seem lifelike in the slightest, so rather than being suspenseful before the catch, it's just boring.  Another issue with the gameplay is the ~mood~ system that is used to simulate fish behavior.  As players reel in, the fish's mood will periodically change to one of 10 different feelings.  The idea is to give the sense of a psychological battle between man and fish, but in reality it is a seriously broken system.  The moods change at what seems like a random rate, and as long as players keep casting over and over toward the fish it will eventually grab the bait.  With enough persistence, the fish will make a hit.   Alright.  So we went through all the preparation, moved the boat to the desired location, got the fish's attention and now it's on to the big battle.  Surely this is where the game will shine.  Wrong again.  Once a battle begins, players simply scribble on the meter on the touch screen to reel it in.  Where's the fun in that?  We've seen LCD games that can entertain for hours with simple ~tension~ bars and ~string power~ meters.  There's no fight in the catch, and that's the whole reason for fishing in both the real world and the virtual one.  No touch interface for pulling the reel, no difference between big and small fish (aside from the amount of scribbling needed), and ultimately no fun.  DS could be the perfect system for a solid fishing game, though Super Black Bass Fishing manages to phase out the fun at every single turn.   In fact, not only is the game not entertaining, it's actually insulting to the hardware.  The music is amazingly basic, the sound affects are weak, and the audio experience gives no added feel to the environment.  Worse yet, when playing a multiplayer mode the music is only played through the first player's DS.  How is that even an issue?     Graphically the game suffers as well.  The story mode offers cutscenes, though they are by far the worst moments in any DS game thus far.  It honestly looks like the animation and character art was taken straight off an old Web game.  The fish swim in place or slide around the screen using only a few frames of animation, and the lures follow suit, sliding from left to right rather than actually giving the illusion of a piece of bait in the water.  We could go on for pages about the shortcomings in Super Black Bass, but it simply isn't worth it.  It may only be $20, but Super Black Bass Fishing isnt worth a dime.  The gameplay is amazingly terrible, the audio and visual production is a joke, and the actual act of fishing wont hold up against Radicas Bass Fishin games, much less any actual DS or GBA cart.  Multiplayer is included with only one copy of the game, though its just as boring as single player, offering absolutely no actual player vs. player elements.  The entire game is a joke, and obviously a cheap marketing ploy to cash in on the budget gaming market.  Dont be fooled, Super Black Bass Fishing stinks to high hell.  Any gamer tempted to purchase this title should hand their cash to the nearest five year old.  At least theyll know to save their cash for New Super Mario Bros.", "date": "Apr 7, 2006"}
