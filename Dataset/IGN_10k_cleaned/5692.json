It's difficult to turn on a TV nowadays without ending up as a fly on a wall during a poker tournament. Bravo's got the Celebrity Poker Showdown, the Travel Channel airs the World Poker Tour, ESPN handles the World Series of Poker, and so on. World Championship Poker: Deluxe Series aims to capitalize on the poker craze, and even with a few sloppy loose ends in the production, this DS collection of card games pulls it off pretty well.  At the very least, World Championship Poker has a surprising and impressive amount of depth to its development for a game that has seemingly come out of nowhere. The Nintendo DS version is based on the PlayStation 2 edition released last year only in namesake; the dual screen version, developed by Sensor Sweep, is a completely original design for portable gamers with several elements that take advantage of the handheld functions of the Nintendo DS. Within the package are single and multiplayer versions of poker variations such as Texas Hold 'em, Five Card Draw, Seven Card Stud, and lesser known variations like Baseball and Omaha. There are twelve poker games in all, but the cartridge also hides some hidden little games like Blackjack and Video Poker. And keen explorers will find a couple of neat gambling mini-game gems like an air hockey table and a dart board that are surprisingly decent for being hidden treats.  And the way these games are presented is actually pretty cool, too. In career mode, players move in a fully 3D first-person engine from table to table in the casino, with the lower screen tracking the player's location in an overhead view. As long as a table's on the map, players can simply tap the screen to go directly to the game played at that particular location. There are tables to simply win money, and others to join specific tournaments. But there is also a world outside the starter casino, and players are encouraged to move up in the world to the more classy casinos by winning the specific tournaments at the lesser locations. Fancy casinos offer more pricey tournaments but with a higher payout if your skills are up there.   In career mode, players go head-to-head against 3D modeled computer opponents, but they lack visual tells beyond their normal table actions. The on-screen personas have animation, but they're simply generic movements that mean nothing to the current game at hand. The old guy, for example, will reach for his inhaler whether he's got a fantastic or crappy hand. The AI behavior is all over the place; some players will fold when the pot gets too rich, but it's stunning to see how many opponents will go ~all in~ when you do it on the very first hand in a tournament. Overall World Poker Championship offers up a good amount of challenge in single player, even if there are some quirks in the artificial intelligence.  Winnings in career mode can be converted into purchased items, accessories, or player attributes. Luck, game face, intimidation or other attributes can be bought that apparently have some benefit in the poker games, but the documentation never makes mention of how this actually comes into play against computer opponents. You'll just have to trust that it's money well spent. Accessories will ~bling~ out your player, but there's a bug in the game that allows you to constantly buy the same item over and over again with no restriction. So keep that in mind if you accidentally buy an Afro more than once...you're only going to have one in possession. Other items are apparently there just for kicks: hamburgers, martini glasses, motorcycles, and others are simply collectibles that have no basis on the rest of the game, so their inclusion is somewhat odd.  The card games are full-featured and offer all the necessary functions that are necessary to play, but it's just a little sloppy the way everything's laid out in front of the player. For example, important information, such as your current winnings, gets lost among the clutter of other data instead of sticking out as one of the most obvious details on the screen. In Texas Hold 'em, at the end of a hand, you literally have to remember which cards were among the hole, flop, turn, and river, since the computer shows each of the players' best hand instead of their two hole cards and the common table cards for reference.   Though the touch screen gives much more direct control over the cards and chips, it's a bit on the sluggish side with close to full second delays between tapping the on-screen button and the result of that tapping. It's more awkward than it is awful, though, but it certainly could have been cleaned up if the developers added visual feedback to the button images when they're tapped. As it is, the only way you know that a button's been touched is the actual result of that button push, instead of having the button illuminate or appear like it's been pushed inward.  And though the game is generous with its save RAM function by offering two slots for individual career modes, it won't save a tournament when it's progress. If a tournament has multiple games, it will record the win, but it would have been much more helpful had the game offered a ~save anywhere~ function during these lengthy competitions instead of between rounds that could last several minutes apiece. World Championship Poker does make up for the clumsy interface by offering single cartridge multiplayer poker for up to six players using the wireless networking function. Most of the card games can be played in this mode, which adds a whole lot to the value of the package. It works well, though it's not entirely flawless -- networked players can't name their own on-screen persona for some reason, so it's tough to remember which player's controlling each avatar. The owner of the cartridge also can't pull up his created player from the single player career mode, which is a shame considering all the customization you can do, and you have no outlet in which to show other players your creation. I honesty wasn't expecting much out of World Championship Poker for the Nintendo DS, but the game has surprised me with a much deeper presentation than I would have ever anticipated. I will say that it could have used a little more time in development to iron out a few issues, but even with numerous amounts of nitpicky flaws in its interface, this compilation offers a lot of decent card gameplay on the handheld.", "date": "Apr 20, 2005"}
