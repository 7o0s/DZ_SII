And as I played California Games and T&C Surf Designs in the opaque zombie-like glaze that was my youth, part of me couldn't help but to look forward. Eagerly anticipating whatever would be spawned next in a series of skateboarding, bike riding, or surfing extravaganzas. Many years later with my Dreamcast controller in hand and several hours of Mattel Interactive's Championship Surfer in the record books, the only thing I can say with certainty is that I truly miss the good old days.  Set around the fictional floating landmass of ~Waves Island~ (supposedly located somewhere near Fiji), your goal in Championship Surfer is the same as its been in any other extreme game released over the last couple of years; Perform tricks and grinds all over the game's many levels in order to score a lot of points and be deemed ~gnarly~ by your peers. And while this kind of basic premise works well in titles like Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX and Tony Hawk Pro Skater, it falls apart miserably in this one.  One of the biggest culprits for this downward spiral of a popularized gameplay idea is the graphics. Flat, plain, and generally hard to see, the athlete models are as bland as you could ever imagine. Looking no different from one another with the exception of a couple of color changes, it's often hard to tell which surfer you are out there (even when selecting the token woman player or the under-age Jon Jon!). Furthermore, the camera angles are so unusually far out in the distance that you can barely make out any of the details at all. One of the first games I've played in a long time that actually gave me some form of eyestrain, I spent most of my adventure on the seas seriously pissed off.  Even worse is that unlike in most games, where the fact that the camera angles can be adjusted for comfort and distance as opposed to early blindness or a complete loss of awareness, Championship Surfer appears to want to torture you. For this rare moment in recorded history, it's a bigger pain in the ass to change views of alternating lengths than to stay put and not touch anything. Too close to see anything but your poorly constructed wetsuit in the zoom feature, and too far to see anything but ant-like creatures moving around the waves in the farther angles, it's best to stick with the already visually difficult preset (not that you'll like that one any better).  Another bothersome tidbit in our list of eye scratching annoyances has to be the apparently random obstacle course thrown into the middle of many a surfing heat. Out of nowhere, your character will suddenly come face to face with a ton of misplaced objects floating in the middle of the course. While most of the objects are too vague to be recognized (chalk another one up for a poorly done graphics engine), the one thing we can make out is severely off the wall. What in the hell are a bunch of World War II-era Normandy caltrops doing in the middle of a surfing competition anyway? I just don't get it.  And how about those play modes? Basically the same exact option repeated infinitely with only the slightest crumb of a difference, the Time Trials, Arcade mode, and Career settings are almost identical to each other. Pull of a bunch of half-assed tricks in the allotted time, before your opponent does, or until you reach the predetermined score and you win! But who cares? You're doing the same thing over and over again on a set of beaches that are so similar; they may as well have been the same damned stage! Yippee!  Not that the control does us any big favors either. Definitely one of the most difficult to maneuver sports games in all of human accomplishment, Championship Surfer isn't about doing tricks on your board, oh no! It's about seeing how long you can stay afloat on a terribly crested wave before falling into the depths of the ocean for the umpteenth time. Are you sure this wasn't supposed to be a drowning simulation? Maybe if it was I could understand why it's easier to gulp two liters of water than pull off a simple jump. Alas it is not a simulation for the most thrashful of deaths, and we are left here scratching our heads in monkey-like wonderment.  Although you could blame my not so enjoyable time on the very steep learning curve (and I'm talking about Everest here folks), I tend to think otherwise. After a couple of hours of boredom and more wipeouts than Psygnosis could ever hope to sell in forty lifetimes, I was convinced that the problem was more than a passing tidbit. With poor responsiveness, backwards steering, and terribly structured stunt combinations I just couldn't take it anymore. To use a popular term reserved for the most successful of vacuum cleaners... it sucked.  And while I could struggle to think of more ways to go on and on about how bad an experience Championship Surfer really was for me, I will instead leave you with this helpful piece of pleasant information; The game is actually quite difficult to find, and we haven't seen it anywhere for sale other than a solitary stint in the used games bin at the local Babbages store. Feels good doesn't it? Go in peace my children, go in peace.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 13, 2000"}
