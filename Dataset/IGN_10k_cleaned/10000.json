The Virtual Console is already home to several great side-scrolling brawlers, with classic franchises like Final Fight, Streets of Rage and Golden Axe all well represented. And if you're a fan of that style of gameplay, chances are you've already downloaded one or more of those titles  so there's little reason, then, for you to consider Riot Zone, which is a generic, bland and boring knock-off of many of those better games' ideas.    Your hero in this adventure is the most uninspired you're ever likely to see, a New York City cop named Hawk who's wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. That's it. His partner, Tony, is a bit more creatively designed and comes equipped with a mohawk, red leather suit and star-shaped tattoos on his forehead, but is equally uninteresting once you get into the action  the pair of heroes are on a mission of justice into the gang-controlled territory called ~the Dragon Zone,~ because, of course, Hawk's girlfriend has been kidnapped.   The gameplay is exactly as you'd expect and totally par for the course for the brawling genre. You walk to the right side of the screen, enemies appear to oppose you, you defeat them and then resume walking further right. At the end of each stage, a boss encounter faces you down. You pick up food items to restore your health, other items like money increase your score, et cetera, et cetera.   Impromptu jump contest ... go!  Nothing new, nothing inventive. And the relative boredom of the basic design continues into Tony and Hawk's (Tony, Hawk ... there's a skateboarding joke in there somewhere) fighting styles, which are appalling limited and basic. You can throw straight punches, or combinations of three punches in a row by repeatedly pressing the attack button. You can execute a jump kick. You can throw foes. And that's it for the basic repertoire  beyond that you can also utilize a health-depleting ~killer move~ to do more flashy damage to your enemies, but that's nothing that Streets of Rage didn't already do too.   And the enemies are all the same five or six characters throughout the whole game, given recolored sprites every once in a while but rarely deviating from what you see in the game's first couple of stages. The final level in Riot Zone actually features no new foes at all  they're all just repeats of the same enemies from the prior stages.   So it's hard to find redeeming value in any of this so far, because Riot Zone never innovates or sets itself apart in any way in its gameplay. And even more upsetting is the game's lacking level of challenge  it's way too easy. Having never played it before a newcomer could still pick up the controller and clear the entire experience in less than an hour. There's a difficulty adjuster, but even the hardest setting isn't all that tough.   There might be something positive to say about Riot Zone's soundtrack, because this is a game that originated on the TurboGrafx-CD system and, like other TGCD games to hit the VC, its music is of notably high quality. There are some great electric guitar riffs in here, and the sound is energetic throughout the entire journey through the Dragon Zone  some tracks repeat themselves in later levels, though, so even this positive quality has its own negative aspect in place.   Oh, and there's no two-player co-op either. Seriously, what were they thinking with this one?Riot Zone is a title that was developed and released in the early '90s on the off chance that it might capitalize on the popularity of the brawling genre that was in place at the time. And while a handful of TurboGrafx-CD owners likely purchased and enjoyed it back then in that context, today it's just lost any last bit of the appeal it might have once had. Your 800 Wii Points are far better spent on pretty much any other brawler currently on sale in the Wii Shop  skip this one and look instead to a game like Streets of Rage 2.", "date": "Feb 8, 2008"}
