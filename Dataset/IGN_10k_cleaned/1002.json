But it's now June of the year 2000 and the definitive real time strategy game for the PC is finally, after at least half a dozen announced release dates, here to be touched, loved and played with. This game is in a unique position as it makes its way to everyone's favorite Nintendo console. Fans of the PC original hold this game in such high regard that it's almost sacred. So what's the best way to evaluate such a title when it comes home, exclusively we might add, to the console market? The dilemma comes from the fact that the multiplayer network game was the heart and soul of StarCraft and that's automatically taken away on the N64. If we were talking Dreamcast or PS2 here, with both of those systems on the brink of a new world of online console gaming, we could be more excited.  But the truth is, all of the action in SC64 will take place right in front of you, in your television, with your one gaming buddy sitting right beside you.   While the paring down of the multiplayer game limits the appeal of StarCraft 64 dramatically --like having Helen Keller on your team in charades-- Mass Media has done an admirable job of working within the N64's capabilities to bring SC to the N64 in recognizable shape. However, this is still one Nintendo published title that's far below the standard the Big N has set for its games.   The Background SC64 combines the storylines and elements from both StarCraft and the Brood War expansion set for the PC. Three races, Zerg, Terran and Protoss, are locked in an intergalactic battle that rages across a variety of planets and conditions. The multiple, intertwined, twisting stories are as deep as any game you'll find on the N64. While the stories of courage, deception and destruction are similar across all three races, the battles that you will be involved in will put you in close contact with all three races and their very specific differences.   This uniqueness to each species was what drew PC gamers to StarCraft in droves in 1998. It's not simply a matter of this species can use ray gun X and that species can use ray gun Y, it's that you will see the consistency of each race's culture in their specific weapons, buildings and style of combat. That is the Terrans are recognized for their inherently human ability to adapt to whatever conditions may present themselves. Therefore you see that the majority of Terran structures can be moved to safer locations if things get too hot; they have the greatest number of specialized ground soldiers and their technology is nicely balanced between defensive and offensive strategies. The Zerg tend to rely on sheer numbers and collective savagery rather than complicated technology and targeted attacks. The Protoss have some of the most expensive units in the war, but their deep faith affords them a sturdiness that can keep them in battles much longer than you'd expect, launching precision attacks.  Gameplay The balance of the three races is the what sets StarCraft apart from other RTS games on the PC or console for that matter. This is evident even in the single player game. Success invariably depends on how well you use the units rather than how many you can create or how powerful they are. On the other hand, researching and upgrading both ground and air troops and vehicles is critical to victory as is finding the right compliment of units to take into battle. And we can't forget about resource management either. When Mr. X told us in JFK that the ~organizing principal for any society is for war,~  he was giving us a tip on how to ensure victory in StarCraft. The beauty of StarCraft is that there isn't just one thing you can focus on and be successful. In a nutshell, you have to supply your military with plenty of money and natural resources, keep your army as technologically advanced as possible, defend your infrastructure, and incapacitate your opponents. And all of this has to be done within the cultural framework of whatever race you're playing. Simple.   In the single player game you'll be presented with six missions paths. You're getting the 10 missions per race from the original StarCraft plus the missions for each race from the Brood War Expansion Pak. By our count that should be 57 missions including the one secret mission from Brood War. There are also some nice tutorial scenarios to get the rookies up to speed. By the time you finish this game, you'll have the entire story of the StarCraft universe down. Furthermore, should you become bored of the missions at any point, there are a variety of standalone battle scenarios, against 1, 2, 3, or 4 computer opponents available for you. You can even set up your own custom battle scenario where you get to choose from one of 27 maps and up to four opponents.   The types of missions vary from simple escorting to King of the Hill  to a plain and simple ~Wipe them out...all of them.~ Needless to say, you'll appreciate and enjoy some missions more than others, but there is a sort of method to the madness. Many of the early missions for a particular race won't have you organizing your society for war at all. You'll simply have a ragtag group of troops --sometimes there will be somebody important with you, sometimes you'll pick them up on the way-- and all you have to do is get from point A to point B. The problem is between A and B there's a truckload of enemies hell bent on stopping you. These types of missions are more or less to teach you how to maneuver your guys during the heat of battle when there are all kinds of noises, explosions and screams of pain going on. You'll appreciate this training by the time you're ready to wage all out war.  Multiplayer The single player game is certainly a satisfactory experience for those who haven't dabbled in the StarCraft universe on PC first. However the two player games require some explaining. You can go head to head against a friend, but --and this is the ultimate weakness of StarCraft 64-- you will both have intimate knowledge of each other's activities thanks to the split screen. IGN64 has never commanded a real war, but we've always though that the secrecy and unpredictability of what your opponent is going to do was one of the unwritten rules. In StarCraft for the N64, you don't have to prepare yourself for anything, because eventually you'll be able to catch a glimpse of your opponents base and troops and you'll know exactly what you need to prepare for. While this doesn't relieve you of the responsibility to actually build and prepare in a timely manner, you won't get the same sense of anxiety you get when you have no idea what the other side is doing. When you battle the computer, you can't see what it's doing until you go and check it out for yourself and you're on edge the whole time because of this.   Since the split screen does eliminate the secrecy element, you will be left with a different sort of challenge when playing your friend. It becomes a game of who's better. Just because you see he's got eight tanks ready to roll, you still have to find a way to counter his move or even his non-move. In single player games, both the Protoss and Terrans have ways of checking out enemy bases, but they each require some time, resources and risk. With the free intelligence in SC64's two player game, your battles will totally be broken down into matters of skill and courage since the element of surprise isn't a factor.   The co-operative multiplayer game however is a different story. You and a buddy still have to use a split screen, but you're both in control of your army. The obvious problem is that you can both end up trying to make the same unit do the same thing, so communication between the two of you is important. It's best to divide up duties somehow so that your paths won't cross and to make sure you have plenty of resources so that you can each put into motion whatever twisted little plans you come up with. The best part about the co-op game is that while one player takes an army to battle against the enemies, the other player can be restocking troops, vehicles and supplies so that you can sustain your attack.  The co-operative mode is different from the multiplayer team mode where you still have two players on a split screen but you each get your own army and base. You simply choose the number of enemies you want to go against and whether or not how everyone's going to be allied.   Control Mass Media should be commended for the excellent job the company did in converting mouse and keyboard controls to the analog stick and umpteen button controls on the N64 controller. While you are limited in several ways, you can still hot-key groups to one button for easy access and there are the equivalent of right mouse click functions. By limitations we mean that you can't have 10 groups or buildings hot-keyed. You can map four groups, one to each C-button, so that you can get to them quickly.   However, there are certain changes in control that would've made the PC game downright unfair. By squeezing Z trigger and R at the same time, you bring up a master control menu. In this menu you can access every building and upgrade function in the game without having to select the building or worrying about where to find what. When you call up this menu you can go under ~Ground Upgrades~ where you'll find the every upgrade available for ground troops and vehicle. Of course you can only select the upgrades that your buildings and add-ons will allow, but this is a tremendous timesaver in the heat of battle. Furthermore, if you have multiple unit producing buildings like a barracks for example, using the master control menu will allow you to order up as many troops as your buildings can support. If you have three barracks you can order up fifteen troops since the master menu will simply switch to the next barracks in line once the queue in the first one is filled up. This system of managing is easy only if you have plenty of money and Vespene gas available to pay for everything you want and if you have enough supplies to support the additional troops and vehicles.   Also there are several shortcuts Mass Media has taken to allow gamers to pickup and play right away. When you build gathering units, probes, drones or SCVs, they will automatically begin to gather resources without a command from you. This would've been one hell of a gift to have on the PC version.   Despite the limitations, the control scheme is extremely useful and even makes for a somewhat new StarCraft experience. One complaint though, can't be helped. Using the control stick for such detailed moves as picking one soldier out of a group of 12 can really try your patience.   Graphics Alas, this is the second area where SC64 falls painfully short of its PC heritage. The sprites, the ground troops in particular, are super blurry and may be hard to recognize for newcomers. IGN has some veteran StarCraft players and even we had a tough time distinguishing red marines from red firebats. Recognizing troops at a glance is critical in this game and this shortcoming can affect your enjoyment of the game.   Even though the game is not in 3D there's considerable slowdown as you go through the motions. Considering that StarCraft is a game that's meant to have all kinds of things moving about simultaneously, stuttering animations can really get in your way. It's not so bad that you'll actually miss events going on in the game, but it is annoying to have a constant sluggish feeling while playing.   The slow animation of the game, the overall blurry look and the extremely rough FMV sequences will only frustrate fans of the PC game. StarCraft wasn't loved for its graphics to begin with, but on the N64, the look and feel is such a step down that it wouldn't be fair if we didn't warn fans of the PC games considering this version. We know there's going to be a sacrifice in graphics going from PC to N64, but when you're starting off with one of the uglier PC games around from two years ago, we'd hope it'd be a little less noticeable.  Sound As underwhelming as the graphics are, we were surprised at how good some of the sound came out. The N64 isn't known for its sound processing abilities and StarCraft's personality lives through the grunts, screams, acknowledgements and battle sounds of its soldiers, creatures and vehicles.   Every time you select something, be it a building or unit, you get a response out of it. The Zerg mainly growl, ooze and bubble, but the Protoss and Terrans yack it up all day long. The difference is that in the PC game each unit had a set of 4-5 responses when you selected them, in SC64 you get two. In our books that certainly better than none, and the flavor of the game still come through.   Similarly the music is limited. The ambient background tunes in the PC game did a nice job of getting you in the mood of the game. In SC64 you'd better like the music because you're going to hear it over and over again.   One thing that we miss hearing is the voice acting on the briefings and missions. Everyone talks in StarCraft and taking words out of their mouths and replacing it with text just isn't the same. The charm of the accents of the different Terrans is completely lost now that you have to read all of their lines.    I'm one of those that holds StarCraft near and dear to my heart so I was apprehensive about the N64 version as soon as it was announced. There was no way they'd fit all of that game into an N64 version and have it play the same. Well they didn't and it doesn't. However, this doesn't mean that SC64 is a total loss. It easily surpasses Command & Conquer as the best strategy game on the N64 and the upcoming OgreBattle 64 will do better in the RPG category than strategy category in the N64 library. The game looks like a struggling knockoff of the great PC original, even with Expansion Pak support (Nintendo is trying a new one on us this time, SC64 is ~Designed for N64 Expansion Pak~). The good thing is the backbone of StarCraft is still intact so that all of the strategy and depth is still there to be enjoyed. Slick and polished, this game absolutely is not. However, if you forgive and forget its looks, you will find yourself drawn in and addicted in no time. A few rental nights will definitely tell you if this game is for you however.", "date": "Jun 10, 2000"}
