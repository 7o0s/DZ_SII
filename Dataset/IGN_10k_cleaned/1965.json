I can't speak for their console careers, but whenever the Army Men hit the Game Boy system it's usually a treat, not a horror -- and on the Game Boy Advance, the game is definitely better than the average GBA launch title. Though the past few Army Men games were handled by Digital Eclipse, the first GBA adventure was handled by DC Studios -- there's definitely room for improvement for these little guys' Advance portable adventure, but it's a good first shot that can be expanded upon in the GBA's lifetime. Features 12 missions Two playable characters Password save Only for Game Boy Advance   The Game Boy Advance premier for these little guys is a bit of a deviation from the other Army Men games, both in look and in gameplay. Though it's still an overhead-style game on the GBA, it's no longer a slow-paced strategic design. Instead, it's a game much like the classic Commando, or better yet, Midway's Smash TV follow-up, Total Carnage. Take your pick between two characters (it doesn't matter which, both characters play the same). 12 different missions lie ahead, and it's all about blasting your way through the onslaught of Tan enemies, completing mission objectives to get to the next round. Your character can run and shoot in eight directions, and with the R button pressed it'll lock your guy facing in the current direction to strafe, making targeting enemies a lot easier to pull off.   The game's a bit of fun, but it's a serious challenge because you only get one life bar -- once it's gone, the game's over and you'll have to start over from the beginning of the mission. The early missions are of the simple ~blast everything that moves, and others that don't~ type, opening doors by flicking or shooting switches on the wall. Later on, you'll have to get through mazes and corridors without getting nailed by alien ~guards,~ control a gunboat in the bathtub, and play a game of Frogger, in the backyard creek. The Game Boy Advance's sprite capabilities are put to good use in the game -- in some levels you'll be attacked from all sides by as many as 10 soldiers.  The final boss level is probably the biggest stain on the game design, as it's seriously anticlimactic -- he's a breeze to beat...and the ending is nothing more than a congratulations and a credit scroll that can be accessed from the Game Options anyway.  Graphically, the title throws away any realistic imagery, offering a more cartoony, animated look for the game's characters and environments. Character animations are a little stiff and clumsy, and there aren't a whole lot of variety to the enemies that attack your characters. Though the game is very stylized, the background graphics could have been enhanced with a little more ~oomph~, as some levels look just flat-out bland...almost no detail to please the eyes.  Collision detection could have also used a tweak or two, as you'll find yourself getting hit by fast moving vehicles in the second level without even being on the road...and your character will fall into the creek too often, even when you think you've taken the proper steps. The sound is a little on the weak side, too, as during the game you'll get nothing but gunfire and the same ~ARGH!~ speech samples when an enemy bites the big one. The only background music comes at the title screen with its military theme that sounds like it was ripped out of Hogan's Heroes.    The game is a decent first shot on the Game Boy Advance, but it does feel a bit rushed. It has a few glitching problems when the screen fades in and out, and the ending after playing through the levels is very unsatisfying. Still, I'm looking forward to DC Studio's next game on the handheld, as their first isn't too bad at all.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
