Whoever came up with this wisdom didn't count on companies like EA, who, although active on both consoles and PC, insist on porting their PS2 sports titles to Xbox. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing since EA's PS2 games are generally very good, it means that you can pretty much forget about major enhancements that really bring out what the Xbox can do -- unless you're willing to wait six months for the port. F1 2001 is no different. The recently released PS2 racer has been faithfully brought to Xbox by Scottish developer Visual Sciences, delivering a barely enhanced but still thoroughly enjoyable Formula One racing experience.  Gameplay The F1 season may be over, but Xbox owners can relive every minute of it with EA's F1 2001. Like the PS2 version it's based on, F1 2001 lets you pick from all 22 drivers and 11 teams of the 2001 season, complete with up-to-date sponsor decals (minus cigarette advertisers, of course), and take them through the complete 17-track Grand Prix. But before you get to experience what it feels like to floor your gas pedal on the Hockenheim Ring or navigate the winding streets of Monte Carlo, your first stop is most likely going to be F1 2001's innovative Challenge Mode. Get this: before you can drive a complete championship or even switch gears to manual you have to prove that you can do it. I have to admit that when I first booted up the game, I was dumbfounded. ~I can't drive a full championship on manual with FIA rules, random weather, and car damage without having to complete license tests? Hello, EA, there are some people who have played F1 racing games before, you know...~ Don't worry, it sounds more annoying than it really is.   Although primarily designed to protect beginners from getting confused by all the setup options, the Challenge Mode actually turns into a fun little bonus that helps you familiarize yourself with the controls and feature list. For example, earning the ability to pick manual gear shifting will take a normal player something like two minutes. Simply go to the Manual Transmission challenge and complete it within the specified time limit and you're done. Depending on your completion time, you are then awarded a medal (bronze, silver, gold) and your overall progress percentage goes up. Want to play with car damage? Complete a challenge in which you must drive a car with a damaged front wing back to the pits. You can even drive a track experience challenge on each track that disqualifies you if you leave the track. Opening up all the options should be a cinch for anyone with a little bit of F1 (game) racing experience, but you'll have to work hard if you want to get gold medals on all challenges. Apart from basic gameplay options, completing challenges also opens additional Grand Prix modes, like Custom Championship, Full Championship, Teammate Challenge, or the expert Domination mode that requires you to grab pole for every race. So what initially seemed like an annoying limitation actually turned out to be a worthwhile feature that I'd love to see in the next game as well (it'd be nice if I can carry over my save, though -- I don't want to have to unlock the basic options again).  The core of the game of course remains the Full Championship and F1 2001 does an admirable job at recreating the weekend event for each race. After an informative introduction to the track thanks to color commentary by ITV's Jim Rosenthal, players have their choice of driving a few practice laps, qualifying, warm-up, or can jump right to Sunday's GP race. While practice and warm-up are all about setting up your car (via text-only menus that get the job done but won't win any awards for presentation), EA did a great job at making the qualifying session as fun as the final race. Like in real life, you can expect traffic on the track as the other drivers leave the pits to qualify. You have one hour to drive your best lap time and achieve your best possible grid position for the actual race. You can race a lap, then drive back to the pits and see how well the other drivers are performing (you can fast-forward time in the pits and watch the lap times), then go out again to improve yourself and secure your position. Once you're done, it's time for the main course.  Control and handling in F1 2001 are as easy or complicated as you want them to be. You can select from normal and simulation handling (the latter allows for locking brakes, more realistic handling and doesn't prevent the car from spinning), as well as speed assists and traction control. Thanks to the Xbox's analog triggers, the game controls very well. Unlike on the PS2, where you had to use the second analog stick for decent gas/brake control, the Xbox's shoulder buttons make for a much better racing feel. You can alternatively use the right stick as your accelerator and shift with the shoulder buttons, but the default control (A/B: Gears, X: reverse) works much better. I have only one issue with the control setup and that's the choice of the white button to look behind you. Since only the bumper cam (and not the two excellent cockpit views) features a rearview mirror, it doesn't make sense that Y is used as an instant replay button whereas look behind is placed above it on a harder to reach button. I can't count how many times I have accidentally interrupted the race with an instant replay when trying to look to the back. Speaking of which, the replay function is pretty much worthless. You can interrupt your race to replay the last few seconds of the race, but you can't see any replays after the race ends. The Xbox has a hard drive that can easily record more than a few seconds of replay data. Someone please use it.   While the driver AI doesn't exactly reflect the real drivers' style and performance, F1 2001 does an amazing job at recreating the look and feel of a real F1 race. Everything that happens in real life can happen in the game. I've lost my front wing on the last lap of a thrilling Suzuka GP finale, drove ~on fumes~ and barely made it into the pits on the Circuit de Spa, and lost miserably because of an engine failure in Monza. The game plays by basic FIA rules (if you turn them on), so even though the impressive damage effects are tempting, you're best served playing it safe when overtaking opponents. But collisions do happen, and you'll quickly find out that the game's damage system isn't just cosmetic. Driving a car with busted suspension or a bent axis can quickly turn the game from a race to the finish to a cruise to the pits. The game immediately brings up the yellow flag when ~incidents~ occur, but the programmers should have added some lenience when it comes to stop-go penalties. If you're involved in a crash and you happen to skid past another driver as a result of the impact, you're fined with a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. The same doesn't seem to happen to AI drivers, though. On the upside, the pit stop mechanics are pretty cool. If you switch interactive pit stops on, driving into the pit lane requires you to go through some Shenmue-style button presses. The quicker and more accurately you perform them, the faster your pit crew works when changing tires or refueling.   As much as I'd liked to have played this game during the actual season, it's the perfect thing to tide me over until the next season starts. EA has done a remarkable job making what for the uninitiated comes across as boring on TV, an exciting event to experience. Yes, it's a port of the PS2 version, but the use of the Xbox controller's analog shoulder buttons alone makes this the superior version. The package is rounded off by a variety of fun multiplayer modes ranging from consecutive ~party mode~ style challenges to four-player split-screen races (sorry, no link-up for all you spoiled multi-Xbox owning millionaires).  Graphics Let's face it, real race tracks aren't all that exciting -- visually speaking -- but F1 2001's designers did a great job recreating the tracks as accurately as possible. That's not an easy task, mind you. Unlike most racing games (NASCAR excepted), F1 games can't get away with having only six cars on screen at one time. The engine needs to be able to handle up to 22 cars at once on tracks that often contain long straights and plenty of trees. It's not surprising then that like so many F1 games, F1 2001 suffers in the framerate department. What is annoying, though, is that the Xbox version wasn't improved over the PS2 version. Although the game generally runs at 30 fps, things get choppy after sharp turns or when driving in the rain. If you put both versions side by side, you'll notice that the Xbox version features better textures, less jaggies, a few added elements (like a helicopter in the air), but also a slightly blurrier look due to the anti-aliasing. We've seen the kinds of textures Xbox is capable of in games like Halo, so the somewhat drab look of F1 2001 is a bit disappointing.  Luckily, the game packs a huge amount of both flashy and subtle effects, such as trees that sway in the wind, heat distortion, reflections, smoke, rain, and the like (but no sparks). The cars also properly interact with the track, leaving skid marks, slipping on wet rumble strips, or picking up dirt or grass particles if you happen to leave the track. The attention to detail really becomes apparent when you're playing with one of two cockpit modes. The first, which lets you see everything from the driver's eyes, shows you your hands on the steering wheel, complete with working indicators and gear shift animation. The second view mimics the onboard camera you'll see in TV broadcasts and sits right behind the driver. In this mode you can see slightly more of the track, as well as your driver's head bobbing left and right and him removing tear-off strips from his helmet whenever his view gets clouded. Nice. The game also features fully animated pit crews and crowds, but inexplicably, no victory celebration sequences after winning a race or championship.  Sound The audio in F1 2001 is a mixed bag. While the gear and engine noises sound like the real deal, everything outside the car doesn't quite deliver. From far too quiet engine noises at the starting grid to the unconvincing Doppler effects from the other cars, the game could have sounded a lot better with the help of some authentic race samples for the background audio. A word of caution to those of you who run your Xbox audio through a 5.1 receiver. The sound mapping in this game is a bit rear-heavy. For example, most of the engine noise in the in-cockpit view is mapped to the rear speakers. Sounds logical, since the engine's in the back, right? Yep, but it drowns out much of the rest of the soundtrack and lessens the impact of surround effects like approaching cars behind you. More careful separation (using the L/R channels for most of your engine, with more subtle signals sent to the back) would have improved things a lot. For example, drivers hear pit audio in their helmets, so have that come from the rear speakers. There is no reason the pre-race commentator should be in the back as well -- that's what the center speaker is for. Overall, the game sounds convincing enough and brings F1 to life in your living room with screeching engines, buzzing rumble strips and realistic pit commentary. But some more experimentation with sound mapping and filters (driving through Monaco's narrow streets and tunnel should sound a lot different than a race on the more open tracks, for example) could have yielded an even better package.F1 2001 made the transition from PS2 well as a competent but unspectacular port. Given the added power of the hardware, the Xbox version should look a lot better -- but it doesn't. As a matter of fact, the game's load times are actually longer on Xbox -- an unforgivable fact considering that the machine's got a hard drive. On the flipside, F1 2001 remains an extremely fun and accessible F1 racer that uses its official license nearly perfectly. Given the post-2001 season release, it would have been nice if the game had used actual 2001 qualifying times or actual events -- but that's just a minor quibble. The cars look great, all the drivers and tracks are here, the pre-race color commentary is intelligent and informative, and most importantly, the races are exciting and all the modes are fun to play. I'll be first in line next year to buy the sequel.", "date": "Dec 11, 2001"}
