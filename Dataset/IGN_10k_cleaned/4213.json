{"name": "Rayman Bowling", "name_review": "Rayman Bowling", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/rayman-bowling", "text": "Even though its creator has moved on to other pastures (the exquisite Beyond Good and Evil), the character of Rayman endures. After slogging through three long adventures, through day-glo lands that look the neighboring commuties to Druggaschusettes, the limbless wonder needed to take break. And how does the man with phantom limb syndrome choose to unwind? Why, with a bowling ball in his hand, of course.  Features:  Fantasical lanes based on the wacky Rayman universe Real bowling rules, sucka!  Anytime you see a mascot applied to a sports or racing game, you immediately hope against hope that the license is used appropriately and convincingly. For every Mario Party, there's a Disney's Party. For every Crash Team Racing, there's a Woody Woodpecker Racing. And for every Mario Golf, there's a Disney Sports Football.  Well, with great relief, we can say that Rayman Bowling from Gameloft doesn't trip up in the pitfalls of hastily slapped-together licensed games. Sure, there is plenty of fantastical trimmings in Rayman Bowling, but by keeping the actual bowling part of the game true, Gameloft steps around any potential hazards.  Now, there are plenty of fantasy elements to keep one foot of Rayman Bowling firmly in Ubi Soft's magical realm, but you have to complete a regular game of bowling first if you want the keys to the kingdom. In order to unlock the goofball courses, you must secure a decent score in a normal round of bowling. Then Rayman Bowling turns into more of a, well, Rayman experience, complete with flowery lanes, lava-filled gutters, and traps that can ruin your chances for a turkey.  Yes, the world of Rayman does not let you off easy when you're trying to line up with the eight pin to finish off a spare. Little mouths in the lane will try to screw with your ball, so you need to master Rayman Bowling's controls if you want to avoid a pitiful score.  The control is great, as even a total bananahands can get somewhere in the 140 range. (A 300 is not out of the question, but it is on the difficult side. The very difficult side.)  First you move Rayman back and forth along the base of the lane until he's where you want him. Then, an arrow system pops up and you have to carefully choose the proper trajectory to get the ball down the lane appropriately. Finally, a meter allows you to choose the amount of ~oomph~ you want behind the ball.  The lanes are designed after levels in the original Rayman game. The fire level looks like the lava caverns. The music level is complete with notes in the background. The flowery lane looks exactly like the first level that greets you in the original game. The colors are bright, and if you have a nice display (we tested on a Motorola T720), they really pop off the screen. There's a nice bit of audio in the game, but its nowhere quite the level of Gameloft's Rayman 3, released earlier this year. is a very clever distraction that is almost as engaging as JAMDAT Bowling, which still reigns as one of the biggest downloads in cellphone gaming. However, Rayman fans will likely steer themselves toward Gameloft's offering, as not only does it present a solid game of normal bowling, but it later rewards you with plenty of goodies and visual touches fromt he Rayman universe. Highly recommended for everybody from the casual cell gamer to people that live for that next download.", "date": "Nov 18, 2003"}
