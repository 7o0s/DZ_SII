Especially if the ideas behind the game are good solid ideas that shine with the original intent in a relevant way. The only bummer is that the Midway development teams almost always think up worthwhile ideas, which are implemented poorly or not fleshed out to their fullest extent.   Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run is a perfect example. Hooking up with Dwayne ~The Rock~ Johnson is always a winning situation; adding new gadgets and weapons to the Interceptor is also smart; even giving gamers melee and shooting systems can be considered smart moves. But none of these ideas are handled all that well, the production values are poor, and the third-person shooter controls aren't preferable. When cobbled together in the final product, they unfortunately don't make Midway's third modern remake of Spy Hunter worth your while.    Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run takes the series from the 3D phase its grown into (Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter 2), adds new weaponry, the Rock, who is playable as a third-person perspective action hero who can shoot, punch, and wrestle enemies, and a new set of 12 action-packed missions. With these alterations, Midway's once arcade-based driving game has transformed into something that closely resembles Electronic Arts' James Bond series. Now you have someone to play as, not just a car. Regularly getting out of the car in Spy Hunter means there is a person in that otherwise empty vehicle, something the series was definitely missing -- and The Rock is someone you can identify with and who you probably like. It's hard not to like the charismatic Rock. He's a tough-ass, muscle-bound hero ready for action. Midway has done a respectable job of re-creating Johnson as special agent Alex Decker, a former fighter pilot who's turned to government special agent. The story is nothing worth writing home about, but at least The Rock is there to lead the government against the evil NOSTRA corp., which is bent on stealing and re-tooling the Interceptor for its own sinister purposes.    Like I was saying, as a concept, most gamers would love to be The Rock. In Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run, it's cooler in theory than in practice. While the game's graphics and presentation feel cobbled together as if by a late night production editor who had better things to do, the Rock does retain a distinct resemblance, whether it's in CG cutscenes or in-game graphics. His image, voice, and dozens of little one-liners remind this reporter of early Schwarzenegger films -- his personality shines through even the dumbest of lines. Here, Johnson does a decent job with the lines he has and adds the necessary color the game so badly needed.     As Decker, you'll be surprised at the character's dexterity. He can walk, roll, crouch, duck, and both aim and shoot a gun. Not only that, but he's also able to perform wresting and melee moves. Whether on the PS2 or Xbox, when outside the car you'll move Decker with the left analog stick and aim with the right one. The controls are tight and slow and require some getting used to. Using the D-pad, you can toggle through weapons, picking up enemy guns after they're dead, and the range of weapons quickly goes from simple hand-guns and grenades to rifles, machine guns and shotguns, to rocket launchers. Midway's out of car level design is basic and almost non-descript: You run from room to room, killing guys, collecting items, finding keys, and then blasting through more rooms to get to the end. Interactive objects such as pipes and giant sledge hammers exist for those who want to switch from better to worse weaponry, but seeing the Rock slam some generic thug with a two-handed sledge hammer is worth seeing at least once.   The controls, unfortunately, are clumsy and slow. You'll never want to switch to the fun weapons in the heat of battle and, taking a certain amount of heat -- i.e. slugging through any encounter -- is generally the best way to handle every single battle. Thus making those occasional weapons useless. Barriers used for hiding behind often are poorly tagged with the appropriate collision detection, so they're inconsistent to hide behind, and most times it's easier to run into a room full steam and blast away instead of smartly, deftly eliminating enemies in your way. Nearly every room has a health or ammo pack, so help is always right around the corner. And the game automatically saves, keeping the action moving without menu screens interrupting each level.      If you've played any third-person shooters, however, you're aware of the issues surrounding the use of this perspective. Not only are these controls sluggish and awkward, there are no precise or advanced controls or options. The wall-hugging ability is OK, but it doesn't make this perspective any more fun. The few likeable ideas that are well implemented are The Rock's melee and wrestling moves. When not equipped with a weapon, Decker can throw a basic or strong attack, and the latter of the two, when connected to an enemy's face, sounds like a .44 magnum going off, exaggerated and over-the-top (and very satisfying!). The grab/throw button (A on Xbox, X on PS2) is always a knockout. Contact sensitive with the position of the enemy's body, this move ranges in style. Decker might pick up an enemy and throw him off a cliff or a boat. He may wrestle them into a back-breaker, slam them with a Rock Bottom, or pull off other wrestling moves. Decker can also pull off combos and finishers, when enemies are stunned. These add a nice touch to the melee attacks and are worth pulling off regularly. These are slow to implement, so you might take damage while pulling them off, but they always kill the enemy and they're great fun to pull off and watch. While a number of other issues might drag down Nowhere to Run, Midway handled these really well, from the animation to the motion capture to the implementation of the controls.     Getting back into the Interceptor is often a welcome relief from the repetitive slog of mowing down NOSTRA dummies. Like the previous games, driving the Interceptor is a fast, weapon-heavy experience. All of the basic attacks are back: the smoke-screen, oil slicks, machine guns, rockets, and ground-to-air missiles. The Weapons Van returns for mid-level re-supplies, and you'll hear HQ chime in with chatter to set-up a new scenario or warn you of some impending doom. Newly added weapons feature the tire spikes (which the enemies always had), which shred not only the enemy car tires, but their entire car, and the newly implemented flares, secondary weapons, turret guns, and Salvo Mode, which is essentially bullet time. The idea behind Salvo mode is to slow time down so you can aim at a bunch of on-screen enemies. After a limited amount of time, time speeds up again and you launch rockets at the designated enemies, all of which explode in a firestorm of particles and fire.   The levels are often better designed than their predecessors, mixing a combination of car and boat transformations during the same run. You might drive for a minute, switch to the boat, switch back to the car, and end up on the boat again all in one continuous run. This continuous blending of both vehicle types changes up the otherwise predictable and linear nature of this type of game, and when you add in the motorcycle, which can slide, there is enough fresh stuff to mildly excite old and new fans alike.    Visually, however, it's tough to feel good about the way Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run looks and sounds. If Midway had paid as much attention to the rest of the game as it had to The Rock, this late-gen PS2 and Xbox game would have looked a whole lot better. Admittedly, it's difficult to not unconsciously compare any current gen game with a next-gen game, but even this now, with the beautiful Xbox and PS2 games that we've seen in the last year, Nowhere to Run makes one wince. The low res textures smart, but and the framerate is generally steady at around 30 FPS, but the generic character design hurt to such a degree that some government engineers look like DEVO wannabees (these guys die in a reactor explosion, and they look like real, albeit strangely likeable, tools).   The production values of the whole game are the most painful to watch. The cutscenes constantly cut into the game, interrupting any flow, and they seem deliberately intrusive, forcing you to feel like you're in an action movie. To a degree they work, but for the most part, they're roughly cut, even intrusive, and not altogether wanted. Midway does solid work with the game sound effects and voice-over work, but beware, there is so much shooting and exploding that you might not want your mom or girlfriend to be around. This game gets loud.The addition of a third-person controllable character to this otherwise entirely vehicle-based series adds an entirely new dimension to the fading series. Playing as The Rock is pretty dang fun, and even if some of the shooting controls are wonky, the melee and wrestling attacks remain consistenly hilarious and enjoyable. Overall, Midway's fifth game in this series is a passable title that isn't terribly compelling, but it's far from sucking. If you've already moved on to the Xbox 360 or are saving up for a PS3 (good luck!), skip this. If you're in the mood for mindless blasting and some decent racing fun -- oh, and you love the Rock -- this may be worth you while.", "date": "Sep 12, 2006"}
