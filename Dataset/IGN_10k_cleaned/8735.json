Tower Bloxx underlined Digital Chocolate's philosophy of delivering original, mobile-centric content rather than relying on licenses or ports. As such, the publisher did not rush into extending the Bloxx franchise, but over eighteen months later, though, Digital Chocolate has finally released the sequel: Pyramid Bloxx.   And it roxx.   (Sorry about that.)   I'll be straight about Pyramid Bloxx right up front: It's not better than Tower Bloxx, a game that is just as playable today as it was in late 2005. However, Pyramid Bloxx is so expertly crafted that any fan of Tower Bloxx will have great fun with this engaging spiritual successor.   Pyramid Bloxx is set in ancient Egypt, challenging players to build the three Great Pyramids one brick at a time. Blocks are hoisted from the bottom of quarries and mines by a series of workers obviously imbued with superhuman strength. These miners toss the blocks up one level at a time, huffing and puffing until the block is ultimately thrown on to a waiting cart at the top of the shaft. Throwing the blocks is not easy, because all miners run left and right when they catch it and some miners are faster and less reliable than others, such as donkeys and monkeys. Depending on the accuracy of the previous throw, the blocks may sway in the miner's hands, making it harder to toss farther up the chain with precision.   If you manage to launch the block precisely into the waiting miner's hands, you earn a point multiplier. Every subsequent good throw without running back and forth too many times keeps the multiplier going. You can also goose the multiplier by tossing the block up two levels with a single throw by using earned double-throws (activated by pressing the OK button twice). When your block reaches the top of the mine, the edges are polished. The higher your score, the more edges are polished, making it more valuable in the second half of the game, the strategic block placement.   To be honest, this throwing upwards mechanic is certainly reminiscent of Gamevil's Super Boom Boom (a game I truly enjoyed this year), but the theme, the addition of point multipliers, and the strategy element following each successful mining gig sets the two games far enough apart that I feel good about recommending a player download both.   After hoisting a block to the top of the mine, you must place the shiny piece into a pyramid graph. This is essentially like the city planning part of Tower Bloxx which put that game over the top. You can only place certain blocks next to each other, and as you get deeper into the game, you unlock powerful blocks like onyx that have very strict placement requirements. Certain blocks can only be placed next to a block with very particular polished edges. The goal is not just to fill in the pyramid, but to also make it the most valuable pyramid possible. This will require lots of block replacement and that's where Pyramid Bloxx earns its replay value.   However, this is also the part of the game that lacks the Tower Bloxx magic. There is a real enjoyment in building a city with happy citizens. Just placing shiny blocks into a static pyramid graph isn't as endearing. It's certainly functional, but that's about all it is. Fortunately, there are a few visual pay-offs for hitting milestones, as temples and obelisks rise from the desert when you place enough blocks in each of the three graphs. That helps a bit, but again, this part of the game lacks that ~Digital Chocolate~ touch.   Pyramid Bloxx also features an endless mode where you can throw a single block up the side of a pyramid instead of a mine. With each throw, the miners get harder to predict. There is a certain zen to this mode, much like the zen of Skipping Stone. This mode also features some really nice visual touches, such as lens flare when the sun dips behind the pyramid or the starry realm of the gods when you get high enough on the structure. After completing the pyramids twice, this became my preferred play mode. You will get a lot of mileage out of the endless challenge -- and it's almost worth buying the game for this mode alone.  Pyramid Bloxx continues Digital Chocolate's Pixar-like winning streak. This is an incredibly playable puzzle game with a lot of charm, although admittedly not as much as its forbearer, Tower Bloxx. The quarry sequences are great fun, but the pyramid-building strategy section falls a little short due to its static nature. Why not measure progress in a visual nature, like the happiness of the citizenry, like in Tower Bloxx or Tornado Mania? Regardless, Pyramid Bloxx is still one of the best games of 2006 so far and I cannot imagine a single mobile gamer that wouldn't get several hours of pleasure out of it.", "date": "Jun 30, 2007"}
