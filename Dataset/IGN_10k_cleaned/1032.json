Tail of the Sun is an intriguing mixture of simplistic gameplay and simulation that, while it may seem slow at times, is always interesting.  Set in the prehistoric past, Tail of the Sun allows you to take control of a caveman and help him evolve his tribe to a higher intelligence. The caveman               can eat, sleep, hunt, and explore the vast terrains for hours without               accomplishing a single thing - but the game manages to remain               addictive.  The world itself is huge, offering the entire globe to explore. Oceans can be swam across to reach unmarked islands, deserts can be trudged across, and plains can be run across. The globe wraps around, so you could conceivably go from one side to the other, and back again.  If the player makes all the right decisions, he or she will eventually               evolve his tribe into a better species. Hunting tools and better mental               and physical attributes will all make the path and motives for existence               so clear: build a tower of mammoth tusks to the sun.  Tail of the Sun is not a fast paced game, make no bones about it. It is a refreshingly slow, yet ultimately rewarding, gaming experience.", "date": "May 9, 1997"}
