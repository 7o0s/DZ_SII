That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.  Archimedean Dynasty is one of the worst names for a game ever.  I've played through it twice, and I still don't have a clue why the developers saddled their submarine combat game with this awkward title, which is never explained in the storyline.  At least it's better than the name it was known by in its home country of Germany.  Over there it is called Schleinfahrt, which just makes me think of people looking guilty in elevators.  Altavista translates this word to ~Creeping Travel~, which isn't much better.  The idea is similar to silent running, in which a submarine travels slowly to minimize the noise it's making and avoid detection by sonar.  But the title ~Silent Running~ was already taken by a Bruce Dern film about gardens in space.  Naming problems aside, Archimedean Dynasty is one of the finest Wing Commander clones since Chris Roberts invented the genre and then ruined it by making it obvious that what he really wants to do is direct.  You know how the genre goes: play a mission, watch a cutscene, play a mission, watch a cutscene, repeat until bored with either the missions or the cutscenes.  The problem is that it's hard to sustain the same level of interest in the combat and the storyline.  The series that has most effectively done this is Lucasarts' X-Wing/TIE Fighter line-up, but they had the advantage of licensing a universe that we all grew up with.  Second only to Lucasarts' games is Archimedean Dynasty, which uses an underwater setting to give us a fascinating game world and a compelling combat engine.  For a game that was released in 1996, the combat engine still looks pretty good.  Its creators at Massive Developments in Germany (not to be confused with Massive Entertainment, the Swedish guys who gave us Ground Control) released a 3Dfx patch that basically introduces bilinear filtering, but it also caused problems with textures disappearing on my computers with Voodoo 3 cards.  And, of course, it won't work with non-3Dfx chipsets.  But even unaccelerated, the combat in Archimedean Dynasty still looks good.  The graphics engine has an extremely short drawing range, which works because it's set underwater.  But it uses a system of sonar detection that lets you find many units before they're actually visible.  You can play cat and mouse by turning your sonar off and lingering outside your opponent's detection range.  There are some interesting missions with currents, in which you can shut down your engines and drift.  Various components can make your sub quieter and some torpedoes can even be spoofed if you launch a torpedo that's louder than your sub.  Unlike the precious few underwater games we've seen that may as well be space combat games, Archimedean Dynasty truly offers a journey to the bottom of the sea.  Some gamers will be impatient with the fact that there are some long missions that you can't save; if you fail, you have to play the whole thing over again (although many missions are optional).  The AI is pretty dumb and you can usually kill them all by just moving backwards and shooting the enemies that chase you, a trick as old as the original Battlezone.  It's easy to escape torpedoes by driving with your nose in the silt, which doesn't slow you down for some odd reason.  There's a handy inset screen with a voxel display that shows the terrain around your sub, making it easy to hide in canyons or dodge around hilltops.  But in any combat that takes you into open water, like some of the later missions against the Shogunate, you're going to be playing a whole new game.  Some of the sub design is really impressive and Archimedean Dynasty features, hands down, the best introduction of an alien race in any game I've played.  This more than makes up for an insipid Death Star climax with missions nearly as frustrating as X-Wing's trench runs.  But where the setting really comes alive is in the game's storyline, which takes place in a completely submerged post-Apocalyptic world.  The surface has been poisoned for hundreds of years and humanity has been trapped underwater, where they've built cities connected by jump points that sling giant ships through the ocean at speeds over 500mph.  Settlers cultivate protein around thermal vents and corporations manufacture breathing gas to sell to cities.  Powerful tornados on the surface will occasionally swirl harmful debris deep into the water.  People live in terror of the seaquakes that can breach the titanium shell of a city or the rare tsunamis that will sweep entire settlements away in a flash.  Smugglers traffic in oxygen, simulated daylight, and special pressurized champagne bottles.  A religious sect longs to return to the surface to glimpse sunlight again, inspired by stories of pilgrims who have glimpsed auroras through Arctic ice.  In the cave city of Atacama, you can actually stand on an earthen floor.  The scientists at Machine Antarctica are breeding Homo Aquaticus, a new species of water-breathing humans.  Archimedean Dynasty does a superlative job of building this world in your head and then moving you through it.  The manual is thick with backstory, but even if you don't read it, the game will slowly put the pieces together as you move through the storyline.  The mission structure gives you plenty of freedom to choose missions and travel around however you like, buying weapons and new components for your submarine.  You can even run guns for a profit.  There are about twenty cutscenes over the course of the game and between missions you explore different areas in each location.  Some of these will contain characters that offer information and missions.  The prose isn't particularly elegant, but Massive has come up with a compelling and interesting world well worth visiting.  It's a credit to Massive's talent that they create some memorable characters without ever showing anyone's face.  We can forgive them hard-boiled dialogue like, ~For me, freedom means more than just inhaling all the lavender-scented helionox I want~.  -- Tom ChickComment on this story Presentation  The campaign shell and cutscenes feature some beautiful artwork and the dialogue is good, if not sometimes on the ~hard-boiled but corny~ side.   8.0  Graphics  The technology is certainly dated, but it's not as bad as, say, the Build engine.  This game looks better than many other four-year-old titles.   6.0  Sound  Some haunting underwater ambiance and submarine engine noises, but the weapon effects practically scream ~generic laser blasts~.   6.0  Gameplay  At last, an underwater game that actually feels like it takes place underwater.   9.0  Lasting Appeal  The storyline is long and involved, taking several twists and offering a lot of optional missions.   8.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Dated graphics aside, it is easily one of the best combat sims you can get.   YES!!!  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   8.0 Archimedean Dynasty didn't do very well in the U.S., but Massive says they've sold over 100,000 copies in Germany.  Apparently they feel it was successful enough to start work on a sequel, tentatively titled Aqua.  Unfortunately, the market doesn't seem very interested in combat sims these days; mech titles and space combat games have been dropping like flies.  But maybe an updated version of Archimedean Dynasty called Aqua would be unique enough to stand out.  At the very least, it wouldn't have the disadvantage of being saddled with a title that makes it sound like a bargain bin bound Myst clone.", "date": "Aug 15, 2000"}
