Now that the Virtual Console has grown to nearly 60 titles in the just the first three months, however, things have changed a bit.  Soldier Blade, originally the sequel to Super Star Soldier on the TurboGrafx has followed suit once again, hitting the VC after its predecessor in an attempt to grab another $6 bucks from loyal Wii fans.  It's met with a bit more resistance this time around, however, as we've now got nearly a half dozen spaceship shooters, including classics such as Gradius, R-Type, and Space Harrier II.  Still, even with a killer list of downloadable shooters flooding the Wii Virtual Console, Soldier Blade is an awesome addition to the console, and a perfect fit for blazing fast top-view blasting.   Since Soldier Blade is the follow-up game to Super Star Soldier, the game obviously shares some design choices.  The game still makes use of speed control that can be changed on the fly for your ship (with the press of the minus button), it still bases itself around crazy top-view battles centered around a ton of ships and a hail of bullets, it still contains the two minute and five minute challenge modes, and you'll still be chasing down colored power-ups that will make or break your mission status.  Still, aside from the basic graphical design and mode layout, Soldier Blade does a ton to set itself apart from its predecessor, and many of the changes are for the better.          The first thing you'll notice with Soldier Blade is that this game is incredibly fast.  Rather than having three speed modes for your character the game allows only two, but when you pump the ship into overdrive you'll feel it.  Getting from one side of the screen to the other takes all of a second, and combining the eye-peeling speed with a ton of firepower will make you an instant threat against even the toughest baddies.  Should you crash and burn (and believe me, you will), Solider Blade no longer requires you to start the level over from the beginning, as it adopts the more traditional death/respawn formula of other shooters.     Where the game really sets itself apart form Super Star Soldier, however, is in the power-up structure.  The main strategy is still the same, which centers around gathering multiples of the same colored power-up to ramp up a specific type of firepower, but there's an added level of depth to it all that Super Star Soldier just didn't have.  When the first power-up is collected, an neighboring ship (similar to the ~option~ in Gradius) swoops in and adds to your firepower.  In addition, one of three slots are filled in the bottom right of the screen.  Picking up new power-ups will automatically switch your firepower on the fly, pushing your current power-up into the next slot over.    So while the standard power-up system still works along the same lines, the wingman is now free-flying along with your ship, and extra power-ups are actually cached for later use should you need them.  As the final hook to the system, each power-up can actually be chashed in and used as a bomb, which gives specific traits to either your primary ship or your wingman.  Some attacks boost your firepower for a short time, while others send the secondary ship into a whirlwind of melee attacks.  The idea of sacrificing primary fire for a kill-all is an awesome idea, and it works well when combined with different cached weapons.  For true top-view shooter junkies out there the $6 may be worth it simply to see this power-up system in action.   As for the game's overall presentation, Soldier Blade mops the floor with Super Star Soldier's original design, offering stronger effects, more realized level design, the aforementioned power-up system, a strong audio effort, and a few key gameplay options as well.  Weapon power-ups are grander, the enemy design is more intricate, and visual effects show a definite step up from the previous game.  In addition, Soldier Blade includes both a normal and hard mode, a new score challenge mode, and the ability to display the game in its original aspect ratio (simply called ~vertical mode~).  Soldier Blade may not have the amazing style and visuals of current-day shooters, but it definitely has gameplay to spare.  The power-up system offers just enough depth to keep things interesting, the games presentation is fast and crisply detailed, and the added modes make it a much better choice for top-view shooters than the previously-released Super Star Soldier.  Soldier Blade is still one player, but the added challenge modes and long-lasting single player campaign (the full arcade mode is around an hour long, which is great for the TurboGrafx era) makes it well worth the $6 price tag.  Stingy VC shoppers may want to stick to R-Type III and wait for the impending Gradius III (or LifeForce series, should we get that down the line), but if youve got 600 Wii points to share, suffer from the blast-a-mass disease (clinically referred to as A.D.D.), and are looking for a fun time-waster to dip in and out of over the next few months, Soldier Blade is a solid choice.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
