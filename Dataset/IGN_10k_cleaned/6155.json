Hasbro's filling an ignored niche, so don't be surprised if you see a couple game shows topping the best-selling list this season. First up: Jeopardy.  Jeopardy, in its most basic form, is a quiz show where the answers are given, and three players go against each other and ~buzz in~ to respond to the clue with a question. Each ~answer~ has a money value based on its difficulty. Answer it correctly, get the money. But answer it wrong, and have it subtracted from your score. Games are broken down into three parts: Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Final Jeopardy. Players compete for money answering questions (er, questioning answers  I'm never going to get used to that) in Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy, and wager their winnings for one final question in Final Jeopardy. Which ever player has the most money at the end of the game wins.   Jeopardy on the PlayStation, like Wheel of Fortune, mimics the television show with a high-resolution 3D set that pans and zooms across the stage, from contestant podium to game board. Alex Trebek roots players on through FMV clips, and each of the game's 3,500 questions (er, answers...) is read out by the show's announcer, Johnny Gilbert. Players can even scribble their name on their podium, a Jeopardy trademark that's a welcome addition to the PlayStation rendition. And if there's a memory card inserted in the PlayStation, the game remembers which categories already have been revealed to eliminate repetition.   The only problem with Jeopardy is the audience. Don't think for a second just because you graduated high school you can answer these questions  most of them are hard. But if you can put up with looking like an idiot for a few rounds, you'll have a ball matching wits in Jeopardy.  If you ever drop by my apartment on a random day, you'll probably find the Game Show Network turned on my cable box. I love game shows simply for the camp factor, but the one show I just can't watch is Jeopardy. I'm sorry, I don't know the average rainfall in the Amazon forest, the entire fourth act of Hamlet, or the name of Melville's mistress when he was writing Moby Dick. Jeopardy on the PlayStation is an excellent conversion of the TV show, down to the super-smooth 3D virtual studio. There are a ton of questions  but the same reason why I won't watch Jeopardy is the same reason why I won't play this game: I just don't know the answers to half the questions. I'll sit there like an idiot scratching my head for most of the game. However, it's quite the adrenaline rush when you can actually clean out a category.Jeopardy isn't my cup o' tea, but there's a lot of fans of the game show that will appreciate what Hasbro's done for the PlayStation.", "date": "Dec 10, 1998"}
