{"name": "Ed, Edd 'n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures", "name_review": "Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/30/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-mis-edventures-3", "text": "If you've seen the show on Cartoon Network, then you're probably familiar with Ed, Edd and Eddy. Basically, they're idiots obsessed with finding jawbreakers. In this respect, the game based on the show is no different. You'll spend your time controlling the trio in a hub world, called the Cul-de-Sac, from where you'll access the game's few levels. Each level is preceded by animation sequences that details the limited story. For fans of the series or parents looking for a good game for their kids, this is a title to consider. It stays true to the squiggly-lined visual style of the show, has at times funny voice work, and maintains to some degree the scatterbrained sense of humor that made the show popular.   There's no real overarching plot to this game, it's basically just a series of episodic levels, called scams. There are six total scams, including two bonus levels which are unlocked if you're able to find hidden pieces of clothing. None of the levels are particularly challenging, but a lot of your objectives are, unfortunately, unclear to a confusing degree. Aside from those few moments that will have even veteran gamers scratching their heads, the game does have some decent gameplay elements a kid could really enjoy.   A prime example of something nobody should ever do. The game allows you to switch between Ed, Edd and Eddy on the fly, and they all have special abilities. Eddy, the leader, can throw stink bombs, sling his yo-yo, and form a tower consisting of him and his three teammates to reach high objects. Ed, the idiot tall one, can slam his head into the ground, dig in sandboxes, throw heavy objects, and form a battering ram with the other Eds. Edd, the smart one with the hat, can manipulate objects and switches in the environment, fire his slingshot, and get hoisted up by his teammates to reach higher ledges. As you progress through this extremely short game, you'll find that each level requires you to use each skill quite frequently.   Though the beginning levels give you a short of tutorial about where to use each skill, you'll quickly find yourself on your own. Afterwards, the challenge of the game is figuring out exactly which skill to use in which situation. So, in the haunted house level, it may take you a while to figure out how to get a can of grease to drop out of a picture frame. After what seems like a countless amount of time, you may eventually find that you needed to use Eddy's tower ability to grab an urn off a cabinet and put it on a shelf. Similarly, in one of the later levels you'll need to traverse a muddy bog. Using Edd's slingshot you'll knock down planks to help you get safely across. However, there will be one point where you'll continue to fall into the water, and you'll have to almost accidentally figure out that you needed to boost Edd up to a trailer roof and use his board to knock down a tire onto a tarp to help you get across.   This game just couldn't exist without Plank. Aside from these annoying points, the game has a decent amount of variety despite its brief length. You'll play sequences where you'll need to beat a timer, race opponents, or even stealth past town residents. These stealth sequences are suspiciously similar to Metal Gear Solid, requiring you to hide under boxes and putting question marks over the head of those you're trying to evade when they notice you. Nonetheless, it adds a nice variety to the gameplay, though not much depth.     Still, this is a children's game, and as such, it works pretty well. There are tons of collectibles to gather, including jawbreakers, chicken eggs that unlocks special game modes like Big Heads, and the costumes that unlock hidden levels. One of the hidden levels, Edzilla, was actually a lot of fun despite its simplicity. It gives you control of Ed as a fictional monster, and he needs to destroy all the buildings in a city while taking out tank manufacturing plants.   Graphically, the game captures the style of the TV show to an accurate degree with well animated, cel-shaded character models and cartoony backgrounds. Unfortunately there isn't a huge enemy variety, mostly rats, spiders, and squirrels. Too many of the environments look almost exactly the same, save for a few levels, and there is strange graphical flickering in some places. Also, you'll notice loading issues. There's no transition between indoor and outdoor environments. One second you're approaching a door, the next you're outside, which is disorienting for sure. The game unfortunately suffers from imprecise collision detection which strips away any strategy to the combat. To kill enemies, the best strategy is just to charge forward while slamming the attack button.   They're dumb. Though there's little to be heard, the sound is pretty good. Each level's music track is a subdued saxophone arrangement which fits with the shows main, whistling theme. The character voices can be hilarious at times, especially Ed's proclamation that he's just like a woodpecker, except with dirt, or his ~Dig a hole, dig a hole,~ expression when he's clawing sand. The problem is each character only has around two or three things they'll say as you go through levels. You're definitely going to get sick of Double D calling out, ~My, my, intriguing!~ every time he manipulates a mechanical device. Given how there's voice work throughout each cut scene, it would have been a welcome addition to include more of it in the regular gameplay.   In terms of characters, you'll find most of the regulars here, including the Kankers as your main opposition. You'll also run into Jimmy, Jonny and Plank, Rolf, and Sarah, who all also take part in the animated cut-scenes. They mostly function to give you quests within the game's levels. Unfortunately, many of these quests are annoying, especially the timed basketball tossing quest, which you might actually break your controller trying to complete. It wouldn't be an issue if the camera wasn't so slow to respond. Also, your character's walking speed takes a while to get to full bore, and under a timer this turns into a problem.For little kids or for big fans of the show this could be a solid buy, especially since the visuals reproduce the visual style of the show quite accurately. There are problems, however. The game is extremely short, the gameplay doesn't offer an impressive amount of depth, the puzzles can be overly confusing at times, and the character voices can get annoyingly repetitive. Also, there's awkward level loading, inaccurate hit detection, and some strange glitch instances where, for instance, you'll fall in the water when you're standing on a bridge. If you can overlook all of that and you're interested in this game strictly because it contains Ed, Edd, and Eddy, then you might have fun. Otherwise, stay away.", "date": "Nov 30, 2005"}
