That's quite a feat for Hudson, considering the series took an abrupt nosedive into mediocrity on the latest Wii version. The DS is the perfect platform for this series in a lot of ways; the various input methods allow for a pretty impressive variety of games across the 70-plus available. But there are a number of issues that hold this game back from party perfection.   This time around, if you partake in the story mode, you'll be taking on minigames that really are 'mini'. Mario and his band of merry men, women, dinosaurs and so on have been shrunk, Rick Moranis style. Now they need to track down Bowser and set things right, securing a sacred Star Shard and defeating a few bosses  in the process. This is the core of the single-player experience this time around, but hardly the sole single-player feature. The game really caters to people who prefer to play alone, offering five modes, including Story Mode, Party Mode, Minigame Mode, Puzzle mode and a Gallery.    The story mode is actually a bit of a let-down, thanks in part to a stupid format for single-player progression. Although things begin like a traditional Mario Party game, the inclusion of boss battles with giant-sized Mario universe characters actually weakens the experience. The game actually forces you to play through ten turns as standard, unless you come first overall, you can't face off against the boss and thus, you can't progress. On the surface, that's cool. You need to hone your minigame skills to play on, which is fine and logical.     However, one of the Mario Party DS' most significant faults lies in how the game can snatch victory away from you on the ninth or tenth turn entirely thanks to chance. That's a real problem since games are decided a lot of the time on two or three stars total that you've collected. To lose just one star thanks to a crappy minigame that gives you a 50/50 shot at winning is grossly unfair and a cheap way of lengthening the game's longevity. And it happens more often than is fair, because of an upped emphasis on randomisers and play modifiers like Bowser's rounds and similar.   Party games live or die by the quality of the games on offer, and by most accounts, Mario Party DS throws so many at you that the duds are overshadowed by the number of mostly pretty fun ones. This time around, you'll be surfing on bars of soap, trying to stay afloat on rubber ducks, shooting pellets while running on a world globe, dancing under a spotlight, digging for your life, fishing, tracing, platforming and a host of other activities. A few also make use of the microphone, but Nintendo wisely include the option to stick to non-mic games if you're feeling a little conspicuous.   The AI does run into a few issues - mainly in terms of cooperative activities requiring two or three players to perform a task - say, steer a car together or rotate and shimmy up a drainpipe. The AI seems to react painfully slowly to your decisions, performing actions with a robotic rhythm that is in line with what the other AI characters are doing but probably pretty far behind the speed and accuracy of a human player. The lack of communication makes coordinating during these kinds of games a major hassle. That's the nature of the beast we suppose, but bear it in mind - you'll want to play with a couple of human mates for the best experience.   In the multiplayer department, things are mixed. On one hand, having one-card / four player games is excellent. We really appreciate being able to have a couple of friends around for a bash, or have a two-player game on one of the included puzzle games specifically tailored to two players. On the other, we have this nifty DS headset that just doesn't get used anymore; Wi-Fi multiplayer is missing and that just breaks our heart.   The lack of boards is frustrating, but there are plenty of side attractions and distractions.  We're guessing that the temptation to disconnect at the end of nine or ten rounds might be too great to invest the time for players who might actually play properly. However, we'd have preferred to have the option to play online as opposed to not have it at all.   There are so many modes, games and unlockables that Mario Party DS feels like a fully-featured game rather than a sequelised culmination of the past eight or nine entries (if you count the GBA version). In addition to the five boards and minigames galore, there are also a handful of different block and bubble-based games to distract you. These play like versions of Puzzle Bobble, Dr. Mario and Kirby's Avalanche from the SNES. The gallery mode displays all kinds of unlockables - character models, items and badges of achievement from your impressive Mario Party performances.   The graphics engine actually does some cool things with simulated water effects and the scale of the game world; once again, Hudson mostly handles the Mario licence pretty well. Character models are fairly low polygon, but that's to be expected. This is more than made up for in some of the games that see you flying across an impressively detailed backyard on a coat-hanger zipline or many of the better minigames.   However, the incessant random games - having to pick cards, guess which fish is on which rope and even having to second-guess the AI in a chase - will frustrate. The game punishes you in this way, and it lets down the structure of the game. With mates at the helm, you'll feel better about losing it at the line, but losing to AI because of chance is just plain lousy. Plus, when the games are bad, they're bad. There are games that you will flat-out groan about playing because they're either tedious and slow, ill-conceived or improbably slanted in certain players' favours.   Ultimately, there is a lot here for a DS game - and so there should be. This is a series that has probably reached saturation point (although it sells by the truckload, so it ain't going anywhere) but there's probably enough new content and direction to make this a worthwhile party outing for gamers who are new to the series. Just be mindful of the numerous rough edges.", "date": "Nov 23, 2007"}
