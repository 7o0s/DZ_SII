Featuring a full 18 fighters (including the hidden ones), the game takes a look at what might result if mummies, vampires, and other creatures of the night came to fisticuffs. Just as in its coin-op form, Darkstalkers 3 features two speed settings, and the option to enable auto-blocking. Capcom has expanded on the idea of the traditional super attack with the Dark Force, a move that ~transports~ both players to an ethereal plane where the initiating fighter can unleash some unusually powerful (and often odd-looking) attacks. Furthermore, for the home version Capcom has beefed up the fighting system with the addition of powerful EX attacks, which are enhancements of the stock special moves.  Also in its efforts to prepare the game for home, Capcom has included a versus mode, training mode, and an intriguing Original Mode that enables players to customize the name and color of their character and fight them against either CPU or human opponents to increase their attributes. These characters can then be saved to memory card.  Just as in the recently-released Street Fighter Collection 2, Darkstalkers 3 boasts support for the vibration effect of Dual Shock (and compatible) controllers, but, despite what the packaging says, doesn't support their analog thumbpads.When the original Darkstalkers first hit arcades, I frankly could have cared less. I was big on the Street Fighter II series at the time, and it really didn't make much (if any) of an impact on me. That changed with the release of Darkstalkers 3.Having has my fill of the various SF2's for the time being, I began playing the game while in Japan. That occasional play soon turned into regular play, which resulted in my current respect for this truly solid fighting game. Now it's out on PlayStation, and while it's not 100% like its coin-operated sibling in every way, it's still just as good.Darkstalkers 3 is different, and that's probably why I like it so much. It's fast, but not too fast. It's got a wide variety of moves, but it's not that hard to pick up. It's also lots of fun while remaining surprisingly balanced. Plus it has some of the best designed characters to come out of Capcom.I know what you're all thinking: ~Does it look like the arcade game?~ Not exactly, but I'll say that it is one of Capcom's best arcade-to-PlayStation conversions to date. It's surprisingly smooth and animated given the system's memory constraints. And after thorough play, any thought of missing frames of animation left my mind entirely. Quite frankly, I was too focused on how good the game was to care.Overall, Darkstalkers 3 is an exceptional effort from Capcom on a gameplay and technical front. It's not the absolute best 2D fighter on PlayStation, but it's one of the best. I'm really surprised by how good a conversion it is, and can easily recommend it to fans of the genre, especially those who loved the arcade game.", "date": "Nov 25, 1998"}
