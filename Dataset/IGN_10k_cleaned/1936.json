But it is also accurate to say that the GBC saved the best for last. That is, there are no two games better than Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons currently available on the system. And there never will be. Not only do the games capture everything that makes Zelda great, they are just right in terms of difficulty, game length and compatibility. In short, the Oracle games are the pinnacle of what can be created for this type of system. We can only hope that games as good as this find their way to the Advance. Individually, each of these titles would be the ultimate, but the fact that they both ship on the same day is unbelievable.Features Quest that lasts dozens of hours Battery back-up Interacts with Oracle of Seasons Only for Game Boy ColorOracle of Ages is a bit more complex and involved than its Seasons counterpart. The story is similar, even though it takes place in the mystical land of Labrynna. The evil sorceress Veran has possessed the body of Nayru, the peaceful Oracle of Ages, who controls the flow of time. Using the Oracle, Veran goes back to the past to build a tower that will block out the sun and allow evil to spread across the land. It's Link's job to restore order by tripping through the tunnels of time with the help of a magic Harp. The way the Harp changes the world is amazing. As time shifts back and forth from Present to Past, the map changes with it. As you master new Harp tunes, you'll be able to shift the flow of time back and forth so that you can access new parts of the map. This is a slick gameplay feature that really enhances the quest. As with every Zelda adventure, you'll see puzzles and objects early in the game that are inaccessible. But as you collect Items and Tunes, you'll eventually access every area in the land.In addition to the Harp, the special Items Link collects in Ages are innovative and fun. Some, like the Switch Hook, Roc's Feather and the Bracelet, you'll remember from Link's Awakening. Others, like the Mermaid Suit and Cane of Somaria are new to Ages. Each of the Items you receive helps you immediately. The game makes good use of almost every Item it introduces. Boss fights often hinge on whatever Item you picked up in the Dungeon. And as you progress through subsequent levels, Items don't get forgotten. You'll need them all the carry you through to the end.Mystical Seeds are new to the Zelda universe, and they are a dandy addition. These magical seeds can be found on Mystical Trees scattered throughout the realm and used in two different ways: straight out of Satchel or shot from the Seed Shooter. There are five kinds in total, and using them correctly will be one of the keys to surviving the adventure.All of your old animal friends have made their way back to the game: Moosh the blue bear, Ricky the kangaroo, and Dmitri the sea lizard each contribute to your adventure. In addition, the Zora, Tokay and Goron races are represented, as well as all of the old enemies. Octoroks, Leevers, Tektites, Moblins--all of the creatures that graced the original NES version of the game--are also here, as well as a few new faces. Generally, the monsters you'll meet in Labrynna are fairly wimpy, with the exception of a few sword-toting Soldiers, which can be tough to take down.As with all other Zelda games, you progress through a series of adventures that take you to eight Dungeons that are scattered throughout the land. In each Dungeon, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles in order to work your way through the maze, collecting Keys, Items and Rupees along the way. The puzzles were (for the most part) fresh and fun. Of course, there are the usual stumpers here as well. But if you're like me, you love the challenge. What's the fun of beating an easy game?At the midway point of each Dungeon, you'll battle a Mini-Boss. While some of these fights are quite simple, others require ingenious schemes and considerable skill. For instance, to fight the mole Subterror, you have to pop him out of the ground with a Shovel, then finish him off with your Sword. It is the same with the Boss fights. They are set at just the right level of difficulty. You'll likely fight a Boss a couple times before learning the secret to beating him. For instance, late in the game there is a Boss made of iron. It took me about four turns before I figured out I had to use my sword to bat his hands back into his face. I like this kind of learning curve. Not only does it extend gameplay, but makes me feel I've earned something by getting to the next level.The pace at which the quest unfolds is perfect. Just as you're getting mega-frustrated with a puzzle, you'll figure it out. Just when you think you've been everywhere, a new area will open up. It's a masterpiece of game design. The story elements are pretty standard for a Zelda game, but this is more nostalgic than bothersome. Besides, there's only so much you can do with story on this kind of format.In addition to the main quest, there are a couple of extra things to do. There is a sort of side quest that revolves around trading items with the various colorful characters scattered throughout Labrynna. This makes use of almost every character in the game, and results in getting an upgrade to your Wooden Sword.The other thing you can do is collect all of the Rings in the game. This is quite challenging, as several of the Rings are quite rare. You'll find them in chests and hidden caves and receive some through character events. But to get the most rare, you will have to master the art of planting Gasha Seeds. This can be done only on specific patches of soft soil located throughout the land. Plant a seed, leave it for awhile, then come back to find a fully-grown Gasha Nut. When you pluck the Nut, you'll find a new Ring (or power-up) inside. The more remote or odd the planting location, the rarer the Ring you receive. This quest for Rings adds a collection element to the game and makes for even more gameplay. The fact that you can swap Rings using the link cable adds a Pokemon feel to the game, which isn't bad.The thing that makes these games unique and extra fun to play is the linking feature. There are a couple of ways to do it, but each revolves around beating the game several times. When you conquer Ages, you will be given a password to start Seasons with. If you begin the second game with this code, some special features will be unlocked. First off, there will be more encounters with NPCs (non-player characters). Some of these will lead to Passwords, which can only be used after you complete this game, then replay Ages. These passwords will send you on short errands to retrieve secrets, that in turn give you valuable weapon and item power-ups.The linking also leads to three extra boss battles at the end of the game. Here, you'll get a chance to take on the witches Twinrova and the main baddie Ganon. It will also give you the opportunity to see Princess Zelda in a scene that does not exist in the non-linked game.As far as graphics go, they are above-average for the Gameboy. The colors are vibrant, the characters are quirky and as detailed as possible for the GBC. The environments are nice and big and the maps are well-done. Bottom line: it's as pretty as anything on the system. The sound is not mega-impressive, but what GBC sound is? The melody that accompanies gameplay starts out being whimsical and fun, but wears you down by the twentieth hour of gameplay. Still, the sound is better than a lot of the tinny fare that normally emits from the Game Boy speaker.As long as it takes to complete this game (over 30 hours to get everything), every moment is fun and engaging. The quest is beautifully crafted, the level and Dungeon design is top-notch and the graphics are beautiful. This is a great swan song for an excellent system. The must-est of the must buys!", "date": "May 14, 2001"}
