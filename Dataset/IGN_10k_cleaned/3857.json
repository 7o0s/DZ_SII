And while I still liked it, and it's still quite different than any other movie that has ever been released in concept and art style, it definitely wasn't as exciting as I remember it. Maybe my childish fascination with the art and the fun I remember having throwing dishes around skewed my memory a bit... I don't know. Unfortunately TRON 2.0 is sitting much the same way with me. I'm looking at it fondly because I enjoyed the story, presentation, and beautiful artwork, but the game itself wasn't exactly the most exciting gameplay experience I've ever had on the PC.   The Story   Disney brought out TRON two decades ago. It was an interesting concept with even more interesting art. Now, twenty years later, Disney and Monolith have opened up the world hiding inside of computers yet again, only this time with an updated story and upgraded computer world. But the story doesn't veer too far away from the original; blending elements together in one of the best-presented games I've seen in a while. The story is interesting and engaging with characters and dialogue that tows the line between humans and computerese just as the original did.   The story follows Alan Bradley (the creator of the TRON program and the digitizing process from the movie) and more importantly, his son Jet, whom players get to control. After his father is forcedly removed from his offices, Jet is suddenly drawn out of his computer games programming world and sucked into the computer, just as Flynn was 20 years ago. What follows is a funny mix of dangerous computer virus problems, jumping around over the network to various systems, and tackling a nefarious plot involving an attack on all information and the Internet as we know it.

Get The Guide | See Other Guides   It's written fairly well with plenty of help from the voice actors, who did a good job (even Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) helping to let me step into the world and suspend disbelief. These dialogue parts are used either in cut-scenes (all in-game engine) and sometimes while playing the game to get more objectives. The cutscenes are generally done well with some interesting angles and good animation.     Along with the spoken parts, the story is also brought along cleverly using emails found throughout the different systems that are visited throughout the game. I have to admit I thought it a bit strange to find some of the emails where I found them, but for the most part, they all fit accordingly to who owns that particular piece of hardware. For instance, you'll find emails to and from Thorne when you're in his corrupted server, while you'll find mail to and from Alan Bradley when on his server. All of it ties the story together well in a fun way.   The Presentation   Thinks like finding emails are found everywhere in the game, summing up an incredible amount of presentation value. You'll see logs and notices running across your screen from time to time in a simple script form giving a small amount of information like when security has found you, when some new script is running, and so on. Everything in the world is some form of computer ~something~. Enemies come in the form of Resource Hogs, ICP Programs, the Kernel, Corrupted Programs, Bits, Bytes... you get the picture. All of these guys speak (almost all of the programs you meet speak some lines of dialogue) in computerese, calling each other ~program~ and ~script~ like they did in the movie, referring often to alpha and beta versions of programs, and how they think it's sad when programs have to be reinstalled after a reformat. I guess none of the jargon is going to impress any super techies, but it adds that extra oomph to the idea the game takes place in a computer.   The interface deserves a bit of notice. Almost your entire screen is free for you to see. Only the very edges and corner have any GUI giving you full range to see the beauty that is TRON 2.0. One of the most interesting and nifty additions to the game is the memory slot interface for using subroutines, which I'll get into more detail about in the gameplay section. Basically subroutines take up memory slots. Each different server that you visit has different amounts of available memory in different configurations. It's just another small touch, and one that adds to gameplay issues as well.    The Graphics   TRON 2.0 makes my eyes feel like they need to smoke a cigarette. It's plain sexy in there and the art guys should all have their legs humped or something in congratulations. The world is presented as something nearly simple because of the color schemes, yet there's so much moving around, so many transparent textures, and so many little blips and flashes that you realize how much detail there really is in this world. Things are smooth, things are crisp, and things are glowing all over the damn place. Different levels have very different feels from one another. Some servers, such as the fCon server, use only purple colors while others bust out with nearly all complementary colors in an explosion of visual contrast. Every single one of these levels has a different color scheme to differentiate the levels as well as some other touches. For instance, the corrupted server level, while using the corrupted green color scheme, also has a pea soup fog covering the landscape making the whole area actually look sick with the virus.   Character models are also very well done. I specifically like the ICP models and how they're pretty much empty in the middle and shielded on the outside. And when that body armor drops down, you know you better get yourself ready. Most of the other programs are modeled just as well with crisp textures and different animation sequences. The corrupted programs in particular were a treat to watch. They shuffle and hunch and just plain look corrupted. One of the first cutscenes in the game shows a program being converted and has probably one of the most precious pieces of animation in the game as he stoops down and begins to undulate a bit.   The effects, for weapons and otherwise, are pretty well done, although I wasn't quite as impressed on that end as I was with the rest of the game's look. It's pretty neat how enemy programs collapse in a pile of pixels when derezzed or explode into fragments when you really give them a walloping, but the output didn't impress me as much as the rest of the game. The weapons themselves on the other hand were modeled and textured brilliantly. The rod weapons (more in a sec) were beautiful in particular and the transitions between weapons were animated so well... you really have to see it to understand. The weapons actually come together in your hands, aside from your disk that is, which always sits on your arm.     The Gameplay   Now if looks and presentation were all games were about, they'd be movies. And while the gameplay in TRON 2.0 isn't bad, most of the game isn't especially exciting. Add in some gameplay devices that I've really grown to hate in FPSs and you've got me annoyed and wanting to stop playing every now and again.   It's kind of hard for me to really explain why I didn't particularly find the core gameplay of TRON 2.0 as appealing as I thought I was going to originally. Maybe having only played the beginning levels I had thought the action would speed up significantly in the final levels. But it just didn't happen. And while I love the fact that I'm running around slapping people in the face with my disc, that combat itself wasn't quite as interesting as I thought it would be either. Maybe this all boils down to taste, as movie reviews usually go. The combat wasn't broken, levels were mostly interesting, and it wasn't always easy, but there was just something missing from the equation that kept me from having as much fun with the gameplay as I had looking around the environments.   Was it the weapons? That may have something to do with it. While I had a good amount of weapons types in the game (12 in all), there didn't seem to be much reason to use most of the weapons other than your disc, and using your disc all the time can cramp your hand up. Not only were there not very many points that specifically called for the use of many of the other weapons, they just weren't as powerful as the level 3 disc for a few reasons. That disc doesn't cost a whole lot of energy, it does a ton of damage, you can still block with it, and you can guide it around.    Every now and again, before the level 3 disc was gained, other weapons would come in handy. The shotgun-like Suffusion gun was good for some of the more powerful enemies and there were a couple of spaces that things were much easier or necessary with the LOL sniper rifle. But I hardly ever used the ball weapon (pretty much like a snot grenade), or the mesh weapons that some of the later enemies use.    A couple of the weapons were stealthy close range weapons, but I never seemed to be able to completely sneak up on anything. Not only would they notice me (even with the gold version subroutine to make my footsteps quiet), but so would all of their friends and then I'd be stuck holding a weapon that is not good in a crowded fire fight.   So was it the levels? I actually liked the design of some of the levels. There was definitely creativity spent on them. I don't know, maybe I my expectations were too high from No One Lives Forever, but with such a fantasy world like this, where nearly anything is possible, I expected more outlandish level and gameplay designs.   All of this isn't to say there weren't some good moments, there were. Escaping reformats, getting swamped by corrupted programs on the Internet, and fighting alongside some security programs were all good moments. But they were too few and too far in between, and didn't get taken quite as far as they might have. Some of these sequences also suffered from very abrupt ends thanks to timed cutscenes that burst in at certain points. Seeing different programs fight each other was fun, but it didn't have a frantic mood that have marked classics scenes like in Medal of Honor and Halo when fighting with friendly troops.   Now, aside from wishing there was a bit more excitement, there were some gameplay issues that just plain bugged me. First, falling from about 10 feet onto a lower platform wouldn't kill a man, I'm sure. Maybe rules are different in the computer, but those rules are annoying as hell. So are jumping puzzles. I thought we were over these. I hate jumping puzzles. I can find very little to enjoy about jumping puzzles, even if falling doesn't mean death. Jumping puzzles make me want to hurt things. There is a lot of jumping in TRON 2.0. Granted, you get some license for where you land, and it isn't Half-Life hard, but what's the point of them? They aren't fun or exciting and generally slow the gameplay down. Are there people out there that like these things? Let me know if you do and I'll help you find some psychiatric care.     I also hate it when enemies suddenly appear behind me without warning and hurt me because there's also someone that appeared in front of me and I'm paying attention to him. This happened several times throughout the game. All of them annoyed me. Some of them killed me. I never knew any of them were coming. I don't like running through a linear game having to turn around and check my back every two seconds.   Aside from that, there were some little problems that annoyed me, such as the propensity to be facing a character when talking to them and have them tell you to how to use a weapon and then accidentally killing them when you give it a shot. Oops. Or the time I went running into an area to proceed to the next level and ran off of the edge and died because it didn't load up the new zone. All right, maybe I should have stopped running there, but you get the point. Aside from that, there were only a couple of other bugs, but no crashes.   Light Cycles   Not only are these found in the single player story game at times, but they've also been given their own racing circuit and a birth in multiplayer (which I get into in the next section). Light Cycles are a great idea that work just like the old ones, only in splendid 3D. The problem is, when playing in single player, the computer has a hell of an advantage. Quick sharp turns are easy for them and not so easy for my thick stupid fingers and slow reflexes. I can't turn that fast, there's no way. And I have a feeling that will be the case for many players out there.   If you take that little bit away, Light Cycles can be pretty fun for a while. The Light Cycle circuit mode is where you'll get the most practice. You play through several different maps, each with obstacles, traps, and plenty of power-ups.    The courses you play vary in size, which unfortunately means some of them can be too damn big. There were times that I was wandering around in circles looking for enemies and not finding them. That's not the fast paced fun I hoped for with Light Cycles. On the other hand, it can be insane in a small area where those computers have the reflex advantage. Medium sized maps are a good blend and offer a good bit of fun. You'll have to beat a few heats of racers in each map to pass the level though, with only a certain amount of lives, and a map that adds obstacles and racers. It's fun mixed with frustration that's easy to jump into for small play periods when you have a few minutes to kill.   Multiplayer   I like the multiplayer. Not enough to play it all the time. But I think it's fun to jump into and fool around for a while. The problem is, there's just not enough interest for me to spend a lot of time perfecting my skills. There are three modes to play in, two of which are all about the Disc Arena and one for the Light Cycles.   The Disc Arena is the one that will be played the most, simply because it's really the only one that's viable over the Internet. These games are divided up into 5 different map zones, with four actual arenas a piece. Players can run around in between arenas killing each other while they wait for an open spot, or can sit at the windows (or in one case on the transparent roof) and watch the matches happen in real time, which will probably be the choice in games with teams.   Each of the maps is taken from one of the zones in the single player game along with the color scheme and each also has different modes of play. The one folks are used to in the demo are the rings, which look like traditional Discs of TRON style play. Others will have blocks that appear and disappear, targets that can be hit which will remove all of the platforms of a certain color from play, and some just have plain oddly shaped playing fields that are vertical as well as horizontal.     I've had fun playing around in the arenas, but like I said, it's just not going to be enough to keep me hooked for a long time.    The Light Cycles require way too much ping consistency to be really worth it. Even on a LAN, which is really the only supported way to play Light Cycles, there're some issues where you'll crash and you won't even know what happened. However, when you do get a low ping and synched up game going, it can be pretty fun. Testing reflex and strategy out is a kick, but because the games tend to be so quick and painless, they're also not going to keep people really hooked for a long time. This is only compounded by the factor that folks are going to have to play at LAN shops or spend a lot of time getting their friends together for a LAN party to play. And I doubt anyone is really going consider it worth the trouble, regardless of how fun it can be for an hour or so.  So I said some good things and some bad things and some so-so things. What's the verdict? I still feel positive about this game. I'm not glowing as much as that nifty graphic feature does, but I loved being able to visit this vision, which is what I was really excited about to begin with.There were enough good things about the game to outweigh the things I didn't like so much. If only there had been a faster pace, less jumping, and more scripted events that brought in more neutral and friendly bodies to help you or just interfere, that would have been great.TRON 2.0 plays almost more like an interactive movie than an action game at some points, but I don't consider that necessarily a bad thing in this case. There's just enough action to give you things to do, but I never really felt that fear of being hunted or in the middle of some large struggle aside from a couple of occasions.If you're a fan of the TRON movie, you won't be disappointed with this game, it has a lot you'll enjoy. If you're an action fan looking for non-stop fighting and huge explosions, you might want to check out the demo first to make sure you know what you're getting into.", "date": "Aug 22, 2003"}
