I'm dying for the Game Boy Advance to come alive with good action games. Turok: Evolution gave a good run, as have a Levi's jeans fifth-pocketful of other gunning and slashing games, but when I first saw the GBA, I knew it was a machine born to bring heat. Yet after years of being under-powered by the pea-shooter Game Boy Pocket and GBC, it's looking more and more as if game designers have lost the know-how in handling heavy firepower action games. BAM's Kong: The Animated Series is a good example -- it's all there for a rip-roaring action-adventure game, but then the boom never pops.  Features  Play as the mighty ape Kong or the agile human Jason Explore 7 worlds, from Kong Island to NYC Only for Game Boy Advance   I'm not sure I can blame developers Planet Interactive much for letting this one fall flat -- the TV show that Kong: The Animated Series based on was a terrible animated mess with a good concept (son of Kong is genetically reborn) that gets monkey-pooped on (son of Kong spends most of his day stopping silly men from stealing magic rocks.) After a harrowing encounter with the original Kong which affected her life so deeply that she decided to become the world's foremost genetic scientist (yes, it's a big change, but Kong is a BIG ape), Dr. Lorna Jenkins has recreated Kong from his original DNA. For some odd reason, the mad doc had to improvise a bit with Kong Jr.'s DNA (apparently, she couldn't get a big enough test sample from the carcass of an 8-story gorilla), but by fusing the genes of Kong with her grandson Jason, she's able to create a super-Kong capable of human understanding! Plus, she's breeded a good buddy for her plucky granson to boot! Anyway, bad guys take Kong Island's mystical gems, the local animals start acting wild (when feral creatures become uncivilized in an uninhabited land, that's apparently still a bad thing,) and monkey-boy and his jungle jim little pal go swinging into action.  As silly and stupid as the show is/was, Planet Interactive could have still done good things with what they had. You can see from the screenshots that they at least started to try -- I'm not sure if it was apathy for a lame license or just lack of action game-design chops that led them to fail. The beautiful backgrounds and parallax scrolling is good eye candy, and despite the gargantuan Kong appearing only a bit taller than the game's humans, the hero sprite are drawn sharp.  But then, something went really wrong. It starts with the animation -- I haven't unintentionally laughed so hard at a game in ages. Jason, the game's manly hero, swings his bow staff with a little girl's underhand jab -- he can find a power-up that lets him throw a fey overhand swing, and even then, the kid looks like he's afraid the things will fly out of his hands and poke somebody in the eye. This is a problem. The bear enemies look and move like guys in a fur suit, and when you hit a dinosaur, he flies back with arms akimbo like he's in ~The Jazz Singer~. The way that enemies can be juggled is corny as all get-out -- especially when the lions curl into little balls and roll around as if they suddenly became armadillos. This isn't the fault of the show's bad animation style -- somebody at Planet Interactive was off their rocker when they designed a few of these sprites.  The game control also has plenty of quirks that just killed the experience for me -- little things that the designers need to get right if they want to start earning the 8's and 9's on tiny games like this that will give them a good rep. There's the small but irritating problems, like the way that the jumping animation doesn't transition into the running animation (thus losing all of your momentum when you jump, making jumping a lot less fun when you just want to hop about) and the way that enemies take WAY too long to die and give up their trinkets (I half-expected the little Oscar audience to pop in and applaud the dramatic death scene like in ~The Mask.~) Then there's the large and frustrating flaws, like the way ducking attacks still can go over the heads of small animals as they attack your defenseless mega-ape, or the way that the combined man-and-ape still just looks like the ape (and is actually less useful in battle), and the constant respawning of enemies in the vaguely laid-out levels (good luck exploring these stages, kids -- I'd draw you a map, but you'd still never know where the heck you were.)   The thing is, there's elements in this dumb, senseless game that can be fun to play. The basic principle of jumping around and hitting baddies is fun. Action games are fun. Gimme action games!!!I'm getting ahead of myself with my hunger for action gaming, but the point is that if Kong: The Animated Series was better in just a few areas, it'd have been worth your while. Not that it'd be great, but some small fixes would have been a 7, and 7.0 games are great to have in your GBA bag. But the levels go nowhere, the combat isn't fun enough to keep you going, and the irritating quirks are jerks. I don't think Fay Wray's crying that this one fell down.", "date": "Sep 13, 2002"}
