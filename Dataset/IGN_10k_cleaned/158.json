Sony's next addition to the Parappa universe, Um Jammer Lammy, only compliments these 'Simon-says' style of games. And although this game's tracks and story weren't as catchy as the first Parappa title, Um Jammer Lammy still delivers a complete package with its great song variety and extra features. Gameplay For those unfamiliar with the story, Um Jammer Lammy is staged in the same Parappa world and puts you behind the 2D personality of Lammy, a young female guitar gal trying to get to her next band gig and ultimately build her self-esteem through music. But if you're expecting a cool story, well, you might be unpleasantly surprised. If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. I might be nitpicking just a tad, but hey, the story just lacked and it had to be mentioned. But the rest of the game is sweet.  Now up above, I said the songs weren't as addicting as the first Parappa's, and in my opinion, they're not. This doesn't mean that they're not good. That's one thing I enjoyed about Um Jammer Lammy was its variety of tracks. They all sound different and had their own distinct beat. No one song sounded the same and that's what kept Um Jammer Lammy a fun title, is its mixture and complexity in its beats. Man, some of the tracks featured are really hard to beat. I'll be honest, I had to switch the game to 'easy' just so I could figure out how some of the songs grooved. Oh man, you just wait until you play Teriyaki Yoko, jeesh, that was a tough one. Oops, I know that this should be in the sound, but hey, the music is part of the game!  Um Jammer Lammy also has a lot of great extras that Parappa didn't come with. For starters, the Cooperative and Competitive modes are awesome. I won't lie, Doug and I could not stop battling each other in Competitive mode -- that was a lot of fun and this feature alone brings the replay value up, big time.  In addition to the two-player modes, Um Jammer Lammy also has Parappa remixes. That's right, kids. If you beat the game with Lammy on normal you can go into the stage select menu and there will be a candy bar and you'll be able to play as Parappa. All the tracks have been remixed with raps from Parappa himself. This also adds a ton of added value to the title as well. Graphics The graphics in this game are amazing. If you've played the first Parappa game then you know what I'm talking about. But for those that haven't, here's the run down. Lammy's universe is 2D and animated. To put it in perspective, it's like taking control of a Saturday morning cartoon -- it's so wacky looking.   The level and character design in this game is super-unique. Sure, it shares some similarities with Parappa, but still, the characters, and their environments, go hand in hand with each other, and after awhile, really do separate itself from its Parappa predecessor. For example, Cathy Piller's stage takes place in a nursery. Oh man, it's a total trip. There's like, all these little pastel-colored caterpillars running and whining around. It's weird, but looks like nothing you would see in Parappa. The game flows the same, but it still feels like a totally different game. Granted, there are some reappearing cast members, like the two bullies and Chop Chop Master Onion. But still, when I think about it, after you get passed the first two songs, you're not even reminded of Parappa, you're thinking about getting to the next level, to see what kind of wackyness you'll embark upon next.  At any rate, Um Jammer Lammy's look is really cool. The levels, the FMVs, all of them are uniquely designed and fit the game nicely. It's an LSDer's dream, quite frankly. Sound I tried to save the game's soundtrack to the end, because this is where the game totally separates itself from Parappa. Um Jammer Lammy's music tracks are incredible. Sure, the idea of lyrics being replaced by guitar riffs didn't sound too appealing at first. But the songs take a break from Parappa's hip-hop influence and dip its notes into other genres of music (Rock-a-billy, grudge, speed metal, etc.). For example, Captain Fussenpepper's stage, which is set in the cockpit of an airplane, takes on this German-punkband-like sound, and then there's Teriyaki Yoko. Yoko's stage is set on a far off island and has that Japan-idol-talk influence. It's quite a change, and gamers maybe more inclined to pick up a music game since the tracks now draw a wider audience, while Parappa mainly appealed to hip-hop junkies, like myself.   Oh, and as a side note. In the Japanese version of Um Jammer Lammy, Yoko's level was originally staged in hell. So if you were expecting to see one of the levels being in hell, well, it's not in there. Overall Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos. With the game's new two player mode, the extra Parappa remixes, multiple save options, man, this game has so much more that Parappa didn't have. In fact, the only reason why Parappa the Rapper got such a high score was the fact that it was the first game of its type, and Lammy, well, it is Parappa, but still, it has a whole lot more.   So if you enjoyed Parappa the Rapper, then yes, this is a must have. I'd even go as far as to say that if you were interested in trying out a game of this genre, Um Jammer Lammy would still be a safe purchase. It's a fun game, and if you're not having fun playing it, because you lack rhythm, its still fun to watch -- oh, the colors.  -- Um Jay Boor Lammy", "date": "Aug 19, 1999"}
