{"name": "NFL GameDay 2000", "name_review": "NFL Gameday 2000", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/24/nfl-gameday-2000", "text": "The world champion Denver Broncos approach the line-of-scrimmage, the quarterback takes the snap, he feigns left then delivers the delay hand-off to Terrell Davis, who skirts right, turns on the speed hitting the hole between the offensive tackle and the center and explodes into mid-field for a 23 yard gain. Well in this scenario, the quarterback is not the retired John Elway, but his replacement Bubby Brister, and the game is not a live broadcast but another go at 989 Studio's NFL GameDay 2000.  Gameplay Right off the bat, the thing that will stand out about how this game plays will be the incredible detail in the player animations from the tackles to the user controlled showing-off, although 989 needs to know that players like Barry Sanders do not flex their traps when they get a first down!  Nonetheless, so much ambiance of the actual NFL experience is crammed into this little jewel of a disc, that one must wonder what to expect down the road from the folks over at 989 when PlayStation 2 hits the scene.  Content with playing the latest incarnation of the world famous NFL GameDay, there is much to be pleased with in this year's effort.  The plays are better balanced than years past, with some new running plays that have better blocking assignments.  Pass routes to the outside aren't quite the sure thing they were in other versions of the game, but there are still a few that can stump the CPU on a regular basis, just not as many.  Stepping up the CPU intelligence in the areas of run and pass defense does not actually make the game adjust the defensive players positions, but more so cheats them into position on blown converages.  This is not the ideal way to handle making a game smarter, but it does keep the matches against the CPU more challenging.   The defensive AI is solid though from the onset.  The new Pre-Snap AI scheme has defenders changing or modifying their formations upon reading the offensive formations.  This is done by having the defense play tighter man-to-man coverage on the short yardage downs and by offering a stronger blitz attack when more receivers are on the filed.  In this scenario, the quarterback has less blockers and shifting the D-line to the strong side of the offense when a running play is eminent can shut things down.    On the other hand, the offense is said to possess a Read and Attack AI defensive scheme that can make adjustments on the fly to exploit defense tendencies and weaknesses.  Receivers will run underneath routes after reading zone coverages, run trap blocking during aggressive defensive line stunts and will even have quarterbacks throwing screens to foil the blitz.  I am happy to report I have seen all of this occur; though I am not sure how much of it is due to this new AI routine.  While all this AI talk is great, the game does not properly use the game clock to its advantage and that is unforgivable.  I watched the CPU 49ers blow a 27 field-goal attempt with 11 seconds on the clock before the half...what gives?  That challenge is further enhanced by the ability to shake off tacklers when running with the ball.  You will find that lighter players are not nearly as prone to do this as larger ones, but the amount of speed a runner has upon contact with a defender will play heavily into whether or not he can get more yardage out of the deal or not.  They will actually struggle and surge forward to get that first down.  Moreover, watching all of this unfold is another nice aspect of NFL GameDay 2000.  More than 200 new motions have been captured to enhance the realism of the on-screen action.  There are drag-downs, shoestring catches, upended tackles, chop blocks, stumbles that depict the runner using their hand to push up off the ground to keep running, gang tackling and even shoving.  All of this occurs within the 1,240 new plays that 989 have jammed into the package.  The game is also packed solid with features, like pre-season, season and training camp modes, in addition to playing specifically as a Skill Player, such as a running back or tight end.  Add to that a play editor, create a player features, 150 touchdown dances, old uniforms, and fine-tuned player attributes, and you can see why this game has tons of things to make it shine.  Of course it is fully licensed and, due to the time that the game was released, Barry Sanders is still on your Detroit Lions -- though I want to see him as a Chicago Bear (now that my Uncle Greg Blache is the D-Coordinator this year)!  Moving along, if that is not enough for you, Phil Simms will break out the telestrator and analyze your play, complete with on-screen scribbling!  It does tend to get repetitive quickly though, as the variety of commentary and accompanying illustrations are limited.  What also stands out quickly is the fact there are very few penalties called.  You never seem to fumble, there are no illegal procedure calls and the officials seem non-existent most times.  This seriously detracts from the game's efforts to be a football simulation, despite its very deep statistical database and other well-implemented simulation aspects. Graphics NFL GameDay 2000 is easily the best-looking PlayStation football game to date.  The colors are eye-bleedingly rich, the textures are very robust and the player models, logos, uniforms and fields are all very nice to look at.  The one niggling complaint I have here is the fact that the field markers in the distance should have been softened so the stair stepping that occurs with camera shifts would not be so pronounced. It's distracting. Player size is adjustable in the options menu, as are camera angles and the like.  Graphics and cameras seem to work in tandem, and the combined effort in NFL GameDay 2000 is very well done. You get a good view of the field a majority of the time, with the exception of when you pull back the camera to pre-read the receivers.  From a graphic layout standpoint, I would like to have been able to see the receivers to my extreme left and right sides when I pull back, but that is not the case.  Otherwise, the visual appeal of this game is second to none on its host system, and stands head and shoulders above offerings from other companies.  The game's framerate remains solid at all times and is as smooth as one could expect.  Watching the players tackle and or approach, the line-of-scrimmage is a treat.  Further watching them in motion is rewarding; especially when you see your player spin through a would be tackler or stiff-arm a defender to his knees.   However, as with GameBreaker, there is one aspect of the animation that detracts from the nice work the developers have done on the game.  Guiding your players around the field via any means of control, be it analog or using the D-pad, makes them veer left and right in a sudden, rather unrealistic way.  This is something that should have been addressed years ago, and was to some degree by the initial GameDay's inclusion of ~slide~ adjustment.  That aside, the game does offer more animation advances in the form of numerous yardage advancing efforts like extending for the first down and players churning their legs to push forward through the grasp of a defender.   Sound If you've read my GameBreaker review, then you can pretty much get the sum total of my feelings on the sounds in GameDay as well.  For the most part, every crowd noise and signal call, in addition to the tackle sounds and hits have come from NFL GameDay (#1).  Years of the same tired samples, used over and over again in both the college and professional renditions of a sports game by the same developer, is plain lazy.  Especially when the sounds are sharp, raspy and annoyingly repetitive.  Listen to Madden NFL 2000 and then GameDay 2000 and you will see what I mean.  While GameDay 2000's sounds come off seeming clearer, they are not well mixed and certainly poorly implemented.  What is neat, though not common in real football, is the use of music from the '70s and '80s between downs and changes of possession.  The music is all real stuff from those eras and is coupled with the all too overused NFL GameDay ~We Will Rock You~ foot-stomp handclap routine.  The commentary is fairly good, though sometimes inaccurate. Overall I have been topsy-turvy on who wins the football race each year since GameDay first came to fruition.  A few times, I have very decisively sided with 989 on their football package; this compared to their rival EA Sports' offerings.  In addition, while I did not compose the Madden 2000 review, the score of this game is reflective of where I feel GameDay falls into the scene this year. (In other words, I liked Madden 2000 better.)  That qualified, GameDay 2000 is a stellar title, with tons of options, modes, animations, plays and fun to be had when playing.  It looks great, plays well and is a more than fair representation of US football.  The play calling screens could use a facelift, and the penalties could be implemented to help make the experience of playing the game more pleasant and realistic, but when all is said and done, this is one good game of football.  -- Fabian Blache III", "date": "Aug 24, 1999"}
