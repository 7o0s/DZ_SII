(Make that afterlife, in this case.) And when you're the star of the series that officially introduced the PlayStation Portable to the world, all eyes are on you. Death Jr. is a kid who's felt plenty of pressure in his short time here on and underneath this Earth. At times, he's buckled under that burden, but other times, he's risen to the occasion like a champ. (Those who played through the uneven but aggressive first Death Jr. game know this well.) High expectations are still something that DJ doesn't cope well with, and his second game will probably again draw mixed impressions from those demanding that Death Jr. be the death-dealing platformer maniac he's got the potential to be. But give him a chance to just be himself, and the little creep (as well as his whip-wielding girlfriend, now joined hand in skeletal hand with newly-added multiplayer gaming) may grow on you once again.    What the first Death Jr. did well was put you in harm's way, often and unrelentingly. Death Jr. II: Root of Evil steps it up with bigger beasties, more varied varmints, and smarter snarlies. There are all kinds of evils in this sequel, bringing much-appreciated diversity to the action. They'll come at you from all angles, sprouting out of the ground or swooping down from the air or bursting up from the Toy Crypts to make you more dead than you already are. Fighting back flocks of evil chickens is something I'll take with me to my grave, remembering the burst of feathers floating in the air as my guns cooled down with the last shot fired. Once again, the game engine copes with levels packed with enemies of all sizes without a hitch in framerate. The developers dropped the combo counter on attacks, and there aren't quite as many objects to bust up typically in a stage as there were in DJ1 (we also miss some of the wide-open slaughter yard arenas such as the awesome Suburbia assault mission from the original), but there are now more moves and weapons to play with. There's also an improved camera system, which ditches the manual lock-on of the last game (which took its toll on many gamers' fingers) -- this time, you have more control over your viewpoint, and there's smarter sensing of when the camera should and should swing around in combat for you to attack enemies behind you or to the side without losing your bearings. Here, manual control of the camera is put on the triggers, and if you tap them together, your character goes into a strafe mode for more accurate death-dealing.  This time, DJ is bringing along a friend on his adventure -- the raven-haired, black-eyed beauty Pandora is a playable character this time, doing her part to slay evil instead of just unleashing it as she did last time. The differences in the two characters are unfortunately not all that great, with Pandora's Thorn Whip acting much like DJ's own Scythe and the duo's upgradeable melee attacks often matched by each character (we also wish the game allowed you to switch off characters between levels -- instead, you have to start a new game if you want to play as the other character.) Adding this second playable character also allows for a new multiplayer mode, although this mode feels like little more than an afterthought -- two-player (ad-hoc) mode just has you tripping through whatever stage the host player has unlocked, and the game's enemy count doesn't necessarily jump up when you add a friend (this depends on the difficulty setting you choose.)     What the game lacks in variety from character to character, it makes up for in combat -- there are a good deal of moves to use in fights as well a variety of vicious weapons, with upgrades to be earned for both your abilities and your weaponry as you play. With as many and as varied enemies that this game throws your way, you'll need to work your moves and get the most out of every gun. DJ and Pandora each have a different weapon loadout, beginning with their beginning guns (Death Jr. has his Twin Pistols, while Pandora has a Tommy Gun for faster but less accurate bullet-riddling) and on through the first four weapons they can earn. Each has a type of freeze weapon (and the freeze ability is still that cool slow-mo freeze, slowing down enemies but not stopping them cold when they're on top of you), a flame weapon, and a bomb of some type (Pandora's bomb is an explosive that is triggered when enemies bat at it trying to switch off the awful pop music it's programmed to play; DJ has his trusty C4 Hamsters), and between the characters, there's a mix of which type of weapon is long-ranged or stream-shooting or heat-seeking. The four shared weapons, however -- the Shotgun, Electric Gun, Gas Mine, and Rocket Launcher -- are not all that unique or fun in combat ... which is just as well, since we didn't even know these weapons were unlocked until we had almost finished the game since the weapon-switching mechanism is so screwy. (To be fair, the game tried to remind us to double-tap to switch weapons, but we were a little busy saving humanity and the hellspawn at the time to notice...)    Death Jr. 2 tries much harder to tell its story than the first game (which I'm still not sure I understand ... I know that there was an evil dude, and he turned your friends into gooey puzzle-piece dispensers until you beat him up). It's not a giant success, however -- I think this time, I figured out what the heck was supposed to be going on somewhere about a cinematic and a half before the end boss ... better late than never, I suppose. Funny, the Death Jr. comic book was actually quite good, and there is a ton more work in the storytelling in this game than the original, but it still doesn't work. There's voice-over acting this time, finally bringing to life the rest of DJ's motley crew of friends (including Siamese twins joined at the brain, a bitter bell-jar baby, a goth girl with the truly gothic mark of a stigmata, and a dead guppy named Dead Guppy.) I'm glad to know the team this time, but the audio levels and FMV editing are way off, and a few of the dialog lines are either flat or worse, embarrassingly tacky. (I honestly have a hard time saying anything nice about a game that had Seep the half-formed fetus in a jar say as a joke comeback, ~Suck my cork~...)    On a technical level, Death Jr. performs impressively well the second time, even if a lot of its work is more subtle than special. Its claim to fame in this game is the first-ever use of High-Dynamic Range Lighting in a PSP game -- very cool on paper (HDR is a next-gen technique most often associated with Half-Life 2, now running on a portable machine), but don't come looking for PS3-quality shadow effects and crazy lighting tricks. Instead, HDR's strength here is in the beautiful subtlety it lends the game, lending a soft glow to every surface of the game and smoothing out light levels in the game for a moody look that's never too dark to see what you're doing but never too bright to destroy the atmosphere. (At least, not in stages that are supposed to be dark and eerie -- when you step into the light, the game can shine on with brilliant bloom lighting just as well.) Some gamers will still look at the unimpressive texture work and average character animation and take a pass, but there are plenty of moments of impossible beauty in the game to be experienced. The House of Waffles is possibly the most memorably vibrant stages ever on PSP, a funhouse of infinite colors and non-stop effects as you run through a man-sized pinball machine and a kitchen the size of Hell itself. And all of this unfolds on PSP with the speediest loadtimes of any game on the handheld system, taking 5-10 seconds to load gigantic and seamlessly-streaming levels.    What makes Death Jr. a hard recommendation twice now is how the game is still sloppy in execution despite its best qualities -- it's time for DJ to grow up and scythe straight. The story again makes little sense, despite some funny sequences, and it feels short with only three bosses and little to revisit stages for on your second play. There are some odd design choices in stage design when you're swinging on ropes (why is it that most of the rope-slides in the game seem to go up?), and a few camera problems and control quirks rear up again or anew. The added multiplayer also doesn't make the game much more fun with two than it was with one. However, as nervous as this game left us for the future of Death Jr. (come on guys -- if DJ's Helicopter Spin jump accidentally pushes me off one more ledge that I'm trying to jump up on, I'm going to be giving this boy another crack in that skull of his), the franchise is strong when it barrels down on the action. The gameplay is more smooth and enjoyable in the sequel, with none of the lock-on tapping from last time (it feels a little less hectic because of the camera change, so some may miss the frantic pace of the original, but just crank the difficulty up and you should have plenty to fight with.) Platforming is more sensible and challenging in the sequel, with some clever stages and rewarding secret spots to find. Death Jr. II doesn't prove this chip off the old tombstone to be on par with the greats, but it does give the kid (and Pandora, his gal doomsday) another good chance to reap some mayhem.", "date": "Nov 1, 2006"}
