For a period that enjoys so much attention from amateur historians and hobbyists, it seems like the neglected child of historical strategy games. We get tons of World War 2 games, a surfeit of Medieval games, craptons of fantasy and sci-fi and even the odd Napoleonic wargame or two but when it comes to the Civil War, the War of 1812 and the Texas Revolution, it seems like no one cares enough to even try to make a good game. At least, not since Talonsoft disappeared.  Anyway, the fine folks over at CDV have recently tried to remedy this oversight with their American Conquest series. The third game in the series, titled Divided Conquest, finally focuses the action on the American Civil War and even spills over a bit to capture the battles of New Orleans and the Alamo.   But calling this game a sequel is, I think, going too far. The developers have done little to improve the game mechanics or the visuals far beyond what we saw in the original Cossacks five years ago. Don't get me wrong here -- I'm not the type to complain when games don't make use of the latest and greatest in terms of graphics -- but there are plenty of amazingly fun games that manage to entertain despite being a generation or two behind the times in terms of visuals.  My main complaint is that there's really no difference between this and the other games in the series. There have been a few iterations of Cossacks since then as well as this entirely new American Conquest series but none of them have really tried to improve on the basic mechanics. The limitations of both the camera and the control scheme are still as prominent as ever.  Happily, the strengths have remained too. The massive size of battles is definitely a point in the game's favor. While games like Rome: Total War and Blitzkrieg 2 may present an approximation of large scale battles, it takes a game like American Conquest: Divided Nation to really bring home the reality of thousands of soldiers marching and fighting in the field. Rendering the vast numbers of soldiers involved in these battles has been a hallmark of the Conquest franchise and its Cossacks-branded predecessors. In short, if you want big battles, American Conquest delivers.  After a few minutes of playing you'll start to understand some of the unique problems posed by this approach and why most other games shy away from rendering hundreds and thousands of individual soldiers. The interface in American Conquest isn't really sufficient to manage such numbers and you'll spend as much time fighting against the game's control scheme as you will fighting against the opposing army.  The usual conventions are in place here -- drag selecting, double-clicking to get units of the same type -- but when you're trying to control an entire army made up of several different unit types, it's impossible to manage things efficiently. It makes it even more frustrating when your units can't even find their own way through a gap in a fence. Having to lead a handful of forces through a series of fences while the enemy is massacring thousands of your troops elsewhere will have you uninstalling this game in a hurry.  Setting the movement orders and facing of a unit is easy enough but it's pure guesswork as to exactly how the given unit will fit into a space. Rome: Total War's move preview mode would work well here, particularly when you're trying to line up multiple units. The lack of usable formations for large groups of units is also particularly troublesome. Having to move each group of soldiers individually (and line them up without a clear reference) results in lots of messy looking battle lines.  Another big problem with the interface is that there are only two zoom levels. One is much too close to provide any awareness of the overall battle and the other is so far out that it's pretty much impossible to tell which troops are which. Adding another two or three zoom levels in between these views would definitely give gamers a chance to find the level that suits their need. As it is, neither of the game's zoom levels really works well enough to give you a sense of both involvement and tactical knowledge. As an added aggravation, the game zooms in, not on the center of the expanded view but off to the side. It's not uncommon to go from the wider view to the narrow one and become hopelessly lost.      Stepping back to the positives for a minute, I'm a big fan of morale modeling in games. Too many games make it easy on the player by letting them march their men off into the meat grinder. While it's a strategy that has worked in the real world, it relies more on the weight of numbers than on actual tactical thinking. That American Conquest: Divided Nations forces players to maintain at least some semblance of concern for their soldiers is admirable. Sure, it's a pain to have to gather up individual soldiers when a unit routs and, sure, it's lame that the game isn't more vocal about it when your units are losing morale, but the way the game forces players to take care of their soldiers is definitely commendable.  The wide array of soldiers available is both a blessing and a curse, however. On the one hand, it's thrilling to know that there are dozens of different types of infantry, cannon and cavalry here. It certainly speaks to the historical research that's gone into the game. Still, you can't escape the fact that the units are almost entirely interchangeable. One rifleman may be different from another but it's impossible for a gamer to tell the difference in their performance or, in many cases, appearance. Though historically appropriate, the fact that your enemy has pretty much the same troops as you do tends to reinforce this sense of monotony.   Luckily, there are tons of campaigns and scenarios you can use to get your brain wrapped around each of these units. Campaigns focusing on the Civil War are obviously the star attraction here and you can take them on from either the Union or Confederacy side. If Grant and Lee don't appeal to you, you can easily drop yourself into either the Mexican or Texan side of the Texas Revolution or even control the American forces during the Battle of New Orleans. Predictably, each campaign consists of large, set-piece battles. You can get a more traditional RTS base-building approach in the game's skirmish mode.  There's no escaping the fact that the graphics are dated here. While there may be lots of cool stuff going on below the surface, the engine simply can't stand up against more recent RTS games. We're willing to excuse a certain amount of this based purely on the numbers of troops involved but games like Imperial Glory have managed to present better looking soldiers and environments on a smaller but no less exciting scale. And it manages to do it with pretty much exactly the same system requirements listed on the Divided Nation box. The less said about the scenery tears and the bizarre pop-in, the better.  Frankly, there's no reason whatsoever that the specs on this game should exceed those on, say, Empire at War, but they totally do. What really confuses me is that it seems like Empire at War should be the more demanding game. It certainly looks a lot better and runs much more smoothly than American Conquest does. It's completely baffling to me that I can be on a PC that runs Oblivion with nary a hitch and still have to contend with stuttering performance from an expansion pack to a game that was released three years ago. RTS games have come a long way in the five years between the original Cossacks and Divided Nation. While I certainly wouldn't expect the developer to incorporate all of the advancements we've seen since then, it's disappointing that practically nothing has been done to bring this game up to date. I can still see a few die-hard fans sticking with it out of sheer obstinacy but the competition in the genre is too strong for the rest of us to spend any time at all with this one.", "date": "Apr 14, 2006"}
