Some are just quick attempts to cash in on the popularity of a license or materials left over from development. Others bring to the basic game new and greater levels of enjoyment and interest. Ghost Recon Desert Siege is neither of these. It is, instead, a worthy supplement to the original game. It adds a batch of evolutionary, incremental changes without adding anything revolutionary or essential to your enjoyment of the original game. But considering that we thought Ghost Recon was good enough to be our Game of the Year, maybe change isn't necessarily called for here.  Desert Siege moves the focus on the conflict from the Eastern Europe to East Africa. A conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia is well underway and the Ghosts have been sent in to stop it. The Ghosts won't be doing anything terribly different this time around; they'll just be doing it in a different place. Its topical nature aside, the story's not any more consequential than that of Ghost Recon. Like last time, I spent my time running through the missions focused almost exclusively on killing terrorists and letting the less direct objectives fall where they may. Thankfully, the folks at Red Storm anticipated this and killing all the terrorists is as good a way to win the game as any. (For the record, people who are fixated on accomplishing the objectives in an anal kind of way will also be rewarded for their obsessive behavior.)  Missions are drawn from the conventions established in the last game (and every other tactical shooter now that I think about it). Rescuing workers, disarming bombs and destroying SAM sites are all on the menu for the Ghosts. There's an overall story behind it, but as in Ghost Recon, the story is merely the excuse for the action. It shouldn't be ignored at all but from a standpoint of interest, it pales in comparison to the action within the missions.   From a graphics and sound standpoint, the expansion is easily as good as the previous game. The desert theme of the game gets a little tiresome quite honestly but there's enough variety in the levels to keep the overall experience from seeming monotonous. Gamers will fight on beaches, winding canyons and oil refineries each in their turn and each level is as natural-looking and detailed as they were in Ghost Recon.  Naturally Desert Siege includes the latest patch for Ghost Recon. An automatic running option can be toggled on and off according to your preferences. More sophisticated mip-mapping reduces the flicker that occurred at far distances in Ghost Recon. One of my complaints about the previous game was the lack of quick load access from the end mission screen. Basically if all your soldiers died and you failed to load a saved game in time before the game dumped you to the mission results screen, you had to continue to back out of the game and reload it from a separate location. It's not much but it's a notable convenience. Lots of smaller changes have been incorporated as well but they involve relatively minor balance issues.   What did you think of Desert Siege?  A few changes have been made to the AI. While we though the AI in the first game was quite good, this time around it's even better. It makes much better use of cover for one thing. If you come across a large group of enemies, expect them to scatter pretty quickly once you attack. You'll then have to contend with numerous enemies peeking around and over obstacles to take quick shots at you. It seemed in the last game that the AI was almost entirely unaware that they possessed grenades. This time around they've got no problem hucking grenade after grenade at your position, often with a frustratingly high degree of accuracy.  Improvements have been added on the multiplayer side as well. Leaderboards are available in real-time during the game and display lots of information about your performance. Better support is being offered as well to help smooth over some of the rough edges of many of the games mods. In-game messages are now also color-coded to match the appropriate teams. And just so you're totally clear on who's on your team, a color-coded IFF feature will let you see who needs protecting and who needs shooting.      The bigger news on the multiplayer side is the addition of two new game types. Domination keeps players occupied in a fight for ownership of several strategic locations scattered across the map. Once a particular location is occupied exclusively by members of one team, they control of the area and begin earning points. At the end of a pre-determined time limit, the team with the most points wins. Siege mode pits two teams against one another. One team is tasked with defending a fixed installation while other teams try to infiltrate it. If an assault team gets someone in the central capture zone for five seconds before time expires, they win the match. Both new games require a slight shift in approach but don't really change the gameplay too terribly much. Nine new multiplayer-only weapons have been added as well.  Those of you who are hoping to get your hands on some of the tools for the game will be pleased to see that a full-feature editing toolkit has been included.  3dStudio MAX editor plug-ins and the Red Storm software designed for lighting and texture attributes will be included in the retail version of the game (and be available for download off of the Ghost Recon site). A fifty-page electronic manual supposedly spells out the details of this but the readme files on the disc mostly discuss scripting.  Reviewing expansion packs is a little tricky. You've got to judge them on their own merits but so much depends on the strength of the basic game. Red Storm's usually been pretty slack with their expansions, preferring to rely on just a handful of new missions to generate interest and Desert Siege definitely fits the mold. But the difference between this expansion and last year's Black Thorn is that this franchise still has enough momentum and freshness to justify you buying and playing the expansion.There aren't that many missions and the two new multiplayer modes aren't as compelling as the existing ones. But more of the same is definitely a good thing for the Ghost Recon franchise, at least while we're still not too far removed from the original game's release. For only twenty dollars you get a few more hours of tense single player excitement and some notable general performance enhancements both in single player and multiplayer. That alone is more than worth your time and attention.", "date": "Mar 29, 2002"}
