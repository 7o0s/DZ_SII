It's pretty well-known that one of the worst games ever created during the era of the original PlayStation was Acclaim's own take on the crimefighting foursome. With the revitalization of the series thanks to the summer theatrical release, Activision's trying its hand on the franchise. While it's not nearly as awful as the PSX release nearly a decade ago, the Game Boy Advance rendition is bland and uncreative, and an incredibly short and underwhelming action title. Nowhere near fantastic, that's for sure.   The film itself has its ups and downs in quality and storytelling, and while it most likely will never be considered a true comic book movie masterpiece like Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins, the 20th Century Fox release had its enjoyable moments. That's a polite way of saying that the movie didn't quite suck. This GBA game, too, doesn't quite hit the ~suck~ bar, but it's pretty close.   Because the movie strangely featured very little in the way of superheroesque ~crime fighting,~ the developers took a few liberties with the story structure and threw in a few bad guys to battle. Now there's a whole lot of clobberin' time with enemy fodder including rogue robots and reanimated dinosaurs running through the eight levels of action. But even with the creative detour in the story, the developers never bothered to inject anything new or interesting in the game design, and it really boils down to a lifeless Double Dragon clone with absolutely no focus in technique. It's just a button-masher.   It's called Fantastic 4, but most of the time it's just the Mediocre 2; most of the levels in the game break the team up into pairs, and players can choose to control either character with a tap of the L trigger to cycle between them. Occasionally the action brings all four together for a bigger battle, but 90 percent of the game is simply two of the four running around the levels, with the computer controlling the non-player chosen character. Each character is balanced for their own unique attributes; Mr. Fantastic's stretchiness can give him better reach, while The Invisible Woman can extend shields around friends and sneak past enemies. The Human Torch flies around on fire shooting balls at a distance, and The Thingwell, he's just a bully, but if you have him in the level, chances are you'll just take him all the way to the end since he can kick everyone's ass. Each character has a mild assortment of moves including special techniques using shoulder button/action button combos, but honestly, the game's so easy with predictable enemies that all it takes it a strong thumb to mash the A or B button all the way through.   The entire Fantastic 4 experience takes place in an isometric perspective, giving a 3D style freedom for the Double Dragon style action. It's glitchy, though, and the game has some hard times keeping track of objects that are supposed to be behind or in front. Computer controlled teammates get confused when levels change altitude, with the partner getting stuck up high while the player remains down below. The glitches aren't many, but they are there; ignore them and the game doesn't look all that bad. It's just not going for any sort of style points beyond a standard-looking GBA title.   There are opportunities for Lost Vikings style puzzle designs by using each character's unique traits, but their implementation are so unimaginative because the solutions aren't challenging. Tasks are lit up like a neon sign with specific colored ~4~ logos dotting the way; by putting the proper character in the circle, the character will automatically perform the context-sensitive action; Mr. Fantastic will stretch through bars to get at a hidden terminal for a silly ~hacking~ minigame, or The Thing will hang off a platform to get at up-high enemies. These are the only elements that are offered between the button-mashing brawler, but they do nothing to make the game interesting.  The GBA game was clearly made on the cheap and quickly, which leaves very little room for the creative process. It's even missing one feature that the franchise begs for: multiplayer. There are far better brawler-type games on the Game Boy Advance with much more depth, like River City Ransom, Double Dragon. There's not much here but a bland game design utilizing a tarnished brand.", "date": "Jul 18, 2005"}
