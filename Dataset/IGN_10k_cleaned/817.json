It would be nice if each one had something unique and different to offer, but at this point we'd be happy if each one just did one thing right. Kemco's Top Gear Hyperbike isn't all bad, but the good ideas and innovations, as is the case with so many games, get overshadowed by poor mechanics and fundamentals like graphics and animation. In the end, the good does not outweigh the bad and Hypberbike doesn't get the job done.  The Facts:  Features fully animated riders with realistic stunts and bone-crushing crashes. Full complement of bikes: three styles of dirt-bikes, street bikes and secret bikes. Six unique track layouts, including Egyptian Ruins, Redwood Forest and Streets of Florence. Three difficulty levels. 16MB (128 Megabit) cart. Expansion Pak support for enhanced visuals. Championship, Time Attack and Street modes. Developed by Snowblind Studios (Top Gear Overdrive).   Gameplay The game has some good ideas and all of them could have lead to some great gameplay elements if only the game was simply okay to look at and listen to.   The Championship mode has you alternating between dirt and street racing as you compete for points. You earn new bikes and courses along the way like many other games, but interesting twist is going from one kind of racing to the other. The physics of each type of racing are very different, and you'll have to switch back and forth between dirt and racing tactics on the fly.  The dirt bike racing is a lot more arcadey with all of the jumps and wide open tracks. You can earn turbo by pulling off tricks and there's really nothing to stop you from testing your  stunt skills while racing except your own nerve and imagination. In this way, Hyperbike is like Hydro Thunder where you're expected to lean on that turbo button the whole time and it's up to your racing skills to ensure there's turbo available.   The track editor is neat in that you simply start off with an oval and it's up to you to mold and stretch and distort it into something spectacular. The key element of any kind of track editor, in any kind of game is that it allows you to create something better than or at least on par with the tracks built into the game, even the tough ones. Hyperbike's editor allows you to do just that. The control is intuitive as you set these contact points anywhere on a preset oval track that can be moved, raised and lowered basically anyway you please. If you try to create too sharp of a turn or something, it won't allow you to set a point. However, it will allow you to create some abrupt landscapes and then the best part is you get to test it yourself. We were able to come up with some devastating, almost impossible inclines and blind turns. Just what you want out of a track editor.  The trick attack mode is a nice way to learn all of the tricks available to you. Like the track editor, the trick attack mode only runs with the dirt tracks and bikes. This lead us to believe that the street bike racing was more of an after thought than a basic premise of the game.   As we said these are all splendid ideas and features that would have been better spent on a better looking, smoother playing game.  Graphics This is where we run into serious trouble. In our preview of this game, we told you that there will six independently animated polygons for each rider. We now know that six independently animated polygons per rider are not enough to make this game look good. The animations themselves make sense with guys leaning and reaching and stretching as you jump and ride and perform stunts, they just don't look right.  When competing in motorbike events, shifting your weight --throwing your ass to one side or the other-- does more in changing the direction you and your bike are headed than anything. Why then is the butt polygon, or whatever you want to call it, so awkwardly animated in Hyperbike? The legs lean side to side when you're making extremely difficult turns, but this is not what convinces us that your little motorcycle guy is fighting gravity and centrifugal force. With six animated polygons per rider, which still doesn't seem like enough in our opinions, we need most of them to represent the rider's center of gravity to convince us of realistic rider physics.  The blurs are a discouraging factor as well in Hyperbike. Let's put it this way, there's a reason why Kemco included brightness control under the option menu. It's because the game's default setting, ~brightness off~, is nice and dark so as to better hide the blurry textures and slight framerate problems. If you do decide to shed some light on the subject, and turn brightness on, you'll be able to see a lot more of the pretty colors, but they'll look all soft and fuzzy.   Sound The music is appropriate and there are some snazzy little rider sounds but the audio isn't much to get excited or even hyper about.  When you perform tricks your little guy will yell out a little yeehaw and the announcer, even on outdoor tracks, chimes in with useful info and encouragement. All of the comments are crisp, clear, and best of all, short.   When you crash or use your turbo you're treated to an underwhelming collection of sounds. The turbo sounds like someone busting a water pipe with a hammer and the subsequent whoosh of water that goes with it. When you crash, instead of the clanking, grinding and screams of pain you so desperately want, you get the sound of someone stomping their foot. Once.  Hyperbike is the third of the four motorbike racers that were originally due out last holiday season. This game is brand new, but I can't help but think TGHB feels a little dated. The graphics look like something from 1998 and far below what we've seen in Supercross 2000 and what we will see in Excitebike 64. I'll give it the nod over Jeremy McGrath but that's almost by default because of the incredible poor showing Acclaim made with that game. Physics and animation are the most important parts of motorbike racers we now know. In fact that's pretty much all Supercross had going for it. To overlook or downplay these two parts of your game, even with great ideas elsewhere is to ignore exactly what fans of the genre are looking for when they walk into their videogame retailer. Fortunately for motorbike racer fans, the best is yet to come and we can tell you that Hyperbike is not it.", "date": "Mar 28, 2000"}
