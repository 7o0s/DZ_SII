{"name": "Alone in the Dark", "name_review": "PC Retroview: Alone in the Dark", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/01/pc-retroview-alone-in-the-dark", "text": "There were a lot of PC games released before IGNPC was conceived through the union of IGN and PC, and some of these games were so good and influenced the design of so many other games that they deserve a little space of their own on IGNPC. That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.    In the introduction to Alone in the Dark, Edward Carnby introduces himself.  ~The few friends I have call me Carnby,~ he writes, ~the others call me the Reptile.  I don't care to think what my banker calls me.~  It's 1920 and he's a down-on-his-luck private detective hired to investigate a suicide at Derceto, a storied manor with an eerie past.  ~My idea of a paid vacation,~ he quips.  Although the hard-boiled detective stuff is dropped after it's established (there is no voiceover character commentary in Alone in the Dark), it's a much more auspicious beginning than the kind of laughable stuff that passes for horror in games these days.  Titles like Resident Evil are all good and well with their high-res pre-rendered backgrounds and zombies slathered in gore textures.  But then you uncover ludicrous storylines about revolting mitochondria (Parasite Eve) or the Raccoon City Police Department's S.T.A.R.S. unit (Resident Evil) or military experiments (just about any contemporary horror game).  The minute someone opens his mouth, most horror games become badly translated cartoons.  Even the PlayStation's Silent Hill, arguably the best horror game on any platform, features some unintentionally hilarious dialogue.  Although the genre of ~survival horror~ began with Alone in the Dark, it didn't get a name until Resident Evil's loading screen, which read, ~Welcome to the world of survival horror.~  It was the same sort of clunky Englishification that characterized all the dialogue in that game.  It was that stilted mastery of the language that gave us names like Donkey Kong and Jet Grind Radio and instructions for our VCRs. Now it's given us the name of an entire genre.  Survival horror?  It sounds like you're on a trip with Outward Bound and someone forgot to pack the granola bars.  Alone in the Dark begins with a device that Half-Life used to brilliant effect.  The opening scenes show Carnby walking through the house up into the attic, where the actual gameplay begins.  It's an example of showing you what you're going to see later as a bit of foreshadowing.  You also see in Alone in the Dark the first instance of The Thing Breaking through the Window, a standard device in any survival horror game.  It's also one of the first zombie games and an early example of the use of polygonal characters in a game.  But Alone in the Dark is unique for avoiding quirks that take you out of the game (let's forget about the silly voice work slapped onto the CD-ROM version, shall we?).  Without any overwrought storytelling or dippy character comments, it moves at its own pace and stays true to the tone it establishes.  The story is furthered through well-written snippets from journals and ancient texts sprinkled throughout the game.  They do not hit you over the head; they are subtle and sometime vague, but sometimes crucial -- for instance, the historical account of using the Aztec statue against the suit of armor, how to defeat the Vagabond in the library, and the use of the mirrors against the creatures on the staircase.  These texts succeed in giving Alone in the Dark the strongest Lovecraft flavor in any game I've played (Prisoner of Ice would be the only other authentically Lovecraft-flavored game).  Not only does Alone in the Dark include references to Deep One, Old Ones, Cthonians, Shub Niggurath, and the Necronomicon, but there are also cameos from some of them.  The history of Derceto is loosely based on a doomed artist from one of Lovecraft's short stories.  Unfortunately, the game hasn't aged very well.  The monsters look awful.  There are no lighting effects and only minimal sound (although what's there is pretty effective, particularly the weird glassy musical riff).  The third person perspective is an early and egregious instance of fighting the camera to play the game; although the fixed perspectives are suitably eerie, they'll often get you killed and they completely confuse any situational awareness about how the house is laid out.  Alone in the Dark should have included a map, in part to help you get around, but also because it was an early example of good level design.  The puzzles are generally pretty easy, mainly because you can plow past many of them by fighting your way past a zombie or two.  They're woven together in a non-linear fashion, so there aren't a lot of choke points where you'll be stuck.  Alone in the Dark featured the now standard limited inventory.  You can only carry so many items, but it's not always clear what you can safely throw away.  For instance, early on you find an old cavalry sword that breaks after you use it a few times.  Naturally, you throw it away -- only to discover several hours later that you need it for a puzzle but have no idea where you left it.  The end of the game is a little disappointing, since Alone in the Dark goes from being a great haunted house adventure to a stunted dungeon romp.  And the end boss, a tree that spits fireballs, is hardly what you'd expect to find at the root of all this evil.    But Alone in the Dark is also unique for not being a game about combat.  Most ~survival horror~ emphasizes zombie killing to satisfy action-hungry console gamers.  But there are precious few weapons in Alone in the Dark.  As far as I could tell, for all the weapons combined, there are no more than a dozen rounds of ammo in the entire game.  Also, taking damage is pretty much a one-way street; by my count, there are only three opportunities to heal hit points.  Alone in the Dark is about working your way around monsters rather than fighting through them.    Unfortunately, combat is ridiculously easy.  By repeatedly kicking, you can defeat almost any monsters.  Once you get a simple kitchen knife, you're practically unstoppable.  The fight with the pirate ghost requires a bit of thought and there are some monsters that just can't be killed.  But overall, Alone in the Dark is not about fighting monster.  Sadly, this concept was completely abandoned in the later games in the series, which also strayed far from the Lovecraft mythos.  Most of Alone in the Dark 2 pitted Carnby against the undead gangster pirate One Eyed Jack and his Tommy gun wielding posse.  There was, however, a part later in the game where you played as a kidnapped girl Carnby was trying to rescue.  This was more like the original Alone in the Dark, but it was only a small part of the sequel.  In Alone in the Dark 3, you're back to Carnby the Ass-Kicking Private Dick, fighting zombie cowboys and Indians to stop a terrible plot along the San Andreas Fault.  Yawn.    That the two sequels couldn't live up to the original is hardly surprising considering the creator of Alone in the Dark, Frederick Raynal, had moved on and left the license behind at I-Motion, which would later become Infogrames.  Raynal founded Adeline, the makers of Little Big Adventures 1 & 2 (called Relentless and Twinsen's Odyssey in the U.S.) and Time Commando.  Adeline was later absorbed by Sega and renamed No Cliche.  They have since made Toy Commander for the Dreamcast.  As for a following up on the tone and sensibility of the first Alone in the Dark, Infogrames' fourth installment in the series is probably the last place you'd want to look.  A group of developers in Paris called Darkworks (with no continuity from Raynal's team, as far as I can tell) has turned Edward Carnby into a hip Gabriel Knight look-a-like and they've armed him with weapons like a Disk-Launcher, a Laser Gun, and a Plasma Torch.  Infogrames will strip Carnby of his handlebar mustache and publish Alone in the Dark IV on a variety of platforms sometime next year.    However, Raynal's No Cliche is working on a horror game for the Dreamcast called Agartha.  This is potentially a much more faithful follow-up to his Alone in the Dark than Darkworks' project.  The limited information and screenshots for Agartha indicate a game in which a gray-haired guy who looks like G.I. Joe explores a hidden city that could destroy the world.  Hmm, doesn't Cthulhu live in a hidden city?  Even more promising is a game with the license from Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu role-playing game.  The British developers at Headfirst Games are working on Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.  It's a first person perspective game with an emphasis on avoiding combat and mechanics for insanity, an important and often overlooked concept in Lovecraft's mythos.  Unfortunately, Dark Corners of the Earth doesn't have a publisher yet.  And in the meantime, Alone in the Dark really doesn't hold up very well.  -- Tom Chick Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  An effective and minimalist storyline drawn heavily from Lovecraft and told through ancient texts.   8.0  Graphics  Was 1992 really only eight years ago?  It looks much, much longer...    3.0  Sound  What's there is greatbut there's not much to it.   6.0  Gameplay  True horror is not about combatneither is Alone in the Dark.  One of the best ~survival horror~ games ever in terms of gameplay.   8.0  Lasting Appeal  Far too short and it closes with an unfulfilling ending.   3.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Although there's little hope for another game like it, it's better to wish hard than find out how poorly this game has held up over the years.  A classic? Yes.  A timeless classic? No.  No  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   6.0 Sadly, modern horror games are all about shooting zombies in the head, more George Romero than H.P. Lovecraft, more bloodsport than horror.  If you're looking for a horror game, the best you can do is get Silent Hill for the PlayStation and wistfully remember how good Alone in the Dark was back in 1992.", "date": "Nov 1, 2000"}
