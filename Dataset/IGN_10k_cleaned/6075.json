{"name": "SLAI", "name_review": "S.L.A.I.", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/23/slai", "text": "Konami's Steel Lancer Arena International is a mechanized arena-based combat game. It features highly configurable SVs (futuristic mechs with legs or wheels), a massive singleplayer game, a good-sized multiplayer mode, and genuinely excellent presentation. These positives help create a fundamentally complete offering. Regardless of what you like to do, you'll at least have something to do. S.L.A.I.'s problem, however, is in the actual doing.   The biggest component of S.L.A.I. is its singleplayer campaign. In it players take control of an upgradeable personality and rent or purchase their own fighting SVs to take into the Hard-Wired fray of the future.   The whole singleplayer interface takes place within the virtual confines of some elaborate cyberspace. The Hyper Advanced Virtual Environment Network allows players to make all of the appropriate purchases and sales related to their SV so that they'll be ready to brawl in the next scheduled event, though the passage of time isn't so linear as to require specific scheduling. In fact, you can always fight. But before any of that happens, it's important to explore the breadth of HAVEN. This is where S.L.A.I. really shines.   The virtual world is heavily trafficked and comes complete with nifty chat prompts, crashes, lag, and other nicely presented computer-like effects to believably deliver the innards of a populated regional server. It's a very cool way of funneling gamers into a cohesive universe and keeping them there, but it's also functional.  In HAVEN there's an extensive series of tutorials to acquaint gamers with basic and more advanced Rumbling (what robot fighting is called). But beyond that there are seamlessly connected machinist shops, configuration areas, garages, SV manufacturers, music stores, and more.  The primitive TRON-like environment of HAVEN that features all this works exceptionally well for S.L.A.I., even if there is a good bit of back and forth navigation involved. But, it's the level of completeness that really impresses us. The singleplayer interface features an extraordinary wealth of information and options. So good job!   Seasonal play, however, isn't quite as exciting as the presentation. This is largely because S.L.A.I.'s gameplay, for however customizable it may be, is quite bland. The combat setup is at least still great, however.  Run Straight, Shoot Much  Think of S.L.A.I. as a series of coliseums. Each is somewhat different in appearance (docks from streets from ruins) and each is open all the time. Players can saunter into any one of these coliseums and battle with automated drones and rival combatants for as long as they wish. Dealt damage translates into money. Sustained damage translates into a penalty. So the objective is to go in, blow the hell out of other things, make sure you don't die in the process, and eventually exit in one piece. S.L.A.I. even offers multiple camera angles and control schemes, so coming to grips with the ~don't die~ gameplay shouldn't be a real problem.  The game also allows for thousands upon thousands of  SV combinations; even specific modules within a mech can be further customized. But then actual play doesn't represent any of this. The game, for as fast and clumsy as it is, never requires pre-match strategic thinking and planning. This either leads to well equipped and exceedingly powerful mechs, or ones that are just completely useless. On or off, you know?  In our first run we began with a Hartman SV, tossed two heavy machineguns onto our shoulders and put their rough equivalents into our hands. Then we rampaged. It's great that S.L.A.I. allowed us to make the exact mech we desired, but the balancing is off. We were allowed to make a nearly invincible SV right away. And so in the very first official Rumble we scored over 60 kills and took literally no damage in the process (at least according to the post-fight analysis). It was that easy.       Eventually the challenge level increases, but so does the player's ability to outfit an SV with even more appropriately devastating equipment. We eventually found that some long-ranged armor piercing guns coupled with close quartered melee attacks would absolutely destroy anything. At that point we didn't even bother with the more advanced in-game maneuvers. Rushing in with guns blazing and fists swinging is far more effective than struggling with the unresponsive jumping mechanisms, anyway.   S.L.A.I., you see, is plagued by some pretty poor collision detection that will prevent any dramatic leaps over rubble or quick sideways bursts through obstructions. So even if maneuvering beyond the realm of circle strafing were required, it still wouldn't work well. It's very clunky and unforgiving in that way.   All these problems work to force players into a specific type of gameplay: Get in, cloak, punch some poor bastard in the back when he's not looking. While the basics are all in place, and there's nothing seriously wrong with the approach, the back-punching prevents any genuinely cool action from ever happening, which ultimately gives S.L.A.I. it's functional, classically good, but totally underdeveloped kind of gameplay.  It doesn't help that there are some more real problems with S.L.A.I.'s engine and environments. All the levels are small and static, which doesn't fit well with the ~giant robot running amok~ theme. The game also looks generic. There are no dazzling explosive effects, lush particles, or whiz-bang filters (for when you get punched and lose your robot's teeth, for instance).   All the good and the bad mentioned above carries over to online play. It's there that gamers can engage in some heated four-way fights, while other gamers line up in the queue. The in and out system of combat really works well online and in the matches we've played we didn't experience any gameplay altering lag or performance issues. A good chunk of the meticulous presentation and customizability even carries over, as do rankings, which promise players with their own rigs will be able to find the right opponents...assuming there ever are any.   And that's the online kicker. We really haven't found anyone to play with since S.L.A.I. released. Most of the time when we logon we're presented with three continents of empty servers. It's a shame, too. If the multiplayer community picks up S.L.A.I. could really be something neat, assuming we can all get past the straightforward action.  Blue Thunder Few games can claim to feature as much stuff as S.L.A.I. The singleplayer game is huge, the multiplayer game is deep, the presentation is spot-on, the soundtrack is large and diverse... It's clear the developers put serious effort into this one. And yet it still manages to fall apart at points. Despite offering so much, S.L.A.I.'s combat can get very tedious. The environments are seriously constricting and the collision detection is bad enough that it's never really possible to develop a good flow -- vainly trying to jump over a small ledge for the millionth time really diminishes the feeling of piloting a powerful war machine, anyway. There are also some odd balancing issues which can bring down engagements. In the end it often feels like cheap rush tactics and auto-targeting are what help win fights, not skill.The graphics are also bad enough that playing is never a truly exciting, interesting event. And since enemies constantly work their way into the arena, killing them isn't very satisfying, either. There's just another SV waiting at the door, so what does it matter?But even with these faults, S.L.A.I. is so big, fans of arena-based shooters would be wrong to pass it up. It's a huge game with a good deal of replay value and a very cool online mode (assuming it ever gets used). Coming to terms with the graphical and gameplay limitations means being able to enjoy a well presented, fresh experience, so at least give this one a try.", "date": "Sep 23, 2005"}
