And it was good. It suffered its fair share of first-generation, launch-title issues, but it was definitely the title to get when the system shipped in June of 2001. The success of that title, both inside and outside of North America, prompted the company to continue the Castlevania line on the handheld, and the result is Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance. This game trounces the original in almost every way, making the adventure a much more fun and ultimately more satisfying adventure on the Game Boy Advance. Features More than ten hours playtime Two playable characters Unlockable Boss battle mode Cartridge save (Four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance takes place about fifty years after the original Castlevania, with players assuming the role of Simon Belmont's grandson, Juste. This guy, looking like a refugee from Ziggy Stardust, is the next in the Dracula-slaying line. Maxim, Juste's best pal, shows up all beat up...informing Juste that Lydie, a mutual friend, had been kidnapped and taken to Dracula's castle. So, it's time to put that whip in hand and do a little damage to all of Dracula's little cronies.  It's very much like the designers looked at everything that was successful from the past 2D Castlevania games, and created an adventure using all these elements. The dangling chain-like whip play mechanic and graphic effect from Super Castlevania IV make a return to the scene, and players power-up, equip, and upgrade their character's abilities by defeating enemies, picking up icons, and manipulating the items in the options menu. The DSS card engine from COTM has been replaced with a much simpler magic system, which makes using items and their powerful abilities a lot more easier to do. The shoulder buttons offer an extremely clever ~dash~ and ~retreat~ mechanic that's no idle gimmick -- certain enemies will attack in such a way that you'll have to ~dodge~ out of the way by hitting the appropriate shoulder button. The castle is absolutely massive with dozens of different areas to explore, with an ~alternate dimension~ version of that castle overlapping it; the game's level design is so clever that you have to traverse from one castle to the other, performing one task that will affect that area in the other castle. The secondary castle design element can get a little confusing, especially when transporting from one area to another: the only way you're going to know which castle you've appeared in is to either check your map, or to have a keen eye on the surroundings and enemies. You'll even find basic crate-pushing gameplay elements that will gain your character access to other parts of the castle. When all is said and done, you'll pour more than a dozen hours into exploring one hundred percent of the area. And it's a very fulfilling experience all the way through.  There are some oddities to the game design, though. The whole Pokemon collection thing has even affected the Castlevania developers: throughout the game, you can pick up furniture and knickknacks all over the place...and if you find the special hidden room, you can drop off these items and furnish the room. And then, there's the shopkeeper inside Dracula's castle...they kind of just wave off his origins. You'll need his help, sure, but it's just odd to stumble upon him in several locations throughout the game.  The first Game Boy Advance adventure was excellent in its own right, but the biggest disappointment was in how Circle of the Moon didn't follow in its precursors' footsteps in the technical sense. Ever since the series debuted on the Super NES a decade ago, it's been sort of a showcase for special effects and techniques, utilizing the system hardware's strengths to provide its gaming experience. Circle of the Moon barely offered any of that ~ooh neat~ factor to the table, a letdown especially with what the Game Boy Advance was capable of...even in its first year. Harmony of Dissonance makes up for COTM's graphical shortcomings in a big way. The contrast has been bumped up from the first game's dark imagery to something a lot more GBA-friendly, for one thing, which obviously means Konami listened to players' complaints from COTM. The GBA's sprite effects are put to great use in several places throughout the game; gigantic knights flow with incredible fluidity thanks to the rotating parts that form its body, doors fling open and shut with a really clever 3D effect, and some level geometry are even affected by whipping support beams. Enemies even fade in and out using the GBA's transparency abilities.  But, there was definitely a trade-off providing all these nifty and welcome special effects: the music quality isn't anywhere near as impressive as last year's Castlevania offering on the Game Boy Advance. The digital ~orchestrations~ just can't come close to what past games in the series featured as soundtracks, both in their quality and in their compositions. With all the graphics techniques poured into the game, we're just a little upset that the music took a back seat...though the end credits scroll does feature a nicely mixed version of the game's first background music piece.  To extend the life of the game beyond the dozen or so hours it takes to complete the game, Konami included the usual extras that become unlocked after you defeat the ~bad guy~ of the game. After the credits scroll, a boss battle challenge opens up, giving players the opportunity to charge through an arena that will put their boss-defeating techniques to the test...the best times are recorded to cartridge. You'll also be able to play as Maxim during your second time through the game, and you can even find a cameo of Simon's NES sprite hidden somewhere after the end of the adventure. Lots of neat little things you can do after you've finished the game. It's almost a no-brainer to learn that a new 2D Castlevania ends up being one of the best games on the system, but hey, it has to be said: Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is really great. The gameplay techniques, the graphics, the length of the quest, all top-notch. The music isn't quite as bad as importers have made it out to be, but yes...the tunes aren't nearly as nice as they have been in past Castlevania adventures.If there's any one thing to complain about (besides the music), it's the drastic change in difficulty. Circle of the Moon was definitely a much, much harder challenge in the boss battles...almost unfairly so. The developers went back and reworked the bosses, giving them attacks that have patterns that can be avoided, dodged and countered. There are no cheap attacks in this game, other than maybe the very last boss in the adventure.If you haven't already put this on your ~must-have~ list for Game Boy Advance titles, now's the time.", "date": "Sep 16, 2002"}
