Everybody and their mother has played one of these games before and at this point there are so many good ones out there that are budget priced, new titles have to be more clever, more creative, and have to look better than we've seen in the past. Sniper: Path of Vengeance is none of these. This kind of game is why we give you the ~just plain bad~ option in the review poll.   Leaving the title out of this, which some people may suddenly find offense to regardless of the fact that it was planned and released before the DC sniper decided he was God, Sniper is still a wretched piece of trash that should have been left on the Island of Misfit Toys. Unfortunately, all of the other misfit toys took offense at its presence and told it to take a hike. So here we are with the sad problem of having Sniper sitting on store shelves. I'll save you the time of reading the entire review. Don't buy this game. Half-Life, which came out in 1998 looks and plays better, and is a much better value than this value priced tripe.    Sniper follows the story of a hitman called ~The Sniper~. He's one of the best in the industry, following his own rules. Which is apparent in the first mission. Whereas 47 in Hitman will actually take the time to plan and not be seen, this guy pretty much kills everything in the area to cover his tracks. So while you could probably kill the target without notifying the police of your whereabouts. You take a high-powered sniper rifle and take out about seven policemen as well as the target. Just in another day's work, right?   From there, the story begins with The Sniper getting caught by police and thrown in jail and drugged with something. You have to break out from prison to find out what you were drugged with, and the opportunity arises within the first five minutes as a gigantic riot of one breaks out. It was the saddest video game moment in recent memory when one inmate went berserk and attacked a stupid guard, flopping on top of him. All the rest of them just kinda sat around... so did I. I sat there waiting for something more to happen. Anything to happen. The other prisoners to wet themselves, or more guards to run into the room to see what happened, aliens to pour out of the walls, a song and dance, anything really. But alas, that sad little triggered event was it. And there sat the guard and the pathetic inmate lying dead on the ground with the guard's nightstick sitting there as well. ~Gee. I guess I'll get the nightstick and break out of the joint,~ I thought to myself. So I did. Suddenly I was in the middle of the most boring jailhouse riot ever, with only me and the guards participating. Just for the record, this prison had about 10 guards to every 1 prisoner. But they weren't prepared for me. Cause I'm a badass.   Anyway, this is pretty much how the rest of the game progresses. You run through stupid levels with blocky, chunky, and exceedingly boring design shooting anything that gets in your way. There are some more sad scripted events, although nothing so grand as that original jailhouse riot of one. You pretty much are on your ~Path of Vengeance~ and will not take no for an answer.   It's not exactly what I'd call a thinking man's shooter. To bring that point home, I'll point out the AI. Billy club weilding AI that runs right at a man with a shotgun and that continuously runs around a corner into the shot of a waiting killer. There were some points where the enemies ran behind a corner, but they'd be back in half a second to take a shot at you. There was no hiding in wait or teamwork trying to surround you. There were no guards hearing shots fired and coming to investigate. There was no free roaming through areas. All of the AI was cordoned off in certain portions of the playing field. So you never had to worry about guys actively coming to get you. Once you clear a room, you can take your damn time healing yourself and reloading all of your weapons even though you can hear all of the enemies feet shuffling like caged rats as they run back and forth in their little corner of the level trying to figure out how they can get at you.   But sometimes walls and doors don't stop them. When a guy runs straight through a wall or a door and starts firing at you, you'll be mighty surprised. Good thing most of these guys aren't really good shots.   The only thing I can really come close to giving props to is the skill system. The more you use certain weapons, the more accurate you become. The more you kill people, the more experience you get, allowing you to place skill points in each of these weapons categories, or into your health, stamina or strength rating. It's a nice attempt at something good, although it kinda falls flat because you still use the guns you need for certain situations without really thinking about the rating.   Aside from the lackluster AI and gameplay, the environments are also unworthy of note. Actually, they are worthy of note, because they're really not good. Textures aren't detailed, water looks like crap, models are chunky and awkward, animation is sub-par at best, color palette is anything but exciting, and architecture is clunky and uninteresting. Clipping problems occur with incredibly frequency. Blood splat textures sometimes hang in space as if there was some invisible wall holding them up. In fact, the only good thing I can say about this game visually is that some of the gun models and the hand holding the guns were actually competently done.   What I don't get is that it was supposed to be done with the Lithtech Jupiter engine. Well they certainly didn't make good use of it. Older Lithtech games look much better than this one does. No One Lives Forever, which put some creativity and detail into its design looked better than this. And this is the new Lithtech. Why does it suck? No One Lives Forever 2 didn't suck. Quite the contrary in fact.    What I find really amusing is that some of the characters in the game received the moving mouth treatment while others did not. Some characters talk to you through frozen lips, where others have the worst attempt at lip-synching I have ever seen. There was one girl in particular whose lips kept moving a good five seconds after the voice over had stopped.   Which brings us to the sad state of affairs in most of the sound in the game. Voice-overs were almost decent in some cases, but horribly cheesy and either over or under acted in most others. The main character just made me want to slap him with a Dirty Harry tape to knock some skills into him. Unfortunately, most characters in the game were just sitting there, waiting for you to come by with gun in had yelling ~You, stop!~ and ~Drop that weapon~ or even ~You're under arrest!~  Most weapon sounds were dulled as well giving me a kind of castrated feeling that comes with using an air rifle in a grenade fight. We won't even mention the music that had to have been composed by a first level music theory student at Pee Wee's Music College for the Ungifted. You would be hard pressed to find music as unsuited to a game like this if you tried. And the stuff that managed to come across as usable wasn't implemented well with tense beats and upturns happening when the action wasn't.Sniper: Path of Vengeance is a low budget, no fun, sad entry into the gaming world. Avoid it. Buy something like Half-Life or No One Lives Forever or even Deus Ex if you want RPG elements. But don't waste your money on this one.", "date": "Oct 22, 2002"}
