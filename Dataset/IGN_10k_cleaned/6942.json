Whether it's the nostalgic joys of Airfix Dogfighter, the pulpy antics of Crimson Skies, or the merciless realism of IL-2 Sturmovik, I just can't resist a game where you fly around shooting crap. Heck, sometimes I even find myself playing the ones where you don't shoot anything at all. It was no surprise then when Battle of Europe found its way onto my desk last week.   This arcade flyer, developed by Maus Software and published by Strategy First, lets players relive the carefree days in World War 2 when England's proud ~few~ mixed it up with Goering's Jerries. Players begin by repelling the German attacks from across the Channel. Over the course of ten missions (with six bonus missions offered as a reward to high scorers), players will eventually find themselves taking on bigger responsibilities, like stealing prototypes, escorting bombers, sinking battleships and even getting a shot at taking down Hitler himself.   Though the game suggests that it's for players of all levels, the arcade sensibilities make it less satisfying for veteran flight jockeys. Instead, it seems squarely aimed at those players who are interested in the subject matter but don't care about realistic flight models or complete historical accuracy. Loads of enemies and a nearly endless supply of bullets, rockets and bombs combine to create loads and loads of action but the lack of a bomb drift or a trajectory for the rockets and bullets make things a little too easy. If that weren't bad enough, the game includes an auto aim feature that helps your bullets track towards whatever target you're aiming at. At this point, the only real challenge is not colliding with another plane.  The game's physics system is barely adequate. Sure, there's no need for complex speed mechanics in a game like this but it would be nice, at the very least, if planes slowed down in a climb or sped up in a dive. Just as confusing is the game's insistence that a plane's agility is directly proportional to its speed. Slowing down virtually kills your maneuverability here. Again, I can happily accept relaxed physics but they at least have to work intuitively.  You won't find significant performance differences among the various fighters. Sure, the Typhoon is a little faster than the Spitfire and the Hurricane, but they all have the same agility, same durability and same capacity to carry weapons. Later on in the game you'll have the chance to experience some real differences when you have a chance to fly the jets -- the Shooting Star, Me 262 and Meteor -- and the B-17 bomber. Those planes have some markedly different flight characteristics than the prop-driven fighters and it adds a nice bit of variety to the game.  The missions themselves are fairly well designed, with a nice range of objectives. The tutorial walks you through the basics of flying, shooting, bombing, etc. and gets you ready for the real work at hand. Some of the more involved missions would have benefited from a checkpoint system to eliminate the tedious replays required by failures late in the mission. Still, there's usually a pretty clear focus to each mission which allows you to take care of business relatively quickly. I was a little frustrated that the game doesn't save your campaign progress until after you've proceeded to the next mission in the series. I actually had to replay a particularly difficult mission because of this oversight.   On the back of this game's box you'll find the following statement: ~3D graphics and astounding visual effects make this virtual battlefield almost too real.~ It's time marketers stopped this kind of thing. Sure, there are some good details on the planes -- the panels are well weathered and there are loads of cool emblems and insignia that keep the planes from looking generic -- but stating that the game looks ~almost too real~ is really going too far.  Explosion effects are generally good but you'll start to notice that they don't vary much. You'll see your enemies start to trail black smoke when you start damaging them. (It's a nice visual cue that makes the health bars above each plane seem kind of awkward and redundant.) When a plane is destroyed, it explodes in a satisfying black puff that sends pieces flying everywhere. Unfortunately almost all of the weapon effects are very generic. The one exception are the bright beams of purple light thrown up by the anti-air guns on the ground and on the decks of ships.  Environmental effects are generally good. Lighting is put to great use in the game, particularly at sunset and sunrise. Seeing the glare on the wings of your bombers as they fly to an enemy target really puts you in the moment. The contrails are also a nice touch but the effect is kind of ruined when they appear at treetop level.   The sound design leaves a bit to be desired. Engine and weapon sounds are just barely adequate and hardly communicate the weight and energy that they should. Adding a bit of punch to these effects would definitely encourage players to get their head in the game. The music is Tchaikovsky which suits the mood well but the quality of the recording is poor, leaving the score sounding thin and distant.There's definitely a fine line between arcade accessibility and accurate modeling. Even in an arcade game, a plane should fly like people who know nothing about aviation expect planes to fly. Things like torque and fuel mixture shouldn't matter, but things like gravity and speed should. Unfortunately, many of the things you'd expect to matter in an arcade flying game simply don't apply here.For twenty bucks, Battle of Europe might be worth the risk for players who are looking for something a little dumber and a lot easier than Secret Weapons or Blazing Angels.", "date": "May 31, 2006"}
