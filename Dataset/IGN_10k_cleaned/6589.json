The point about licensing the anti-consumerism source material has been belabored to death on the InterTron 8000. I'm here to talk to you about the mobile game and hopefully steer you away from it.   My disappointments stem from bland fighting mechanics and a few irritating bugs that marred the game play experience. The general set-up of the game is passable, with the player stepping into Jack's Dockers, hoping to free himself from his Ikea-powered numbness by getting the crap kicked out of him. You must work your way up through the ranks of the fight club until you reach a final showdown with Tyler Durden, who is spearheading Project Mayhem, something you may or may not want to stop, depending on your ideological leanings.   The fighting controls are simple, if not a little sloppy. You have a heavy high attack and a sweeping low attack. You can assign these moves to your choice of buttons -- which I liked. I found it easy to link them to 3 and 9, and that way I could use 2, 4, 6, and 8 to move around the arenas. You can try to beat the stuffing out of your opponents with these attacks, but to really get a lead, you need to knock them to the ground, jump on top of them, and then strike their face before they can push you off.   That's not a bad idea, but it's practically the only idea in Fight Club 3D. Matches quickly boil down to you smashing somebody to the ground, running across to them, and then landing a few blows before they get back up. The dance then starts all over again. I'm not expecting a fighting engine with the depth of, say, Street Fighter 3. But I definitely want more than a single-minded tactic that I use over and over to press through the fighters without much difficulty.   Now, about those bugs. On more than one occasion, I backed an opponent into a wall, only to somehow punch them right through it. I could see part of the arena off to the left side of the screen, while Jack and Fat Bob battled it out while hovering in inky darkness. (But with shadows beneath them, of course.) In a parking lot arena, I smashed one opponent into a wall, and then the action just sorta got stuck there. I could see arms and legs poking through the texture for the fence, but I was unable to move out of it. Unable to see, the computer beat me down and we started back in the middle of the arena. Things like that are annoying to see, especially when you don't have awesome game play to counter-balance them.   Fight Club 3D is not an unattractive game -- but nor is it close to come of its competitors on V CAST. The models are simplistic and covered with okay textures (Jack and Tyler are definitely recognizable), while fellow Space Monkey Fat Bob looked only kinda like Meat Loaf. The arenas are taken straight out of the movie, such as the parking garage and the diner parking lot where it all started. The game is flanked by some decent crunchy techno, and in the fight scenes, the music falls away in favor of some fist-against-face sound effects.  Fight Club 3D just isn't a very good game. The fighting mechanics are just too shallow, and we've now seen with Brady Bunch Kung Fu and Medieval Combat, that fun brawling is indeed possible on a cellphone. Couple the dull game play with some bugs, and I cannot reasonably recommend Fight Club to anybody, no matter how much of a Space Monkey they are.", "date": "Feb 3, 2006"}
