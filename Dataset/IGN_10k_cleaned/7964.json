The totally dopest, funky-freshiest, flavor-fillediest fly game of the Sega days is back. ToeJam & Earl has got it all  big gold chains, high-top sneakers, big pumpin' boomboxes and more. It's got a jammin' vibe, no doubt about that. But the hip beats of its play style seem a little outta whack now that the '90s have passed us by.   Originally a March release for the Genesis back in 1992, ToeJam & Earl told the tale of two totally tubular extraterrestrials. The duo of dudes come from the planet of funk  ToeJam's a three-legged, crimson-skinned string bean whose eyestalks rival the glory of any you've seen in the Mos Eisley cantina, and Earl's his rotund orange companion, a hungry hungry hippo of a man who's best left alone in the company of a well stocked hot dog stand. They've got to work together to save their butts from being stranded, as they've just crash-landed on Earth and fractured their spaceship into tons of tiny pieces.   Ten tiny pieces, that is, each of which can be found through brave overhead-view exploration of the game's many psychedelic environments. Officially these guys are walking around on planet Earth  but I don't recall ever seeing floating, flying islands hovering over Canada. It's definitely a weird scene, most likely a result of each level's random generation.    Like some dungeon-crawlers you may have played, the main mode of ToeJam & Earl spontaneously comes up with a unique level layout for each stage right when you arrive. You can play the game in a standard, fixed mode too  but the unpredictability of what things will be placed where adds to the fun of the experience.   Unfortunately, there's also a counterbalancing drain on the game's good times  its pace. Both aliens are lethargically slow, moving around each environment at a snail's pace. Grabbable, usable items can increase your character's speed, or provide ways to attack your enemies  but at the game's onset and throughout a large portion of the adventure, you simply control a guy whose only ability is to walk. Just walk. This game's listed as a member of the action genre, but slower action you'd be hard-pressed to find.   The overly casual pace can be a real turn-off if you're playing by yourself. ToeJam & Earl's real strength, then, is in its two-player co-op mode. Recruiting a friend to take simultaneous control of the other awesome alien adds a lot to the experience, and you don't have to start out playing two-player to begin with  they can jump in at any time. When both ToeJam and Earl are strutting their stuff, the game gets more dynamic.    Both characters can share a single screen and go on the quest together, or they can divide and conquer  when Players 1 and 2 move far enough away from each other in the game world, the display automatically switches to a split-screen mode. You can canvas each level in half the time by playing co-op efficiently, and even more interesting is that you and your partner don't even have to be on the same stage at the same time.   The game's visuals are a mixed bag. The intro sequence and interstitial cutscenes are appropriately funky and fun, but in-game the characters are small and not nearly as detailed. One thing you absolutely can't fault is TJ&E's sound design  the audio experience here really sells the entire package, fueled by radical tunes and thick, rich bass. If you find yourself sonically inspired you'll be able to jump into the game's included jam session mode and play accompaniment along with each of the game's background tracks.  ToeJam & Earl is definitely an alien experience  a collecting quest themed with the flavor of funk, primarily designed with two in mind. If you only have yourself to use as a game-playing partner, the single-player experience here will likely not hold your interest long. But if you've got a friend to play with you, there's fun to be found herein. ToeJam and Earl  kickin' it out old-school, yo.", "date": "Jan 24, 2007"}
