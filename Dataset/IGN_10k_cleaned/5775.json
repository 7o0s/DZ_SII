Standing in line for tickets may not have been necessary, as Reaxion loaded up BREW handsets with a mobile footballer based on the sports flick. The Longest Yard, as expected, is an over-the-top arcade-style pigskin contest. But beneath the hard hits and breakaway touchdowns, The Longest Yard offers some depth that surprises.   The Longest Yard pits a team of jarheaded inmates against the guards. The basics of football are in place, complete with the necessity of making downs, two-point conversions, and a playbook overflowing with defensive and offensive options. But The Longest Yard strips away a few players per team to streamline the game play. It's a good choice for this kind of game -- it keeps the action fast and frantic, even if it does limit a few strategic options.   When you start the game, you can easily hop into a simple pick-up-and-play match, but if you opt to play a full season -- en route to the warden's final challenge -- you will discover The Longest Yard's unsuspected sim trappings. You can choose/buy players for your team and assign them to different positions. The players have specific demeanors, too. For example, an aggressive players is likely best as a linebacker. You'd rather have your QB calm and collected, thus less likely to make bad decisions.   The can also equip your team of convicts with gear like spiked helmets and spiked boots that will help pulverize the guards. This gear costs, but since you get funds for every game you win, the investment is worth it. You can also employ ~dirty tricks~ to affect the game, like calling for a lawyer. It's silly, but definitely appropriate for this tongue-in-cheek footballer.   The Longest Yard is somewhat held back by its controls. On the LG VX8000 version we tested, it was sometimes a real trick to get the ball down the field. If your finger slips away from pressing directly up, rather than have the player start running diagonally, he immediately makes a hard right and you sacrifice yardage. This kind of mishap happens too frequently.   On the plus side, though, The Longest Yard is a rather attractive game. The players are nicely drawn and animated. And when the make (and attempt to make) plays, little words pop over their heads to clue you into the results. ~Oops!~ signals that a play was botched. However, if you successfully stiff-arm a guard, you see a little ~Hit!~ It should also be noted that none of the actors from the movie appear in the game, either -- but that doesn't help nor hurt The Longest Yard.  The Longest Yard is a pretty solid arcade-style football game with some surprising sim trimmings, even if they are a little goofy. I wish the control was a little better -- I hated giving up yardage when I tired to get around a defender or if my finger slipped off the thumbpad even a little. However, if you liked those fantasy football games from the Genesis/SNES days like Mutant League, you may enjoy The Longest Yard.", "date": "May 31, 2005"}
