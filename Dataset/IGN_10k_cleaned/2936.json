{"name": "Summoner 2", "name_review": "Summoner 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/17/summoner-2", "text": "Known best for its stellar first-person shooter series Red Faction, Volition Inc. continues to be one of the most consistent developers in the business. Each project out, the Illinois-based programming house improves on whatever genre it's tackling with a fresh approach, strong attention to glitch control, and some of the best visuals on the platform of its choice. Whether it's the aforementioned Red Faction or the stellar PC space battle Freespace, quality is a trait that Volition has plenty of. Yet the team will be the first to admit that there's always room for improvement.   Such was the case with the company's PlayStation 2 launch RPG, Summoner. Over hyped and text-heavy, the moderately selling first attempt managed to grab itself a sporadic following from casual adventurers, but not the recognition from the hardcore market that it so desperately needed. Not without its share of problems (like the nagging inter-level loads and draw-in issues), the original Summoner was a solid enough Role-Playing game to warrant a sequel for not only fans of the initial jaunt, but also to fix the problems that bothered so many nitpickers.   Which brings us to the return piece, Summoner 2. Bigger, smoother, and visually improved, the newest notch in the Volition belt is exactly what the developers set out to achieve. Still a little rough around the edges, the final product joins the Godfather, Part 2 and Empire Strikes Back as one of the few sequels that surpasses the original.    Story  It would be a futile attempt at storytelling to even try and explain the vastly complex plot in the confines of single review. Easily one of the busiest character pieces in the history of the genre, the formidable monster is once again a text-heavy exercise in literacy that may daunt straightforward action hounds until the ends of time; Or at least until the end of the Bush administration.   That said, Summoner 2 is the tale of a nubile young queen named Maia. Heralded all over the kingdom of Halassar as ~the goddess Laharah reborn~, you have already been coined as the savior of all creation. Or at least, that's what the Book of Prophets says. Alas, the King of King of Galdyr is after young Maia's head, and intends to get it by invading the kingdom's borders and taking the land for his own. After a betrayal by your own people who are in cahoots with the evil king and several flashbacks later, the game begins on the high seas with an invasion by pirates on the queen's personal ship. From there it gets super complicated and is best left as an experience rather than a written communication.   Gameplay  As complicated as the story may be, the game itself isn't all that hard to grab hold of. Moving beyond the semi-real time battle system we found in the original Summoner, the sequel is now entirely on the fly. Turn-based only when selecting items and magic spells to be readied for hot keys, the flow of battle is far smoother than we saw before. Healing, attacking, and every other aspect of warfare that we experienced in the initial offering is much easier and intuitive than before, but also asks for more attentiveness as everything happens unstopped. A few seconds of feigned interest and you're dead meat.   Also like the first title, Summoner 2 allows you to take control of one of your three party members without a single repose. So while Maia may be the main antagonist, a quick flip of the R2 shoulder button will move the reigns over to blue spellcaster Morbazan or perhaps android smooth talker Iari. Imperative when facing some bosses and interacting with certain characters, it's a great touch and clever design choice to break up the monotony of playing as just one character. A welcome addition in the Super NES cart Secret of Mana all those years ago, this turn from traditionalism is a wise one.   Cool as that feature may be, the scripted A.I. for your supporters isn't all that wise. While it's certainly a step above the mindless drone-like response from your buddies in Kingdom Hearts (which uses a similar supporting character system), the choices you select are often too extreme. What this means is, if you want one of your characters to be a healer, they will do very little by way of anything other than healing the nearby wounded. Sometimes forgoing completely the fact that they're getting a giant axe smashed into their skull. While it's perfectly fine to have a tendency or even a primary function, basic self-defense would have been a good idea, regardless of what kind of A.I. script you've chosen for your pals. Granted it's in there on a limited scale, but not enough to make much of a difference when applied in every day battle.   Character A.I. from an enemy standpoint fares much better, as the intelligent CPU-controlled baddies know when to heal themselves and when to attack. And once you've made it past the first few hours of gameplay, you can only expect them to get faster, tougher, and more merciless. A fan of how hard the game is (a must for RPG-savvy veterans), I was glad to see that experience points weren't the only factor that determined your success; your effectiveness as a warrior on a personal level was a big part of it too.   Not if you use your summons however. Incredibly powerful and able to mow down anything that gets in their way, the four evolving summons and final all-powerful creature at your disposal can do away with even the most ferocious of enemies. With the exception of boss characters, calling upon ~Blood~, ~Tree~, ~Sand~, or ~Eye~ is bona fide success. And with three stronger forms for each of the spirits you control, your deities become even more relentless as time goes on. To counter this, the game limits the amount of time you can host the summoned form, and with a maximum of only a few minutes before needing to recover, you have to choose the appropriate time to call upon them or you could end up down the creek without a paddle.   I just wish that the summons themselves served a more diverse purpose than what's given to us. While Eye is great for long-range tactics and Tree and Sand can hold their own with melees, none of the super characters hold any special purposes. In all truth, you could just summon blood over and over again through any of his three forms and be just as effective with him alone than with any of the other spirits in tandem. While there are some summon-specific events and what not spread throughout the 50 hours worth of game, there should have been more obvious reasons to choose whom you select.   I can overlook all that though, because this time around (despite how absolutely gigantic this game truly is), the nagging load times and sporadic gameplay hitches that provided such critic-fodder in the original have been mysteriously whisked away. Thank you Volition, you have listened to our prayers!   Graphics  There were but two main complaints from players of Summoner in the visuals department; Poor character models and a tanker load of draw-in. For the most part, those problems have been fixed, as the polygon people are nicely rendered and have a lot more detail than the first game did. Similarly, draw-in is a thing of the past and instances where you can see the mountains taking shape in the distance as you approach them are few and far between. Volition has done an excellent job of addressing those issues and should be commended.   On the flipside however, the new graphical detail hasn't helped the framerate much. Topping off at perhaps 30 frames per second, the choppy camera rotation stuttered a bit too much for my liking. Light sourcing also appears to be an afterthought, as magical spells and hue changes have little to no affect on characters or objects within them. Finally, there are some spots in certain environments where textures mysteriously swap places as you walk over them and invisible lines break up character detail in certain poses.   Most of these complaints are minor however, as the hyper charged colors and strangely designed worlds are reminiscent of a 3D Myst and offer some of the best anti-aliasing on the PlayStation 2 so far. The character designs and summons too are artistically commendable, with plenty of diversity and strange crayon-inspired schemes. If only the character animations matched their design   Sound  I enjoyed the score quite a bit, but can't help but still prefer the original game's just a tad. With more of a Middle Eastern flare than previously, the string-heavy orchestral accompaniment is about what you'd expect from an RPG of this level, and represents itself well in the echelon of PlayStation 2 genre champions.   Vocally is where the audio truly stands out. Already a performer in Summoner, the sequel sees a high volume of characters speaking to one another in perfectly sampled and superbly acted sessions and has that British stage play feel with nearly every interaction. The Unseen voices in particular caught my attention, and I enjoyed speaking with them over and over again just to show my friends how cool they could be.   Sound effects and ambiance isn't quite on the same level as the vocals and musical precession though, and much like the first game, could have used a lot more variety and quality over the basic samples used to illustrate swords, weapons, and the like.I found myself quite surprised with how much I enjoyed Summoner 2. Admittedly aimed at the more action-oriented crowd than say, Final Fantasy or Suikoden, Volition's follow-up says a lot for the company's ability to take criticism well and improve things where it must.Incredibly large (even by RPG standards), this game is packed with gaping quests, enthralling side stories, and a complex backbone the likes of which are rarely seen. Though it lacks the polish, balance, and personality of Squaresoft's same-day release Kingdom Hearts, Summoner 2 is still a more than acceptable alternative for the older sect of adventurers. Good stuff.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
