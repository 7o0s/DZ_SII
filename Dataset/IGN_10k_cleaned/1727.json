{"name": "Riddle of the Sphinx", "name_review": "Riddle of the Sphinx", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/20/riddle-of-the-sphinx", "text": "In their newest product, self-styled adventure connoisseur collective Dreamcatcher Interactive favors a style of conundrum we haven't as yet catalogued: the obscure breed.  Specifically, while solving puzzles in the rather mundane Riddle of the Sphinx isn't necessarily a tedious chore, finding them in the first place is more than half the battle.  Insightful at times, playful during other moments, Omni Creative Group's labor of love is part edu-ware, part Myst disciple.  Luckily, what with the historically inspired, neo-futuristic fictional account of a background story this sucker sports, it can at least pass for a game.  Players are cast as the friend of an archaeologist who's recently uncovered a secret passage leading under the Sphinx, but thereafter went missing and is presumed dead.  Upon receiving a hastily scribbled call for help from your old chum, it's off to Egypt where Indiana Jones fans go in search of sun, sand and riches galore.  As for that missing friend, well... the less detective work you do, the more 1000 year old emerald and ruby studded bedpans there are to go around.  Operating under a classic panoramic point n' click interface, one uses an icon dependent cursor when performing all actions such as movement or examination.  Said control method, along with a 'WARP' feature that quickly moves the main character around previously explored environments, is surprisingly ergonomic and responsive.  Of course such performance perks come at the cost of visual splendor, seeing as how the game's pixilated and archaic vistas offend the peepers, but who's counting?  The heart and soul of a brainwave intensive product rests within its interactive challenges, and Riddle of the Sphinx puts forth a concerted effort in this regard.  That extra effort was expended on creating a painless - if outdated - control system is commendable.  But for some minor issues with turning sideways (impossible unless in a 360 degree scene) and a crusty lookin' main menu, all's well on this front.  Pity the same can't be said for the level architecture.  Riddle of the Sphinx subscribes to that old, misdirected design theory, which states, ~give 'em plenty of things to see and do, but provide zero guidance.~ Though the puzzles and in-game locales are interesting, uncovering the steps through which certain obstacles are removed is a task worthy of an idiot savant.  Having encountered a particular stumper, solutions generally seem obvious, but you're usually left clueless on how to proceed towards these goals.  Many mindbenders can be surmounted through the use of acquired objects.  Locating these items is quite a pain in the rump, however, since several blend in with useless background fluff.  Your biggest dilemma is navigating the mazelike series of rooms and corridors that contain the needed constructs or obscure bits of information.  Overlook some seemingly minor detail and it's a passport to frustration city.  Somehow the experience remains oddly compelling regardless.  Part of this attraction rests on the title's attention to detail.  Items must be employed in a logical manner, for instance.  A tape deck can't be used until the eject button is pressed and a cassette inserted.  Light won't flood a hallway unless you've first supplied power to an electrical generator.  Information you need that could only be possessed by someone familiar with the dig is found in lengthy journal entries and detailed manuscripts.  Despite forcing a few extreme constraints on the player as a result, the increased sense of believability justifies the hit.  Decor-wise the game adopts a comparative stance.  Various locales were reproduced with an eye for realism and simply drip with ancient cultural mystique.  Too bad they look like low-res poo when running in full screen mode, however.  Intelligent adventurers will stick with the more inhibited windowed view, even if it detracts from the overall experience.  Regarding the sound effects one hears while exploring crumbling tombs, ancient stone galleries, and cramped crawlspaces... they're there, which is the most complimentary thing a reviewer can say.  Should presentation factor into your purchase decision, take a little consolation in the fact that the hieroglyphic-plastered underground rooms, which host most of the tale feature fascinating relics and artwork from a bygone era.  Which is, presumably, the same epoch the title's conceptual foundations hail from.  Five holiday seasons ago, it might've emerged as a cult favorite.  Nowadays, Riddle of the Sphinx is just another in a long line of generic, primitive adventure game clones that garners even less attention than those 'earth shattering' announcements concerning the artist formerly known as Prince.  On the bright side, Dreamcatcher's latest has more meaty content and educational value to fall back on when the going gets rough than most packages out there.  If only they'd chucked in an online hint guide, reworked the graphics or considered that not everyone's a Rain Man, it would've casually risen above the riff-raff.  Call in the gravediggers... looks like the Mummy's curse has struck again.  -- Scott Steinberg Want to share your opinions with the world?
