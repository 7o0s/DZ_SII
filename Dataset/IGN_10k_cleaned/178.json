Things such as graphics that always count heavily on other types of games don1t matter nearly as much as the 3fun2 factor. That is, does it grab hold of your mind and hold you captive in front of your TV? Zoop has all the makings of a good puzzle game, it just doesn1t deliver the goods.  Basically, you point your shape at the oncoming shapes and shoot them. If your color matches its color, it will disappear. If the colors don1t match, you exchange colors with that piece. Even if you shoot through one matching piece, the one behind it can change you. That1s it.  Zoop is fun at first, but soon grows tiresome when you realize nothing else is going to happen. At least games like Tetris and Bust-A-Move have head-to-head options, which provide some much needed change of pace. If you1re a die hard puzzle fan, Zoop will probably provide you with some amusement. But for the casual puzzler, stick to Tetris.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
