We'll leave the review of the movie to the critics who are already having a field day with it, but the game is a surprisingly competent action title with lots of Devil May Cry elements. There are lots of monsters to hunt, tons of secret items, and horrible camera angles to muck it up, but it's a fairly fun outing. The big problem is that after the initial burst of going through the game once there's little to hold your interest.    Gameplay  Over the course of the game, Van Helsing hunts the elusive Dracula and comes across the Wolf Man, Frankenstein, Igor, and Mr. Hyde along the way as well as hundreds of other enemies. The action for the game focuses on near-constant fighting with either a projectile weapon or one of two handheld blades. Starting out, the man Van has his trusty pair of pistols and spinning hand blades that can rip through flesh. This will change as Van Helsing moves on up to the chaingun and a pair of swords. Most of the weapons have a more powerful form that can be used for a short time. The projectile weapons get stronger projectiles and the blades get an elemental property like fire or ice.   In addition to the weapons, Van Helsing will also acquire bonus skills and extra amounts of life and special ammunition. Doing this requires picking up lots and lots and lots of glyphs, glowing green crosses that spill from the bodies of the enemies and various inanimate objects that are scattered throughout the levels like crates and other boxes. After killing a boss character, you can go into the armory to purchase the new skills or items that will refill the health or ammunition in the regular game.    With all of these weapons, what makes Van Helsing fun is that the constant action of fighting lots of monsters in the Transylvanian setting. With the movie license, the game does indeed look good and has the official storyline to integrate into the gameplay. There are also a lot of different creatures that have different fighting styles to deal with and keep the game moving and moving until the very end when, well, somebody dies. We have to keep a few secrets for those who want to see the movie.   Van Helsing cribs the leveling up and the cameras from Devil May Cry and even some of the styles of the moves. There's a double-jump and there's the possibility of shooting while in mid-air or launching a creature into the air and jumping at the same time for in-flight carnage. While these moves look cool and add some style to the game, there's a lack of depth in the combos and moves that made Devil May Cry so fun to play and dig into. The main skill that needs to be mastered is the art of the dodge. By constantly firing and somersaulting around the levels, players will be able to clear 99% of the game.    The 1% that is different from the regular pattern involves a couple of bosses and a few enemies that require a little more finesse, but there is plenty of time that is spent doing the dodge and shoot. Too many times there are scenarios that involve slow-moving enemies in large open areas where all you need to do is constantly fire and target the creatures, occasionally moving around to avoid the few who get close. When players want to collect lots of glyphs to upgrade, these areas are perfect, but they're a bit of a joke otherwise.   After finishing the game on the normal difficulty setting, the hard mode opens up, but there's little reason to even bother. Van Helsing starts the hard difficulty with all of the weapons from the normal mode and with a chaingun in tow it's easy to mow through all the creatures. Instead of making all the monsters harder to kill, the hard difficulty throws in more difficult monsters in various locations instead of the normal ones.    This may sound like a minor point, but these are the same monsters that became easy to kill once the chaingun gets opened up in the first place. Since many sections don't even require all of the monsters in the area to be killed to go on and all the skills have been bought up, most of hard mode involves running past all the monsters to get to the bosses who are set at the same difficulty level. The only bonus is that a few new areas can be opened up with the new skills and weapons, but the result is usually a new cheat that allows for something useless like Big Head mode.     So even though there's some arcade-style fun with the first trip through the game, the replayability is pretty minimal. With everything pretty much unlocked the first time through, the thrill of battle quickly fades away. There are a few challenges that will yield some extra cheats, but for the most part the second time through quickly reveals itself to be pretty pointless. For a game that can be beat the first time through in five hours, this is a sad end to a mostly enjoyable title.   Camera  The camera provides plenty of drama in two flavors: Dramatic Flourish and Insufferable Bastard. The camera does not move around with the character and instead each location has a set number of possible camera locations. As Van Helsing moves closer to one camera location, the camera will switch or quickly move from one to the other. The advantage is pretty clear as it shows off the environments to their fullest potential and makes everything all purty.   The downside to this is the Insufferable Bastard part of it. With a limited number of camera locations there are problems that pop up as Van Helsing moves far away from the nearest possible camera and will become teeny-tiny or disappear behind an object or get zoomed in on so that the depth of field drops to wafer thin. In one scene, Van Helsing enters a tunnel and starts out very close to the camera. As he moves down the tunnel the camera follows him and zooms in on him to keep him the right size.    The problem is that this tunnel is a couple hundred feet long and filled with enemies. In this zoomed-in state, the image becomes flat and it makes any maneuvering around the enemies impossible. The only option is to skip the whole thing altogether and run past everyone to a better camera location.   The other tricky situations are the boss battles that are handled in a similarly rough manner with sometimes only one camera location that looks down on the action from very far away. This can lead to plenty of situations where it's hard to make out what's going on and do any movement around the bosses. Other times there will be multiple camera locations, but since they focus on Van Helsing, the bosses can disappear from the field of view. Many boss fights rely heavily on the targeting feature and constantly moving to avoid the unseen attacks.    Graphics  With a movie to help out, the art style has been set at a high level with plenty of licensed art and characters from the cinematic version. There are lots of different monsters of different shapes and sizes for variety and sufficiently creepy surroundings for them to populate. With so many tall and distorted buildings and 19th century Transylvanian charm to go around, the setting is perfect for the action.   The framerate generally holds solid, but there are definitely moments of sheer chugginess that clog up the screen with massive slowdown. Oddly enough, these situations happen in locations that don't appear to be too graphically intense such as small rooms with the camera somewhat zoomed in. Still, for the most part, it holds up.   Sound  As with the graphics, the sound quality is held up by the film connection with some of the same voices as the movie and professionally done music. The soundtrack provides a good backdrop and provides some atmosphere to complement the graphical style. The sound effects bring up the action with satisfying whumps and thuds.As a game that's licensed from a movie, Van Helsing manages to do a capable job of providing lots of monsters to kill and enables players to live out some Transylvanian kicks by re-enacting movie moments, but there's still a lot missing. The camera needs work and after picking up the more powerful weapons the monsters become too easy, too quickly. While this is forgivable for most of the game, the boss fights become truly aggravating.Playing through the game one time is a fun diversion for an afternoon, especially if you're down with the old-school monsters, but there's not enough gameplay to outlast the first time through. If anything, Van Helsing would be best experienced as a rental so that by the time you realize that there's nothing left, it's time to bring it back.", "date": "May 7, 2004"}
