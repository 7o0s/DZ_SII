The Super NES Jedi adventures protected all civilians young and small from bouts of boredom. Then the LucasArts empire went dark, and the power of the Force faded in a period of great suffering. Even the mighty Yoda himself could not stop the fall into darkness. But there is destined to be a new hope...    Features:  Use the Force to power your way through nine treacherous levels  Wield the Jedi lightsaber, a blaster pistol, or take control of the Force to fight enemies Hi-Color stills from the movie Only for Game Boy Color    After HotGen's incredible Road Champs BXS Stunt Biking, hopes were high that their take on the Star Wars universe would vanquish the darkness with epic gameplay and dazzling adventure. But it was not to be. Obi-Wan has much to learn about the ways of the videogame.  Much like reviled Jedi Power Battles, the action in this game is a clumsy kind of urgent fight through phalanxes of Battle Droids. Never before has the  lightsaber been so tested in battle, as every blaster shot can be deflected back at enemies as Obi-Wan charges in to vanquish is foe. That was one of the few great aspects of Jedi Power Battles, and though the Game Boy version is not based on that game, it shares the precision sword swinging and chaotic battle action.  However, Obi-Wan is not at all of its senses despite the enjoyable swordsmanship. At a distance, the lightsaber works amazingly as a deflective weapon, but once the jedi tries to use the sword's real purpose in up-close combat, the saber betrays itself with a shortened swing and inept control. Battling the lethal rolling Destroyer Droids is a chore because it's difficult to make a clean cut when the controls have a tough time staying to face the droid. There are other limited weaponry in Obi-Wan's arsenal, but the main weapon of a Jedi is unwieldy.  Star Wars: Obi-Wan's Adventures also has rough, sluggish controls unbefitting of a masterful Jedi Knight. This is one of those games where your fingers begin to hurt after some time playing because you can't convince your psyche not to think that the character shouldn't be moving faster. And for some reason, no Star Wars Episode I adventure has had good control over the character's jumps -- the Jedi are completely flatfooted in their spring. Here, Obi-Wan hardly leaves the ground in a leap (except when bounding off a jump plate, which are rare), making platform hopping a brutal task. The control over the character is constantly at odds with the action, and weaving through electrified floor plates or leaping over boggy streams is overwhelming.  Visuals are indeed wonderfully animated, but are on such a small scale that the effort is sometimes futile. At times the tiny, drab Obi-Wan figure on the screen looks mercilessly pitiful despite the crisp motion and detail. At other times, however, watching the amazing Destroyer Droids roll out and unfurl themselves in a hail of laser blasts is indeed impressive. The game's solid engine also allows many enemies to be on-screen at a time, so the feeling of being surrounded by unpitying droids like in the film is well captured in the action.  But ultimately, the bleak and colorless flat environments overcome the visual appeal. The entire first two stages feature blank backgrounds standing awkwardly from the battlefield in an isometric view reminiscent of Zaxxon. The graphics recover slightly with the forest stages and sharp Naboo palace, but even then, the color scheme is so pale and dimensionless that doors and other important landmarks fade into the background.  The let-down in graphics is at least tempered by a phenomenal amount of detail in the backgrounds. Non-interactive details such as computers droning on against the walls, fans swinging in the ceiling, pistons cranking energy, turrets slowly scanning the horizon, bunkers abandoned on the Naboo floor, and moss cascading from the palace precipices all lend to the authenticity of the Star Wars environment. The visuals also assist in solving some of the game's cryptic puzzles, leading players to the solution with inset indicators that are not just arrows or flashing signals, but organic parts of the environment that also happen to be the solution to the problem.   Also of note is the brilliant sound design -- a standard in LucasArts titles on consoles, but still far and away above what would be expected on the Game Boy Color. Duel of the Fates is faithfully rendered in simple tones, but much more impressively is the detail work in the sound. There are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth -- cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy. There are also environment noises that you rarely hear on the little handheld -- approach a fan blade, and you can hear it's murmur; retreat down the hall and the sound will disappear. Nobody puts that kind of concentrated effort into sound on the Game Boy Color. Nobody.  The power of the dark side has overcome this Star Wars adventure, and though Obi-Wan puts up a brave fight with tremendous swordsmanship and intelligent puzzle design, the dark side remains. Murky visuals and slothful control destroy any hope of greatness in this game. This day, evil has won. However, the level of detail in the sound and the lost detailing in the graphics speak of an effort well conceived even in its death. With the advent of the Game Boy Color and the promise of a new day, we're hoping that the future of LucasArts' handheld adventures may still hold promise. This battle is a loss, but there will be another.", "date": "Dec 22, 2000"}
