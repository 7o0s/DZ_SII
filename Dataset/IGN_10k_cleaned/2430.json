The game was originally released in German and then was translated to English.  While nothing innovative, Gothic does offer a solid storyline, attractive graphics and an excellent role-playing experience.  Role-playing fans looking for that new game with a good story should look no further.  In the kingdom of Myrtana, war has been raging for many years.  Enemy after enemy is driven back and defeated.  Only one foe remains, the Orcs.  After so many years of battle, however, the kingdom is short of both men and weapons.  One special mine contains a magical ore that can craft unbreakable weapons.  In order to mine this ore, prisoners are sent to the mining colony.  Each person convicted of a crime, no matter what the crime is, is sent to the colony for the king.  The conditions were very poor and many prisoners attempted escape.  In order to prevent this from continuing, the king sent his most powerful mages to construct a barrier to allow new prisoners in but let none out.    Something went horribly wrong, though, and the mages along with a much larger area that expected, were trapped underneath the new barrier.  The prisoners took advantage of the surprise of the guards and seized control.  The king needed his magical ore so he was forced to negotiate with the prisoners now in control of the mining colony.  In exchange for anything the prisoners desired, the king would receive his ore.  Also, newly convicted criminals continued to be sent into the mining colony.  The player takes on the role of a newly convicted, unnamed prisoner who is being sent through the barrier.  He is asked to take a letter to the head of the fire mages in the old camp.  After agreeing and pushed through the barrier, he falls into a small body of water and drags himself to land.  His first encounter is with a group of bullies who punch him and he falls unconscious.  Upon awakening, the player is greeted by a man, who reveals himself to be Diego.  Diego is a guide of sorts and he describes the old camp in detail and suggests that the player visit the old camp to further talk with him.  After giving the introductory information, Diego starts heading towards the old camp.  Players can follow him for safety sake, as there are some monsters on the road and at the start, the character is very weak.  There are three different camps which players can join, the old camp, the new camp and the sect camp.  The old camp is headed by Gomez, the Ore Baron.  It is the camp that made the agreement with the King to exchange ore for supplies.  Members of the new camp are working with a group of the mages trapped in the barrier to try and break through it.  The sect camp is putting all its' faith in ~The Sleeper~, a god who they believe will free them from the barrier.  There is no character creation.  All players start out with the same appearance and starting statistics.  The character is developed as it progresses through the game.  There are two basic attributes, strength and dexterity, which affect skills.  Weapon skills range from one-handed and two-handed weapons to bows and crossbows.  There are several levels of magic, called circles, and players can learn spells in a variety of schools, from fire magic to necromancy.  The game has a hunting skills system as well, allowing ore, the currency of Gothic, to be earned by skinning the hides and removing the teeth from a variety of animals.  Each time the character levels, which happens when enough experience points have been earned, 10 skill points and a life bonus is are awarded.  Skill points, along with an amount of ore, are needed to purchase the skills and develop the character.  A player can train in any range of skills or specialize in a certain type of character.  Experience points can be gained by completing quests.  There are a large variety of quests in each of the camps, some of which are required to progress the storyline and others that are just to make additional ore.  Quests range from obtaining items or finding a person to completing delivery or sale of something.  In one, a guard has disappeared and two people ask you to find this guard.  It turns out the guard, Nek, is dead.  His body is being guarded by three molerats that must be killed.  Nek's body holds an amulet that will prove his death.  The other way to gain experience points is through combat.  In the wilderness are a variety of monsters which, when killed, yield loot and experience points.  If a player strikes out too early and tries to kill some monsters, they will meet a quick death.  Death in Gothic is permanent, so it is necessary to save often.  Battles with non-player characters will normally result in being knocked out and looted, but a player will not normally be killed.  However, the monsters have no qualms and will kill the player.  The primary storyline revolves around gaining respect in the different camps and eventually choosing a camp to join.  Interaction with non-player characters is a critical part of this game.  There are numerous choices to dialogue and the choices a player makes can affect attitude and limit later opportunities.  Also, all non-player characters can be attacked and killed, making it possible to remove characters permanently from a game.    Moving around in the game is quite simple, but interacting with the environment takes some getting used to.  A combination of keys is necessary to pick up items, talk to characters, attack, jump and climb.  Combat involves repeatedly hitting the action key and the arrow keys.  This can become burdensome and it would have been nice if the interface were made friendlier.  However, after some time playing this game, the awkward interface fades to the background and becomes almost unnoticeable.  The graphics are pretty decent for a game of this magnitude.  The world is quite large and very detailed.  Night is very dark and storms are believable.  Many times during the game it is suggested that the player find someplace to sleep through the night.  The buildings and characters are very detailed.  Non-player characters have very expressive facial expressions, something that is often missed in games of this nature.  The graphics run pretty smoothly for the most part.  The sound is equally adequate.  Voice acting is decent and sound effects are appropriate.  Overall, Gothic is a solid role-playing experience.  Gothic has decent graphics and a well-developed storyline.  It also has a great amount of replayability, as each time through the game could yield different experiences with different choices.  The awkward interface does not detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.  This game would please any role-playing fans looking for a great story to involve them for some time.  -- Staci Krause Want to share your opinions with the world?
