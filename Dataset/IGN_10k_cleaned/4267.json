However, until now, golf has only been available via the antics of Simon and Schuster's madcap Outlaw Golf franchise and EA's Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Microsoft's Links franchise has existed longer than the two combined, practically. On the PC it was the premiere, year-on-year answer to playing the world's top courses and testing your skills without having to pay the green fees.   The arrival of Links 2004 on Xbox was immanent. Not only does it fulfill the need for an exclusive first-party golf title from Microsoft, but it also widens XSN and Xbox Live support; the latter has  been sorely lacking from the Xbox library, as EA did not make Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 available online for any platforms other than PS2 and PC.   The age-old franchise has gotten a makeover, and fully transitions into 3D with all the accessories of a console title. Most notably it brings solid online play to deprived Xbox Live gamers in addition to intuitive, flexible gameplay. But this isn't quite Links how fans of the franchise have come to know it. Like an old man shopping for a hip new wardrobe, its attempts to become cooler are glaring. This makes it more of an ~everyone~ title, instead of being the pro golf simulation it has focused on being in the past. This is both good and bad, depending on what you're looking for.   Gameplay  Links 2004 is a definite departure from the gameplay style it created on the PC. Once the standard for simulation golfers, the franchise doesn't try to keep its old ways, but instead happily conforms to be console-friendly with a more approachable and decidedly hipper style. Ironically, where the franchise once no doubt inspired EA's Tiger Woods, it seems to be just the opposite with Links on Xbox. It encourages more easy going golf.    The series has made the leap into 3D and adopted the real-time analog swing that the aforementioned Tiger series has made popular. With no need for a mouse, gone is the three-click swing method or any option for it. Links 2003 on the PC actually offered this, but it was handled differently. Taking a swing with the left analog stick is simplified and dumbed down. For a series that once proclaimed to be the best golf simulation, it is anything but that now. Requirements for precision swings are mostly gone. It's very easy to hit the ball straight, which minimizes the skill of actually swinging and focuses more on club choice and the power you put behind it.     It uses a simple power meter that fills as you pull the analog stick back; when you swing forward the power of the shot is decided and the straightness of your analog swing is measured. It doesn't take much skill to use, though. It's very hard to hit an errant shot unless you've chosen the wrong club or underestimated wind conditions. This all ties into game difficulty mode you choose: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced; Beginner is for absolute amateurs at golfing games, Intermediate is probably the best mode for most Links 2004 beginners to try out; and, Advanced is meant for those that have become accustomed to the game's swing style. The differences are more visual than they are mechanically driven. Meaning, as you move from Beginner to Intermediate you lose the ~recommended~ power line, which gives you an approximation of where you should stop your swing to end up on the lie you desire, swing difficulty is minimally increased. Wind also has a slight effect on the ball. In other words, you have to be extremely inexperienced to feel challenged in Beginner mode. From Intermediate to Advanced the changes are more drastic. The power line is long gone and so is the meter -- only you eyeing where the club is on your backswing will give you an indication of the power you're putting behind it. Wind also takes more of a toll on the ball flight and putting is much more difficult. So, while three settings of difficulty are appreciated, there just isn't enough flexibility to make advanced feel truly different than beginner. Sure, you're more likely to slice the ball now and then, but it's still pretty easy to keep it on the fairway. You also can't change the game difficulty once you've created a career profile, which we take major issue with.    Putting tends to be stiff. The developers seem to have crafted the power meter and tied the physics right into it. Whether you're on Beginner or Advanced, putting is always rigid. The only changes are visual, just like the fairway play. You have a blue line that gives you a read on the break of the ball path; this only shortens once you choose advanced. You also lose the power meter completely. Seemingly this would improve the simulation element of putting, but the analog swing of the putter still behaves exactly as it would if you were reading the meter. It feels awkward because the club sluggishly responds to your will to pull it back. It keeps to a slower, more forgiving style and many of the greens feel slow because of this.    So, while the analog swinging isn't completely satisfying, none of this breaks the game or makes it less playable. It's pretty intuitive and is very useful for amateur golfers (of the videogame variety, that is). Indeed, it is a golfing game that ~everybody~ can play with a little practice.   It delivers an average amount of courses for play. There are nine professional courses, a modest number, but many of them won't be interesting to the audience Links 2004 tries to cater to. Pebble Beach, Royal Birkdale, Gleneagles, and Wailea calibur courses are mostly gone. St. Andrews is here, thankfully, but you have to unlock it first -- even for multiplayer -- just like the other four of the nine courses. The full list includes Four Seasons Resort Aviara, Greywolf, Mauna Lani Resort, Superstition Mountain, New South Wales, Oakmont CC, Loch Lomond, St. Andrews, and Ocean Mill. For the amateur golf crowd Links 2004 caters to, it's another clash in style.      In other areas too, Links 2004 only delivers in moderation. The Career mode unfolds over a series of tour levels, Rookie, Pro, Champion, and so on. Within each level of increased AI competition you will face skill challenges, such as Par 3 challenges and closest-to-the-pin competitions. Over each game you are awarded cash prizes, which you can use to purchase skill points. But that's about it; there's no detailed custom golfer mode, equipment bonuses are sparse as are the licensees including Taylor Made, Ping, Callaway Golf, Cobra, and Mizuno. In fact, making a custom player is downright unsatisfying and mediocre. You choose your base player (if you choose one of the few pros, you have limited options), change shirt colors, shoes and skin tone, but it doesn't do much to make the ~custom golfer~ feel like you. You can change things like ball logos to give them more style, but it's inadequate for all the custom player modes were seeing in today's videogames. The lack of something like a Pro Shop to spend your cash in is also underwhelming.     In the end, everything is middle-of-the-road about the design structure. It's not bad, it's not exceptional -- it simply suffices. Take that as you will, but for a franchise over a decade old, it seems devoid of advancements and in fact starts all over in a way. Even though it's not Microsoft's first entry into videogame golfing, it most certainly feels that way. It's the beginning of what could one day be a great Xbox exclusive golf franchise.    Currently, as it only delivers a typical experience, there's one reason to play and, yes, even own Links 2004: online play. Microsoft has integrated XSN and Live play into Links 2004, and if you're a golf fan and want to get online with Xbox, this is currently the only way to do it. You can play all the gameplay types online, including a quickened Fast Play style that allows all online players to swing and approach the whole simultaneously. You see colored arches of their ball flights painted in the skies above you as you go, and a readout of the current swing counts so you can see how you're doing. It works nicely for quick online play. We have to give credit to some of the other online presentation elements, too. You are able to play with two people on the same TV online; meaning, you and a buddy can hop online together. There are no team-play options, unfortunately.   With the massive leaderboards system and XSN tournament functionality it's a good online experience if you are fine with all the gameplay mechanics. It's also Xbox fans only current option to go online, which adds value.    Links 2004 is recommended mostly to online patrons, but also those looking for an intuitive golf experience, one that will make gathering friends around for multiplayer pretty easy.   Graphics  Links 2004 recreates the official courses and general golfing atmosphere to the same moderate success that the rest of the game sees. Texturing quality is a step above the competition (Tiger Woods) and so is player modelling, but the overall visual package is made somewhat run-of-the-mill due to the art execution. Lighting effects, weather -- rain, for example --aren't particularly impressive. Trees sway in the wind whether it is calm or breezy, and only the trees close to the player. This gives the world a more static feels.     There are some nice touches like self-shadowing on the players, but they are highly contrasted and oddly colored, which clashes with the goal for realistic shadowing. Grass effects, too, are in there and you'll see some individual blades when in the rough, but it's not the best use of Xbox's pixel-shading prowess we've seen elsewhere.   On the whole, it looks solid, but compared to Tiger Woods it runs at half the framerate, 30, and doesn't have the fluidity in animation or the same caliber of art design.    Sound  The sound design on Links 2004 is probably the one area that's most behind the times. Namely the commentary from Jim Nelford, Ken Venturi, Jeff Waters, and Rod Zundel is too predictable and in-pieces. Like the magnets that let you create sentences on you refrigerator, Links 2004 commentary feels synthetic. It's not particularly  moving, either. ~That whole was well played, and the result is a birdie.~ Get out of here, really!? ~We're on the second hole.~ Anymore useful insight? ~With the lob-wedge...~ [Pause]. ~From the fairway.~ It's all not as stale as this, but the majority is definitely very average and not up to par (side note: we've no fulfilled our duty to use this pun in a golf review).    Sound effects, meanwhile, get the job done. They don't feel awkward and they don't go too far to impress. In-game Dolby Digital is supported, of course, which is always nice to see. The soundtrack composition, however, is very out of place. It tries to paint Links 2004 with a hip, rocking theme, but it really feels wrong most of the time, bringing bright, distorted rock tunes and odd Casio-keyboard synth sounds to the table. You'll definitely want to use the custom soundtrack on this one, which is thankfully included, allowing you to switch through your collection at the touch of the white button during any game.   Overall, Links 2004 is aurally uninteresting, and the weak commentary needs to be fixed going forward.For me, I was excited about Links 2004 when I first heard about it, but when I finally laid hands on it I realized the franchise I'd been introduced to videogaming golf on had changed, only to try to go toe-to-toe with Tiger Woods 2004. I was counting on getting my simulation golf fix from Links, but what we have instead is just a solid, but average first entry into the more forgiving world of arcadey golf gaming. It's biggest value is its Xbox Live support -- no question. So if you're thinking of picking this one up, make sure it's for that reason. There are better golf games out there with far more robust single-player experiences. But, right now, this is an Xbox owners only option for taking golf online and the XSN support along with the leaderboards is nice.Overall, I definitely appreciate a few of the things Links 2004 does; for example, it allows you to roam in free camera and study the lie, and the green, which makes the short game a little more interesting. But its style, complete with Matrix-style bullet-time effects on good shots, puts it in a different realm than Links originally set out to explore. Which is going to be sad for any Links fan to see.Other than that, like I said, it's a solid entry that is most worthy for Xbox Live play.", "date": "Nov 27, 2003"}
