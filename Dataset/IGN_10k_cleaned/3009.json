Incoming Forces, for which you are here to learn about, adheres to the same principles its father laid out, only instead of slaughtering droves of vicious aliens, players join their ranks, killing the mindless apes we call people.  And boy is the human armada ever stupid. They might as well be slinging feces and mocking the greater Kaiyodo nation with group cackles like their banana eating, caged ancestors in the city zoo do to passersby, because their laser blasts and endless waves of attack craft certainly aren't enough to needlessly obliterate the otherwise peaceful and easy going Kaiyodans.   They try. Make no mistake, they try with fighters, they try with bombers, they try with tanks, they try with artillery... But for every bomb dropped, the human race loses at least a dozen men and mechanisms of war. And for what? To appease a raging paranoia that's gripped the species ever since their near defeat at the hands of the aggressive Teraumans some twenty years prior to this title's onset? It's not the fault of all Kaiyodans that a different alien race attacked the Earth. So when the apes come pounding on the four planetary doors of the Kaiyodan home system, what are the bulky green men to do but kick their smug asses all over the damn place?    And that's exactly what happens. For sixteen long, linear, objective-based missions, the human race suffers profound causalities in the air and on land. The soldiers pledged to the defense of Kaiyodo are adroit and capable of piloting and driving all kinds of futuristic weaponry (planes and tanks). This is what helps keeps the otherwise repetitious murder of many a man interesting, to an extent.   First-person with optional chase camera and HUD (though the chase comes with no targeting reticle and is thus impossible to play), Incoming Forces is air combat, ground combat, and stationary combat. Each method (plane, tank, turret) comes with several variations and drastically different control schemes. And herein lies the first severe problem.   The control setup is crazy. Each mode has its own separate configuration sub-menu a la AvP (cool). All of them crash when you try and setup a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro (not so cool). Unplugging that obscure peripheral and using a far more standard Super PSJoy, which no one can find or get to work, remedies the ~desktop is prettier than the game~ bug, but that doesn't mean other issues, like no options to bind acceleration and deceleration to analog control, get any better.   When the wanted pad is finally setup properly, assuming it's not made by Microsoft, players will likely find it necessary to swap the Y axis invert function every time a tank is exited and a plane is entered or vice versa. It's reasonable to assume that like me, most people prefer their planes to pitch like planes and their tanks to drive like first-person shooters (tanks). Now, I don't mind using a mouse on the dirt and a stick in the air, which is the best of both worlds that the game thoughtfully allows for, but having an axis function that applies across the board is wrong, wrong, wrong.    Ideally I would have been able to use the Sidewinder. Kind of ideally (thank you so much Stephen Butts for not helping me to find a better choice of words), I would have been able to at least bind my throttle and roll function to the right stick of my pad and turn and pitch to the left, like any flight/space action shooter worth its salt. When coupled with Descent or AquaNox up/down and left/right strafing, not wasting precious keys on simple functions like go and go back that control pads or throttles can easily accommodate is critical. Crashes and omissions in this department are both baffling and annoying.  Indeed, where applicable, the game retains a control schema very much like those two first-person shooters. But once the auto-leveling is turned off -- an immediate and mandatory switch to be done at the beginning of any level -- the flight action far surpasses that of AquaNox's slow, tiresome movement and uncannily high turn rate.  Effortlessly darting about the sparsely populated maps either above or below a paper thin cloud layer that's not as drastic a separator as what was seen in some levels of Crimson Skies makes me cry for more intricate urban sprawls like those found in G-Police, but thanks to the responsive control and surprisingly solid flight system, wherever the action is, it's fluid.   The game's four planets, each with varying scenery, come in day and night flavors and different colors, making them more distinct. Still, the few structures necessary for the resupply of a vehicle or completion of an objective like defense that dot these vast plots of nothingness remain relatively unchanged, thus the always fast, open, and shoot everywhere play dynamic remains relatively unchanged. It's disheartening but not debilitating thanks to the tight, intuitive, manageable control.       With that in mind, eschewing away from but not completely forsaking the arcade tradition in favor of a greater emphasis on piloting skill like that found in the above mentioned Crimson Skies or Starlancer would have been spectacular. There's just not enough pressure placed on the shoulders of the player to use talent to succeed. It's far too simple to hover in place facing the ground and pelting a tank into oblivion and even easier to circle strafe with a capable hover craft, devastating everything, everywhere.  I attribute the lacking aeronautic combat to two things: You can stop at anytime and pivot in place without worry of plummeting to an untimely death. And, slow moving lasers make manually targeting enemy craft at ranges nearly impossible. Instead, aligning the firing reticle and letting them have it once it turns red is all it takes. A simple nod to games long past by including a leading indicator and increased speed and accuracy of shots would have infinitely improved the whole. Instead, ground targets are dispatched with the classic stop right above them and shoot like crazy as you slowly back up technique, and air targets are taken down even easier by speeding toward their rear and incrementally accelerating to remain directly behind them. Downing the poor human bastards takes few fires.   Because you never quite know what vehicle you'll be in next (there are several optional and forced switches during a match), the jump from tank to plane or vice versa is a welcome one that brings with it a sense of accomplishment. I refer to it as the ~damn I hate this vehicle and am glad to be in the other one~ phenomenon. It spices up the action and keeps the monotony fresh, paradoxically.  It's not a very story-based game. Hints from Colony Wars on the way a shooter's plot should unfold need to be paid attention. What the game accomplish nicely, in part due to the cutscenes and sporadic voice work urging players into new objectives, is give the sense that these planets are actually under constant and very serious attack. A war is raging. Unfortunately, since the battles devolve to go here, kill them, go there kinds of affairs, this sense believability only lasts so long.   The help you get in missions bolsters the idea of a race struggling to fend off an aggressive menace, but the Wing Commander inspired commands are more there to divert the opposing hordes than to develop any kind of plot, immersion, or enriched tactics. For as glaringly inadequate and inept as fellow Kaiyodans seem to be, it's good that they can readily follow simple ~air superiority~ and ~ground superiority~ orders, which server as excellent additions to the normal array of ~attacks~ and ~form ups.~    Wonderful sounding engine hums, alien grunts, and a strangely epic score like a cut from the Ewok films improves horrible humans and lackluster lasers, but does not save them. As sufficing and satisfactory as the audio is, marred by noticeable bads, and pushed along by definite goods, the graphics are both pretty and ugly.  Why do the character models here look better than Mobile Forces? It's odd since they play a very small role in the delivery of the game. Odd, but not disliked. People seem to be of exceptionally high quality, given what the game is actually about and taken in that context. Only really seen during in-game cutscenes, but still consisting of rich color and articulated parts, they run in packs, smoke in packs, hang out with mechs and tanks and do other things to establish that there are folks behind the war (you can even see them driving the game's vehicles).  What did you think of Incoming Forces?   Explosions, though not at quite at jaw dropping Comanche levels or robust Freespace ones, are brilliant and made whole by many approachable particles that vibrantly scatter across and illuminate the sky. Slick and clean, the rest of the game features a lot of amply applied vertex shading and next-generation effects, which make the many smoothed over surfaces shine and reflect. Light hits the glass of the cockpit nicely, water shimmers, buildings reflect, etcetera. This all comes in vast, but stark environments. But then the game does run brilliantly smooth at reasonable settings and on reasonable machines (those recommended specs are fair).  And so we come to multiplayer, which clearly exists as an afterthought. Capable of supporting only eight players in only team deathmatch or deathmatch and only with either air or ground vehicles (never both), multiplayer is especially lacking. The style of Incoming Forces game all but demands something akin to Tribes or Battlefield, yet we get the absolute bare minimum. If the forgotten in-game server browser doesn't keep you out, everything else will. For shame. However repetitious, Incoming Forces is an enjoyable but pithy action title whose only real faults are far too heavy a slant on constant shooting, a whacked control configuration system, zero multiplayer of worth, and a complete failure to deliver on what the game logically should have aspired to become. The potential scope is there, the graphics are there, the flight dynamics are there, the premise is there, the delivery is not.Had a greater, more varied multiplayer component been included alongside the ability to jump in and out of any vehicle of more types and variations at any given time -- even proceeding on-foot into structures and whatnot when necessary or wished -- then this game could have delivered an epic experience to rival Battlefield, only on a precise, sci-fi level. Perhaps it could have become the next Battlezone, sans the strategy, or even the first Halo, what PC gamers envision that title ultimately turning into.  As is, Rage's latest is a novel if fleeting romp through a nostalgic age when just blowing the living hell out of everything in sight was enough. Still, it longs for improvement across the board, and thus must settle with being pigeonholed into that drab, but good and easily above average land we like to call the high sevens. Better action titles abound, try this one before you invest. It's not smart nor particularly demanding, but it is engaging, smooth and briefly fun.", "date": "Oct 3, 2002"}
