The first NES title featuring the character, simply called Yoshi, was made available for download in the Wii Shop last summer. And now the second, Yoshi's Cookie, has arrived in Virtual Console form as well.   Like Yoshi, Yoshi's Cookie is a puzzle game. But unlike Yoshi, Yoshi's Cookie isn't a ~falling block~ puzzler. This design is altogether different, and focuses on making matches of pieces in play by shifting them around with a cursor. You don't have control over pieces as they fall  you simply move the ones that have already fallen until there are no more left to move. The pieces are cookies, of course, and come in a variety of shapes  hearts, diamond shapes, squares and rounds. There's nothing special about any of them, as all are functionally the same. You just have to line up full rows or columns of the same shape to eliminate them from play.    For example, if you're looking at a stack of cookies that is three rows tall and three columns wide, you need to line up three of the same kind of cookie horizontally or vertically to remove them from play. And say you make a vertical match  then the matched column of cookies would disappear, and you'd be left with a stack of sugary sweets that only had two columns left. Matches then could be completed by only lining up two like cookies horizontally instead of three  it's all about getting the same kind of cookie to appear end-to-end on the stack, no matter how large or small the stack is.   Chef Mario operates the controls that shift the cookie stack.  The design may sound a bit confusing, and compared to more immediately understandable puzzlers like Tetris it does take a bit of a mental shift to wrap your head around  but you pick it up quickly after the first few rounds of play. The only real downfall to how Yoshi's Cookie is designed is that you'll often find yourself left with only one or two cookies in your stack and you'll have to wait around for the game to spawn new pieces for you, and hope that it gives you the right ones to be able to make a match and clear the stage. That waiting period can last a while, unless you manage to earn yourself a ~wild card~  the Yoshi's Face cookie that can appear and will match with any other cookie in play.   Yoshi's Cookie is fairly fun, but its appeal has never eclipsed those more traditional ~falling block~ puzzlers like Tetris, Dr. Mario or Puyo Puyo. There's an aspect of added strategy involved, as you can figure out ways to create chains of multiple matches or skillfully arrange the stack in such a way that one last shift of a single row or column will make every single cookie in play get matched and eliminated. But, even then, it's still a design that could only be called fair in its ability to keep you engaged.   Rounding out this package is a two-player head-to-head versus mode that is nice to see. It switches up the formula a bit, in that each player is given a five row, five column stack of 25 total cookies and tasked to make as many matches as possible before the other player can do the same. The box of cookies is constantly refilled in this mode, so there's no waiting around with only one or two cookies left in play, like the single player mode. It's more dynamic and fast-paced as a result.Overall, Yoshi's Cookie is a fair and favorable puzzler that  while not a candidate for immediate recommendation  wouldn't be a waste of your Wii Points should you decide to spend 500 of them on it. It's one of Nintendo's more obscure puzzle designs, and it sets itself apart in that it's not a clone of the ~falling block~ style of Tetris like so many other puzzlers are. Give it a look if you're a fan of the genre looking for something that's just a bit different.", "date": "Apr 7, 2008"}
