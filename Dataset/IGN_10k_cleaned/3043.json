{"name": "Epidemic", "name_review": "Epidemic", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/epidemic", "text": "Why bother making a sequel to a game no one liked in the first place? Movie studios do it all the time, but does that mean the video game industry has to follow suit? Epidemic, actually known as Kileak The Blood in Japan, is a mediocre sequel to an even worse Kileak: The DNA Imperative. Fortunately, there were some improvements made over the first game, but not really enough to warrant a release.  The first Kileak was basically a weak Doom clone. Epidemic is more of the same. The movement is still stiff but much smoother than the first. The biggest improvement lies in the variety of levels - if you ever saw the first you know it got pretty monotonous. Luckily this version features a much more detailed world to explore.  The cut- scenes, like in the first game, are done well, but add little to the overall gameplay which, incidentally, has also been improved. There's a larger variety of enemies, as well as a new locking target with which to kill them. There's also a run feature - something sorely lacking in the first. However, these few improvements have not saved the game. Epidemic just isn't that good.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
