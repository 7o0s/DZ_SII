{"name": "Neo Dragon's Wild", "name_review": "Neo Dragon's Wild", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/15/neo-dragons-wild", "text": "Although it may sound like an action title with prehistoric creatures, Neo Dragon's Wild is nothing more than five-card draw poker. Using the same engine as Dyna's other Pocket Casino titles, the game comes complete with a wide range of features, ranging from an additional pro level that lets players determine their own settings (it is unlocked once you have played 3,000 regular games), to bonus games, name registration and high score saving.  Features  Two Modes: Simple and Original. Regular and Pro Level settings. Bonus games. Change  dipswitch settings on Pro Level for different game options. Game dictionary feature.  Full bookkeeping to track your status. Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color.   The Game Like its real casino/arcade counterpart, Dragon's Wild Draw Poker is played with 53 cards (52 regular card plus one Joker  the Dragon). Draw poker allows players to discard their hands once before playing their poker hand. The best hand wins the game. If no hand is a winning hand, the game ends. A slot machine mini-game called Dragon Bonus and High Card Bonus and Double-or-nothing games provide a little variety, but other than that, this is straight-out draw poker with intuitive controls and primitive graphics and sound at best. The manual and has been aptly translated from Japanese, but the screen text could have used a little more editing: ~You must be enjoyed playing exciting REGULAR STAGE!~ The beauty of SNK's Pocket Casino games is that it doesn't take videogaming skills to play them. They're all based on existing casino games that have proven their addictive qualities with millions of gambling fans, so their merits as enjoyable games are not in question. But because of their relative simplicity, there should be a variety of card games on this cart  not just one. It's good five-card draw poker, but buy it only if you can get it for a cheaper price than a deck of cards.", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
