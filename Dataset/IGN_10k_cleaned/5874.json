The best of the bunch have managed to convey a respectable amount of the sport's ~thrill,~ while the lesser releases suffer from either poor presentation or shoddy mechanics. Nothing deep-sixes a golf game like a sloppy shot interface or an unwieldy course map. Perhaps that's why mini golf works so well on the smallest screen, as thusly, why Reaxion's Mini Golf 2 is such a success.   Immediately, Mini Golf 2's best feature is its incredible array of courses. There are no fewer than six nine-hole courses -- each with a unique theme, such as pirate. In addition to these holes, there are bonus holes and training shots, which propel the amount of real estate past most of Mini Golf 2's competition. You can putt through these courses via a career mode or play specific challenges, such as Up to Par or Time Attack.   Also pleasing is the game's create-a-player mode, which grants you the opportunity to create an in-game avatar. Reaxion's toolset allows you to tweak the basics, such as hair and outfit.   But how does it play, you inquire? Quite well.   Mini Golf 2's shot system is wonderfully simple to use. A dotted line helps you line up your shot, whether you're banking off a wall or going for the hole. Once your shot direction has been selected, you can adjust the power before letting 'er rip. The whole thing feels accurate -- the power, the shot direction -- at no point do you ever feel like the computer or the controls are cheating you. And that's what really makes a good golf game, whether it's putt=putt or the full meal deal.   While the game is certainly bright and colorful, I wish there was a little more movement to the courses. Things are slightly static and something this blazingly day-glo deserves to be more dynamic. Not that it gets in the way of enjoyment, but it certainly would be a great enhancement for a sequel.  Mini Golf 2 is a clever, competent little mini golf game that certainly had me entertained. I find that I prefer mini golf to regular golf on handsets thus far -- however, that could change with some of the sweet-looking 3D golfers coming soon -- just because it lends itself one to the one-touch game play that makes mobile so appealing. A definite download for mini golf fans and casual gamers.", "date": "Jul 8, 2005"}
