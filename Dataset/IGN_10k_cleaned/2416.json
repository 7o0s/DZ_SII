{"name": "Clusterball", "name_review": "Clusterball", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/09/clusterball", "text": "~Utopian Sporting Technology.~ That's what it says underneath a few of the load screens, and in a sense they are correct. There is no violence in Clusterball, there is only futuristic sporting competition. Futuristic sport sans bloodshed? Such a thing seems to be the very definition of paradoxical as far as gaming goes, but Strategy First's boxed copy of Clusterball (previously released as a download via Real.com) is just that, a paradox in nature (I'm talking contradiction for the brain melted layman -- I know you're reading this, dad). Its flight model and play dynamic revolve almost entirely around speed and maneuverability, yet its control falters. Still further, the game's sole redeeming factors are its simplicity and addictiveness, yet its repetitious nature and underdeveloped play styles contradict and undermine those very traits.   Clusterball is a game where you fly around, pick up balls, and run them through a goal.  There exists 11 venues that range from Egyptian to Metropolitan themed locales on which to play. Each is approximately the same in size (a respectably large expanse of land and hills dotted by structures and featuring a single goal ring somewhere therein). Though the environments change in appearance, they remain relatively the same. Aside from the city and lunar landscapes (that respectively feature buildings and darkness as their distinguishing factors) very little change in pace and play occurs between the 11 venues. Ball and powerup placement are naturally varied, but there are still tracks that remain as navigable as the ones before, and there are still confined depots that require splitting structures or walls to acquire powerups.   The formulaic approach to level design leaves little room for differentiation and radical changes in approach and play. Regardless of level, you'll still collect balls, shoot opponents with the intention of groping their balls, and crash into a whole lot of stuff losing all of your balls in nearly exactly the same way as the level before.   Strategy is then not developed or hinged around location, but instead married to the control and fundamental principles of the game. You must learn to properly attach to tracks, balance trips back from ball tracks to the goal ring, and weigh the consequences of engaging opposition to either disperse or steal their balls. Thankfully these facets of the game are where a majority of its strengths lie, so while the inclusion of more varied environs would have certainly been a substantial plus, their exclusion does not completely negate the purpose of, or enjoyment to be had with, the game as a whole.  What is aggravating and severely detrimental, though, is the blatant and felonious underdevelopment of modes of play. You can kick it free for all, or you can dig it as a team (still free for all, but now you have a smattering of chaotic helper monkeys on your side). You know how people bashed Quake 3 for having too few modes of play in light of its primary competition, Unreal Tournament? Well this is even worse because Clusterball has fewer modes of play, and the game as a whole features none of the other redeeming values of the primo Quaker. Obviously I wouldn't be so contrived, cruel, or stupid to craft a direct comparison between the two, but the example stands: if your title's intention is to have people play online competitively and solely competitively, then there had better be plenty for them to play.   In the realm of gameplay, Clusterball predictably delivers as sporadically as it does in every other category. The refreshingly simplistic, nonviolent play is a welcome slant to the scene, and the speedy, often intensely chaotic nature of the game can quickly become an addiction, but twitchy control mechanisms (however configurable) and the problematic transfer of the game's purpose from paper to reality mar what could have been a stellar experience.  Essentially you fly about these mentioned venues in either the first of third person and collect balls of different worth. Once you've accumulated a sizable quantity of balls (they string along behind you), it's a simple matter of threading the goal ring (one in each locale). The more balls you have when passing through the goal ring, the more points you will earn. With intentions of spicing up play, a wealth of powerups has been included. These weapons, as it were, run the gamut from tractor beams, to blow back missiles, to spaghetti noodles (bouncy tether), to inventions that straight up snatch balls from the clutches of your opponents. Each is designed and balanced to add a new dimension to play, or to reverse the existing ones as the control inverter so painfully demonstrates.   Leveraging ball collection, taking a defensive posture against your opposition, and taking an offensive posture against your opposition in the heat of blurring match-ups can be intense, but comes with its own set of faults.  The control scheme is more akin to an arcadey flight combat game than it is a first person shooter. Certainly mouse and keyboard control are optional, but the game is best played with a joystick or gamepad (read: joystick). The problem is that, unlike Crimson Skies, Airfix Dogfighter, or even a typical space shooter (anything that's ~normal~ or accepted), Clusterball is delivered somewhat differently. In those aforementioned games, you depressed and held a direction on the stick to fly in that direction or rotate your craft in that direction. When you press left on the joystick in X-Wing your vessel turns to the left and will only do so as long as you continue to press left. As soon as you let up on the stick, however, the plane will stop moving and retain its current orientation, whatever that me be, until you use the joystick again to move it another way. Stay with me, this has a point... Conversely, when you hit left in Clusterball, your craft will turn to the left and continue moving to the left unless you hit right to counteract this initial motion. Push to the left just for a second and then let the stick snap back to its original position and your craft will continue turning left indefinitely... This really sucks (behold the poignant master of eloquence at work).  Flopping around and becoming disoriented is the norm in Clusterball. It's only with a lot of practice that you can really begin to master the controls and effectively compete against the steeper competition, which leads us to two other points of significance (the master of eloquence and segue, that is). Everyone can come to grips with the control scheme, but if you're one of those who actually likes it and continues to play, you'll find that both AI and human encounters are somewhat lacking.   Clusterball has what I like to call the super jerk AI. These are mean kind of punks. They'll use weapons on you for no damn reason at all. You could have zero points, and the leader could have 346 and still some of the players will do their utmost best to kill you. Whee! I especially love how they use the invert control weapon (self-explanatory), but are smart enough to wait until it wears off before they hit you with the blow back missile (throws you about a mile in the opposite direction). Playing with the computer on anything above easy can be annoying as all hell, but in fairness, the game is built exclusively for online play (the single player mode being dubbed ~Training~ was kind of hint).  Again, online play is an aspect of Clusterball where the game both excels and stumbles. Playing with a maximum of seven other people is where the proverbial it is at, but the hectic, fast nature of the title makes it at times difficult to fully and effectively utilize the various powerups and enjoy the personal interaction with other gamers. Thankfully, ball collection and delivery relies on properly aligning your craft with ground-based tracks (balls rest on these tracks that you attach to) or the goal ring. This means there are plenty of instances, if you're quick enough to capitalize on them, where you'll get to punish people looking to peaceably gather up some balls for themselves. But then, an unwelcome nod to the control scheme, even this can be difficult, or at least frustratingly imprecise even when mastered.  More emphasis on a tightly developed flight model and actual dodging and piloting skill to avoid and counter enemies would have really been swell. Instead, Clusterball seems to find its balance because of the twitchy control scheme and not in spite of it. ~Yeah, we can have big open spaces because chances are you'll be to busy flopping around to hurt anybody or dodge anything anyway.~  Aurally, the game impresses with what little sound effects it has (wind flying by and crowd noise distorting as you buzz the audience), but dazzles with its confounding lack of music. There's music in the game alright. I can hear it in the freaking menus and load screens, so why the hell is not present during play? I found no option for it, and cranking the volume only makes the smoke puff weapon louder (not that noisy smoke puffing is bad). It's really too bad too, because I liked the menu music... Oh, great! Now I'm all sad and stuff.  Graphics = old butt of once highly attractive person. Yeah, there's still some pleasantness to be found in there and you can live with it, but really, it ain't hard to find better. The now dated engine and its 16-bit colors create a lot of banding. Add to this unimpressive texturing and even less impressive texture filtering and you have a dusty recipe for a decidedly bland cocktail (the non-alcoholic beer for the raging drunks amongst us). In the game's defense, it moves pretty damn fast (not like Ballistics' instant epilepsy or anything) and has an acceptable draw distance with decent, if at times mediocre architecture and such.  Sure it's only twenty bucks, and it can be pretty enjoyable, but then Serious Sam will also only deplete your grocery reserve by twenty dollars and that game is always darn bleedin' enjoyable. Value of others aside and despite lacking in one way or another in virtually all respects, Clusterball still pulls off a refreshing blood free, but still faced-paced competition that, however twitchy and underdeveloped, remains average at best and worst, a select few able to cope with awkward controls may even find it an addiction.   -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
