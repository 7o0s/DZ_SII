Gameloft is adding Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 to the field, and despite it being slightly out of stride with the rise and fall of the annual pulse of baseball, it is easily one of the best representations of the sport for mobile. We previously crowned JAMDAT's baseballer the pennant champ, but leave it to GL to give the studio a serious run. In fact, expect this and JAMDAT's next baseball game to really slug it out for the numero uno spot next season.   Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 offers a more well-rounded take on baseball rather than zeroing in on just batting and pitching. True, the great battle between pitcher and batter provides most of the excitement in the sport, but there is certainly ample opportunity for high drama in the field, and Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 exploits this with a number of clever additions that other baseballers just don't have.   One of the most neglected aspects is baserunning -- most mobile baseballers (and even some console versions) automate most of this game play element. Not Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005. You have full control over stealing and retreating, which can really lead to some tense moments if you are quick enough to either catch the computer trying to snag an extra base or if you are caught doing the same. Getting caught between, say, second and third base is a tight spot that is not impossible to get out off, but it sure is difficult. Which, of course, makes the pay-off of diving for third and nailing it all the more rewarding.   Fielding can indeed be automated for speed play -- which certainly has its time and place -- but for a deeper game, try taking on the task yourself. You can actually control the individual players in the field, as well as power up throws for greater power -- which in turn seems to possibly decrease accuracy.   Don't believe for a second, though, that Gameloft's decision to include these other facets of the American pastime was to the detriment of batting and pitching. Pitching is incredibly easy to handle, with a nice system that allows you to select a variety of pitches depending on the individual player. Once the appropriate pitch is chosen, you must then chose where you want to throw the ball. A heater right down the middle? Or a sinker that looks high before swooping down quickly to confuse your opponent?   Batting is a complete improvement over all other baseballers. Your swings are mapped all over the number pad with keys corresponding to areas in the strike zone. Timing gets things started, while your swing in relation to the placement of the pitch formulates the outcome. For example, if you swing high while a ball is thrown low, you will either whiff it entirely (an embarrassing predicament) or swat a grounder that the computer-controller pitcher will have no problem scooping up for an easy out at first.   Which brings us to a brief discussion of the AI in Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005. Gameloft stood just on this side of merciless when programming the computer in this game. The game rarely makes errors, so don't expect to perform spectacularly on your first few attempts. However, when you start getting familiar with the controls and how to field properly, you'll find the computer to be a most excellent match. Slugfest this is not. Contests are often tight, keeping things exciting for the duration.   Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 is a stunner. The artistry involved in bringing the affair to life is a minor marvel -- in other words, classic Gameloft. The player sprites are expertly drawn with excellent use of color and shadow. Depending on where players stand on the diamond, the game shades them appropriately, giving the game the kind of depth perception you'd demand from a proctologist. The exquisite audio matches the visuals, with great voice clips and stadium music.  After playing Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 in the privacy of my home office for several hours, I was ready to give the game a superior score. However, when I found myself stranded on the side of the freeway today for four hours, the game was nothing short of manna from heaven. Waiting for a tow went by in the blink of an eye and I found myself actually mildly irritated when people stopped to ask me if they could help, only because I knew I was wasting precious battery time fielding their sincere offers. Only now do I feel guilty. Honestly, if you are only going to download one baseball game, you should make it Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005. It stands up to the mighty JAMDAT baseballer and then some. Some may prefer the more arcade-ish JAMDAT game -- which is still a damn fine baseball game -- but for a complete package, Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 simply cannot be beat. I can hardly wait to see what improvements Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2005 will inspire in the next crop of baseball games. Gameloft, always the innovator, scores again.", "date": "Jul 7, 2005"}
