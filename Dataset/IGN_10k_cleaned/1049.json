The four on each cartridge represent good value for money, especially if retro-gaming is your thing -- but mixed up amongst the classics you can always find a title or two that should never have been considered. This collection, the third of the continuing series, lives up to the highs of the first installment whilst burrowing down to discover a truly new low.   Features: Four games: Pop'n Twinbee, Mystical Ninja, Bikers and Guttang Gottung Variable levels of difficulty.  For Game Boy and Game Boy Color Konami GB Collection Volume 3 is divided into four specific games, the majority of which existed on the Game Boy back in the dominating black and white days.  Pop'n Twinbee: Predictably, Konami once again open the collection with one of their famous shooters. The difference lies in the perspective: unlike Gradius, for example, the action here is viewed from above, much like the classic Solar Striker.  It's a simple -- but zany -- little game, requiring you to maneuver from the bottom of each of the six auto-scrolling levels to the top, blasting the waves of enemies on the way. The clouds that float by can be shot to release golden bells, which, when blasted, change from one sort of power-up to the next: your ship can be upgraded impressively, with force fields, pods and very cool three-way lasers. Graphically, there isn't anything particularly mind-blowing: the grass and the sea are green (eh?); the clouds are white; your ship is one colour; and the enemies are another. The six bosses are nice and large, with a lot of variety between them and their different attack-patterns, and there are other small details, such as the rocks in the ocean and the trees on the land. It won't win any artistic awards, but everything does its job nicely enough. What makes this better than Gradius or Parodius is that it's simply much more fun to play -- it's hard to say why, exactly, but I found myself addicted to this very quickly. Perhaps the difference in perspective allows this game to concentrate more on the blasting action; it is certainly far more frantic, and great fun, even after repeated attempts. The difficulty level is nigh on perfect too, allowing you to progress just a little bit further each time you play. If you're interested in shoot-'em-ups, you'll love this game -- Konami have chosen wisely.  Mystical Ninja: Some years ago, a tragic series of events (I forgot to take my N64 with me on holiday) led me to the nearest Electronic Boutique, desperate to purchase a new title for my Game Boy Pocket. Eventually I chose the just-released Mystical Ninja, only to find, an hour or two later, that it was, well, somewhat dull. I dejectedly threw down my Game Boy, consigning myself instead to a week of talking to my parents. Which brings us long-windedly to my review. Despite expecting to turn to my thesaurus in a search for alternatives to the word 'boring', I received a pleasant surprise: this is a different Mystical Ninja, in no way the same game as Konami's earlier, black and white effort.  This Mystical Ninja is a highly enjoyable game, similar to Zelda but broken down into several large, side-scrolling levels, mixing basic platform and beat-'em-up elements in with the adventuring. You play Goemon; off on a quest to rescue his friend Ebisumaru, his only clue to the intent of the kidnappers is a mysterious letter.  The structure is fairly linear: you advance from town to town by solving a series of fairly obvious puzzles, most of which involve the collection of an item that you then have to carry across the level to where it is needed. There isn't much exploration, though most of the town residents have to be badgered for clues and other information. A constant onslaught of enemies assails you on the main paths, but a quick hammering usually makes light work of them. Killing them reveals money, which can be used at shops or hotels if you're low on energy.  The game is hardly as involving as Zelda, but it is immensely fun all the same. The locations are varied, with a lot of typically insane Japanese humour, and -- though simple -- the tasks required of you are all interesting: it's impossible not to smile when a tiny Game Boy sprite mutters 'There'll be lots of girls in the capital. Heh heh heh...'  Defeating the barrage of enemies can get repetitive; thankfully, there are few sections where action is the only element. Some of the platforming set pieces are reasonably difficult; and the boss battles in particular are a genuine challenge., requiring excellent reflexes. Saving is accomplished using the passwords obtained at the end of each level -- a battery-save would be preferred, though the passwords are not particularly long or annoying.  Everything looks nice and solid too: the characters are far larger and clearer than most on the console, and their animations are simple but different, their death-sequences particularly funny. The music is very Japanese and always suits the action and the surroundings, complementing the fun gameplay.  Konami have two winners so far. Let's hope the next game lives up this high standard.   Bikers: Bikers, a simple arcade-style racing game, viewed from the side, is fun enough, though hardly spectacular. It was released as Motocross Maniacs in the States, and the color only version is available as Motocross Maniacs 2 and is way better.  You start by choosing whether you would like to race against a computer-controlled player or just the clock, then go on to select one of nine courses and one of three difficulty levels. The races involve lots of cool ramps and loops, which look neat, but there's never much more than simply going as fast as possible from left to right. You can collect nitros, which temporarily boost your speed, and other pickups, such as tires that stop you from slowing down in sand or gravel.  The game is enjoyable in short bursts; but there's never really anything surprising or challenging. The racing gets tired after a few minutes, without any variety in the obstacles or any interesting landmarks. It's fairly easy to be knocked from the saddle, and it's cool how responsive the controls of the bike are, allowing you to flip in the air and ride along on one wheel to avoid low rocks. But you'll have seen everything there is to this game after just one race.  The tiny graphics ensure everything is smooth and fluid, but also destroy any real sensations of power and speed. The individual races are also too long to keep the player enthralled, when everything stays so similar throughout.  Overall, this isn't a bad game; it's just not a particularly great one either.   Guttang Gottung: There isn't much to say about this game, mainly because it's all but incomprehensible.  It's nearly impossible to actually explain what has to be done -- though the instruction manual makes a fair attempt -- involving trains, railway-lines and those annoying sliding-puzzle tiles that no one in their right mind finds enjoyable. The screen is divided into several rows of tiles, a section of rail fixed onto each. Your train advances around the rails, exploding when it reaches a dead-end. Using the d-pad, you can manipulate the square tiles by moving them into and around the spare space. The aim, as far as I can tell, seems to be to maneuver the tiles so that the rails allow the train to pass all of the stations on the grid.  Whilst this seems fair enough, the implementation of this original idea is very poor indeed. You simply aren't given enough time to think about things; and the method of control is so strange that it's incredibly hard to visualize the route that the train needs to take. There's no margin for error at all: the train moves along entirely independently and so cannot be reversed; you need amazing reflexes to even stand a chance of arranging the tiles in time, and once things begin to go wrong, there's virtually no hope of getting the train back on track. Once you've lost a life, the train reappears exactly where it crashed rather than at its original starting point -- you're already far from the required route, and very likely to die again within a second of restarting.   The simplistic graphics and the basic, substandard sound give no incentive whatsoever to advance. You're simply reminded of how many better games you could be playing -- games that are actually fun. This, on the other hand, is one of the least playable I've seen. Two excellent games, one moderate one and something that is almost unplayable combine to produce a package that is actually worth the asking price, despite its shortcomings. It would probably get the same rating if Mystical Ninja and Pop'n Twinbee were included alone, as other developers would have no qualms about releasing games of that calibre separately. They are not as outstanding or as long lasting as some recent releases, but outshine the majority in terms of playability.  The only real questionable factor about this series as a whole is Konami's refusal to release them outside Europe: thousands of American's would surely devour the chance to replay some of these classics. If, however, you have fond memories of some of the games included here, I urge you to go to your nearest import-dealer and seek this cart out. Just remember to walk, rather than run.Note: Konami GB Collection Vol. 3 is currently only available in Europe -- Konami has no plans on bringing this game to the US -- if this game interests you, you might want to look into importing the game -- check your local import house for details.", "date": "Jun 23, 2000"}
