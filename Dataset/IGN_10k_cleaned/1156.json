Not all of the talk was good, mind you, but at least developers had made it past snowboarding and into another extreme sport. Gamers were receptive, too. But it wasn't until Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, however, that people finally sat up and listened; now they can't hear anything except Tony Hawk.   In a strange way, Ubi Soft and SunSoft have collaborated on a surfing game that strikes an amazing similarity to Street Sk8ter's arrival: the game is simplistic and rough around the edges, but it's strangely addictive, and it's the first of its kind. Since I grew up in Southern California surfing every come rain or shine, I have been itching to get my hands on a surfing game, and the day has finally come. But is it any good?  Gameplay The game is so simple that it's reminiscent of the games that appeared in the Super NES. Players have two modes of play, Free Play mode, and World Challenge Cup mode. In free play, you simply go to a location, and without any time limits you surf. It's best for practicing, and let me tell you -- YOU'LL NEED TO PRACTICE. If there is any one thing I can say for certain about Surf Riders is that it'll take you hours before you can pull off the most basic of tricks.   Before I digress too much, the other mode, World Challenge Cup Mode is a tournament that leads to five surf spots all over the globe, and pits you against the best surfers in the world. The object is to score as many points as possible by doing a couple of things. Points are based on four techniques: how long you ride a wave, the height and number of turns you make in an aerial, how high you kick up spray, and how long you stay in the tube.  In the Challenge, if you score in the top two or three the semi final heat opens up and give you more time. If you score in the top in the semi final, you compete in a final heat that also provides you with more time. In each the competition gets tougher, so you have to as well.   The rounds follow in this order; note the different kinds of waves:  Round 1: Manly Beach, Australia --  Good tube ride, decent size and fun;  Round 2: Grand Plage, Lacanau, France --  Bigger wave, big barrel;  Round 3: Huntington Beach California -- A little mushier wave, medium size barrel and lots of room for tricks and aerials;  Round 4: Tonami Beach, Japan --  The smallest wave of the five, the mushiest wave, but the best wave for stunts, off-the-lips, air tricks and cutbacks;  Round 5: Pipeline, Hawaii -- The biggest barrel of the bunch and the fastest wave. Difficult to do any kinds of aerials at all, and cutbacks are almost impossible.   It's strange, but somehow the wave/beach design works. The waves at each individual beach are the same every time, but once you finish at one beach you have to prepare for a whole new kind of wave at the next. If you have ever seen Wave Race 64 on Nintendo 64, then these pitiful attempts at waves will make you laugh. There is no variation. The waves are always the same. Weirdly, this consistency based on the game design, functions. You'll need each wave to be consistent, because the controls take so long to get to grips with that any variation would surely drive you to the funny farm for a permanent stay.   You have the choice to pick a new board before you surf there, which is helpful. What would have been even more helpful is a little hint here and there telling you what kinds of boards work better at what beach. I grew up surfing and I already know this stuff, but the fact is videogame waves are, erm, different than in real life, and even I didn't know which board to pick. It's trial-and-error gameplay without any explanations. This is just one example of where Surf Riders is incredibly overly simplistic, poorly thought out, and reaches the ~major suck~ in the presentation department. And yet, I am strangely addicted to it nonetheless.   The amount of tricks in the game is quite small, but after hours of practice, you'll find that each trick has variations that show quite a bit of depth. It took me hours to learn how to perform an off the lip, but once I got it down, I could then perform a better slashback, cutback, and 360. To perform an off the lip or slashback, you press Square and down. To gain speed, press circle; to perform a trick keep Circle pressed down and let up on it right before you leave the lip of the wave. Square slows you up, for bigger waves with larger circumference barrels. The Dpad enables you to cut and wave back and forth to gain speed and to perform different moves when you are up in the air.    For here's another good comparison: while Thrasher was very hard to learn, a sim at heart, and totally unforgiving, Surf Riders is very hard to learn, is an arcade game at its core, and could be more forgiving. Because I grew up surfing I feel that I had more desire to get this thing right and master it before I gave up. Perhaps those of you who buy this game who don't surf will have the same determination, and I hope you do, because in the end, Surf Riders is a good, fun game. The learning curve is really steep, but the reward is pretty damn solid. I mean, damn! I'm finally playing a surfing videogame! For those of you who give up, I don't blame you one bit, the controls are twitchy and difficult, you wipeout hundreds of times before you can do anything worth showing to your buddy, and the trial-and-error gameplay is maddening.  Graphics The other aspect of Surf Riders that is totally Super NES is that not one single aspect of this game says ~I am a 32-bit.~ In other words, folks, the graphics suck. They're interesting, but they suck. I mean, for instance, each beach has a different color of water, blueish, greenish, brownish, etc. The waves always look the same, yet the water and wave patterns are neat the first time you see them. It's kind of like looking at blue parchment paper in motion. Neat, but for only about one minute.   As for the surfers, it seems no thought or creativity went into designing them at all. You have a choice of five surfers, two girls and three guys. It doesn't matter who you pick, because they don't have any characteristics, and don't earn any. What's even more pathetic is that in the water, you CANNOT determine the difference between any of them at all. Lame, SunSoft, lame. No professional surfers back this product either, and so instead we get characters whose genius lies in their name. For instance, the skin head, low rider, Fender Gibson. Like ~woah!~ That should be a real funny joke out there for all of you guitar players. Ha ha. Don't forget to laugh.   Lastly, since there really isn't too much to the graphics, there are the surfer animations. Pick any one -- aerials, cutbacks, the splash of the waves, etc. -- are all missing about 20 cells of animation each (which is to say almost all of them), so each one looks extremely choppy and crude. It's not like the game depends on its graphics, but in the fifth year of the PlayStation, we expect more than this crud.  Sound Well, if you remember those wild and crazy days of dancing and surfing with Annette Funicello and Franky Avalon, then you may dig these crazy tunes, daddy-o. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed to find that, at least according to Ubi Soft and SunSoft, surfers listen to Wipeout rip-offs and ~rad~ guitar music from the early '60s. It only fits if you believe in stereotypes, which I guess is sadly fitting for the vidoegame industry, so I'll lay off. Nah, I take it back. ~Yo, Ubi Soft! There isn't any type of music that surfers listen to, but if there was perhaps a common denominator, it would be the same kind of music that was in Tony hawk Pro Skater -- punk, thrash, rock!~In the end, I have to say I am totally addicted to this crappy-somehow fun, totally simplistic surfing game, and I can't explain why exactly. Perhaps you have to love surfing. Perhaps it's because of the ridiculous challenge. I mean it took me hours to barely get to grips with a single move. That can't be very enticing for anyone. But when I finally mastered the controls, and I have pulled off major aerials, minute long tube rides, and killer off the lips, I started having a lot of fun. The gameplay is there, it really is, but it's a lot of work to get to it, hidden behind difficult controls and unforgiving waves, and absolutely precise timing. It's not much to look at or listen to, either, but I can't stop playing.", "date": "Aug 10, 2000"}
