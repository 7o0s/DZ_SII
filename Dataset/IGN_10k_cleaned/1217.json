Amiga systems made fertile breeding grounds for products in this genre, giving rise to classics like Pinball Fantasies.  Gone now are the 21st Century Entertainment's of the world, fallen into extinction due to changing tastes and diminishing returns.  Lately, if it's bumper bashin' action you crave, bargain bin scrutinization's a necessary evil.  Throughout these dark days though, PC players can count on at least one standard bearer to keep the torch burning for Tommy's legacy: the 3D Ultra Pinball series.  On such an open market playing field, it would've taken a major kludge to monkeywrench Thrillride's ambitions.  Mercifully, no Chernobyl size boo boos are readily apparent in the game, which borrows its architectural getup from Pennsylvania's tastiest tourist trap, Hersheypark.  Visitors to this world of cotton candy Americana will find all the trappings of an amusement park to be intact, including the requisite water rides and overpriced snack/sounvenir shops.  Mega-high scoring fun is a flick of the plunger away... pardon the cliche' (and the unintentioned rhyme.. ).  First let's get down to basics.  The quality of the simulation is excellent.  Balls roll convincingly around the table, losing or gaining momentum according to the rules of physics.  Bumpers hurtle the shiny baubles every which way but up, as that job falls to the Coal Cracker (log boat), Wildcat (coaster), and Wave Swinger (tilt-a-whirl) ramps.  Stop to admire the scenery and you'll be hard pressed to keep the ball out of the gutter, even with a half dozen flippers at your disposal.    But no recreation of coin-op silverball would be complete without a smorgasbord of special modes, liberally globbed on glitter, or gaudy polish.  Needless to say, the program excels on all counts, touting an unbeatable array of flashing lights, moving gadgets, and bonus rounds.  In addition to the usual multiball and jackpot awards, players can unlock the Thrill Zone, a section of the park padded with silly little diversions.  The water covered Fun Zone's where the best stuff lies, including large scale mini-games such as river rafting or a ride on a virtual coaster.  Though parts of the visual presentation are grainy, Bally would kill to get their hands on a machine this eye-catching.  Parts are in constant motion, with roller coasters and logs creaking along in the hopes of stealing a ball whilst a bevy of lights blinks enticingly below.  Side trips to the snack bar call up miniature representations of junk food in the on-screen display.  Giant, high-flying rides shoot up out of the terrain when a switch is activated.  Knock off every attraction on the checklist and watch as daylight fades in honor of the Nighttime Fantasy Event.  You won't hear any complaints outta me on the music or sound effects either.  Light, cheerful compositions echo from the disc, yet remain unobtrusive, dying out during play.  Metallic and futuristic noises, combined with old carnival jingles, are the ideal means to turn that frown upside down.  Company's not far off, either, since a pair of regular characters, including a narrator and enthusiastic tourist, engage in random banter to keep players entertained.  Alas, one lonely table's destined to lose its appeal faster than the Survivor phenomenon.  Multiplayer mode's a small consolation, but to make the most of it, you'll need to gather four people around the same computer.  Sadly, the absence of replay value incentive is a crucial flaw that's haunted almost every pinball machine developed since the devices were first patented.  And while 3D Ultra Pinball goes to great lengths to address the problem, it ultimately falls prey to the family curse.  -- Jason Song", "date": "Sep 2, 2000"}
