The problem is, I'm no Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen, and usually can't even leave my apartment in the morning without forgetting to shave, put on deodorant or wear pants. (I'm getting tired of the cat-calls from construction workers.) So I have to settle for simulating a prison break on the computer. Problem is, there isn't much out there in this department. It's one of those ~niche~ markets, I guess. Unfortunately, Rebels: Prison Escape didn't really satisfy my Houdini Jones, thanks most to some frustratingly difficult gameplay and forgettable storyline.Rebels takes place in what appears to be a neo-industrial future dictatorship, one where prisons are apparently as popular and widespread as Starbucks, but not as much fun. And although the world map looks to be on the scale of an island, you'll encounter some wildly different climates and levels of habitation. I started out in a city, but wound my way through both dense tropical environments and snowy mountains, complete with wide ethnic differences. The dudes in the mountains sounded like the Swedish Chef, for example. Sure, this keeps the game fresh, but spreading this stuff out across a continent would've made more sense.In Rebels, you'll play the various roles of five different imprisoned insurgents who were captured at the beginning of the game and thrown into different jails all across the map. You'll start with Blake, a bruiser who's special skills include knocking people out and playing dead. You'll then head to a Japanese-influenced temple of some kind and gradually uncover the secrets of Friedrich's power (the dictator who rules the land with the usual,  clichd iron fist). You'll only control up to three people at a time, and can simply click and drag and get them to all go somewhere or do something at the same time. Instead, you switch between them with the function keys, and every time you do this, you'll get a canned phrase from one of them. It's enough to make you want to play the game with no sound pretty early on.  But the big issue here is difficulty. Although moving from point A to point B without getting seen and killed in short order is difficult, it's challenging instead of frustrating. My problem is with the lack of direction. There's too much hunting around for specific foozles and talking to people to magically move the game along, for my tastes. Rebels works great as a stealth game, but its adventure element bogs gameplay down to a crawl while you figure out why you can't open this door and why it's impossible to get to this one room.In order to leave the first base, for example, you have to pick up a sheet, although you don't know you're going to need it until you pick it up. Once you grab this sheet, you get some criminally vague clues about a chimney somewhere that would cause a lot of problems if it got clogged. Once you stuff the chimney, a grand total of one guard will pull away from a spot you need to get past. And once you finally get out of the prison, after doing some irrelevant Fed Ex quests, you still have to escape the city, which is patrolled by no-nonsense commandos. To get out of the city, you have to use a saw to cut through a waist-level barricade. No, I don't get it either. The only way to succeed in these levels is to pick up everything you can reach and hope it comes in handy later.    Thankfully, you'll have a map of the entire level, with items in yellow, guards in red, and prisoners in orange. After talking to key people, your next destination will get marked on your map. But there's a problem here, too. I can pan and rotate the camera over the entire base, not just where I am. There's no kind of fog of war; I can see the patrols, see the items I need to pick up, and be able to figure out exactly how I'm going to get there while just standing at the entrance. It's like magic! I suppose you need this feature in order to deal with some wide-ranging patrol guards, but it's so powerful that it reduces much of the tension. Instead, it's a matter of figuring out how to avoid the guards' curiously short-ranged cone of perception.You'll have to deal with three standard types of guards. The lowest level is identified by a blue cone, and can be fooled by traps, playing dead, and other devices. The yellow cone guys are smarter, and will raise the alarm if you try any of that funny business. The red cone guys, the Commandos, have a much wider cone and will attack you on sight with their rifles, which hurt a lot. The commandos will also search for you room-to-room if they find a dead body during an alarm. There are precious, precious few places to hide, and they're not always easy to get to. A basket here, a wardrobe there; it's really not an option. You'll have to save often to prevent lots of re-treading.Thankfully, the game offers three quick-save slots, so if you accidentally save when you meant to load, you can still go back to the next-oldest save game, instead of being stuck with your last manual save. It also takes a long time to load a manual save, even on a top-of-the-line system. Plus, when you die, you have to sit through a ten-second ~Mission Failed~ title screen before you can jump back in.  Rebels is a fairly solid stealth/adventure game that probably done a lot better if it left out the item hunting and plot-mover conversations--the adventure part in other words. Not that there's anything wrong with adventure, but it's been done better elsewhere. I'd say stick with Splinter Cell and Metal Gear solid for your stealth needs.Sometimes, a budget game is a diamond in the rough, a sleeper hit, and/or the harbinger of a new phenomenon in gaming. Rebels isn't one of those games. It ran flawlessly, though, with nary a crash or lockup, however it did squeeze my icons into a 1024x768 square every time I quit the game. Odd? Yes.In the long run, Rebels can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an adventure game or a stealth sim of some kind, and this ambiguity prevents it from melding the two ideas together.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
