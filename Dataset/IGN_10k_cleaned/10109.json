And why not? The series has always stayed true to the fact that it upholds gameplay above all else, and isn't that what truly makes a fun game in the end?   The truth is that in most cases Bomberman titles are more fun to play with than the magazines hidden in your uncle's ~No No Drawer.~ And Bomberman Fantasy Race is no exception to the rule! Sounds Japanese enough for you?  Any game featuring curiously colored anime kangaroos and rhinos as your only mode of transportation most likely is, and I'll be damned if that isn't a perfect formula!  Gameplay Although not terribly huge, Bomberman Fantasy Race has several courses that boast enough variety to keep you coming back for awhile.  If you're expecting a mammoth amount, however, you should put your tail between your legs and scamper off, because Atlus' wacky racer can only brag about having seven courses.   The fact is, since you play the same courses over and over again to reach different goals and against different racers, the short course count doesn't matter too much. Placing high in the races can earn you loads of Bomberman Coins, used to enter into more races, especially if you come in first. The you can play in the bonus round for even more cash!  Once you've collected a good stash, you're able to spend it on several different things.  For one, if you're interested in playing at a new track, you can buy a ticket to race in it. Or perhaps you'd rather have a new animal to strap yourself down to. In that case, head over to the Stable and see what available creatures are for sale. Naturally, the most expensive ones are the best, and if you're willing to shell out your winnings for a top-notch ~Louie~ or ~Tirra,~ you'd better aim for one who you know will help win back your precious stash in no time flat.   On top of that, you are also able to purchase several items at the beginning of the race that might give you a starting boost.  Fairly inexpensive, they can certainly pay off if you know when to use them, and it's always nice to know when you have something in your reserves that can give you an edge.   Aside from the one player mode, there are several of other ones that are just as entertaining: Versus Mode:  Your normal racing battle mode between you and a buddy.  One thing you're able to do in this mode that isn't available in the others is wager your Bomberman Coins based on the outcome of the race.  Time Attack Mode:  Race against the clock to top the best times. You are only able to enter courses you have purchased tickets for, however. You also can save your name, times, and used animal on the Ranking Screen.  Ghost Mode:   Hand in hand with the Time Attack Mode, you can save your ghost data. Plus, you can exchange your ghost with a friend.  In addition to this, there are six different racers form which to choose, ranging from White Bomberman, the naturally politically correct Black Bomberman, Pretty Bomber, Mach Bomber, Mechbomber, and the obviously creatively-titled villain, Burglar. Although you only start off with two possible ~vehicles~ with which to race, there's a total of 10 in the end, provided you have enough Bomberman Coins to afford them all.   The courses themselves, consisting of the simple Bomber Circuit, Bomber Coaster Lake, Waca Island Beachside, Bakuzan Ski Course, Star Express, Dyna Mountain, and the Bomber Castle, all offer a surprising amount of entertainment. All with strikingly similar themes to Mario Kart 64, Bomberman Fantasy Race has actually achieved a peculiarly good job of putting together a fun racing game. Although there are a lack of tracks to dash through, the existing ones are definitely packed with fun-filled action.  Graphics Perfectly fitting for such a game, Bomberman Fantasy Race's look is cartoonish, and easily fits under the ~Kids~ category.  It's easy to see that the graphics stress the game's aim toward younger players, especially since it's filled to the brim with cute animals and quirky characters. Definitely not on the ~realistic~ side, the graphics are often a little bit simple, but feature quite enough to get their point across.   With few special effects, none that exactly will lead to a loss for words, Bomberman's latest racing adventure still manages to look nice, and rarely seems to slow down during intense moments.  Featuring little to no pop-in, as well as absolutely no polygonal tear, there is absolutely nothing to complain about.  Despite the undoubtedly cute appearance, Bomberman Fantasy Race's graphics are very enjoyable and suit the style well.  Sound Extremely average, both the sound effects and music certainly aren't anything for your ears to bleed over, and yet they're not worth soiling your undies over, either.  With a music score that isn't anything new to the genre, let alone gaming at all, you probably won't even notice what kind of happy tune is playing in the background.  Bomberman Fantasy Race doesn't have much new in the audio department, so don't expect sound sensations that will take you aback in disbelief.   The sound, similar to the music, doesn't stand out from the crowd whatsoever.  With basic explosions, wacky noises, and so forth, nothing really grabs and violently shakes your attention to the point where you actually notice the sounds themselves.  Like the graphics, they fit the situation perfectly and add to the cartoonish effect of the already-strange, yet fun racer. All in all, Bomberman Fantasy Race was an enjoyable game. Although it doesn't add much new to the crowded genre, it's nice to see that there are titles out there which are fun to play regardless of cuteness or overused characters.  Every single day it appears that more and more unnecessary racers throw themselves into a massive heap of games few people should glance at, and it's at least a little refreshing to see one that turns out to be worthy of actually touching. Although it lacks a speedy adrenaline rush, and it doesn't push technical limits to the top, Bomberman Fantasy Race is a good time. No, you don't get to butcher monkies with a red-hot poker, and you certainly don't get to hit Leonardo DiCaprio in the neck with a foldable chair, but you'll enjoy the game nonetheless.  And why not?  Hell, it's Bomberman we're talking about after all! Bomberman's games is fun, nuff said.", "date": "Aug 5, 1999"}
