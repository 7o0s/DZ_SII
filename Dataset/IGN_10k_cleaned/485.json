Digital Eclipse is generally the right development company to go to when it comes to classic ports, but something went wrong here. Marble Madness was a great original arcade title, but on the Game Boy Color it's a rushed wanna-be. Features Six levels Digitized audio from the arcade Only for Game Boy Color  Marble Madness on the Game Boy Color is a conversion of a fantastic 1985 arcade game -- take control of a marble, racing the clock to get the ball to the goal. Six levels cut across bridges, slopes, stone mazes, and mechanical waves, and obstacles like vacuums, slime-eaters, acid pools and enemy marbles try to make your spherical life a living hell. When you get to the goal, the time left on the clock is carried over to the next level. If you can get through all six levels with time to spare, you win the game.  Marble Madness is another one of those classic arcade ports that proves Digital Eclipse isn't an infallible Game Boy Color developer. Sure, they've put out awesome coversions of arcade titles like Joust/Defender, Rampart, and Klax, but this is just an example where even they can't seem to get it right on a system they're most comfortable with. Marble Madness on the Game Boy Color may look a lot like the arcade, but it feels and plays like it was rushed to make the Christmas deadline.  Each of the original game's six levels are here and represented accurately on the Game Boy Color  the surrealistic, grid-style design of the slopes and platforms have been converted quite nicely from the higher-resolution arcade game to the limited Game Boy Color LCD screen. The problem here lies in the fact that the developer just didn't tweak how the marble should react to walls or objects when they collide. Or, at least how the marble reacted to walls and objects when they collided in the arcade version  if you've played the game in the arcade, you'll notice the marble doesn't have anywhere near the same physics on the Game Boy Color version.  And the title has a serious slowdown problem in later levels for some odd reason, not a good sign with a game that doesn't have that many moving objects on-screen. Hell, I even ran into a serious bug where I found myself lodged into a wall where I shouldn't have been, unable to get myself free without letting time run out or turning off the system.  Worse yet, Marble Madness on the Game Boy Color was to have two player support just like the arcade. But at the last minute, this feature was pulled. Strike another one against the game for not being arcade faithful  the game was great fun seeing who can get to the finish first, while trying to knock each other off the ledge. Without this mode, it kills the game's longevity  Marble Madness is only six levels long, after all. In theory you can beat the game in mere minutes.  Marble Madness is definitely among my Top Ten arcade games, so to see the score I gave this Game Boy Color conversion has to tell you something about its quality. It may look like the original, it may sound like the original  but the playability of this port just shoots the development down the tubes. Add to this the fact that the two player mode was pulled at the last minute (I've got an early revision with the two-player option in the menu), and you've got a lackluster portable port of a great original. It's a damn shame.", "date": "Dec 4, 1999"}
