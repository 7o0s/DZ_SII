The dark, brooding, and clever books have been enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of readers, and now fans have a way to while away the time before the feature bows: JAMDAT's only cell game based on the movie.   Features:   5 missions  Play as all 3 Baudelaire orphans  Explore Count Olaf's mansion   Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is an adventure/puzzle hybrid of a game, where you take control of all three Baudelaire children -- and their individual talents. For example, Violet can invent things and can use her height to get things off shelves. Klaus is a serious reader and has enough strength to break objects, such as a table, should you need to. Baby Sunny has a powerful bite and can fit into small spaces.   You must use their talents in tandem to solve puzzle-based missions. This five-level game starts with all three children in the foyer of the run-down Olaf estate. The Count has given the orphans a list of chores, starting with cleaning the dirty dishes strewn throughout the house. The first order of business is to find all three sets of dirty dishes. However, with no soap, Violet must hunt down the ingredients necessary to make it: lard and lye   Once the soap has been made, the dishes can be cleaned and it's off to the next task at hand, making dinner for Olaf and his theater troupe. The children must find the ingredients for dinner, starting with pasta (which is hidden in the cupboard to the right of the fridge -- a little hint from yer friends at IGN).   While playing the game, you must explore the mansion, which is encouraged by assigning a little comment about every interactive object. When you can use an object, a yellow frame appears around it. To use the object, just walk into it. Should you require another child to use the object, pressing the action key switches the next orphan.   The multi-story mansion is a decent size. And not all of it can be explored right from the get-go. Should you attempt to head upstairs while collecting dirty dishes, Olaf will instruct you to stay downstairs and slave away.   If there's one thing Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events really has going for it, its a grim sense of humor. And thankfully, JAMDAT's game has picked up on that. The delightfully dry Violet has her little asides, baby Sunny spouts nonsense when selected, and the household item descriptions are smart. For example, when you walk up to a pile of rocks in the kids' bedroom, it's noted that's all Olaf gave them to play with.   The game play formula is tried-and-true, but well done. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is something of a challenge by your third activity. However, it's never too tough to figure out, making the game perfect for amusing younger players interesting in getting their mitts on your handset.   Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events looks nice enough. It's not the most advanced cell game we've ever played, but the overall lay-out of the mansion is smart and accessible. The childrens' sprites are all very different -- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny look nothing alike -- but they have pretty limited animation. When they talk, though, a dialogue window shows a scan of the actor's face. We were impressed to see Jim Carrey's mug show up, as sometimes big league actor-types don't cotton to appearing in vids.  Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events isn't breaking any boundaries, but it knows its formula and executes it very well. The puzzles are not brainbusters, but they will require a decent bit of exploration and problem-solving. What JAMDAT manages to really do, though, is nail the atmosphere of the books and movies -- which is always tantamount for a successful licensed game.If you're a fan of the books and looking forward to the upcoming film, this is a great download. However, if you have no feelings for the source material, the formulaic gameplay might not be your bag. However, this game is well-done enough that it may make you intrigued enough to lay down your $8 next month.", "date": "Nov 23, 2004"}
