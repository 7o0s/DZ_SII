While this travesty has become somewhat commonplace when referring to games based on television and movie properties, the South Park license is slowly turning the disappointment into an art form. The original first-person shooter on the Nintendo 64 was the first in a slew of misfired attempts that include licensed trivia sessions, lousy ports of the N64 game to other platforms, and a lackluster kart racer. Capturing Trey Parker and Matt Stone's hit comedy series successfully for a videogame continues to appear less and less likely. I was hopeful, though, when I learned that the previously-mentioned racer was being tweaked and improved upon for the SEGA Dreamcast. Maybe we'll get a good game out of this series after all?   Maybe not.   South Park Rally is undoubtedly one of the worst racing games I have ever played. Where to begin is almost as big a chore as completing the game itself. I suppose the humane thing to do would be to start with the horribly-designed multi-level tracks and terribly frustrating control issues -- which only begin to describe the problems here, and there are many.   To its credit, South Park Rally does try to be a bit innovative by straying away from the standard ~race around the track in circles~ formula by making each area open and fully explorable. But while the idea that you can go anywhere to get ahead in the race is a good one (and the bonus ~missions~ you have to complete instead of basic lap completion are intriguing), its falls apart nigh-immediately. The non-linear course structure creates an air of pure chaos, with each car going every which way but loose in a jumbled mess of confusion. Poorly designed and often repetitive, South Park Rally takes a solid concept and throws it down the river without a raft.   Don't worry Marvin, the gameplay is starvin' too. The aforementioned ~missions~ are more trouble than they're worth. Interesting goals like finding the antidote to Mad Cow disease and curing yourself before anyone else can or shooting people with Cupid's bow and arrow on Valentines Day are exercises in frustration. Each course's objective is long and difficult to enjoy, and are quickly exposed as the gimmicks they truly are. Plus, since there's no way to progress unless you take first place each time (that's right, second place isn't even an option), there's no room for error. Either you're perfect every time, or you lose -- that isn't very fun on tracks that don't exactly make it clear what it is you're supposed to be doing.   The game's absolute worst element, though, has to be its control. It's the epitome of ass. Sloshy, wayward responsiveness and far too sensitive brakes keep you jumping, stopping and jumping again through nearly every turn. Taking into consideration that these are supposed to be professionally-designed race tracks, the ~get and go~ method of punching the gas and brake methodically is entirely unacceptable. Plus, why is it damn-near impossible to make a U-turn without having to stop completely? I just don't get it.   The power-ups and bonuses don't do much for the entertainment value either. While some overzealous South Park denizens may take pride in knowing that both diarrhea and vomit can be used as weapons, most of us will recognize that it's the same scheme we've seen a thousand times before in a new guise. Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo will make you invincible to any attack? Great, who cares?   Diehard fans of the series might be able to overlook these shortcomings when they learn that there is damn near 30 selectable characters and almost 10 tracks to choose from. They may also take comfort in learning that Stone and Parker themselves did the voices for all your favorite South Park personalities. But even those little points of light can't save the cold hard fact that in the great race for suckitude, South Park Rally takes first place every time -- not second, there is no second!Aimed at the legion of South Park faithful, South Park Rally will probably sell a zillion copies, leaving the window open for continued baboon droppings that claim to be worthy of the more-than hilarious television show. But that's only true if you're a strong supporter of recycled track design and terrible gameplay. Those of you who aren't out to punish yourselves need not apply.", "date": "Jul 6, 2000"}
