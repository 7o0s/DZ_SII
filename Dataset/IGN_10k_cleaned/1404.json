Developers and publishers like Gremlin, SCi, Ocean, and DMA Design were  either gobbled up by larger corporate entities, left to languish in  never-never land, or downscaled to the point that they might as well be  invisible to the market now.  It was in this unfavorable climate that the  Bitmap Brothers, makers of the acclaimed Chaos Engine and Z series,  disappeared off the radar too.  Many said this British outfit had folded out  of necessity, others that they'd simply given up the will to continue into  the next age.  Yet here we stand, at the dawn of a new millenium, face to  face with old friends bearing gifts of forgiveness.   Gameplay First, the Bitmap Brothers deserve a warm welcome back from the brink  of death. It's good to see that in addition to dusting off their own hides,  company execs have also shined up Speedball, a venerable old classic, in  preparation for a second shot at the big time.  Once a cult favorite that  was displayed in less colors than a homemade fanzine, the product's now  sporting jazzy 3D duds and oodles of expanded league options, plus a touch  of the PlayStation's signature playability.  And thankfully the creative  minds haven't changed the formula much since the days of the Amiga.   In all honesty, this new game really boils down to an upgrade, not a revision or sequel. Athletic teams still enter futuristic arenas and attempt to score goals when they aren't pounding the snot out of each other.  Three dimensional graphics won't disrupt your feelings of deja vu; the playing field is observed from a fixed, overhead view.  True to its roots, Speedball 2100 is basically the same old game of full contact handball grown-ups left behind with their  childhood.   Do yourself a favor and ignore the complicated league options.  Player  management and team customization affect little and are infinitely more  trouble than they're worth.  Smart players head straight for a knockout  tournament, cup mode, exhibition, or versus match.  This title's strength  lies in its bare bones playability, not high level configurations of  statistical management.  Which is best considering how dumbed down the  gameplay really is.   Eighteen men step onto field, but they won't all be walking off.  Each will  bulldoze opponents down elbow-first to get control off the ball.  Nothing's  stopping them from running willy-nilly toward score multipliers, bonus  stars, or team goals besides a roomful of vicious brawlers.  The only time  macho men relinquish possession is to pass the projectile or slam it against  the wall in hopes the ricochet will prove more useful to their team than a  straightforward run for the money.   That said, it's a good idea to collect power-ups and coins as they appear.   Players who lose too much health and don't grab a first aid icon not only  get carted off to the morgue, they also land the opposition extra points and  bragging rights.  Speed symbols can help you avoid this fate by bestowing  turbo boosts onto teammates that pick them up.  Other beneficial effects of  special items include competitor paralysis and collectable cash bonuses  (used to purchase enhanced fodder for team lineups).  Only a fool neglects  objects such as these, which can easily tip the balance of a match due to  the event's frenzied pace.   The game's own shallowness does this game in eventually, though.  While  fast, frenetic competition's great on a short term basis, you won't stick  with it for long when viewed from a grand scale.  Wicked multiplayer  confrontations and the title's coffee break play sensibilities do boost the  replay value.  But as a solo diversion, Speedball 2100 fails to successfully  bring the pain for more than a day or two, due to its painfully simple  design tenets.   Graphics Light years beyond the original artwork.  Speedy, fluid animation makes the  game a pleasure to watch.  Hits look hard, the action seems frenetic, and  everything's as it should be.  Except for the fact that the title's going to  appear outdated by modern standards.  Dark, washed out texture patterns and  grainy menu screens aren't going to draw new players into the fold.  Fans of  the original shouldn't have many complaints, but to the untrained (read:  inexperienced Speedball freak) eye, more eye candy is a necessity.  Luckily  the consistently high frame rate ought to silence most critics' rumblings  until a sequel's been produced.   Sound Score another blow for the Bitmap Brothers. A smackdown sounds like, well,  a smackdown. Assorted grunts, moans, groans and gasps are mixed in for  seasoning. Constant ambient effects like crowd cheers, metallic pings, and  kaboom noises also mingle on the airwaves.  Unfortunately, there's no music,  which makes menu surfing tedious.  But the audio production's very  workmanlike as pseudo-sports games go. This title reeks of European roots.  Even if you didn't know the product's history, it's not hard to divine its lineage from the cryptic, low-res Amiga-esque presentation.  But the playability's dead on.  Tune in to exhibitions, two-player slugfests or knockout tournaments in lieu of the unfriendly management options and you'll be thrilled with the game's classic approach to sporting association sanctioned anarchy.  Although not a bruiser you'll seriously consider for a lengthy relationship, Speedball 2100 is an ideal partner for the few minutes of bliss one can steal with their computerized loved ones while on break.", "date": "Oct 26, 2000"}
