{"name": "3D Pool Urban Hustle", "name_review": "3D Pool Urban Hustle", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/19/3d-pool-urban-hustle", "text": "I-play released the original 3D Pool back when the mobile maker was still known as Digital Bridges. It was a solid pool game that hung most of its hopes on 3D, which was then more of a marketing tool than a game play enhancement. In the last year, though, I-play has made some solid improvements to the game -- including the 3D -- and retitled the game Urban Hustle, thank to its minor story about working your way through the underground pool scene.   Urban Hustle offers multiple play modes, such as Quick Play, which just lets you get started on a game. There are three types of pool in Urban Hustle: UK 8 ball, US 8 ball, and US 9 ball. The Single Player mode dumps you into the tournament scene, where you go from pool hall to pool hall, challenging a series of hustlers and entering trick shot contests. This mode is where players will find the majority of Urban Hustle's ~meat.~ There are literally dozens of matches to play across the various match types, and the more you win, the more money you earn. Conversely, if you lose a match, your pocketbook takes a hit. The game also includes a pass-the-phone two-player game.   Ball physics either make or break a pool game, and Urban Hustle clears this hurdle with no problems. Lining up shots feels right, thanks to simple controls and cooperative camera angles (you can go 3D or use a top-down camera), and when you do finally let 'er go, the balls appear to behave appropriately. You can put English on your shots to pull off some tricky plays, adjust the power, and swivel all around the table to find that perfect shot. The only time constraint is your battery life.   Urban Hustle definitely looks better than its predecessor. The camera in 3D mode is certainly smoother, and that means a lot to anybody that tried out the original. The game is more colorful, too, and the story mode offers up some character portraits and different locales.  Urban Hustle is more than just a re-skinning of the original 3D Pool. The new single player story mode gives the game more depth, and thusly, more value. The improvement on the camera control and 3D is also quite welcome, as is just the general assurance that these balls are behaving as balls should. (Geometrically, pervert.) if you're looking for a solid mobile pool game, Urban Hustle is a pretty good download.", "date": "Nov 19, 2005"}
