With all of the NBA games, including EA Sports' NBA Live 2001, Konami's ESPN NBA 2Night, and 989's own NBA ShootOut 2001, not due out until the first quarter of next year, PS2 owners looking to play a basketball videogame on their newly purchased system will have to either pick up Final Four or just wait a month or more for the NBA games to make it onto store shelves.   Accordingly, the question that is likely on the minds of most basketball videogame aficionados is, should I pick up NCAA Final Four 2001 for my PS2 now or should I wait a month or two and see how the NBA games turn out? The answer to this question will ultimately depend on what exactly you're looking for in the game and whether or not you're looking for an NBA game, an NCAA game or just any basketball game. If it's the college game that you're looking for, then this is your only option this year, but if you're looking for pro hoops or any five-on-five basketball game, then the smart choice would be to wait and see how the other games turn out because this one has its fair share of flaws.   Gameplay   One of the game's problems is that it contains the bare minimum number of features and gameplay modes. It has your basic Quick Start, Exhibition, Season, Tournament and Arcade play modes, but it doesn't have any sort of dynasty or career mode that has become a staple in college sports videogames and is even featured prominently in 989 Sports' own PS2 college football game. The absence of this feature takes away a tremendous amount of value from the game and its omission is perplexing considering how easy it would have been to put it into the game.   Final Four 2001's deficiencies can also be seen in its lack of customizable features. While the difficulty level can be adjusted to four different levels, Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior, and the speed of the game can be slowed down or sped up by numerous incremental levels, things like the frequency of blocked shots, steals, and the like cannot be touched. 989 Sports was one of the first companies to include such a high level of customization in its sports games, as seen first in its GameDay series, so you really have to wonder why it isn't something that has made an appearance in any of its basketball titles.   Luckily, things get a little bit better once you step onto the court. Even on the default speed setting, Final Four 2001 is one of the fastest moving basketball games on any system. Player movement is very responsive and there are a multitude of moves that can be performed. Users can execute just about everything that can be done in real-life basketball including pump fakes, ally oops, jump passes, fade-aways, and a variety of special moves like between-the-leg and behind-the-back dribbles. Likewise, the game also makes use of Icon Passing, Icon Cutting, and Icon Screening, which are advanced control mechanics that makes it easier to pass to particular teammates, have them cut to the basket or order them to set a pick with very little effort on the part of the game player.   Another nice ability is being able to automatically cover a defender by pressing and holding down the triangle button. While doing this, your defender will cover his particular assignment and will try to stay between him and the basket at all times. Simply using this won't get you anywhere as he won't attempt any steals or try to block any shots, as you'll have to do that yourself, but it does keep your defender in a good position at all times.     The mechanics for shooting the ball is basically on par with what we've been offered in 989 Sports' previous basketball titles with players being offered to either use the Touch Shooting meter or the standard shoot at the top of the jump mechanics. While the Touch Shooting meter is a great idea, it needs to evolve a bit more before it can be considered a worthwhile feature. As is, the meter makes it way too easy to hit three point attempts with good shooters once you get used to the pace of the meter on the first three difficulty settings and doesn't seem to give players enough room for error on easy inside shots on the Senior level.   Even with all of the moves and the high level control available to the user, the game still lacks some key elements that are a natural part of the real sport. The inside game is limited, as there aren't really any controllable moves in the post. Additionally, rebounding is much more difficult than it really should be because it's a major pain in the ass to actually time your jump correctly and position your player for a rebound. Ironically, one of the game's biggest plusses is that it features advanced ball physics, which allows for a greater variety in the way that the basketball will bounce off of the rim and backboard. And while this is definitely a good thing because it brings the game closer to reality, it makes rebounding even more difficult because trying to time your jump correctly when you know where the ball is coming is already quite tedious, and not knowing where it's bouncing makes it even more of a chore.   Oddly enough, the problem with rebounding being a little more difficult than it should doesn't really come into play as much as one would think. This is largely because there are so few missed shots in the game. Whether on the Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or Senior difficulty levels, players can expect the computer to shoot in the 75% to 85% range with the majority of misses being either blocked shots or full court field goal attempts. The computer will rarely miss a shot that's not blocked and the only way to really stop the computer on any of the game's difficulty levels is to either steal the ball or block a shot.   This is where a lot of the game begins to fall apart. On the Freshmen and Sophomore levels, it's just way too easy to steal, while on the Junior and Senior levels it's much harder to steal the ball and any failed steal attempts on the defensive half of the court will typically result in the CPU controlled player driving right pas you for an easy dunk. Although, this would seem like a good feature, as it's an effective way to keep players from simply repeatedly pressing the steal button, it's just not handled well because of problems with the AI of your computer controlled teammates. In a real-life situation, when a player gets past a defender after a failed steal attempt, it's customary for one of the defender's teammates to help out and cover the man heading towards the basket -- this doesn't happen in Final Four 2001. Nine times out of 10, when in this situation, your teammates won't do anything and the computer will have an open lane to the basket for an easy dunk.   Another problem with the game is that there's just too many fouls called on the computer on straight up jump shot attempts by the player. On more than half of all blocked shots by the computer, there will be a foul called that will send the player to the line. And while this percentage may or may not be truthful, the computer will block an tremendously high number of shots in the game, so there will in turn be an excessive amount of fouls called throughout a contest.   Graphics  Visually, Final Four 2001 does bring to the table plenty of elements that weren't offered in previous generation efforts, but comes up a bit short when you compare it to the only other next-generation basketball games on the market, primarily Sega's NBA2K and NBA2K1 on Dreamcast. While the edges of the players and the general image of the court and environments appear a bit sharper and of a higher quality in Final Four, it's inferior to the Dreamcast game in the areas of player animation and the texture quality of the player models.   That's not to say that the graphics are bad in NCAA Final Four 2001, as they're not. The game just doesn't look better than what we've already seen on a comparable next-generation system. For instance, while there are more than 1,000 motion captured moves in the game and the game moves at a silky smooth 60 frames per second with no apparent slowdown, the player movement seems choppy and unrealistic at times because the interpolation between moves is severely lacking and there's not any animation for the rim or backboard, so big slam dunks don't feel as powerful as they should.   Even though the game does have its problems in the area of visuals, Final Four 2001 does, however, boast plenty of nice little extras that definitely help make it more than just a high-resolution PlayStation game. Player models are quite varied in height, shape and size, and they each have plenty of cool details such as T-shirts under the jerseys, varied sock lengths, tattoos on players' arms, and different hair styles and face textures.   The same can be said about the arenas and general background elements in the game, which are both quite detailed and include an ample amount of moving objects that help bring them to life. In addition to the standard animated 2D members of the crowd, many of the spectators in the front rows are actually fully 3D polygonal models that move around, get stand up and sit down and cheer differently. Likewise, the game has polygonal players on the bench, and coaches and referees that walk around the sidelines and the court.   While these things have been seen in other games, Final Four 2001 does offer at least one element that's not in any other basketball title that we know of -- 3D polygonal cheerleaders. Yes, that's right. Final Four 2001 has cheerleaders that will sit at both ends of the court and will cheer and move around during the game. And when there's a timeout, the cheerleaders will run to the center of the court and will do a cheer until you press the button. It's more of a novelty than anything, but it's nice to see that someone is looking at bringing stuff like this back into sports gaming. Even though it's not going to make or break a game, it would be cool to see things like half-time shows and end game celebrations become more apart of the games again.   Sound  Much like the graphics, the sound in Final Four 2001 offers a mixture of good and bad. On the good side, the quality of the sound samples is pretty high, as the cheering of the crowds, the clapping, booing, etc, sounds crisp, clear and quite realistic and the same can be said of the sound of the ball bouncing off of the floor, rim or backboard, as well as the squeaks of the shoes of the court. The game also sports many authentic fight songs from schools like University of Notre Dame and players have the ability to get the crowd going by using the game's special 6th man option.   The problem is that while the general quality of the sound samples are good and varied, they're not really used effectively. The crowd never gets as noisy and hectic as they do in real college basketball games, even when using the 6th man feature, and the chants and fight songs are used too infrequently. While it's not horrible by any means, the sound just comes up short when it comes to bringing home the authentic collegiate atmosphere.  NCAA Final Four 2001 isn't  horrible and if you must have a college basketball videogame, it's definitely worth giving a look, if only because of the fact that it's the only one for any next-generation system, but it's far from good. The game suffers from way too many AI and gameplay problems to be something that we could recommend, though, and the lack of key features that have become a staple in sports games, like a Dynasty mode, really hurts its overall value and appeal.", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
