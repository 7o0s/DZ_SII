The firm turned to Torus Games to develop a first-person shooter that would shame anything available on the Game Boy Advance or that could be downloaded from any carrier. And now we finally see the fruits of Ashen's long gestation period.   Features:   Story-driven first-person shooter  Nine weapons  Eight levels  Nine monster types   You are Jacob Ward, plunging headfirst into Seven River City to find your sister. The gothic metro is under assault from an ugly demon horde, and there's a god chance your sister had more than a little something to do with it, but as her brother, you are duty-bound to help her out. If fighting off hellspawn in a crumbling bizarro landscape isn't love, then what is?   Ashen finally answers the question on everybody's tongue: What if a horde of demons invaded the world and nobody bothered to show up? In the beginning, when a game needs to truly hook you, Ashen disappoints. Exploring is slow and methodical, and monster encounters are to few and far between.   Now, these problems are rectified as you progress further into the game and start meeting even more of the game's infernal cast, such Aquagores and Wraiths. These are somewhat terrifying creatures that you would expect out of a creepy-crawly blaster. We say ~somewhat~ becuase their pixilated nature -- a minor drawback of the QD's already outdated tech - manages to minimize some of their impact.   Ashen finds a clever way to side step this problem by rendering many of the game's beasties invisible. Ripping pages from ~From Beyond~ and ~They Live,~ you must don your sister's Ghost Vision Goggles to spy the spectral evil. These goggles have a limited power supply that must be recharged, so you can only glimpse these horrors briefly. It's a cool concept, but the goggles lose their juice so quickly that you will often be forced to shoot into the ether and pray you hit something. And, well, that ain't much fun.   Ashen's control scheme covers almost the entirety of the QD's face, using practically every number key to perform actions like shoot, strafe, jump, and cycle through your weapons. It take some serious playtime to get truly familiar with the controls, which aren't bad, but Torus must have considered the possibility that it is unnecessarily complicated.   It does help that shooting is very forgiving. There is a slight element of auto-aim that relieves the inaccuracy associated with controlling a FPS with a directional pad instead of a mouse and keyboard combo. The weapon count in Ashen is varied, including sniper rifles, gattling guns, grenade launchers and alien pulse pistols.   Ashen looks pretty good. It's certainly seven steps above previous N-Gage games, but coming off of E3's glimpse at the PSP and Nintendo DS, it's hard to get excited about such a pixilated shooter. The framerate is low, but steady. However, Torus does have a gifted art team, able to design great looking environments. Ashen almost deserves to be seen on a console or PC so you can really appreciate the design.   Where Ashen truly excels is in sound. The QD speakers don't exactly pump out thrilling amounts of audio, but if you plug in headphones, you'll really get into the game's soundtrack. The dynamic music changes depending on how freaky the situation is, especially when the ghosts close in.   Ashen supports four-player deathmatches over Bluetooth, which is a far more welcome feature than the weak ~upload your ghost file~ attempts at multiplayer by earlier games.  Ashen is one of the best N-Gage games available on the market, but I'm not convinced it's enough to make gamers wary of Nokia's game deck take the plunge. However, if you already own an N-Gage or were planning to get a QD for its excellent phone capabilities, Ashen is a good, moody shooter.", "date": "Jul 27, 2004"}
