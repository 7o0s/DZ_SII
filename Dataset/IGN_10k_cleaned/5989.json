Glu's Blackjack Hustler concentrates on the quickest of card gambling games: 21. However, since a simple blackjack sim would have the depth of a mud puddle, the studio has devised a career mode to keep gamers interested.    While you can certainly just jump right in and start slapping 'em down with the dealer, the meat of Blackjack Hustler comes from creating an in-game avatar (select from a variety of models) and following through a sort of story mode. Proving yourself in various gaming houses opens up new challenges. From a city map, you move your character between home (sleep and check messages), the bank, and games. The better you are at hustling, the more money you make. Pretty soon, all of the big fish on the circuit will want a piece of your action.   This career mode is a welcome addition to the card game genre, as it gives you a reason to keep coming back. While I certainly did not develop any sort of emotional attachment to the game, I did enjoy watching the ebb and flow of my bank account for a while.   Eventually, though, even the career stuff gets a little old and you may find yourself doing what I did -- making stupid bets just to see what would happen. After all, it's fake money -- so why not bet the maximum and see if you can double it? What's the worst thing that could happen? My career craps out? That's when I switched back to the quick games of 21 before eventually just deleting the game to make room for another game.   Blackjack Hustler is a very clean-looking game. The game are easy to read, the character designs are good (I liked the 80s Tom Selleck guy), and the map screen is simple to navigate. The game does include a nice spot of audio, too.Blackjack Hustler is a good game for the card-playing set, especially if you already like 21. The career mode gives the game a little juice, but even that will eventually run dry for most players. I think the problem is not necessarily the game Blackjack Hustler, but the game of 21. It's just so fast -- the strategy is practically nil once you figure out when to hit, stand, and split. And while that's certainly fun enough for a night in Vegas or an evening with friends, it doesn't keep a mobile game cooking for long enough. If you don't mind knowing that the shallowness of Blackjack Hustler will set in soon, though, it is a good replication of 21 and will serve your purposes well enough.", "date": "Sep 7, 2005"}
