When another match three game shows up to the party, it's tempting to give it dirty looks and whisper insults behind its back.  But, there is a reason match three games continue to appear and remain popular: the system works.  As these things go, Super Collapse 3 is just different enough to stand on its own and offers plenty of variety that should keep you puzzled for a while.   The idea here is to clear groups of colored blocks (at least three at a time) and prevent the ever-rising rows from reaching the top of the screen.  As you clean the screen, any blocks that were above a group will fall and create new patterns.  Super Collapse 3 takes this simple formula and spreads it across several different game types and a lengthy Quest mode.  The Quest will take you through ten areas such as Fledgling Fields and Aqualand.   ~Classic mode~ is the basic game, as described above.  ~Relapse~ sends blocks from the top and bottom of the screen, and in an apparent critique on the notion of compromise you must prevent them from meeting in the middle.  ~Strategy~ introduces a new row of blocks every time you clear a group.  ~Slider~ constantly shifts rows from side to side so that groups are always changing.  There are a few other modes you'll encounter as you make your way through the Quest game.  Once they've been unlocked, you can play them anytime from the Quick Play menu.  Unlocking game types is a nice incentive to work though the Quest game, and they are mostly opened earlier in your adventure so you are rewarded frequently.   Generally, there will be a quota of lines you must survive in order to continue. Items add another facet of gameplay to Super Collapse 3.  During play, these power-ups will randomly appear to aid in your screen-clearing endeavors.  There is a Super Bomb that can be used to explode surrounding blocks; a Row bomb that removes an entire row; an Hourglass that stops time and prevents new rows from appearing shortly.  These and others can be bought at the Shop in Quest mode to be used as you see fit.  As you win rounds, you'll be paid with cash to be spent at these mom-and-pop stores.   In higher levels, redundantly-titled Blocking Blocks will appear which cannot be cleared in the traditional manner.  Only a Super Bomb can fell this foe.   A versus multiplayer mode can be played with the Classic, Relapse, Strategy, and Slider game types over either Wi-Fi or ad hoc.  Competition plays out like Tetris in that each player is working on their own screen and if they clear enough blocks, a row will be sent over to their opponent.   The music in Collapse 3 is surprisingly good, reminding me of early electronica like Kraftwerk or even budding Aphex Twin.  The sound effects can get in the way, though.  Luckily, you can turn down the effects from the options menu and focus on the ambient/electro tunes.  The overall game presentation is less inspired, showcasing bright and colorful graphics that lack any personality.Super Collapse 3, if not terribly exciting, offers a solid puzzle experience.  A longish Quest mode and lots to unlock offer an extended single-player experience.  And the music is great.  The multiplayer game is bare bones, though.  While Collapse is fun, it lacks the addictive qualities of some of the other match three games.  But for $19.99, this is one puzzle fans might want to clear some room for.", "date": "Oct 24, 2007"}
