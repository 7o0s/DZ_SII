We play Picross DS. In fact, we've been playing it since its Japanese debut, thanks to wonders of region-free cart fun. That's not to brag about our hardcore import credentials though - simply to illustrate how shockingly addictive Nintendo's latest puzzler is.   Chances are you won't have the faintest idea what Picross is though. Not through any fault of your own, mind - just that Nintendo hasn't done much to promote its long-running puzzle franchise outside of Japan. Out east, the series has already seen Mario's Picross, Mario's Super Picross, and NP Picross (across numerous volumes) on all manner of platforms, while the only entry in the series to hit the west was Mario's Picross - met with delirious indifference on its release in 1995. It's a bit of a shame really, given the vice-like addictive qualities squeezed into each iteration of the game. Jazz hands to the heavens for the arrival of Picross DS in Europe then, with one or two very mild reservations.    First though, a quick intro for those at the back: Picross (that's Picture Crossword, if you must) puzzles take the form of a blank grid - in this case ranging from 5x5 squares to the ridiculously sized - and your task is to create simple images using your powers of logic and deduction. To aid your progress, each row and column is annotated with a series of numbers - these represent the sequence of unbroken squares in each line. Obviously, it's your job to use logic and work out where they are, shading them in on the grid accordingly. So, for instance, ~3, 4, 6~ indicates that row contains continuous blocks of three squares, four squares and six squares in that order - the only proviso being there must be at least one empty square between each sequence.   It's ultimately one of those things that are far trickier to explain than to play. Thanks to the numerous tutorials though, you're up and running with Picross DS in no time. The tough bit though, is trying to explain exactly why Picross is so phenomenally engrossing. Perhaps it's the way your black and white scrawl magically forms into a delightfully animated image if you manage to complete a puzzle within the time limit or, alternatively, it might be the incredibly well judged difficulty curve - guaranteeing that you're always developing your deduction skills at the perfect pace, so that puzzles are always satisfyingly challenging, but never teeth-grindingly difficult.   Puzzles are split into themes reflecting the final puzzle image.   Of course, it might just be the sheer wealth of options crammed into Picross DS. Really, it's one of the most comprehensive packages we've yet seen on the handheld. While everything you'll find on the cart revolves around the basic Picross puzzle formula, you can take your pick from Normal mode and Free mode for starters. Normal mode awards a time penalty for every ill-deducted mistake you make (correcting your errors in the process) meaning that, while puzzles can still be completed, you won't get your icon animating with gay abandon if you stumble over the one hour time limit. Free mode, however, is more for the Picross connoisseur - make a mistake and the game won't bat a pixilated eyelid. Instead, you're left to carry on regardless, with a single unnoticed error driving you further and further into unsalvageable depths.     We could pretend we're even close to completing all the puzzles in Picross, but we're not. They're conveniently split into themes ranging from musical instruments, insects, birds, and accessories to space stuff, fish and flowers - each offering a progressively larger grid and tougher challenge. Rest assured, there are literally hundreds to sink your teeth into - and that's not even accounting for the handful of simple touch-based mini-games requiring block poking and image duplication. Nor, for that matter, does it include Daily Picross mode - offering a Brain Training-style performance measurement system based on a variety of tasks, such as completing five puzzles in the fastest time possible. Then there's My Picross, featuring a comprehensive puzzle designer, with your own creations shareable via the game's Puzzle Exchange, plus hundreds of downloadable Picross puzzles, all gleaned from previous titles in the Nintendo series. Finally, there're a handful of online multiplayer modes, all variations of the basic puzzle concept, if you fancy testing your Picross prowess against the great unwashed via Nintendo's Wi-fi Connection service.    Needless to say, there's plenty to keep you occupied and, thankfully, the game's implementation is almost flawless. We say 'almost' because we do have some minor quibbles with stylus control. It's certainly not horrible by any means - it's just a little more cumbersome than we'd like. Logically, filling in blocks and crosses simply require a prod of your stylus. However, continuously needing to switch between the two modes via the options in the top left of screen tends to break up the flow of each game somewhat.   Downloadable content and daily Picross increase longevity still further.   More problematically, larger multi-screen puzzles use the stylus to scroll across the grid too. It's a little too easy to accidentally prod the wrong place and garner a time penalty in the process - particularly aggravating given the stringent time limits in tougher puzzles. Still, any issues we might have with the stylus are quickly eliminated thanks to the sensible decision to include traditional button controls too. Frankly, using the d-pad to move around the grid, the A button to fill squares and the B button to plant crosses is a much smoother proposition and helps keep your problem-solving rhythm in check - definitely the control scheme of choice for Picross connoisseurs.As far as complaints go though, that's it - although it's perhaps fair to say you might want to turn the repetitive music off sooner rather than later. With the arrival of Picross DS, Nintendo's produced yet another practically faultless, top quality puzzler for its unstoppable handheld. Sure, with its minimalist visual styling and paper-based heritage, it's definitely one aimed at the growing army of 'casual' gamers. Don't let that put you off though - Picross DS is simply one of the most addictive, feature-packed timewasters out there. Your journeys into work might never be the same again.", "date": "May 18, 2007"}
