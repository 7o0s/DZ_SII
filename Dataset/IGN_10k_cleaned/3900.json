Daytona USA, Out Run, the original WipeOut. All considered classics. And then there's Super Sprint the staple of roller rinks across America. That four-wheeled friendship-killer.  Man, that was a great game -- and now it's back, sort of, thanks to cell game powerhouse JAMDAT.  Features: Twenty courses High score menu H-O-R-S-E-like side-game  JAMDAT Racing is a top-down racer of the first degree, offering you a birds' eye view of the entire track. It's up to you, and your nimble thumbs firmly hovering over the ~4~ and ~6~ keys, to bring it home for a victory lap. The action is fast and furious, despite the disconnect you'd expect to accompany such a faraway perspective. But that's the way Sprint was and it was a smash, so why shouldn't JAMDAT Racing follow suit?  There are twenty tiny courses for you to race and master, and it will take you quite a bit of time to work your way through them. You have a limited numbers of tries, and unless you finish first or second, you'll lose one. Lose all three and it's back to the beginning of the circuit.  Simple gameplay mechanics make JAMDAT Racing a winner, because it knows what a handset is capable of, and works within those boundaries. The visuals are just decent, but considering the speed and the dexterity it takes to motor around the tight turns, you'll have little time to be disappointed. You're too busy trying to make it to the next track, or collect the letters to spell JAMDAT. If you manage to nab all six, you get an extra life.  There are always four cars on the track, and you are always the red one. The interaction between the itty-bitty cars is amazing. There is actually quite a bit of AI involved, as cars will cut in front of you; and should one run into you hard enough, you spin out or slam into the wall. Because this is pure arcade racing, no need to worry about car damage, just time loss.  The tracks range from simple cakewalks to thumbnumbing thunder runs, trying to cruise through hairpin turns and avoid obstacles on the track, like piles of tires. Even though there are twenty tracks, none feel repetitive. There are overpasses and underpasses, crazy letter placements, and an endless number of turns.  One of the biggest wonders of JAMDAT Racing is the soundtrack. There is a nice handful of jingles that play over the racing, and they sound exactly like the MIDI-tunes you would hear from an eighties cabinet.  It fits perfectly, although we would have liked to have heard the whine and squeal of our little red corvette. A classic racer makes reappearance under another name, whether it wants to or not. JAMDAT Racing is a fun, clever, well-done little racer that is sure to steal more than few minutes of time per session. The visuals may not be spectacular, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. A very worthy download. Go get it. Now. I said, now.", "date": "Sep 10, 2003"}
