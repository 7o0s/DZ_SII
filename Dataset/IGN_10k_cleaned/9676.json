First, you need to evaluate each shot position based on lie, wind and distance to the hole. Second, you need the physical coordination to translate your evaluation into a good shot. PGA Championship Golf offers interesting ways to approach those problems in a computer simulation. The inclusion of various camera angles and the new TrueSwing virtual interface will help turn you from Putt-Putt weekender to a Ryder Cup contender. All it takes is a little practice and a lot of patience.  The swing interface is handled as if your mouse were your club head. You pull the mouse back to start your backswing. You push it forward to hit the ball. You can also choose to have the TrueSwing oriented horizontally if that's your thing, but the vertical method seems the more natural to me. The speed and angle of the forward push determines your shot. Although it took a while for me to adjust to this (I'm more familiar with the tri-click formula), I soon found it to be quite natural. Plus you can draw or fade the ball in very minute degrees just by moving the mouse to the left or right. It is possible to hit fairly accurate shots with this method but if you don't like it, there is a tri-click, power bar interface. The power bar has the advantage of showing you the degree of your shot's power-something you don't get with the TrueSwing.  But before you even step up to the ball, you should know a few things. Luckily all this information is provided for you in some handy, in-game displays. You see the distance to the hole, your lie, the slope of the lie and the wind speed and direction. You then select your club and adjust your stance to get the best possible conditions to get the ball onto the green. The caddy will take care of the club selection if you like. All you need to do then is adjust your aim and the power of your swing.  Before you hit the ball, you should also know what type of game you're playing. There are over ten here. You can play Medal (lowest overall score) or Match (most holes won). If that doesn't strike you, how about Stableford? In Stableford each hole score is assigned a point value-par is 0, birdie is 2, bogie is 1, etc. Each of those three modes has a corresponding team version as well. Or you can play Skins--basically a betting game. Don't like that? There's Scramble where a pair of teammates tee off simultaneously. They then both shoot two new balls from the shot that had the best lie. Then they pick the best of those two and shoot again. For those of you who understand the games, there're also Ryder Cup, Greensome and Bloodsome games.  Before you play though (boy, there sure are a lot of ~befores~ in this game), you have to create a golfer. Now maybe I'm a little square but I always respect player customization, especially the cosmetic aspects. You can choose from a lot of options in terms of player appearance. The only limitations are that the few dozen heads really do like an awful lot alike and the women are a little weird looking. You lefties will be sad to hear that there are no options for left handed golfers, despite the fact that Mike Jacobs, the producer at Sierra Sports, is a southpaw himself.  It seems as if the designers spent a lot of time looking in the wardrobe sections of many pro shops to come up with the patterns and designs. There's not a single outfit in the game that you would want to wear. Now that's authentic! You can pick different styles of pants and shirts and hats and shoes, and then you can pick patterns and colors. You can really get some great looking golfers here. I'm just sad that there's no big beret with the puffy ball on top of it.  You can also set the player's ability level. This includes setting the tees that golfer will use and setting the difficulty level for each shot. Higher difficulty results in longer potential drives, but they're harder to control. You also get to select the clubs you'll carry with you in the bag. I'm not big on this. Just make sure I have a driver and a putter and I'll manage. Those of you with more experience will want to choose your own clubs but you can elect to have the caddy do it for you. You can also set the ability levels of the computer players to a great degree. There are options for distance, accuracy, scrambling, scoring and so on. A computer player can also be set to ~learn~ as it plays.  There are a number of rules that you can mess with too. You can play in Tournament, Recreation or Practice modes. Tournaments are the way to go. You get big crowds (and the attendant noise) as well as shot by shot commentary by the golf announcers-Grant Boone and Mark Lye. For those of you who aren't into the whole purity thing (and I think you know who you are) you can select to play with mulligans, gimmies and pickups. Unfortunately, there's no season mode.  Once you've selected the game type and created your golfer, you're almost ready to play. Select one of the seven world class courses and then input the conditions for the day you're playing. You can make the green dry or wet and set the wind conditions. You'll also pick the rough length for the course. More important however is your selection of the course itself.  To go along with each of the seven courses is a short introductory film. It outlines the basics of the course and provides a real nice overview. These little video sequences are great by themselves and well worth watching. From the rugged challenge of Pasatiempo to the museum-like Pete Dye Golf Club, there's enough variety here to please most any golfer. The one English course, the Royal Birkdale, is one of the highest rated courses on earth. You can also play at Sahalee, Black Diamond Ranch and, my personal favorite, the Prince Course in Kauai.  If you don't like any of those courses, the Course Architect allows you to design your own. Seems pretty obvious. The problem here is that there's too much stuff here for it to be a practical interface. By the time you have the important windows open, you can't see a thing. To make it worse, the ground camera view window is too small to see anything to begin with. I have to say though, that anyone with the requisite patience will be able to create some spectacular courses with this tool. If it doesn't lock up every ten minutes, like it did with me.  You can create various land shapes and paths and hazards on your course. There are also literally hundreds of items that can be placed on the course, from camera boxes to ball washers. When I went to the GGO a couple of years ago, I actually got to see a real ball washer in action. Actually, I only got a glimpse of it. I think Michael Jordan was using it. Anyway, there're all sorts of trees and shrubs and little squirrels and signs that you can decorate your course with. You can also set their size. Want a 120' goose in the middle of the fairway? You can do it. Or make a course with trees all under 2' tall and pretend you're playing Giant Golf. That's really fun.  In a way, it's the inaccessability of these objects that ruined the Architect for me. It's just not convenient to place these items. And in order to place them, you have to open a whole new window. And I couldn't figure out how to place structures--like houses and bridges--to save my life. Luckily, I discovered a naturally growing antidote near my house so everything's okay now.  Controlling the shape of the holes is damned complicated too. My hat's off to the designers of the courses that ship with the game. If they created them with this Architect program, they deserve a raise. There are all sorts of rules as to how holes are laid out. Rules? What the hell? I don't want to design a realistic golf course for crying out loud! With that said, I also should let you know that a number of decent player designed courses are springing up online, so someone out there has the patience to work through it.  My other big gripe about this game is the lack of a reliable multi-play feature. Hotseat works fine if you don't mind switching seats--which I don't, by the way. Net play is supported by the World Opponent Network. I wasn't ever able to give it a try because downloading the update crashes my system. I know from some of the newsgroups that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. Maybe we're just cursed. Anyway, Sierra Sports has promised that we'll get a patch soon.  If you can't play the game on the multi-player server, then what's the point? I mean, golf is fun and all, but to me it's a social sport. Playing against the computer is only so satisfying. The fact that you can move around the course while other players are taking their shots had me very excited. Actually, it's not like you move around, you just jump from one place to the next, but it's still nice not to have to watch your opponents. Go ahead and start evaluating your own shot.  In terms of graphics and sound, PGA is one of the best golf titles I can remember. Each course is rendered down to the smallest detail. There are even reflections in the water. Often, in games like this, the crowd on the side of the green looks flat. Although the spectators are 2D objects, they look very, very real. And you can view the whole course from almost any camera angle. Best of all though are the golfer animations. Most of these you don't even control. The guys will adjust their pants or hat or scratch the back of their neck. It's these little extra touches that make the experience so real.  Still, PGA is a good game. It wasn't as buggy as some recent Sierra Sports titles (now, that's just unfair), but it wasn't as smooth an operation as I'd hoped. The TrueSwing is nice and I really hope it becomes the new interface standard. The big bonus is that you can chug a beer at every hole without having to worry about all that unnecessary and inconvenient walking around-or getting caught peeing on the fairway.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
