Not at clubs with beautiful women, of course, but in their darkened rooms, oftentimes completely alone. How can this be? Well, when Nintendo wasn't looking, there was a videogame dancing revolution. And revolution really is the right word. Konami's Dance Dance Revolution games, once a Japan-only addiction, have in more recent times swept through America, grabbing stateside gamers with locally popular music and the promise of multiplayer fun.   Perhaps just as importantly, girls tend to like these dance-crazy games, which means that nerds need not fear mockery when attempting to play them. And when we write 'nerds,' we mean us.  For all the reasons above, dancing has become a hot commodity on PlayStation 2 and Xbox. But for whatever unfathomable explanation, GameCube has been ignored. Until now, that is. Mad Catz, which is best known for its wide lineup of game peripherals, has developed and published MC Groovz Dance Craze for Nintendo's console. The title strives to be as hip and enjoyable as Konami's efforts, but only proves that it takes more than a flimsy dance mat and some old music to get the formula right.  The Facts   The first DDR-style game for GameCube Comes packed with a specifically created dance mat A host of semi-popular songs that are either outdated or from B-grade artists Four dance modes including Just Dance, Dance Together, Dance Face-off and Dance Workout Primitive graphic displays Two-player support Requires four memory blocks for saves   Let's Dance Try as you might, it's hard to completely hate the Dance Dance Revolution games. In fact, you're much more likely to love them, especially having put your feet on the dance mat for more than a couple of minutes. The concept behind them really boils down to a simple marriage of music and technology, and a realization by Konami (and later, other developers) that people like to dance. Let's face it: some people have no business on the dance floor -- we know because we are these people. But on the other hand, we'd wager that at one time or another everybody has wanted to dance. The DDR-style games enable even the squarest gamers out there to strut their stuff, and have fun doing it. Moreover, the successful DDR-style titles work because they consider the music and structure rhythm to the beats, allowing players to tap their feet on the dance mat accordingly. The end result is addictive.    MC Groovz is at first glance a competent DDR rip off. It has a wide number of songs from a handful of popular artists and it comes packed with a functioning dance mat. Despite a generic graphic interface that draws psychedelic, screensaver-style imagery, the familiar scrolling arrows are everywhere and waiting for your feet to stomp them out of existence. The problem with this Mad Catz-published effort, however, is that no thought has been put into matching the footwork to the music. Rather, the arrows don't appear to really move in accordance with the music, but merely scroll. In some cases, they keep scrolling even after a song has finished, which makes no sense whatsoever. Therefore, you'll never feel like you're really dancing to the music, but flailing your feet around to match some arrows; the music may as well be turned off, which incidentally is an option on the dance mat.  The criticisms raised above are already enough for us to recommend against this game and for waiting out Nintendo's own Dance Dance Revolution with Mario, which is scheduled to hit Nintendo's console later this year. But wait, there's more.  The song selection in MC Groovz is, shall we say, bad. It's particularly dated, actually. Sure, there are songs from Jessica Simpson, Jewel and DJ Jazzy Jeff, but has anybody ever really wanted to boogey down to Parents Just Don't Understand? Meanwhile, if you happen to be more than 30 years old, you might appreciate the fact that the game also includes a track from KC and the Sunshine Band. Or maybe you're more into the cutting edge music of Patti Labelle and The Commodores? No? Well, how about Whodini? The list of hit-makers goes on, but we'll spare you. On a brighter note, there are some remixed songs from some respectable electronica artists like Ming+FS, but we expect that the typical track length of plus-five minutes will prove too daunting for most dancers anyway.     There are four different gameplay modes including a Dance Workout complete with a calorie counter, but with relatively broken dance mechanics to begin with, we can't think of too many reasons to explore them.   This is simply not a good DDR-style game, but we might have been able to overlook some of these flaws if the title at least sold for a cheap price. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The MC Groovz bundle retails for just as much as the good games.The videogame industry has undergone an interesting evolution, I think. I can remember back several years when bad games would receive ones, twos, and threes by reviewers. But today's ~bad games~ are more likely to draw 5s or 6s. Games as a whole have gotten better. So I have to give Mad Catz credit for trying to bring back a piece of the good old days.The simple truth is that the generic MC Groovz Dance Craze is a broken GameCube game. The dance work doesn't match with the music and therefore the title's dance challenges are not fun. Based on that alone, I'd be giving this sucker a big thumbs down if I were Roger Ebert, whom I incidentally strive to be, suit and all. But sadly, it gets worse because the music selection sucks, too. And to top it all off, this DDR rip-off with no soul costs just as much as today's cutting-edge GameCube titles.If you are a Dance Dance fan, wait for Nintendo's forthcoming DDR with Mario title. It's bound to be in a different league than this unfortunate effort.Do not buy.", "date": "May 5, 2005"}
