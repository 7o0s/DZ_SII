{"name": "Joint Operations: Escalation", "name_review": "Joint Operations: Escalation Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/24/joint-operations-escalation-review", "text": "When Battlefield 1942 came on the scene, there was nothing else quite like it--the vehicles and the scale were something else, and we lauded it with praise. However, the follow-ups, from DICE and its competitors, haven't quite captured the same magic. Most recently, we had Star Wars Battlefront, which was good but not great. The Star Wars aspect was great, but the gameplay wasn't solid across the board. Then came Joint Operations, which promised up to 150 players per server, on huge maps. It got a lot of things right, but the fun factor still fell a little short, thanks in part to things like generous sniper allowances, exposed spawn points, distant capture points, and no ability to simultaneously operate a vehicle and one of its weapons. Well, the Joint Ops: Escalation expansion has corrected many of these problems, but still suffers from a couple issues.  Escalation offers a host of new content, for one thing. Players in a helicopter who are about to get shot down have the option to equip themselves with parachutes, making the endeavor much less risky. The average JO heli pilot tends to fly right over an enemy base, instead of flying low and landing at the fringe, even though the twin chainguns are designed more for defense than offense. However, the falling rate of the chutes is pretty slow, making it more of a last-ditch effort to stay alive than a viable insertion tactic, unless you come in fast and hard before the defenders know what's up.  There's also body armor and three different types of ammunition for what Novalogic describes as a ~rock-paper-scissors~ system. Armor piercing rounds take care of armor, but FMJ and soft point do little damage. Conversely, soft point and FMJ are effective against unarmored infantry. Both your rifle and sidearm can be separately equipped. Both sides have the G-3 and P90 SMG, the JO team has the G-36 and MK-23 pistol, and the Rebels get the FN-FNC and Glock 17. The G-36 is a new favorite of mine, as it has good accuracy, stopping power, and a basic scope.    The new vehicles are more important here, and both sides get battle tanks, attack choppers and dirt bikes. Although the JO guys technically have an Abrams and the Rebels get a T-80, they're functionally identical. As with the original game, the pilots cannot fire weapons. This is realistic, but it doesn't necessarily make it fun. Still, you can drive to a strategic point and switch to the cannon in the tank, which I've done a couple times to good effect. The driver has the best field of view, and the gunner can mark targets, but he's exposed. The cannon operator has the beefy gun, but rotation time is relatively slow, as it should be.  The attack chopper can be devastating, and can take two Stinger missiles without going down (the most infantry can carry at one time), but it requires coordination with the pilot, since the chopper turret's rotational range is narrow. Although the tank can take a lot of punishment--two AT4 or RPG shots--it can be devastated by the new anti-tank mines (which will damage all vehicles, not just tanks). You can get close to the tank and circle around it, dropping the mines, and it's toast as soon as it moves.  The dirt bike is the real story, though, in my opinion. The physics are decidedly in arcade territory, but it's very effective for quickly buzzing over to the hot spot. The passenger can fire weapons, too. The bike is a very tough target to hit unless it's coming straight at you, and it's fun weaving in and out of the chaos, over hill and dale. If you hit a tree, though, you're as dead as if you were piloting a speeder bike.      Aiding the bike rider's ability to protect himself are some new limitations on snipers. There's now more scope drift, requiring you to lie prone for those snipe shots. Accuracy still appears to be spot-on, with the only trajectory factor being the arc, but the drift balances things out a lot. Most importantly, though, there are few of the round spawn point bunkers that were the mainstay of Joint Operations. Instead, you'll be spawning inside buildings or within some other protective framework. This introduces the new problem of an enemy being able to camp inside the spawn point, but they don't last nearly long as a sniper on a ridge a kilometer away.  The capture points have generally been pulled closer together, as well, making it possible to sometimes mount an effective assault on foot. Defenders also benefit from the new base defense gun, but it's usually only emplaced on the rear-most base.  There's still the problem of waiting to spawn, getting all the way over to the action, and getting clipped by someone out your field of view within a few seconds of arriving. Rifle accuracy seems to be a bit too forgiving, but maybe I've been playing too much Counter-Strike: Source lately. When a person is running lateral at more than fifty paces away, they shouldn't be able to cut you down as fast as they do.  In general, Escalation has gone a long way towards reducing the problems that made Joint Ops so aggravating sometimes. It's too bad that it doesn't run very smoothly. Even with a 6800GT OC, a gigabyte of 400MHz RAM, and a 3.0GHz P4, and a 3 megabit Internet connection, I had to tone down the visuals significantly. It didn't look anything like it does in the promo shots, but I eventually got it running smooth.  The JO games have a very distant clipping plane, and although Far Cry has proved that this is can be done, putting 149 other people in the game and making them play it over the Internet seems to strain the technology to its limits. JO also has some bad jaggies, and my 6800GT had spoiled me for smooth shininess that I just couldn't replicate here. Meanwhile, CS:S runs smooth as butter with significantly better eye candy.    Considering that there were nearly 100 people on some of the servers I played on, things were relatively smooth. But lag pops had a habit of teleporting me a few feet, instead of delaying my action. Sometimes it's the difference between being crouched safely behind and embankment and being exposed. Sometimes it's the difference between hitting a tree and flying right past it. That was only of the only glitches, though, the other being the timer on the armory. Once you've made your selections, you can't access it again for 30 seconds, which seems reasonable since it prevents you from firing off rockets or whatnot at a constant rate, but this timer sets itself even if you don't make any changes to your equipment, which is annoying, especially when the capture point is under attack.Although hit detection has been spread to body zones, making it so that a sniper can't shoot your foot and kill you, motion capture isn't as satisfying as ragdoll, especially after Painkiller, Half-Life 2, and CS: Source. You can blow people into the air with explosions, but there isn't the same sense of impact with bullets. In large-scale multiplayer gaming, this kind of thing probably has to suffice in order to keep the system from buckling, but the performance tradeoff leads to infantry combat that's a little underwhelming. All in all, Joint Ops and the Escalation expansion pack to a good job of feeding the BF1942 jones, but I still miss being able to drive and control a vehicle weapon at the same time. This wouldn't be realistic, but it is fun, and perhaps some more allowances need to be made in this regard for Escalation to truly capture the fun factor. The dirt bike is definitely a great example.", "date": "Nov 24, 2004"}
