{"name": "Torrente", "name_review": "Torrente", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/04/torrente", "text": "As you can imagine, here at IGN we see hundreds of games each year, from big-budget blockbusters to bottom-shelf budget titles that can only be found in the back room of Hong Kong import shops. Unless you're Spanish, chances are you haven't heard about a little-known game named Torrente. Heralded on the box as ~the world's most offensive ex-cop,~ Torrente was just one we couldn't wait to pop open and see for ourselves. A game starring a balding, fat, sexist, foul-mouthed, gun-toting Spaniard? Sign us up!   Apparently the main character Torrente is somewhat of a pop hero in Spain, and there have been a few movies -- like the original Torrente: The Stupid Arm of the Law -- focusing on the exploits of this pig of an ex-pig, uh, policeman. He sounds kind of like Dennis Franz's portrayal of Detective Andy Sipowicz on NYPD Blue, only with less buttcrack shots.  The opening sequence of the game presents us with our hairy, husky hero sitting in a spa with two ladies ~servicing~ him. Torrente commands one of his little mermaids to stay under for a little longer, shoving her head under the water. Very classy, no? Unfortunately, the game's not all hot tubs and BJs... it's more like tepid soup and BMs.  Torrente kind of reminds me of State of Emergency, only not nearly as fun. It's a shooter, so it's pretty much constant action. Many of the nearly 60 missions are timed as well, meaning you have to keep on your toes to get through each level. For a budget title, the world is fairly active, with lots of cars, pedestrians and baddies filling the streets of digital Madrid.   You can play in either a first-person or third-person view, but in each you slowly waddle through town with no real indication of where to go until you get close to a target area. Given the clunky, imprecise controls, it's almost impossible to get a good bead on enemies in the third-person view. The aiming difficulties aren't nearly as pronounced in the first-person view, but the mouse cursor still doesn't track as smoothly and accurately as most first-person shooters. There are also a few rail-shooter areas where you ride along a pre-determined path (there is no actual driving in the game) and shoot at bad guys (and girls). These sequences are the most entertaining part of the game, and while they break up the monotonous, slow-paced gameplay a bit, they still don't get the adrenaline pumping.   I asked for a Mr. Pibb, sister!  One of the most frustrating aspects of Torrente is how easy it is to die, at least in certain circumstances. While it's usually a cakewalk to take out enemies from a distance since they just run right at you, those armed with rocket launchers and grenades often take you out with one shot that you may not even see coming since they're often obscured from your view at the top of a hill or high atop a balcony. Much of getting through particular areas in the game requires a lot more luck than it does cleverness. Couple this with ~instant death~ autos which sometimes do and other times don't stop for you when you cross the street and the fact that you can't save your game in the middle of a mission and you have an exercise in aggravation that certainly isn't worth a title of this low caliber.   In addition to the clunky gameplay mechanics and design, Torrente also features outdated graphics, with blotchy, low-res textures, jerky animation and blocky character and object models. The limited sound effects, poor voice work and repetitive music only served to remind me that I was indeed playing a ~budget~ title. As you can guess by now, we certainly can't recommend that you rush out and buy a copy of Torrente. It's a slow-paced shooter with shoddy AI, dated graphics and a frustrating design. Even though it's good for a few irreverent laughs, it's not worth paying for, even if you find it hanging out in the bargain bin... or a hot tub.", "date": "Feb 4, 2005"}
