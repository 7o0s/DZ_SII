The desire for lightning to strike twice is almost palpable in Glu's Marc Ecko's Getting Up, which is directly tied into the upcoming Atari graffiti game of a more extended name. And for the most part, they succeed. Marc Ecko's Getting Up is a fast, breezy platform game with some graffiti elements sprinkled throughout that will likely be enjoyed by its target audience.   Marc Ecko's Getting Up stars Trane, an artist fighting back against the oppression regime of New Radius City by the only means available to him: graffiti. To encourage freedom of expression in this culturally locked down dystopia, Trane must scale the city, painting tags on highly visible surfaces that will inspire the masses.   Of course, Trane doesn't start as prime public inspirado. At first, he's just considered a ~toy,~ and must prove himself by painting relatively small tag before moving on to bigger bombs that require multiple ~passes~ to paint. However, as Trane gets better, he can replay levels and run new paths through them, bringing more vibrancy to the city. These additional runs also add considerably replay value to the game -- with nine levels and three difficulty levels that unlock new routes, it's not stretching too much to say Marc Ecko's Getting Up have twenty-seven levels.   Trane can't paint word one without the required tools: spray cans. Some cans are picked up by simply running over them, but in later levels, cans must be collected in sequence, in a specific time limit, and a combination of both.   New Radical City isn't about to let Trane tag without resistance. Trane really gets under the mayor's collar, and eventually, he starts setting up obstacles and drones to intercept him. After getting a few levels under his belt, the game introduces obstacles like robots that are on the lookout for young punks like Trane.   As mentioned, Marc Ecko's Getting Up is a fast game. Things move at a good clip, but keeping up with Trane's acrobatics is quite easy thanks to easy, responsive controls. Gliding Trane around the level -- and he does glide -- with the thumb pad is simple, with up making Trane jump. With a good head of steam built up, a full-bore Trane can make some impressive leaps across the levels.   Marc Ecko's Getting Up features some interestingly layered graphics. At first glance, the game really looks drab -- but that's the point. Trane's tags introduce color to the world, and soon levels go from black and brown, to something right out of a Lucky Char's box. The music, provided by DJ RJD2, is excellent -- very appropriate for the game. The tracks may be short and loop quite often, but they drip with atmosphere.  Marc Ecko's Getting Up is a fun, fast action game that should convince more than a few traditional video game players to test out the mobile game space. With easy control, more ~grown up~ objectives, and good production values, Marc Ecko's Getting Up is bound to find an audience, regardless of whether the console game is a hit or not.", "date": "Sep 8, 2005"}
