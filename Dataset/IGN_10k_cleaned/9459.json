In this second season premiere episode, the demented dog and rabbity detectives bring the same mix of frantic storytelling, hilarious gags, demented characters and generally tolerable puzzles. In all it's a great start to a new season that takes the best part of the previous season and builds on them in intriguing ways.  The game picks up shortly after the conclusion of last season so if you've played the previous adventures, you'll enjoy all the great references. The office is packed with new souvenirs from previous episodes and there are plenty of jokes about Max's somewhat unusual term in the Oval Office. It's nice to see this kind of continuity in the series, but that doesn't mean that new players will be lost. Once things get rolling, long time fans and new players are treated to loads of brand new content, some of which only hints at its greater use in forthcoming episodes.   Disney lawsuit averted! We don't to spoil the story too much, but it begins with Sam and Max coming under giant robot attack and following the clues north to a paranoid Santa who has barricaded himself in his workshop and started threatening his elves with a machine gun. From here players will have to find a way to confront the source of Santa's unease. Along the way, they'll explore the newly opened Stinky's Diner and try to set things right in Christmases past, present and future.  The first thing that fans will confront however, is the pre-game screens where the COPS hilariously walk the player through a number of new options. You'll have the chance to select your graphics settings and choose an overall hint level for the game. The hints are nicely worked into the game with Max chiming in with helpful clues whenever the player starts to get a little aimless. It definitely helps players who aren't as used to the types of puzzles that Sam and Max face but in any case the puzzles here aren't terribly difficult and even without hint help you can probably work your way through this one in a few hours.  I'm happy to say that the puzzles area bit more involved this time around. Some are still limited to the ~use obvious item A on obvious item B~ variety, but there are even more multi-part solutions that require players to connect items or events that are a bit removed from each other. In the best cases, the solutions to one puzzle lead to the items you need to solve another, unrelated puzzles. Discovering that helping the waitress at the local diner gives you the tools you need to save Sam and Max in Christmas Future, or how the World's Simplest Maze can, through a circuitous route, save a rat's life and his marriage are just of the joys to be found here.  Pop-singing killer robots are always funny. There are also a couple of interesting mini games to play this time around. We still get the requisite driving level but this time the much more hilarious and distributing objective makes it a much more interesting diversion than it has been in some previous episodes. The other mini-game involves a boxing match against a trio of rats. While it offers a great change of pace for the game, the actual controls and challenge are relatively simplistic so players who have any coordination at all shouldn't have any problems getting through it.      We had been growing tired of the same old locations by the end of the first season, so it was nice to see so many new locations used here. Better still, the two old locations that are reused, the office and the inconvenience store, are substantially different this time around. We were a little sad that we didn't get more time with Bosco, but we're sure he's been set up for more interesting interactions in future episodes. The new locations include Stinky's Diner (finally!) and the North Pole. Both are filled with great gags, particularly the gifts and dentally challenged elves in Santa's Workshop. There's also the new PimpleCar shop, which isn't pronounced like it sounds and employs some of our favorite characters.  On the subject of returning characters, what in the world are the Soda Poppers doing in this episode? They've outlasted their comic value and, worse still, their inclusion in this story brings absolutely nothing to the plot. Sure, they tell you Santa has gone crazy, but you'd discover that anyway once you meet the elves. Their bit at the end is sort of funny but again, doesn't really require them.  Santa's a little naughty. To make up for this, though, Santa's elves are truly amazing in an eerie, unsettling way. They look less like elves than Charles Schulz's version of Nosferatu. Their teeth, ears and unhealthy complexion are perfect for the game's perverse take on Christmas. They also allow for some of the best humor in the game. At one point Sam and Max are trying to get an elf to cry so they tell him that they killed his dog. When he points out that he doesn't have a dog, they tell him that they bought one for him...and then killed it.  The opening of the Diner finally gives us a chance to see Stinky, who doesn't look like the name might suggest. Stinky's attitude is more caricature than comedy, but it's nice to have more folks living on the block than just Sybil and Bosco. Other great new characters include Santa, the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future, and, perhaps most hilarious, the pop-singing Maimtron 9000.  The graphics are just as good as ever with fantastic character, with loads of great acting and lighting to add to the realism of it all. Santa and his elves are clearly the standouts here, but the Christmas ghosts are also thoughtfully designed. I think the designers could have exaggerated the small future and past touches that they applied to the ghosts but the small details are effective.  How many Torture-Me-Elmers can you hit? Santa's Workshop is also brilliant with exactly the kind of freakish toys and gift-making contraptions you'd expect to find in Sam and Max's vision of Christmas. Stinky's and the PimpleCar locations are a little bland, as is Bosco's new store, but there's enough visual action in each of the other areas that you won't feel like you've been cheated.  As expected the music in Season Two is great, with a kind of jangled Christmas flavor that works perfectly for the North Pole setting. The voice acting is as good as always with some particularly good moments from both of our two heroes, the listening bug and Abe Lincoln's head.It's hard to judge these small episodes by the standards we normally reserve for most games, but anyway you slice it, this new episode is a great beginning to what we hope is going to be a great season. The puzzles are enjoyable but not overly taxing, but that's not what you play the game for. What you're really going to enjoy here are the great new settings and gags. The new stuff makes the whole experience seem fresh. Let's just hope they don't get overused in the coming months.", "date": "Nov 8, 2007"}
