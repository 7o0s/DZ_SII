Crawfish Designer:  I've got another idea kicking around we can do... Acclaim Executive:  From scratch?  Crawfish Designer:  Of course...in fact, I want to do it that way since the last version was simply a modified Maya the Bee... Acclaim Executive:  Will that take a long time?  Crawfish Designer:  We can probably do it in six to eight months.  Acclaim Executive:  EIGHT MONTHS??? But I want a new game NOW!!! Isn't there anything you can do?  Crawfish Designer:  Uh...well... Acclaim Executive:  Can't you take the first game and change a sprite here and there, and call it a day?  Crawfish Designer:  Uh...we could, but I'd rather... Acclaim Executive:  Great! I want to ship this thing while the gravy train's still running on those two adorable twins. Did you know they're not identical twins? Isn't that amazing?  Crawfish Designer:  If you say so.  Acclaim Executive:  And you forgot the monkeys last time! Kids love the monkeys.  Like the fictitious conversation in our review of The New Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley, the above conversation didn't actually happen. But it sure could have. Features Five adventures  Ten levels per adventure  Digitized voice  Password save  For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  Since Acclaim didn't bother to let Crawfish change any aspect of  The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley for its sequel,  we won't bother to change much of our review for Mary-Kate & Ashley Get a Clue. Believe me, the game hasn't changed one bit. Graphics, music, gameplay  all the same. The only thing that's changed is the level and puzzle layout. Thank god for the ol' Cut and Paste.  You have to hand it to Acclaim for trying to attract a near untouchable market: the young girl gamers. By snagging Mary-Kate & Ashley for a series of videogames, the company hopes to grab a nice piece of the pie that no one really bothered to go for, at least on the Game Boy. Problem is, all the company is really going for is the name on the box. It doesn't matter what goes into the cartridge  as long as the game features the twins, it's golden.   That's not to say that Get a Clue on the Game Boy is a bad game  it's not. The problem is, the game is very complex and frustrating to play, even for seasoned gamers like myself. So what we have is a game that will only appeal to girls, but the game itself isn't balanced for the market it's going for. No male in his right mind is going to ask his folks to pick him up a copy of this game, simply because of the subject matter. And as far as I can tell, only a few girls are actually going to be able to trod through this complex puzzle game. Way to reach out to your audience, Acclaim.   The game (you're nuts if you think I'm going to type out ~Mary Kate and Ashley Get a Clue~ every time) is very much like The Lost Vikings. Each puzzle challenges you to control Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their dog Clue independently, trying to obtain a puzzle piece to solve each of the game's five ~cases.~ Each case is separated in ten levels, each having one puzzle piece to grab. You must have the three work together to flip switches, eliminate hazardous enemies, and climb high ledges to get the piece of the puzzle. What's more, each character has its own strengths. Mary-Kate, for instance, has a bouncy head (just like in real life, I guess) which enables the other two to jump on her noggin and spring to higher platforms. Ashley can pull switches as well as pick up and throw the dog (huh???) to destroy enemies that would normally put the three out of commission. The dog is small enough to fit in little gaps, and he can carry the two on his head. The puzzle pieces are always hiding behind a closed gate, so you need to figure out how to get Ashley to an activation switch and another to the gate at the same time. You control each character independently, switching back and forth between them by hitting the select button. If any character ~dies~ during the level, you start over until you run out of lives.   You can also get hints to each puzzle by collecting three ~clue~ icons floating in each level. Problem here is, in many cases the clues are harder to get than the puzzle piece, and by the time you get the clues you will have already figured out how to solve the level. And some of the puzzles are just really hard to figure out. The only way you're going to solve some is doing the ol' trial-and-error deal. Sacrifice a few Mary-Kates and Ashleys to see how to get from one ledge to another. Another problem: limited lives. And you only get a password after you solve an entire case.   The only time you're going to realize this is a Mary-Kate & Ashley game is the little bits of digitized images thrown between the rounds. And you'll also hear recorded audio from one of the kids, but it's so garbled that you'll never know which one is talking. The audio is so low quality it sounds like they're talking underwater. And the character sprites  good luck trying to see ANY similarities to the twins. They might as well have been little green elves trying to collect the fruit of the Magical Yum Yum Tree.        It's not exactly ~shovelware~ in the sense of the word's definition, but it sure feels that way. Get a Clue was made very cheaply and very quickly in order to get a game on shelves as quickly as possible.  The game is exactly the same as the last version with slight changes in the sprite animations  which means, it's not all that bad. It's just disappointing to see that Acclaim is green-lighting the technique of duplicating existing games for ~new~ titles. We're watching you closely, Acclaim...", "date": "Jun 7, 2000"}
