There's even one for the sexier, but dumbed down CSI: Miami. It's taken years for someone to finally get a CSI game out on the Nintendo DS, in the form of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Dark Motives. Now children have the ability to poke at dead bodies while riding the bus! But instead of a real game, all the portable crowd gets is a toned down, uglier port of a three year old computer game. Someone needs to investigate that crime.   Welcome to the Las Vegas Crime Lab, circa 2004. Greg is still just the wacky lab guy, Catherine's ex-husband has not been brutally murdered, and Sara is still on the team (and not banging Grissom). Playing the game is like watching old reruns of the show on Spike. When it was first developed for the PC, Dark Motives was probably pretty accurate to the show, but now it feels dated. Why didn't Ubisoft decide to make a DS version of their newest CSI game? Or even their last one? It's a bummer when the DS doesn't get a unique game, but it's even worse when they just get an old hand me down title.   The game is comprised of five cases that you, the new rookie CSI, have to solve. You're teamed up with a cast member partner that follows you around from crime scene to lab and back again. They're there as a reminder that, yes, CSI is a game based on the hit CBS show of the same name. The cast member does do all the talking and expositing while you do all the work.   Work involves going over crime scenes with a fine toothed comb. CSI is all about the evidence, and it's up to you to find it. By dragging the stylus over every inch of area, you'll discover areas to look closer at. A large portion of the game is about using the various tools at your disposal. Dusting for fingerprints, swabbing samples, and getting shoe imprints is a regular occurrence in the game.   Analyzing vomit and bugs, all in a day's work at the Vegas crime lab. After collecting evidence, players need to analyze it, like matching fingerprints and hair fragments. Much of the work is done by Greg, who gives you the scoop on all the stuff you collect.   The gameplay does a pretty decent job of capturing the feel of the show when it comes to analyzing evidence and questioning suspects. The actual collection stuff gets repetitive and boring, though. Sure, it's cool the first few times, but each case requires poring over every location. We imagine real crime scene investigation work is probably equally as boring (and a fair bit more disgusting), but at least they are solving real murders. Sometimes the victim in Dark Motives doesn't even have the decency to die in the crime.   Since the game is a port of a PC game, things obviously had to be toned down a bit. However, it's a shame that all voice work had to go. The classic, first-person flashback cutscenes that are a staple of the show are far less entertaining when we have to read what Catherine or Nick are saying. Not to mention that since the text is displayed on the bottoms screen and the videos are on the top, it is actually physically impossible to see what's going on in both scenes.   Oh, and there's no The Who theme song. That blows.   CSI doesn't really lend itself well to a pick-up-and-play situation, either. After playing for a bit, then setting the game down for a while, we found it hard to just jump back in to the case. Players may find themselves having to re-read the suspect and evidence summaries just to remember what track they were on.   It's usually not a big deal since the game is not very long. It's clearly designed to appeal to the mass market, so the difficulty is low. It's basically a ~click on everything and talk to everyone~ game. The problem lies with the rigid programming that may drive players into dead ends. For instance, in the first case, players can get all the way to the very end, but cannot complete the case if they missed looking at a tire track at the very beginning that has no major significance. Taking a look at message boards for this game on various websites shows that a lot of people got stuck in that exact situation, actually (meaning we're not the only idiots to get stuck for a whole day). It's bad programming for a game to restrict a player for not doing innocuous goals.   Even when the game isn't being overly restrictive, it's frustratingly slow. We kept solving the crimes well before our partner did, and even had enough evidence to prove it. But Dark Motives forces the player to go through each little step and analyze everything, important or not, before it lets them make progress.If you're a pretty big CSI fan, you'll notice that this game is not based on the CSI you know, but rather the CSI you used to know. The game is a dated port that did not fare well in the move. Gone are the graphics and sound that made the game fun to play for fans of the show. Unfortunately the tedious gameplay remains, creating a dark, boring, and sometimes very silent experience. Wait until the DS gets a proper crime scene game, or maybe a Law and Order game.", "date": "Jan 31, 2008"}
