Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, the first budget-title on the Xbox 360, is actually an overpriced current-generation game. You can plug in your component cables and take advantage of the consoles high-definition capabilities, but you'll be disappointed to see a brushed-up version of the Playstation 2 title. It's a shame, too, because Dynasty Warriors fans have stuck with this franchise for so long, and going next-generation was Koei's opportunity to take DW to the next level. Unfortunately, the game is stagnant, right along with the rest of the franchise, due to monotonous gameplay and the lack of any significant improvement.    We're going to go straight to Chris Roper's uncompromising PS2 review of Dynasty Warriors because, well, this is the same game. As for the 360: you're not going to notice any great improvement in HD. We all love our achievements and our gamerscores, but porting current-gen games to the 360 is poor form. Fans of the franchise deserve better, despite the lower price tag. Here's what Chris had to say:   And yet another rendition of the Dynasty Warriors franchise graces our consoles with the release of Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires. Well, graces may not be the appropriate word, depending upon whether you're a fan of the series or not, though there are apparently plenty out there.   Just as the series has been doing for the past few ~main~ releases, Koei is in the midst of releasing updates and different variants of Dynasty Warriors 5. First came Extreme Legends, and now we have Empires. The game is essentially the sequel to and brings over the turn-based strategic elements of Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires. In the main Empire mode, you begin by assembling a crew of officers and picking a lot of land that your newly formed empire will begin on. Each turn, you have the option to perform a few maintenance moves and then invade a new territory should you feel inclined. The goal is to take over the whole land mass within 100 turns, or 25 years.   Chop, chop, chop, chop. Aside from the bits of strategy however, DW5 Empires features the same old Dynasty Warriors gameplay that really hasn't changed much at all since its inception years ago. That is to say, it's outstayed its welcome, and Koei really needs to change things up. Hopefully the series will see an overhaul as the series fully moves into the next-generation.   The gameplay still features hundreds of completely idiotic warriors on-screen and still heavily relies on mashing the Square button over and over and over again, with the occasional press of Triangle or Circle thrown in just to mix things up ever so slightly. Again, nothing much has changed here and the basic gameplay is really starting to feel outdated. Even with all of the strategic elements added on here, you still have to hit up the battlefield from time to time and the combat is really quite poor and entirely boring.   Enemy soldiers are dumb as bricks, to the point where standing still will only get you hit once every ten seconds or so if you aren't near an officer. The soldiers simply swarm around you and then wait to be killed. This isn't fun. At least the enemy officers fight back, but the one-on-one combat is quite poor because the blocking system is essentially broken. It's really touchy and half the time it seems like your character doesn't want to block whatsoever. On top of this, it's quite easy to be caught in the midst of a combo, which can be pretty frustrating.   The empire will be yours... for only 40 bucks. Outside of the actual combat, there's a semi-interesting strategy game here. Though there's a Free mode included where you can jump into a set of predefined battles and play as either the attacking or defending side, the Empire mode is really the focus of the game and easily its coolest part. It's only about 2.46% as deep as a PC strategy game, but it does have some redeeming qualities about it.   Each turn you're able to enhance your technology, hire new officers, buy new soldiers, form alliances and so forth. You have a limited amount of things you can do per turn, which keeps the game moving at a simpler pace since you really don't have to worry about 5,000 things at once, but what's there is decent.   It's not enough to save the poor gameplay, however. Mashing a button for hours on end while getting stuck in combos because of a poor blocking system is simply no fun.  Dynasty Warriors has long outstayed its welcome, and even with Empires' semi-cool strategic elements, the game won't please anyone except the die-hard fans that, for whatever reason, just keep coming back for more. 360 owners deserve more.", "date": "Apr 1, 2006"}
