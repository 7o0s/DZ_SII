Those skaters are athletes, executing amazing moves with grace and precision that most people could never dream to do. Recreating that kind of artistry on mobile is a great idea, but Abandon Mobile's NBC Sports Figure Skating is just a basic rhythm game that gets boring too soon for its own good.   The mechanics are simple: You simply tap number keys (1-6) as they slide across the bottom of the screen. The closer you get to the exact moment the number slides into the center of the screen, the more graceful the move is -- and the more points you accumulate. Botch one number and it turns red, causing your skater to tumble and you sit the rest of the move out.   Skaters can skate either a short or long program, or do both for a full event. In the short program, you simply string together a few pre-chosen moves and gather up some quick points. The long program, however, has a pretty cool feature that I think fans will appreciate -- you design your own program from a list of moves, like the lutz, triple-axel, etc. The harder moves are worth more points, but if you do them over and over again, they start to lose their value. The best strategy is to create an artful program that shows off several moves.   However, even with you choosing your own moves, the mechanics never change. You still tap number buttons. And since your eyes are always glued to that number string (especially on tougher moves), you never get to look up and watch your skater in motion. That's disappointing, to say the least. The game is about figure skating, but you aren't truly able to enjoy the art.   Figure Skating allows you to pick from several different countries at the get-go, which affects the uniform colors. The rink looks fairly bland, but you don't really get to see it. Between runs, an announcer pops on-screen for a little bland commentary, but that's still a good addition. (Olympic commentators have been dishing out some pretty bland commentary this year -- so it's accurate, too.) There is some music accompanying each program that sounds fine, but the sound effect of the skater moving on the ice sounds like a cat trying to get out of a plastic bag.  Figure Skating is a good idea, but the mechanics are dull and you aren't able to actually enjoy the figure skating while playing the game. You can watch a replay, but it's only afterwards and that's not necessarily as exciting as watching it happen while you're interacting with the game. If you've caught Olympic fever, this game might be tempting to check out, but it will only hold your interest for as long as what's left of the Olympics themselves.", "date": "Feb 17, 2006"}
