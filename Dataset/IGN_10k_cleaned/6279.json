Before playing Ce-Lo, I had no idea such a game even existed. (But then again, I'm not much of a hip-hop fan -- save for Public Enemy. Remember when rap was actually about something?) But an unfamiliarity with the dice game didn't mute my enjoyment of Ce-Lo, which recreates the quick game of chance with what seems like solid authenticity.   The basic breakdown of Ce-Lo is:   1. The in-game bank determines the ante, or wager.  2. Throw the three dice to determine the ~point,~ which is dictated when two dice come up with the same number.  3. Roll again. If you roll over the ~point,~ you win money from the bank. If you roll under the ~point,~ you lose your wager. Roll the same amount as nothing occurs.   There are special rolls:   1. A ~1, 2, 3~ flush is the equivalent of craps.  2. ~4, 5, 6~ is called Ce-Lo. Roll this to take the pot.  3. Roll three of a kind, ~trips,~ and you instantly win your wager.   Just offering the dice game itself would give the game the depth of a mud puddle, so developer MENT added some tournament-style play where you compete against fictional in-game champions for upgrades to your crib. The wagering system, in which you must match wagers to play in a round, also is interesting. You do not have to always match an ante and play; you can sit out a round. If the computer tries to trick into a dumb bet, there is no pressure to just let the round pass you by. Learning when to take the ante and when to pass is a major strategy in Ce-Lo, and this grants Ce-Lo some much-needed depth for single player sessions.   (Ce-Lo does have a pass-and-play multiplayer mode, but this of course begs the question: Why not just play with real dice?)   Ce-Lo certainly gets the atmosphere correct -- the rough sketch style and bling-adorned backdrops set the scene for the hip-hop game. The game is fronted by a crunchy theme song, which gives way to dice noises in the game.  Ce-Lo is not the deepest mobile game to fall from the tree, but there is certainly some entertainment here for fans of games of chance. I like me some Vegas action, so the whole wager system drew me in, trying to trick opponents with big bets while avoiding such pitfalls myself. But ultimately, the game does wear thin -- which is the danger of recreating a game that can easily be played with other people.", "date": "Nov 4, 2005"}
