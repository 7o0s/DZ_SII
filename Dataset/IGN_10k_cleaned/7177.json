After Sega's brilliant arcade coin-op Top Skater blew away gamers (and scored a bundle of quarters), the remaining void left skate rats abandoned and suicidal (OK, that's a small lie). Why the hell are there so many snowboarding games, and not one damn skateboarding title?!! We all thought as the noose slipped over our necks.  Thanks to Electronic Arts, we don't have kill ourselves (never thought we'd be saying that! heh), and Street Sk8er fills the urban landscape with a pulsating, evenly developed blend of racing and event-based competition. You skate to beat the clock and all the while you're pulling off the burliest moves known to humankind. Whoa dude. Like Phat and stuff.  The solid list of characters and extraordinary cadre of stunts are most excellent. Most excellent. Gamers can pull off more than 200 different stunts, using all of the various PlayStation buttons (L1&2 and R1&2 included) and have a respectable variety of areas to do them in. Ramps, stairs, rails, walls, fences, and tunnels are there for your grinding pleasure.  To give the game a little spark, EA offers two modes, both simple enough to understand in an arcade second. Street Tour starts you off with four selectable characters and presents three environments (including two to three bonus stages), to beat them in. As you hone your mad skills, bonus characters open up with better attractive statistics, as do new courses.  The key to success is mastering monster-point moves and keeping a fast pace. Falling from your board is a disgrace. The faster you make check points and the more moves you pull off, the more points you earn. Make the grade on one course and move into the more difficult ones. If you're really good, you'll beat the game with all four characters, opening up short cuts and bigger ramps.  The other mode is Free Skate, which is just what it sounds like. It's untimed. Use this mode to practice moves, pull off heinous madness, and crank out the goodness.  EA located the perfect blend of thrash-punk alternative bands to complement this wonderfully unruly urban sport. Bands include Less than Jake, Weston, Plastilina Mosh, H2O, Straight Faced, I Against I, and Gas Huffer.   Street Sk8er is not analog compatible, but it does make use of the dual shock feature.After many hours with Street Sk8er, I decided that even though it is the FIRST PSX skateboarding game, it's not heaven. Don't get me wrong, it's not hell, either, and if it landed anywhere in between, it'd be lining up at the Pearly Gates with a Green Card and a surfboard. OK...what am I saying? This is a solid little skater with lots of opportunities to pull off tricks galore, but it's not a long-term relationship dude. Like, OK? Street Sk8er is decent looking, but its doesn't push any limits, that's for sure. The resolution is low, and the graphics are plain and unspectacular. The characters are like origami caricatures of real people, complete with sharp elbows, jaggy clothes, and glitchy little seams along every bending point. The game's biggest strength is its long list of gravity-defying moves. It absolutely excels in this area. Unfortunately, the weakest part of the game is its depth. You'll breeze through it in a matter of hours even though it'll take you a day or two to master all of the moves. If you have a friend or two who absolutely love skateboarding you'll have a blast vying for top scores and trading characters, but as a single player game, it's a quickie. Yes, you can open new gates, and open up new characters, but a few more courses and wider variety of objects to skate on would have made this golden. Despite its rough look, the fact that I was skateboarding made me feel good. Really good. Like when I was at 14, carving bowls at Skatopia or The Endless Wave or at the Snake in Reseda. I can feel the raspberries on my hip now. Ahhhh...I guess the best part of this game is just that -- I really felt like I was skate boarding again. Good on ya EA for bringing the first PSX skateboarding game out. For those who love skating, go buy this. For those who like it, rent this first.", "date": "Feb 25, 1999"}
