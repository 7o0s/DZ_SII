It's a Charlie Sheen movie and a videogame franchise. You should know both well.   For close to 10 years, Sony's been churning out these cartoon people -- I'm talking about the game, now -- and putting them on the links to putt, slice and drive their way into the annals of videogame history. Now, the series is set to trade courses for courts and go Wimbledon on your PS2.   If you've played a Hot Shots game before -- or even if you've just heard of them -- you should be familiar with this franchise's trademark: accessibility. The games are designed to be so simple that anyone can play but also so deep that you can spend hours of your time perfecting your attack strategy.   Hot Shots Tennis keeps this tradition alive but falls short of living up to the Tiger Woods-like image of its brethren.   Awesome serving lame. The X button is your topspin shot, circle is your slice and triangle is your lob. Backhand and forehand shots are determined by how you've positioned your player in front of an incoming ball, and serving is all about timing your button strike of choice -- X is a flat serve, circle is a slice serve and triangle is an underhand serve.   You now know everything you need to rock at Hot Shots Tennis. Go forth and melt faces.   Sounds like a piece of cake, right? Well, it is and it isn't. As I took Jun -- an oh-so-cute brunette in a little white tennis ensemble -- through the ranks, I found myself besting the computer by simply using topspin shots directed toward vulnerable parts of the court. If headphone-rocking JJ went to the left, I'd hit it far right. If Ashley, an all-around player in a skintight dress, went close to the net on the right, I'd hit it into the left side of the backcourt.   These simple moves are easy to pull off because -- just like you'd expect -- your shots go wherever you're pointing the left analog stick when the racket and ball collide. That means you have nine locations to slam the yellow fuzz ball.   Go, Jun! Go! Not every shot is going to be on the money. To make use of your precision punch, you have to hit the ball at the perfect time -- that split second when it's just hanging in midair. Hit it too early, and a little bunny appears over your player as the ball crosses the court and heads out of bounds. Hit it late, and a turtle appears over your player and the ball slowly makes its way over the net or into it.   It's this timing system and the science of alternating your shots that will make or break you as the game progresses. Just like all the other Hot Shots games you've played, the single player mode -- called Challenge Mode -- starts you out in the beginner class and has you work your way up the ladder knocking off set numbers of opponents to the next of seven ranks. This meant that I could just tap X during my domination of the lowest rung, but when I turned semi-pro, I needed to be lobbing when Momoko moved to the net and hitting slow shots so Jun could get a breather when the computer was on a roll.   So, the gameplay is fun -- but don't forget that just like Anna Kournikova, Hot Shots has parts that aren't perfect.     Remember Hot Shots Golf on the PSP? Sure you do. It was one of the only decent games for months on the PSP, but you didn't care because the gameplay rocked, there were multiple modes and there was a ton of unlockables -- hairstyles, shirts and umbrellas.   Tennis brought the gameplay but forgot the rest.   Sure, there are costumes, 14 characters, 11 locations and five umpires to unlock, but there's no way to pimp a player out to your liking -- you can put Jun in the schoolgirl outfit or Ashley in the American flag dress, but you can't mix-and-match. No crazy sunglasses. No sandals. No hats.    Let's get beyond the aesthetics. Remember how you could unlock new clubs and balls that would affect your character's stats in Hot Shots Golf? Tennis left that out as well. Here, stats are limited to the game telling you if your choice for the game is a baseline, net or all-around player and then rating a player's serve, stroke, volley and more. The catch -- you can't influence those stats.    I wish musical notes came out when I got excited. Fall in love with Jun like I did? Great, but even if you get yourself to the top tier of classes, don't expect to be able to get her stroke out of the gutter.   As far as modes, there are three: challenge, training and Fun Time Tennis. Challenge is just you playing matches to unlock stuff, training should be self-explanatory, and Fun Time is just you choosing to play with or against friends or the computer. Where are the mini-games?   Luckily, even with the multitap hooked up and four folks flailing their rackets, the game runs fine and looks good. In fact, Hot Shots Tennis looks good all the time. Courts range from the sun-splashed sand at Aloha Beach to the citified blue court at Sakuragaoka Park, but each of the 11 possible playing fields are bright, lively and feature clapping crowds.   Um ... some clever tennis reference should go here ... damn. And, yes, the characters look good, too -- they look disturbingly good. Each has individual animations and vocal work, but the girls all have really short skirts. I'm not a sexual deviant, but the replay's penchant to drop low and rise with critical shots left me feeling like I just had a guest spot on Dateline's To Catch a Predator.   I think I need a shower.I really like Hot Shots Tennis. It's a game that I'm going to keep playing even though I'm done with the review, but I'm short of being impressed. Granted, it's only $30, but when we get down to it, the title is asking its simple gameplay to be the sole reason you keep playing. You can't customize your character's appearance or stats, so it's going to come down to you beating the bejesus out of everyone in an attempt to unlock some umpires you're never going to use. Then, the game'll be over.", "date": "Jul 19, 2007"}
