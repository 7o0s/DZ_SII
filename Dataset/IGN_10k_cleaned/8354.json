Come to think of it, when was the last time we had a German team play? Or Lithuanian? Basketball's got the Final Four-you know pro-basketball doesn't count. Anyway, long story short, Sports Car racing has the GT Series. It is one of the most exciting levels of racing. You start out with some cash and entry into the qualifying stages. From these humble beginnings you work your way up the three levels of GT racing to take the whole championship.  The one thing that sets this game apart is the emphasis on car tuning. No, not cartooning, car tuning. There are any number of factors that go into these decisions, but you'll want to make sure that your car is designed to be driven by you. Every quirk in your driving style can be corrected here. There are no less than 14 separate options for you to mess with. That's a few too many for me, so I'll summarize how this whole process works. The car needs to steer, brake and accelerate. You can tweak the individual car components to get better performance out of each of these areas. In the higher levels of the GT series, you'll need to pay attention to this.  The biggest goal is maximizing the handling of your car. Either you're steering too much or not enough. I'm here to tell you there's all kinds of things you can do about it. You can change the tire pressure and compound. You can adjust the spoiler and airdam, raise or lower the ride height. The list goes on. You can even set your own gear ratios. Sort of a Yoshi-Donkey Kong trade-off (acceleration vs. speed to the ignorami). I messed with all kinds of these controls and it made a huge difference in the race itself. You can even change some of these things during the race while in the pits.   When you pull into the pit, it's not usually to change the angle of the rear wing. It's usually to have the crew bang the dented fender away from the tire. A pit menu comes up as soon as you drive into the pits. You can opt to change tires, repair damage, even allow the computer to finish the race for you. Mostly the pit is for fixing damage. You'll be amazed what a difference the boys in pit row can make in 25 seconds. I usually beat my car up real bad. Under intense pressure, I have been known to begin racing the wrong way. You can only take so many head-on collisions before you head for the pits.   The 14 GT cars include some pretty unique models. Besides the obligatory F1s and BMWs you'll get a chance to race the Vector M-12 and the Panoz Esperante. Mmm, flagrante delicto! EA says that they'll be posting more downloadable cars on their website soon. The ones that come with the game are plenty good though, and all handle fairly well. While the racing model is a little too harsh (especially for beginners) when it comes to spinning out or driving on non-paved surfaces, it's still a lot of fun. You have controls for your steering, your gearbox, accelerator and brake. Once again, here's a game with a great, customizable gear box but no drag mode. What a shame.  The cars respond realistically but it doesn't take much to send them into a spin. Just tap a racer on the rear bumper and you'll both be flipping around. I guess that's where all the tuning comes in. I still don't think the game is easy enough at the lower levels but with a little attention to the modifications that are possible, you'll do fine. You'll just need to run a lot of practice laps to find the set-up for you.  The tracks themselves are fairly short but they offer a lot of possibilities for racing. There are long straight-aways and short kinks, broad turns and wide lanes. The tracks are real racetracks though and they don't have a lot of identity. They're all rather plain and covered in asphalt. That's a good thing since, as with a real race car, your tires don't seem to actually grip anything but dry road.  Initially there are only four available tracks. Once you start heading into the GT series proper, you'll get access to over a dozen total tracks.  This is not a competition based on high speed and early leads. Sports Car GT's races are about endurance. You set varying race lengths, from 10 to 20 minutes up to two and a half hours. In a two and a half-hour race, the two and half degree adjustment you made to the negative camber will spell the difference between glorious victory and shameful defeat. Maybe if I watch Days of Thunder again I'll get better at it. Yeah right. If the secret to eternal bliss were at the end of that movie I still wouldn't watch it.  To practice the tracks and tune your car, you'll use the quick race mode. You can choose your vehicle, track, racing conditions and opponent number and difficulty. You're only able to practice with cars you've obtained in career mode and only be able to race on tracks that you've already been on. This kind of kills the game unless you start kicking ass on day one. You only get the primo cars and tracks after advancing pretty far into the series.  Graphically, this is good game. As I said before, the tracks look too much alike, but to be fair, these courses look a lot alike in real life. The computer cars are rendered beautifully but the player car graphics seem a little unstable. The colors tend to flash and shift from time to time. Damage textures are non-existent but smoke effects and skid marks are nice additions. The inclusion of nighttime and wet versions of all the tracks adds to the depth of the game. The dark and wet tracks are challenges for the truly skilled racer. That ain't me. Not in this game at least.  So there's quite a bit to this game but it's still one-dimensional. You get the advantage of a working cash model that allows for all sorts of modifications and options. It also gives you more motivation to get into the game. The customization features are great. Every car system is integrated into the whole racing dynamic. If you've got the attention and patience to work with this feature, you'll love this game.  On the downside, the series play, while exciting, is sort of flat. The tracks aren't that different and the initial batch of cars and tracks is very limited. The racing model emphasizes a more realistic approach in terms of handling and acceleration, and for me it's too realistic. Overall, I think I'd save my racing dollars for EA's Need For Speed High Stakes which should be out in a month or so.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jun 4, 1999"}
