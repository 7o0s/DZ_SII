Take Acclaim, for example -- the last two releases from the company (Mary-Kate and Ashley: Get a Clue and this one, All-Star Baseball 2001) have been little more than rehashes of the existing originals released months before.  In the case of All-Star Baseball 2001, the game is literally identical in pace and graphics to All-Star Baseball 2000. The only thing that's really changed is its difficulty in hitting -- it's now much easier to belt the ball in the Homerun Derby. There have been slight modifications to the field and stands textures, but that's pretty much it in a nutshell.  I actually played the two games side-by-side on two separate systems -- it's like playing it in stereo. Oh, and the statistics have been updated for this year's rosters <p if acclaim cant make a new game were not going to write review. so without further ado heres the All-Star Baseball 2000 review, updated for 2001. Features: Season and Playoff Modes Full MLB and MLBPA Licenses Homerun Derby Password Save Only for Game Boy Color   With All-Star Baseball 2001, KnowWonder (the company that acquired Realtime Associates, last year's developer) decided to take the tried-and-true engine of Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball of 1995 and make it the latest baseball sim for the Game Boy Color. I didn't know how well a five-year-old engine would hold up, but it surprisingly played well and easy, making it more accessible to the casual or skeptical baseball fan. The pitching is simplistic by having the gamer choose where he wants the ball to go, what kind of pitch to throw, and how fast is should be thrown. Also, there's an option to have automatic or manual fielding, allowing you to either decide to catch hit balls yourself or let the computer field the players automatically.  Graphically in many places, it lacks in comparison to Nintendo's own Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, with tinier, less detailed sprites and fewer colors. But the scrolling speed is much improved over Nintendo's offering. The stadium and field have been adjusted slightly to show more depth in the grassy texture. I don't want to be a nit pick, but for some reason, KnowWonder got the idea that every Major League Baseball player is black; I know for a fact that Greg Maddux is white. Character animations aren't the best at times, reminding you that you are playing with a five-year-old engine. There appears to be no transition between running to the foul line and the dive for the ball.  Despite those flaws, the game plays well. You're given many modes of play ranging from an exhibition to a full season to the coveted Home Run Derby. If you find your swing is sub-par, work on it with some batting practice or if you feel the yearning for a high-scoring challenge, play an All-Star game. All-Star Baseball 2000's interface in the game is very informative displaying the pitcher's ERA, the score, inning, and batting stats for the batter. It really tries hard to be an informative baseball game and I think accomplishes it quite well.  Compared to last year, All-Star Baseball has much better hitting control -- but it's a little too forgiving. Still, it's a leap above last year's. Improving the sound would've helped this one a bit, with more variety in stadium music and sounds that occur during the game like the crack of a bat.  The game honestly hasn't changed enough to justify a new brand. No link cable support, no changes to the gameplay, no new options. It's still one of the better baseball games on the Game Boy Color, but in all honesty that's not saying much. If you must have All-Star Baseball, look through the bargain bins -- you can probably find All-Star Baseball 2000 for ten bucks cheaper.", "date": "Jun 7, 2000"}
