Ten dollars for a port of a game that is more than a decade old is asking a bit much in our opinion, but there's no denying the arcade fun and depth that Sensible World of Soccer delivered in its heyday. It's no big surprise to learn it'll still put a smile on your face today.   At first glance, Sensible World of Soccer looks like a run of the mill arcade title. A single button is used for passing, kicking, heading and tackling. Looks can be deceiving though. There's depth here if you look for it even if there isn't any flash. An aftertouch spin can be put on the ball after you kick it, enabling you to bend the ball in ways that would make Beckham himself weep. There are season and career modes to play and coach your way through, smaller competitions, custom team options and a wonderful tactic editor in which you can lay out your own plans of attack.    The graphics are dated even after the facelift the game received for the Live Arcade, but Sensible World of Soccer is a classic game that packed in enough features to still feel relevant today. There aren't any real players or stadiums per se, but let's be honest with ourselves. If you live in America you probably wouldn't recognize those licensed features anyway.   In-game advertising on the XBLA. Value is certainly the central issue with this title and your perception of it is going to be different depending upon how you approach the game. For Sensible World of Soccer fans and other soccer nuts, the value is there without question. Those with a more casual bent might see things differently. First released in 1996, this version of Sensible World of Soccer can hardly qualify as new yet it still sports the 800 Microsoft Point price tag that is usually reserved for new games. It also serves some ads into the game around the sidelines, which probably took the most development time in a port that only adds the staples of online play, updated graphics, and achievements. Argue all you want about gameplay differences or improvements over the years -- for an entry level soccer gamer the flashy graphics and licensed players of the FIFA series will do just fine.   If you're making a choice between one of the more modern soccer games and Sensible World, you should know that there are some pretty drastic differences between the two. Sensible World of Soccer doesn't attempt to simulate the sport in the slightest. There are tactics that you can edit which tell your players where to move when the ball is in a particular section of the field, there are a ton of clubs to choose from, and the coaching mode falls somewhat in line with more modern games. However, the gameplay is exactly what you'd expect out of the Live Arcade. It's fast paced, passing can be more luck than science, and the aftertouch system allows you to whip shots with ridiculous spin. Games last just a few minutes and goal scoring is much more prevalent than what you get in real life.   We had some major issues with getting connected to an online game, which is more likely a symptom of the current sad state of the Xbox Live servers and not the launch troubles the game experienced. We'll give the game the benefit of the doubt, because when we did connect the game didn't experience any more lag than anything else we try to play right now.  Theres a reason Sensible World of Soccer is considered a sports classic. Unlike most sports games that feel dated and tired years later, this one holds up quite well. Its simple and fast, removing two of the hurdles many people find with the sport of soccer. The game also features an admirable amount of depth for a game that can be played with just a d-pad and the A button. If you arent nostalgiac or hardcore about your soccer, you might be better served with something more recent. If you are, well then you dont need us to tell you what to do.", "date": "Jan 3, 2008"}
