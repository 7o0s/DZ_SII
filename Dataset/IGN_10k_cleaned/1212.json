{"name": "Dinosaur", "name_review": "Disney's Dinosaur", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/01/disneys-dinosaur-2", "text": "As if the movie weren't bad enough, here comes the game of the same name. ~Dinosaur,~ on the big screen, is one of the worst films I've seen, even worse than Disney's usual crop of crap. Usually, Disney tries to incorporate cute humor to win its audiences over. Two perfect examples of this are Aladdin and the Lion King. Here, there was literally bubkus.  Sure, the movie was meant to appeal to little kids, but come on.  Disney can do a lot better than that!  I'll give Dinosaur one thing, though.  The computer graphics were fantastic.   The terrible plot, which mimicked just about every other Disney movie from the past, is the same thing that's been done time and time again. It makes Don Bluth's mediocre Titan AE look like his own masterpiece, the Secret of Nimh. So why bother making a videogame based on Dinosaur?  Because there's still money to be made in that thar name.  How someone can turn a movie like that into a game, I don't know.  But it's been done, and it's not fun.  Gameplay You start off treated to some pretty video from the movie.  A pteranadon carries an egg holding the game's main character, Aladar. After the bird-like dinosaur drops the egg, the game starts. Flia, the first character you control, says ~I'll have a look,~ and then flies around the first stage's island until she spots the abandoned egg.  Apparently, it is under attack by an oviraptor, which is one of the enemies you face throughout the game.   Flia explains that she has to save the egg, and then you take control.  Once the oviraptor is defeated (with one single strike), you carry the egg over to a nearby patch of moss, where it hatches.  Out pops baby Aladar, who is extremely hungry.  Zini, the second character, hears the baby dinosaur's cry and comes to its aid.  After the lemur collects and feeds two pieces of fruit to Aladar, he becomes a playable character (my, iguanadons grow fast).  You may then switch characters at any time.   Objectives in the game are very odd and make little sense.  In the first stage, once Aladar is fully grown; he and the other two characters team up to rid the island of carnivorous dinos.  OK, so you've got to beat all the enemies.  No problem, right?  Doing this is a little more difficult than you might imagine, especially for so early in the game.  It's frustrating that your characters get killed with just a few hits.  If you use Zini or Aladar to attack, you're likely to go down fast.    Zini and Aladar both attack on the ground.  Zini can either jump and kick the enemies or he can throw stones.  Aladar, on the other hand, uses his tail.  Since both of these characters are earthbound, it's much easier for baddies to him them.  An oviraptor, for example, will kill Aladar after two hits in the beginning of the adventure.  Flia and Zini, on the other hand, will be killed after only one hit.  If any of your characters die, and you have no life crystals in your possession, you will restart from the last save point you touched.   Flia, although the weakest character in the game, is the best to use for fighting.  Since she flies overhead, she's difficult to hit.  To clear out the enemies in the first stage, she's the one to use.  The others will be defeated swiftly by oviraptor packs.  With Flia, though, it's much more possible to kill your foes -- it just takes lots of patience.  After all, the oviraptors have 100 hit points.  Each time Flia hits one, she only takes off two.  That's 50 times you have to hit one oviraptor just to send it packing.  Those guys might as well be boss enemies!   Each character has his or her own special abilities.  Aladar, for example, can smash rocks and small trees with his tail.  When he does this, he creates stones and sticks for the two other characters to use.  Zini can store the stones and use them to throw at enemies from afar.  He can even jump on Aladar's back and throw them while he rides  (aiming, though, can be a chore).  Flia can hold a stick in her beak.  If she does this, she takes less damage from enemies and stuns them when she attacks.   Likewise, each character has his or her limitations.  Both Zini and Aladar walk on the earth, so they have to trek the levels on foot.  Flia soars in the sky, so she doesn't have to worry about obstacles in her path.  She can scan the level for enemies and items so you'll know where to go.  The only way she can be on the ground is if she lands.  In that case, she cannot move whatsoever until she takes flight again.  Aladar can walk just about anywhere, including some rocky hills, water, and other steep areas.  Zini is limited to flat territory and cannot go through water.  However, he can go anywhere Aladar goes if he rides on top of him.   Dinosaur loosely follows the plot of the movie.  After the first stage, fiery rocks rain from the heavens and destroy the land that Aladar and friends once knew as home.  Somehow, they survive and end up in other territory.  Later, Aladar finds a herd of migrating dinosaurs which is searching for lush, green land and water.  In one stage, you have to rescue three dinosaurs who have been left behind while avoiding oviraptors.  This slightly matches what happened in the film.   In total, there are eleven stages, most of which can be passed after only a few minutes.  At the end of each stage, each character gains bonus ~experience.~ When a character receives enough experience, his or her attributes raise a little.  If Aladar, Zini, or Flia are low on health, their hit points may be slightly replenished with fruit or special plants.  Fruit, as well as other items, may be stored in your inventory and saved for later.  Other objects you may collect are life crystals and lightning bolts.  Life crystals are ~one-ups~ and lightning bolts are used to unleash a special attack.   Once you pass a stage, you're treated to some pointless full-motion video. Sure, it's taken directly from the movie, but it makes no sense when mixed with the game. One second you're collecting fruit to feed a recently-hatched iguanadon, the next you're watching a massive explosion that rocks the sky.  After that, you find that Flia is hurt.  Once you save her, you get to see more video, which, although it looks good, is just plain confusing.  The poor gameplay is just a lame excuse to show off some stuff from Dinosaur, and the two don't mix well.  Graphics Blah.  They're just as bland as the gameplay itself.  ~Uninspired polygons with ugly textures~ describes everything down to a tee.  With some incredible-looking PlayStation games available and even more on the horizon, it makes me shiver to think that Sandbox Studios tries to get away with an appearance this lacking.  Dinosaur, the game, does the movie a terrible injustice.  Sure, the movie sucked, but it looked gorgeous.  The visual effects were eye-popping.  It was CG at its best!  In comparison, the game is a slap in the face of reality: Most developers just don't put effort into movie-based videogames.   What else is there to say?  The animation is poorly done and unrealistic.  There are practically no special effects to grab your attention outside of the pre-rendered cutscenes.  The overhead view limits what you can see -- that's a bonus, at least.  The video looks good, although its quality is low.   Everything else is disappointing, stage designs included.  Stages fit in a square map, which appears in the lower left corner of the screen.  Each level is small and each level is dull.  Sound The music bounces up and down.  What I mean by this is that in some stages, it's typical and boring.  In others, it's actually not too bad.  Some areas have a more ~orchestrated~ touch, while others lack creativity and feel.  The music is at its best during the cutscenes, although it feels out of place because the score during the actual game is mundane in contrast.   The sound effects and voice acting are good, for the most part, except for Flia. You see, Flia was a character that never appeared in the movie.  She was put in the PlayStation game to add a little variety.  Since she was never in the flick, her voice actress doesn't have the same ~professional~ flair as Zini and Aladar.  When she speaks, you can easily pick her apart from the others.  No, not because her voice is female, but because she sounds like an amateur narrator for a public access TV-show.   Zini, Aladar, and the other voice actors sound good.  They get annoying now and then, but that's clearly not the actors' faults.  For example, when you switch characters, the one you pick says something.  If Zini's the guy you choose, he'll snicker or exclaim something like ~Oh yeah!~ or ~Woohoo!~ Aladar will say ~Here we go!~ or ~roar.~  Flia will screech or say, ~I'll have a look.~ It gets old very fast.  The rest of the sound effects are run-of-the-mill.  Enemies make noises when hit, water splashes when you walk in it -- basic stuff.  I hated the movie, and I don't think any better of the game.  This is just a sorry excuse to make some bucks off of something else that Disney owns.  The game isn't exciting, the levels are drab, and the graphics are outdated. Dinosaur's objectives can be accomplished quickly, and the levels speed by.  Before you know it, it's all over.  Will kids like this?  Sure.  It'll keep little tykes and toddlers entertained.
