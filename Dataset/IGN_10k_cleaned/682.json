This is the game that arguably started it all for the industry, so it makes a bit of sense for Hasbro to exercise its Atari license and produce a remake. And while it was the joke of the industry when the company announced the game's redesign for the PlayStation and PC, the company came through with an outstanding game with a unique feel. Unfortunately, all the creativity that went into the console titles didn't make it into the Game Boy Color. Features Four Pong levels Three difficulty levels Only for Game Boy Color  Anyone reading the other IGN sites in the last few months might've seen my rave review of Pong: The Next Level on the PlayStation. This game was a classic remake done right  tons of variety, awesome graphics, and very tight gameplay. So it's no secret that I was excited to sit down with my Game Boy Color to see what Majesco did with the portable rendition for Hasbro. Insert disappointed, annoyed look here.  Granted, the Game Boy Color version can't provide the same 3D engine that the PSX version had, but you can see that the 3D game could have easily been 2D-ized. And that's what happened...to an extent. The problem here is that the variety of the original remake (no, that's not an oxymoron) has been left out of the level.  Pong is a simple game with simple rules  simply hit a ball across the playing field to the opposing side. Put one past your opponent's paddle and you'll score a point. Get up to 11 points and you've won the game.  The original pong is, thankfully, included. The odd thing is, it's not hidden  it's actually the very first option to select. Unfortunately, only three of the boards from the console game were moved over to portable form:   In the ice level, you simply hit the ball back and forth over a floating glacier, between two waddling penguins. If the ball hits a penguin, the ball's trajectory gets knocked off a bit. On occasion, another ball will show up from the middle of the playfield. (On the PlayStation version, every time you hit the penguin, it would ~lay~ another ball...up to four. This feature obviously didn't make it into the Game Boy rendition).  The soccer level gives each player two paddles, and the idea is to get it into the net maneuvering the paddles in unison to knock the ball past the opponent's paddle.  The jungle level offers the same pong action as the classic and ice levels, but the difference is a couple rollers in the middle of the playfield. These rollers spin to cause the ball to move a little weird when it moves across them. It may sound tricky -- and it was on the PlayStation version -- but the effect is so minimal you might not even notice it.  Each level offers two types of power-ups  the catch power up that allows you to catch the ball when it hits your paddle, as well an item that will speed up the ball every time it hits your paddle. That's pretty much it.  Okay, so it's just Pong, right? That's why the game got a low score, right? Wrong. There are many problems with this rendition: It's only one player. The game doesn't support the link cable, so you're forced to play one-on-one against the computer AI. Which brings us to... The computer AI sucks. Once you learn the simple technique, you can easily score one past the computer paddle. It's all a matter of moving the paddle up or down when the ball hits it, and it will knock into a sharp angle that the computer will never be able to follow. And even though it says there's   easy, medium and hard difficulty levels, you'd never notice any change. There's no payoff. Beat the tournament level, and you get a simple ~You Win~ screen. No extra level, no extra options, no nothing. At least the developer could have hidden the classic level as a ~bonus~ for finishing the game.   Pong could have been great on the Game Boy Color. As I played through the PlayStation rendition, I could see nearly 90 percent of the game 2D-ized for the portable. What we got was a horribly lacking port that looks like it was thrown together in a month. There was no love for Pong when this game was made.", "date": "Feb 3, 2000"}
