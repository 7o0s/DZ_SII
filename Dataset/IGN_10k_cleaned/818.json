With its fast gameplay, and deep options to customize your mechanized fighting robot, Armored Core quickly became a classic. A year later ASCII released Project Phantasma, an add-on of sorts that gave players more parts to play with and more missions to use them in. More than a year has passed since Armored Core addicts have gotten another fix, so Agetec has released Master of Arena, what probably will be the final installment of the series on the original PlayStation.   Master of Arena features nearly 30 new parts, 10 new levels and arenas, and almost 20 missions in a game that spans two discs. When it comes down to your customization choices, this is the ultimate Armored Core game on PlayStation, but it's not without its problems.   Gameplay Master of Arena continues the Armored Core tradition by placing gamers into the shoes of a Raven Mercenary. If you played either of the earlier installments, everything should be familiar. The interface and presentation hasn't changed much. The rotating menu is back, and the same options such as Garage, Mail, Shop, and more.   What has changed are a few little additions and new options in the menu. The first is Ex Arena, a new Arena mode in which some of the battle areas are classified for specific mecha types (humanoid, multiple legs, etc.). Next up is probably the biggest addition to the series yet, the Ranker Mk mode. In here you're able to adjust the logic patterns of the AC units for use in the Arena. This option enables you to adjust everything from the frequency of your shots, to how often the mecha will take to the air. That option makes this a must-play for fans of the series as it adds even more depth to the customization process.   As for the gameplay itself, not much has changed. Players receive an email or two detailing a job, and then they must choose which one you take. From there players are launched into the mission where they must use the mecha to complete whatever task they've been assigned. When the job is complete, players receive credits that than can be used to buy new robot parts (you can also find some parts hidden in levels). Also, players can still load saved mechas from Armored Core and Project Phantasma, a very handy feature.   As with the last two games, there is a two-player option that still supports the often forgotten link cable. In this mode you can each select your mecha (or load a custom one), and duke it out in an arena. It's this mode that gives PlayStation gamers their very own Virtual On.   Not has changed much in the gameplay department. The first game was great and the following ones have done an excellent job of keeping that aspect stable. My problem with the gameplay is the control scheme. It's the same as it was back in 1997. It's not that it is hard to control, but rather there is no analog support (it does have vibration though). Analog support has been an option in PlayStation games since late 1996, yet we are still getting games that completely ignore it! What's up with that?!! Players still need to use the shoulder buttons to look up and down, where it would have been much easier if they could use the right analog stick to look around.   Graphics Visually, Master of Arena has simply stopped growing. The graphics haven't changed since the original, and in the fifth year of PlayStation, these clunky visuals are showing their age. The mecha models are still solid looking, with the same quality character design as always, but the environments aren't as lucky. Ugly, pixilated graphics and effects show that this graphics engine was made more than three years ago. The only ~good~ thing about the graphics is that the explosions still look great. After a kill the target explodes into a very bright ball of light. Thankfully, the gameplay is addictive enough to make up for the somewhat bland graphics.  Sound As with the graphics, the sound has remained the same.  The music is almost completely muted out due to all the chaotic action that is usually going on in the missions. When you actually hear the music, it isn't too bad. As for the sound effects, they are what you would expect from a game featuring giant robots with high-powered weapons. Overall, Armored Core: Master of Arena is a good game. Definitely a better ~sequel~ than Project Phantasma was. Even with the graphics showing their age, the gameplay and concept behind the game is still fun and addicting. It's games with cool ideas such as Armored Core (and Carnage Heart) that will be remembered as PlayStation hands the torch over to PS2.  If you are a fan of Armored Core (or mecha games in general), you will probably find something here to enjoy. Even if you have never played Armored Core before, this game has enough to get you into it. And to get you excited about the PlayStation 2 version, Armored Core 2.", "date": "Mar 28, 2000"}
