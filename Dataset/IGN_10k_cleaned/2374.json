With the exception of *shudder* Extreme Tennis, Gremlin Interactive's forgettable Actua Tennis, and a few titles in the early 90s from Accolade and Infogrames, we here in PC land haven't seen a tennis game in years. And unlike our console brethren, none of the tennis sims released for the PC have ever really shined. Now Microids steps up to the line to serve us their spin on the oft-overlooked fuzzy ball sport, but unfortunately they whiffed the top of the net on their first try. It's not a double fault, but it's nowhere near an ace either.  When you first load up Tennis Masters Series, you're presented with a no-frills menu with four choices: Tennis Masters Series (full tournament mode), Exhibition, Network, and Options. That's it. Tennis Masters Series is just tennis, plain and simple. There's no training, there's no player creation, there's no special mini-games. You'll play tennis and you'll like it, mister. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice to see some other options to add to the depth of the game.  Since there's no practice or training mode, the Exhibition mode is where you'll face off against a few opponents before you make your way to the tourney. Yes, you can go straight to the full series, but unless you're a glutton for punishment I suggest against it, as even the default (and lowest) tournament mode difficulty setting -- Amateur -- is incredibly hard until you play a bit. When I first jumped in I wasn't able to even return the ball on a consistent basis, and I lost a few times in straight sets. Because of my poor performance, I decided to go back to the Exhibition mode and get a little practice on the Rookie level. In contrast to the Amateur level, Rookie is just plain depressing. My opponent was like me in my earlier games...he couldn't return any of my shots. Sure, it was a boost for my gaming ego, but I kind of felt like I was playing against the benchwarmer of the Special Olympics tennis team. After a few games I just went back to the Amateur level and ate it until I finally got better at playing. It would have been nice to have a level in between Rookie and Amateur so you could practice your skills, rather than just accepting the fact that you're going to constantly lose until you master the controls.  Speaking of the controls, making the game more difficult than it should be is the fact that the control system is sluggish at best, and just plain unresponsive at its worst. Setting up a volley in tennis comes down to moving quickly and getting in the right position to hit the perfect shot. With the lethargic controls, it's hard to get yourself into the sweet spot, and you'll often miss shots that you should have hit if your player reacted as fast as you do with the gamepad. With that said, there are times when your position on the court doesn't really matter at all. You can actually just stand in the same place and hit the ~flat shot~ button every time your opponent returns your ball and 80% of the time, you'll hit it...but where's the fun in that?  As unresponsive as the controls are, the basic dynamics of tennis are all represented here. As mentioned earlier, you can hit a flat shot, but you can also put a little topspin or slice on your volley, or smack a lob high over your opponent's head if he's crowding the net. Although this is to be expected, this is a nice addition after playing way too many tennis games on the PC back in the day where you only had one basic shot.  Visually the game has its ups and its downs. The multiple source shadows and lighting effects add the visual depth of the game, and the small details like footprints on clay courts add to the realistic look of the game. In contrast, the animation in the game is extremely choppy, and not only because of high system requirements. For example, your player goes from a crouched position to a full upright stance in only one frame of animation, and although the box boasts ~Over 500 animations using the latest motion-capture technology,~ I find this claim hard to believe after playing the game, as character movement is hardly as smooth as you would expect from 500 finely-crafted moves.   Another downfall of the graphics are the player models, which are blocky and repetitive. Although you have 67 players to choose from, there's basically only one model with variations of hair, facial hair, and clothes -- and there are no female models. And even though the game carries the ATP license, don't expect to play as Michael Chang or Boris Becker. Instead, all 67 players appear to be fictional players...at least I couldn't find any of them in the ATP directory. With the exception of clothes and racket color variations, there are no player customization options at all, which means you're pretty much delegated to playing cookie cutter versions of the same player.   One thing that does mix the players up a bit are individual stats and play styles. Each player has a particular type of play, such as baseliner or net rusher, which actually plays well in the game. For instance, and net rusher will actually make his way to the net given the right chance. As nice as the play types were, the stats didn't really seem to matter much, as the lowly scrubs played just as well as the pros.   Another big gripe I have about Tennis Masters Series is that multiplay is limited to a LAN. Yes, you can squeeze four players around a single PC for doubles play if you wish, but we all know that never really works. It's fun playing with your friends in a doubles match, but how many people actually have access to a LAN setup?  All in all, Tennis Masters Series is a frustrating tennis sim that has its share of entertaining moments. With a little fine-tuning on the controls, a few more options, and Internet play, Tennis Masters Series could have been a top seed contender, but unfortunately we're going to have to return the ball to Microids' court and hope they can get the next shot over the net.  -- Kip Merriweather      Want to share your opinions with the world?
