{"name": "Area 51", "name_review": "Area 51 Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/01/02/area-51-6", "text": "One of the columnists in the office summed up Area 51's arcade success perfectly: ~It was kind of fun, responsive, and cheap to make.~ That's true, too, for the Saturn version. While obviously not in Virtua Cop 2's class, Area 51 makes an entertaining half-hours worth of light gun goodness.A51 belongs to the gun game variant known as the FMV shooter. Using digitized characters and backgrounds, Atari manages to get a realistic looking environment at the expense of video resolution. Grainy but serviceable is the order of the day.You and a friend can play as members of STAAR, an anti-alien group that needs to seal off Area 51, that infamous Air Force test grounds in Nevada where real life aliens are supposedly stored. If you haven't heard about it, then you been a hermit for the last 2 years.Basically, shoot anything that moves except the blue-suited STAAR units. They're useless, and shooting them takes off a life unit, like VC2's civilians. Aliens and zombies are conveniently marked in bright, neon colors (red, green, purple, orange) so you don't have to pick out enemies on dark backgrounds.The game is pretty configurable, down to choice of blood and guts. However, the gun calibration isn't as robust as Virtua Cop 2, and doesn't have enough goodies for sustained play.However, levels are well designed, providing an equal amount of suspense and action, and play well, in both one or two-player modes. However, like Virtua Cop 2, this game is over all too soon, possibly due to FMV limitations. This is a fun game, and a good complement to Sega's VC games.Appreciating Area 51 isn't too difficult. At a glance, it's an attractive title with quite a few promising gimmicks and some slick gameplay. Closer inspection reveals a game slightly twisted by a strange collection of misshapen quirks and bizarre shortcomings. What neither perspective will tell you outright, however, is that Area 51 is ultimately a very good title worthy of a shooter enthusiast's time and money. From its chaotic beginning to its clinically insane conclusion, Area 51 provides just enough classic FPS action and technical goodness to merit a great rating and honest recommendation.[Ed's note: Given the FPS competition on PC and IGN's policy to review games based on how they stand within their specific platform's borders, the Area 51 score has been slightly lowered. This does not imply that Area 51 PS2 is better than Area 51 PC. Rather, it simply means that Area 51 on PS2 is better for PS2 gamers and it also happens to be more of an achievement there. Does that make sense? I sure hope so.]", "date": "Jan 2, 1998"}
