Another complaint we get is that there aren't a whole lot of good games that are suitable for kids and adults. Well we've got a solution for you today with a game that not only has a lower price point, but also tame enough for kids and deep enough strategy-wise for adults that feel like mastering it. Strategy games come in all shapes and sizes and MoonBase Commander is a great example of that. What is basically a puzzle type board game has been given a pretty nifty turn at strategy that everyone should be able to enjoy quite a bit. Complex isn't the word of the day. MoonBase Commander is all about taking some good simple ideas and turning them into a game a little like chess, albeit not as structured.    The story in MoonBase is a simple one and relatively unimportant when it comes down to it. Not much mind was paid to the extras here, but considering the game itself, it doesn't seen to matter to me. Basically, Earth has run out of resources almost so completely that the planet has been forced to unite into one cause to build exploration and mining operations on other planets. However, the folks that end up participating see the potential for riches or power and split into four factions that all have different ideas.   The factions are basically just window dressing though, because each of them has the same technology, units, and weapons. Yes they look different. Yes they sound different. But they play exactly the same. Each of them have a little bit of humor however that adds that enough personality to make you smile without seeming to try too hard. Take the industrial faction in the game and one of their taglines from the manual: At DeWulf, we turn planets into energy so you can watch football. And then there's System 7, a group of polite artificial intelligent machines trying to eliminate humankind from the universe. They politely ask that we accept our fate and lie down and die for them. It's the only logical choice and would make things so much easier. So on second thought, I wish there had been a little more story to this, with the simple descriptions of these factions, MoonBase Commander probably could have had a pretty entertaining story to it with a little bit of character interaction if it had wanted to.   Moving on, the actual gameplay is where this sleeper really takes off. You begin each game with a hub. If this first hub ever gets destroyed, that's it for you, you're done. From this hub, you can deploy more units (the structures are called units in this game) like more hubs, shields, anti-air guns, offense units, units to gain energy, and scouting units. The reason I call these units structures are that once they're deployed, you can't ever move them. This is where the game gets tricky. Every building in the game connects, via a web of energy lines, back to your main hub, just as every other structure also has to connect to a hub. Consider the bunch of units connected to the main hub as a tree. So if you cut off the main hub, which will consider the trunk, everything else must die. If you destroy any of the other hubs, everything attached to it and higher is destroyed like cutting off a branch. The farther back you cut to the trunk, the more damage you'll do. The only thing is, the trees are usually pretty big so getting a good hack at one of the bigger branches, or the trunk itself is a bit difficult. There are ways, but you'll need to play to figure those out.   Anyway, you can only connect so many more buildings to a hub because the energy lines attaching units to a hub can't be crossed. If you do throw a unit out from a hub and it or its line come in contact with other buildings, other lines, or water, or uneven land, then the building explodes and you lose the energy it took to make the thing.   In order to deploy one of these units or a weapon, you'll pick what you want to deploy from the interface (divided into cost of 1, 3, or 7 energy units), and then pick the direction you want to deploy it and the power you want to deploy it at. Your hub will then fire the sucker out into the air, hopefully to land where you want it. If it lands in one of bad areas, it'll detonate and you'll lose that energy. In some games, you'll also have to worry about wind affecting your launches from the hub just like in a golf game.   This style of play makes you really think out your next move and where you want to go with your overall strategy. You can get rid of a building by recalling it, but that costs more energy and you'll lose time in getting the enemy off of your planet. Eventually you'll have a large network of hubs and defensive units strung out across the landscape.   In order to build these units and the weapons (which I'll get into in a minute) you'll need to find an energy source. At the start and through the entire game, you'll get at least 7 energy units per round. Once you're out of energy for the round, you're done and you'll need to wait for the next round, so having more energy when you start a round is a good thing. In order to gather energy, you'll need to find an energy pool and then lay an energy collector on top of it. As long as it's there when the round starts, you'll collect energy. The more of these you have, the more energy you'll get.   Each round is divided into turns. Any move you make, whether a weapon strike or a unit deployment is considered a turn, no matter how much energy was spent. So those that use all their points right away may find themselves more at the mercy of the enemy later in the round. Deciding when to use these points and how to go about the round is just one of the fine strategic plusses of the game. Do you deploy that energy collector first to make sure someone else doesn't take the spot first, or do you try to destroy that offensive unit that's bombarding one of your hubs?   The weapons themselves in the game may seem fairly simple at first, but using them in the right situations, in the right order can get a little tricky. You'll have everything at your disposal from bombs and cluster bombs, to EMPs, shock weapons that travel along the energy cords, and viruses that eventually affect every unit in the chain. Finding when to use these versus deploying a new unit is the trick to winning the game, especially since only two units can actually deploy the offensive weapons.    Weapons strikes can come from hubs and offensive units. Hubs can of course build more units off of it and continue the chain farther to capture more territory, but offensive units can fire weapons much farther than the hub can. Building one of these two inside range of enemy units is necessary to win. Balancing advancing into enemy laden lands while keeping them alive at the same time and pressing the attack can be interesting sport, especially when playing against other human opponents. Often attacks will have to come in successive turns from one another to do any damage. For example, you may need to EMP some ground near the enemy shield generator before you can lob some missiles or bombs inside, or you may need to throw in a sacrificial cluster bomb to causing air defense to fire off (these units take a turn to be able to fire again) so you can attack the desired building inside the defenses the next turn.   There's a lot to consider and think about when you're playing a game of MoonBase Commander. It's one of those games that you can just get into and start to play, but will take a while to master strategies and accuracy of launches.   The graphics aren't an eyesore by any means, but aren't really flashy either, and sound is also very crisp and decent while there isn't a whole lot of it, aside from some nicely insulting digs when you screw up.   Basically MoonBase Commander is one better puzzle types strategy game than I've seen in a while. It may not compete with some of the fancier titles out there as far as graphical detail and complexity goes, but it's a really fun game that you can easily install at work to burn some time when your boss isn't looking, or just whittle away an hour or two without noticing the time pass. You'll want to find some other humans to play against however. While the computer AI isn't absolutely terrible, I only lost one game at the very beginning when I didn't know what I was doing.So go out and grab this relatively unhyped little game, it's choice for those on a budget at only $20 and should keep you occupied for a while.", "date": "Aug 26, 2002"}
