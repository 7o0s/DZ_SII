A small genre that has never been heavily explored on Nintendo's portable godsend, fishing, is recently strengthened with the unique RPG Legend of the River King, and this. Zebco Fishing boasts plenty of features to reel in customers, including play only on the Game Boy Color, a built-in rumble feature, and all-around good fun.  Features: Eleven different lures and 2 separate fishing lakes Tournament and Blackjack Bass fishing Built-in rumble feature Real voice samples Only for Game Boy Color  The one subtle objective of this game is that you should try to reel in the 21-pound Lochness Bass.  Although the game itself doesn't emphasize this, the instruction booklet hints to that you should attempt to catch this mammoth fish.  If you do manage to catch him, you will be a legend of the Twin Lakes.  Unfortunately, no one knows where he dwells, so you're on your own.  You have two choices of lakes from where you may fish, either the Chestnut Lake or Drake Lake.  Each has its own geography, as well as good fishing spots.  In your boat, you move about until you've chosen a location, and then stop and cast your line.  Once your line is out in the water, you can either let it sink or reel it in to try and attract fish.  If you have a bite, you have to try and hook the fish.  Sometimes hooking a fish is difficult based on the lure you are using, but most times it's relatively easy.  Once the fish has been hooked, reel it in.  If your line is far away from the boat, reeling will create tension.  If the tension grows to a great amount, it's smart to let your line out a little, thus reducing the tension and preventing the fish from breaking the line and getting away.  Most fish are not a bother at all, but the bigger they are, the more they put up a fight.  The amount of fish, where you find them, and their attributes are all affected by the weather conditions, time of day, and depth of water.  During a sunny day, fish of all sizes roam the waters, but on a cloudy day they might appear to be a little scarce.  7:00 AM, while the fish are hungry, is a prime time to hit the lake, whereas later in the day may prove difficult to land a lunker.  When fishing, if you let your line sink down to the bottom of the lake, your chances of getting enormous fish increase.  The lower down, the better.  Lures also play a major role in what fish you catch and where.  The ~black rig~, for example, works well on sunny days and in muddy waters.  The ~orange bucktail~ is most effective on cloudy days in murky areas.  If you're looking to cast line in shallow areas, the ~silver rattler~ is the lure of choice.  They all have their own advantages, especially in specific weathers and locations.  The two modes of play from which you may choose are Tournament Fishing and Blackjack Bass.  In both, your objective is to catch fish, but each has its own conditions.  In Tournament Fishing, you begin on either Chestnut Lake or Drake Lake at 7 AM, and the tourney ends at 3PM or when your lures have run out.  Your goal is to catch the biggest bass you can find, and you'll need to find the hot spots on the map that have the largest fish around.  Only bass matter here, so any caught perch, crappie, and walleye will be discounted from the competition.  The other mode of play, Blackjack Bass, is a little more interesting.  So you're a pro at the tournament?  This will require a little more luck.  You start out at a random time of day on one of the two available lakes, and your ideal intent is to catch no more than 21 pounds of bass.  As before, crappie, perch, and walleye will not have an effect on the game, and your blackjack number will rise only when you catch a bass.  Once one is caught, you will be asked to either hit or hold.  Like a normal game of blackjack, you want to stay under 22.  Going over, of course, will result in a bust, and the game will end.  If you choose ~hit~, you choose to continue fishing in hopes of bringing your number closer to 21.  If you ~hold~, you end the game with whatever number you currently have.  The only way to automatically win is if you catch the 21-pound monster, the Lochness Bass.  Getting that instant Blackjack will be very hard to do.  Some of the extras of Zebco Fishing make it an attractive game.  The rumble feature and in-game speech, for example, are things that make it stand out from most other Game Boy games.  Thankfully, it comes with one AAA Battery so you can rumble away right from the very start.  The sound samples are a little scratchy, but considering this is only Game Boy Color, it's pretty clear and easy to understand.  Vatical Entertainment also did a good job with the graphics, which are nice and colorful. Zebco Fishing is easy to play, fun, and has several extras that most other portable games don't.  The rumble pak addition is a real rarity on the Game Boy Color, and complements the feeling well.  Although the price is a little bit more expensive because of that, it's worth it; I wouldn't play this any other way.  If you buy any fishing game, this is a good one to have.", "date": "Feb 9, 2000"}
