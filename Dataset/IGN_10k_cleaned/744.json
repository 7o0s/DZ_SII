{"name": "Namco Museum 3", "name_review": "Namco Museum Vol. 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/03/11/namco-museum-vol-3", "text": "Once again Namco treads the thin line between tried and true classics and completely obscure padding material in their quest to bring original arcade games into your living room with six more games to rekindle those fond memories of yesteryear. Some, like the spunky Ms. Pac Man, are great, but most don't stand up to the test of time.      Galaxian and DigDug are bonafide classics.  They were fixtures in every arcade, pizzeria, and bowling alley for years.  The simplicity and fun of these two games remains amazing, especially for you nostalgia buffs.  Remember when Galaxian hit the streets and elevated the Space Invaders theme to a ~new dimension?~  DigDug was one of the first games with a vicious, dark underbelly - dig tunnels in a cutesy land, meet cutesy monsters, then inflate them until they explode!       Ms. Pac Man probably has the longest playability factor on this collection.  The whole Pac Man craze drove me bananas when it was in full swing but Ms. Pac Man had a certain hip spunk that seemed to elevate her above the hype. (Pac Grrrl?)  This is also the only game with different levels and animation to work towards, giving an incentive to play it beyond the first evening.     Pole Position II was certainly no big splash when it was first introduced: same game - new tracks.  Race and sports games also seem to weather the worst and PPII is a prime example.  With basic play mechanics the same in all race games throughout time, it is hard to retread with any satisfaction (dodging a car or two at a time while staring at dull background visuals just doesn't cut it in this age of Rage Racer.)  Coupled with the fact that controlling your car is virtually impossible with hair-trigger steering buttons, PPII will have you redlining it to the next game choice.      This brings us to the padding portion of the show.  Phozon and The Tower of Druaga (do any of you remember even putting a quarter into either of these?) round out Vol. 3.  These two throw away titles do nothing for the overall package.  Phozon has that classic arcade feel but the simple puzzle match premise almost instantly falls flat.  I could go on and on about how bad Druaga is but that would only seem to give it some sort of undue merit.  If moving around very slowly in a maze and attacking giant jumping beans only to discover how lame your sword attack is sounds like retro fun, well... Only for the true video game completist.      The bottom line is that although this disc contains a few pieces of history, the nostalgia factor wears off quick.  The museum is a nice touch but does nothing to add play longevity (and the load time is horrendous).  Be prepared to put this collection back into the time capsule after a few days of play.", "date": "Mar 11, 1997"}
