As you can imagine, the last couple of years have been quite productive for me -- as there have been far more U.S. entries in the strategy role-playing genre than at any other point in history. And while none of these titles from the past few seasons have yet to overtake the game that kick-started the whole revival in the first place (Disgaea: Hour of Darkness), that doesn't mean that they're not going to stop trying.   Atlus Software's Stella Deus: The Gate of Eternity is the latest attempt at dethroning the PS2 tactics champ, and I might as well tell you from the start that it hasn't done it. Developed by the same team responsible for the incredibly difficult (and incredibly addicting) Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, Stella Deus isn't a bad game by any means... in fact, it's actually quite good. It's just missing that special something that puts it up over the top.   On paper, though, The Gate of Eternity sounds like it's the be-all/end-all of tactical role-playing games. The storyline, for instance, has been penned by the legendary Record of Lodoss War scribe Ryo Mizuno, while the character designs have been overseen by Shin Megami Tensei master Shigeki Soejima. Throw in the aforementioned Hoshigami development team and a soundtrack by the awesome Hitoshi Sakimoto (Final Fantasy Tactics, Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter), and you have all the ingredients necessary for a surefire blockbuster. But strangely, a blockbuster isn't what we got.   Instead, what Stella Deus really is is a great entry-level strategist for two kinds of players: brand new users that have never played a game like this before, and diehard fans who automatically fall in love with anything that even remotely resembles Ogre Battle.   As expected, the plot and characterization is well above average and follows the misadventures of a young officer in the Fortuna Army called Spero. Grounded and good-hearted, Spero has haphazardly found himself in the middle of a quest to save the world, but things may not be as they seem. You see, Spero has been told by his longtime Alchemist friend Viser that the only way to rescue the people of Solum is by killing mystical spirits and draining them of their energy. This energy can then be used for Viser's alchemic practices to cure the population of their worsening apathy and bring their Overlord Dignus into full power.   Conserving AP is the key to victory. One day while on a mission, however, Spero and his cohorts run across a beautiful shaman named Linea who reveals that killing spirits is only making everyone's indifference worse, and that the true way to combat the problem is by opening the mysterious Gate of Eternity. From that point on, there's enough inner-conflict and relationship trouble to fuel at least half of Final Fantasy VII.   Needless to say, the characters and plot are among the strongest of the current crop of tactical RPGs, and it could even be argued that it's the single best of the category. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you think about it, especially when considering that the somewhat generic theme (ie, the Miasma, an ominous worldwide mist, is sending the entire planet into the end times) has been used several instances before in games like Final Fantasy Chronicles and Legend of Legaia. Truth be told, I have to give kudos to Mizuno for finding a way to make familiar territory feel not-so-familiar after all.   The plot, along with the music, is what Stella Deus does best. On that same token, Sakimoto's soundtrack picks up right where Gradius V left off and continues to prove why the composer belongs in the same class with guys like Nobuo Uematsu and Yoshinori Mitsuda. Of particular note, are the themes that play when battling the blood-lusting General Viper and just about anything else that plays during cutscenes. The music here is truly excellent and joins the storyline as the standout elements of the game -- It's makes me want to hear what Final Fantasy XII (Sakimoto's next game) has to offer even more.     Despite these strong lead-ins, however, Stella Deus begins to falter when it comes to the most important aspect of tactical fantasy: the battle engine. To be fair, the mechanics of The Gate of Eternity really aren't bad at all -- they're just overly simple (most players should be able to master the controls and the concept before the end of their first battle). Like most games in the genre, Stella Deus utilizes an AP system that dictates how many squares each character can move, and whatever's left over determines what kind and how many attacks you can pull off. There's really nothing more to the battle system than that, except for the occasional use of team moves that do even more damage than your single attacks.   Where the strategy (and key to victory) comes in, is in the placement of troops and which characters you decide to use. Limited to only six combatants at a time, players will have to choose the right fighters for the right situations and make sure that they're setting themselves up for optimal strikes. And by optimal strikes, I'm referring to the trade-off between movements and attacking -- as taking fewer steps means more AP for multiple blows per round for both you and your opponent. Overextending yourself could potentially be deadly, so as I said earlier, understanding how you want to proceed with each challenge is the trick to mastering the game.   The only problem with this kind of simple combat is that Stella Deus is pretty easy to go through. Other than a couple of difficult bosses here and there, you shouldn't have too many problems making your way through the adventure. And when you throw in the fact that items, money, and experience levels aren't as hard to come by when compared to similar games (especially when you dive into the Catacombs for the optional level boosts), experienced players should have few problems making their way through. I did appreciate, however, the added level of depth that Pinegrow threw in for completists -- being able to upgrade your character class, fuse new items, and uncover a couple of hidden goodies is always a plus in my book.   Upgrading your characters is one of the coolest things to do. Stella Deus: The Gate of Eternity is a simple but solid jaunt through the realm of tactical fantasy. Boasting an easy to learn battle system and a difficultly level that isn't too tough, it's an ideal product to bring in new users to a genre that has consistently been one of the most satisfying experiences around. More seasoned players that have done and seen it all, however, may not find the game quite as inviting.But hey, let's be honest: given the fact that strategy/RPG fans are some of the most devoted followers around (of which, I am one of them), Stella Deus is still worth a look if only to check out its strong plotline and outstanding soundtrack. Just don't expect anything revolutionary or magical along the way.", "date": "May 5, 2005"}
