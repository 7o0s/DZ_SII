Just simply brilliant. This game is home to one of those concepts that makes you sit back, smile, and say, ~Why didn't somebody think of this earlier?~ It's a very simple idea, it's executed remarkably well, and it's a perfect fit for the touch screen tech on the DS. Crayola Treasure Adventures is a virtual box of crayons, and it transforms your Nintendo DS into a coloring book of nearly endless possibility.   Who doesn't remember spending hours of their youth engaged in the world of imagination that a simple box of Crayola crayons could create? Drawing and coloring are some of childhood's most innocent, universally appealing activities. The only problems you might ever run into were running out of paper, or using your crayons so much that they got ground down too short to continue their work. Digitizing both the crayons and their canvas for the DS eliminates those potential issues, and makes this package instantly appealing.   There are over 100 different coloring book pages to choose from in Crayola Treasure Adventures, each one featuring a fun scene with a dinosaur, a fire truck or some other simple cartoon character. The box of Crayola crayons you can open up is packed with 120 different signature shades. All of them match the real Crayola hues you remember: from standard colors like Blue and Red to the off-the-wall choices like Burnt Sienna, Inch Worm and Purple Mountain's Majesty.      You can color to your heart's content using any or all of the crayons, in two different styles  the default method of input applies the color to the page in a patchy, smudgy style that simulates the way real crayons work, while an alternate marker pen selector gives you the power to create smooth, even strokes. And, uniquely, there's no worrying about straying outside the lines in this design  the game will automatically detect if your stylus has gone too far outside of the current bounded region of your selected drawing and will keep your color safely inside the intended area. It's a novel addition, and makes things more fun, because you can scribble across the entire surface area of the touch screen to fill in a picture's background, for example, just so long as the first place your pen touches down is within the bounds of that same region.   The drawback to having a coloring book in video game form is that, when you've finished your latest masterpiece, there's no way to put it up on the kitchen refrigerator with a magnet. No way to print your work, or, more reservedly, no way to save your creations to cartridge memory. Crayola Treasure Adventures lets you play as a pint-sized Picasso, but your paintings are always lost and gone for good if you power off the game, or even if you just choose to return to the main menu to select a different page to draw on.   Additionally, not all of the coloring book pages and crayons are available from the beginning  you have to unlock the majority of them by playing through the game's story mode. That's where the ~Treasure Adventures~ come in. You play the part of partner to a talking, treasure-hunting Red Crayola, and together you go on a quest to track down the three stolen Color Crystals. Three black-and-white bad guys have taken off with the magic orbs, which are the source of all color in the world, and they're threatening to turn the planet into nothing but a drab greyscale landscape if they aren't caught and brought to justice.   Impressively, the Treasure Adventures story mode is even more engaging than the already fun coloring book. It's built on three core activities  solving jigsaw puzzles, playing Connect the Dots, and speed coloring  and it's got a fun and vibrant storyline that is simple, but hard to put down. The environments you and the Red Crayola travel to all look great, rendered in a visual style that matches the Crayola license very well, and the music is unexpectedly great. You'll hear up-tempo Egyptian-inspired themes as you traverse a dry, dry desert, and salty sea chanties while you hunt down Redbeard the Pirate. And while the activities are mostly basic and easy to complete, the speed coloring events provide some real challenge near the end of the quest. You'll have to scribble faster than you've ever scribbled before to keep up with the game's pace.A coloring book video game with a virtual box of crayons isn't ever going to trump the experience of drawing in a real coloring book with a real box of crayons, but Crayola Treasure Adventures asserts itself well as the capable digital counterpart to a traditionally analog activity. This is a game that could keep young artists occupied for hours, drawing, coloring and creating on their DS systems on long road trips, for example, and in other situations where having actual paper and actual crayons would be cumbersome or messy. Your creations can't be saved, which is sad, but that's really the only negative to level against this package  which is available for a budget price of under 20 bucks.Understand, of course, that this game isn't for everyone.  It isn't a mainstream Mario or Zelda adventure that will appeal to the hardcore DS gamer. But, for what it is, it's a blessing.  An edutainment title targeted at younger players that sets itself apart from so many of the other games that go after that demographic, by actually living up to the potential of its playful packaging.  Kids who get this game as a gift will be so much happier than those who get some of the other garbage that's being shoveled out and marketed toward their age range, so it deserves to be recognized with a higher score. Definitely consider this one as a stocking stuffer for the artistically-inclined younger DS owner in your life.  It's a brilliant idea.", "date": "Oct 20, 2007"}
