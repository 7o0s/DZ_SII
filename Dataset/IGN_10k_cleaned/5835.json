{"name": "Zoo Tycoon II", "name_review": "Zoo Tycoon 2 Mobile", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/20/zoo-tycoon-2-mobile", "text": "is a further result of IN-FUSIO's partnership with Microsoft Game Studios to turn the gaming giant's flagship franchises into wireless endeavors. The agreement has already borne the enjoyable Midtown Madness 3 Mobile, and the quality is certainly kept up with the release of this animal management enterprise.   When you put the managerial mantle, the zoo is a blank slate. No animals. No attractions. No guests. Starting out with a meager purse and limited installation options, you must build your zoo into a thriving -- and furry -- empire. First things first, you must adopt an animal and build a habitat it will enjoy. Zoo Tycoon 2 Mobile offers such gotta-see hits as rhinos, giraffes, panda, and tigers. Each of these creatures is nicely drawn -- absolutely recognizable, even on the smallest of screens.   Your first habitat will be small, just some grass and maybe a few in-cage objects. However, as the dollars roll in, you can further equip your stalls with more goodies to keep the animals happy -- such as additional greenery. The pleasure of the beasts is tantamount for success, and it will require more than material possessions to put a smile on their mugs. You should play with your animals (they seem fond of little colorful balls) and clean up their poop. Even minute details (not that rhino poop is minute) like this cannot be ignored, and the game keeps a running tab on each creature's condition.   Keeping animals happy will keep you in the black. The more money you rake in, the more animals and attractions are unlocked for use in the pursuit of even more filthy lucre. Oh, and the joy of seeing little animals on your screen.   In addition to the tycoon-style game, Zoo Tycoon 2 Mobile also has a photo mini-game that we found especially satisfactory. You are charged with snapping pics of the animals to complete Photo Objectives. The in-game camera will take snaps and if you have appropriately and artfully captured your quarry's behavior on film, you can access bonus content for the PC edition via IN-FUSIO's website.   We downloaded Zoo Tycoon 2 Mobile on a Sanyo 8200 this weekend. It's a capable device, but certainly underpowered when lined up against other heavy-hitters. Regardless, this has no effect on enjoyment of the game. Sure, we would have liked some snazzier graphics or better sound, but the fact remains that the game is most certainly intact. And that's what really matters.  Zoo Tycoon 2 Mobile is an excellent download for several audiences. Tycoon-style gamers will appreciate the genre's representation on mobile. Animal-lovers will enjoy seeing some cute species on their handset. And casual gamers will like that IN-FUSIO has made the sometimes overly-complicated tycoon genre infinitely more accessible. Personally, I enjoyed the photo mode -- but then again, I also liked Pokemon Snap.", "date": "Jun 20, 2005"}
