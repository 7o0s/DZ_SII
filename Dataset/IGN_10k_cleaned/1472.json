You know the kind I'm talking about. A geek walks into a club, sees the coolest cat there wearing a purple suede jacket. The next day, the geek heads down to the mall, picks up his own version of the suede jacket--the kind from J.C. Penney. He shows up the next Saturday night thinking he's the shizz, but he doesn't have a clue. The suave dude at the club wasn't cool because of his jacket. He was cool because he was cool. He had it. And our geek friend didn't. I am here to tell you one thing: Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 & 2 are the cool guy at the club, and MTV Skateboarding from THQ is that posing Poindexter in his faux suede jacket.  It's not that MTV Skateboarding is a bad rip-off. It's that it's a terrible rip-off. Grind Session for PSX at least gave its props to Tony, while being a playable knock-off. Such is life in the gaming industry. One team puts out a stellar product, and a bunch of profit-minded companies jump on the bandwagon and force something out the door. That's capitalism. That's America. But the folks at THQ have bastardized the fluid skateboarding experience of the Tony Hawk franchise beyond recognition.   MTV is headlined by Andy MacDonald, a great skateboarder who probably didn't know what he was getting himself into. There are several other riders here as well, including Josh Kalis, Colin McKay and Danny Way, but obviously the party is elsewhere. The weird thing (and this is indicative of the entire attitude of this game) is that these skaters are only available for certain modes. You are not given the ability to take them through a career (or Lifestyle as it's called here). Instead, there are no-name skaters who fill this role. The very least THQ could have done was allow you to create a skater who you would put through the paces.  Another game mode which is completely enervating is the MTV Hunt. In this mode, your skater combs the level searching for MTV logos. The object is to capture a certain number of logos without bailing. Given the terrible control scheme, this is virtually impossible.  The controls for MTV and Tony Hawk are pretty much the same, but that is where the similarities stop. And even though the button presses are basically identical, the overall control scheme is unresponsive and clunky. You don't really feel like you're in control of your rider, and after a couple minutes of aggravation, you don't care.   To make matters worse, riders do not interact well with their environment. When you ollie up to rail slide, there is a significant chance that you will bail on the way up. If you manage to land a grind, good luck. Your grind meter barely lasts, forcing you to leap out of the slide without stringing anything together. When you're on a ramp, you slow down significantly, and barely gain speed when you come back down. Have these people ever seen skateboarding? It seems not. The people a Neversoft built a halfpipe and the entire design crew went out and skated it. That's how you learn something about a sport. That's how you make a game better.  The animations are also horrible. Not only does your skater look ridiculous as he waddles, board in hand after a bail, but bailing itself is awful. It looks as if there are missing frames of animation. One second, you're upright, the next you're sprawled out on the floor, with no intermediate pictures. If you bail on a slope, that's where you will stay, glued in space and time. Ugh. And if you skate into an object, there is no animation to show you've hit something, your rider just stops cold. It makes you think the game has hung. Unfortunately, it hasn't. You still have to play.  Mom told me to say something nice, so here goes. The environment textures in this game are actually pretty good. In the Hovis Plant, a level which is a carbon copy of the Chicago competition from TH1, the surfaces actually look a bit better than in Hawk. There, I've said it. It's just too bad that the experience is marred so much by shoddy control that it is practically unplayable.  You'd think that MTV of all places could pull some decent songs together for the game, but here they fall short of Tony Hawk as well. There are some enjoyable tunes here nonetheless, including tracks by Cypress Hill, Pennywise, Deftones and System of a Down. One cool feature is that you can select the tracks you listen to as you skate. But it's too little too late.   If you already spent money on this, I'm truly sorry. Maybe you can get a couple of bucks back on resale. If you didn't, do yourself a favor and pick up Tony Hawk 2. It is the genuine article, not a rushed, cash-in game like this one.  -- Chris Carle, IGN.com", "date": "Nov 14, 2000"}
