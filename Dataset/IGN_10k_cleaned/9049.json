Airborne Entertainment tries its hand again at making the bizarro Griffin Clan interactive in Stewie's Arsenal, a mini-game collection that chronicles the toddler's efforts to finally eliminate his family.   Didn't the show actually abandon this plot line years ago? No matter.   There are four mini-game events in Stewie's Revenge, all of which can be consumed and disposed of within thirty minutes by the average gamer. A die-hard Family Guy fan may get a little more mileage out of the game, as it does a solid job mining the Griffin vibe. The in-game text actually reads like something that would fall out of Stewie's mouth, save for the absence of some of more ribald comments. The visuals are fairly spot-on for the smallest screen, with the characters and locations of the show making appearances.   The first mini-game is a Space Invaders-esque shooter set in Peter Griffin's brain. Stewie's little spaceship must blast brains cells, dumbing down his old man to the level of a parakeet. (Fans of the show realize that he's already dangerously close to that.) The second mini-game places Stewie in a runaway shopping cart. You must swing a bat, knocking groceries off the shelves while avoiding security guards and spills. The third game sees Stewie trying to plant a mind control device on Chris while the vil monkey interferes. Finally, Stewie must humiliate Meg in front of her Judgy-Judgowitz schoolmates by launching snowballs at her when they pass.   All four games are aimed at casual gamers -- but you don't need to draw a Venn Diagram to realize there's cross-over between FG fans and actual gamers. The fanbase will rip through this game in just one or two sittings, bringing its value into question.   The game offers a story mode where you play through each event in sequence. Every time you finish off an event (clearing several waves of increasing difficulty), you can then go to it directly in the game's arcade mode. This is a good addition, as players will surely find one or two of the events they prefer over the others and can just zero in on those.  None of these mini-games are horrible or un-playable -- it's just that they are exceptionally shallow by design. Too much hope for success is hung solely on affection for the source material. The very first Family Guy game, Stewie 2.0, succeeded to some degree because there was a clever strategy game behind the Family Guy window dressing. Air Griffin tanked because it was a one-note mess. Stewie's Arsenal falls somewhere between the two.", "date": "Sep 17, 2007"}
