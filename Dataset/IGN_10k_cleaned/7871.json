As you play, the game tracks a profile so you can compare yourself to the leading players.   At first glance, Mensa Genius Challenge sounds like typical entry into this now-crowded category. But for something branded with the Mensa name, which carries some baggage of its own, the presentation and mechanics are just not that smart. Whereas Gameloft's Brain Challenge has a series of visually stimulating puzzles designed to appeal to both brainiacs and those that use mobile to burn stolen moments, Mensa Genius Challenge is so spartan that it makes Nintendo's Brain Age look like Viva Pinata.   Yes, I know this is not a beauty pageant and that a game in this genre should be primarily judged by its puzzle content, but one of the primary ways to stimulate the mind is via the eyes. As for the puzzles themselves, Mensa Genius Challenge does nothing that other games are not already offering. The nine question categories include things like unscrambling words, fitting shapes together, mental math -- all very charted territory. (And since Mensa treads familiar waters, the austere presentation is even more noticeable.)   The questions within each category are broken down by date. When you first download Mensa Genius Challenge, you have a solid back catalog of queries and puzzles. Should you keep the game on your handset for an extended length of time, new puzzles are downloaded into Mensa from a server. When you play, the game gives you one chance to answer the question. You can quit out if you're not sure and do not want your score registered. When you think you have the answer, log back in and give the test another shot without losing any progress up to that point.   I tried Mensa Genius Challenge on two separate handsets with two different accounts to see if there was any difference to the puzzles. Everybody gets the exact same experience, so you're on fairly even footing when it comes time to be ranked. The questions themselves are not bad. I like language, so I did enjoy the word challenges, like analogies and antonyms. Math? Not so much. But I'm sure another player will have the opposite experience.  Mensa Genius Challenge sits firmly in the middle of the pack of the brain games I've played since first seeing Digital Chocolate's Brain Juice earlier this year. The category champ is still Brain Challenge as it manages to provide excellent puzzles with good presentation. Mensa Genius Challenge does nothing to advance the ball except offer a brand. If you're looking for a brain trainer for fun or for honing your mental skills, one of the smartest choices to make is to look elsewhere.", "date": "Dec 22, 2006"}
