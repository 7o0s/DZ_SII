It was one of those games where you would literally break controllers by throwing them against the wall out of frustration, yet keep going back for more because it delivered challenging, addictive game play.   When I heard that Capcom was bringing it to the mobile space, I confess to a slight twinge of dread. Not only did that mean having to replay one of the toughest games from my younger days, I was also worried that the quick reflexes the game demands would be muddled by being on mobile. Though these issues did occasionally come up, their impact was minimized as Capcom made some smart choices on the behalf of gamers.    The biggest issue that gamers will face is easily the difficulty. If you shy away from games like Ninja Gaiden or Battletoads, this is most certainly not the game for you. Though it's a straight-forward side-scroller on an absolute technical level, it still manages to be a tough test of twitch skills. Ghosts n' Ghouls is extremely taxing on your hand-eye coordination. You're constantly bombarded by baddies hell-bent on keeping you on your toes from start to finish. Normally, a game this challenging would be hindered by a mobile phone's button layout, but fortunately, there were some tweaks on the handset to accommodate the limitations of the platform.   For example, Capcom has included an auto fire function, so players have the ability to either attack once for every time the appropriate button is pressed, hold down the attack button to keep the melee going, or simply have fully automatic attacks, so when Arthur isn't moving, he'll be dropping hurt bombs continuously. It's a simple gimmick, but it works nonetheless and it is a greatly welcome inclusion. If you find that you're constantly perishing despite your best efforts, you'll be provided with plenty of lives and continues which allow you to continue your quest.   Ghouls 'N Ghosts proves to be a solid port. It manages to accurately convey the visuals and all of the various abilities of Arthur exactly as I remember it. The animations are fluid and the sprites are all faithfully recreated, helping to conjure some nostalgia. I was constantly reminded as to why I enjoyed this game so much in the first place. All of the weapons are present and accounted for, from magic abilities to the golden armor.  Though its difficulty may hurt its appeal to the casual gamer, Ghouls N Ghosts still manages to be a solid and entertaining title for those looking for a classic twitch challenge on their mobile phone. But hey, since when is saving the day supposed to be an easy task? If you have fond memories of this game or youre simply up for a challenge, Ghouls N Ghosts is a fun download.", "date": "Oct 31, 2007"}
