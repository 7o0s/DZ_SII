If you were raised in the suburbs, you can probably still remember the sound of an RC car as it zoomed down the street, like a mouse's blender put on puree. Some of you never forgot the sound, and upgraded to gas powered beasts, or traded in your old Tyco trawler for a high-end hobby shop racer. Or, if you're like me, you live on a busy street and keep your old RC car in the closet full of dust. Fortunately, we now have Re-Volt, a cheap solution for all those RC racing urges. And it's just like the real thing  frustrations and all. This may look like a console style racer, but don't be tricked. This is a fast-paced, fun simulation that will test your brain and your fingers as much as it will your reflexes.  Tal picked up Re-Volt and immediately loved it. I took a bit more convincing  the delicate controls had me fuming, and the levels seemed to be confusing and dense compared to most racing games  when you're driving through alleyways, sewers, and freezer cabinets, it can become an absolute nightmare. We both talked a lot about whether the game was hard great or hard bad  did I just need to master the levels, or did the designers tweak the game into impossible hell? I'm all for games which require a certain level of skill to master, but with Re-Volt it was hard to tell who was mastering who. At first, I felt like the only thing the game had to teach me was how to pound my fist into the keyboard. By the time I had beaten the Silver tracks though, I had learned one fat lesson: this was a great game.  Let's get one thing straight  the controls are hard. Don't expect to rip around polished kitchen floors and waxed museum galleries without spinning completely out of control. The designers have opted for realism, and in case you forgot, RC cars were a pain to control  touchy, quick, and delicate. Jumps may give you access to special weapons, but land the tiniest bit wrong and you'll be flipping into oblivion. The game is difficult because RC Cars are difficult to control, and if you don't remember, then try taking one out on a polished kitchen floor, and you'll remember just how soapy they can be on anything but firm tar and cement. But is it unfair? No. The game rewards practice in a really honest way. Though it's incredibly hard to beat levels on the first or second run, once you've learned the tilts and curves of each course you'll be taking 1st place easily  which is what good racing games are built on. It would be nice to be able to choose a more arcade style of control as an option (the arcade and simulation modes have more to do with collision control and acceleration than grip and steering in Re-Volt), but even so the game can be learned without a hefty amount of practice.  Re-Volt covers familiar racing territory -- from the main menu you have the option of trying out a single or multiplayer race, practicing a track you've already beaten, or taking on a championship race, which is the key to tackling the game. By beating championship races, you can unlock new cars and tracks, as well as get access to them in single race and practice modes. A stunt track lets you do a little airborne travel, and a track editor lets you put together your own masterpieces, if you'd like to add some of your own to the ones in the game.  The game takes advantage of the themes perfectly  racing underneath parked cars in a neighborhood and dodging beach balls in a gigantic toy store create a great impression of size  even the weapons help to make you feel like a lilliputian, with the ability to blast fireworks and water balloons at your opponents. The game puts you in a variety of courses which cover most of your childhood RC urges  a supermarket race, a romp through a closed museum, a dusty competition in a ghost town  even a cruise ship can taken on with your pint-sized vehicles. Weapons also fit the same theme, with bottle rockets and waterballoons serving as your artillery, and batteries (speed boost), teapots (oil slicks) and more allowing you to get the jump on your competition. Funky weapons have been done before, but never with such familiarity or humor. Launching a bottle rocket not only looks realistic, but it's damn funny. Becoming electrified and sucking the energy out of the other cars is a perfect solution to any of your summer blues, and you've been feeling the need to start doing household chores instead of wasting your summer away, watching an energy ball suck and twist the landscape at it tosses toys cars around like uh... toys, will convince you otherwise. Just like the racing style, the functionality of the weapons lean towards realistic. The tea slick doesn't necessarily spin you out of control automatically, but actually sticks to your individual tires, which means that if you race through a puddle with your right set of wheels, only they will be affected. As long as you play it cool and wait for the trail marks to end, you'll be fine. It's a smart option to add to racing games, and one that you don't see very often.  Instead of providing a huge variety of environments, Re-Volt has opted to create huge tracks that interlace like an LA overpass, allowing you to take different routes on different races. Toys in the Hood for instance, races like a miniaturized neighborhood romp the first few times  race under cars, over curbs, and through a drain pipe to a construction area. You may repeat short pieces of earlier tracks, but the maps contain enough branches and paths to make you forget you're even in the same, um, neighborhood. Even with the slight repetition, the reworked tracks feel fresh  and the designers throw in surprises later in the game, such as a version of Toys in the Hood which has you rocketing through the backyards and houses in the neighborhood  just try that in Need for Speed.  Multiplayer allows you to take on 8 or more cars (depending on your Internet connection) in a standard race to the finish, or in an incredible game called ~Battle Tag,~ which starts out as Hide and Seek and ends up as a freaky version of ~Kill the Pill.~ You must race to find a star on the map before anyone else, and after you've found it, keep it in your possession until your timer runs out  with one little problem. Any other cars that come near you when you have the star will pull it to themselves, so you end up frantically racing around cramped playground, gardens and supermarket aisles in an attempt to keep your enemies from finding you, or chasing after the sole car in possession of the star. It's as much fun as Midtown Madness multiplayer, and even faster in execution.  The whole game is filled with small touches that add to the convincing feel of the game. A gigantic train runs through the toy store, as well as a keyboard that plays tinkly notes as you race over it at full speed. Lawn sprinklers shoot out sprays of hyper-realistic water over the lawns of Toys in the Hood, and tumbleweeds hinder your progress in the old ghost town. Shiny floors, fresh cut grass  it not only brings back all the fond memories of RC racing, but adds to the gameplay as well. Sometimes the weapons act in odd ways (such as the bottle rockets which either flip cars or do nothing seemingly at random), and the tracks tend to get fairly insane later in the game  but overall, it's a fantastic, plastic ride. The stunt track is fairly useless however, and trying to get a car  any car  to get the bonus stars quickly becomes a monotonous task. Again, it's only a minor criticism. In the end Re-Volt plays like a champ, and works you out harder than a Jane Fonda video set on fast forward. If you've been meaning to take a break from the world of first-person shooters, or want something fast and bite-sized for your PC, this is a perfect addition to your library.  With Shadowman right around the corner, and Trickstyle coming up close behind, it looks like Acclaim has a busy September  and so do you. How are you going to find the time to play all of their great games?  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Aug 20, 1999"}
