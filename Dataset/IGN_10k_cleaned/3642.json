One is Super Mario Bros./>  The other is this gem.  Prince of Persia, born on home computers many years back, has endured as one of the greatest adventure titles ever--finding it's way on almost every conceivable platform since the old, back-and-white Mac.  In fact, there's a sequel on display at E3 this week.  But do yourself a favor, and get with the original first.  Features: Faithfully adaptation of the classic Rescue beauties for rewards Explore, swashbuckle, and solve puzzles   Get a bunch of twentysomething gamers in the same room, and within minutes they'll be talking about how much games were back in the day.  But in reality, so few of them truly measure up to memories.  Really, which would you rather be playing right now?  Shinobi on your PlayStation 2 or Revenge of Shinobi on your old Genesis?  (Wait, bad example.  But you get the idea.)  Prince of Persia, though, is one of those delightful old school games that manages to hold up perfectly.   And thanks to Gameloft's expert port, this Prince continues to perform in your pocket.  For one thing, the game looks precisely like to first color translations of the title, and in the case of the iffy 16-bit ports, maybe even better, despite being on such an small screen.  The sultan's palace pops off the screen is gorgeous color--especially on the Motorola T720 we tested the game on.  (Note: The upcoming Nokia 3650 version looks even tighter, thanks to the bigger screen that shows even more of your surroundings.)  Gameplay continues to be rock solid, as your intrepid adventurer navigates treacherous hallyways, desperately searching for seven kidnapped princesses.  (And who wouldn't risk their bacon for the promise of ~carnal delights?~)  You'll have to avoid spiked pits, bottomless abysses, and deadly trap walls that will slice you in half.  Of course, nevermind that the joint is a virtual maze with switches that open faraway doors, a hallways that end in dead ends.  And just when you think you've managed to master your domain, you gotta unsheathe your sword and make with the swashbuckling against seasoned foes.  Prince of Persia would be a daunting experience if it wasn't for the accommodating learning curve.  The first palace is a cinch, introducing you to a few of the traps and offering up a cakewalk of a swordfight.  By the time you reach the fifth palace, it's nothing but trouble.  Just take your time, get used to the controls--as simple as they are, it always takes time to get used to the feel of controlling with a keypad and not a control stick--and you'll be fine.  At least, until you get run through by a guard that out-swashes your buckle with the greatest of ease.  Perhaps one of the best things about Prince of Persia is that the game never feels like a cheat or that the odds are completely overwhelming.  It's all skill, just like any platformer worth it's salt, and once you get witht he rhythm and sensibility of the game, you'll have a hell of a time putting it down. Excellent.  Gameloft is quickly making a reputation for producing some the finest cellphone games, and this port of Prince of Persia is Exhibit A.  (Splinter Cell is Exhibit B.)  Any gamer that is growing tired with the basic, simplistic phone games that glutted the market when this 3G revolution took traction, needs to download this slick port to see just how good a cell game can be when be developer actually cares.  Kudos to Gameloft.  Kudos.", "date": "May 13, 2003"}
