The game's concept comes from Ian Livingstone, a veteran paper game designer and creator of the Fighting Fantasy series of flip books from way back when. But Deathtrap Dungeon is no epic roleplaying quest; gameplay falls very decidedly within the action/puzzler range.  Okay, the plot. Yet again, a mad warlord has set up a dungeon full of traps and monsters nearby his castle, challenging adventurers from the land enter this place at their own peril. The risks are great, but the rewards are plenty. This is one of the oldest plots in computer gaming, dating back to the days before the first Wizardry, The Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. Still, it's enough of a rationale to get the game going, and it does give the level designers an excuse to create fiendishly difficult traps that wouldn't logically exist in a fantasy world otherwise.  You play as one of two characters--a male warrior or a slightly more exposed female one. Both the characters look all right but when the female character stands in certain shadows, it looks like she had originally been modeled to wear a skirt, which was changed to a skimpier bikini brief later on. This seems just a tad cynical, even for a videogame.  The actual dungeons are pretty wide open, brightly lit for the most part, and visually appealing on a 3Dfx. However, as with all Tomb Raider games, the camera shifts around a lot to follow the character as they move around the room. On the one hand, being able to see the character is an aid for jumping puzzles and hand-to-hand combat. On the other hand, it's distracting if not handled well. Sadly, Deathtrap Dungeon is a really good example of the latter.  The control choices are self-explanatory: you can jump, move about, or fight, with several kinds of blows--side slashes, stabbing thrusts, or an overhead chop. You'll also find some magic items and powerful missile weapons to aid your quest. But control is a bit sticky in hand-to-hand combat--I often found myself staring at a wall, barely able to turn. Games like Interplay's Die by the Sword do a much better job of achieving playable third-person combat. Add all of this to the Deathtrap Dungeon's unpredictable camera movements, and you're talking about a lot of frustration and unnecessary deaths simply because you are fighting the interface as well as the monsters.  Even though all of this is really irritating, the single most annoying thing about Deathtrap Dungeon has to be the save game feature. You cannot, as in most PC games, save just anywhere. You must go to one of the save points, and save there. Unfortunately, in a game where the character dies quite a lot (it's a Deathtrap Dungeon, remember), this process becomes frustrating very quickly. Worse still, when you die, the game automatically reloads from the start of the level (a five to ten second process). At this point you have to hit escape, and then reload your last saved game, which wastes even more time. This is kind of insulting, like telling PC owners that hey, we're not even going to bother to play to your platform's strengths.  In the end, all of Deathtrap Dungeon's weaknesses just keep adding up until you are left with an unappealing game that boasts some nice graphics. Unfortunately, good looks aren't nearly enough to make a game worth playing. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
