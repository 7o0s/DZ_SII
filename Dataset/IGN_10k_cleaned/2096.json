There hasn't been a realistic shooter that has really gotten a lot of people excited around the office like this since Rainbow Six came out a couple years back. There is so much going into this game its just plain goofy. The more you delve into it and get used to the ultra brutal way that the AI comes after your sorry little hiney, there's an incredibly deep and fun game here. Unfortunately, I can't say that the game is without problems. I expected as much coming into it considering everything they were trying to pull off here, but some of the problems tend to go a little overboard on the frustrating side of things.  First off, this is the first game to come out shooting during the Cold War era. The Russians are back and they're out for trouble. The game centers over three islands that are the focal point of the Russians incursion into NATO territory. You'll have to play the game to get all of the details on the story because A) I wouldn't want to ruin the experience and B) I haven't been able to beat the incredibly hard final levels yet.  You will play as a few different members of Armed Forces as you make your way through some difficult and mostly satisfying missions. You'll start out as a common foot soldier thrown into the middle of pitched battles involving infantry, armor vehicles, different sorts of cars and trucks, and even some mines and satchel charges. It'll be your place to follow a computer AI controlled leader as you just try to survive to make it on into later missions where you switch characters and play as other folks like tank commanders, helicopter and plane pilots, and Special Forces units. Taking part in the game where you're not seen as some superhero sort of combat specialist is really intriguing and one of the reasons that I dug the story so much.  Each of the missions you play will start the same regardless of who you're playing with. First off, you'll probably see a little cutscene. These are actually something that I'm a little wishy-washy on. You see, they integrate the story into the game really, really well so that you do feel like your stuck in the middle of this war. But at the same time, it seems as though the folks creating the scenes didn't really have a hold on the whole timing thing. Cutscenes can last just a little too long sometimes... but anyway, after you've seen what there is to see, you'll be put into the briefing screen. This will give you a detailed overland map of the island you're on. You'll get enemy positions without knowing how much resistance you're going to meet as well as extraction locations, points of interest and all of that jazz. The briefings will also contain important locations that are highlighted links. When you click on these the map will actually move to that location so you can see where it is in respect to other places you need to go. Also on the briefing screen are notes written by the character you're playing, you're loadout screen so you know what you're carrying, and the list of who is in your squad.  Now comes the really fun part. You get stuck in the middle of the war in first or 3rd person. The first person is a much easier way to play the foot combat portions of the game while I found the 3rd person to be much more useful for the vehicular combat (more on that in a sec). What you'll find immediately is that this game is unforgiving, even on cadet mode. Switch to veteran when you haven't gotten a hang of things and you're toast. In the early portions of the game when you are under the command of the computer AI, you'll be given orders and be expected to follow them. This is hard to do at times, but generally is in your best interest. This is not a game where you are going to rush headlong into the enemy and expect to win the fight. Chances are there are a lot more of them than you. And in this game, you're fighting against soldiers trained to kill and they're good at it.   The AI certainly isn't perfect, but it isn't dumb either. There's a sliding AI scale that will allow soldiers to posses greater ability than others (the good ones are usually the officers so you'll want to off those to dumb down enemy AI decisions). They'll try to flank you, call in tanks, and pretty much do whatever to kill you. There is the chance that you can hide from enemies, but not forever. Bushes are a great place to hide, especially in camouflage as it will be much harder for the enemy to recognize your position, but once you fire, there's a good chance someone will hear it and you'll get dead quick.  A good range of weapons will be at your disposal in the game with any weapon you see on the ground usable as well. You do have a very limited amount of ammo, with ammo dumps located around in certain missions and locations. You'll also be able to heal yourself at medic tents, heal slightly from medics in your squad, and also from medic trucks following the combat.  Now before I go on too much, let's get into one of my favorite parts of the game, the vehicles. You can use any vehicle that you see in the game. Tanks, cars, trucks, jeeps, helicopters, A-10 Tank Busters, APC's... you name it you can drive it. Actually getting the vehicles to do what you want is a whole different problem however. Cars and trucks are generally pretty easy to steer. You can use the mouse and not worry about crashing. Tanks are hard to steer and hard to command. If you watch friendly AI tank squads try to find their way around the battlefield it'll be a little like watching Ivan the Intern try to ride a scooter. Motarded. They'll bump into each other trying to get in formation and generally look like Gomer Pyle is in charge. I had a hard time getting through these missions and generally tried to rely on my squad mates to take on the brunt of the work.  Then there's the airborne vehicles. These are also a little harder to drive, but can be a bunch of fun. The planes are a little easier, but the helicopter controls will definitely take some getting used to. They're simmy even if they aren't simulations in the strictest sense. Hell, the whole game is simmy. But they're still a whole lot of fun to try out and give a whirl.  Now onto one of the uglier sides of the game. I think Steve summed it up well when he asked, ~How can a game look so good and so assy all at the same time?~ The models of the vehicles and soldiers are actually pretty damn good. And the environments are huge! It'll take you a long ass time to get across the expanse of one of those islands, even in a vehicle. And while I'm glad they put so much foliage in the game in the form of large forests and lots of trees and scrub... well they're ugly as sin. Good from afar, but far from good, as they say. When looking over the expanse of an island, you'll be truly impressed, but get up close and personal to those trees and bushes and you'll be wondering at the explosion of pixels in your face. I can see why this is necessary though, and I for one am willing to put up with that so that the islands can be flushed out that much more especially considering the frame rate isn't the best in the world even with the ugly low res trees.  Animations are also can be pretty nifty. Guns are slung over shoulders, units have different idle and patrol animations, death can be unique... good job all around even if it isn't the best I've ever seen. Sadly, no animations for actually getting into and out of cars were included. For smaller cars, units just pop into and out of the vehicles. Unfortunately there are also some collision detection problems with climbing ladders and getting stuck on trees and buildings.   Sound is good as well. Units talk to each other and you letting you know when a soldier is spotted and have typical voices that sound like they're over the radio. Some of the voice work sounds a little goofy, but I was pretty pleased overall. Weapons fire is pretty standard, but the use of sound works well here when you try to pinpoint where you're hearing that gunfire come from. You'll also start to get nervous at the first squeaky sounds of the treads of tanks and other armored vehicles rolling down the road to squash you.  And multiplayer... wow, this is a lot of fun. We've gotten rather addicted to the experience shirking other duties around the office to play through some of the excellent co-op missions ~just one more time~ about eighteen times alreayd. Most missions make me wonder whether the real objective is just to see how long you can stay alive but even in defeat I've got a smile on my face. Other multiplayer games are also very fun with capture the flag, deathmatch, and free-for-all capture the flag making it in. It's very nerve wracking to have the flag in these games as just a couple of shots means your demise in most cases. Of course, you could just get your legs shot out so you can crawl, but how fast can you crawl?  And last but not least we have the mission editor. Already there are maps and missions out there to complete. Hell, there are even MODs up already with a community that will only continue to grow as American audiences pick the game up. There will undoubtedly be some very creative missions with this easy to use editor. There's even a wizard for multiplayer games that will let you start out with a pre-made mission holding some triggers and units already in there for you to screw around with.  So all in all, I really like Operation Flashpoint. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes realistic shooters and anybody else that has the patience to die a whole lot. This is one of the most complete war simulation games that I've ever been in contact with and is a whole hell of a lot of fun as a result. Yes, the game is very hard. No, it's not the prettiest in the world. Yes, there are some problems with both enemy and friendly AI. Yes, there are little control issues. But none of these things are enough to keep me from writing this review as fast as possible so I can get back into it and play ~just one more game.~  -- Dan AdamsWant to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Aug 31, 2001"}
