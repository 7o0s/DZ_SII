In fact, when one goes to sea in the winter months, one must resort to beating one's manservant just to keep warm. The Catch-22 of it all was that once one beats him enough to get one's blueblood to just the right temperature, he'll be in no condition to fix cocktails. Seeing as how generously beating the help is especially thirsty work, this paradox presents a substantial challenge to one's posh lifestyle. Oh what is a land-bound, aristocratic child of privilege to do?  Simple! Just have one's manservant wheel down to a handicap-accessible software store to purchase a copy of Virtual Skipper 4 from the commoners who work there. Though it lacks any convenient interface for beating the help, it does offer an outlet for one's need to commune with the sea and compete with one's social equals. Ha! As if.   Virtual Skipper 4 offers players the chance to run through a world-wide campaign of sailboat races, create their own races with a handy editor or even head online to compete against the other people who happen to have been interested enough in this game to actually pick it up. You'll find that the online arena is surprisingly crowded, particularly if crowds of French people surprise you. Searching for and joining games isn't terribly difficult, but it's still a bit hard to know what you're getting into until you actually jump into the action.  The challenge, for those of you who are too poor to have ever been sailing, is knowing just which sail to use on the line you need to travel. Each of the four boats simulated in Virtual Skipper 4 -- the America's Cup Class, the Melges 24, the Open 60 Trimaran and the Offshore racer -- offer unique handling options and different types of sails. The Open 60, for instance, is a real speed demon but you'll need to maintain a high rate of speed in order to have any hope of handling it in a turn.  Happily, Virtual Skipper 4 includes the tutorials that were so badly needed in previous versions of the game. The lengthy multi-mission tutorial will not only teach you about the basics of handling your craft, but will also offer up information on the different types of boats and some of the rules and regulations for racing. Some of the tutorials are a little obtuse, of course, and there's definitely room for further exploration of tricky concepts -- like who's at fault during ship collisions, when and why to trim or ease the sails.  A wide variety of tips and tools in the HUD will also have you getting seaworthy relatively quickly. There are lay lines on the mini map that show you the best angles of travel for the current wind direction and the sail you're using. On the main game screen itself, you can enable a small arrow that shows the direction of the wind. As you turn into or away from the wind, the arrow will turn red or green to indicate whether or not you're getting the most out of the sail you're using.  An extra little line on the mini map will even show you the direction you'll need to head after rounding the next buoy. This is particularly important for getting the next sail ready for the change in direction. Since raising and lowering each sail requires a few second's preparation, you'll want to make sure you're ready to go as soon as you're set on the new course. This ability to anticipate needing new sails and having them ready to go as soon as possible is what wins races.  The early missions of the campaign are super short and might discourage gamers who are looking for early access to a more involved single-player experience. The short two- to three-minute races are hardly enough to test more than the absolute basic sailing skills. It's only after sinking a good few hours into the game that you'll start to open up longer races with more opponents. (There is an editor you can use to create your own custom races but it would be nice to have meatier options right out of the box.)      Sadly, the other boats in the race are completely anonymous. They don't have any crews whatsoever and are simply referred to as AI1, AI2, AI3, etc. Even if the game doesn't allow for different personalities among the racers, having some persistent teams that you're matched up with in race after race would definitely give the game a little more life.   The game makes use of the brand new 2005-2008 ISF rules, rules that I'm not totally up to speed with yet. Things like rolling starts are still pretty standard but I'm kind of at a loss to explain how the game assigns fault to boats involved in collisions. In nearly every case it seems like I was the one charged with the penalty.  While the action in Virtual Skipper 4 seems like the perfect choice for hardcore sailing fans, we have to give some consideration to whether or not the title has any chance to appeal to a wider audience. In short, it does not. Virtual Skipper's authenticity means that it's only going to be compelling to a fairly limited audience. This is true of nearly every realistic sim on the market but sailing seems to have a narrower appeal. The pace of the game encourages your mind to wander more than it would in games based on NASCAR or civilian airline simulations. You should already know if you're the type of gamer who's going to appreciate the challenges offered in this game. If you're at all on the fence, you'll probably get your fill from the demo.   The graphics in Virtual Skipper are quite nice. The sails flap in the wind, providing a nice bit of life to the world while also providing you with intuitive feedback about whether you've picked the right sail for the right job. There's nothing quite so disheartening as seeing your Genoa jib go completely slack. The crews on your boat also move and function correctly, racing to raise and lower sails and then taking up position to balance the boat in the water.  Virtual Skipper 4 has some of the best water modeling I've seen. The waves and the whitecaps and the reflections create a completely convincing setting for the races. Better still, the character of the water changes depending on your location and the weather conditions. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the game models wakes so the ships seem sort of disconnected to the water.  The rest of the environment is good enough to maintain the rest of the illusion. Sure, the Golden Gate Bridge looks a little awkward and, sure, the cities along the coast are terribly generic, but it's enough to preserve the illusion. When you add in a solid 3D cloud model and some brilliant day and night lighting effects, the whole world of Virtual Skipper really comes alive.   All of this is visible thanks to a really wonderful camera system. Using either the mouse or the keypad, you can swing the view around to just about any angle you like, either close in on the side of your craft, or looking straight down from high in the air.  There are a few small sounds here and there to back up the action. Sails flap and waves lap as you move in close to view the action. The sound of lines running as sails are raised and lowered adds a little more to the immersion here but the overall sound palette is relatively bland and unnoticeable.Virtual Skipper 4 is definitely the best sailing game on the market. And while it easily earns that title owing to the fact that it's the only such game on the market, Virtual Skipper 4's convenient controls and attractive visual presentation would have it racing very near the front of the pack. Still, in the end, games about sailing have a very limited appeal. Most gamers will find the challenge of proper sail selection and observance of laylines poor substitutes for powerslides, rocket boosts and machine guns. I'm not knocking the sport of sailing here, but gamers who are considering giving the title a try should be prepared for a very subtle sort of excitement.", "date": "Feb 28, 2006"}
