Then, in the mid-'90s, a few daring game designers took a stab to unseat the software Goliaths from its throne, namely Looking Glass Studios with the impressive Flight Unlimited sim for the DOS platform. Other non-combat sims followed, with varying results, such as Sierra's ambitious yet bug-ridden Pro Pilot, Looking Glass Studios' beautiful Flight Unlimited II and most recently, Terminal Reality's luke-warm Fly!  Naturally, Microsoft didn't rest on its laurels either, offering new incarnations of its Flight Simulator series almost annually, not to mention a handful of expansion discs each year, as well.  Fortunately, this heated competition ultimately will mean better sims in the long run, and if Looking Glass Studios' third attempt is any indication, it's coming sooner than you think. Here's the skinny...   With Flight Unlimited III (FU3), flight sim aficionados can take to the friendly skies in the Pacific Northwest, with over 10,000 square miles of photo-realistic scenery derived from satellite data. In fact, along with the exceptional sensation of rolling elevation, the terrain is at a meticulous 4-meters per pixel ratio, the best resolution for any flight sim to date. Highlights include downtown Seattle (complete with an accurate depiction of the Space Needle and the Mariner's stadium), the snow-covered mountain tops of Mt. Rainier and all the gorgeous, green forests of upper Washington state. Hell, you can even fly over Microsoft's Redmond ~campus~ or Bill Gates' modest residence, if so desired. Owners of Flight Unlimited II may also import the San Francisco data into FU3 to fly down the west coast from Vancouver, Canada to the Golden Gate Bridge seamlessly.  Admittedly, I rarely start off a game review with a discussion of its graphics, but if you've seen this game, you'd understand why all the hoopla. Here's a few other noteworthy points to touch on regarding the visuals in FU3. The weather effects in the game are equally as impressive as the terrain. Snow, rain, lightning, strong winds and blinding suns all add to the ~wow~ factor, as does the adjustable day, dusk and night cycles. Want to take off in a Seaplane? While gaining speed on the water, you'll see droplets shimmy up the windshield a la Need for Speed! And lastly, FU3 is bundled with a scenery editor allowing users to create, trade or download scenery such as objects, buildings, airports and more. Though this feature is not apparent from the main menu, the manual provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to create or import custom scenery (or add sounds, AVIs, music, and so forth). Sure, there are dozens of third-party add-ons for Microsoft's latter Flight Simulator products but this one's included out of the box and it's surprisingly intuitive.  OK, So Where's the Gameplay, Guy?  In total, there are ten aircraft to climb into with FU3, ranging from a P-51D Mustang (WWII fighter plane) and Stemme S10-VT Motorglider to the blazing Mooney TLS Bravo and the chic Beechjet 400A (corporate jet), to name a few. As with past Flight Unlimited products, FU3's flight models for all aircraft seem incredibly accurate, thanks to Looking Glass' proprietary physics engine. It's fair to say successful sims seem to balance the fine line between realism and fun, and FU3 is no exception. The player can select or deselect dozens of options to suit the preferred experience, such as the use of Air Traffic Control (ATC), controlling stalls, air traffic, wind accuracy, turbulence, fuel options, and so forth. Casual gamers who just want to cruise at 5,000 feet over mountains, rivers and national parks may do so without even seeing a runway. The choice is yours.  One of the finer accomplishments with FU3 is the aforementioned ATC, a real-time, artificially intelligent and interactive service provided to the pilot to help avoid collisions with other aircraft during take-offs and landings. The manual does a fine job in covering the different kinds of ATC included in the sim, with sample scenarios and how to communicate back with the tower.  From the main screen, players can select a Quick Flight (with many adjustable conditions and locales), the Airport (where most of the meat in the game takes place) or the Challenges mode for predetermined , er, challenges to try out. With the latter, there are eleven varied scenarios to add some replayability to FU3. For example, you may be asked to whisk some suits to an important business meeting in less than a half or to rescue someone stranded in the mountains. With the ~Crimefighters~ challenge, you're ask to catch some criminals stealing from wealthy yacht owners alongside a lippy female Deputy Marshall willing to jump from the plane to stop the thieves. There's also a few ~Hoops~ challenges designed to test a pilot's maneuvering skills.  Novice simmers can take advantage of the handy tutorial section of FU3. While it's not a robust as Pro Pilot's full disc of video instruction, it does provide a fantastic walkthrough of all the important skills a pilot must be familiar with for a more enjoyable and realistic experience. At the end of each chalkboard lesson (complete with audio narration), players have the opportunity to prove they've retained the advice by climbing behind the cockpit. Beginner and advanced skills are covered.  A Bit of Turbulence in Our Test-Flight  While FU3 is a gorgeous, realistic and fun sim to sink your teeth into, there's a few shortcomings, especially for those whose computer may not be the latest and greatest.   Frame rates are noticeably slower than other recent civilian flight sims, likely due to the highly-detailed terrain. Ironically, this hurts the ~suspension of disbelief~ factor in FU3, unless you're running a high-end Pentium II or III with boatloads of RAM and a solid 3D card. Forget what the box recommends for system requirements  you'll need a fast mother to get the most out of this game. And get this  the player has an option to install 300MB up to a whopping 2+ GB to the hard drive! I tested the game on an older P333, with 64MB RAM and a Voodoo Banshee, and even with the max install and not all effects turned on, there's a number of noticeable hiccups and generally slow frame rate issues. Naturally, my experience was much better on a Pentium III 450 with 192MB RAM and a 32MB Matrox G400, and at the highest resolution (1024 x 768), but not all gamers have this kind of horsepower. Allegedly, Looking Glass Studios is releasing a patch at the end of October or early November to help resolve the frame-rate beefs.  The other faults with FU3 are trivial, but they include panels that aren't active (i.e. you can't click the controls with the mouse, but rather, keyboard commands only), there's no option to see the propellers on the older planes and some very minor bugs, such as flying right through buildings even with the collision option activated (curiously, you can do this with Flight Simulator and Pro Pilot, as well?!).  All in all, Flight Unlimited III is a well-conceived and executed civilian flight sim with dozens of customizable features. While Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2000, due out any time, covers much of the world instead of a mere 10,000 square feet, FU3 is a highly enjoyable  and stunning -- ride through America's lush northwest...all at a mere $40.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Oct 19, 1999"}
