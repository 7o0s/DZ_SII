{"name": "Clock Tower", "name_review": "Clock Tower", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/14/clock-tower", "text": "An evil killer known only as ~Scissorman~ is on the loose, and with ten bodies already occupying the local morgue, it's up to the player to find out what's going on and save the day in this new point and click adventure from Human. Clock Tower is a basic murder mystery in which the player point and clicks a number of different characters through the game as he attempts to bring Mr Scissors to justice. It's all about finding objects and using them to gain access to new areas of the game, or talking to people to get them to do something or give you something that again furthers your investigation.  Functionality-wise, the game is very easy to play, and the pace of the action is sedate enough that even the slowest of videogamers won't be left behind. Where the challenge lies is working out what exactly what you need to do next. Some puzzles are really easy - get one object, take it to another location to open a door to access the next part of the game. But some almost defy logic and test your patience to the limit as you point and click your way around the area you're in to work out what to do next.  When it comes down to it, Clock Tower could have been a great game, but it's sadly dragged down into mediocrity by some irritating features. On the positive side, there's a good FMV intro, decent sound, a reasonable interface, a great storyline and some genuinely scary scenes and revelations. But this is offset by lame-o-rama dialogue that totally ruins the atmosphere, patchy in-game graphics and some really tough puzzles that require almost trial and error to solve.  Those of you who enjoy point and click adventures will probably derive some pleasure out of this, even though it's not a particularly brilliant example of the genre. But for the vast majority of PSX players out there - me included - buying a point and click adventure is simply not even a consideration when you can play the likes of F1 CE, Colony Wars, Marvel Super Heroes, Abe's Odyssey and the many other titles out there that offer the fast-paced action, excitement and thrills I bought my PSX for.  I'm all for new games and new challenges, but not when they're as average as this.  -Jaz Rignall", "date": "Oct 14, 1997"}
