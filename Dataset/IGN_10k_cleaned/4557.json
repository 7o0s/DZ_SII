Several of us were. Back when it was released, we were actually taking time out of our weekends on Friday nights to sit around in the office where we had just spent 10 hours working in order to play a good game of Battlefield with the readers from the site. It was a masterful game that changed a lot of rules for the creation of team-based multiplayer shooters. Obviously, when we saw an icon of Battlefield Vietnam sitting on the desktop of an EA employee during a visit down to Redwood City to see one of the 1942 expansions, we got pretty excited. While Vietnam isn't exactly the friendliest of subjects, the terrain and type of warfare presented some interesting opportunities for gameplay. So the question is now that Battlefield Vietnam has been released, did it live up to all of our expectations of addition, innovation, and excitement?   The answer, in short, is mixed and a little confused. I don't like Vietnam as much as I liked 1942. That isn't to say the game isn't fun. It is. But some of the maps don't seem as focused, there are some balancing issues that are seriously perplexing to me, and while the graphic improvements are certainly appreciated and the game looks good, this game seems more like an impressive mod or an expansion than an entirely new game. And of course, as you might expect, there are also some mistakes, bugs and issues here as well, which for the most part are small, but can cause some problems. On the other hand, the addition of helicopters that have some fairly intuitive controls, moveable spawn points, and traps are all pretty cool. I guess what I'm saying is that the game is good. It's definitely still fun. It just isn't the bombshell that 1942 was.   The Landscape of War   One of the major differences to Vietnam as opposed to 1942 is a graphical one at first glance, but really makes a huge and obvious difference to gameplay. Vietnam is a lush and heavily vegetated area of the world. A lot of the actual war didn't actually take place in the jungle, but it was certainly a different arena than US forces had ever been in before. Likewise, Battlefield Vietnam is one of the first games we've seen that really tries to take advantage of this kind of dense cover in a multiplayer arena. Obviously now we've got Far Cry and Joint Operations waiting in the wings that manage to do foliage a little bit better, but Vietnam has done a good job creating the very tense atmosphere that this kind of setting brings. When you start getting pegged from ~somewhere~ in the undergrowth, things immediately get pretty hairy.   Video Review Want an even deeper look at EA's sequel shooter?

Using a lot of undergrowth is an interesting mess. It's fun and brings a new dimension to Battlefield, but it also means you're going to be dying a lot from some unknown location before you ever have a chance to get out of the way. Sure, it's war. Sure it's Vietnam. I know, I know... and I'm actually not really knocking the game for it, I'm just warning all of you that are thinking to buy the game. No matter how good you are, there will be some frustrating moments of getting killed by hidden foes several times in a row before you can ever get a shot off.   The foliage also brings another issue with it. One of the complaints some players had about Battlefield 1942, including myself at times, is that it was too easy to sneak around the front of battle and capture a flag in the back of the fight, right when one side seems to have wrapped it up. In some ways, this is pretty exciting because there's always a new fight somewhere and each of the matches seems more like a struggle. But it also can make you feel like you're running laps. The foliage only makes this easier, even on maps that otherwise would have been pretty focused along one or two paths.     The maps themselves are actually fairly varied and interesting; although I'm not sure all of them are focused enough in certain areas. I found myself wandering without seeing any enemies much of the time simply because people were all walking in different directions apart from each other. Maps in 1942 seemed a bit more focused in the fact that there were always areas you could find the fights. These chokepoints created by the landscape really added to the excitement and tension. Some of the maps in Vietnam are open to travel, including one of the city maps, Hue, which is another easy map to sneak around and capture a flag in the back.   At the same time, Hue is an interesting map for a couple of reasons. First off, it actually acts like a city and various buildings will allow players to set up sniping points and provides a real urban combat feel. What's especially cool is that Hue is visited twice. First the city is intact as both the North and South Vietnamese race to take the city. Secondly, the city is in ruins as the North holds it and the South try to retake it. Even though the city layout is the same, buildings have been destroyed so the landscape itself is much different and spawn points have been moved around. I really like these two takes on one particular map even if I still think both are a bit large for what should be an arena for constant combat like Stalingrad and Berlin were in 1942.    There are some maps with more ~objectives~ as well. For instance, in the Operation Flaming Dart, the North Vietnamese Army can knock out the South Vietnamese Air Force's control towers, which will actually destroy their spawn points as well. While it isn't necessary for the NVA to do this, it will severely hamper the SVAF's chances to win if they can't get a foot hold in NVA territory quickly. These kinds of missions and ideas make the game much more interesting. I just wish it had been done more than it was.   Entering Combat   One of the major points of contention from the first Battlefield was its infantry combat. I'm guessing that players will be a bit more satisfied with Vietnam than they were with 1942. The weapons add a bit more punch than they have in the past and ground combat is a bit faster than it used to be. It's still no Unreal Tournament, but it's less sluggish, even with the increased (and sometimes frustrating) reload times of weapons. Now soldiers will be able to shoot from the shotgun position of jeeps (very fun) and some of the classes will be able to set traps, set up static mortar positions that can be used like a stationary weapon, and even create spawn points using a shovel. The range is there for engineers, but combat infantry has some problems.   For the first time, I can't find any reason to be a soldier, which was my preferred mode in Battlefield 1942 for its versatility. But now, there's seriously no reason to play as a basic soldier when you've got the machine-gunner class. This guy not only gets an M60, but also gets a LAW. First off, the M60 is easily the best weapon on the game. It not only is very powerful with negligible kick, but also has an insanely fast firing rate, allowing the user of such a weapon to riddle entire squads with bullets. While it might not be quite as accurate as an M-16, it's accurate enough in controlled bursts to take out enemies at 100 yards. The fact that it holds 100 rounds and takes only a second longer to reload than the assault rifles with clips a tenth of the size makes it extraordinarily efficient at killing and an exceptional all around anti-infantry weapon.    The fact that you can get the M60 in a package with a LAW anti-tank vehicle makes you a veritable walking fortress. Not only can you take all the infantry out with your superb machine gun, but also can defend yourself extremely well against vehicles. This set-up has no weaknesses. You would figure that carrying both of these large and heavy weapons would at least decrease the running speed noticeably. You would figure wrong. Somehow these soldiers are imbued with extreme strength and stamina. I just can't figure any reason you would play as a different class aside from wanting to set mines or snipe. The soldier is obsolete.     The fact that the LAW comes with a good anti-infantry weapon also makes vehicles a pretty tough sell. Some will be happy about the fact that tanks aren't as effective as they used to be, but I always liked their power, even when I was on the receiving end of it. Tanks are more powerful than infantry, that's how it goes. Now that doesn't seem to be as much the case. I can tell you that I've shot shells into the legs of enemy infantry and had them skip off, gun waving in the air with giggles trailing in the wind. How is that possible? I don't know, but it bothers me. Where I used to use tanks, I now consider them deathtraps since almost every infantry you come across will have an anti-tank weapon.   Taking to the Skies   Yes there are planes in Vietnam, some of which are equipped with napalm (one of war's nastiest inventions), but they aren't the star of the air show. Instead, one of the big additions to the Battlefield franchise takes top billing. Helicopters were a huge part of the operations that went on in and around Vietnam and are unsurprisingly a huge part of this game.   The big question was whether they would be easy to fly. Helicopters are a complicated piece of machinery and have been handled fairly well in this instance. They won't be easy to pick up and use effectively, but controls are intuitive enough to allow new players to tackle flying soon and be successful at it for a little while at least. Once there are some players that really take the time to learn the intricacies of control, there's a good chance the helicopters could turn into flying death. The only thing ground troops have going for them is that these craft aren't as fast as planes and are therefore easier to shoot down.   Helicopters come in a few fashions including attack and transport vehicles. What's great about them is that it gives teams the option to quickly move large squads across the map to help out in combat or even give a quick attack to an enemy stronghold at the beginning of the game. They help open up strategies a bit more for the creative teams out there. It'll be interesting to see whether the game becomes any more unbalanced as players learn how to exploit these new vehicles.    The Sound of Fun   One thing that's definitely noticeable is the increase in quality of sound from Battlefield 1942. Weapons, explosions, vehicles and all of the little things are well done. The same sorts of voice-overs are back as well for each side, using the appropriate language for each side. Added into the mix this time around are soundtracks. American vehicles have the option to play the game's terrific soundtrack while driving around. Of course, it can help the enemy hone in on your position, which can be a very bad idea if you're putting around on a scooter.   On the other side, the North Vietnamese put up some nice morale humping propaganda to keep the GI's spirits down and their aim crappy. Of course, players in this game aren't likely to heed the warnings (even if the ones about your pilots not caring you're one the ground is probably true in this case) but it's really cool to hear in any case.   Single Player is Still Bad   I suppose the section title says it all, but it's really true. Those that are looking for a great single player game in Battlefield are going to be severely disappointed. After playing Unreal Tournament 2004 recently and seeing the level of AI displayed in that game, both tactically and skillfully, Battlefield Vietnam's AI is downright sad. It can aim alright at times but strategy and responsiveness is not good. Example: on the Cambodian Incursion map in the single player game you'll begin on the US side trying to stop the Viet Cong from getting across a bridge and capturing the closest US spawn point. The Viet Cong only have this one spawn point to begin with. So where do all of the AI spawn? All the way across the map where the US has the rest of the spawn points. Do they run to protect the spawn under attack from across the bridge? No. They just wander around like ninnies doing nothing to support the actual game.     Half the time AI will just sit back with vehicles, run into alleys or corners and just sit there, or run away from a flag that needs to be captured only to stop a few hundred feet away to stand there and get shot.   In short, don't play this for the single player game. It may run more smoothly than 1942, but that doesn't mean its better.   Some Little Things   It's probably no big surprise, but Battlefield Vietnam didn't ship without a few little problems as well. Little things such as running downstairs causing damage, five foot drops killing you, guns locking up (is this a design decision for the unreliable M-16?), and various other small bugs. However for the most part, things work and the experience has been smooth from a technical standpoint.  So is Battlefield Vietnam worth the purchase? If you're a fan, sure. It's a fun game. Does it bring the same overwhelming feeling of joy and freedom that the innovation of Battlefield 1942 brought to us? No. It's really not very different from the first game. The setting and engine changes certainly make a difference to the way the game is played, but if you go in expecting the same huge punch you got from the first one and the same lasting afterglow, you'll probably come away a little disappointed.If you're a fan of 1942, you'll have fun in Vietnam. If you've never played a Battlefield game and want to try, this is probably a good way to get into it with combat that may be more familiar due to the more modern weaponry. Hopefully EA will be releasing a demo in the future that will allow new players a chance to try the game out for a little while, but if you can't wait, I'm guessing most people won't be too upset by this purchase.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
