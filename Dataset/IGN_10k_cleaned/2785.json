The game has no story, no plot, it doesn't even have progressing levels (you pick a level and once it's finished, the game's over). However, what it does offer is a fun game and an original single and multiplayer experience. You're given a series of 10 hexagonal boards along with the goal of dominating each one. You can achieve Assimilation by either blocking your opponent's movements or by destroying their game pieces altogether. Assimilation also features the ability to play online with up to 8 players using Gamespy.   Gameplay is very simple and straightforward. By cloning or jumping into spaces adjacent to your opponent, you can assimilate the enemy's game piece into your own. This is pretty much the main goal of every level. You're also given special Tele-Port spots, which will move your game piece to a different location of the board. This is extremely useful in getting the jump on your enemy. You're also given three difficulty settings to help make the game even more challenging. However even in Novice mode you'll find yourself facing stiff competition in the single player mode. The limited number of maps are fun to play, but tend to get really boring, really quick. It would have been nice if the developers allowed the user to create or edit their own levels or even possibly allow for new level downloads from their site. Minor gripes aside, did we also mention that you're timed for each move you make? Thank goodness for this feature or the multiplayer mode would have become the biggest bore-fest of the year. The controls are very intuitive and are completely mouse driven.    The multiplayer aspect of the game is one of its biggest selling points and is pretty fun. But, I found the amount of gamers out there to be somewhat limited (at best) when it came to getting an 8 player game going. However, when you can get the people in there, this game becomes really fun. The concepts and rules are the same in an online game and you'll soon find out that a lot of it has to do with luck.  Hopefully more people will end up picking up the title for it's less expensive price tag and we'll end up having more competition out there.   Graphically the game is actually better than I expected. It makes use of various fun warping and color effects courtesy of Direct X, but at its core it's still a 2d game. You're also given the option to play the game in Windowed form, which makes it ideal for those really slow days on the job. Assimilation can also be played in most resolutions and can be minimized and maximized on the fly. But when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of it all, the graphics are definitely stale compared to the slew of premiere titles out there.    The audio is surprisingly crisp and really shines when necessary. The developers obviously didn't want to cut back with the sound, which is the first thing that goes out the door on similar low-budget titles. The few songs that are available are easy on the ears and don't get too repetitive.   I doubt that I will find myself playing this game too often, but for those who play the various pre-loaded mini-games on Windows; you'll find yourselves at home here. If you're sick of all those card games that come pre-loaded on your PC then go nab Assimilation and you'll find time doesn't pass as slow as it previously seemed. Sometimes you're just going to be sick of stories, plots, action, explosions, voice acting, and hot babes. That's when this baby will come in handy.", "date": "Jul 3, 2002"}
