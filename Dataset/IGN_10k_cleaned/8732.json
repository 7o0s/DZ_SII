{"name": "Boggle Plus", "name_review": "Boggle Plus", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/22/boggle-plus", "text": "Thinking of the right words in some situations is difficult enough, but doing it with a time limit makes it even harder. This is the essence of Boggle Plus, a Game Boy version of the classic board game in which players try to form words out of randomly arranged letters. Needless to say, if vocabulary is not your strong suit then this game might not have much appeal to you. But even those without huge vocabularies should find something to like in this game's simple but challenging premise.   Features  One of two players with the Game Boy Game Link  (sold separately). No game saves. No high score saves. Five different game boards. Average game control - the cursor does not move diagonally on game boards, often slowing down the player. Difficulty level: Easy, Medium, and Hard.   The Game Boggle Plus offers the classic Boggle game on either a small (4x4) grid or large (5x5) grid. In either version you can choose to play on your own, against another human via the Game Link, or against computer-generated opponents of varying skill levels. (One way to pick up some good, obscure words is to look at the computer-generated opponents' word lists once time is up on a board-you will learn neat words like 'ait,' 'hie,' etc.) Also, you can choose to play just one game at a time or 'tournament' style, in which you play until a player reaches a specific point total.   Other games included on the cart are:   ~Categories~-player must find words related to a specific topic, e.g.: sports or animals  ~Anagrams~-player must unscramble a small set of letters to come up with a word  ~Use All~-player must try to clear a 6x6 grid of letters as many times as possible in the allotted time.   All of the games employ a 35,000+ word Proximity/Merriam-Webster dictionary. This dictionary recognizes most words, with the exception of many slang and more modern terms. If you try to use words like ~fax~ and ~phat,~ be prepared to have your selections challenged by the dictionary. When challenged, you may have the dictionary either temporarily 'accept' or 'reject' the word. Up to twenty-five unrecognized words may be accepted during any single game. For the most part, the dictionary contains a good selection of words, but it is frustrating to not be able to permanently enter words into the dictionary database.   All of these games have a set three-minute playing limit. Anagrams and Categories offer three different levels of difficulty (hard, medium, and easy).    Needless to say, high-resolution details are not a big part of this game. The Game Boy's graphic capability is more than sufficient for a game whose main visuals consist of word tiles spread out in a grid format. If you are looking for eye-popping sprites and animations, this game will not satisfy. What it does offer, however, is clear, easily visible game boards that enhance rather than detract from the game.    The music consists of ONE sometimes annoying track that plays on the game selection and configuration menus. You can't turn it off, but you can turn it down. Thankfully, the music fades to silence during actual gameplay, allowing the player to concentrate on words and not on pointless background noise. Sound effects are minimal and mainly made up of robotic bleeping and blipping. This is truly a game that woos the brain, not the ears.    If you enjoy words this is a good investment, as the five game boards offer a wide range of word play strategies and challenges. One drawback to the gameplay value, however, is the fact that the game boards often seem to repeat. Play long enough and you'll begin seeing the same letter grids that you saw only three or four games ago. In many ways this waters down the challenge and diminishes some of the game's replayability.  Boggle Plus is an appealing game when judged on its own merits. As far as I know, it is the only word game available for Game Boy that is reasonably easy to find in stores right now. It offers a nice reprieve from platform, arcade, and sporting games that often require the fingers to work faster than the brain. Whether you are a casual wordsmith or a true word junkie, you'll find that Boggle Plus can suitably meet your level of lexical needs.
