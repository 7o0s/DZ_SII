It was Jordan Merchner's follow-up to Karateka, one of the first games to utilize rotoscoped animation (filmed from real-life, then traced over). This technique, along with cinematic cutscenes interspersed throughout the game, gave Prince of Persia a unique, movie-like feel. It was revisited as a sequel on the PC almost five years later, and has appeared on systems across the board. And the Prince returns to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color in his original adventure thanks to Red Orb.  Features: 12 levels of puzzles  Sword fighting  Multiple Languages  Password Continue  For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   At the start of the game, you're thrown in the dungeon. Bad prince. Apparently, the evil Jaffar wants to marry your beloved, and will either do so or kill her  and she has one hour to make up her mind. This puts 60 minutes up on the clock, and that's the amount of time you have to get through all twelve levels of the dungeon to rescue your sweetheart.  So, you're going to have to use both your brains and brawn if you want to get out of the dungeon. You can run, walk, jump, grab ledges, and  when you find the sword in Level One, duel with the guards. Each level is a puzzle  you'll have to figure out how to get to the next set of staircases to the next level. It's not going to be easy  pressure plates trigger traps, weakened floors will fall from underfoot, and spikes embedded in stone will make your prison life a living hell. This quest will take you quite a while to solve, since you'll most likely die and restart each level many, many, many times. Thank god for the passwords after each level.  The Game Boy version, especially when used in the Game Boy Color, looks just as good as the game did when it was released back on the Apple systems a decade ago. The animation still holds up, even during these days of 3D motion-captured gaming sprites. The only difference between this version and the computer versions is the control  the Game Boy programmer mapped the ~baby-step~ command to a simple button-press, instead of holding the button down and pushing in the direction you need to go. It's also a little more difficult to sword-fight in the Game Boy version, but that's half the challenge, isn't it? Prince of Persia will always be a classic. Many games, from Heart of Darkness to Tomb Raider, have based a lot of their designs on this game, and it still holds up after all these years. The Game Boy Color game is a near-perfect conversion of the PC game, and if you like action games with a hearty dose of puzzles, you should definitely pick this up.", "date": "Jul 21, 1999"}
