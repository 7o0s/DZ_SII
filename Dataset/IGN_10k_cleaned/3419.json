Take, for instance, any of the half-dozen PC titles released under the Red Storm Entertainment label during recent years.  Games belonging to its Tom Clancy franchise have traditionally set the standards of excellence for squad-based, S.W.A.T.-style warfare.  Sneaking through buildings, tossing flash bangs down hallways, taking out terrorists with one-shot kills -- everything about the genre-defining series consistently shines on the PC.  But for whatever odd reason, developers just can't seem to get these awesome PC shooters ported to the home console market without taking serious casualties.  Such is the case with Red Storm's first GameCube project: The Sum of All Fears.  Originally welcomed with loving arms as a quality PC title, the game earned top marks and an IGN Editor's Choice Award from our own PC sister-site.  As Nintendo fans, we were understandably excited to get our hands on the final playable GameCube rendition where we could be free of the mouse and keyboard controls and tackle the terrorist forces via our couches and field-ready WaveBirds.  But, sadly, the console curse continues, as our expectations would soon be ambushed by the shoddy craftsmanship exercised in this PC-to-Cube port.  Read on for our full mission debriefing.  The Facts:   Three modes of play: Training, Campaign, and Quick Mission  11 single-player missions set in various global locales  15 weapons, including handguns, automatic rifles, shotguns, grenades, and flashbangs  Complete missions with the help of AI-controlled teammates and squads  Track and view campaign statistics   For 1 player only  Gameplay Having played the excellent PC version of The Sum of All Fears, we knew outright that certain things would be sacrificed and lost in the GameCube translation.  We knew that the precision sniping afforded by an optical mouse would be slightly dampened via the left analog thumb stick.  We expected to find simplified controls mapped to the GameCube controller where the 101-button keyboard once stood.  And we certainly didn't expect to take our Cubes online and complete missions cooperatively with a team of buddies.  But the gameplay mess that the Ubi Soft development team pushed into this Nintendo packaging delves to far lower standards and is truly a disgrace to the Tom Clancy name.  Unlike the PC version, the console game only supports a first-person view, but this is not your typical first-person shooter.  Tom Clancy games are typically more reality based, with slower player movement, longer reload times, and one-hit kills.  The same is definitely true for the Cube version, but to a much more painful degree.  Despite varying degrees of controller sensitivity, the onscreen action is agonizingly sluggish and non-responsive.  Successfully aiming at a target and getting a shot to its midsection is near impossible without the aid of the CPU-assisted auto-aim features.  Players can choose from ~snap,~ ~full,~ and ~off~ -- and we highly recommend using at least the snap mode, where your crosshair will magically overlay nearby targets.  Playing without this assistance is near suicide, as the CPU-controlled terrorists have much quicker reflexes than your Cube controller will allow, and your mission failure rate will skyrocket without it.  The unfortunate trade-off with this setup is that the game now becomes excessively easy, allowing gamers to openly walk into rooms and plug armed guards with little effort given to aiming at them.  There's something especially wrong with a tactical shooter when the shooting component is simplified to such extreme levels, and the end result is a game devoid of any true test of skill.  When firing up the Training mode, players will become familiar with concepts such as walking, opening doors, firing automatic machineguns, and detonating grenades.  There's really no point in detailing the entire control layout, as mastering it will take even the most novice players minutes, if not seconds.  The R button shoots, the A button interacts with your surroundings (e.g. opening doors, using a terminal, etc.), and L cycles through your weapons.  Sure, there are other buttons for fancy things like night vision goggles, ducking, and leaning, but we found little use for anything other than a twitchy trigger finger and basic map-reading to get us through all 11 missions.  And thankfully, we were able to get through all 11 of these sluggish, simplified, and generally unimpressive missions due to even more console-specific simplifications.  Forget having to deal with any pre-mission planning elements or real-time squad coordination as you raid a building.  Instead, players simply need to be able to follow a single white line through a detailed, overhead floor plan that connects starting point A to final objective D.  The entire experience is much like being led through an underwater maze with a piece of string tied around your waist that continually pulls you forward to the end.  Easy?  You bet.  Exciting, challenging, and fun?  Not even close.  This basic gameplay definition alone should be enough to clue most educated gamers into the fact that this game is far from gripping, so we won't bother detailing other fatal flaws such as its glitchy AI, mindlessly scattered enemies, and repetitive environments.  There's no point in harping on the lack of cutscenes, weak presentation, or the 30-second main menu load times.  In fact, there's really nothing much that we can say that will bring honor back to this once highly-decorated videogame veteran, so we will simply let its memory rest in peace as we sadly put this GameCube version of Sum of All Fears to rest.  Graphics We're realists, so we're not expecting high-end PC visuals with our GameCube ports of titles such as The Sum of All Fears.  Things such as high-resolution textures, complex lighting effects, and even high-count polygon models would all be understandably toned down a bit to keep the action running smoothly on Nintendo's hardware.  But when a developer strips a game of everything that was once beautiful, we feel the uncontrollable need to softly weep as we stare in disbelief at the sad, bare onscreen imagery.  Such is the case with The Sum of All Fears.  Gone are the nicely detailed environments, and instead we find indoor hallways that are minimally dressed to resemble their real world counterparts.  Even doors can't spare the extra polygons for things such as doorknobs -- flat textures have instead been substituted to trick the mind's eye, but not convincingly.  The lighting is bland, the framerate is inconsistent, and effects such as explosions resemble anything but a deadly burst of shrapnel and smoke.  If there was little reason to suffer this title for its gameplay, it certainly wouldn't be for its severely antiquated and embarrassing visuals.  Sound And sadly, the same can be said of the game's stunningly poor sound.  No doubt the development team had some kind of access to the audio assets used in the superior PC version, so we have no clue how the end results on the Cube could have been this ridiculously inferior.  Machinegun fire sounds more like a fully-automatic stapler, with high-pitched, echoey clinks and clanks defying our expectations of what a standard rifle would sound like.  All bursts of action and snips of voices are packed into the dreaded tin can and are poor by even N64 standards.Ever since catching The Hunt for Red October in theatres back in the day, I've been one of the patriotic many that have been hooked on all things Clancy.  When Rainbow Six first launched on the PC, I was taken by its depth, strategy, and precise tactical control.  Red Storm is universally equated with quality shooters in my mind, and so it truly pains me to look forward to a game such as The Sum of All Fears on GameCube and then feel as betrayed and disappointed as I am now.  This is not the way we prefer to experience our Tom Clancy universe, and frankly, I'm a bit saddened by what Cube fans must settle for in this neglected PC port.  Please do not be enticed by its stylish olive-drab packaging when you find this title sitting on store shelves, as it will surely do the same to you.", "date": "Feb 5, 2003"}
