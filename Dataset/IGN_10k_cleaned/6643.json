Why luck? Well, even though college hoops wasn't delayed, it's good timing to have this out on the shelves, since the NBA has decided to start up again.  With Final Four, you'll get all of the features you'de expect from a 989 sports game, plus a few extra sweet touches. The biggest of these is the touch shooting feature, which enables you to hone your skills and polish your shots. It's a nice addition to an already excellent game.   Probably one of the first aspects of the game is its easy-to-maneuver-through menu system. Unlike other basketball games, this one doesn't have any noticeable load times, nor is it filled with too much ~stuff.~ On the other hand, the competitor's college hoops game has a lot more options and choices that make it a practical encyclopedia of college information and selectable items.   Graphically, NCAA Final Four has sharpened up into a fine looking title. The overall colors are bright and realistic, resembling the college environment accurately, and the court is shiny and crisp looking as well. The players animate extremely well, and are full of great movements, from cross-overs, to real-looking defensive jumps and fade away jumpers, to kick-butt rim-breaking slams. Final Four also digs in with great college team play, enabling teams to run plays on offense and defense. From the controller, you can let fly sweet give-and-go's, high post set ups, motion-style plays, and other formations.   The game provides gamers with four gameplay modes, Quick Start, Exhibition, New Season, and New Tournament. If you simply want to skip all of the decision making and start immediately, then a Quick Start button gets you going. Of course, you don't get to pick teams or areas, but you do get to start ASAP. Just tap Quick Start on the main menu and boom, you're on the court and flying.   Final Four has all 250 division 1 college teams, and it provides players with both the away and home jerseys. As usual, 989 has done a great job with Final Four's sound quality. The crowd chants and screams, and reacts to the momentum of your team. With the ~6th man meter,~ you can rev up the home crowd to a heavenly roar (or it can be done to you), making or breaking your concentration and momentum.  As with any respectable sports game, Final Four has its fair share of options and choices. Final Four is also hot on stats, including teams, polls, standings, and award stats, as well as an injury report. The options are also good, and include everything from standards like half-length, injuries, fatigue, auto replays, and game speed to difficulty level and the choice of replay color.  Final Four is a one- to two-player game, and with two multitaps, gamers can play with up to eight players. Though it's not analog compatible, Final Four makes use of the dual shock vibration.It's a tough choice between this and EA's March Madness. EA's game is actually a more complete monster with more camera angles, more choices and more of the little things. In many ways, March Madness' players look better, but only in slow motion and replays. Having played through Final Four for a while now, I have to say the motion of the players, the smooth frame rate, excellent graphics and animation sequences are quite good, exceptional in fact. The gameplay in Final Four is as solid as can be; it's sharp, fast, and clean. I'm not stunned by the touch shooting feature, but I like it overall. I know this sounds like I'm copping out, but I like this for many reasons, and I like EA's game for others. For straight-out gameplay and graphics, this puppy is a fine contender, probably the better of the two, but for little details, more options, and overall control over my whole season, I like March Madness.", "date": "Jan 14, 1999"}
