Even if you've played it before on the PS2 or Cube, you'll still want to download Alien Hominid on Xbox Live Arcade. There's something about it that makes Alien Hominid not just a fun game, but also an excellent fit for the XBLA. Whether it's the classic level of difficulty, the great sense of humor or the perfect combination of both, we can't say for sure. All we know is that you want this game. We want it.   Alien Hominid draws inspiration from its predecessors, most obviously Contra and Metal Slug, but injects a healthy dose of style and originality that gives it an identity all its own. Shooting is the name of the game here. Lots of it. As the title Alien, it's your job to piece together your spaceship and enact revenge for being blasted out of the sky. Blockheaded kids will occasionally give you some handy power-ups, but you'll have to rely on your laser gun for most of the work. There are a few little moves you can perform, such as jumping on an enemy's shoulders and biting his head off or whipping out a knife for close encounter kills, but the main gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's simple, but there are enough quirks thrown in to keep things fresh through the entire game.   Those quirks come in the level design, which is spot on. Hopping along the roofs of cars on a speeding highway, riding a snowmobile through an obstacle course while attacking a train, or taking control of a giant yeti; it's all just part of the game. If you've played your share of classic side-scrollers, you'll have passing feelings of dj vu that will last about a second before the difficulty forces you to stop trying to remember where you've seen something like this in the past. It all feels oddly familiar, yet totally fresh.     If there can be any harsh criticism leveled at Alien Hominid, it would have to be directed at its difficulty which ranges from insane to impossible. A single shot from an enemy is enough to end your life and those little balls of death hurtling your way can easily be lost in the vibrant backgrounds. There's no way around it -- you will die very regularly and be forced to use nearly all of your continues to finish just a single stage. Occasionally, you'll find yourself in situations where death is the only option. Practice makes perfect, but this game can be brutal even after many hours of playing.   Give me back my ship. A second player can hop in at any time for co-op action (offline only), though it hardly makes anything easier. In fact, we found it harder than ever at times since a second player only adds to the onscreen confusion. Thankfully, you can load any level you've previously reached and begin with a clean set of continues, ensuring that you'll be able to keep progressing through the game in spite of itself.    The hand-drawn art looks crisp and better than ever running in HD. This isn't the most technically proficient game ever made, but the inviting art style and quirky humor built into everything from the backgrounds to the animations will make you sit back and wonder why we don't see more 2D shooters these days. All it takes is one look at the little guy's smiling face as he rides in a tank blasting oversized cannonballs at his foes, and any anger you may have had from dying incessantly will instantly melt away.    Alongside the 16-stage game are eight minigames to be unlocked, including a massive set of short little platforming stages called PDA games. Some of these games can be played through Xbox Live, but most are a solo affair. Outside of the PDA games, which can be played for hours if you enjoy their simplicity, the minigames aren't much more than a distraction. But, hey, they're still a nice bonus on top of the great campaign.   The achievements, like the game, are tough as nails. There are a few that are easy, though this is hardly a game for anyone looking for an easy 200 points. Most are centered on the main game, but you'll have to become an expert in a few minigames to get every achievement.    At 800 Microsoft Points ($10 USD), deciding whether to download and give Alien Hominid a shot is an easy choice. This game is such an excellent fit for the Xbox Live Arcade that you'll want to try out the demo at the very least, even if shooters aren't your cup of tea. The game oozes style and humor out of every wound the alien leaves in his wake of destruction. It's hardcore on the level that may discourage some, but it has the most important quality a game can have as well: It's fun.", "date": "Mar 2, 2007"}
