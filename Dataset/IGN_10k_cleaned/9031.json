As evidenced by the recent hit movie, top rated cable TV show, and inescapable merchandising, Rugrats is proving itself to be one of the most popular children's franchises around. And, since one of the unwritten laws of the videogame industry states, of course, that any successful media property merits a licensed game, it was an inevitability that such a Rugrats inspired title would eventually find its way to the N64. Now it has finally arrived in the form of Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt. Aimed squarely at young children, Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt takes the form of a video board game a la Mario Party. Unlike that title, which was flawed but ultimately fun, Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt is a dull, sloppy mess which not only embarrasses everyone involved but manages to tarnish the very license it meant to exploit.  The Facts  Three different game modes offering cooperative and competitive play. One-to-Four-player alternating play. Play as one of four popular Rugrats characters. Dialogue samples recorded by actual voice artists from the show. Random generation of board layout and object placement.  Rumble Pak support.     Gameplay The gameplay at the heart of Rugrats is incredibly simple -- really nothing more than a  turn-based board game. With such an elementary gameplay model serving as the backbone, it would seem difficult to bungle the job too badly. But due to some design decisions ranging from the incomprehensible to the downright bizarre, Rugrats manages to fail on nearly every level. Players can choose from four different characters (Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil) and have access to three different game modes, each of which as insipid as the titles suggest: Angelica's Temple of Gloom, Pirate Treasure Hunt, and Reptar Rally. Each mode can be played with 1-4 players, though anyone with a will to live is advised to avoid solo play at all costs. Remaining player slots not in use by human players can be filled by the computer AI or turned off entirely. There is little in the way of options or customization other than the ability to hide game tiles, which are then only uncovered when landed on by a player, and the choice of small, medium, and large game boards for the Angelica's Temple of Gloom and Pirate Treasure Hunt game modes.  Angelica's Temple of Gloom and Pirate Treasure Hunt are essentially the same game, with the same mechanics, differing only in focus and cosmetics: Angelica's Temple of Gloom is a cooperative mode set in an ancient Aztec temple, with the players against the evil, scheming toddler Angelica (basically human players vs. AI), while Pirate Treasure Hunt is a competitive mode in which the players work against one another in an undersea shipwreck. There is no fair, random way to determine player order -- player one always moves first, player two second, and so forth. In both modes the game is played the same way: spin the spinner and then move the allotted number of spaces on the board. The game board itself is made up of a series of tiles, each of which has a different result when landed on -- for example, sandbox tiles offer protection from other babies, cookie tiles give or take away cookies, and toy chest tiles allow the player to trade cookies for Toy Cards (which can be used for such purposes as teleporting babies around the game board, obtaining protection from Angelica or other players, or increasing movement).    The ultimate goal is similar in each game: players win by being the first to collect a series of objects obtained by searching the game board (statue fragments in Angelica's Temple of Gloom and, fittingly, pirate treasure in Pirate Treasure Hunt). Players can search when their baby lands on a search tile, when they land on a tile occupied by another baby (in Angelica's Temple of Gloom), or they can pay cookies to their friend Susie to search for them (during Pirate Treasure Hunt). The player is then allowed to examine a hiding place in the room to see whether an object resides inside.  Actual gameplay is ploddingly dreary. The pace of the game is numbingly slow, especially when playing with three or four people. Part of the problem lies in the fact that players just aren't able to accomplish very much in one turn. Simply walking from one room to another takes a few turns at least and, since the different objects players need to collect are often spread across the game board, they are forced to spend a lot of time endlessly trekking around. Compounding this is the necessity of searching the rooms for the various pieces, in itself a very slow and tedious process. The designers also saw fit to throw in a bunch of nearly useless non-player characters for the sake of the license. These characters, which are supposed to interact with the players (e.g. Angelica shakes you down for statue pieces, Grandpa offers you cookies, and Spike the dog gives you a ride on his back), end up doing nothing more than slowing down the game even more. Following the players' turns you are forced to watch senile old Grandpa, Spike, and Angelica or Susie (depending on the game mode) wander around the board aimlessly, stumbling along from one room to another due to the horrible AI.    There are so many strange, unnecessary design decisions present in this title it's hard to decide where to begin. Particularly (un)worthy of mention is the bizarre ZZZZ meter, which acts as some sort of measure of baby energy. This ZZZZ meter slowly dwindles during play and upon depletion the player's baby is sent to the crib for a nap, effectively losing the next turn. Probably meant to add some much-needed depth to the gameplay, the ZZZZ meter just ends up being annoying. Even more inexplicable is the ability of the player to trade in cookies for ZZZZ energy and vice versa -- these babies somehow have the ability, via some arcane alchemy, to transmute energy to matter!        Words can't even begin to describe the horror that is Reptar Rally mode. This mode, in which players have to collect candy in the Messyzoic Era, is so incredibly boring and ill-conceived that we had to force ourselves with enormous effort to finish the game. Unlike the other modes, in which players at least had the ability to move around on a board, in Reptar Rally the players are confined to rings in which all movement is one way.  Basically, the only interaction available is when you decide to stop the spinner. The rest of the time you sit around and watch your character move. There's absolutely no skill involved whatsoever and, predictably, no fun either.  Graphics The graphics in Rugrats are perfunctory at best. Character models are all rather low-poly and sport wooden, unspectacular animation. The game environments, while rendered in 3D, nevertheless seem very plain and spartan with little detail, dull textures, and limited color depth. In a game aimed towards young children you would expect colorful graphics and lively animations but disappointingly these are absent. The graphics in general just lay there, flat and lifeless, another sub-par element in an staggeringly sub-par game. As if the overall drab nature of the graphics wasn't enough, technical flaws are present as well. There are occasional problems with clipping and choppy frame rates, inexcusable in such a simplistic game where the players and camera are so constrained in terms of movement.  While kids might get a kick out of seeing their favorite characters on screen, everyone else will be bored to tears.  Sound The sound is similarly underwhelming. While it is true that the actual cast of show recorded all new dialogue for the game, the voice samples are in mono and ended up very low-quality and rough sounding. Some of these samples are repeated often during the course of play and come to be quite grating after awhile. In fact, after the thousandth repetition of  ~A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do!~ you'll be ready, as we were, to hurl yourself from the nearest freeway overpass. The music, composed by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh (who also scores the cartoon), actually isn't so bad. It manages to accompany the game in a manner that is understated and unintrusive, with tunes in keeping with what you would hear on the show.This poorly designed, lazily executed game is ultimately unsatisfying to everyone. Young children will quickly be bored from the slow pace and frustrated by the unintuitive game mechanics, while more experienced gamers will balk at the simplistic play and juvenile subject matter. Equally lacking in fun whether played alone or as a group, Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt is guaranteed to disappoint. The gameplay is so monotonous that when I played it with a group of people by the end of the game nobody even cared who won anymore-- they just wanted it to come to a merciful conclusion. Tedious gameplay, in conjunction with substandard graphics and sound, adds up to an atrocious game which actually manages to injure the Rugrats license.The only people I could possibly recommend this game to are diehard Rugrats fans who might enjoy seeing their favorite characters and hearing the voice samples. Everyone else is advised to stay far, far away. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer game enjoyable by both children and adults alike, check out Mario Party. Don't even bother renting this travesty.", "date": "Jul 7, 1999"}
