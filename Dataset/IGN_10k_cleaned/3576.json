{"name": "Wingnuts: Temporal Navigator", "name_review": "Wingnuts Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/04/07/wingnuts-review", "text": "I'm all for nostalgia. Seeing me curl up in a little ball and weep for hours on end while grasping my high school prom flower after work is terribly sad proof enough of that. But when it comes to games -- games that I can play for free, on my GBA, via some emulator, or as part of a Java applet -- I don't so much care to spend $25. Would you like to spend $25 for Wingnuts Temporal Navigator? Don't worry your pretty little head, sweety, Wingnuts is not as insanely in-depth and complex as it sounds. You won't have to navigate a damn thing, let alone some kind of temporal thing, and a cute drawing of a girl will refer to you as Wingnut occasionally (her voice is cool). Other than that, it's pretty much Time Pilot 2003. On the plus side, you do get to waste away the hours you would have normally spent staring at the wall and barking at school children by shooting, flying around a big looping square and wondering why you wasted so much money on something that should so clearly be left on the edge of Outback restaurant tables as a coaster.   When I enjoy a frosty brew at my IGN funded homestead, I like to leave it on a solid coaster so to not damage the chic white plastic that is my posh computer ~desk.~ Normally I grab Fran's flipbook of ~precious memories~ or collection of family photographs to absorb the dripping liquid, but sometimes I need something to put my feet up on. In those circumstances, I find CDs to be satisfactory replacements. This is where Wingnuts comes in handy. It's durable enough to sit on my desk and absorb condensation for years without melting or shattering, and it's not something I'll ever, ever be worried about destroying. So, it's pretty much like the tangible memories of Fran, only more expensive.  Why would I be so callous? Wingnuts is a rip-off, pure and simple. I've already pretty much summed up the game when I threw out the Time Pilot reference in the strapline (it was an arcade game that was around when I was but a wee lad of two), but I'll dust off this pointless string of text with a bit of a description. You command a rocket ship of some unknown origin and for some unknown reason have apparently traveled back in time to fight above the vast oceans of France and Germany, slaughtering a whole lot of antiquated planes, by your rocket ship standards, anyway. It's all top down, all worse looking than classy Java games, and all very much 1982. Fly around in circles across an environment that will loop if you get too far to one side, and blast stuff. You can strafe, hit the afterburner, turn, and shoot in a small variety of ways. That is all. Each level represents a year in time, you get points, and you fight some crazy guy with gray hair called the Baron, who is apparently bent on taking over the world with his mighty robotic planes. Episodes of Digimon make more sense.  I did manage to learn a bit more about the game's intriguing back story by reading the back of the box and checking out the official website. Since they provide the only information you'll ever receive on the subject, check it out: ~Can you catch Baron von Schtopwatch and his time-travelling airforce before it's too late?   Take-off from your aircraft carrier and hunt the Baron's robot planes in 30 levels of arcade action.~  You mean I can't even take satisfaction in knowing I'm killing people? These are robots?  Look at the screenshots I've attached, light $25 on fire, and then make bleeping noises and call yourself ~Wingnut~ and you'll be getting just as much enjoyment out of your time as you would playing Wingnuts. If you still insist on seeing something move, download a copy of MAME and check out Time Pilot and then pretend it's somewhat prettier and has a somewhat different control scheme (left and right turn instead of rotate and then move).  If I may, I'd like to fill this space with something that will perhaps bring a little joy into our now sad lives. Take it away, Harry!  Shake, shake, shake, Senora! Shake your body line. Shake, shake, shake, Senora! Shake it all the time. Work, work, work, Senora! Work your body line. Work, work, work, Senora! Work it all the time.  You can talk about Cha Cha Tango, Waltz, or the Rumba, Senora's dance has no title You just jump in the saddle Hold on to the bridle!  Jump in the line, rock your body in time! Oh yeah, I believe you! Jump in the line, rock your body in time! Rock your body, child! Jump in the line, rock your body in time! Somebody, help me! Jump in the line, rock your body in time! Whoa!  That right there was the best part about my day playing Wingnuts. To its credit, the game can be incredibly challenging on the hardest setting, and the voices are either funny or cute. Writing this is pointless. If you're still reading this article you're either clearly going to purchase your terrible self another copy of the game and are now just looking for an address to which you can direct your profoundly stupid hate mail, or you're not going to buy it anyway and are now looking for something funny to justify the time spent reading up to this point.1) Send hate mail here.2) I have this story about how I forgot to take screenshots while I was ~playing~ Wingnuts so I had to go back and play it again, even though I couldn't grab images off of the later levels (like it matters), but it's more pitiful than humorous.Shake, shake, shake, Senora!", "date": "Apr 7, 2003"}
