{"name": "NCAA March Madness 2004", "name_review": "March Madness 2004", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/21/march-madness-2004", "text": "For most sports franchises, it seems like developers are happy to throw together an updated roster, maybe tweak a mechanic or two, and if you're lucky, add a new feature. If you're a fan of the March Madness series, though, you're in for a tremendous surprise, as this year's game is so dramatically different, the only thing that remains the same is the name.   A cross between the gameplay of NBA Live 2004 with a feature set that resembles EA Sports' renowned NCAA Football series, March Madness might not be polished or deep enough yet to be the best of both worlds, but it still does enough to be one of the surprise hits of the year.  Gameplay If you thought the frantic pace of the ten-man mo-cap captivated you in Live, just wait until you succumb to the Madness. The college kids play with a fire usually reserved for the Tournament, but hey, in college basketball, any game could be your last, and these ballers go all out, diving on the floor one minute, double teaming or running the break the next.   Each team really plays similar to how they run in real life as well. You'll see the Kentucky crew pressure the ball the entire game from line to line, while the defending champs, the Syracuse Orangemen sit back in their famed 2-3 and stop anyone trying to cut through the lane.  The awesome control scheme introduced in Live is also found in Madness, as the dunk and shoot buttons have been separated, and the Pro Hop (should it be called amateur hop in MM?) lets you skip between defenders on your way to the hole. The only problem I found while utilizing the controls is that the Pro Hop is supposed to also work as a power dribble for the big men inside, but on more than one occasion, when I hit the Pro Hop from the top of the key with my point or shooting guard, he actually went in to the power dribble instead of the two-step travel hop, and nothing is more frustrating than when you think you have control of your player, and then he doesn't do what you had planned. Another downer is the game's framerate, which drops a bit too much for my liking, and is the only thing that really slows down the action.  What has been improved however, is the shooting as well as the ease of tossing alley-oops. These kids can shoot from the outside a bit better than their NBA counterparts, and you are able to make some unbelievable alley-oop plays, sometimes not even near the basket. I tossed one pass high where my shooting guard streaked up from behind, caught it at the free throw line and hit a falling jumper. It might not be the most realistic play on the planet, but is sure was fun.    The attitude and atmosphere of college hoops has also been captured perfectly, as the fight songs, chants, and screaming students really add to the overall experience. And to make you feel like you're really a college athlete, they even include video of real coaches like Ben Braun of Cal instructing you how to beat specific zones and press defenses. My only complaint about the videos is that they're only available before the game (and are almost hidden on a screen most people button through anyway), and don't take place during timeouts, where you might actually need a coach screaming his head off to get you pumped up to go back out on the floor. And while we're at it, if you're going to sign college coaches, how can you not have Bobby Knight, flying chairs and all. Another strange mistake that seems to have been made has been the omissions of the majority of freshmen players around the country. Sure, you can always create them, but if you're buying the game hoping to simulate your favorite team and the top freshmen players they just recruited aren't even in the game, then you're going to be disappointed. You'll also be disappointed if you're a fan of Charleston Southern as the game has them listed in the wrong conference. They might be a small school, but you wouldn't list the Miami Heat in Live's Pacific Division, would you?      If there's one area that March Madness really lags behind the competition, though, it's the game's Dynasty mode. When you start the game, you can adjust your team's schedule to play tougher/weaker opponents, but the logic for whether or not a team accepts seems to make no sense. Playing as Fresno State, Duke and North Carolina accepted games while I was rejected and told to get lost by smaller programs who said I wasn't good enough. Not good enough? Some unranked team is telling me I'm not worth their time when Duke and Carolina accepted bids. Makes no sense. So I started the game over, and the next Dynasty I was rejected by Duke and Carolina while the smaller schools all accepted. What's up with that? Another area that is lacking is the recruiting process. ESPN College Hoops features year-round recruiting where you can visit high school games, invite kids to your games, and you even receive e-mail from players who want to come visit the campus. It just really makes you feel like you're living the Legacy instead of just pushing buttons.   On the plus side, March Madness does feature the Create-A-School mode that everybody loves in NCAA Football, as well as mascot games where you can watch your favorite Stanford tree or UCLA Bruin bear go up for the slam. To top off the list of features, there are rivalry games, tournaments, practice, over 300 teams, and of course, the EA Sports Bio.  Graphics Unlike real college, the players here look a whole lot better than the cheerleaders. I mean, if you're going to have ladies shaking their pop-poms, at least make them something you want to look at. Not that the players are anything great, but they're passable, especially since they are only supposed to be the likenesses of the real college athletes and not the athletes themselves, so EA is able to get away without having all of the tats and faces, unlike NBA Live where you're specifically looking for every detail of your favorite player to be right, from his ink to his kicks.   The ten-man mo-cap really shines in March Madness, along with all of the in-air shot adjustments. From the way players go up for the shot, bring it down, then toss it up from a different angle before they reach the floor always looks smooth, and always makes you want to cheer for the great shot.   Sound The legendary Dickie V. is given a mike, and whether or not you're a fan determines whether or not this is a good thing. Some find him annoying, some find him the best in the business, but the team of Vitale and Brad Nessler do a good job of calling the action, even if you feel like screaming the next time you hear ~That dunk will get you on a poster!~  While the announcing is debatable, there's no debating the fact that the crowd noise is amazing. You hear feet stomping, school specific chants, fight songs, and sneaker squeaks, all adding to the experience making you feel like you're not only watching, but playing a real college basketball game. For the first time maybe ever, there are two very good college basketball games on the market in the same year. This is not only great for the fans, but great for the competition as hopefully both EA Sports and ESPN Games continue to improve their college b-ball titles with the innovations and intentions that go into the rest of their lineups. That being said, while I applaud March Madness' marked improvements, it still doesn't equal ESPN College Hoops in terms of depth, so the game comes in a close second this year on the PS2, and a little more distant on the Xbox due to EA not supporting Xbox Live. One thing's for sure, though. If EA Sports continues to ramp up development on this series, it shouldn't be too long before it is mentioned in the same breath and with the same scores as NCAA Football, and that's something college basketball fans have been asking for since the days of Coach K.", "date": "Nov 21, 2003"}
