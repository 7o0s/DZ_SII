Shades of Bust-A-Move, yes? Well, even if originality it's necessarily the franchise's strong suit, the addictive game play found in the Snood sequel, aptly titled Snood 2, most certainly is.   What matters most in this type of game is control. On the right handset, Snood 2 is quite accurate. On the wrong one, ugh. I have played Snood 2 on both a Sony Ericsson 710a and a Motorola RAZR. The RAZR's iffy controls -- users know that function took a major backseat to form when it came to the face buttons and thumbpad -- really hobbled the game. However, on the Sony, I had no problem lining up great trick shots. So, consider the stickiness (or smoothness) of your handsets controls before downloading Snood 2.   Snood 2 offers significant depth by providing five very playable modes. The most basic is Levels, which presents screen after screen of Snoods that need to be cleared. Puzzles unleashes screens of pre-shaped Snoods already hanging from the ceiling, rather than a basic layered line-up. Journey offers a series of puzzles that increase in difficulty, and thusly, reward. Numbskull's Revenge drops a pair of rotten apples on the board that must be cleared by dropping them into oblivion. The longer they remain on the screen, the more surrounding Snoods are taken over and rendered rotten. Lastly, Armageddon juices the game with a timer.   Snood 2 gooses the whole ~pop bubbles~ formula by replacing basic colored balls wit tiny heads, each with a whimsical or grotesque expression. It adds some personality to the proceedings, and makes Snood 2 a lot more approachable.  I would recommend Snood 2 over EA Mobile's similar  Poppit! if you could care less about the whole Pogo system of earning and managing tokens. It's a great puzzler on a handset with good controls and will provide hours of entertainment, whether those are taken in small five-minute doses, or marathon sessions that Snood 2 is quite capable of inspiring.", "date": "Nov 4, 2005"}
