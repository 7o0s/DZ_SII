When originally released in 1997, the first title fully realised the potential of its host hardware, and likewise Gran Turismo 3 made the PlayStation 2 sing like no other game before it.    It's no surprise then that one of the primary points of interest in Polyphony Digital's primer for next year's full course is the game's visual splendour, and there's no doubting that Gran Turismo has managed the leap to the PlayStation 3 with an assured grace, delivering some of the finest graphics yet witnessed on the machine that would have Michael Schumacher's quite colossal jaw hitting the floor    A menu - but a lovely one, at that.   Running in the promised 1080p, there's a more than generous splash of HDR to remind you which generation you're playing in, and no more is this in effect than in the re-imagining of Gran Turismo stalwart High Speed Ring, a glorious revisit to the fictitious heavily-cambered turns of games past. Emerging from the tunnel towards the end of the course, an outburst of bloom leaves the driver blind to the incoming mild right kink, before the eyesight adjusts just in time for the 180-degree left hander that's best executed with a healthy dose of opposite lock.    That's not to say the graphics are infallible, however. The frame rate is prone to dip on occasion and the sterility that has long haunted the series is still present. Perhaps of chief concern is how disparate the elements that make up the racing world can be  as is now expected of a Gran Turismo title, there's no damage, but more troubling is the lack of any perceivable impact the cars have on their environments; save from kicking up some quite spectacular dust clouds upon leaving the circuit they leave little mark, with no evidence left on track of burnouts or of pushing the tyres to their extremities. It's admittedly a minor gripe, but these omissions taint an otherwise fine looking game, lending to an impression that graphically this game is still a halfway house to what we can expect of a truly current generation Gran Turismo.     Accompanying the visual feast is some truly awesome audio, with each exhaust note of every car rendered perfectly. Get behind the wheel of a Ferrari 360 and the V8 emits a satisfyingly throaty purr. Indeed, from the sound of the wind buffeting the cockpit to the brief respite offered by a slipstream all the way to the tyres screaming to maintain friction, the sound all contributes immeasurably to the total immersion on offer.    That'll be the Proto again. The PROTO.  Of the six tracks included in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, four are debutants to the series and all allow both the unsurpassed handling model and hyper polished graphics engine to bare their glistening teeth. Daytona in its vanilla incarnation manages to be that rarity in racing games  an oval course that actually challenges the player to more than a rudimentary tug on the steering wheel. It's a testament to the depth of the physics in Gran Turismo that hurling one of the cars pulled from the upper end of the performance bracket around the series of banked left handers can prove a genuine thrill, and balancing one of the supercars in a 180mph tank slapper certainly teases the heart up the oesophagus.         Suzuka returns, in both its East and West layouts, and as a staple of modern racing simulations it's as good a place as any for Gran Turismo 5 to distinguish itself from those that would be king  as it does with aplomb. Fuji Speedway, the track which last year ousted Suzuka as the host of the Japanese Grand Prix, is a new addition, and surprisingly one of the strongest circuits of the package. Look beyond the identikit surrounds and over-friendly run off areas that plague the majority of modern Grand Prix circuits and you'll find a series of open turns boasting adverse camber that prove ideal for dipping the rear end out.    London is represented also for the first time in a Gran Turismo game, a short squirt up Shaftesbury Avenue and across Trafalgar Square that again serves to showcase the high end graphical grunt of the engine and is the go-to venue for anyone wanting to see what a next generation Gran Turismo title is capable of visually. Unfortunately the course itself is a fairly uninspired collation of 90-degree turns that tellingly features little in the main structure of the game.    The Nissan GT-R Proto. That's PROTO. It's worth taking note.   Having titillated us in Gran Turismo HD, Eider Nordwand is back, and with its succession of downhill hairpins, it's an ideal setting for the drift mode that again first made its appearance in last year's teaser for this taster. Absent from the Japanese version of Prologue, drift mode rewards players for the length and angle of their sideways follies employing a points system remarkably similar to its real-life counterpart, the D1 Grand Prix.    There's a plethora of options with which to engage with the superior handling dynamic of Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, and sadly for the time being Western gamers are reduced to the lesser of these, the SIXAXIS. It's certainly no major impediment to the experience, but the analogue shoulder buttons of the controller, that seem something of an afterthought, aren't up to the task of delicate throttle or brake control and mapping these controls to the face buttons amputates full interaction with the cars. The Dual Shock 3 slightly improves matters with its tactile feedback but naturally it's only with a steering wheel  the Driving Force Pro or any other supported by the game  that the full experience can be unlocked.    And what an experience it is... There have been many pretenders but when it comes to simulating the out-and-out thrill of pushing a car to its very limits Gran Turismo still emerges top of the pile. Having provided the definitive experience with the fourth instalment, any refinements are subtle but appreciated. It feels more remarkable than ever  no doubt aided by the glossy sheen with which it's all delivered  and benefits from an added layer of weight to the still unsurpassed Gran Turismo formula.    Each track is accompanied by a charming - if bizarre - travel log.  Likewise, the cars have been given an unprecedented makeover, and if previous Gran Turismo's were lauded as car porn the level of fetish afforded to them this time out comes close to the criminal, and the dashboard cam is a superlative addition, with each cars interior represented with freakish care. The Nissan GT-R Proto, Top Gear's Supercar of the year for 2007, features heavily and understandably so, for Polyphony Digital was responsible for designing the multifunction display. The models are now meticulously presented, the pinnacle of which is surely the Ferrari F2007, which powered Kimi Raikkonen to last year's Formula 1 World Championship. It's almost better than the real thing as it seductively rotates in the garage, and looks to be the ultimate goal in the game, costing as it does a prohibitive 2 million credits.      Unfortunately, the grind that's required to unlock the car, and indeed to progress through the game, is one of the major flaws of Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. It's here that the identity crisis the game is clearly having comes to the fore, straddling something between a demo and a full blooded title, as as a result it seems overly restrictive and artificially protracted. Only cars won in the main thrust of the game can be used in the arcade mode, and subsequently this is true for multiplayer as well, so out of the box there's an unnecessary limitation to cars from the lower end of the pecking order. Soon enough there's the opportunity to get hands-on with a car with something a little more substantial under the bonnet, but key to progressing through the 30 events on offer is grinding through the same race multiple times.    Probably the best stitching you'll see in a game this year.   And it's here that the over-prescriptive routines of opposition AI can really frustrate. A bugbear of the Gran Turismo series has always been the somewhat redundant AI of opposition drivers, and while admittedly some baby steps have been made in this area it still falls seriously short of what should be expected of a title of this calibre. It's still a viable tactic to pile into a hairpin full throttle and use the side door of an opposing car as a brake, which in this day and age just feels wrong. Also, when grinding an event, as necessitated by the game's archaic structure, you can't help but feel a serious sense of dj vu overcoming you, as the same Nissan Skyline spins off on the same corner and obstructs the same piece of tarmac. It gifts driver's foresight that would have even Nostradamus choking on his cornflakes, and goes to prove that if it's racing you're after it maybe best to look elsewhere.    Locking out the ability to tune cars until the A Class events have been completed  which requires some 8 or so hours of racing  compounds the fact that the content seems overly stretched. The signposting of requirements in the game is also almost unforgivably sloppy  one event asks of you to set a fastest lap in a Nissan GT-R, and only on throwing away the majority of your credits on one does it become clear in a sub-menu that it's only the Nissan GT-R Proto that's eligible, sending players back to the grindstone. For a game that pores unbelievable amount of detail on even the stitching on the driver's gloves it seems a huge oversight to have such gaping flaws in other elements.    Prepare to lose your lives to grinding away for this beauty.   Moreover, it's a shame as many will want to experience the joys of multiplayer Gran Turismo without having to resort to the grindstone, and it's in the multiplayer that this game looks set to shine. Offline split-screen is a great addition over the earlier Japanese release, and although graphically compromised in small ways such as the omission of the cockpit view, it still proves a thrill. The success of the online component will only become truly apparent over time, and early indications suggest it'll be solid if not a leader in its field, with games prone to lag and frame rate dips. Expect this element to be the subject of further attention from Polyhpony in the future, with updates expected to remedy any current problems, and the suite of options available to be complemented further by imminent updates.   Deeply flawed as the structure of the game may be, theres no doubting it still offers the definitive automotive experience in gaming. As a taster for the full course it suggests that, when it arrives, Gran Turismo 5 could well be one of the greatest driving titles ever. But as a standalone title its impossible to not question Polyphony Digitals decision to drip feed its new game and present what at times can be a ragged package. That said, theres enough content here to keep the petroleum levels in the bloodstream of the most ardent automobile fans peaked, and as such it still manages to nose clear of the rest of the chasing pack.", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
