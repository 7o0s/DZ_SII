Despite the poor reception of last year's Street Fighter port, though, the Japanese publisher decided to proceed with another version of its arcade classic for mobile. However, this time around, the developer did indeed learn from its mistakes, creating a version of Street Fighter II that is superior to its predecessor in more ways than one, but not without a few sacrifices along the way.  The most important change to this version of Street Fighter II is the new control scheme -- it's a noticeable improvement over last years release. Rather than using the shortcut-based control scheme found in the previous version, Capcom has mapped out a d-pad to the phone's number pad. This allows for you to perform all of the signature moves for the various characters fairly accurately. Naturally, without a proper joystick, you can't use the semicircle forward to conjure a fireball, so Capcom has put a simplified control scheme in place that seems to make sense.   Simple commands like pressing forward, down and punch or away, forward and punch are used for the dragon punch or sonic boom. It's a fairly easy and intuitive system, but with everything cramped on the tiny number pad, it comes with a slight learning curve. It's not the ideal solution, as the controls require users to constantly move their hands to shift around for the best access to different buttons, but it works and it's likely the best we're ever going to get until handsets get proper gaming controls.  Right away, you'll note the visuals are strong -- they're translated rather nicely from the source. All of the animations and sprites used in the game are smooth. When Blanca or Vega are hopping around the screen, they're as bright, vibrant and nicely animated as ever and the moves themselves, whether it's Ken's dragon punch, Guile's sonic boom or Ryu's hadokens, are faithfully recreated.   One problem that we found with the visual presentation is that since most phones have a screen in a portrait orientation, the field of vision is relatively narrow. To counter this, the game uses a ~pan and scan~ approach, moving the camera to focus on the action. The backgrounds themselves are simple and clean, but another issue that we noticed is that the animated crowds were noticeably absent. The people themselves are still populating the environments, but the simple animations have been done away with, so all of the spectators are stationary.   The audio of the game is deceptive at first, as when players boot it up, you're greeted with that familiar Street Fighter II tune. It gives us a welcome sense of nostalgia, but that wears off quickly as most of the audio is so-so. It's hardly a disaster, but given its visuals, more was expected from the sound -- it's just part of the SF experience. The themes for each stage are recreated using a polyphonic system, and while some stages are suited for this and make for some great translations, others are definitely not. To add to this, there are no sound effects in the game, so when you expect Guile or Dhalsim to respectively yell ~sonic boom~ or ~yoga fire,~ there will be nothing.Despite its past problems, Street Fighter II now makes a respectable showing on the mobile front. The gameplay is improved with better visuals and smarter controls, and though its missing some sound elements, it still provides some good fun in short bursts. If you were disappointed with last year's take, try this new one.", "date": "Aug 3, 2007"}
