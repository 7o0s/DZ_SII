I have a half-dozen Manga Spawn action figures posed in various threatening positions around my workstation, as do 90% of the people employed in the gaming industry. McFarlane's designs are big and cool and bulky and bloody and goopy, and that certainly makes me a happy camper. And when news came out that Capcom was creating a 4-player NAOMI-based Spawn game, I rejoiced. ~Now I will be able to play with those big and cool and bulky and bloody and goopy characters on my Dreamcast!~ I giggled. And while Spawn: In the Demon's Hand does do a lot of things right, it's brought down by a singular, fatal flaw - sorta like a gorgeous girl who looks like Angelina Jolie,  but starts projectile vomiting when you least expect it.  Capcom cites Spawn as the ultimate Deathmatch game, where up to four players can take control of their favorite McFarlane characters and blast the spit out of each other. The game is a hybrid third-person/first-person shooter, and the player can run, jump, shoot, and execute special attacks through particularly evil-looking Quake-style arenas.  Spawn is essentially a variation on a single multiplayer theme. The real meat of the single-player arcade game is Boss Attack mode, where you pound through a stream of random boss characters alone or with a friend. For example, in the first stage, your goal is to ~DESTROY THE MAFIA,~ and put a bloody end to the white-coated boss who pops up after a few seconds of gameplay. In Spikeout style, you pound on bad guys until the Boss shows up, then concentrate on kicking his fool ass until he's dead. If you're killed, you get the gameplay equivalent to a slap on the wrist - you simply respawn in another location. The only thing you have to worry about is the clock, since the Boss Attack mode is over after a user-definable amount of time.   As far as multiplayer modes, the game is a bit bare in comparison to a game like Perfect Dark. Battle Royal Mode is a free-for-all Deathmatch romp, where up to four players can go at it via a split-screen mode; Team Battle lets you go two-on-two for cooperative action. Due to wussie polygon budget constraints, there are a few limitations on where you can kill each other - the super-detailed environments of Boss Attack mode aren't available in four-player split-screen, and you'll need to make do with barren ~Labyrinth~ zones that must use a total of, say, three textures. The only new addition to the Dreamcast version is Tournament Mode, which offers a single-player Team Battle or Battle Royal. In this mode, you climb up a tournament ladder, gaining points for every kill you make. There is no multiplayer support in this mode.   Most of the arenas have more than one ~room~ - the environments branch off into secret areas, like adjoining caves and warehouses. As expected, there are crates and boxes-a-plenty, which may be broken to obtain glowing orbs that grant you weapon and speed powerups. You can also find crypts lying around, which hold powerful weapons inside. And don't forget to use each level's layouts to your advantage - characters can be knocked off cliffs into pits of lava, which is infinitely entertaining.   If your character possesses a range weapon, he or she will automatically target anyone within line of sight - a green laser site pops out and indicates who (or what) you're aiming at. In a similar fashion, if someone's aiming at you, you start flashing red, and huge honkin' crosshairs appears over the part of you that's being targeted. Another visual aid is the radar at the bottom of the screen, which offers a cute touch by resembling Spawn's head. And while there is a first-person perspective mode (hold down the ~center camera~ button for it), your lack of mobility makes it a risky endeavor.   Sounds pretty good, don't it?  Spawn would actually be a pretty tight game if it weren't for the atrocious camera system. This camera is jumpier than a paranoid schizophrenic in a cage full of rabid pit bulls, and does a good job of keeping your enemies out of frame so you can't seem them attacking. While fighting with the larger bosses, the camera starts clipping and spinning around the environment, and even into the bosses themselves. Sometimes the camera is high. Sometimes it's low. Sometimes it's stuck in a big clump of rocks or in the middle of a building. This is not my idea of fun - and I'm shocked that Capcom let something as unpolished as this slip through. Oh, sure, you can change the camera's distance in the options screen, but it still jumps into stupid-ass angles that reduce the game to an unplayable mess.   I also believe that the Boss Mode's ~Time Attack~ system was utilized so the designers wouldn't have to balance the bosses, who are, quite frankly, cheap as hell. A well-designed boss can be beaten without suffering any damage, but the monstrosities in Spawn will kick your ass like Jet Li versus Gary Coleman, hitting you from behind, in mid-air, or any time they damn well feel like it. Things are made even uglier by the complete and total lack of analog control.   Ah well, at least some influences from Power Stone 2 managed to squeeze their way into the game. There are dozens upon dozens of items and weapons, which can be unlocked by repeatedly beating the game and visiting your local Japanese arcade with an extra VMU. (I can't wait to wield the ~Steel Bikini.~) There is also an ungodly number of selectable characters -- thirty-six, to be exact. Almost every character you meet in the game can be playable, though you'll need to devote a few hours of gameplay to unlocking the entire horde. There's also a Gallery mode that shows off various illustrations and sketches.   As with the majority of Japanese Capcom releases, Spawn features the option for on-line network battles. American gamers aren't missing out on much here, since the KDD-run servers are under-populated, laggy, and cost a whopping 10 cents for every three minutes of gameplay. And since Spawn's multiplayer code is not Internet-based, I wouldn't expect to be playing this one over Sega.Net when it hits the States.   And did I mention that the game looks amazing? The character modeling is simply awesome, capturing the exaggerated look of McFarlane's designs, and the backgrounds are loaded up with high-res textures and massive detail. Heads, limbs, and entire torsos are cleaved off with killing blows (be sure to set the game's violence level to the max), and the blood gushes in a ridiculously over-the-top fashion. And just wait until you see the final boss, who's sure to instill fear into the hearts of all gamers. Cool stuff indeed.  Best of all, the game is locked at 60fps, except in the four-player split-screen mode - things can bog down here when all four characters are tussling at once (if you do the math, that's sixteen high-polygon characters on screen at once). The voice acting is good (but repetitive), and the music is your expected Capcom evil-rock.   But pretty graphics can't make up for a seizure-inducing camera. I'll be honest with you - I wanted to love this game, and I kept going back to it to see if I could overcome the crap-a-licious cameras and the lack of analog control, and actually have fun. I could not do it. If you're a hard-core Spawn or McFarlane fan, import away - you'll probably love it. As for everyone else - go to Toys R Us and spend your $60 on Manga Spawn action figures instead. I wish I did.  -- Colin ~Butt-Cam~ Williamson, IGNDC While I agree with Colin that this camera was, much like the main character, ~spawned~ in the pits of Hell, I am afraid I am going to have to disagree with the big CW's final prognosis.  The game itself is actually a lot of fun.  The gameplay reminds me of old-school Streets of Rage meets Quake, and that just isn't that bad.Granted, the camera needs work, and the fact that you can't use the analog stick is a bit stupid, but overall, the game is a lot of fun once you get past its problems and figure out how to play.  The character design is awesome, and the levels are also pretty cool.  Not a great game, but hardly the second coming of Mr. Driller.  With a few fixes, this could be awesome.The Verdict: Wait for the U.S. Version", "date": "Aug 16, 2000"}
