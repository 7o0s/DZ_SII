But I'm not talking about Orrin Hatch's dedicated remix of ~Cleaning Out My Closet~ to Trent Lott. I'm not talking about how ugly things get in malls during this time of year. I'm not even talking about Michael Jackson's latest publicity stunt. Instead, I'm referring to the end of the world. Yeah, that's right, the Rapture, Ragnarok, the Apocalypse, or whatever you want to call it. I know, I can hear the comments now: I'm crazy, I'm extreme, I'm a modern day Nostradamus. Well, just you wait, because something is coming, and it's going to make the Y2K bug look like a speck of dust. Don't believe me? Just ask Denyasha, a small Japanese developer who's been living out the horror of the post-Apocalypse world. Actually, they've been living with the Judgment Day themed game for a year now in the Land of the Rising Sun. In the vein of Diablo and other action-RPGs, the first episode of Shadowflare is now poised to expand the chaos to Western shores.  Most people are now accustomed to the typical medieval setting for RPGs, featuring a bevy of mythical monsters, powerful magic and brave heroes wielding mighty weapons. Shadowflare attempts to place a spin on this clich?d formula by advancing the time period of the game into the near future, one that's quickly disrupted by a cataclysmic event. No, it's not Cher's latest skin baring outfit. Society and life around the world as we currently know it was completely disrupted by a rift that suddenly appeared. Named the Black Abyss because of the numerous monsters that issued from its depths, the destruction wrought by these creatures was immense. While not expressly stated, it seems as though even the world's mightiest armies couldn't withstand the onslaught of beings, which lead to the wide scale slaughter of millions of people. Eventually, the last remaining survivors of the attacks huddled together, founding small towns and praying for an end to the evil ravaging the land. However, a new hope for the survivors has slowly emerged, people brave enough to take on these malicious fiends with steel or newly discovered magic, seeking an end to the destruction of the world.  You're given the choice at the beginning of a new game of choosing either a male of female character, which has no effect upon your stats, inventory or other aspects of play. Regardless of your choice, you start the game out as a mercenary for hire who roams the wilderness taking out creatures. However, you can later switch your character's job to one of three different classes. Warriors are the first class, which are typically good at hand-to-hand combat and physical activity. Wizards (or Witches if you choose a female character) are better at using magic or magical items. Finally, Hunters excel at long range attacks, preferring to take enemies out at a distance. You're initially tasked with a difficult mission, the discovery and assassination of a gargoyle that's killed everyone it's fought. Yet, like most RPG's, you'll receive tasks to accomplish from townsfolk. These can be mundane, such as the retrieval of stolen or missing items, or difficult, such as the elimination of a threat to a town.   Unlike many other RPG's, your character doesn't just venture into battle alone. Instead, players start the game off with an animal companion who can perform many of the duties of a henchman or teammate in other games. For example, you can have your companion retrieve items that have been dropped by enemies or activate switches to open doors. Their most frequent use, however, is in battles, where they can be used as supplemental attackers. Every animal has two separate modes. In inactive state, it will merely follow you around, receiving immunity to attacks. During this state, your companion also heals any damage it's taken in battle. If you're ready for a little assistance in a fight, you can switch it over to active status. Without needing direction, your animal will attack the closest threat to your character until it dies or until every threat around you is eliminated. Just like your characters, your animal companion can also gain levels and stronger attacks. Yet you're never forced to continually use the same animal. In fact, in every town there are new animals awaiting your guidance, and you can switch between attendants at will.  You'll sometimes want to do this to take full advantage of both your companion and your character's attributes. Everything within Shadowflare displays a certain affinity towards one of 8 elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Thunder, Holy, Dark, Gel or Metal. Relating from specific character stats, such as attack and defense strength, magical evasion, and magical power, this system establishes a cyclical balance of natural resistance and weakness. Think of it as a complex system of rock, paper, scissors. For example, a monster with a strong Thunder level does more damage against an Earth character and vice versa. If, on the other hand, a character and monster have a similar attraction to a certain element, the one with the stronger level will hold the greater advantage. Although you'll grow stronger as you move up in levels, you'll obviously want to augment your character's stats through equipment or magical needs to be ready for any potential monster you'll come across. However, as most vets of RPG's know, trying to equip yourself for every possibility will turn your characters into a pack mule instead of a hero. Fortunately, every character receives a magical portal to warehouses in every town where they can place, exchange and store additional items. I can here the comments already though. ~What good will that do me if I'm stuck out in the wastelands without a town nearby?~ Well, teleportation shrines are scattered liberally throughout the outdoors, allowing you instant travel back and forth from places that you've previously explored. If you happen to be crawling through a tower or a dungeon, you'll have to cast your transport spell to open a portal back to town.       Tactical use of these portals or spells can be the difference between survival and death on the battlefield. Shadowflare's main combat system is just like Diablo's in that you click on an enemy and your character attacks the chosen target once. This extends to casting offensive magic spells as well. So, inflicting mortal wounds often involves clicking your mouse button with enough fervor to get your strikes in faster that you receive them. Although you have some amount of time to pick off foes with distance weapons if you choose to wield them, you may find that you're often swarmed by three or more foes. Unlike most titles, Shadowflare gives you the ability to customize two attack inventories, so you can switch between ranged and hand to hand combat with the touch of a button. If you do wind up getting overwhelmed and need to retreat to a safer area, you can drop a few armed landmines behind you that will inflict damage on any non-friendly units once they exploded. As you continue to slay enemies and gain experience, you'll also build up an invisible power meter that will allow you to move faster and inflict more damage with your weapons and spells when filled. Inevitably, however, you will deplete your health and magic meters in battle. At this point, you'll either have to swallow health tablets or magic capsules, or make a break for a portal so you can teleport to town and get healing from the resident witch.   Unfortunately, there are facets of gameplay that either make no sense or don't work as well as the designers probably intended them to. First off, while the game attempts to make a big deal about the numerous creatures that issued forth from the gaping maw of the Black Abyss. However, there is a very limited set of creatures that you'll go against in Episode 1. In fact, a majority of the time, you'll go up against what seems to be one of two kinds of creature in differing numbers. Aside from flying bats, you'll have run-ins with goblins waving swords or distance weapons. Any other enemies are simple variations on these themes, such as goblins with armor. Shadowflare does try to break up this monotony by including bosses within the game. Oftentimes, these characters are the cause for some crisis, such as a stolen artifact or rampage through the countryside. However, once you've gone in search for these roguish characters, you'll find yourself running up against frightening and deadly characters such as the malevolent....Red Goblin. What the hell? Red Goblin? I know first graders that can come up with scarier names than that. Well, bad names aside, these bosses are only a bit tougher than the average monster, so you shouldn't be too concerned about fighting them. A majority of the time, your companion can distract or inflict enough damage for you to strike the finishing blow.  Maybe I should say that this tactic is effective for the first few levels. The animal henchman starts out at a higher level than your character at the beginning of the game, and can truly save you in some of the earlier scrapes. However, it winds up gaining levels much slower that your character does, regardless of the number of monsters you kill. What inevitably happens is that your character will wind up outdistancing the animal in terms of attack strength, defensive capability, and battle tactics. This unfortunately reduces your animal friend to a decoy in battles in the best circumstances. At worst, it becomes a simple a pet that you can never fully get rid of. Even if it's slaughtered during gameplay, you'll inevitably receive another one during a save or a reload, so if you wanted to adventure on alone, you'll never actually get the chance. The save and load situation is another sticking point, primarily because of its amount of redundancy. Instead of titles like Diablo, which allowed you to save a character and start a new game at your discretion, Shadowflare automatically treats any loaded game as if it's brand new. This means that you'll continually have to scratch and claw your way through fields, forests and dungeons that you've already cleared if you ever save and quit the game. Doesn't seem to make much sense to force players through the same gauntlet of enemies they've already defeated if they take simple breaks for the real world, such as sleep or work.  There also seem to be a few discrepancies as far as gameplay is concerned. While this is essentially based in a modern context, there are items that contradict the medieval gameplay you'll experience. For example, while you'll heal yourself with tablets and capsules, and use landmines as guerilla warfare in battles, you're limited to body armor, shields and swords. No guns, flamethrowers, grenades or other modern weaponry is available to be used against these numerous monsters. While I can only assume that a majority of these arms are ineffective against these creatures, it does raise eyebrows once you've laid a strategic line of mines down in a dungeon only to dash forward into a room with a sword. This incredulity is only furthered with the discovery of automated laser turrets, bolt guns, or teleportation generators for enemies.   Just as confusing is the career system. While there is an implication within the game and the instructions as to how you'll be able to change careers, the game rarely gives you the option to do so. Instead, you'll seemingly stumble into a new profession based solely off your gameplay. For example, I remained a mercenary until fifth or sixth level, which was when I suddenly became a warrior without speaking to anyone, training at a school or gaining any further skills. Since I'd been using my sword more than magic or distance weapons, this did seem to be a natural progression, but since I was thinking of trying to create a wizard, it was a little disconcerting. Acquiring spells doesn't seem to be intuitive at all, primarily because you're merely given spells without any personal input or decision as to what you want. It also doesn't provide any information as to how you'll be able to strengthen the level of offensive or defensive magic, so customizing your mages doesn't really seem to be an option. That's a pretty frustrating feature, but what's even more annoying is the fact that changing careers doesn't seem to have an overt change on gameplay. You'll still click your mouse buttons as fast as you can on enemies in an attempt to kill them, and you'll still receive the same missions regardless of whether or not you're a Hunter, Wizard or Warrior.      Finally, the network option for the game, a feature that is heavily touted by the designers, is rather flawed in execution. In theory, the game allows up to four players to get together and travel throughout the single player campaign as a team, boosting their character's stats or clearing missions. If you can get a game started, it does provide a decent team experience, allowing you to communicate with fellow adventurers and gain experience for your characters that can then be used in the single player version. However, the network option has a lot of flaws. In the included state of the game, there's no server client or browsable feature available, forcing players that want to adventure through the game to know each others specific IP Addresses to establish a connection. While this is fine if you're with friends, it defeats the purpose of creating a community with other players you don't know. Community issues aside, you'll need to make sure that every player within the game has the exact same version of the game, down to the specific code release. Many times, you'll discover that games will be bounced or rejected because one player is attempting to host a game with an outdated version. However, even players with similar code releases can have problems because the game will not always recognize the version code. To help remedy the myriad of problems, a standalone server client was released to help players browse the Denyusha networks to find other players, but this is flawed as well, primarily because the servers for the network seems to go up and down at random times, terminating games in the middle of missions.  Graphically, you're not going to be pushing the bounds of your computer with Shadowflare. At first glance, you might not be too terribly impressed with the game. The sprites appear to be outdated 2D models within the basic isometric perspective that you'd expect from any old Genesis game cartridge. You'll also notice that a lot of the textures within the game seem to be ripped from the same color palette, with tons of green and brown patches to represent grass and dirt respectively. There are moments when this bland texturing can be a bit of a problem, such as detecting items that have been dropped from dead opponents and background textures. This is especially highlighted in dungeon sequences, where the transparency of walls and the low light levels can make it hard to detect switches, items, or doorways. Additionally, if you walk into The Hanged Forest or the Dusty Wasteland, wouldn't you expect the setting to reflect the name? Unfortunately you won't receive that here.  However, it does feature some nice animations. For example, steam issuing out of the numerous valves scattered throughout the world is rather well done, with a nice attention to individual particles. Both your health and magic bars bubble and fizz, which as a very cool touch to the typical meters found in action games. Another cool feature is being able to detect exactly what piece of equipment your character is using at a glance. If you remove your boots, for example, you'll notice the change in foot ware. This can also be exaggerated by assigning specific colors to your items so they stand out. Blue swords, red suits of armor, or other color combos are all options available to you. Characters also have a good range of motion, such as when they're swinging a weapon, casting a spell or across the screen. Spells in particular look rather nice, ranging from the crackle of an energy bolt flying towards an opponent to the geometrical patterning of a transportation spell. Combat will typically result in a large number of bodies sprawled on the ground, with a decent amount of blood spraying from fallen opponents, along with reinforcements charging into the fray.  What did you think of Shadowflare?  The sound is probably the weakest feature of the whole game. There is no voice over work within the game itself, which could've helped the title out with a certain amount of atmosphere. Musically, Shadowflare reaches into the depths of the MIDI world to pull out a few tunes. Obviously influenced with an anime style soundtrack, the jaunty tunes feature flutes and synthetic instruments. While the tunes are decent and do a fair job of providing atmosphere, they're only attached to certain areas. For example, there's the town theme that plays no matter what town your in, the dungeon theme that plays when you're underground, and the outdoor area that plays when you traverse the wilderness. Very few exceptions to these three themes can be found, which inevitably results in you tuning them out because of the lack of variety. Shadowflare does provide decent sound effects for weapons used in battle. For example, the sound of a sword clanging off armor sounds different than the thud of a sling bullet, and the definite crackle of spell energy can roar through an area. Landmines also have a definite timer countdown, with a steadily increasing beep before a large-scale explosion goes off. There are also some cool additions, such as the hiss of steam as it escapes from valves or the high pitched howl of your canine companion as it looks for something to attack.There's something to be said about the concept and the plot of Shadowflare. For 14.99, you can download a constantly changing title that has many elements of previous Action-RPGs. With a lot of room to grow and expand as a series, and a storyline that doesn't really rehash previously thought of ideas, Shadowflare shows a ton of promise as a game that can challenge the concept of these action titles.However, Episode 1 shows that the developers have plenty of areas of improvement they might want to work on for future releases. Minimal variations in enemies, musical tracks, or backgrounds suggests that the first episode was not so much an indication of what the series can be, but rather a work in progress. Plus, some of the features, such as the career paths and companions, seem like they still need to be flushed out more, with additional control given to the player for personal customization and decisions for their characters. Episode 2 just recently came out, and Episode 3 of the series should be arriving shortly after the New Year. By early accounts, Episode 2 is much harder and impressive than the first title, which suggests that players willing to stick by this title may just find a sleeper hit on their hands.", "date": "Dec 17, 2002"}
