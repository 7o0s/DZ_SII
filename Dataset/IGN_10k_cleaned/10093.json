The red-headed, no-nonsense secret agent girlfriend of Ryu Hayabusa, Irene Lew played a significant supporting role in the first two Ninja Gaiden games on the NES -- and she opens the third with her untimely demise. Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom finds Ryu coming to terms with the unexpected loss, but also sets him out on a quest to clear his name; because he has been falsely accused of Irene's murder.   Ninja Gaiden III was the third and final installment in Tecmo's side-scrolling action series in the 8-bit era, and it offers up the same core gameplay as its two predecessors. You play as Ryu, a reflexive, light-on-his-feet ninja warrior armed with a sword, and you're tasked to clear a series of stages by slashing and dodging your way through seemingly endless amounts of annoying enemies, followed by the occasional big boss. You can supplement your strength with additional power-up items and alternative weapons, too, and you have the added mobility bonus of being able to scale sheer walls. Because ninja are cool like that.   The environments in Ninja Gaiden III are more densely detailed than ever before. Where Ninja Gaiden III sets itself apart from Ryu's previous outings is in those areas of powering up and being mobile, as each has been remixed here. The most notable change is that Ninja Gaiden II's signature feature, the ~spirit clones~ have been cut from this sequel. You can no longer split Ryu's body into three. Instead, new power-ups include the Sword Extender, which gives Ryu's Dragon Sword added length and power, and the Vacuum Wave Art, which projects energy waves vertically above and below Ryu and is especially useful for when you're climbing up walls.   And, after climbing up walls, you'll find that Ninja Gaiden III makes completing your ascent easier -- you just press the D-Pad in the direction of solid ground at the top of a structure and press A to make Ryu flip up onto it, which is much nicer than the awkward method employed in the last game. And Ryu can now also go hand-over-hand to climb on the undersides of some ceilings and platforms, an all-new ability made just for this edition.   So all of that is well and good, right? Right. Unfortunately, Ninja Gaiden III goes a little south from there. After establishing a promising storyline set up by an unexpected death, after focusing the gameplay and adding new features and after refocusing Ryu's abilities by eliminating the spirit clones, you'd expect that this sequel is set up well to exceed its predecessors and solidify itself as the best installment of the series. But it doesn't. Because it's still too stinking hard.   Ninja Gaiden III is ridiculously difficult. And not the fun, rewarding kind of difficult that makes you want to try harder. It's the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to throw your controller at the TV screen and just go read a book. Ninja Gaiden is a series that's always been known for its challenge, and that continues to be one of the franchise's signature traits to this day. But the way that Ninja Gaiden III achieves its difficulty factor is uninspired -- standard, basic enemies take off huge chunks of Ryu's health, there aren't as many continues to use here as in past Ninja Gaiden games, and the level design is consistently odd and hard to navigate, even with the added mobility abilities made in this revision.   Additionally, the game defeats a lot of its early strong points by the choices it makes as the adventure progresses; the storyline that begins so compellingly ends up getting watered down by weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones, and upgrades like the Sword Extender power-up are counter-balanced by downgrades that afflict you if you haven't collected the right orb. Ryu's standard sword length is shorter here than it was in Ninja Gaiden I or II, making the Sword Extender less of a cool bonus and more of a necessity, annoying when you don't have it or when you lose it after an accidental death.The final verdict is that Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is still a solid and impressive action game from the NES era, but it's also a game that missed out on capitalizing on its early potential. As a result, this game that could have been the best of the original Ninja Gaiden trilogy ends up placing third out of three. The original Ninja Gaiden is still your best bet, and after that, Ninja Gaiden II is second. Only invest the additional dollars for Ninja Gaiden III after you're experienced at least one of its predecessors first, and if you're comfortable with subjecting yourself to another full game's worth of frustration and ridiculous challenge. Irene may be dead, but after trying to find out who did it through a handful of these stages, you might just stop caring and turn the power off.", "date": "Feb 28, 2008"}
