Countless companies have made countless efforts to cash in the massive success of the ~tycoon~ name, lent to not only some of the best pc games made, but also some of the poorest. Roller Coaster Tycoon is probably one of the most widely recognized names in the PC market, so perhaps dubbing a game ~tycoon~ would attract some of the biggest suckers out there? My apologies, did I say suckers? Well that's what you would be had you given this game a run through, for not only does it not improve on the horrid shortcomings of its predecessor, but laboring through every moment of the game causes immense long-term psychological effects. Welcome to Airport Tycoon 2.    The aforementioned words may initially sound harsh, but they are entirely appropriate when it comes to a game that lacks everything that a game should be: fun and entertaining, with some lasting appeal to keep you coming back for more. Yet Airport Tycoon 2 never draws the gamer into its world. It never lets the player become immersed in a new reality. A complete lack of depth keeps anyone out of reaching distance for a possible good time. The entire game revolves around securing contracts with other airlines who would wish to use your airport for their evil bidding. Well, the only thing truly evil is all the paperwork that the game entails. Because that's what it is: paperwork. A lot of the game consists of navigating boring screens managing finances and lots of other not-so-fun things.   The game puts you in charge of constructing the greatest airport in the world in one of 25 locales from Athens to Sydney. You can choose another route when entails one of six predetermined scenarios for the undertaking. Starting from scratch is not only tedious, but outright frustrating. In order for anything to happen you must first navigate the poorly designed menus in order to locate the lifeblood of your airport: a terminal, runway, and parking garage. Nothing in the tutorial apprises you of this necessity. The game's tutorial almost entirely fails to tutor. Its instructions are ambiguous at best leaving the player scratching his head still wondering how to perform many of the game's actions. In order to find out that the game will go absolutely nowhere unless these structures are built you will have to scour the manual to find this minor detail.   Once these three structures have been erected airlines will begin offering you contracts for planes to begin frequenting your establishment. But it almost seems like a fluke when you finally manage to grapple the many variables necessary for anything at all to happen. There is no announcement, no declaration, no help whatsoever within the game to make you aware of your progress, or more often than not, the lack thereof.    Glitches and inconsistencies abound in this game, ladies and gentlemen, ranging from minor to downright obstructive. Menu labels will not appear unless an item is deselected. On the other end of the spectrum, navigating the camera requires a crew of eight men enrolled at the Michigan Institute for Technology. Attempting to rotate the camera will only result in an overload of frustration as this game probably implements the worst 3D interface this reviewer has ever witnessed. You cannot simply slide the mouse to move the camera, you must click and drag, which is magnificently outrageous considering you cannot move the camera while you have an item selected. Zooming in and out is simple with the scroll button, but it is jerky and ineffective due to the manner in which the buildings are constructed and placed. Often buildings will obstruct others from view, mainly roads, harboring any attempt to gain a general overview of your airport at any given time.    The options in the game are downright laughable. In a game that promises the ability to micromanage to your heart's content, it offers on some levels, and denies on others. You can place buildings and roads as much as you like, but when it comes down to the actual management of the airport and its commuter traffic, the game fails to deliver. You never actually witness travelers hustling through the airport. Details such as people going through the airport, security, and restrooms are merely represented in 2 dimensional forms on screens that are accessible only through tiresome navigation of sub-screens.    It's funny to note how many delays there are within a game that deals with airport simulation. The game boots up quite quickly but loading a new scenario can take upwards of several minutes even on a fairly powerful 1.3 GHz computer. Even within the game there are moments between when you click on a building and when it's actually placed on the map. Perhaps the developers were attempting to postpone the inevitable pain that a player might feel when he witnesses the grotesqueness of every individual blurry texture.     The graphical options in the game are severely relegated to simply changing the resolution, with the maximum possible being 1024x768. For a game that requires a 600 MHz processor and a 32 Meg graphics card, one would expect a whole lot more than what is presented here. The buildings are poorly constructed, blurry, and blocky. The colors are dull, and it is probably a blessing that it isn't possible rotate the buildings because they probably wouldn't look a whole lot better on the other side.   Intermittent shadows are cast upon the airport by passing airplanes, with practically no special lighting effects to speak of. If you're feeling adventuresome and need an even bigger challenge of playing the game you might like to take advantage of the option of making it night time. The only noticeable effect this has on your boring airport is making it even harder to see things and ~play~ the game.    The sound department adds yet more detriment to an already ailing game. Each of the 25 cities boast a 30 second loop of poorly synthesized midi-sounding clanging noise that would drive anyone to the brink of insanity. Each track attempts to capture the cultural feeling of the area of the world each denotes, yet each 30 second sample is so poorly composed any desired effect is entirely lost. The easiest way to tolerate the music is to move the slider all the way down, making all music non-existent. Done.   As far actual sound within the game, well...what sound? Other than the occasional braking sound from landing planes or the beeps and squawks that emit from the placement of a new building, there is practically nothing to hear in the game. Now that you've turned off the music, and due to the fact that that there is no ambience, the entire game feels very stale and lifeless from an aural standpoint. What did you think of Airport Tycoon 2?    It's hard to comprehend why a publisher would wish to release a sequel to a game that was just as bad as its eventual successor. There really is no reward offered to the player for playing the game. There is no sense of satisfaction. The game fails to deliver in every aspect a good game should: good graphics, fun and immersive gameplay, and appeal that is somewhat lasting. Airport Tycoon 2 offers nothing new to the genre, and if anything detracts from it, giving gamers even less faith in the originality of developers and the implementation of new ideas.  Games are supposed to be fun. This game simply is not. The lack of a multiplayer mode is probably a blessing in disguise, yet ultimately detracts from the game even more giving it very little variety and uniqueness. There are so many better options available in the ~tycoon~ genre, and this latest incarnation is an abomination to all that is holy and sacred. Stay far, far away.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
