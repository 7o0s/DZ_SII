How I love this revolution you have instigated -- now lead your fanbase onwards, farther and farther out into the wild yonder, blithengly chanting ~E-C-Dub~ out of your minds, and please never look back. Me, I'll be sitting back here with this bewildered and aggravated look on my face, simply asking myself, ~They seriously expected me to shovel this sh...~Developed by Crawfish in the span of about a lunch break and a cup of decaf, Acclaim's newest poop offering is ECW Hardcore Revolution. Although the game seems based on the similarly anemic WWF Attitude game, they are entirely different games. For instance, in WWF Attitude, you press B to grab a guy, and in ECW Hardcore you press A. That's the only instance, actually. Other than that, they are the same game.FeaturesWrestlers.Wrestling.Barbed wire.An absence of a link option so as not to insult people who have no friends to play with.Fun with a capital F-, and Suck without that capital S.Only for Game Boy ColorFor the rest of us, ECW Hardcore will be thirty bucks well saved for lap dances and cheetos, as only a boob would buy this game after playing the second-rate WWF Attitude game. But even for fans of the ECW league who buy this knowingly or not, the game will be a crushing disappointment. So, for those unfamiliar with Acclaim's Attitude problem, let's treat ECW as a wholly different pile of maerd. Ten wrestlers face off against each other (in a ring way too huge to be realistic, just like Attitude) in one of the game's four modes (which is two modes less than Attitude -- Tag Team and King of the Ring Tournament play are idiotically missing in ECW). After training your big thugs in the Training session and learning all the moves (the vast majority of which were seen before in Attitude), take them out in the challenge mode against the game's dirty dozen minus two superstars (which is half that of WWF Attitude, and might I add that many would consider it a stretch to call these neckoids ~superstars,~ but that's not for me to judge).You can even take them into an arena covered with barbed wire! (Which, sadly, plays exactly like the cage match in WWF Attitude in that you throw your opponent into it and he falls down -- other than that, and the fact that the cage is fun because you're trying to get out, the play is the same.)Crawfish is a great developer on the Game Boy Color, but when push comes to shove (as often does with an Acclaim project), they have no troubles with rushing a game through development, skipping features and casting away good game play, in favor of meeting the deadline. This game has the Big Red X marked all over it -- besides fewer wrestlers (and might I add that there are NO female wrestlers in the game), there isn't a FMV introduction like in Attitude, and the game's F'n ugly text menues and lanky interface show how uninterested Crawfish was with this game. The game play is still stupid -- trying to use a move which requires pressing backwards on the controller often turns your wrestler the wrong direction and sets him up for an atomic drop, and a wrestler can jump off the top rope and squarely nail somebody in the opposite corner! The graphics are just as flickery and framey, and the wrestlers look even less like their real-life counterparts. In fact, sometimes I would choose for myself a blonde-haired bronze man-god as my character, and grotesque ogre for an opponent (you know, to reenact my epic battles against IGNpocket's Craig over the Pokmon of the Day feature), and about halfway into the match I'd be asking myself, ~Now, am I the beardy-head fat guy with the dumpy butt or the other beardy-head fat guy with the dumpy butt?~No link cable play, ten wrestlers, Game Boy Color only, very few moves, no ECW-specific features, no extreme behavoir or cursing (besides me at the game), lame barbed wire play, butt-ugly graphics, sad sound, an old game engine, half of the features and characters of the WWF game, boring game play, jackaled moves and daft play control,  stinky quality... ECW fans, you know you want it!", "date": "Mar 8, 2000"}
