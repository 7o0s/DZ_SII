A possible American release for the title has yet to be announced.    Puzzle games are almost always hit-or-miss. While there's nothing I enjoy more than sitting down with Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, a worthy opponent, and a bottle of Yoo-Hoo, I'd sooner chew dead rats than play something like, say, Zoop. A puzzle game's got the ~hook,~ or it doesn't ? simple as that.  With that in mind, I was a little nervous upon picking up my copy of Chu Chu Rocket, Sonic Team's first puzzle game. At the Tokyo Game Show, the game looked like a chaotic excursion into total confusion, and we couldn't make heads or tails of it from the gameplay footage we witnessed. However, once we got to sit down with this little beastie and learn the ropes, we uncovered one of the most furiously addicting multiplayer games since Mario Kart. You're gonna love this one.  The rules are simple, so listen up: Chu Chu Rocket takes place on a checkered playfield. There are two characters you'll manipulate: the mice (Chu-Chus) and the cats (Nekos). Both Chu-Chus and Nekos pop out of spawn points, placed at various places across the board. The Nekos are slow, lumbering orange blobs with gaping maws, and will kill any Chu-Chu that they touch.  Now, both of the species aren't too bright, and follow a set movement pattern: they travel in a straight line until they hit a wall, then they take a ninety-degree turn to their right. However, you have the ability to drop arrows onto the playfield, which will redirect any Chu-Chu or Neko in a new direction. Only three arrows can be dropped simultaneously, and they flicker and fade out after about ten seconds.  Your goal is to herd as many Chu-Chus as possible into your rocket, which will fly them to safety at the end of a round. This isn't a cut-and-dry affair, as the Nekos will usually follow the paths of your Chu-Chus into the rocket, causing a massive explosion and the death of many, many innocent Chu-Chus. The best thing to do is to lead the Neko away from your rocket, and into your opponent's ? which will be sure to cause a good deal of aggression from your best friends. You can also lead both groups of critters into bottomless pits, which will drop them out of sight and out of mind.  Put the game into motion, and it's golden. There's never any lack of Chu-Chus ? the little guys spew from the spawning points en masse, and you can see anywhere from a dozen to several hundred Chu-Chus running around the screen at once. The outrageous number of Chu-Chus makes it easy to identify the ~flow~ of mice, so you can start dropping arrows to get 'em under control. One to four players can go at it simultaneously, and if you like, the CPU can play as well. It's also worth mentioning that unlike the hideously unbalanced Mario Party, the computer does play fair ? and is a little dumb, even on the hardest levels.  Chu-Chu herding and Neko evasion are fun enough as it is... but Sonic Team has opted to throw in special, colored Chu-Chus to spice things up. When these little fellows are herded into a rocket, one of several interesting, timed events can occur: Chu-Chu Fever: The flow of Chu-Chus is exponentially increased, and a steady stream of them bursts forth from all of the Chu-Chu spawn points. If you act fast and get your arrows in the right position, you can score big-time. Chu-Chu Bonus: An obscene number of Chu-Chus is sucked into one lucky player's rocket. Neko Fever: Cats start popping out of the spawn points, ready to plow into anyone in their path. Watch out, or your score's gonna drop like a rock. Neko Present: Three players get a cat teleported into their rockets, while one lucky player sits back and laughs Timeout: The action stops, giving you a breather to assess the situation. Everybody Switch!: The positions of all four player rockets switch Slow Down: The game runs at half-speed Speed Up: The game runs twice as fast.  You can adjust the frequency of the colored Chu-Chus in the option screen, which determines the overall pace of the game. Personally, I love those goofy little bastards, and a random event every fifteen seconds or so keeps the game delightfully hectic   All righty ? so Chu Chu Rocket is loaded with enough crazy gameplay features to  keep the most hard-core gamer busy for a reasonable amount of time. But is the game fun to play? Oh, yes.  Just like most party games, the level of enjoyment increases with each added human player ? and the resulting play is seriously addicting. You've got the opportunity to screw over your buddies by steering Nekos into their rockets, and the thrill of watching hundreds of Chu-Chus pour into your rocket during ~Chu-Chu Fever.~ Though the game looks bewildering to onlookers, anyone involved in the actual game is probably having a blast.  The game looks pretty good, too. Every Chu-Chu and Neko is made out of polygons, and the game maintains a rock-solid 60fps ? even when the screen is rife with hundreds of moving objects and explosions. The audio content is just what we'd expect from Sonic Team ? bouncy music, cutesy sound effects, and a Japanese girl screaming the names of the special events. Trust us, you'll be yelling ~Chu-Chu Feee-vah!~ along with her after a while.  There are plenty of ways to play Chu Chu Rocket, and Sonic Team has gone the extra mile in terms of gameplay modes. Here's the translated version of what you see on the main menu: Four-player Battle: One to four contestants duke it out over twenty-four game boards. The first to score a set number of points is the reigning Chu-Chu Champion. Team Battle: Two groups of two players attempt to direct the Chu-Chus to their bases. Scoring is the same as Four-player Battle. Stage Challenge: One or two players have to fulfill a certain criteria ? such as rescuing all the Chu-Chus, or having a Neko eat all the Chu-Chus ? to progress. There are twenty-four of these, and you'll need to have a buddy help you out on the higher levels ?they're all about teamwork and split-second reflexes. Puzzle: One player only. Puzzle mode is a more leisurely, thought-out Chu-Chu rescuing procedure. You get a freeze-frame image of a stage, and a limited number of arrows to place. You need to drop the arrows in the correct positions, then hit the start button to see if the Chu-Chus will run to safety, get eaten by a Neko, or become stuck in an infinite loop. Beating the normal set of 24 puzzles unlocks 24 more. Puzzle Edit: This allows you to create and test your own layouts for Puzzle Mode. Save 'em on your VMS, and dish out hideous brain-stumpers to your friends! Network: One to three local players can challenge human opponents via the Internet. Homepage: Logs onto the Japanese Dricas network, and points the internal browser to the Chu Chu Rocket homepage.  You read that right. Chu Chu Rocket is the first Dreamcast title that's playable over Sega of Japan's brand-new network. Getting on-line is a cut-and-dry affair (in Japan, anyway) ? the game automatically dials the Internet service provider you use with the Dream Passport browser, and you're good to go. The first time you log in, you'll have to enter a user name and password, then pick one of a dozen servers. From there, you can enter an existing room, chat with the people inside, and launch into a round of the actual game.  Believe it or not, this works surprisingly well. Though I experienced some big-time Internet lag in one or two games, the rest of them played without a hitch, with only slight delays between button presses and arrow placements. And the whole concept of playing against real people, who are hundreds of miles away from each other, is simply a cool experience (and one that PC gamers have been enjoying for a long time). Best of all, you can have up to three local players ganging up on one faceless Joe over the net. Now that's entertainment!  In theory, American gamers with Japanese Dreamcasts should be able to play on-line as well. There's some trickery involved with dialing out, but you should be able to use your local ISP to connect to the Japanese servers. (On the other hand, if you modified your American Dreamcast to play Japanese games with the infamous ~Battery Swap~ trick, no dice ? the modem hardware is totally different.) Don't forget that you're on the other side of the world, though ? latency might be a major gameplay issue for those outside of Asia. I'd be interested in hearing from anyone from the States who's been playing online ? you can usually find me on the Sonic server, under the name Colin_IGN.   Sonic Team is committed to supporting Chu Chu Rocket with a series of on-line tournaments and various downloads, accessible through the game's website. We know for a fact that there's some stuff buried deep inside the game ? remember those cute little Chao from Sonic Adventure? You may be seeing them again...  Everything about Chu Chu Rocket oozes polish and class ? something you don't expect from a ~budget~ game (it runs for 2800 yen, or around $26). There's a ton of hidden stuff and extra doo-dads, including wacky screen savers, VMS animations, and, best of all, stickers to decorate your controllers and VMS units with! Brilliant! Chu Chu Rocket's tagline sums up my feelings nicely: ~Fun and Cheap!~ With its faultless, addicting multiplayer gaming, Sega should scoop this one up for an American release, pronto. Import gamers with Japanese systems should definitely pick this one up (be sure to spring for the ~deluxe~ version with the extra orange controller), and everyone else should keep their eyes peeled for this one to hit the States. This game's got the ~hook,~ no doubt about it. And I've got a case of Chu-Chu Feee-vah!  -- Colin ~Chu-Chu Freelancer~ Williamson, IGN DCFor the most part, Chu Chu Rocket is a solid GBA game, but thereare a couple of gripes I have with the title.  Being a fan of theDreamcast version, I'm pretty excited that Chu Chu Rocket made agreat translation to the GBA... except for the viewing size.  Granted,there's not much that can be done unless you get a development Wideboy,but with the decreased size of everything, sometimes it's hard to seewhat's going on.  One small oddity I noticed is when the timer runs outand when the rockets launch, there's a slight pause right when therockets take off - nothing huge, but a change nonetheless.  But I thinkthe biggest hurdle for players to get over is simply the gameplayitself.  Chu Chu Rocket isn't very forgiving, as players arebasically dropped in the middle of the game and left to fend forthemselves.  There is a handy tutorial mode, but it hardly prepares youfor the chaos that ensues when you battle against three other players.Obviously, the more the play, the better you'll and if you're up to thechallenge, you will definitely appreciate the excellent mix of depth and insanity that Chu Chu Rocket offers.", "date": "Nov 16, 1999"}
