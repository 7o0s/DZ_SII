{"name": "The Sims: Bustin' Out [GBA]", "name_review": "The Sims: Bustin' Out", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/02/the-sims-bustin-out-4", "text": ", an extremely popular and successful ~life simulator,~ last year made the leap from PC to console last year, but this year the series is making an even grander jump as a portable game on the Game Boy Advance. Even though some liberties had to be made to make it work on the handheld, The Sims: Bustin' Out definitely works on the GBA system. It's not quite as versatile as what's been done in past games in the series on the PC and console, but the more limited structure is still an enjoyable romp that offers a new experience to an established theme. Features Create-a-Sim (Male or Female) Eight mini-games Link cable support to trade items Cartridge save (four slots, three for GBA Sims, one for GameCube sim) Connectivity with the GameCube version The Sims is admittedly simple in concept but deep in gameplay, and it's arguably this combination of the two that's what made the game so addictive and popular. The Game Boy Advance builds upon this successful design as well: players take control over a single Sim and ensure that he's living a healthy life. If his bladder's full, you need to seek out a toilet. If he stinks, send him to the showers. If he's bored, entertain him with the various items all over town.  The Game Boy Advance version of The Sims: Bustin' Out, like the console games, features a massive list of tasks to perform, mostly involving delivery of specific items from one place to another. While money can simply be acquired by performing delivery tasks, most of the in-game cash is handed over in the different ~jobs,~ essentially little mini-games that will reward much needed Simoleans. There are mini-games that challenge players to mow lawns, serve drinks, build pizza pies, and these challenges only unlock themselves when players reach a certain point in their tasklist...or open them up through the use of connectivity between the GameCube version of The Sims: Bustin' Out.   It's not an easy romp, since several of the in-game tasks require other elements to be triggered first. Some Sims won't offer their trust right away, and you'll have to work your way through a conversation tree to say the proper things in order to get them to ~like~ you. Some items need to be repaired, and without the skills to repair it you can electrocute yourself and it's off to the hospital. Of course, nothing can happen without taking care of the basics:  Sims need food, and you'll need money to eat. Your Sim won't talk to anyone on an empty stomach, and will eventually pass out if there's no sustenance.  There's a lot of micromanagement to be done in the Sims in order to successfully perform the tasks in the adventure.   Instead of recreating on the Game Boy Advance what the console developers at Maxis are doing for The Sims: Bustin' Out, the folks at Griptonite Games (Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Return of the King for GBA) instead created a unique experience for handheld gamers. The GBA version of The Sims: Bustin' Out offers a fresh take on the Sims idea; players now have direct control over their on-screen persona, instead of the more indirect, point-and-click interface of the PC and console Sims. This move definitely makes the player feel more directly connected to their character, more fitting what's expected in a videogame instead of a PC game. And it turns The Sims into more of a RPG, without the random battles, of course.   This move to direct control does admittedly take out a lot of the branching ~randomness~ that the The Sims has been known for; the GBA game feels a lot more pre-scripted in its new design, rooted down into set tasks that never change. But on the other hand, the game is a lot more instant; players don't have to wait for their Sim to react to a command given to them. This was easily one of the more frustrating elements of The Sims, and it's thankfully not a problem in the Game Boy Advance version.  Even with the different direction for handheld version, the GBA version still retains much of what made The Sims such a success. Players have the same opportunities for personal expression; their Sim can be custom made from a set list of head, body and legs, and their in-game ~home~ can be decked out in furniture bought from the store (or traded with Sim citizens), and positioned pretty much anywhere in the area. But the choices in customization are limited due to the restrictions of both media size and processor speed. Since the designers use pre-rendered sprites for the Sim characters, the player can't tweak his look with a huge variety of skins like the consoles and PCs with their more 3D designs. And because the cartridge size is comparatively much smaller than the disc based bigger brothers, there's not much room for a massive catalog of items to acquire. Still, even with the limits, the GBA version indeed looks, plays, and feels like a Sims game. The Game Boy Advance version of The Sims: Bustin' Out isn't quite as extravagant as the upcoming console games because of the standard limitations of the Game Boy platform. But as comparatively limited as the GBA version is, it's still a well-designed, casual game, and it definitely fits the bill for an on-the-go version of one of the most popular game franchises around.", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
