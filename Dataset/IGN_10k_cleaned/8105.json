Centuries old. New Mexico? Yeah, back in 1912. New Super Mario Bros.? For a while, sure, but not in a decade. And that's the problem seen here. This game's called New Adventure Island, but it's not so fresh. It's a game now 15 years removed from its original release, and anything new there might have been then has long since been eligible for retirement.   New Adventure Island finds Hudson mascot Master Higgins back in action, island-hopping to the rescue of his beautiful bride. It's the fourth time Tina's gotten herself into trouble, as New Adventure Island was the fourth game in the series when it arrived back in 1992. Previous games had come from the NES and the SNES. This one went to the Turbo.   The transition to the TurboGrafx platform meant a graphical upgrade for the franchise beyond its 8-bit roots, but the gameplay remained largely untouched. New Adventure Island feels and plays much like the first Adventure Island felt and played  so much so that it's almost more of a remake than a sequel. It's a side-scrolling platformer. You, as Higgins, run and jump through jungles and caves, collecting power-ups, attacking enemies, clearing checkpoints and dying if you get hit just once. Pretty standard for the platformer genre back in the late '80s and early '90s. But the Adventure Island series always had a little something extra to pick up the pace.          The fruit gauge. A combination life meter and countdown clock, the fruit gauge is displayed at the top of the screen and is endlessly depleting itself. Time ticks away the blocks on the gauge  if you don't move quickly enough through each stage, it will empty completely and Higgins will die. The meter will also take a hit when Higgins does. Contact with enemies with kill the Master straight out, but minor bumps like tripping over a rock will just knock off a fruit gauge block.   It's called the fruit gauge because it's refueled by the power of citrus. Grabbing Vitamin C-enriched foods like apples, watermelons and banana bunches will refill the meter, giving you more time to clear each level. New Adventure Island's platforming play, then, is a balance between both moving quickly and collecting enough fruits to give yourself the leeway needed to take extra time navigating the more difficult sections of each stage.   The game is separated into multiple worlds  or islands  each with a different graphical theme and each with multiple levels. An animal-headed boss character throws down at the end of each island, and defeating him saves one of six kidnapped children. Save all six and the way is open to the final confrontation, where you and Master Higgins will take on the evil Baron Bronsky to rescue Tina. The game feels fairly lengthy overall, meaning that if you get on board with the basics of its platforming gameplay and can handle its considerable challenge factor, you should have a lot of island-hopping fun.  Playing New Adventure Island is a fairly fun experience here on the Wii, and it's a good game to represent the overall Adventure Island series. But that said, the game is not inventive, engaging or timeless enough to separate itself from the pack. The Virtual Console is already home to several spectacular platformers of the past, including major hits from Bonk, Sonic and Mario.  So while Master Higgins' fourth adventure isn't a total letdown, you're still better off spending your Wii Points on a game that doesn't feel quite as old as ~New~ Adventure Island.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
