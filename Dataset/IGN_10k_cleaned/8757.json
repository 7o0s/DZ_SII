The PlayStation 3 and PSP games, originally scheduled for release at the end of 2006 to coincide with the PS3 launch, were delayed for months on end. Both games have finally shipped, but there were pretty big differences between the launches. While the PlayStation 3 release got plenty of time in the limelight with a healthy advertising campaign, helping to push a game that in most ways nicely lived up to the previously-released Xbox 360 and PC versions, the PSP title is almost entirely opposite. It snuck out to store shelves, its launch date so quiet that it surprised even us, and unlike the PS3 release, it unfortunately doesn't live up to the series' rather high watermark.   The reason for a number of the game's issues is the lack of a second analog stick on the PSP. As there's no second stick, like most other PSP shooters Rainbow Six: Vegas uses the face buttons for aiming (or movement, if you swap controls to a southpaw-friendly setup). Because of this, you're left with only the D-Pad, L and R to swap weapons, change vision modes, change your stance, use gadgets, open doors, use of the targeting lock and firing. In other words, the game is simply too complicated for the system.   Those bottles are deadly! You may notice that taking cover doesn't get its own button. While it's certainly nice that this feature made its way to the PSP release, it's a clunky implementation that doesn't work nearly as well as it does on the console releases. Instead of having a trigger to take and release cover, you walk to or away from a wall to automatically take cover. This works awkwardly in that you need to be looking straight at the cover to duck behind it, so if you're under fire you need to stop and look straight ahead of you and hold forward in order to get out of the way of incoming fire. Likewise, getting out of cover requires that you move straight back from it first, so you can't easily release from cover and run to another hiding spot.   You can work around this and you do get used to its feel, but when an enemy is doing a very good job of hiding behind a wall and you need to move quickly to new spots to get the drop on him, you'll run into problems doing so quickly and unscathed.   Another issue that is counter to the normal Rainbow Six setup is that even though you're part of a two-man team, you don't actually get to play as a squad. Swapping between Shawn and Brian, you'll split your duties in each mission between having an assault setup and a sniper loadout. Not having the team stuff removes most of the tactics that Rainbow Six is known for and basically devolves it into a standard (and quite boring) first-person shooter.   While the mission sections with Brian work fine as he carries an automatic weapon, while playing as the sniper-centric Shawn you'll be forced to take a sniper rifle into each mission. While this is fine when you're going in quietly and can take enemies out from a distance, it isn't fine when you need to clear room after room when they already know you're there. Taking part in 50-foot shootouts with a slow sniper rifle isn't fun at all, and the handguns are essentially useless against anyone who doesn't have their back turned to you. It also doesn't help that you can't zoom-in while behind cover, making the sight on your sniper rifle useless in these situations. Oh, and you can't lock-on with the sniper rifle at all, either.   The cover system is here, but it's clunky. One on-paper positive note for the game is its online Infrastructure support, though unfortunately it isn't too much more fun than the single-player game. Part of the problem is that it plays a good deal differently as you can't use the L button to lock onto enemies, which greatly changes the way you'll play the game. Its four-player support does work really well and we never experienced any noticeable lag in our time with the game, but two-on-two games in some of these maps are a little too small for exciting games.   There is a technical issue here in that the game will sometimes pause for a couple seconds when you kill someone, which is a problem that also affects the single-player game. While playing alone it isn't that big of a deal as the whole game essentially gets paused, but this certainly isn't nice online. It's not a deal-breaker, but it isn't too welcome, either.   Vegas' biggest strength is that although it has a fair number of flaws, there aren't too many other straight-up shooters on the PSP, which means that folks who only own a PSP may find something somewhat unique here. But when compared with other games in the genre like the SOCOM titles, it simply can't be recommended.Closing CommentsTom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas on the PSP has a number of gameplay issues, like the clunky cover system, the sections where you're forced to clear room after room with only a sniper rifle and more. Its online works reasonably well, but it simply isn't fun. Your money is much better spent elsewhere.", "date": "Jul 5, 2007"}
