If it doesn't have a 600 page manual weighing four kilograms, it's simply not worth flying, right? That's what I thought too. As somebody who'd earned their virtual wings flying IL-2, Falcon 4.0 and LO:MAC, the possibility of enjoying Ace Combat 6 seemed as remote as Maverick not coming out of the closet in the inevitable Top Gun sequel.    When I first realised that there was no way to slip into a flat spin, or that my jet was equipped with over one hundred missiles, it seemed that I was going to prove myself correct, which is always a nice feeling. ~Meh, this game is for children,~ I thought smugly to myself. But as a mutant stealth bomber unleashed a salvo of nuclear missiles onto the gorgeous city of Gracemeria far below me, something changed. I forgot that this plane didn't have ECM. I wasn't concerned that the Doppler-notch manoeuvre wouldn't be of any help in this game. All I could think about was taking down the nasty enemy aces who'd just laid waste to my home city. I watched in awe as the sky filled with dogfights and missile contrails, while ground-based anti-air filled the sky with lead. This was a spectacle; an aerial battle the scope of which I'd  never seen in a game. Maybe this game was for kids, but my inner-child was loving it.    Check out the making of Ace Combat 6 here.   It might not be a true simulator, but it certainly looks like one. Perhaps that's why I fell for this tasty serving of plane-porn  it's easily the finest looking flying game I've seen outside of an RAAF training base. The planes truly are photorealistic, and when you're flying at altitude, the terrain isn't far off either. It's only when you zoom through the weeds that you'll notice it's quite flat, but this complaint isn't unique to Ace Combat 6  every flying game has similar issues. Explosions are suitably debris-laden, and the smoke and cloud effects will have you wondering how the developers managed to do all this, yet still maintain a rock solid frame rate. Even when the heavens are filled with dozens of aircraft, hundreds of missiles and more tracer fire than the night sky over Baghdad in '91, it still purrs by at a silky smooth pace. It's truly one of the most impressive graphics engines to whip the 360's three processors into shape. Replays are even more stunning than the in-game visuals, as the camera rotates and zooms to show off the action you missed while you were busy evading missiles.   Helping to bring the stunning visuals to life is an amazing amount of radio chatter. With so many units taking part in each battle, the airwaves are continuously filled with frantic calls for help and combat updates. Not to mention the occasional bit of cheesy banter, but sadly we didn't notice anybody crying out ~Yeehaw, Jester's dead!~ The booms of exploding warheads are suitably rumbly, with a nice delay between the time you see the explosion and the sound of it hitting your aircraft. Unfortunately the tacky Jap-rock tunes wear thin pretty quickly, but the ability to crank up your own tunes on the 360, Iron Eagle style (anybody remember that flick?) means it's not much of an issue.   I'm punchin' out Mav! Aaaaaieeee. Thump.   The cries for help from allied wingmen point to one of the most improved features of the game. While early missions start off relatively simple, by mission five they're comprised of multiple objectives. Completing all of these objectives gradually becomes impossible, forcing you to choose which is the most important. It's often the shrill screams of terror over the radio that will help you figure out where you're needed most.    These multi-path missions mix up the types of objectives, from ground-pounding to air-superiority to escort missions. Once you've played through it as a Maverick wannabe, you can start from scratch, taking out tanks in your shiny new A-10. It's a good thing the missions have plenty of replayability, because without it the single player campaign would be woefully short. With the afterburners kicking in, most players will soar through the campaign in around six hours, so revisiting completed missions is a must if you want to get value for money.     While playing through the campaign, you'll be presented with one of the most nonsensical storylines I've seen since Mulholland Drive. It's got something to do with a little girl, dancing angels and bank robbers, but it's all so weird that you'll probably skip most of it. Which would be a shame, as the in-game visuals for these cutscenes are actually quite spectacular.    A new addition to the game is the allied support system. Turn enough enemy jets into piles of smoking scrap metal, and you'll be rewarded with additional support. Hold up on the D-pad and your squadron will zoom forwards to kick some booty. Hold down and they'll clear your six of any nasty bogies. During more hectic moments, use of this ability is essential if you want to avoid riding the silk elevator to the ground. You've also got a single wingman with you at all times, who does the same job as the support guys, but is much less effective.   I'm gonna hit the brakes and he'll fly right by.  Don't expect the world's most realistic physics simulation of a fighter jet  after all, this is an arcade flyer. However, it's still surprisingly deep while remaining accessible  the holy grail of game developers. Fly too slow and your plane will stall, while pulling high-G moves at low altitude is a great way to end up with a face full of dirt. Dodging missiles is very easy  just crank the stick in any direction, light the fires, and soar off to safety. It would have been nice if chaff/flares were included, making missile evasion a little more challenging.    Actually, that's probably the biggest complaint I had with the single player campaign  it all seemed just a little bit easy. Once I knew which objectives were most important, I rarely failed a mission. It could be because I've spent so much time with more difficult sims that I tended to breeze through the game, so your mileage may vary.   By now most Xbox 360 users have realised that cooperative gameplay is The Way Of The Future, so it's no surprise to see it's included here. But active teamwork didn't really seem necessary to beat the missions.    This screenshot is classified. I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.   Likewise with the team deathmatch head to head online mode, which supports up to 16 players. It's quite frantic and hectic, but I didn't see a shred of teamwork once. It was a case of every man for himself. However, the siege mode is very different. Each team has to take out enemy objectives, requiring the teams to split into offensive and defensive groups. Aircraft choice is very important as well, necessitating plenty of communication amongst team-mates. A nice touch is the filter over the voice comms, making every player sound like they're using military radios.   Even if youve never tried an arcade flyer before, Ace Combat 6 is at least worthy of a rent. The amazing visuals combined with massive, intense battles make it a total blast while it lasts. A longer campaign would have been nice, but the online Siege mode should keep you going for a while to come.", "date": "Dec 6, 2007"}
