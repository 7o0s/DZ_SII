And it's a follow up to Hasbro's first PC port of the game -- which it includes. The game reflects the world during the whimsical spring of 1942. Hitler has solidified his gains in Europe and begins to turn eastward. As German troops pour into the Soviet Union, Rommel is waging a war of mobile armor against the British in the deserts of North Africa. Meanwhile, back in the Pacific, the Japanese have dealt a crushing blow to the American fleet at Pearl Harbor and are poised to take over the whole of the Pacific. Enter you. You take the role of commander of any of the five nationalities in the game and decide military policy. But you'll also be in charge of the economics of the game, at least as far as they relate to your military strategy.  It's the diversity of strategies that really makes this game so great. The Russians and Germans must fight a bloody war of attrition along the Eastern Front. The British must defend India from attack and maintain parity in Africa all while trying to wear down the German defenses and invade Fortress Europe. The Japanese and American players fight primarily a naval war in the early stages of the game. But the strategies are further divided among the alliance groups. The Axis have a huge military advantage at the start of the game. The Allies, while weak in material, have the lead in economic resources. If they can hold out long enough, their superior infrastructure will tip the balance in their favor.  The trick is for the Axis to gain enough momentum through a vigorous and rapid offensive to take the economic edge away from the Allies. How, you ask? Simple. Each territory on the map is worth a certain number of Industrial Production Certificates. At the end of your turn, you collect an amount of money equal to the number of IPCs you own. These IPCs are then spent (next turn) on weapons development and unit production. If you choose to develop weapons, you can obtain things like jet power (adding to the defense of your fighters), long range aircraft or advanced production techniques (reducing the cost of purchasing units).  Other than weapons development, every dollar you can get your hands on will be spent on units. Except of course, the money you set aside to purchase AA guns or factories. There are 10 military units in the game. The land-based units include infantry and tanks. The tank's ability to blitz through enemy controlled territories makes it an effective weapon for gaining the initiative. A new addition to Iron Blitz is the Marine. Marines are just like regular infantry unless they happen to be making an amphibious assault. Then they perform as well as tanks. Fighters and bombers are the two air units. Bombers can be used to attack enemy units or the industrial production certificates of a country directly.  The ship models in the game are equally versatile. The transport is used for ferrying troops and AA guns across water. Submarines are excellent weapons for attacking superior forces. They can launch an initial strike and be gone before the defender has a chance to counterattack. Carriers act as mobile bases for your fighters and battleships provide the muscle. They also have the ability to bombard enemy coastlines prior to an amphibious landing. The destroyer has been added especially for Iron Blitz in order to balance out the submarine. It completely negates the submarine's first attack power.  Combat in the game is resolved with electronic dice and the small unit board from the board game. That's such a nice touch. Where other companies would try to ~improve~ upon the experience of playing a PC port, Hasbro has opted to cling to the board game concept even in the PC format. That's what's so fun about this game. It preserves the feel of the board game while giving you access to the speed and organizational power of the PC. Where was I? Oh, right, the dice. The attacker rolls to see whom he kills, the defender counterattacks, and the whole process is repeated until one side is dead or the attacker withdraws. It's a lot more exciting than it sounds, trust me.  You can set victory conditions in the game. The default victory condition involves the capture of two of your opponents' capitals while simultaneously retaining control of your own. You can set an economic level as a victory point. Then when the Axis (or whoever) get a certain number of IPCs, they win. You can, alternatively, opt for a total destruction scenario where nothing will do but the complete and total annihilation of your enemies. I like this idea.  Iron Blitz uses the new Third Edition rules for Axis and Allies. This new set fixes several of the inconsistencies and quirks found in the Second Edition. For those of you who feel that any changes would screw up the game that you love, you can opt to play with the Second Edition rules. The new rules allow for several new movements -- submarines can submerge instead of withdrawing, planes may retreat from amphibious assaults, new naval units may be placed in enemy occupied zones and multiple AA guns may occupy the same territory. Additionally, when an aircraft carrier is sunk, its planes may land one space away from the battle. Oh yeah, Western Canada no longer borders on the Atlantic Ocean. This keeps the Germans from launching their attack into North America via the Yukon.  Some other variants are accessible through the game set-up screen. The air transport ability is a function of bombers. Each bomber can move one infantry unit to any square within the bomber's range. Scorched earth tactics permit the destruction of industrial complexes and anti-aircraft guns. The best of the optional rules gives each battleship two hits before it's destroyed. This makes a lot more sense to me than the way battleships are currently handled.  Iron Blitz includes seven pre-set scenarios. Three scenarios take the war all the way back to 1939. The Axis is poised to attack an unsuspecting world. The first plays out under the normal alliance structure. Two alternatives are included -- one where Japan and Russia switch allegiance, and one where the US remains neutral throughout the conflict. A 1942 scenario is included where Russia remains neutral. Two scenarios follow the conflict closer to the war's end. In both scenarios the Russian Bear ~demands land for the blood of her children~ and precipitates another war -- this time on the side of Germany or Japan. The final scenario plays out under Cold War conditions. Russia squares off against the US and UK in theaters all across the world.  The scenarios are fun. Switching up the alliance structure makes for some interesting conflicts. The only problem is that the original game was designed to begin under a very specific set of circumstances. Any deviation from this initial position runs the risk of upsetting the game balance. I think that the guys at Hasbro have done a really great job of setting up new wars where things aren't too heavily slanted to one side or another. But still, the original 1942 set-up isn't in any danger of losing its position at the top of my list. Like I said, the other scenarios are fun, but the don't offer the same challenge or excitement of the original game.  The game also has a unit editor. You can change the icon and attributes for each of the units in the game. Stronger tanks for the Germans are the first obvious modification that springs to mind, but you can also use the tool to buff up the Japanese fighters or the US bombers. To tell the truth though, I really don't see much use for this tool. The units are very well balanced as it is, and I have neither the patience nor the inclination to monkey around with the bitmap files. But hey, that's me; I'm sure there are several people out there who will really get into this feature.  Now that I've covered what I love about this game, I have to step back and talk about its weak points. First, and this is sort of a piddley issue, there's no national summary screen. Now before all of you who have the game start writing us nasty letters telling us that there is such a feature, let me explain what I mean. What I want is a list of all units I currently possess. That would be so helpful when it comes time to buy new units. I would be able to see where the deficiencies are in my army and fill them accordingly. On the tabletop version, this was easy -- you could see the whole board at once. The whole map screen on Iron Blitz is nearly useless if you're looking for individual units.  I'm more concerned with the AI in the game. Don't get me wrong. It's good. But it could be better. I've been playing the board game for years now so I imagine that my standards are high. But I think that gamers who will be interested in this game have probably had some experience with the game and will be expecting a bigger challenge. While it was sometimes a ~near run thing,~ I have yet to lose a game to the computer. The AI as an ally is much better than it was in the previous version of the PC game. It coordinates defense and offense much more naturally and sensibly than before.  But hang it on the doors of the Hasbro Studios: ~We make great PC versions of board games.~ Given the fact that the company bought the Avalon Hill library last year, I think wargamers have a lot to look forward to. The games all (so far) have taken what's really great about board games -- pieces, maps, multiple opponents -- and combined them with what's great about PC games -- flexibility, arbitration and rules resolution, multimedia presentations. The result is nothing less than fantastic. It ensures that each game is ~flashy~ enough to grab your attention but still faithful to the spirit and design of the original. As a sidenote, the game ends with a fairly long interview with Larrry Harris, the man behind the design of the board game. He discusses his inspiration, the game's development and his views on the PC version.  And if that wasn't enough, Hasbro is offering a $10 rebate to owners of the original PC game...as long as you buy Iron Blitz, that is.  -- Stephen ButtsIt is a good time to be a strategy gamer.In this season of great strategy games, TimeGate has offered us not one but two fantastic titles. Though I think Kohan 2 is probably the better game (by a slight margin), the World War 2 theme of Axis and Allies definitely makes it different enough from Kohan to stand on its own. It's a hell of a fun experience no matter which way you look at it.I miss some of the customization options of Kohan, particularly in terms of company creation, but the subject matter and challenge of the campaign missions more than made up for the loss. I can't honestly see myself playing much of the World War 2 mode. It makes total sense that TimeGate included it, of course, and, given their reputation, it also makes sense that it would pale somewhat next to the RTS portions of the game. Thankfully the campaign mode provides its own framework for a series of great real-time battles.For fans of real time strategy, those battles are more than good enough on their own to justify getting this game. Strategy game vets who aren't familiar with TimeGate's model may be challenged at first but they'll eventually come to appreciate some of the new twists on the traditional RTS concepts.", "date": "Nov 17, 1999"}
