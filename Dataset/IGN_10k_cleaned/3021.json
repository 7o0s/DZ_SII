{"name": "Shadow Master", "name_review": "Shadow Master", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/02/25/shadow-master-2", "text": "Unfortunately, the gods of the game industry have clay feet. Psygnosis, the highest profile Western game publishers in the PlayStation world have produced some of the best titles, like WipeOut, WipeOut XL, Colony Wars, and G-Police. Yet, crap games like Shipwreckers and the Adventrures of Lomax rear their ugly heads when Psygnosis is determined to tarnish their own reputation with titles like Shadow Master.   In theory, Shadow Master is supposed to by a combat driving game, like a futuristic Vigilante 8, with lots of cool weapons and photon-torpedo-esque effects. However, abilities like strafing or looking up and down seem strange, being stuck inside a souped-up 4x4, and it just gets worse from there.  Gameplay-wise, Shadow Master plays like a rich man's copy of Machinehead. It's eerily similar in both control and general feel, although Psygnosis' version has a slicker interface. Once again, though, it's sloppy. Really sloppy. Besides the targeting graphic, there is little, if any, easily available information. There is no map, weapon control is unclear, and piloting your vehicle is ugly. If that's not disheartening, try aiming at a gun turret behind a wall and getting stuck in a corner.  Level design is a nightmare. The enemy AI is pathetic -- basic ~see enemy, try to kill enemy~ mentality, while the graphical engine leaves plenty of seams and pop-up to keep you confused. Endless corridors of the same texture bore players quickly, and soon, you're going to be wondering whether there's any point to it. Unlike Machinehead, every mission has but a single objective (which you can't call up again in text format) -- and that's seek and destroy.  Graphics remain the company's strongest department, with its hallmark specialties -- light-sourcing and graphic design -- nearly redeeming it. Unfortunately, the graphical engine, with ugly polygon glitching, seaming, and a quirky auto-aim feature not only destroy the visual appeal, but also hamper gameplay.  Everything about Shadow Master screams ~second rate.~ Pass on it and wait for Psygonosis ~A~ team publishes their next title.", "date": "Feb 25, 1998"}
