It conjures no feelings of relaxation or nirvana. Neither does it have anything to do with Ms. Bliss from the early years of Saved by the Bell. The sad reality is that Bliss Island is a collection of mini-games that range from piss poor to being competitive with free internet flash games. Save your 400 Microsoft Points (US $5); this one isn't worth your time or money.   The single-player game takes you on an ~adventure~ through a series of seven mini-games broken into stages, complete with a text intro and some budget fireworks at the end of each of the three levels of difficulty. If you want, you can also tackle the games individually in a challenge mode. The hook that binds each mini-game together is the Zwooph, a mythical creature that shoots puffs of air to make clouds. Each game uses this air jet concept and some simple physics to create puzzles and basic platforming gameplay.     The mini-games are about as basic as you can get. In fact, you can find better alternatives to every one of them on the web for free. One involves directing balls of fruit into a creature's mouth. It's about as exciting as it sounds. Another is a simple race where slamming on the A button to boost continuously through gates is as deep as the game gets. There are two platforming levels, one a timed vertical climb and the other a top-down affair. The latter also has the added bonus of a ridiculously annoying camera, somehow.    The list is rounded out with a billiards game (knock like-colored balls into one another), a take on Space Invaders that involves boosting around to take out oncoming bricks of the same color and Cave Adventures. This last one is the most interesting, but it isn't much more than a more complex version of everyone's favorite helicopter flash game. If each mini-game were as interesting as Cave Adventures, there might be something worth looking at here. Instead, it's a single bright spot in an ill-conceived package.   Cave Adventure is the best of the bunch. In terms of fun, there's not much here and the presentation and graphics are on par with the gameplay. The artwork on the menus and loading screens is worse than Saturday morning cartoons from the 1980s and there's absolutely nothing done in the game that looks like it is taking advantage of the Xbox 360 hardware. The gameplay doesn't even run in true HD -- Bliss Island puts a border around the edges. It's just as well. The low-res textures would look even worse without the borders. The sound effects and music are as cookie-cutter as they come.   Bliss Island is ostensibly aimed at the casual market with its bright visuals and simple design, but even that target is missed thanks to aggravating levels of difficultly in the latter stages. There is a challenge here for those willing to take it. Playing through the adventure will probably take you four or five hours on the first try, longer if you want to win all of the medals and achievements.   There's also a two-player adversarial mode with three game types, one of which doesn't have a corollary in the single player game. There's a soccer game, a race to collect fruit and a multiplayer version of the Brick Invaders game. Winning nets you the praise we all crave with a nice ~Level Complete~ message to signify your success. Alright! Oddly, Bliss Island doesn't support any same-screen multiplayer so you'll have to hop onto Xbox Live to find an opponent. If Bliss Island were a website of free flash games, it would be worthwhile as a distraction. Paying for it is not a good idea.", "date": "Mar 12, 2008"}
