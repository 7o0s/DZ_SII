One might think that would be enough.  However, that opinion certainly isn't shared by Outrage Entertainment (or myself for that matter), since they've decided to go ahead and drain even more hours from our would-be productive lives with Mercenary, the expansion pack to their latest upgrade to the 3-D battle universe.   For those of you who may have been cut off from the Descent universe in a sealed cave somewhere with a bucket over your head and some berries stuck in your ears, the game concept here is quite simple.  Players gain control of a ship of their choice from the available inventory, and are set loose screaming into the fray of a 3-D battle arena.  The idea, of course, is to blow the snot out of everything that moves using any of the game's impressive arsenal of weapons.  More specifically, anything that shoots at you needs to be sent to The Great Beyond quickly, or else you'll be headed there yourself sooner than you'd like.  This fresh installment welcomes veteran players with 7 new single player (plus co-op) and 4 new multiplayer missions with a host of different battlefields.  Further adding to the entree, a shiny, new ship called the Black Pyro has been added in. You know, just for flavor. There aren't really any new weapons to speak of but the original game had enough of those as it is.  However, the designers were good enough to throw in the 'D3Edit' level creation software with the package, thus ensuring that the internet will be teeming with player-created levels over the next several months.  Multiplayer aside, Mercenary will be able to challenge even those hardcore pilots out there who managed to muscle their way through the full version.  The expansion levels start out much more difficult than those of the original did. But since the designers assume that you've completed that title before hopping into the Black Pyro, this should come as no surprise.  In fact, you'll begin the one of the first missions immediately under fire from three different enemies.  Without the experience that comes from blowing through Descent 3, your mission could end quite abruptly.  Since Mercenary uses the same engine as its big brother, the graphics and sound involved here are nearly identical.  That isn't really a bad thing though, since both of these aspects were handled quite well in that version.  You'll get the most out of that 3-D card you emptied your wallet for awhile back, and expect your slick sound system to be pushed to the limit.  The weapon firing animations, sounds, explosions, and lighting effects are all top notch, so you won't have much to complain about there.  The only things I thought could use some improvement with this title, as well as the full version of Descent 3, were the game speed and the absolute necessity for a joystick.  However, the use of afterburners alleviates the first of these small wrinkles.  Alas, the other is not addressed.  Attempting to play through this onslaught with anything other than a joystick is nearly impossible, or at the very least incredibly frustrating.  The ol' mouse-keyboard combo seems to work wonderfully for other shooters like Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.  However, the addition of movement in the third dimension necessitates a few more abilities in the area of control.  These small gripes aside, Mercenary is an outstanding achievement worthy to be in anyone's collection who devoted anything close to a significant portion of their free time to Descent 3.  If you haven't picked up either of these yet, and like first person shooters, you're missing out on some serious bonding time between you and your PC.  Run out, grab yourself a nice crispy joystick, and then flip on the answering machine.  You're gonna be here for awhile.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Jan 25, 2000"}
