{"name": "Korea: Forgotten Conflict", "name_review": "Korea: Forgotten Conflict", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/23/korea-forgotten-conflict", "text": "A lot of us have played and loved Commandos in one of its iterations, and while the third instalment has been a bit of a step in a different direction for the series, the game has still set the benchmark when it comes to tactical top down action. We'd be just about betting the farm that the makers of Korea: Forgotten Conflict have played Commandos at least a few thousand times as it is obvious that this game depicting commando style action during the Korean War is strongly influenced by Pyro's popular effort.   Imitation may be one of the highest forms of flattery, but you'd better be sure that your attempts to mimic something great are reasonable in themselves or else you are going to look foolish pretty quickly. Sadly this is exactly what happens as Forgotten Conflict is buggy, awkward to play and needed a lot of patching even to get the thing working at all!   The action starts with a dramatic, but simple video depiction of the desperate state of circumstances that the South Koreans and their American allies found themselves in at the start of the Korean War. You, in your role as commando extraordinaire, are then plonked into a training mission which sees you having to board and stop a train carrying supplies to the enemy.   There is a simple voiceover driven tutorial which explains the basics. This is workable enough even if it is easy to fall out of sequence with the instructions if you use your initiative too much.   The game is played using the ever familiar top down isometric view of the action and the landscape is reasonably detailed even if it seems to impinge upon game speed.   You can pause the game to assign orders. More often than not it is wise to do so as you will be extremely lucky if you can effectively get your man to do what you want him to do in real-time. Stopping play to make sure your orders are correct might sound like a reasonable compromise in this circumstance, as it does make sure you can do what you need to on most occasions.      However it also absolutely destroys any sense of dramatic tension or real-time game flow that you might experience. Instead, playing becomes a series of stop start passages of play with you watching the action being played out in between pauses to hand out new orders. Forgotten Conflict may have well have been a turn-based game with movement points as this would have been more enjoyable. As a real-time effort the game just fails to generate the sense of immediacy that real-time is made to deliver.   Graphically the game is nothing to write home about. The character animation is pretty rudimentary. Also while some of the landscapes are quite detailed, they suffer from 'invisible wall' syndrome. You will find your progress blocked by a force field which prevents movement even when the way appears clear. The maps are quite large, so it does take a fair bit of wandering off the beaten track (most of the time) to find these blockages, but sometimes they appear in odd and frustrating spots.   Getting a good look at the map is at times annoying too as the scroll command isn't as effective as it could be and the screen sometimes scrolls painfully past (even on a Radeon 9800 with a 2.8 gig machine!).   There are more than a few destructive toys in your arsenal to play with. Bazookas, heavy explosives machine guns, knives and even tanks can be brought to bear on your enemies.    This is probably just as well though as you are seriously outnumbered and your enemies seem to all be crack shots who can hit you very quickly and at often absurdly long ranges. Indeed at times you will find it annoying how good your foes are as marksmen. However this ability to gun you down from at times very long distances is counterbalanced by some of the most absurd AI programming to ever grace a game of this kind.    Depending on the enemy you face you will find yourself quickly targeted and dealt with or ignored, even when you are so close to your enemies they could spit on you. This is hard to get used to, as some of your enemies are so dumb that putting their khaki greens on the right way around would probably be too much challenge for them.    The in-game audio is minimalist, with occasional odd changes of pace when you remember that the soundtrack is supposed to punctuate what is happening on screen. The sound effects are also 'tinny' and poor. Overall the soundtrack doesn't add to the atmosphere of the game, instead it compromises it.   The inventory system is also flawed (something which isn't uncommon in this sort of game) and grabbing and moving items can be a chore, as is searching and moving bodies. Indeed the animation for this last function is slow and you will find you can be quickly and easily gunned down while you gently put a body down. In reality you'd have flung the cadaver and whipped out your weapon of choice a hell of a lot faster.   There are some nice weather effects which at least try and make the point that you are playing through in a dynamic world with changing climactic conditions, but this garnishing is small compensation when you remember that so many other more fundamental aspects of the game's performance are flawed.    The levels set on the streets of Seoul are perhaps the highlight, but they don't absolve the game of its principle problem, which is the fiddly control system.   You do pickup more comrades after starting with a lone man at the beginning of the game and this makes the challenges more interesting, while also compounding the problems with the fiddly controls.You might have enjoyed Commandos and be keen for something different which is set in another theatre of war. You might even like the idea of Korea: Forgotten Conflict. However it is pretty unlikely that you will find much satisfaction if you are brave enough to play this game.This game just doesn't do what you'd hope it would. The controls, presentation and technology all let the game down. It is buggy, inconsistent and cantankerous. Forgotten Conflict isn't just a title, it is also sound advice to anyone considering this game, as you should just forget about buying it.", "date": "Jan 23, 2004"}
