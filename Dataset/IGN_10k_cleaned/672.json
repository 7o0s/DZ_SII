While the initial Sunsoft  games on Genesis and Game Boy were great in their respective time periods,  the subsequent Bat games (by Acclaim, Konami, Sega, and others) were dramatic  failures that guanoed on the license. Konami tried to slip this latest Bat game  through the radar in the guise of Catwoman, but to no avail  -- this game  should not be part of your Game Boy Color utility belt for any reason.  Features Nine Bat-levels. Bat-password to save your Bat-game. Cinematic Bat-cut still screens Available for the Bat-Game Boy Color only.   Catwoman follows the exploits of the unscrupulous arch-enemy of Batman. When contracted to steal a crystal skull, the feline femme fatale instead decides to pilfer for her own stash. Unfortunately, it seems that this prized  possession is the key element in a mega-weapon that will double the power of  an energy projector so that it can obliterate cities in a single second. Why  bother doubling the power, you say? Why not just let the weapon take two  measly seconds to destroy a city? Well, the criminal mastermind doesn't always  think things fully through, and neither do the designers of this game.  Gameplay in Catwoman is a semi-exploratory adventure as Catwoman prowls  through the game's nine levels. (Nine levels? A cat has nine lives? Clever,  eh.)  The levels are vast warehouses and jungles with all kind of little  nooks and crannies to seek out. Unfortunately, the designers didn't see fit  to add weapons, power-ups, or other hidden goodies that would give reason to  exploring, so there's no purpose to the game besides going left and beating  up enemies in the way.  Control is complex, but you'd expect much more from a Game Boy Color game --better adventures have been done countless times on the standard Game Boy.  Catwoman has dozens of moves at her command (flips, wall leaps, claw attacks),  none of which make her as agile as the cat she portrays. She has a useless  stealth feature where she ducks into the background (jumping or crouching is  always more practical, since sometimes she takes hits while in stealth), and  all of her techniques fail when you need them most. For instance, the wall leap and Bionic Commando-like whip have terrible control, leading to death often as you wail on the buttons trying to get the moves to work before you drop down into a pit). She can't even grab a ledge in mid-air, so you're constantly fighting Catwoman to line up with a ledge (somewhat like the old Prince of Persia, only more frustrating). There is also a problem with collision detection -- often Catwoman will get stuck on a small box trying to get past the pixel of an enemies' head walking the platform under your box.  So why is this a Game Boy Color only game? Couldn't be the graphics or sound  -- the game looks and sounds terrible. Catwoman is a tiny little sprite with  limited animation and slim detail, while her mindless foes are similarly  uninteresting. Catwoman dons a special suit at one point, but her abilities  don't change -- in fact, her techniques are hobbled by the even fewer  animation frames for the second suit. There are no huge bosses, no fantastic  special effects, no voice samples or FMV to push the boundaries -- it's just  a plain game that could have been done a decade ago on the green screen Game  Boy system. Cinemas screens break up the monotony, but give no reason for the  Catwoman character over just another Batman game (except, of course, to show  off Catwoman's ample... puppies, if you will).I'm going to spoil the ending for you, seeing as it's completely predictable: after a stupefying anticlimax, a certain spandex-clad flying rodent shows up and brings with him the credits. Now that you know what you expected all along is true, there's no reason left to check out this kitty's catbox. All you'll find is poop.", "date": "Feb 2, 2000"}
