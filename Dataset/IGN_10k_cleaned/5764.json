{"name": "Constantine", "name_review": "Constantine", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/14/constantine", "text": "Although the movie has already come and gone from theaters, typically prime time to release a mobile game based on a licensed film, Warner Bros. Constantine can always count on the DVD release to generate a little hype. Besides, with the sorry state of blockbusters so far this early summer, Constantine will easily be recognizable when it appears on decks.   Constantine is not entirely based on the movie -- it lifts characters and locations, but that plot follows events prior to the opening act of the film. Constantine's driver, Chaz, is here in full cabbie mode, ready to spirit Constantine from one scene to another. Papa Midnite still holds court in his infernal nightclub. Beeman still acts as a holy water-hawking Q, ready to equip Constantine with the latest in demon-fighting gadgetry. Thanks to their presence, Constantine's removal from the film timeline should have zero effect on fans of the potential franchise.   Constantine is an action-adventure game set in Los Angeles, where you must take down a demonic force under the tutelage of Balthazar, one of the most nattily-dressed devils you'll ever see. You must exorcize demons from people through a little mini-game when not blasting them with your shotgun or lobbing holy water like a grenade. These weapons are a little sensitive, so make sure you have your shot before pressing the action button. In addition to using weapons to clear out demons, you can use some devastating magic spells. These spells are also used in solving some of the game's puzzles, but these are infrequent.   This genre, the top-down adventure, is seeing much more action in mobile gaming lately and while Constantine certainly looks great, it's game play lands square in the middle of the pack. Picking off demons is sometimes a little too touchy, and when you are able to power-up your magic, the difficulty gets completely lop-sided. Think you're about to be overwhelmed by demons? Light up the screen with a little magic and the rest of the mission is smooth-sailing.    In addition to the main campaign, Constantine also offers an Arena Mode where you are sent back into the game's environments, such as a nasty trip to Hell, and must blast back as many demons as possible. This is a promising extra that some fans may get some good mileage out of, but after a while, the Arena starts getting a little repetitive.   The average-ness of the action is unfortunate, because the game's plotting and productions values really are quite good. Constantine's dialogue writer nails the disaffected distance of the character. There is a little portrait of the title character at the bottom of the screen that looks close enough to Keanu Reeves without having to pay likeness rights. During play, this portrait will blink and look around. The environments are very recognizable for people who have seen the movie. The nightclub and Hell in particular are very representative of the source material. Constantine has some good music during the title and menu screens, but the in-game effects are pretty limited.  Constantine is an average game. The basic game play elements, the shooting and holy water bombing of demons is a little touchy and the magic really tips the scales in your favor more than it should. But the exorcizing is cool and some of the puzzle elements are good. And the production values are excellent -- Warner Bros. really dialed in the movie with this one. Even though it doesn't follow the plot, it has enough hooks into the movie universe (which is definitely a little off from the graphic novels) to grab fan attention. It's just that as soon as they enter Constantine's universe, after a couple levels of basic action, they may start looking for the closest exit.", "date": "May 14, 2005"}
