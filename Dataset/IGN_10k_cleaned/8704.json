It must be Wednesday at IGN AU because another World War II shooter has just been delivered by the video gaming stork, ready to be added to the bulging pile that is starting to block the office's sole fire escape, causing an OH&S concern.   Hour of Victory was the handle that developer nFusion thought to call this game. Having had our way, we would've named it 'Call of the Finest Assault Command of Duty: Allied Arms Victory 3', because Hour of Victory is an incredibly generic amalgam of great titles, stitched together like a wounded solder by an amateur medic on the great and bloody battlefield that is game development.   So what's wrong with Hour of Victory? Outside of a good number of small issues, not a lot. Hour of Victory treads carefully inside the boundaries at all times. Even introducing three characters to the narrative - each with their own specialisations and weaknesses - adds virtually nothing to what is a formulaic WWII shooting experience from the get-go.   Hats off to nFusion for attempting to one-up Call of Duty in the gameplay-variety department; unfortunately, Midway's attempt was roundly unsuccessful. The three character-class system holds a lot of potential for variety and replayability - on one hand, you can choose from 'commando' (Rambo), 'ranger' (sniping) or 'covert' (stealth-'em-up) classes. On the other, choosing any class other than Commando puts you at an immediate and noticeable disadvantage.    The Commando class character (called Ross - now there's a hard-edged name if I ever heard one) gets a greater resistance to bullets and, importantly, starts off with an M1A1 sub-machinegun and a potent Webley repeating revolver. Instantly, this character is a tank and a damage-absorbing beast of a soldier that actually makes the game easier to play.   Return to Castle Wolfenstein? Nope. Call of Duty? Nope. It's Hour of Victory. Generic-much?   The result? The other two classes are underpowered by comparison - the Ranger starts off with a sniper rifle (no grenades, either) and can jump farther. Umm, yay? As for the Covert character, he gets a silenced Sten Mk2 and a survival knife, can pick locks and cut fences.    So far, it doesn't sound too bad, does it? Well, we'd agree with you, if the developer put more thought into the level design. A token effort was made, sure - each campaign level contains various points where the path diverts slightly depending on the abilities of the player-character's class. For instance, the Commando can push heavy objects from his path, the sniper can scale ropes and the covert agent can prune fences to get around obstacles.   However, the effect on the game is effectively nil. Occasionally, you're rewarded with a weapon or ammunition, but that's it. Tactically, there's some advantage to the sniper staying out of harm's way, but even levels clearly designed for one character in particular (such as the sewers - designed for the covert agent) quickly dissolve into one messy fire-fight after another.   Other moments, such as taking over anti-aircraft guns, tanks and other vehicles, all feel like they've been pulled directly out of Call of Duty and Medal of Honour - except, those two series managed to do a better job.   Ever critical in a shooter, regardless of genre, the AI in Hour of Victory is pretty shallow. The Nazi menace knows how to hide behind cover, shoot, flank and retreat. However, their field of vision is average, and apparently they're mostly deaf, because you can rattle off gunfire in one room, and an enemy in an adjacent room will continue to twiddle his Nazi fingers while whistling a Nazi tune and presumably dancing a dainty Nazi jig.   You're occasionally joined by AI allies who don't do a lot else beyond absorb fire. When they do occasionally get proactive, it's usually too little, too late. They don't seem to think much about tactics themselves; instead, they tend to just stand in the open, fire off a full clip and run away.   What the AI lacks, it makes up for in numbers and chaos. Getting stuck into a gun fight with 6 or 7 opposing troops can spell a quick demise for any character that isn't a Commando. To avoid being overwhelmed, we found ourselves taking advantage of line-of-sight exploits and numerous pathing issues that saw enemy soldiers getting stuck inside crates, in corners and amusingly, behind each other.   Sadly, the game looks better in still screens than it does in-game.  Hour of Victory is running on Unreal Engine 3.0, which is surprising, since the game doesn't actually look all that impressive. For every properly bump-mapped surface and high resolution texture, there is a shockingly cruddy texture applied to incidental objects like crates and clotheslines. They're so obviously half-cocked, they'd be placeholder textures last generation.   Coupled with a chuggy framerate, and no environmental physics and very little interactivity, Hour of Victory is disappointingly last-gen - who would've thought that Unreal Engine 3.0 could churn out this kind of mediocrity?   Most elements in Hour of Victory cater specifically to the eager and desperate WWII shooter fan that has been raised on a steady diet of Call of Duty gameplay staples. Even basic details, such as the star-objective indicator on the compass or the style of the focussed-aiming on rifles and pistols, have been taken from Call of Duty. Multiplayer modes are included, but honestly, it's another token inclusion - it won't be stealing you away for too long.   There are precious few surprises; the occasional scripted event, the moderately well-acted cut scenes, the rousing strings-section score - all of it - has been done somewhere else, and it's all been approached in the same way. Even the dialogue is starting to sound recycled.    There are only so many ways you can tell the same story, after all. World War II shooter fans have used all of these guns before, stormed these castles and flattened these villages. They've ventilated countless Nazis and oppressive leaders. They've thwarted secret experiments, freed scientists, manned tanks, blown stuff up with potato-mashers and watched as the screen has gone red and veiny as they themselves have been punctured and violated with lead.    Hour of Victory is completely playable and offers disposable action and cheap thrills, but it's also completely unremarkable. It never stands on its own feet or adds to the genre in any significant way. Instead, it's just another resounding thumper of a coffin nail, pointing to the retirement and eventual death of the WWII shooter.", "date": "Jun 27, 2007"}
