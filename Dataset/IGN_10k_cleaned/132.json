George play new simple game call Blastdown. Simple game have simple controls and simple colors for simple fun. George still playing. Even as George type this. George multi-talented.   I was going to do the entire review like that but Microsoft Word's grammar check feature would have lit up my document like a Christmas tree. Not that it doesn't already, but, you know, more so than usual.   EA gives wireless gamers its take on this simple, addicting and challenging block game. The goal is easy. Click the same colored blocks to make them disappear. Clear the board and start all over. There are two modes, Speed and Marathon. Both the same, but both with their own unique way of stressing you out.   In Speed mode you have to achieve a certain number of points in the time allotted. Reach that goal, and a new point goal appears. Reach that point total and it keep increasing and increasing until you realize you will never ever be a master at this game. Until you play it again three minutes later with renewed vigor and confidence. Clear a board with no blocks left and get bonus points. So how do you play it? Do you click like a madman and hope for the best? Or try and strategize to get the maximum points possible while sacrificing precious seconds?   Marathon is the same game, but there is no time limit. Instead you have health points. Every single block you leave behind will subtract from your total health until you reach zero and the game is over. Clear a board with no blocks remaining and get bonus points just like in Speed mode. You can take your time with this one, but it's tough. Luckily, this mode gives you three Wild blocks you can use to replace a colored block. Every 10,000 points earns you a bonus Wild block.   You do have some power ups to assist you. I would have liked more, like bonus time or some health points, but whatever. I'll take what I can get. Multiplier blocks increase your score by that number. Lightning blocks not only clear the group you've picked, but also expand the area by one block each. Bombs are useful as well but I found they only appeared in Speed mode.   The graphics are like the game. Simple and colorful. The music was actually pleasant and not distracting. For once I left the music alone in a game. Controls are simple as well. Use the directional pad to move your cursor and the center or OK button to make your blocks disappear and go to block heaven. I recommend you play this game on a cell phone with a good control pad. I don't like the flat pad on the LG phone I used to try out the game. I kept either hitting the center button, the exit button or the pause button by accident.Im a sucker for fun addicting games and Blastdown! has both categories covered. Its a great little pick me up when in your in line at the grocery store and they dont have any Archie Double Digests for you to read. Its worth the purchase because youll always come back to it to try and top your previous score. And thats what makes a game fun to play.", "date": "Apr 4, 2008"}
