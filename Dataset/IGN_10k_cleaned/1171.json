Sure, Last Call was charming in its own way, and any game where you can learn to mix a proper drink holds a special place in the hearts of the IGN editors.  And then there was Panty Raider: From Here to Immaturity.  Shudder...let us never speak of it again.  The latest offering from Simon & Schuster and Hypnotix, Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire (WWTBUAM), is another in a long line of semi-humorous yet often mind-boggling mediocre games that remind us that good game design may be a little more involved than some people think.    As you can tell from the name, WWTBUAM is a parody of the hit television show and best-selling game Who Wants to be a Millionaire?.  Like Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, WWTBUAM will test your mastery of trivia with 750 questions.  But instead of rising through the financial ranks until you reach a cool million, if you answer a question correctly you get to beat as much cash as you can out of one of the five millionaires in the game.  Each millionaire has ten tiers of health.  The more punches you land, the more health you sap from that millionaire, and the more money you get in return.  You'll also pick up special weapons like keyboards and fraternity paddles later in the game that will do even more damage than your fists, thereby giving you more payola in less time.    It may sound like an interesting, albeit sadistic, twist on the popular game show.  Unfortunately, the beat down portion of the game makes WWTBUAM little more than a third-rate boxing game with some trivia thrown in...and in this boxing game, your opponents don't even fight back.  While the cartoonish graphics in the game are colorful and, for the most part, look nice, the animation is so jerky you'll think you're in a Herbie Hancock video.  The game also has a horrible tendency to hang between sequences, causing the last syllable from your ever-annoying host Egregious Phillin to repeat four or five times until the next sequence is loaded.  It's got the feel of a Shockwave game, which wouldn't be so bad if you were playing the game for free on the Internet.  But at $20, WWTBUAM just doesn't cut it as a full title.    As simple as the game may be, WWTBUAM's biggest downfall is its lack of replayability.  Sure, the 750 questions afford you plenty of plays before you start seeing repeats, but the game's novelty wears off really quickly.  Plus the questions are unfathomably easier than the real Millionaire games, so you'll shoot through them much faster.  Multiplay with up to three others adds a little bit to the game, but the experience still gets old after just a few games.  How many times can you play a mediocre, jerky boxing game before you just get bored?  For me it took about five times before I was ready to put this one away forever.    So, is there anything good about WWTBUAM?  Well, not really.  Trivia fans are going to find it too easy, and boxing fans are going to find it too limited.  With a price tag around $20, the game may seem cheap when compared to other titles, but you just don't get much bang for your buck.  There's just not much here, and the novelty wears off too quickly.  Go see a few movies instead...you'll have more fun.    -- Tal Blevins   Comment on this story", "date": "Aug 16, 2000"}
