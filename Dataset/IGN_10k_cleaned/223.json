On the one hand, I adore the characters of Pen Pen Triicelon, and I think the game itself is fresh, original, and fun, in both single and multi-player mode.  On the other hand, I'm not sure I can recommend that everyone out there purchase a game that took me three hours of play time in order to see just about everything worthy of being seen. Overall, some will enjoy Pen Pen for it's original gameplay and awesome characters, but people looking for a game that will last a reasonable amount of time, should look elsewher on 9/9/99.            It turns out that Pen Pen Triicelon is, at its heart, a good game.  Ignoring the characters for just a moment (although, it must be said that it pains me greatly to do so), the game's most notable aspect is the unique way in which it organizes its races.  Each race consists of three different events: belly sliding, swimming, and speed walking.  These events are done on separate sections of the course, one after the other, with a brief break in between as your character walks from one event to the next.  There's also an expert racing mode of sorts in which one of the three events will be repeated over a brand new section of the course.  I'm not sure if I can remember a game that's implemented anything like this before; it's a unique idea that actually works well, and I'm hoping to see it in future titles.              Control during each phase of the race is simple, well-implemented, and functional, with just a few areas of frustration. The swimming and belly-sliding events require you to press the A button in order to make your character stroke itself forward.  Timing is important, as the key to the greatest speed is to follow the strokes with a long glide, before you press the A button again to stroke.  It's sorta like doing the breast stroke in swimming.  For the novice, the game has a handy dandy onscreen display that suggests when you should press and let go of the A button.  In the speed-walking section, you control your forward movement using the analogue pad.  You can charge at an opponent, stunning him for a moment if you should strike him, but if you miss, you'll be the one who's stunned for a moment.  One of the game's problems appears here, as when the characters have been struck, they remain stunned for far too long.  It gets quite frustrating.   The best part of the game, and this is the moment I've been waiting for, would have to be its characters.  Boy do I love the little Pen Pens!  Rarely have such a wacky band of toons been assembled into one game.  Pen Pen means Penguin in Japanese, but the crazy critters of Pen Pen Triicelon hail from a wide variety of species, and are full of personality, unique characteristics, and a few additional surprises.  Watching these guys perform is tremendous fun.  The character models spare no expense in the polygon department, so they look more like they're pre-rendered than being rendered on the fly by your Dreamcast, and the development team Land Ho has done a good job in instilling the characters with the wackiest levels animation.   You'd have to have had the hardest upbringing to not show at least a tiny grin when you first see the characters waddle their way forward.  Sparky, my favorite, seems to be the most general character  he glides on his belly at the perfect speed for my liking, and he's also pretty good at walking and swimming.  The shark character is no good at belly sliding, but he can swim the fastest.  Each character comes equipped with cute little phrases that they shout out as they pass an opponent (my favorite would have to be Sparky's ~Cha Cha Cha~).  Someone out there ought to sign these Pen Pens up for a multi-year, multi-million dollar stuffed animal contract; I'd be the first in line!  The cute characters, simple controls, and unique course design add up to a fun experience  and not just for odd-ball adults like myself.  Little kids too will no doubt love the antics of the Pen Pens, and will find the controls a breeze.  The game also features a four-player split-screen mode which suffers little if any loss in the graphics department.  I had a ball racing against my friends over a single event (you can select to race only one event, as opposed to racing a whole triathelon).  Racing a whole event against your friends can be somewhat of a bore, though, as the races become too long.      When considering only these things, Pen Pen may seem like a definite purchase, with only a few flaws.  Most people, however, take another aspect of a game into consideration when deciding upon a purchase: replay value.  Pen Pen comes up short in this area, primarily due to there being only four full courses to race on.  It's true that racing on harder versions of the tracks will add obstacles here and there, but this feature seems to be somewhat limited, and further points to the fact that the game desperately needs three or four more courses.  It seems that in order to alleviate the lack of courses, the game's developers have created a gift system in which you are awarded with gifts for finishing first on the courses.  These gifts come in the form of forty-or-so dress-up items which can be worn by your Pen Pen as it races.  It's unfortunate that these items are purely for show, and don't serve to alter the races in any way, although the idea of having the little Pen Pens using their toy machine-gun to actually blow away their opponents probably wouldn't fly too well with the ESRB people.  I have a feeling that a lot of gamers are going to ignore this feature once they realize that the new items do nothing to affect the racers.  Gee . . . this is my first review EVER of a game, and I find myself freaking out over the fact that I can't say for sure whether or not you should make the purchase.  You're going to have to make the call on this one.  If you like the characters, find yourself intrigued by the play mechanics I've described above, and you're interested in getting some four player simultaneous action going on launch day, take solace in the fact that the controls in Pen Pen Triicelon are solid, and place it on your list of possible buys.  For me, the game's just too short to warrant a full price purchase.  I'll wait until the price comes down to under twenty, and then add it to my collection, right next to all the other wacky games I buy.  -- Anoop Gantayat, who likes to slide through the IGN offices on his belly, just to please the chicks.", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
