She's had two Game Boy Advance games and two Game Boy Color games released in Europe. Each has been a simple, enjoyable platformer with cute characters and easily-navigable environments. Enter Jerry Seinfeld's animated Bee Movie, a film Majesco obviously means to cash in on by releasing Maya's first Nintendo DS adventure in the states under the title The Bee Game. Unfortunately, young fans of that film will probably be upset when their confused parents pick up this game instead of the official Bee Movie DS game. Fortunately, The Bee Game is a pretty solid adventure, at least for very young gamers.    Players control either Maya, the heroine of the series, or Willi, Maya's pal. Both are functionally identical and can run, crawl, hop and hover their way through plant and dirt in search of each level's oversized flower. What's nice about the game is that it's tailored for younger gamers. This may seem pretty common on the DS, but the majority of licensed kiddy games have too many adult sensibilities to be fully enjoyed by the under-seven crowd: too many long pits, too many fast enemies. Like Nintendo's own Super Princess Peach on the DS, The Bee Game never gets too complicated or clever in its game mechanics and level design to frustrate its target audience. Each level is a leisurely stroll, helping Maya search out flowers, clovers and various other garden-themed collectibles.    Maya can hover-jump ala Yoshi, although this ability is limited to only a few seconds per jump, and drains from a jar of honey at the bottom of the screen. Maya can refill her jar by bouncing on medium-sized flowers placed throughout each level, expelling collectible balls of pollen. Each flower has an infinite amount of pollen and there's never a critical hover-jump that doesn't have a flower nearby. Given the simplicity of the rest of the game, it might have worked better to allow Maya to hover without the honey jar. Imagine Yoshi's Island if Yoshi ran out of his hover ability every thirty seconds. Still this gameplay mechanic is simple and should be easy for young gamers to acclimate to.    The enemies are perfect for a platformer aimed at young kids. They move in slow, predictable patterns, generally take only one hit each and pose little threat to the player. Their collision detection is pretty forgiving, allowing Maya to hop on them from an angle instead of just top down. The only odd thing is that Maya's enemies are happy little bugs that look like they should be her friends. The player is never set up with any story so we're unsure why Maya and these dozens of cheerful insects are enemies.    The level design is very smart in this game. Although it gets a bit tougher as the game progresses, the initial levels in particular are perfect for young gamers on their first platformer. Because of the screen layout, blind jumps occur frequently, but there are so few floor hazards in the game that leaps of faith are never hazardous. The player can also scroll the screen vertically with the L and R buttons. Although there are many areas that require Maya to hover, few require a full hover and there are no toenail jumps in the game (ones that require pixel-precise takeoffs). With such a limited amount of level art, the environments tend to get a little repetitive, and I noticed several spots where lazy tile placement left huge areas black and empty. But in terms of functionality, these levels are exactly what they needed to be for the target audience.    Every so often, the game will be broken up by a flying level, where the player pilots Maya around with the D-pad while the screen auto-scrolls. These are a nice change of pace and, like the rest of the game, are relatively easy to pass. There is one major design flaw in this section, however; although getting caught behind a rock and pushed offscreen forces the player to restart the level, so does voluntarily flying off the left of the screen. The developers should have prevented Maya from exiting the left of the screen without being pushed by an object, especially since that's how it works with the other three screen edges. As it is now, younger gamers that enjoy flying her around might not understand why they have to restart a level without having touched an enemy or getting squashed.    The game offers three stylus-based minigames as well, two of which are playable and unlockable through the main game. These are designed around very simple game mechanics in which the player moves Maya around to throw, catch or slingshot objects from one screen to another. The first game requires turning the DS sideways (ala Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword), which works well with the pollen-lobbing play mechanic. Unfortunately all three games are lacking in art direction, combining lush backgrounds with ugly, scaled-up pixel art. They also kick the player out to the title screen upon completion without any fanfare or congratulations.    Through the course of the game, icons of Maya's friends can be unlocked. These portraits presumably show up in the Friends section, accessed from the title screen. I say presumably because unfortunately our retail copy of the game (whether due to a programming flaw or a defect in our specific cart) never saved progress, something I didn't discover until quitting out of the main game an hour in to find all save files still at 0%. According to the instruction manual, ~after each successfully completed level the progress will be automatically saved.~ Because it wasn't, and because there is no option for manual saving in the game, buyers should proceed with caution. That said, even if this is a flaw that exists in all carts, gamers young enough to enjoy Maya's adventures might not mind replaying the first few levels each time they pick up the game.    There's also a coloring book section where the player can color over six black and white images of Maya and her pals. The painting works very well, although this mode lacks the depth of a game like Drawn to Life, with a limited palette, no zoom and no paint bucket. Still, young kids should enjoy doodling in this section once they've tired of the main game.The Bee Game is an enjoyable platformer genuinely aimed at younger kids. It should hold no interesting for anyone old enough to play Pokmon, but for very young gamers its a great place to start. It offers most of the standard hop and bop mechanics, without focusing on gameplay elements that would be too difficult for its target audience.", "date": "Nov 6, 2007"}
