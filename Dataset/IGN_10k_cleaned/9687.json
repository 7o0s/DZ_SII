Many moons ago, Interplay released their impressive (for the time) Virtual Pool, which featured very realistic ball physics and a good variety of different games to choose from. Their follow up title, Virtual Snooker gave US players a chance to learn a load of typically British games that they may not have had that much experience with. Most recently, the same company released a true sequel to their Virtual Pool, Virtual Pool 2, which offered up a load of new AI opponents and some cool new trick shots. While the physics on all three of these games was top notch, the presentation left a great deal to be desired. Your opponents and the tables you played on all looked and felt pretty much the same. Without any real goals, other than trying to win a game, owning each of these titles is a lot like having a real pool table in your house  after a while it gets pretty dull unless you have a friend over to compete against. Now THQ has stepped in to offer up a little competition to Interplay's billiards dynasty, Ultimate 8 Ball. While it's not perfect, this quirky little pool title delivers more atmosphere and long-term challenges than anything that's hit the shelves before.  Let's start with the basics. Ultimate 8 Ball boasts 14 different games  Eight Ball, Nine Ball, Cut Throat, Rotation, Speed Pool, Ten Pin, Killer, Straight Pool, Bank Pool, One Pocket Ten Ball, Three Ball, Six Ball and UK Rules Eight Ball. While this is certainly a sweet line-up, it's also gotten to be pretty much standard  no real points scored here. What's a lot more impressive is the game's 15 different tables. In addition to the standard 8 foot table, there's a tourney table, a dogleg table and several other bizarre surprises. Better still, there are several different surfaces available for many of these tables, from an abused swampy table that crazy slow, through standard well cared for tables to tables made of glass (warning  every shot should be very gentle), there's plenty of different options available to you that will consistently challenge even the most experienced shark.  Another thing that really nice about Ultimate 8 Ball is that there's a point to the whole thing above and beyond your standard win-the-virtual-tourney-and-take-home-fake-dough. In addition to single play and tourney modes, Ultimate 8 Ball boasts a Hustle game that lets you take on the different AI personalities and work your way to the top of the heap. As you beat each player you'll unlock their AI and locations for single player mode and earn yourself another potential opponent. If you make it to the end you get to play a really hot pool player for some seriously high stakes. Winning the hustle is all kinds of hard as you must play on the table associated with your opponent. I was dynamite on standard felt, but it took me quite a while to master glass tables well enough to beat their guardians.  Each of these different tables is much more than just a set of physics rules and some flashy graphics, it's an environment. The aforementioned slow table is in a place called the Swamp Shack and is stacked up on a bunch of old barrels  it makes since that it's slow. Other locations offered are a techno club, a casino, a diner, and a retro club, each with tables that make sense for the location. Even more impressive is that each of these locations looks great and boasts its own theme music that adds to the overall feel. After a few games, you really start to favor different locations and different opponents which makes the whole experience much more realistic overall.  Ultimate 8 Ball is a long way from perfect though. I found the break physics to be seriously wonky, and well over half of the breaks in the various games I played ended up as fouls  even when the computer was shooting. I also found the cue control to be overly sensitive which really hurts when you're trying to deliver those delicate taps. The control interface looks like it was designed by a console team and often requires more clicks and movement than it seems like you should have to make for basic actions. Finally, since there had to be graphics for each one, there are a lot fewer AI opponents available in this title than you would find in Virtual Pool 2. Still, with the possible exception of the break problem, none of these issues really bugged me that much in the long run.  If you like video pool, you really owe it to yourself to give this game a go. While it may not be as hard-core technically correct as Virtual Pool in a vacuum, the game's different felt speeds and unique opponents really make it feel like you're playing pool in the real world. If you've never tried out a pool game before, this is a pretty good title to start with. Not only does it have helpful tutorials that actually have you make the shot yourself to ensure that you're getting it right, but it also has a trick shot mode that can hone your potting skills to a razor's edge.  -- Trent C.
