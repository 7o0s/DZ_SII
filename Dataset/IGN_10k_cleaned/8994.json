Seven hundred fifty three thousand four hundred and nineteen minus six hundred forty five thousand eight hundred and eleven. You know, the basics. In the very first wave of launch titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System, way back in October of 1985, there was one game the Big N could point to as intellectually redeeming. One game that was the flagship of the NES Education Series, and the only edutainment title in the entire lineup: Donkey Kong Jr. Math.   It was Nintendo's earliest series spin-off title, taking an established brand known from the arcade scene -- Donkey Kong -- and using its characters in a different context. Unfortunately, like many of the spin-offs to follow in the two decades afterward, this first attempt fell flat. Making Donkey Kong a math teacher and Junior his student ended up being just about as fun as sitting through school itself.   The first console edutainment game? The instruction in arithmetic here is not too advanced. Basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division problems are what you'll find in the game's main single-player mode, and the two-player competition is even easier (the six-digit subtraction equation used as an example above is as complex as it comes). And limited content isn't helped at all by stiff, cumbersome and confusing controls, which you'll find in both gameplay modes.   You'll control Donkey Kong Junior as he climbs chains in the Operators Mode, with his vertical position on each corresponding to one digit of the answer to the current equation. If you need to enter in a 9, for example, you'll have to have Junior climb all the way to the top. A zero will register if he hangs from the very bottom, and 1 through 8 are all dispersed in-between. Good luck getting each numeral right without making a mistake -- just controlling the young Kong is harder than figuring out the proper total to input.   Calculate Mode is just as wooden, but is presented in a more interesting way. Two players face off against one another, one playing as Junior and the other a pink-colored clone. It's a race to be the first to reach a target sum, held aloft on a placard above DK's head. Getting to a target like +36 could be achieved in several different ways, like jumping to grab a 6, then a multiplication sign, and then another 6. But you could be thwarted by the other player having the same idea, and be forced to use several different digits and operators to come to the final goal.   The ponderous pace of Junior's walking, leaping and climbing could be forgiven in the first Donkey Kong Junior, because there it continued the evolution of platforming that would eventually lead to Super Mario Bros., and there was an end goal and story. There's just not anything as remotely compelling in this Math class title, even when two players do manage to sit down and play it as it is intended. Additionally, there's no AI to control your opponent if you can't find a friend, either, so P2 will just sit there grinning all the while if you set to calculating by your lonesome.Donkey Kong Jr. Math, by itself, comprised the entire NES Education Series. Educational gaming has gotten a boost in recent years, courtesy of the very same Nintendo, will titles like Brain Age and Big Brain Academy. But the Big N's first attempt at edutainment just didn't make the grade. Save yourself a headache and don't grab this dismal Donkey Kong affair -- it's not worth subtracting the money from your wallet.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
