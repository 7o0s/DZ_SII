Anyone who thinks this is fun doesn't get out much. Basically, here are some more missions for the first game, although you don't need the original to play. But as an added bonus, you get to pay full retail.  The artists over on Warcraft III will get a good chuckle out of this one. The dated 2D sprites are fuzzier than year-old strawberries and your heroes' penchant for wearing orange capes calls to mind such epic outings as Deer Hunter and Don't Shoot the Guy in the Safety-Orange Vest. The cut-scenes are similarly indistinct, but on the other hand, if you're still gaming on a Pentium 166 then, bless you Tiny Tim, here's a game that might actually run on your crotchety old system.  Gameplay is almost comically rote. You ~customize~ a hero by choosing a Male Warrior, a Female Warrior, a Male Mage, or (surprise, surprise) a Female Mage. You then modestly tweak their stats (having no discernable effect on the ultimate outcome) and then give them a name. Welcome to Roleplaying Lite.  You are then dropped into a well-nigh incomprehensible background milieu. The swords-and-sorcery fantasy world is explained in a most cursory manner, reminiscent of some old TSR hack-and-slash module like ~The Keep on the Borderlands~, but the explanatory text is even more confused, since it's translated from Russian. Obviously the Eastern Bloc has some catching up to do when it comes to the rarified art of fantasy world-building, because this is a hopelessly cliched mish-mash more geared to inducing chuckles than awe. And I like the Tolkien-type stuff.  But game we must. From the intro, we learn we are in an ~Allod~. An ~Allod~ seems to be a pair of 2D map screens, one representing a town with three hotspots -- tavern, shop, and gate -- and one representing an overland region.  You are by default a noble, heroic type. You start in the ~Allod~ and really, the only place to go is the tavern. Click on a person in the tavern. Listen to their tale of woe. They will talk about the necromancers, orcs, or squirrels that have over-run their village, kidnapped their first-born, and scrambled their wits. It is presumed you will help them, so saddle up adventurers. And if by bad luck or malice you click on the same tavern-dweller again, you are forced, as in the most primitive of adventure games, to listen to their entire, multi-screened spiel once again. The poorly worded text and homemade English voice-overs only add to an aura of unintended parody.  Having no choice but to accept these quests, you set off through the gate into the main game itself. Essentially, you control one or more heroes and frequently some hireling mercenaries in an overhead, strictly grid-based 2D perspective. It's all real-time though, and that's the only real challenge -- mindless creature after mindless creature is thrown at you in a desperate, last ditch effort to hold your attention.  Thankfully you can group units ala Command & Conquer with a CTRL+NUMBER keystroke, so you do have some modicum of control over your units. You have your basic dichotomy between magic and steel, as well as hand-to-hand or ranged attacks. Playwise, though, the distinctions hardly seem to matter -- just throw everybody into the melee and hope for the best. Real-time makes a farce of the round-by-round decisions of classic roleplaying combat, yet this game tries to err more towards the character-oriented, inventory-laden combat of old school RPGs rather than the army-oriented melees of a Warcraft II. No can do.  Once a battle is complete, you are confronted with the laughably painstaking task of gathering loot. For starters, you have to unselect your combat group and pick just one character. This one character must stand exactly over the treasure bag to pick it up. Fortunately, your characters are equipped with invisible portable holes, because hauling off a dozen axes, plate armor vests, and 40,000 pieces of gold has no affect on their movement rate. ~Begone Encumbrance! You are not needed in the world of Roleplaying Lite!~ You can truck off all this loot to an Allod Shop and trade it in for some nicely rendered and suitably diverse mithril helmets and fireball scrolls.  On the flip side, there are a few clever design decisions worth pointing out. The terrain is interesting and varied, and the individual mission maps are hand-built, detailed, logical (apart from a whimsical sense of scale) and diverse. This alone makes the game far more tolerable than one might expect.  But most importantly, Rage of Mages II solves one of the real-time strategy genre's most glaring problems: pathfinding. In most RTS games, convoluted terrain maps and an ant-like AI result in a sort of towering Babylon of angst, as your armies simply cannot and will not move where you direct them to move, instead getting traffic jammed around rocks, trees, and especially, especially bridges. This game remedies that quagmire by the simple expedient of making almost all terrain obstacles -- namely trees, rocks and the like -- passable by individual units, the only penalty being it takes longer for units to wend their way through stump and stone than open field or gravel road. So in a sense the game maps are almost completely open fields as far as the AI is concerned, and by loosely vectoring your groups through the clearest terrain, movement is gloriously and beautifully expedited. And bridges are wide enough for several units to cross at the same time! Who'd have thunk it! So please, for the sake of the children, let these innovations be widely copied.  Another nice touch is a setting that makes your spellcasters automatically choose to cast healing spells on fellow party-members. Since the industry's newfound love affair with the RPG Lite design has reduced the classic roleplaying game cleric to little more than a mobile, ever-ready health-pack, you might as well automate the tedious and boring task of healing your units. It sure beats the potion juggling of a Diablo.  But apart from these few dashes of light, the rest of Rage of Mages II is undifferentiated, insipid, mechanical darkness. No sense of story is ever established, no identification with your characters ever takes place, no tactical challenge ever arises that requires the least bit of planning -- there's not even a need to exercise the kind of basic memory-muscle skills critical to say a fighting game, a first-person shooter or even a light-gun game. All you ever really do is click on the mouse, and as a result, victory is as empty and as hollow as winning the lottery on Judgement Day. This is just another de-boned real-time RPG, stripped of even the dubious pleasures offered by the old turn-based format: managing mana, hit points and inventory in a paused, round-by-round format.  Bottom line: you fanatical Diablo-style gamers with under-powered systems, weekends to waste, and a healthy masochistic streak might consider this one; the rest of you should pass on it, or at least wait until these raging mages angrily hit the bargain bin.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Oct 15, 1999"}
