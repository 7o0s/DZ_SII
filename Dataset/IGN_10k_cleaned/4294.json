The Sims came along and unseated this legendary title, but it had a long and fruitful reign.  Sequels to that epic adventure included Riven and Myst III: Exile and both sold well.  The latest incarnation, Uru: Ages Beyond Myst, is taking a little different journey with a 3rd person perspective not seen before.  Cyan Worlds is also foraying into the online realm with Uru Live -- which has not quite launched yet.  However, that doesn't matter at this point as Uru is a complete, complex, interesting single player adventure which happens to include a persistent state world that will launch in early 2004 with an open-ended, continuing storyline that D'Ni fans everywhere will love.   Uru starts where many online games start -- character creation.  In Uru, it's very simple; you choose a face, hair, clothing and accessories.  Every part of the face is customizable, allowing for an almost limitless variation of appearances.  But there were two things about customization I felt was lacking.  First, of the skin color choices, the pale colors made the avatar look like it just pulled itself out of a 2-week-old grave.  There are no rosy pale colors to choose from, so choosing tan or darker colors are really the only options, although there are a ton of these shades to choose from.  The second thing I felt could have been given more attention was the limited choices for clothing and hair styles.  While both were completely customizable by color, the styles were relatively limited.    Uru does allow you to change your appearance at any time, so you aren't trapping yourself with a look that you have to live with forever.   The story is one of D'Ni, a story of a darker history than has been relayed in previous games.  Atrus, the main protagonist in the previous games, has now been replaced by his daughter, Yeesha.  The journey taken is one that Yeesha has taken and she is your guide.  Much of the history of the D'Ni is uncovered, including many stories of the kings and how many ages came about.  Social structure, marriage and the rearing of children are also discovered -- and are very interesting.  The end of the single-player game makes reference to choosing sides, leaving open a clear purpose to the multi-player game.     The Myst series has always been about exploration and Uru is no exception.  There are 8 Ages ready for ogling, from the eerily beautiful mushroom world of Teledahn to the stunning garden world of Eder Gira .  One of the ages, Relto, is a personal age.  This age is best described as a hub and contains a hut that has a cabinet to customize your avatar, a bookshelf with an informational book and another bookshelf with linking books (which allow you to teleport to the other Ages), as well as some beautiful scenery outside.  Once you visit an age, a linking book is put on your shelf automatically.  An interesting thing about Relto is that it can be customized by finding Relto pages scattered throughout various ages, from adding a waterfall to changing the exterior of the hut itself.  If I were a wagering woman, I'd bet that part of the online game will include tasks that will end with additional ways to customize your private age.    Puzzles in Uru range from pretty easy and obvious to wildly convoluted and difficult, as would be expected with any Myst game.  There are two basic objectives in each Age, to turn on the power (although this objective is slightly different in one Age) and to find seven journey cloths.  In order to do these things, puzzles must be solved and the Age must be thoroughly explored.  In exploring the Ages, the history of D'Ni is discovered, providing a third objective to the game.  Even though some puzzles are very confusing, persistence will pay off.  Clues are scattered throughout the Ages to solving the puzzles as well, but some require thinking outside the box.    If there is one area of the game where improvement can be made, it is the 3rd person controls.  The camera defaults to 3rd person, something completely new to a Myst game.  The 3rd person controls can be very complicated and switching to 1st person for most the game is the best choice in playing Uru.  It's the way Myst should be played anyway.  There are areas where certain jumps must be made which in 1st person would be very difficult to execute.    There is no ~follow behind~ camera choice.  Sometimes the camera is behind the avatar, sometimes it is in front and, at odd times, it snaps to a top down view.  Once I accidentally ran off a ledge because the camera angle suddenly changed on me and I started running the wrong direction. Load times for switching ages can be a little long, so missing that ledge or falling off it and returning to the personal age because of the camera is annoying at best.     The interface is very easy to learn.  Scrolling to the bottom of the screen gives you the three options outside of the game itself: teleporting back to a private age, viewing the options and quitting the game.  The curser changes to an obvious hot spot when over something that can be manipulated.  Movement can be made with the keyboard or the mouse.  Walking is the default, but changing to the run speed is simple enough.  The keyboard layout is customizable as well.   The 3D graphics are, as to be expected, breathtaking.  When I first stepped out of the elevator in Kadish Tolesa and saw my first glimpse of the wilderness, my heart actually fluttered and the word ~wow~ came out of my mouth.  Animations and movement graphics are equally impressive.  Sound effects, voice acting and background music lend as much to the atmosphere of Uru as the graphics and gameplay do.  In general, this is one great looking and sounding game.    Something completely new to the Myst series is the addition of the online persistent state world component, Uru Live.  Uru Live hasn't launched yet, but it will allow players to continue playing in the D'Ni world with regular updates and a continuing storyline.  At the end of Uru, there is a mention of choosing sides, presumably between Zandi -- whom you meet early on in the single-player -- and the DRC (D'ni Restoration Council).   New ages will be added for players to explore and solve together and the old ages are all available for groups to re-enter.  Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is a complete single player experience, but the addition of an online component could completely change how D'Ni fans have experienced that world.  There will be a monthly fee associated with the Live portion.  Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is probably the best adventure game I've played this year.  The addition of the massively multiplayer environment promises to be very exciting as well.  The graphics are stunning, the sound is beautifully done, the puzzles are what one expects from a Myst game, the story is deep and the lore is massive and interesting.  I really loved this game and I think anyone who picks it up will love it as well, as long as you play it in 1st person.", "date": "Dec 5, 2003"}
