{"name": "Run Like Hell", "name_review": "Run Like Hell", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/09/run-like-hell", "text": "is finally finished and in stores after a very lengthy development cycle. Touting a large list of well-known and veteran Hollywood actors, Digital Mayhem threw everything but the kitchen sink at this sci-fi action-horror game. Unfortunately, the final game still doesn't seem finished or entirely polished.   Run Like Hell takes place sometime in the future, long after mankind has met, fought and befriended quite a few different alien races. Nick Conner is stationed on the Forseti Space Station along with his fiancee, Dr. Samantha Reilly. After a long day of some deep space mining, Nick and his crewmember Dr. Amanda Bethune arrive back at Forseti to find that things aren't quite the same as they left them. An alien race has come aboard and wiped out most of the inhabitants, so now Nick must try to stay alive while rescuing the remaining survivors and attempting to wipe out the mysterious alien race.   Gameplay  While the game is set in the third-person perspective and often changing to a set camera spot, moving around the alien-infested space station is fairly easy, though there are a few spots where the player may have to realign Nick to properly use a ramp or use a vending machine. Aside from general movement, Nick can interact with things like said vending machines, search bodies and drawers, or use things like switches. The vending machines, which advertise a certain real beverage so often it doesn't need mentioning here, give drinks or snacks for replenishing health. A quick press of R3 will use these tasty items and give back some health instantly, so there's no need to pull up the inventory just to grab a quick bite to eat.   Throughout the game the player acquires several weapons with which to inflict pain and suffering upon the alien hordes who have overrun the space station. Players start out with a standard issue rifle and infinite ammunition for it, though unlike in Rambo movies, it still needs reloading when each clip gets emptied. Along the way, the player may also pick up an assault rifle, crossbow, shotgun, pulse rifle, bolt thrower and more. While the later weapons are more powerful than the first weapons, most of the better weapons have a limited amount of ammunition, and as extra ammo is either very hard or impossible to come by, the player will likely stick to the standard rifle until the assault rifle is found.   There are also mod chips that may be combined with weapons in order to make them more powerful. Damage chips will allow the guns to do more damage, burst chips will let the player fire more rounds at once, and clip chips will allow the weapon to hold more rounds in each clip so that reloading is required less often. Some mod chips are weapon-specific, while others can be used with any ballistic weapon, for example.   Run Like Hell takes a reasonable amount of time to finish it, though a large portion of that is due to the insane number of cutscenes. While the cutscenes are plentiful, they are generally well done. Some are pre-rendered and some are in-engine, although the pre-rendered scenes look like they use the same character models from the game, so it's sometimes hard to tell what's in-game and what's pre-rendered. The cutscenes move the story along at a nice pace, without rushing through the story so fast that the player doesn't seem involved in what's happened. Almost all of the action seen in the game is player controlled, so the cutscenes are just used to explain goals or work in dialogue, the later of which there is a metric ton of, though it's generally well written and spoken.   Most of the goals in Run Like Hell boil down to either killing a room full of aliens or getting into a locked room to hit a switch. Most of the locked rooms need a pass code, which is just a four or five button combination, such as X - O - triangle - square. The codes are usually found either on dead bodies or on someone's computer screen, which makes it a simple search-and-find puzzle. Strangely, people in the space station seem to have a habit of writing down a pass code to an important room just as they're about to meet their maker, as the code is sometimes incomplete and a second half will need to be found. It's entirely possible to just guess the entire code if it can't be found, though a bit a patience may be required, depending on luck.   While most of the goals are of the simple find-and-use variety, there are a few places where a bit of thought or planning is necessary. Sometimes items will need to be combined to make use of them, or a user-controlled robot will need to be enlisted in order to lure a large and deadly alien away from a door it's guarding. There are also a few minigames in certain places. The first of these works like Dragon's Lair, where the correct buttons must be pressed when prompted in order to escape from impending doom. Another has the player align moving dots with gaps in broken lines to start a gravitational experiment.   Where the game isn't so great is in its lack of variety and fear. Almost every goal is essentially like the last one and the one before that. A few places break up the pace, but it's mostly just the environments that change. There are only a handful of different types of aliens that Nick encounters, and most are revealed right near the start of the game. After killing Scouts and Cutters for about 10 hours, everything starts feeling tired. The game also seriously lacks in fear, which is the most disappointing part. The aliens aren't nearly as frightening as H.R. Giger's creations, which they resemble quite a bit. There also aren't really any moments that instill a sense of looming fear. Aliens will sometimes pop out of nowhere and surprise you, but after about an hour, every entrance that they make in the game has been seen, and it all becomes expected.     The game is also a bit easy. The abundance of vending machines and random health packs along with the quick and easy to use R3 health boost make the game too easy on the combat side. The only time where the player will likely die is either when fighting something that can kill in one or two hits, or when forgetting to pay attention to the health meter. Otherwise clicking R3 a couple times will fully replenish Nick's health in the middle of a fight, and as there are plenty of vending machines to grab some goodies from, there's no need to be frugal with the R3 button. As the goals are generally of the find-and-use variety, the only place where the game gets ~hard~ is when something may be hidden out of the way and time must be spent checking every nook and cranny.   There are many small things in the game that don't look right and make the game feel rushed, despite its long development process. None of them really affect gameplay, but they're there just the same, and taint the game's overall image a tad. For example, there's a spot where two characters decide to share a drink. One character hands the other a whole lot of nothing, and the other character ~drinks~ nothing. Either the glass was so transparent that it was invisible, or it was overlooked and forgotten about. There's another spot where the same two characters are running from a bunch of critters, and manage to barely get into a room and shut the door behind them. Thinking that the aliens are about to break through at any second, one of the characters decides to bar the door. He then proceeds to walk at the pace of a 70 year old with a walker over to the other side of the room, back again with nothing, and says, ~There.~ Again, none of this actually affects the gameplay, but it makes everything look cheap.   Graphics  Run Like Hell's graphics are a mixed bag. The character models are nicely detailed, with well-defined faces and bodies, although a couple of the ladies look a bit freaky from time to time. The character animation is a bit sketchy, though. Players will go from a standstill into a full run without a full transition animation, so movement doesn't look natural. The game's running animations are also pretty bad, which is either odd or dead-on since the game is called Run Like Hell. The evil aliens don't look as well defined as any of the main character's models do, though they still suffer from some lackluster animation. The rule of thumb for this game is that if any character is going to be speaking in a cut-scene, their model looks nice, and if not, then it's less defined. Most of the game seems designed for cut-scenes first, and gameplay later.   The environments are what stand out in the game. The space station looks very clean and hospitable as the game starts, and slowly over time becomes more and more ravaged as the aliens overrun the joint, though it starts getting a little bland then. There are kitchens, sleeping quarters, and random apartments located at various places to make the station look like people actually lived there and were wiped out when the aliens took over. At points the player moves down to a reactor area, or a fire-infested melting pit, and everything looks as it would if this had been done as a movie instead of a game.   The Forseti Space Station doesn't look quite as good once the aliens take over and they start covering the station in some sort of ooze covering. The texture on this stuff is pretty bad and repeats a bunch. Every once in a while there'll be bodies of the slain hung up in the walls, which breaks up the blandness to it a bit, but the space station doesn't look as graphically impressive as it did before that stuff covered everything.   Some of the texture work is spotty, for both characters and the environment, though overall the art team has done a nice job making everything look detailed and unique. There are a couple places in the environment where textures are either very blurry or ultra-pixilated, but overall everything works well.   The game suffers from slowdown in a few spots, some of which don't matter, and some that do. Near the start while just walking around, the game chugs to a few frames a second in a spot or two, but one part where it really matters is near the end. While in one of the last fights, the game may crawl close to a screeching halt if standing in certain spots, making it hard to dodge while firing off a decent amount of shots before the boss goes off to recharge its health.    Sound  Like the graphics, the sound in Run Like Hell has both its ups and downs. While some of the sound effects are good on their own, they begin to get repetitive. Things like doors and some of the weapons sound full and well done, but start losing their appeal after the exact same sound has been played for the tenth time, not to mention the thousandth. As there are quite a number of rooms and separated areas in the game, and therefore doors to pass through, the sounds of doors opening and closing will start creeping into the deep crevices of your brain and begin to echo in your head as you lay in bed at night. Repeated firing of the rifle will bring about the same madness.   The aliens themselves don't bring much to the table as far as variety of sounds either. The swishing of a Cutter's bladed arm sounds convincing, and their screeching yell is decent the first few times it's heard, but they don't offer much more in the audio department than that. Part of the reason that the aliens aren't very frightening is due to the limited sounds they make.     The game features an impressive cast of voice actors. Lance Henriksen lends his vocal chords to voice Nick Conner, portraying his worn-down and fed-up personality perfectly. Kate Mulgrew, Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown and others flesh out the rest of the cast, who generally do a nice job at giving life to their characters. Some of the lesser characters in the game sound a little stilted and forced in their speech, but they're about par for normal videogame voice acting. One odd thing is that most of the characters that Nick interacts and works with after the invasion are of different alien races, and all of them speak in clear, normal human voices instead of some sort of altered speech or accent. Even a grasshopper-esque alien speaks perfectly clear, even though she talks with some sort of pinchers on her head.   As well done as most of the voice acting is, it's sometimes hard to hear it as the entire audio mix doesn't sound leveled properly. The ever-present doors are about as loud as the weapons, which are all much louder than any of the dialogue. The game seems like it was attempting to go for an aggressive movie-like mix, with a large range between what's quiet and loud, but it doesn't really work here. Unfortunately, the only sound options are for the mix type (surround, stereo or mono) and the overall volume. There's no way to boost the voices or turn down the other effects without affecting everything.   Most of the game's music resembles that of a sci-fi horror flick and works nicely. That is, until some licensed music kicks in. Mostly during boss fights, music from bands like Breaking Benjamin will begin playing and seriously disrupt the feeling of the game. Any tiny amount of tension or fear that the game may have instilled is thrown out the window as soon as these tracks start. It's entirely confusing why these tracks are included in the game, as they have absolutely no place at all.Run Like Hell isn't a terrible game, but it's not a really good one, either. It's too easy to play through to feel like anything was earned, and parts of it look unfinished. The story is pretty decent, especially when compared to most videogames, but the lack of variety in the aliens hurts the game's flow, as almost everything is seen right at the start.The saddest part is that the game just isn't scary at all. There's no originality in how any of the aliens come at you, and there isn't any fear-building tension. When I played through the GameCube remake of Resident Evil, I remembered practically every second of what was going to happen and when, solely because the original game made such an impression and instilled enough fear as I played it that most of the scenes are burned into my brain, filed under ~Classic Videogame Moments.~ This game didn't even come close to doing anything memorable as far as the fear aspect goes.", "date": "Oct 9, 2002"}
