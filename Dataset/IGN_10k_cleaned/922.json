If you have, then you will be familiar with Urban Chaos. (If you haven't, then you're in denial, or you're four years old and in that case you just don't count, yet.) Urban Chaos delivers a decent premise and a respectable star character by unfolding the adventures of an African American female as she learns the ropes of being a rookie Union City police officer.   Gameplay Created by Mucky Foot, Urban Chaos takes you into the under life of crime and turmoil in Union City, a thin guise for life in any big metropolitan area, but an awful lot like New York City. The game is set at the turn of the millennium, and as the introductory video opens up, you see just what kind of dark transition is taking place. Union City is experiencing a phenomenal new wave of violence and crime, and new gangs have sprung up with more power and aggression than ever. As D'arci Stern, you must complete the menial tasks of being a cop, such as tackling petty crimes and such, but in the larger scope of things, you find out that a much bigger set of crimes and conspiracies are coming at you like a freight train. Luckily a vigilante ex-cop comes to your side to ~assist~ you with the larger objectives.   Urban Chaos is a 3D, action-adventure game shown from the third-person perspective. As D'arci, you are quite versatile in fighting, but also in jumping, swinging from drop lines, climbing, and using fire arms and driving vehicles. It consists mostly of running, punching, and climbing, but certain aspects of the game's level design are quite impressive, at least in design. Several RPG aspects pop up here and there, too, a surprising aspect that adds a little subtlety to a straight-forward 3D beat-'em-up.   The game is set up in a way quite like Grand Theft Auto and Driver in the way you pick up objectives. You check in at the police department, and a mission objective is given. As you run out to tackle the job, new objectives are radioed in to add to the list. You can usually complete the main objective to finish the level, but by completing the other ones, you receive extra bonuses. You can use a police car or you can run to tackle your missions, but the best way is to run simply because the driving aspect of the engine is rank, to be it mildly.   Before I delve into the game's many weak points, I would like to point out some of its redeeming qualities. With a lot more polish and some fine tuning in specific areas, Urban Chaos could have been a very good game. The most obvious area needing work is the control, but the story, graphics, CG, and the overall interface could have been improved, too.   Anyway, the bustling living city is totally alive with moving traffic and urbanites walking around, and it's build for full exploration. D'arci can literally travel to almost every square foot, be it buildings, parks, alleyways, or whatnot. Ladders and platforms are build-in everywhere so D'arci can reach some of the tallest buildings. Finding your way around the buildings proves to be one of the most entertaining aspects of the game. Figuring out how to get from one building to another by jumping, climbing, or swinging, turned out to be more puzzle-oriented  -- and fun -- than I suspected.   D'arci is able to walk up to any non-player character and converse in some aspect. Most of the city's inhabitants are incredibly rude, but it's still pleasurable to see just how they will insult you. When they're not throwing insults your way, they say the goofiest things, portraying themselves as stoners, salarymen, and oftentimes over-react to you, by screaming ~Police brutality!~ As for the rest of the dialog in the game, it's actually quite weak.   As for the core of the game -- finding bad guys and beating them up -- Urban Chaos is an OK game. All of the basic stuff is there, and it's remarkably like fighting Force or FF II in that sense. A few cool moves, such as triple kicks, the triple punch, the side kicks, and the drop and slam are a little unique, too. But overall the fighting isn't all that rich, folks, it's standard stuff, and you have seen it time and time again. One of the worst aspects of the game -- one that could have pushed this game into the very good category -- is the driving. Driving a car in this town is like skating with razors on tissue paper. Controlling a car is sheer mayhem, utter craziness, serious urban chaos. If you have never taken drugs or drunken liquor and driven at the same time, then you should try this game.   Graphics Even though this game is meant to look dark and gritty, the gritty look shouldn't translate into bad looking grit and course looking graphics to prove the point. The indistinct graphics and dull character designs are harsh on the eyes. To complicate the matters of fighting, driving, and generally moving around are two problems: the frame rate and the camera angles.   After you slog through the rough graphics you'll notice that the framerate runs at about 20-22 frames per second, contributing directly to the game's sluggish feel and the distinct feeling of delay in every punch, kick and move. As for the camera angles, the biggest problem I encountered is that the camera isn't flexible enough. Round a corner at high speeds and watch the camera take its time to follow. Turn around quickly and see how the player move into the lens of the camera. This is a design choice, in part, but the problem behind this is that you can't see what you're running or jumping into, and it's heavily flawed for that very reason. Try running across the busy street into the camera, and not get hit by cars. It ain't pretty folks.   Sound The sound is weird. The music is a mix of '70s funk and groove and contemporary rock and rave. As for the voices, they range from good voices, such as D'arci's, to just pure comic, i.e. everyone else in the game. The delivery, i.e. the voice-acting is utterly without subtlety and flow. It's stilted and obvious and sounds like first time actors reading on the trial stage for a part in the high school play. Rotten. Mucky Foot and Eidos should be congratulated doing something that nobody else has done in a videogame -- starred an African American woman as the lead character. Hooray, somebody is thinking. She's tough, she's slim, built with muscles, smart, and she can fight as good as any of the guys. As for the game, well, poor D'arci could have found herself a better game to appear in. Urban Chaos takes a lot of elements from other games and cobbles them into a 3D beat-'em-up with limited success. I wouldn't recommend buying this game, but on the other hand, some of the gameplay -- discovering the city by jumping from building to building and getting into gang fights -- is worth checking out. The other weaker aspects -- the frame rates, the camera angles, the graphics, and the generally bad implementation of the fighting -- just don't buttress the core of the game to high levels of pleasure.", "date": "May 4, 2000"}
