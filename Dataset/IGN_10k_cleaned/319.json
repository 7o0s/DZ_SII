In a business dominated by male game players most if not all will have played with such green and tan soldiers as children. Just the nostalgia factor would have generated interest but 3DO has cleverly targeted different genres with its new franchise.  Gameplay Army Men: Sarge's Heroes is not a sequel in the normal sense of the word but more a product line extension. Not only is it the first appearance on the N64, but rather than a top down combat game this is a third person action title. This time, General Plastro and his evil Tan Army have discovered portals that offer passage into the world of humans although neither the Tan nor the Green Army are aware that they are running around in such places as a bathroom or garden. Within this human world, Plastro's men find new weapons such as a magnifying glass. Adding to the troubles for the Green Army is the capture of their best troops, the members of Bravo company. Only Sarge is left and must rescue his comrades and save the day.  Moving back and forth between the reality of the green and tan soldiers' world and the human domain Army Men: Sarge's Heroes looks as if the high design concept was Micro Machines meets GoldenEye.  That's a pretty lofty goal and the fact that the game does not reach it does not diminish the fact that at least the team aimed that high. To often these days, game designs don't even try to scale such heights.  Each game level starts off with details of your mission, usually split into a number of sequential tasks. There are a wide assortment of weapons and ammunition available.  The game mixes up the need for these different weapons so for example it is best to incapacitate a tank by laying mines, but then you finish it off with some hand grenades. It is also possible to take a tank on with a bazooka but you only get one chance before the tank starts paying close attention to your position.  As the game is an on going story of Sarge's attempt to rescue Bravo company it seems strange that you lose all ammunition and weapons at the start of each level other than the base rifle.  This rifle is set to auto target, which is very handy when running towards a concentration of enemies. While there are variations on a theme such as a machine gun, grenade launcher and shot gun by far the most interesting mode is the Sniper mode. Although ammunition is in very short supply for this gun, it is possible to take out a lot of the Tan Army from long distance, maintaining Sarge's overall health bar for times when close combat is really needed. The liberal spreading of health restoration boxes throughout the game allows pretty aggressive tactics as the entire health bar is replenished when you collect one of these boxes.  Ranged weapons, especially the mortar, take a little getting used to and for that the practice range comes in handy. This is a separate mode, and a number of relatively easy tasks teach not only the way to use each gun but also overall character movement maneuvering over a series of platforms and how to operate the occasional lever in the game. The fact that you have to show how to pull a lever shows that the interface decisions regarding this were incorrect. The ~sweet spot~ for standing in the correct place to pull a lever is pretty small and even though it is one button push it can be frustrating as you are trying to escape a level to be cut down just because you didn't stand in the exact correct spot.  The biggest problem in the game revolves around the camera. While normally behind and slightly above the Sarge character  a stereotypical third person view  the camera is lost by any sudden or quick moves by the player character. While the camera eventually catches up, this is particularly annoying when being attacked from out of sight from an enemy that has suddenly appeared. The only realistic tactic is to make sure that you are always armed with the base weapon and when such a situation occurs you blast in all directions as quickly as possible. With luck the auto targeting will guide your bullets to the appropriate target but this is hardly a sterling game mechanic.  Thankfully, 3DO also added a death match multi-player mode -- but it's pretty limited. One strange design decision is the re-spawning of the player character in the same place after it has been destroyed. Therefore if you can successfully defeat your opponent near his own home base it is then possible to run to the re-seeding area just as your opponent reappears and toast him again. An effective strategy, but one that should have been caught in test. The strangely entitled family mode takes place in various locals including a sandcastle. The overall construction of that specific level and the feeling of game play are slightly reminiscent of the multi-player mode in GoldenEye.  Along with the standard walking mode and kneeling for shooting it is also possible to move and fight by crawling. This is pretty cool and sneaking up on a gun emplacement and lobbing grenades while on your stomach is the sort of stuff we used to pretend when playing with toy soldiers in our youth. In fact it would have been nice if this was needed more in the overall game play.  Graphics Graphically the game is a bit of a let down although it can be argued that a sparse and fairly stark landscape is appropriate for a game with toy soldiers. However it would have been nice to have a more detailed landscape and more choices of flora and fauna to hide behind. Obviously this is less so in the human world levels where children's blocks  these kids have far too many with 3, D and O  bathroom cabinets, aerosol cans and the like are represented. The dreaded pop-up is unfortunately quite noticeable and does detract from the overall gameplay experience. Your character, Sarge, is finished in a very nice deep green sheen although the Tan Army is less so. While this may be accurate, as I refer to my distant memory of such toys, it does make the Tan Army enemies difficult to see from a distance. Here the radar comes in handy for letting you know where the opponents are and a quick switch to Sniper mode can do the job. Speaking of the Radar, the graphical presentation of the on screen interface is well thought out in that 3DO kept it simple. There is always a tendency to try and do too much -- but Army Men presents what you need in a pleasant manner.  Each mission ends, and some start, with nice sequences that continue the story. Obviously not Pulitzer level writing but it does the deed and efficiently so.    Sound One area that the game succeeds is in the music department. The main theme is reminiscent of numerous war movies and the level music conveys just the right amount of pacing and tension. Sound cues also help with gameplay where the chattering of an enemy machine gun or the rumble of tank tracks tells you that you are in trouble. Hiding behind a hill after laying a quick mind field it is the sound of an explosion followed by no tank track rumble that tells you that you have done the job and can now finish off the tank with grenades. This is a classic example of an ~it's ok~ game. You know, where your buddy asks ~how was the game?~ and you reply, ~well, it's ok.~  The levels are generally well thought out and the good Sniper mode is off-set by the frustrations with the poor camera implementation and a lack of save points.  There is however an interesting foundation in place and if it can be built upon well then game players will look forward to each new release.
