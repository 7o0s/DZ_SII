The real-life sport is spiraling into farce right now with hearing on five-year-old accounts of steroid use upstaging the actual game. That's not to downplay the problem of juiced professional athletics, because it is a sorry scourge, but sometimes you just want to throw a few  heaters without between-inning discussions on politics.   Here at IGN Wireless, we were excited to throw out the opening pitch with JAMDAT Sports' MLB 2005. The mobile maker has an extremely competent sports division that we think has the potential to stand up against the inevitable onslaught of EA Sports-branded offerings sure to come next year when the behemoth has both feet firmly planted in the wireless world.   MLB 2005 is a fine example of JAMDAT's strengths in the arena. The developer/publisher has a remarkable talent for zeroing in on the essence of a sport and presenting it in bite-sized gaming sessions. Of course, baseball, with its slower-paced play is a natural for wireless. Basketball is a little too frantic for today's breed of handsets, but baseball's give-and-take form really sings on a cellphone, especially when in JAMDAT's capable hands.   MLB 2005 really captures the war between the batter and pitcher. This isn't to say its ignores fielding and baserunnng -- in fact, you actually have control over both of those aspects of the game -- but the fight over strikes and hits is really fun to play.   As a pitcher you have a few pitches you can select by tapping the d-pad in the required direction. Next, you choose where you want to put the ball across the plate. Finally, you must fill a swoosh-like meter, carefully nailing the green zone as it provides the purest pitch. Underpower it and it will be an easy hit. Blast the meter into the red and the pitch may go wild. You must also monitor your pitcher's fatigue. Should your pitcher start getting tired, you better sub or his limp arm will give up easy hits.   As a batter, you just have to hunker down and wait for your pitch. The ball doesn't exactly scream across the plate, but that's a good thing as it allows you a second to judge whether or not the pitch is swing-worthy.   In the field, you must use the d-pad to run for pop flies. The first time we tried the game, we actually didn't bother with trying to field because we were so used to not having to do it. While watching the ball drop in a vacant part of the outfield wasn't good for the score, it was great to see our attention was needed more than in previous baseball games. Throwing the ball is also handled with the d-pad.   One of the reasons MLB 2005 is a hit is because it actually feels a little like a console baseball game. The meters, the fielding, using the d-pad to select pitches -- these are all things found in EA's MVP and SEGA's MLB 2K5. JAMDAT's little game feels like an extension of those great games, a nice little to-go complimentary game for when you cannot park it in front of your Xbox or PC.   MLB 2005 enjoys a full license, including all teams and players. The game offers up quick play, exhibition, and season play for players of various commitment levels.   We test-drove the game on an LG VX7000. MLB 2005 looks fine on its bright screen. The batter is good sized with fluid animation. The fielders are not nearly as detailed, but they are fine for our mobile purposes. The stadium is bright and colorful with freshly mowed grass and a forever sunny day. MLB 2005 also uses digital voice samples to augment the action, such as rubbing it in your face when you strike.MLB 2005 is an excellent baseball game. I've grown extremely weary of simplified home run contests and there is no shortage of them. Baseball fans wanting a full game are better served with JAMDAT Sports MLB 2005 as it offers a complete package. And if it's a small game you want, you can just opt for a brief quick play and turn the phone off when you have to get back to life. JAMDAT has nailed the important essences of the sport and put together a great control scheme that makes MLB 2005 a cinch to really get hooked on. I really cannot recommend this enough for baseball fans. While I haven't played all of the upcoming baseball games for mobile, I can safely say the bar has been set pretty damn high.", "date": "Mar 26, 2005"}
