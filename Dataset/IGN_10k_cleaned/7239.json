The bestselling puzzle game occupies yet another screen, bringing its block-dropping beat to iPods around the world, but does this edition of the classic weave the same spell it does over consoles, PC, and mobile? The short answer: Sorta.   Tetris for iPod certainly looks the part. Anybody familiar with the game will instantly recognize the classic and enjoy its polished look on the exquisite iPod screen. The classic formula has not been tweaked with -- this is regular Tetris with just a few slight game play variations, such as a timed mode called Ultra. But otherwise, nothing has changed... and in the case of Tetris, it never needs to.   However, where Tetris hiccups is the controls -- and this stands to be a major issue with most iPod games. With only one control scheme, you have no choice but to un-learn the way to stack up blocks. Running your finger around the wheel moves the blocks from side to side. Pressing ~back~ and ~next~ rotates the blocks. The central ~select~ button slowly drops the blocks while pressing ~play/pause~ initiates a hard drop. If you've been playing Tetris for a while now -- whether you started on a Mac, the GameBoy, or mobile -- it's quite difficult to reacquaint yourself with the controls. Reversing the rotate and block moving controls would have made a lot more sense. Why wouldn't you rotate the block with the wheel and move it with directional presses?   However, unlike Pac-Man, this is a hurdle you can eventually get around -- it will just take a little time. But hardcore Tetris players may become frustrated with not being able to immediately dig in and wage the good fight against negative space.  Tetris looks and sounds great on the iPod. The music EA attaches to the game is pleasing enough that you may not seek out tunes from your own playlist before hitting the bricks. The control scheme is tricky and takes some time to get used to -- some players may not feel like relearning such a venerable gaming staple. I've logged some solid time on Tetris since Tuesday and have gotten fairly adept at the controls, but I wish they had made different decisions here. Tetris is still a great game, but the barrier between you and it -- courtesy of the controls -- may not be worth the effort.", "date": "Sep 15, 2006"}
