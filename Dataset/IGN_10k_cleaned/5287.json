First there were four Dynasty Warriors games and beginning with Dynaasty Warriors 3 we began to see some spinoffs as well. With the creation of Samurai Warriors Koei took the series to Japan from China, but the genetic code is hardwired into the system and lo and behold we have Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends an expansion pack that's disguised as a whole game. It has some interesting new additions, but to be honest this is one that's truly for the hardcore fans.   Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends brings in four new characters and a few new modes of play as well as some tweaks to the game itself. While it's possible to play through the Story Mode, a set of five scenarios each, this is only an option for the new Legends. As such, this limits the solo gameplay to just four different stories and playing against the computer in the Vs. matches. In other words, this really is an expansion even though the rest of the characters from Samurai Warriors are here for the rest of the festivities.   The new characters are fun to use and provide a little bit of variety (or as much as four can provide, anyway), but it's really just an excuse to bring players back to the world to see the rest of the changes in store for them. One of these new additions is that the Vs. Mode has three challenges: Duel, Sumo, and Gatekeeper. Duel is just what it says it is with two players squaring off against each other, but Sumo is a more interesting take. Players choose one of the heavier warriors in the game and attempt to force appearing soldiers out of a ring. The one who gets the most knocked out wins. Gatekeeper is a similar battle with each player defending a gate from hordes of soldies who are trying to get through.    These new Vs. modes are a bit of fun to play and would normally be a sideshow to the main event, but since the main event has been chopped to a sliver of its former self the rest of the focus here is on the fine-tuning that's been going on. Developer Omega Force has been making these games from the beginning and so Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends really represents the latest ideas that have been bubbling up. Again, this is good news for the hardcore fans, but not something that new players should be getting into first.   In Samurai Warriors the characters improved their stats as they got up to level 20 and then they were entombed in amber. This time around the stats can keep improving and become truly terrifying. The same approach has been taken with the weapon system as well. There are now sixth level weapons and the weapons themselves can be improved by paying a blacksmith or purchasing other items. There are also nine new skills and six new skill items to play around with that help to flesh out the rest of the gameplay.   Of course, this wouldn't be an expansion disc without the ability to swap in characters from Samurai Legends and beef them up here. There is a fair amount of disc-swapping involved in the process, but as a whole it's worth it to have a decent new playground for your favorite warriors. Since this game is all about the extension of the gameplay for the fans, the new additions are well worth it if players need to squeeze just a little more out of the game and fight a few thousand more opponents to keep the world safe.   As for how the game looks with all those soldiers the engine is no different from before with the same qualities and problems. There is a serious fog of war in effect with only the nearest few dozen soldiers appearing on screen. It can be disconcerting to see soldiers pop-up right in front of you, but if you monitor the map this shouldn't be surprising and it generally keeps the game fast. However, there are still some times of huge slowdowns in both single-player and two-player games.As an expansion pack, Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends is a great addition for the hardcore who can't wait to KO some more Japanese soldiers. For everyone else out there who wants to see the game the original Samurai Warriors is highly recommended as a massive hack'n'slash game that drops players into huge battles. If you get that game and it begins to rule your life, then check back here for more of the greatness. This game has been made strictly for the fans and it shows with tweaks and alterations in just about every area.", "date": "Nov 16, 2004"}
