The French publisher's unforgettable outings have taken imaginative gamers to the mythical land of the Aztecs, immersed them in the intrigues of imperial China, and drenched danger-seekers in the fascinating culture of the sunken city of Atlantis.  Invariably, due to it's unique content, of all the places you may have visited courtesy of our foreign friends the big A-town's gotta be the toughest act to follow.  Still, for better or worse, the boys from the land of wine, cheese, and excess perfume couldn't resist the prospect of a sequel. Ladies and gents, meet Beyond Atlantis.  Sooner or later, it's to be hoped that companies will discover a new way of marketing their Myst clones.  Cliched stories about the aeons-old struggle between Light and Darkness just don't cut the mustard anymore.  And what ever happened to macho-men and girly- girl heroes and heroines?  Months of manpower are dumped into the project and the best main character Cryo could come up with is some hobo descendant of an Atlantean that's pushing some kind of Downs Syndrome look...what's up with that?  Guybrush Threepwood's rolling over in his grave, I assure you.  The principles of time and space mean nothing to this strange agent, since his psyche travels to the four corners of the globe and visits with the inhabitants of Ireland, China, Tibet, the Yucatan, and Shambhala.  Temporary out of body experiences allow you to undertake weird assignments such as the recreation of a broken skull or the daring rescue of caterpillars and butterflies from a spider's web.  Search and retrieval missions are common, though combination and placement puzzles are set before you as well.    Cranium crunchers require you to place dishes down in their proper order, adjust miniature jungle paths, and heft hyperactive horses (don't ask).  Unlike most of the junk Dreamcatcher peddles, Beyond Atlantis puts forth conundrums that are reasonably difficult, not impossible, to solve.  Solutions can be obtained through a running dialogue with the game's characters, who range from pious old priests to birdmen, or by paying close attention to the designs and patterns you'll stumble across during your journeys.  An ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it~ approach was taken to the user interface.  A click hither or thither will march you off in the direction that's been highlighted, while wiggling the mouse in a circle lets you pan around the environment searching for points of interest.  Hot spots spark the cursor into animated activity when selected, eliminating the need to squint or bust out with a magnifying glass in order to closely scrutinize the landscape.  Stunning visuals, once Cryo's forte, are notably absent from the title.  Sunny, windswept vistas and shadowed temples drip with potential, but they're crippled by an engine that contains nada in the way of support for graphic resolutions higher than 800 x 600.  Along the same lines, what should be lifelike characters who desire to chat amiably with the player look like plastic figurines trying to swallow mouthfuls of bile instead.  Their uninmpassioned delivery of the corny script is equally awful.  Braniacs starved for a challenge could do a lot worse than Beyond Atlantis, cosmetic flaws notwithstanding.  We're not staring down an unmitigated disaster of Traitor's Gate sized proportions, but it's not like Cryo pulled out all the stops on their latest export either.  Adventure game groupies won't be totally off base adding it to their summer hit lists, but as for the rest of the squad, let's just say Dracula Resurrection's looking better and better with every passing day.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jul 26, 2000"}
