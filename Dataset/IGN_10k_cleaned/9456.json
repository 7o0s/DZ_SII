Either way, it's a gaming experience that should only be undertaken while drunk or, uh, otherwise altered - much like the TV show. So in a sense, Zombie Ninja Pro-Am is probably the most accurate licensed game ever created. I think only the Desert Bus mini-game in the unreleased Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors for the SEGA CD, where you're forced to drive for eight hours in real time from Los Angeles to Vegas (earning just a single point if you actually do it) actually screws with its fanbase more.   But then this is nothing new for Aqua Teen. The Adult Swim cartoon - and indeed the staff at Williams Street that pump out a number of shows for Cartoon Network's college-age programming block - has managed to regularly pull psyche-outs. They promised to air the entirety of the Aqua Teen Movie shortly before it hit theatres, then followed through on April 1st by showing the whole thing without sound with massive pop-ups and the actual video being so small only someone with a 70~ TV would have gotten much out of it.   Sigh. This is the mindset that's gone into making the program for its consumers, and it's with that mindset that I've come to the conclusion that the four-or-so hour experience of smashing balls across impossible courses only to sloooooowly amble toward where the ball stopped (while fighting about a half-dozen different enemies every single time) is meant to be an exercise in pain. There will no doubt be people out there that pick up the game and scour the levels to collect the 12 minute-long Cameo Clips of characters from the show, but to be perfectly honest, the best part about the game is the fact that you can watch four full episodes without ever touching the ~game~ - one of which was never aired (for good reason, as it's one of the worst ever made).    Also included were a trio of races against the two alien frat boys in a jalopy of a golf kart with roof-mounted homing missiles and turbo boosts scattered all over the course. They serve as a welcome break from the tedium of actually golfing, but they really are a mini-game at best. Of course, in Zombie Ninja Pro-Am, they take up a quarter of the whole game.    The rest is just powering through the golf sections, occasionally picking up power-ups to help slog through the enemies that constantly spawn (though it's easier to just dash to the ball and then clear out all the enemies that follow) or power-ups that let you cheat by either hitting Meatwad and steering him around or zapping the ball for more distance. Mulligans, the Foreigner Belt that turns enemies to ice, Enchaladitos for restoring health and Ol' Drippy (extra lives) all add flavor, but they're really just there to further convince people that it's an actual game.    Does it mean to be terrible? Added fuel to the fire that this is all a practical joke: the game's visuals are almost painful at times. The framerate swings from insanely smooth (when looking at the ground) to a control-affecting level of choppiness, and the cutscenes done with in-game assets don't really look much like the show. At least it sounds like the show, with cameos from MC Chris, Andy Merrill and tons of cameos from minor characters (Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past, Turkitron, the Mooninites, the Plutonians, and so on) throughout. Hell, they even used Andrew W.K. ~Party All The Time.~ Nearly all of the dialogue is repeated so often you want to tear your ears off.It's entirely possible that in a few years, this game will be looked on as one of the more creative uses of the medium to tell a joke; some kind of meta-humor that will be embraced and loved for its so-crappy-it's-awesome-ness. Unfortunately, at least for the time being, the game still costs $30, and as nice as it is to have four episodes of the show, you can get all of 'em and a whole lot more on DVD. For about $10 less. Unless you've got a bunch of ATHF fans over and some way to get altered, the game really is an utter waste of time. It can be a hilarious waste of time (Meatwad's caddy pep talk was brilliant), but a waste none the less.For the giant kick in the nuts that the game offers in actual gameplay, there are times when the writing pokes through and makes the title entertaining enough to keep going - provided you're a big fan of the series. If not, there's zero reason to play this game. Zero.", "date": "Nov 8, 2007"}
