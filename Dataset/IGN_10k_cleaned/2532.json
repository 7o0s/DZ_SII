{"name": "Eve of Extinction", "name_review": "Eve of Extinction", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/06/eve-of-extinction", "text": "While I have much admiration for Yuke's because of its tireless improvements to its PlayStation wrestling games (brought to the US by THQ under the WWF Smackdown name), I just can't figure out why it created this timesome action retread, Eve of Extinction.    Also known as EOE, Eidos' latest effort in the action genre leaves one agitated and bored within the first half hour of play by presenting a shiny generic tech hero who runs around smacking people with technologically advanced weapons (which happen to look exactly like Light Sabers) and looking to save the world from empirical damnation.    The game itself blends action with bits of platform jumping, and can be entertaining if you missed the last five years of PlayStation games. Ah, that little rub. But in the end, the drowsy story, populated by average superheroes and mindless bashing action is about as forgettable as an Archie comic book. Meaning, imminently forgettable (no offense to Archie fans, of course).    Gameplay  Oh, the humanity. When a game such as EOE arrives on our doorsteps the cynicism meter reaches redline and it's all we can do from killing collective selves. I slapped the disc into the PlayStation 2 for three dreary nights and played through what has to be the most average game on the face of the planet. It's not horribly bad, and it's not good, but its plainness, it's inability to keep one's attention, to draw an ounce of imaginative spark from the player's brain will be the horrible fate of it, and Eve of Extinction, like so many games from Eidos' checkered past in the action genre (Ninja, Urban Chaos, Fighting Force 2, etc.), will simply and quietly fade into the annals of videogame history. And hopefully it will stay there buried in the used bin collecting dust.   Not to charge up the good 'ol meanness machine or anything, but my job is supposed to be somewhat fun, and spending my time playing this game didn't live up to the hype. I'll explain. Players quickly learn with EOE that Josh Calloway is more than just a typical day worker at the mega-corp Wisdom. With worldwide military control as its core goal, Wisdom begins research into technological tools that would wield it tremendous power, but Josh and his co-worker/girlfriend Eliel Evergrand learn about its plans first, and try to make their escape from the clutches of the evil empire... Eliel was found out first, so Wisdom snared her soul from her body and encapsulated in the latest technological weapons, EOE. After Josh escapes he picks up various legacy weapons constructed by Wisdom and Eliel, inside them, narrates him through the game, talking inside his head.   The story is really neat little background for whacking Matrix-like bad guys with glow sticks. Josh gets a hold of about eight varying weapons, from the first two, the Sword (light saber) and Rod (Darth Maul's light saber), to the Katarm Snake Sword, Tongfas and more. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, exemplified by the rod, which can be used to jump long distances, and the Snake Sword, which stops time... Josh can also climb, hang, shimmy, and swim, if he's inclined.   But that's not all; each weapon is also capable of Legacy Drive attacks, the classic extra powerful attack that all videogame heads love. And naturally, in order to power up the Legacy Drive, players must find power-up locations, called Ley Seeds, pillars of swirling light spotted throughout the game. Collect two of these and you can splurge on Legacy Drive attacks. The Legacy Drive attacks are fun the first time through, then its yawn time. Their main purpose is to clear the boards, to wipe out the cabal of knuckleheaded baddies who inevitably surround you like evil kung fu monkeys waiting to get their asses whipped just like in Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan films. My turn...whomp! Next.    Filling in the ~whack-smash-hit~ gameplay with minor key chases and platform challenges, Yuke design fails to provide any inch of new ground in the action category, and with super-average (yes, for this game, things are actually extra average) enemy selection, players may even fall asleep in mid-fight. It's not just their look, but their behavior. One shoots a gun, one attacks using a weapon, and another is big, sports a new-age eye patch, and wears metal gloves (which are important for strangling you with). The enemies re-spawn all over the place, creating more of a tedious roadblock than an inspiring fight, and they're dumb as bricks. If you were as bored as I was, you can chase them around, leaping around their patterns and slowly torturing them to death with dinky shots to their limbs and sides. Evil, yes, but does it ward off boredom? Oh yes.   Graphics  Framed in a futuristic world, the landscapes of buildings and subways are as straightforward, plain, and unimaginative as an empty, brown paper bag, filled with dirt. As such, they look decent, and the subways, millions of hallways and other urban locations all reek of plain old used theatrical props.    The character design is quite average as well, although several of the middle-range bad guys and later bad guys are so ~evil~ looking that they are kinda funny looking, in a Mystery Science Theater kinda way.    As is the way with PlayStation 2, Yuke's was able to cash in on the lighting and particle effects in EOE. Nearly every weapon is a beam of light and all sorts of particles fly off everywhere when baddies connect, or cutscenes show off crashes or whatnot.    In the end, the graphics are actually less plain than the gameplay, but visually, no single item, background, character, or object will stay in your memory for long.    Sound  Wham! Smack! Ping! It's action theater folks, and EOE features lots of bad baddy dialog, a slew of weapon sounds, a stereotypical hard rock soundtrack, and if it weren't for the sweet voice of Eliel, I would forget that there was a soundtrack. Again, it's not terrible stuff, it's just below par, not quite average, phenomenally forgettable. It's an action game, I'm sure of it, because there is lots of smacking going, but it's not where the action is. EOE is a decent little action game to pass the time away, but only if you're desperate. If this game appeared on GameCube for instance, where there is a vast emptiness eerily sweeping around each and every dust-collecting system, it might actually entertain people, because new system owners are likely to like something better than nothing. Remember last spring on PlayStation 2? it was eerily quiet then, too. It happens. But on PlayStation 2 now, where there is so much selection, so many great action games, that a milquetoast, sub-par action bomb like this is completely forgettable. I wish it were different, but it's not. EOE is not the game you are looking for, to buy or to rent. You can go about your business now. Move along, move along.", "date": "Mar 6, 2002"}
