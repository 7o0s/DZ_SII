This rich fantasy adventure is both an eye-pleaser and a love letter to hardcore gamers that haven't quite put their Dungeons & Dragons rulebooks into storage.   I originally questioned whether or not the mobile landscape was appropriate for the first Orcs & Elves, especially since the bestselling titles for the platform are typically card and puzzle games. But id and its publisher, Electronic Arts, apparently did solid enough business with the game to not only warrant a mobile sequel, but also fashion an upgrade of Orcs & Elves for the Nintendo DS. Apparently, id saw mobile as a breeding ground for new ideas and original titles without the mass risk of capital. Here's hoping this continues to be the rule and not the exception.   Orcs & Elves picks up sometime after the original dungeon-crawler left off. You now inhabit the boots of Valin, a thief that has recently come into possession of a talking magic wand named Ellon. (You pick it up from the hero of the first Orcs & Elves.) Ellon has a bit of a lip on it, and your dealings with the sassy stick give the game a light touch of humor. Ellon isn't your only companion. You soon come into the company of Bob, a ~familiar~ that is able to reach small areas, such as rat holes, as well as help out with other puzzles.   Orcs plays out like a very traditional role-playing game -- and by traditional, I'm talking Apple II-era. That's hardly a slam, though. Those were solid mechanics back then, the leveling, the character management, and the turn-based combat on a world that has been invisibly sectioned off by a grid. (At moments, I imagine looking down at the game from above, not unlike Ultima II, and moving space to space across the game world.) You use the d-pad to move up and back, as well as turn Valin left and right before pushing him in those directions. Thanks to the speed of the game, this is hardly plodding. In fact, pacing is one of Orcs & Elves II stronger suits, as you are never just stumbling through dungeons and forests without a clue. Thanks to a smart map and a strong narrative, you're always on to the next sight and sound.   The game starts out in a dungeon, but soon explodes into a world divided into seven different locations. After the somewhat claustrophobic Orcs & Elves, this is a welcome addition to the sequel. You will battle beasts in the Dark Forest, explore towns full of non-player characters to visit with or buy items from, and check out a system of underground tunnels before fighting the game's final boss. You'll even see the inside of jail if you practice the ways of the thief (pick-pocketing for gold); thankfully, your thief is a skilled lock-pick.   The combat isn't as turn-based as some of the old you-go-they-go RPGS, but it's not action-oriented like Kingdom Hearts. There's a fine middle ground where you spot an enemy in the wild and can rush in to initiate battle or fall back in hopes of remaining undiscovered. When fighting, you advance to the ~square~ next to the monster and start slashing and poking with your assortment of weapons, such as a staff or fire sword. You can fall back a square if things are going poorly and attempt to regroup. If you're having trouble, try to catch an enemy off-guard before the beginning of the battle. Throw the dagger at them to shave off a little health before combat proper begins. You also have a few magic orbs, such as a Shrink orb that makes your enemies smaller and more manageable and a Freeze Orb that, well, freezes enemies. Use these orbs to thwart the tougher beasts.   There is a certain richness to Orcs & Elves II that is undeniable. There is so much content packed in this one download, from collectible items to a bestiary full of monsters. And these monsters look good -- each species features a nicely detailed design, such as the Treants or Wraiths. Areas culminate in tricky boss battles. You have stats to monitor and a journal for keeping up on the day's adventure. In all, this is a superb production that any RPG fan would be hard-pressed to dislike, unless they have a severe aversion to an RPG that doesn't follow the Square Enix mold.Admittedly, I don't always chime into mobile for a deep game, which is what Orcs & Elves II offers. However, thanks tot he game's quick save feature and wonderful pacing, I can see this being a great way to spend your bus ride home from your IT job. The game looks and sounds fantastic. id and Fountainhead have done a great job creating a colorful world that you'll really want to explore from one end to the other. If you fancy a mobile RPG, download Orcs & Elves II without hesitation.", "date": "Dec 4, 2007"}
