The smell of freshly cut grass is in the air, girls wearing short shorts are coming out of the woodworks, and beer is flowing freely from nice shiny taps. Oh yeah, and it's baseball season. Not only is it the season for real baseball, but those smarties in the marketing department figured out that if you put out new baseball games when the season starts, they sell more copies.  Go figure! So go pop a corn dog into the microwave, grab a beer (that is if you're over 21 of course) and read on about Microsoft's entry into the new baseball season.   When I picked up this game and loaded it up, I had some high expectations, and while the game fell a bit short, it still turned out to be pretty fun.  One thing that really impressed me about the game was the managerial Mogul technology.  If you are a fan of Mogul games, you'll really like this one. The game allows you to be commissioner, manager, and coach all at the same time, or not at all, and this makes it really easy for you to choose what you want to do with it.  The game interface game is simply fantastic. It's easy to navigate and really intuitive, which is good because the manual for the game is pretty lackluster. What I thought would probably be a chore of a time getting into the management of a team was really easy to do. Like I mentioned before, if you like the idea of managing a team some of the time or all of the time then you are really going to like this game. Even if you don't actually like to play the individual baseball games, you'll still like the game as it will play all of the games during the course of a season that you would like it to. So, play a few games and then take a look at your team's performance and change some things around. It's easy as pie.  It isn't necessary for you to be into the financial and managerial side of baseball to enjoy this game, but it certainly would help. I liked this game, and the gameplay was good, but if you are looking for a purely arcade style game with really good graphics, then you'll want to look elsewhere. The visuals in this game aren't terrific. Sure, they're not the worst I've ever seen, but the stadiums are flat, blocky and devoid of the life that I would like to see in a ballpark model.  The character models are also a tad bit short of fantastic. Only with the 3D acceleration, character detail, and resolution turned all the way up do the players look good. They are functional, have different batting stances, and some passable animations, but are just not nice to look at. There are a couple of nice touches such as the attempt to resemble the body size of the different players. They actually do a pretty good job at that with some notable exceptions like Randy Johnson who isn't the jolly 12-foot giant that you would assume he would be. He is the same height as everyone else in the game.  Darn!  The sound of a Randy Johnson fastball hitting a batter should be satisfying though, am I right?  The sound of a batter being hit by a pitch wasn't really as bone-crunchingly satisfying as I would have liked, but that's a minor nit-picky problem. Unfortunately there is a blaring sound problem with compatibility with a Vortex Aureal sound card. It has to be one of the most annoying things ever as the sound just skips and repeats itself like Tal after he's had .. ad .. ad .. ad .. ad one too many. The good news is that if you don't have this sound card, then the sound really isn't bad at all. Thom Brennaman, the Arizona Diamondbacks announcer, gives the play by play and sounds pretty good doing it. The sound of the crowd is as nice as it can be and the sounds of the game are not bad.  One thing that I really enjoyed about the game was actually playing. Even with the graphical and sound problems, this game is fun. The gameplay is solid. There are a couple of hiccups, but they don't ruin the total experience.  Batting and pitching are really a pleasure in this game. Pitching is pretty basic, but it is easy to control. Batting settings can be changed as you gain experience in the game. The beginner option just has you aim in the general direction of the ball and hit the swing button. The intermediate mode gets a bit harder as you get a warning about where the ball is likely to go, but you have to aim your bat right where the ball is. Advanced takes some practice but is really fun as you get barely any warning and still have to aim close to perfect to hit the ball. It sounds hard and it is kind of hard, but it is fun and it feels great when you connect for a hit.  Controlling the action after the pitch is a bit different. The game offers compatibility with several types of controllers, but I found that the keyboard gave me the best control out of the bunch. It takes a little time to get used to steering your guys around the field and aiming their dives and jumps, but once you get used to the controls, it isn't too hard to do. Frustrating as it is, errors are randomly generated by each player's fielding stats. So your team will occasionally throw the ball into the stands, or just completely miss a grounder, which tended to open up the bad language sector of my brain. As annoying as that is, it does add to the realism of the game.  I just have to mention one thing really quick that I really, really liked about the game. That is that you can hit the spacebar to skip through all of the waiting that goes on in-between pitches. I've played some baseball games in the past that didn't have this feature and those games got shelved rather quickly.  It's nice that Microsoft thought of the poor sap waiting around for the shortstop to throw the ball to the pitcher.  Although Microsoft Baseball 2001 is a sold baseball sim, this game hit a foul when it comes to details. Often times those little details, like the scoreboard actually showing the score (which this game doesn't do), make the difference between a good game and a great game. This is a fun game, but it really fell behind because of the lack of graphical detail. For those who don't care much about how the game looks and really like to play the part of manager, at only $19.99 this game is definitely worth the buy. It just seems too bad that in order to keep the cost down, Microsoft sacrificed some things that could have made this one of the best PC baseball games ever.  -- Dan Adams", "date": "Apr 12, 2000"}
