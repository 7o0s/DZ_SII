He's a hedgehog whose home has housed such mechanical contraptions as springboards, bouncing balls and pressure plates  most people more readily recall the open, grassy fields and high-speed running of Sonic's first adventures, but in those game's later levels the blue blur was always slowed to a stop by, essentially, gigantic pinball machines. Sega decided to take the next logical step.   Sonic Spinball arrived on the Genesis in 1993, and presented exactly what earlier games in the franchise had hinted at  throwing the hero into a fortress modeled after a pinball table and tasking him not with clearing levels quickly, but with skillfully navigating massive, vertically scrolling stages full of flippers, bumpers and tubes. Spinball isn't a platformer.  It has platforming elements, of course, but they're few and far-between. The core game is Sonic, stuck in his rotating, ball-shaped spin mode, getting batted, beaten and launched through the labyrinth of lights and loops  all for the sake of the Emeralds.   The Chaos Emeralds, staples of the Sonic series, are the power source of Dr. Robotnik's huge pinball stronghold. Acquiring all of them in each stage opens the way to that stage's boss fight, but it's not as simple as achieving a high score or sending Sonic sailing through the proper launch tube  each gem is hidden or protected in some way, and each one takes work to find and claim.            The first Emerald in the game, for example, is viewable from the start. It's sitting in a pool of toxic sludge, though. Before you can grab it, you'll have to have Sonic hurl himself bodily into the switches on either side of the tank that activate a draining mechanism, clearing the way of the poisonous goo.   Effecting change in the environment is key, and takes patience and persistence. A door you need to get through may be locked down, only to be open by repeatedly hitting a trigger on the other side of the level. An Emerald in plain sight may look like it should be easy to grab, but the tunnel connected to its holding chamber is hidden away somewhere. Sonic Spinball is a game of both skill and intuition  you first have to figure out what need to be done, in what order, and then you have to be able to control the wild, spinning hedgehog and keep him in play long enough to achieve your goal.    If achieve it you do, you'll be rewarded with some interstitial, between-stage mini-games. These are also based on pinball, but are presented from the perspective of Sonic himself playing a normal table with a normal silver ball. You'll be asked to free Sonic's animal friends, knock out a grinning Robotnik's spinning teeth, and more. And through all this, and the rest of the game, you don't have to play alone. Spinball supports up to four players, in an alternating, pass-one-controller style of high score competition.  As a 1993 release, Spinball benefited from a few years' worth of experience with the Genesis hardware  the system had been on the market for a while, Sonic was already established as a major mascot character, and there were even a couple of cartoons hitting the airwaves here in the States around the same time as this game's release. It was the perfect time for a solid Sonic spin-off game to complement the main platformer series, and Spinball filled that position well. It's not a perfect game  there are aspects of the control that could have been tighter, and its difficulty level may be a bit too extreme for new players. But it's a good option for Sonic fans, or pinball fans, or anyone who likes the idea of a game based on the concept of repeatedly hitting the hedgehog with giant metal flippers.", "date": "Mar 27, 2007"}
