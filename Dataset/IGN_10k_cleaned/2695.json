So be prepared: the Game Boy Advance will receive a virtual flood of pinball games for the system this year and next. The very first pinball title for the handheld system, Muppets Pinball Mayhem is a solid collection of original tables featuring decent physics and plenty of old-and-new school pinball designs. But you'll have to be able to handle the ancient license...but then, true pinball wizards don't care  who's pimping the tables, as long as the action is true to the game.FeaturesFour pinball tablesCompetition and Adventure modesCartridge save for high-scores and adventure modeOnly for Game Boy AdvanceDigital Eclipse, the developer of Muppets Pinball Mayhem, built a compilation of four distinctly different pinball tables, each revolving around a specific muppet. Kermit's table features a ~movie~ theme, with players knocking the silver ball around giant popcorn and soda tubs and sending it through a revolving theater door for bonus points. Ms. Piggy's machine is an obnoxiously, overly pink girlish design with lots of gems and diamonds sprinkled around the layout. Gonzo's got the most ~open~ of the tables, but it's also the one with the highest energy level since this is the ~daredevil~ of the Muppet community. The fourth...well, it's hidden. And we don't want to ruin the surprise. But its design is a real animal.The real test of a good pinball game is how well it handles the physics, since pinball is a real-world game with many familiar ~constants.~ The way the ball rolls across the field, the way it ~feels~ against the flippers, how well it travels up and down the tables' network of ramps. And for the most part, the physics model feels true-to-life...real wizards can even pull off the skillful ~switch flippers~ trick, or strategically nudge the table to avoid getting a lost ball down the side drains. Of course, a pinball game wouldn't be a good design without solid table layouts, and Digital Eclipse's team pulled off some very believable creations that could exist successfully in the real world. These tables could definitely be built as actual pinball machines, without the exaggerated ~squash and stretch~ effect of the bumpersbut, of course, the Muppets license isn't the most timely of brands, so don't expect Midway or Data East or any other pinball manufacturer to be building these suckers for your arcade...Each one of this cartridge's four tables features all the pinball goodies: ramp combos, extra ball triggers, even the ability to lock balls in for a little three-ball multiball action. The game handles the multiball as well as can be expected...since the ~camera~ needs to scroll to see the whole table, multiball action locks the action to the flippers at the bottom of the screen. It's really the only way the multiball action can work on the small screenbut it does hinder the strategy of aiming to the ramps, and seeing exactly what bumpers and triggers are lit. A pause during action could have helped somewhat in this design, giving players the ability to manually scroll the screen while the action is suspended. But instead, players will have to whack the spheres blindly during the three-ball mode.Muppets Pinball Mayhem uses the included cartridge save to its utmost capabilities; each table will save three of the highest scores to memory in both the three-ball and five-ball modes...a definite godsend to players obsessed with beating their last pinball session.One element that doesn't need to be there is the graphical effect of the ~Frenzy Mode.~ If you do well, the ball will start shooting off dozens of stars, virtually covering your ball from view. Since the stars zip off your ball in an independent direction, it actually throws off your timing and sense of direction...so essentially (and possibly unintentionally) you're being punished for doing well in the game.Though the game looks great, using the GBA's capabilities to decent use, the sound is probably the weakest of the pinball game's elements...the tunes are subtle enough for background audio, but the samples used for both the instruments and the Muppets' specific sound bites are of really low quality. It's not a game youd want to strap on a set of decent headphones, that's for sure.Years ago when I frequented arcades every weekend, I wouldn't just go to see what new videogames hit the sceneI'd also walk the row of pinball machines to whack a few silver balls around. It's a shame that the whole market's dried up...playing videogame renditions of pinball is the next best thing, I guess, but it's definitely not the same thing. Digital Eclipse's pinball game, the first of many pinball games that will hit the GBA in its lifetime, is a good, solid premiere for the handheld, with most of the pinball elements that real engineers threw into their machine design. The Muppets license just doesn't really do it for me...don't get me wrong, I loved the show way back when, and the Muppets Experience at Disneyworld rocks the house. But the license isn't really that cutting-edge, and it doesn't really do much for pinball...even with all the Muppets elements, sound bites, and theme song thrown into the game.Perhaps Digital Eclipse should move forward with this solid engine, possibly reviving some of the true machines of arcades past for the GBA", "date": "Jun 6, 2002"}
