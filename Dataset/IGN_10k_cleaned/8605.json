Union Entertainment's adaptation of the stunning Christian Gossett comic book has had a rocky past, to say the least. The game was all but completed under the tutelage of Acclaim in 2004 before the illustrious publisher went under. After the demise of Acclaim, it seemed unlikely that we would ever see the game again. Almost two years went by before someone decided to seize the reins and realize the dreams of commie-loving comic book fans everywhere. That ~someone~ was XS Games. The company reassembled members of the game's original development team, and put them to work on taking the game off life support. Despite this storied history, The Red Star actually manages to deliver on the promise of blending old-school brawler mechanics with top-down shooter elements; it just might not be the game fans of the comic were hoping for.   The game, like the comic before it, takes place in an alternate version of earth, one run by warring totalitarian states. The story centers on the exploits of several members of the U.R.R.S. (United Republic of the Red Star) who discover that the war between their people and the dark armies of Troika was engineered by both sides to harvest the souls of the fallen in an effort to feed Troika's dark master. The game allows players to step into the boots of three different warriors ripped straight from the comic, the warkaster Maya Antares, her bodyguard Kyuzo, and the nimble resistance fighter Makita, as they shoot and slash their way through the ranks of evil. However, it is at this point that all similarities with the comic book end.  The shooter sequences provide some much-appreciated variety.  The Red Star plays out much like a standard beat-em-up game. Players progress along a fixed path, beating the crap out of everything that gets in the way. Enemies will constantly be thrown your way, requiring several different tactics to dispatch. Some are only vulnerable against ranged attacks, while others may require timed blocking and counterattacks to defeat. The game's three main characters each have their own particular strengths and weaknesses. Kyuzo is your standard tank character. He is slow moving, and powerful, but has little in the way of magical abilities. Makita, on the other hand, is quite agile, although her melee attacks don't pack that big of a punch. Finally, Maya Antares wields devastating magical attacks, although she is locked at the game's outset. At the end of every level, each of these characters can be upgraded in various ways depending on how well you do over the course of the level. This minor element of RPG stat progression, serves to further deepen the gameplay experience.   While the beat-em-up elements of the game are fairly well delivered -- the action is relentless, and the enemies fun to dispatch -- this would not have been enough to keep the game from becoming a repetitive button-masher. Luckily, the game's developers realized this, and found ways to constantly change up the game's action. There were several instances in each mission where the camera would shift to a top-down perspective. During these moments, players suddenly find themselves playing a game that is more Ikaruga than it is Final Fight. These instances are particularly thrilling, as massive enemies will fill the screen and spew stream after stream of bullet patterns across the screen. It is during these battles when the game is at its best. It's just too bad the beat-em-up stretches in between grow more and more tiresome as the game wears on.    All of this brings us to The Red Star's most glaring flaw: its difficulty. That's not to say that the game is all that hard; it isn't. Rather, the complete omission of any sort of checkpoint system whatsoever constantly creates frustrating situations. Some of the later levels can take around 20 minutes to beat, making dying on the final boss incredibly irritating. When first playing through a level, the game really doesn't feel all that repetitive; however, the fact that some of these levels will have you replaying them over and over makes for a truly tiresome experience.    While there are first-aid kits scattered throughout the levels, they are often placed too close to each other, creating empty stretches with no life refills. It's easy to find yourself trapped in a barrage of enemy bullets, with your life quickly draining away, and nothing that you can do about it. This ended up being a major problem with the game, and one that could have been easily remedied had the developers stuck a few checkpoints in here or there. Another problem that we ran into was the slightly wonky lock-on system. To lock on to an enemy, you must first aim at them, and then press R1. In many instances, this grows frustrating, as you'll find yourself firing blindly while struggling to get a lock on the right enemy.   The game features almost nothing in the way of story or dramatic presentation, which is too bad considering the quality of the source material. In between each level, players will be briefed on their mission objectives, but the distinct lack of voice-acting or full-motion video makes these scenes more annoying than anything else. Furthermore, the game has a lengthy load time upon boot up and several shorter load times before each level. Rather than hiding these load times in the mission briefings, players are forced to sit and watch progress bar fill up. Sure, it's not the worst thing in the world, but it isn't exactly what we'd call thrilling either.  Team up with a friend to take out your foes.  From a visual standpoint, the game is more than serviceable. The game runs at an almost constant framerate, barely taking a hit even when there are several enemies filling the screen with bullets. The game does a solid job of recreating the visual style of the comic books, although some of the more subtle touches of the Soviet-themed world seem to have been lost in translation. The characters are fluidly animated, but they can tend to be a little blocky-looking. While the environments do have some nice little touches -- the massive Skyfurnaces are filled with heat distortion and depth of field blur -- they often lack detail or depth. Still, the game possesses a clean look which belies the troubled development process which spawned it.   By far the most enjoyable aspect of the game is the inclusion of a two-player co-operative mode. Action games of this ilk practically scream for such a mode, but all too often our cries go unanswered. Not so with The Red Star. The game allows players to play through the entirety of the single-player adventure with a friend at your side. This alone should warrant some attention from fans of either beat-em-ups or top-down shooters. Unfortunately, your enjoyment of this mode may again be hampered by the lack of mid-level checkpoints. If your compatriot falls in battle, you are pretty much stuck by yourself for the rest of the level. The only way to bring your partner back from the brink of death is to snag one of the sparsely-placed health packs. This hampers what would otherwise be a smooth, fun multiplayer experience.  At this point, I must admit that I am a huge fan of the original Red Star comic book. As such, I immediately found myself disappointed by the games omission of the any of the comic series staple story elements. Why is there no mention of the atrocities at Kar Dathras Gate? How about just a simple explanation as to why you are slicing your way through swathes of telekinetic soldiers? Sure the main characters are the same as in the comic, but there is little else in place to remind gamers that they are indeed playing a game based on The Red Star license. Nevertheless, the distinctive blend of beat-em-up melee combat and pattern-based shooting action won me over in the end. If you are a fan of classic games in either of these genres, there is a lot to like about The Red Star. Ultimately though, the barebones presentation and the aggravating lack of checkpoints keeps this game from living up to the high standard set by the source material.", "date": "Jun 8, 2007"}
