You're revving the V8 of your tricked-out Mustang and, in the distance, 10 giant bowling pins stand like skyscrapers. Your aim is to knock them over, naturally, by flooring it along the run-up and - get this - flinging the driver out of the car and towards the skittles. Depending on the speed and direction of your approach, the wheelman flies through the air and skids limply across the oversized alley, crashing into the pins and - hopefully - notching up a strike. Seconds later your human projectile is loaded back into the catapult, ready for a second run.   Floating wizard hats  perfectly at home in Harry Potter, not so here.  Moments like this make FlatOut Ultimate Carnage a refreshing change to the Burnout-dominated drive 'n' destroy genre. Indeed, there's much more to do here than side-swiping other cars in a desperate clash for first place: there's the high jump challenge for starters, in which you have to toss your driver towards a score wall. Angling the throw Track-and-Field-style is all important, ensuring you get distance as well as height, because the further up the wall you get, the bigger the score that's awarded. There's a basketball minigame too, in which you dunk your fragile driver to score points, plus there are minigames themed around curling, darts stone skipping - all kinds of crazy stuff. Sure, they're pretty throwaway and won't keep your attention for much more than a few goes, but knobbling your hapless driver in all manner of weird ways is undeniably fun.   The same can be said for the main meat on Ultimate Carnage's bones, too. FlatOut is the main career mode and here you get a few quid to buy your first motor - a clapped-out jalopy or maybe a rusty pick-up - plus a few bob to make a couple of improvements. Then it's straight out onto the track and into a race, with no faffing around with engine tune-ups and suspension settings. Yep, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is an arcade racer at its core, one that's more about the raw thrill of white-knuckle racing than accurately recreating the drive model of a '78 Chevy.   In that sense - actually, in every sense - FlatOut is like Burnout; crossing the line first is your raison d'ete, but how you do so is pretty much up to you. You can play it clean by weaving through the pack and powersliding around the corners perfectly to edge out in front, or you can get dirty and ram, shunt and shove your way into pole position.   Drivers, yourself included, are catapulted through windscreens during nasty crashes.  The on-track carnage hits you the moment the starting light turns green at the beginning of your first race. It's simply impossible to make it around the first corner without getting into a scrape, unless you hang back and follow the pack around - but where's the fun in that? Besides, there's another reason why, apart from being a laugh, causing chaos increases your chances of victory. Your nitro juice increases with every scrape and the harder the shunt, the more boost you're awarded. A single spectacular crash is enough to max out your nitro, which can catapult you from fifth to first in an instant.     Well, in theory it is. See, every element of FlatOut Ultimate Carnage - from the opposing cars looking for a scrap to the obstacle-littered courses - is designed to create destruction. Trackside debris like bales of hay and boxes - even plastic garden chairs - can flip your car if you're not skilled behind the wheel. Petrol pumps that explode when you slam into them momentarily block the view of the track and can result in an accidental off-track detour. There are other obstacles to watch out for too, such as log-carrying trucks that spill their load over the track and jumps which, if you don't hit them head on, will toss your car like a freshly cooked pancake.   In fact you'll spend a lot of the race, initially at least, either negotiating your way back onto the track because you've been rammed into hedges or have overdone it going into a corner. This can be pretty annoying because even the smallest object, such as a cardboard box, can upend your car and send it spinning out of control.    Epic Burnout-style crashes mixed with MotorStorm levels of detail. Not bad, huh?  What's more, your car has a nasty habit of 'sticking' to vehicles if you collide with them. Hit them from behind, for exmaple, and your bumpers interlock, meaning you can't easily pull away - so when they careen off course they take you with them. You'll undoubtedly have to restart races countless times as result, which, if you've led for the best part of three laps, only to get pranged on the last lap, is downright wrong.   That said, hitting Y automatically places you back on the track in an instant. Admittedly it's a bit of a cheat, but because the other drivers recover from smashes so quickly - all too often we've reappeared on the track after a nasty smash, only to see fellow racers involved in the collision already shooting off into the distance - you don't have much choice but to hit reset at the merest whiff of a race-knobbling crash. Of course, by the time you reach the second race chapter in the FlatOut mode - the first is Derby, driving crapped-out bangers; next is throwing performance cars around tracks; and finally there's street racing - you should be adept enough to stay on track without resorting to cheap ways of winning. Nevertheless, the reliance on this feature - or more specifically your opponents' reliance - takes a certain amount of skill from the game.    That said, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage isn't short of top-notch thrillride action. In fact it's easily as enjoyable as any recent Burnout incarnation, only you're speeding through the backwaters of middle America rather than futuristic cityscapes. As we've mentioned before, FlatOut is fast and the feeling of speed, especially with the nitro on max, is one of the highlights of the game. The handling too, is almost spot on. It's a little twitchy at times, like when you clip what looks like a lightweight obstacle, only for your car to spin out as if it hit a brick wall, but those moments are in the minority. On the whole the controls are tight and responsive, and the powersliding is as satisfying as it is in any either Ridge Racer or Colin McRae DiRT.   The stunt minigames are fun and varied, but dont expect to waste hours playing them.  What's more, the game should be applauded for introducing new elements to the mix, such as the minigames mentioned earlier. The multiplayer game, too, does something a little different from your average racer. There are of course straightforward races, but there are also deathmatch derbies (last car standing wins) and the brilliant Head-on race mode, in which your car is turned 180 degrees at the end of each lap - sending you back into the pack of cars that were on your tail!Overall though, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage does very little new. It really does look and feel like the bastard child of Burnout - the action is almost identical and the crashes are much of a muchness. But somehow it doesnt really matter because FlatOut does everything an arcade racer should do, and admirably too. Its fast, its fun and yes, its dumb, but thats one of the reasons we like it. Its by no means perfect  visually its no DiRT and the way cars stick to yours when you hit them, making it difficult to turn, is damn annoying  but its enjoyable, and more so than more recent instalments from the Burnout stable.", "date": "Jul 4, 2007"}
