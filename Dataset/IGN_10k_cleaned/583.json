Not only did its wild time traveling antics stretch the limits of our imaginations, but the hovering time car was just the coolest! Ever since seeing our beloved high tech Delorean bear hover lifts and take to the skies so many years ago, I've been hooked on the concept. And what's this? Low and behold, it's finally been rebirthed, in such a way that hit me out of nowhere. During my first play session with Activision's Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense, I was driving around spreading my usual path of mayhem, when suddenly the Bus baddy became airborne! Images of the hovering train from the end of Back To The Future 3 flashed through my head. Could this be any cooler? I don't think it can.  Well, as it turns out, the hover feature in the game is mostly just a gimmick included for the cool factor, as it's not really needed, and it's very difficult to control. But it's all about the coolness, right?  In any case, the groovy sequel to Activision's 70's-themed Vigilante 8 is finally upon us, and it's in its top form on the Dreamcast. In fact, I'd call it the epitomy of the Twisted Metal-spawned genre. It doesn't really offer anything that new or innovative, but it's about all you could ask for in this type of game, remaining faithful to its roots and progressing the basic gameplay enough to keep it strong.  The backstory isn't incredibly ambitious, but it really doesn't need to be. Basically, Slick Clyde and his mean gang of cronies have been doing themselves some time travelin', and have hauled ass from the future back to 1977. With futuristic hover vehicles in hand, they were looking for some trouble, and they found it. Looks like the good ol' Vigilantes have got their work cut out for them.  If you've played Vigilante 8 or Twisted Metal, (I think there's about two of you who haven't) then you will feel immediately at home with 2nd Offense. The game controls surprisingly similar to previous incarnations in the genre, with only a few very noticeable innovations. Most notably would have to be the three types of special vehicle attachments - hover lifts, snow gear, and water gear. None of these are particularly useful, but they do rake in high marks for coolness. The aforementioned hover lift upgrade ranks highest of all on the cool-o-meter, and it does allow you to reach some things you couldn't before, but because of how awkward and unpredictably it controls, you'll usually find yourself trying to figure out how to ditch the attachment. Bobbing around sporadically with little control over your direction makes it hard enough to shoot at people, and altitude adjustment is very awkward for those used to pressing UP to point the nose downwards. The other attachments are pretty much the same story; the snow gear isn't particularly useful or frustrating, but the water gear is absolutely unworkable. The control in the water is so difficult that you'll never want to leave dry land after trying it once. The attachments are welcome additions, if only for their coolness factor, but unfortunately they aren't vital to the gameplay.  The game has its other small victories in terms of innovation, depending on how you look at it. For instance, they've implemented something of a combo system to the action. If you have the right amount of a certain types of ammo, you can perform special attacks by hitting combinations of directions and buttons. Experimentation is the key. The problem is I just wanna blow the $*%& out of things, I don't want to be overly conscious of what buttons I'm pushing. But, because of how much they stack the odds against you in the more difficult parts of the game, it's quite necessary to utilize your most devestating combos in order to succeed.  This type of urgency can be frustrating, as a group of baddies will make short work of you, and trying to get the right combo down while timing it right can be a real bitch. Incidentally, why don't these games give you AI controlled good guys? I mean, it's gang vs. gang, right? Then why is the gameplay always ~me vs. gang~? Getting your ass pounded on by 4 baddies at once with absolutely no outside help is really an excercise in frustration, and the additional mission goals don't make it one bit more fun. The ~find this and bring it here, but it's randomly placed each time, so you get to drive around in circles!~ goals in each level really aren't fun while you're getting smacked around from every direction. Fighting for survival is enough, I don't want to participate in a moronic scavenger hunt on the side.  Outside of those qualms, the actual game mechanics are quite well rounded. The default control set up is awkward, but with some customization (I like to make R acceleration and L hand brake) it is quite easy. The vehicles' steering seems overly twitchy for a while, which can really throw you off, but once you've logged some time into the game, you won't notice it.  Graphically, 2nd Offense is nothing to scoff at.  Besides some occasional slow down and minor pop up, I really can't think of much to complain about. It runs smoothly, the textures are detailed and varied, and the vehicles are modeled with scrupulous detail. In classic Twisted Metal fashion, your car's body will appear damaged to varying degrees as you take hits. While the battle damage itself looks good, I did notice that it only appears on enemy cars when you come a certain distance to them, which is slightly disconcerting, but not the end of the world. The cars have convincingly bouncy independent suspension systems, which really makes it look cool and realistic as you traverse difficult terrain or land from a jump.  The music in 2nd Offense suits the 70s theme well, featuring a lot in the way of funky soul tunes and wah wah-induced musical flourishes -- Some of it can get a little annoying if it isn't your particular cup of tea, but it is well done and diverse, nonetheless. The game's sound effects are also well played, with the voice samples standing out in particular. The characters' various witty taunts and retorts range from charming to amusing, but, as they often do in these games, become quite repetitive, particularly the lines spawned by a character's special attack.  Overall, Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense is a solid 128 bit installment in the Twisted Metal-spawned mini-genre, lacking nothing that makes these games what they are. Not only is it a solid title, but solid as a Dreamcast title.  Often, when a game is ported over multiple platforms, it doesn't see its full potential on all of them. I'm happy to report that 2nd Offense does, and is a good example of how to handle a multi-platform port (take note, Inforgrames). Fans of the genre will probably want to give it a hard look.  It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but it brings all the old ideas back in a big way.  -- Matt White, 8I was really excited to finally stick in Vigilante 8 in my Game Boy Color, just to see how well it was converted over from its rather cool PlayStation incarnation to the portable screen. They got some things right (the speech is excellent, and the graphics are nice), but the conversion is very sterile. I really miss being able to blow up tanks and buildings  instead, it's just a straightforward Combat-style game with very few options. It isn't bad, but don't go expecting that much out of it.", "date": "Dec 24, 1999"}
