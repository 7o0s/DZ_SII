Fishing simulations, for the most part, are a really good idea. So before you pop in ~Soviet Strike~ or ~Rally Cross,~ go ahead and take a fishing break. You'll find it quite relaxing.  The console vacation begins with some relaxing tunes to set the mode for a perfect fishing experience. Sure, you can go straight to the tournament and compete against some of the best fisherman of all time. The real joy is going out to ~Raccoon Lake~ and just cruising around in the boat.  The gameplay is fairly standard for a fishing game. The casting interface is nice. You can cast overhand or underhand, which is cool, and the camera angles during the reel-in fight are nice as well. You can't adjust them from the first person ~worm-cam~ view, but it works pretty OK overall. When you're in the boat, you change your view from left to right, but that's about it.  The graphics aren't that bad. The underwater environment looks colorful and the fish, well, they move like fish. However, there is some serious clipping going on under and above the water. The load time between every action is kind of annoying as well. Beside the flaws, there are a few redeeming qualities. In addition to all the ~fishy~ profiles, you can customize your fishing habitat while at Raccoon Lake. You can choose the month and time when fishing. This can definitely increase or decrease the chances of catching a good bass.  In the end, although Big Bass World Championship isn't the best fishing sim on the market, it is the best fishing game available for a next-generation console (or it was, anyway). Are there some problems, yes, and we think that Hot B's next game will probably be a big improvement, but for now, if you're looking for some fishing on your PlayStation, here's your best bet.
