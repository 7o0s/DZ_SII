Unlike most other racers, snowboard games aside, this takes place exclusively in the wintry regions of the world.  Since last year's Sled Storm, several developers have announced their own additions to the niche genre, but can any of them stack up where it counts?  Sno-Cross Championship Racing can. In spite of the fact that it could be deeper and offer more, it's fast, intense, and fun.   Gameplay Of all the modes to choose, Championship is especially difficult, but it rewards you with new vehicles and tracks.  In order to receive any of these, you have to come out on top after a series of races. That's not always a task that's easy to accomplish. When you first begin playing Sno-Cross Championship Racing, you are limited to only four snowmobiles and four tracks.  The more classes you win, the more you are able to do. The modes of play you can pick from are:  Championship: This is the bulk of the game and the perfect place to get started.  You have only four snowmobiles and four tracks you can race in, so it's up to you to enter the 500 CC and earn some more.   From the very start, you're up against some tough competition.  The three other people you race against are very aggressive and can take the lead if you don't watch what you're doing.  Of course, when you first enter the 500 CC race, the vehicles you are able to use don't work as well as you'd like.  The control is extremely harsh!  If you want to take a sharp left turn, you've really got to hold down the button.  If you hit a wall or run into an object, your mobile takes damage.  The more damage it takes, the less it functions. If your engine is really beat up, your chances of doing well in the race drop greatly.  Luckily, you're given the option to buy new parts or repair old ones before the start of each race.  It's absolutely necessary to upgrade your handling, grip, speed, and other attributes, because the snowmobile you first use has the lowest-quality crap on the market. If you've never played Sno-Cross Championship Racing, you are not going to be a pro when you pick up the controller.  Once you get used to the awkward turning, overcome your snowmobile's poor statistics, and win the 500 CC, things get better.  The higher you place at the finish line, the more prize money you're given.  It's beneficial to do your best, because that money is needed to bring your snowmobile back up to running condition. It is very easy to turn a vehicle into a practically useless pile of junk. The computer-controlled players can accidentally knock into you when you least expect it, ice will toss you to and fro, and other obstacles will cause you harm. To add some fuel to the fire, this damage is cumulative. If you don't fix it right away, your performance in future races will be affected.  The upgrades you can purchase are tracks, engines, front suspension, back suspension, and skis.  Of all these, the engines are the most expensive and are almost impossible to upgrade in the 500 CC, especially with all the repairs and other necessary work before each race.  It's smart to upgrade your handling if you've just started.  Otherwise, turning can be a bother.  To determine the overall winner of a certain class, points are tallied.  For first place, you receive eight points.  Second place gets six.  Third place gets four, and fourth gets two.  The racer with the most points at the end of all the races is the champion.  If that person just happens to be you, you unlock the next series of races and snowmobiles.  The snowmobiles you can use for each class are:  500 CC:    SX 500,  VMAX 500, Venture 500, and Phazer 500  600 CC:    SX 600, VMAX 600, Venture 600, and MNT MAX 600  700 CC:    SRX 700, SX 700, VMAX 700, and MNT MAX 700  Naturally, the higher the CC, the more difficult it will be to win.  Luckily, your vehicle's statistics also are improved and will hold out better in the later races.  However, your opponents' snowmobiles will also be upgraded when you enter the high-level classes. One gripe I have about the championship is that if you want to restart a track because you messed up, you can't.  The only option you're allowed is ~quit to main menu.~ That's a nuisance when the other guys are busy rocketing ahead and you're stuck with your face against a wall.  Single Race: If you want to avoid the fury of the championship mode, this is the best to enter.  Unless you've finished first in the championship and earned more tracks, you are restricted to only four areas:  Aspen, Kiruna, Calgary, and Murmansk.  Later, you will be able to access the three remaining locations:  Kitzbuhel, Nagano, and Munich.  Of course, you may also import any track you've designed with the track editor and race there.  In the single race, you race only (you guessed it) one single time.  You choose the track, you choose your vehicle, and you choose the weather.  If you are able to participate in the 600 or 700 CCs, you may also use any of that class's snowmobiles here.  This is the place to go for two-player action.  It's not very exciting, though.  The split-screen action really feels restrictive, and there's not much variety.  It's just you and a friend racing; no special versions, no bonuses, nothing exhilarating.  Unique Development Studios, the sweat and tears behind the game, could have done a lot more to make this one enjoyable.  What, for example?  Perhaps a ~get the flag~ mode, where the objective is to not be the fastest, but to obtain the most hidden flags before crossing the finish line.  Or maybe, just for kicks and giggles, a bonus 'weapon mode.' Sure, it might appear out-of-place, but it would be lots of fun to fire a heat-seeking missile at your buddy's snowmobile.  Time Trial: This is the classic time trial mode. Pick an available vehicle and an available track, including any you may have created, and race to the finish as fast as you can.  The only snowmobile on screen is you, so you don't have to worry about anyone getting in your way. Try to beat the best times and top yourself.  As with most racing games, this style of play is Sno-Cross' least attractive.  Hill Climbing: This is the most unique mode of play in Sno-Cross Championship Racing, but also one of the most fun.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to access it right off the bat.  No sir, fun doesn't come easy. You've got to earn this.  For those of you with a sense of danger, this is right up your alley.  The objective here is to speed  up an extremely steep hill.  Where's the danger in that?  If you mess up, you're as good as screwed.  Track Editor: The track editor really shimmers.  Not only is it simple to make your own tracks, but it's fun.  To build your dream course, you choose from twenty different parts and place them anywhere on the editor's grid.   Some of the parts you may use include straight roads, hard curves, double jumps, tunnels, canyons, bridges, and many more. In order for your track to function, it has to fit together without any empty spaces.  To fill in the voids, you can rotate the pieces so they connect perfectly.  After you've made what you want, you can save your creation and race in it at any time.  And since you can save multiple tracks to one block on your memory card, the options are almost infinite.  The only drawback, however, is that there's not a lot of versatility in the track editor's graphics.  You can choose to have your track set at day or night and have it rain, snow, or be clear.  Aside from that, it tends to look the same from one course to another.  Sno-Cross Championship Racing's courses are designed well and have jumps, buildings and tunnels placed in just the right spots.  Even from the early courses on, there's enough to challenge gamers.  Ice spots screw up your balance and throw you all over the place.  Obstacles, such as trees or even paths split by rocks, come out of nowhere and make you react quickly.  Snowy and rainy weather also has an effect on your ability to drive.  However, there are only seven tracks, not including hidden ones.  After a while, playing the same ones over and over again gets old, no matter which mode of play you choose.  It's a good thing that there's the track editor to back the game up.  One of the more overlooked features is the ability to perform tricks.  Unlike snowboarding games, pulling a trick here doesn't seem to hold much ground.  It's fun to do something cool in mid-air, but it doesn't affect the overall gameplay very much.  Doing a trick is hard as it is.  The only reason it would be good to learn tricks is for the championship.  The more you do, the more bonus money you receive at the end of the race.  Otherwise, it doesn't mean a lot.  Even with the championship, single race, time trial, hill climbing, and track editor modes, Sno-Cross Championship Racing feels a little lacking.  Overall, it's a lot of fun and intense, but it's missing something extra.  There should be short cuts, shouts from your opponents (especially when you smack into them), more upgrades, more special features to earn, and just plain more, more, more.  It's a good thing that the classes take some mastering to complete.  The 500 CC class took me about four or five attempts to move on.  This isn't your basic ~Mario Kart~ racer where you can easily win without much threat from the other players.  Even if you win half of the races, the others can knock you silly and take the lead.  It gets frustrating that the classes can be difficult to win, but it pays off in the end.  It keeps you coming back with the hopes that you'll reap the benefits of coming in at first place.  Graphics  If nothing else, this game looks great. The textures are realistic, the weather is atmospheric, and the animation is smooth.  Everything is very immersive.  The first race, for example, takes place in Aspen.  The track is decorated with homely-looking buildings, evergreen trees aplenty, and so on.  You really get the feeling that you're participating in a race on a lovely Aspen locale.   The minor details add a lot, too.  There are stars hanging in the village street from tinsel, people ride the ski lifts up to the slope, and cabins are off to the side.  These are the kinds of things, which illustrate each track.  In more snowy, darker weather, things are just as beautiful.  The sky is painted with a grayish hue, and snowflakes scatter from the sky.  Everything looks just as perfect as it should.  Both you and the other competitors kick up snow dust as you race down the track, leaving marks with your skis.  It's all done very well.  UDS did its homework, and it shows in the tracks, snowmobiles, and other beautiful effects.  The biggest complaint I have about the graphics is that they take a while to load.  But they've got style -- especially the video and menus.  These were made to look techno-pumped, no doubt about that. The main interface is sassy.  The pre-rendered graphics while things load are nice.  The introduction video has wild text effects and fast snowmobile action that accompanies the feel well.  Sound I'm a humongous fan of electronica.  I own music from the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Orbital, Moby, and Underworld.  Then again, I own music from the lesser-known artists, like Roni Size, Aphrodite, Praga Khan, Coldcut, Uberzone, and dozens more.  I can smell crappy techno from a hundred miles away.  Sno-Cross Championship Racing has crappy techno up the wazoo.  It's fast, it's electronic, and it's everywhere.  That's about all I can say in its favor.  It's meant to get your adrenaline pumping, and it does the job if you don't pay attention to it.  I sat down and listened to the tracks, and they are quite poor.  There's absolutely no composure whatsoever.  It's just ~fast beat, noise, fast beat.~  I don't even know how to categorize it.  It's like drum and bass on Ritalin.  As for the sound effects, there are really only two different kinds, but each has a few variations. The first sound effect, your engine, sounds better than those in other racing games I've played.  The more pressure you put on your snowmobile to go, the more it whines and groans.  It sounds very realistic.  The other sound effect is an impact noise, and is less impressive.  When you hit something, it makes some sort of a ~clunk,~ depending upon how hard you hit it.  There should have been some voice acting in the game.  It would have been entertaining to hear the other racers yell obscenities at you when you bash into them.  They should laugh at you and make some snide remark when they pull ahead of you.  Those kinds of things would do the job. At the beginning, I thought this game was going to be extraordinarily difficult.  The control was loose and it seemed like I'd never be able to get first place in a single race.  After I spent more time with it, Sno-Cross Championship Racing proved to be a very fun game.  Although there are only seven main tracks, an average two-player mode, and a ho-hum time trial, I had a good time.  The track editor's what I enjoyed the most, and is the main reason to play the game.I was a bit disappointed with the ability to perform tricks.  I was hoping that there would be a mode, like in 1080 Snowboarding on Nintendo 64, where you could go against a friend to see who can pull off the best tricks and earn the most points.  Something like a half-pipe, but more appropriate for the snowmobile scene. Perhaps that will have to wait for a sequel.  Until then, Sno-Cross Championship Racing will still put a chill on the dog days of summer.", "date": "Aug 9, 2000"}
