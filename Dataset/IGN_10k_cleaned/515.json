No, it's because it doesn't pretend to be anything else but what it is -- a compilation of classic games that originated as LCD tile-animated pocket games. And Game & Watch Gallery 3 continues the series with even more early 80s history, offering Game Boy gamers something they might have missed when these pocket toys came out almost two decades ago. There's lots to like here. Features Classic and updated modes of six (or more) classic LCD games Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Game & Watch 3, like the previous games in the series, is just a simple compilation of old LCD games with limiting animations, as well as detailed sprite updates of the same games. The original games are represented in their same, on/off tile animations and ~blip~ sound effects, while the ~modern~ versions are renditions using more recognizable characters, smoother animations, and extra power-up and bonus items. They both have their own charms -- play the originals to see what we were playing during the 2600 days...and then when you've got the feel, see what Nintendo did to bring the same game to the console era.  Here's a brief descriptions of each of the initial games in Game & Watch 3: Egg:  In this game, you'll have to try and catch the falling eggs before they fall and crack on the floor. The modern version has Yoshi saving cookies. Turtle Bridge:  Can you get the packages across a bridge made from the backs of turtles? Or get Toad across the back of storks in the update? Greenhouse: A bunch of insects want your plants, and you'll have to be quick to protect the foliage. Have Yoshi spit watermelons at the bad guys in the modern version. Mario Bros.: Mario and Luigi have to move parts along a conveyor belt without dropping them. Donkey Kong Jr.:Big ol' DK has been locked up by Mario, and it's up to Jr. to rescue him.   What's also fun is to see how Nintendo ~Mario-izes~ these games that originally had nothing to do with the company's mascot. Greenhouse featured a generic gardener spraying bugs to protect his crop, and the updated version features Yoshi, spitting watermelon seeds at Shyguys and monkeys. The new Turtle Bridge has Toad hopping over a bridge of storks popping balloons, delivering mushrooms from Mario to the Princess -- the original is that same generic guy hopping over the backs of turtles, delivering a letter from one side to the other. It's really clever how Nintendo worked its familiar property into the games with vague premises.   And while there might only be five games up front, continue playing these games for the highest score possible. As you cross certain thresholds, you'll earn ~stars~ which unlock features hidden in the game. Sound tests, histories, and even a hidden game or two will open up, and save to the cartridge. You can even save any game in progress simply by pausing the action and turning off the system -- when you turn your system back on, you can start right back where you left off. Hey, the games may be fun, but they do get a little tedious after a while -- and Nintendo realized this.  It's not going to take a permanent place in the back of your Game Boy's cartridge slot, but Game & Watch is a great diversion -- and each game pak has gotten increasingly better. This one is indeed the best of the bunch, simply because there are so many extras to uncover. Just don't expect anything more than what they are -- simple games for simple technology. We salute you, Gumpei Yokoi.
