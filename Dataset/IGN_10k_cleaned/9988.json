Instead of going to parties and getting hammered, I sat on my couch and played level after level of Starwave's perplexing pedestrian carrying puzzler. I ended up with the same headache alcohol would give me, minus the hangover.   Rush Hour is simple. In a 6-by-6 grid, the goal is to move your taxi cab to the exit on the right side of the screen. You can only move your taxi left and right, while cars that are in your way must be shuffled around you, clearing a path to the exit.    The game starts with the easiest learning curve for a puzzle game. So easy in fact, that level one doesn't even have any cars on the grid. All you have to do is move your taxi to the exit. Cars appear once you hit level two. There are two obstacles to overcome, the cars in your way and the clock that's ticking. You have a three minute time limit for each level, which isn't a factor at first, but as the game progresses the clock is going to be your biggest enemy.    Most of the puzzles are pretty simple to figure out, and if you've played games similar to this you shouldn't have a problem getting through Rush Hour's 45 levels. You can only move your taxi and other cars in the direction they're lined up in. If a truck is lined up vertically, you can only move it up or down. This is the challenge of the game, trying to clear that not so obvious path to the exit.    Controls are simple, and you use left, right, up, down and the center button to move the cars. I played this game on an LG Chocolate and its control pad just isn't that suitable for gaming -- but that is not a detraction from the game itself. Since you can click it or rotate the center pad like an iPod, a lot of times my icon would fly all over the screen and there were even moments when the icon refused to actually move and I had to start the level over again. I blame that more on the Chocolate, though, not the game.   The game doesn't save automatically after each level, so I implore you to do this yourself after each puzzle completed. You don't want to spend twenty minutes figuring out a puzzle, only to turn your phone off and realize you forgot to save your progress. I did this one time and quickly discovered that LG Chocolate phones do not have the floating flight dynamics I thought they would when thrown from a second story window.   An editor mode is included, so you can design your own puzzles. Free Play lets you play any puzzle you've already completed, so you can practice how long it takes you to complete one. What's also important about Free Play is it gives you the solution to the puzzle you're stuck on. I never needed this feature because along with being extremely handsome, I'm super smart. Ok, so I needed it a few times. You can upload your best times to the Community center and compete with other virtual taxi cabbies.   The graphics are nice to look at and the animations are very cartoony and colorful in the Story mode. The game grid itself is what lacks any variety. Every puzzle has the same looking trucks and cars, and after a while it becomes dull to look at. I would liked to have seen more variety in the vehicles used, and maybe a level at night with a different background. Music is light and pleasant but isn't necessary to the experience. I turned it off along with the vibrate feature. The game vibrates so often bystanders may think you're having too much fun with your phone.  Rush Hour Taxi Trouble is a game puzzle enthusiasts have seen before, just in a different wrapping. If youre into this type of game, you do get your moneys worth and creating your own puzzles adds to the replay factor. But like riding in a real taxi cab, dont expect the flashiest of experiences.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
