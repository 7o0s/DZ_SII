Handed down around the burning keyboard, the story has been told of the days when one would walk around and click on things, or use the keyboard to construct magical phrases that would unlock secrets. Afterwards, the true believers in the adventure game dance a sacred dance, repeating the mantra:~Put candle on rug.~ ~Use candle with rug.~ ~Use candle on rug... [arrrgh!]~ ~Use rug with candle~This sequence goes on for hours, until one of the believers uses the correct phrase, at which point the group gives a collective sigh, and respond with an joyous uproar of mouse clicks.It seems that the adventure game hasn't been dead at all, though -- it's just gone underground, had a little plastic surgery, and kept in the shadows waiting for the time when it could reappear. Omikron is one of the first true sighting of the new adventure game in full force, and it provides an adventure that, despite its action/fighting game trappings, delivers a story and adventure that will keep you playing until the end. The Hybrid to End All Hybrids In Omikron, you play... yourself. When you start up the game, you are visited by a man named Kay'l, who tells you of a parallel world that need your help. Transfer your soul to his, and you have a chance to help out a universe you never even knew existed. Which is all fine and good, except for that part about the demons. Seems that it's all a big trap to get outsiders into the world of Phaenon, which has become inhabited by demons who walk among the humans and steal their souls, sending them into eternal damnation in order to feed ASTAROTH, a might big beast bent on ruling the world. And guess who has to stop him? I don't want to spoil anything else for you, but the plot becomes more and more confusing as the story goes on, adding characters, companies, and creatures to the list of characters that become involved in the city of Omikron and its neighboring sections.On top of being able to switch bodies, the number one gossip among fans about Omikron is that it's the first real ~all-in-one~ gaming concept in years to come around. Though you'll spend the bulk of your time exploring the vast cities that make up Phaenon, you'll also have the chance to take out enemies in a first-person mode, and fight them in hand to hand combat using combos and techniques similar to console fighters like Tekken.Though the shooter is heavily scripted (enemies come out in the same way at the same places), it's still a fun, but simple, piece of action. The fighting game comes out on top though, with some fun combos to learn, and nice animation for the characters as they brawl it out everywhere from apartments to supermarkets. Even if they were bad, you don't spend enough time in either action sequence to detract heavily from the overall gameplay, but thankfully, they both become more entertaining and elaborate as the game progresses. But is it really a hybrid? Not really -- think of it more as an adventure game with some big, big bonuses. What a Wonderful Word This Could Be Forget the fighting and the shooting, and you've got one of the largest adventure games (in terms of sheer territory) to date. And more importantly, it feels like a true foreign city. You're first instinct is to run around every alleyway, and check out every shop, and for the first time in a game, you're allowed to do just that. Buy some supplies at the drugstore, grab some Kloops at the local grill, buy some poetry at the local bookstore, or go see a song at Harvey's bar. The performance is one of the most incredible pieces of the game, since A: You're able to sit and watch a complete song, with lip-synced singing and dancing in the middle of a game, just because -- and B: It's David Bowie who's doing the singing in the game with his bandmates, as the band ~The Dreamers.~ The detail level becomes more an more incredible the farther you play. If you liked the Dreamers song that you heard, why not track it down at a shop and buy the Transcan single? Find a Transcan player, and you're able to listen to the complete song while you're sifting through someone's else laundry for keys, weapons, and money (uh, at least that's what I like to do). Though at its core the game is still very, very linear (most of the time, you must find object A to unlock or open object B, there are a variety of side-quests that you can take on at your leisure, including a secret fighting tournament that can easily take up hours of your time on its own. It's a vast world, which can quickly become overwhelming -- but don't worry, the designers have taken good care of you.All of this confusion is handled slickly with your sneak, an arm-bound computer that keeps track of major events, holds a map, keeps your inventory, and calls your Slider, a car which you can drive around the areas in Phaenon, or have drive you to the next major destination. What the slider really does, however, is keep the city from becoming tedious. Get bored of walking? Take the car. Get bored of driving? Have it drive you to the next place you need to go to, even faster. As you find out about locations, they appear as destinations on your Sneak, which makes for an ingenious way to keep the pace of the game as free as the world itself. It's an incredible feeling to know that if you've seen it, you can go there, and if you hear about it, you can find it. Hidden bars, secret passageways in offices, secret messages hidden in someone's locker -- it's more than just finding items, it's the impression that you're setting foot in someone else's life that makes the game so exciting -- and isn't that why we play games in the first place? More Characters Than the Cover of Sgt. Pepper's Once you've attained the resurrection spell in the game, you'll have the ability to move bodies using Mana and some know how -- there are a variety of characters just waiting to be inhabited, from Betsy, a Journalist that you find in a drugstore, to an alien-looking Azekeel Farmer name Fodo. There are over 30 characters in all, some of which are vital to the plot, and others which just allow you to fit yourself in a different skin for a while. Access their apartments, see their lives, and sometimes, get another key to the puzzle of Omikron. The fact that a lot of the characters are completely unnecessary is actually one of greatest design tricks of recent times. Games have gotten so advanced that many of us want to enter a world simply to do nothing. I'm sorry if I sound gross, but yes I would love to sit at a table drinking kloop as a speed-junkey Slider racer.Keep in mind, however, the world sees you for how you look, so playing a thief and trying to sneak into the police station just isn't going to cut it. The concept pays off, in nothing else, for yet another sense of the size of the world that you're inhabiting, and the people who's lives depend on the city for existence. A Little Big City Blues What I'm most impressed about with Omikron is how it never stoops to a low level with its storyline -- it handles relationships in a very adult manner, and adult subjects maturely. Though you'll have the ability to explore seedy sites like a strip club, a peepshow, and even a sex shop, it never feels any seedier than, well, it should feel. In other words, yeah it's a strip club, but it's in the red light district, just like the strip clubs in real life. It's part of the cities in Phaenon just like they're part of the cities in San Francisco or New York, or Boise, and they're just one of the many sights that you'll gaze on in your adventures.The graphics in the game are incredible, and give the game most of its parallel-universe appeal. The game avoids most futuristic Blade Runner mimicry by making outfits and characters much more outlandish -- tattoos, body paint, and a lot of fabric (or none at all) seem to be the fashion statements in modern day Phaenon. The sliders glisten with metallic shine, reflecting the skies and the world around them. The buildings may be the biggest things you notice at first, but you'll quickly find your eyes popping at the detail that Quantic Dream has pulled off with the characters. At times they look frighteningly real, with faces that react with emotion, and mouths that move along with the voice dialogue, which is pretty high quality, particularly Bowie. Speaking of which, it attests to the designer's detail that even with a completely different look, the Bowie character is still instantly recognizable. It seems like a small thing to create detailed faces, but in fact, it goes a great way towards connecting you with the characters, and creating an individual feel for the inhabitants of the world.In terms of speed though, I did have some serious problems with framerates, particularly in some of the shooter sequences, which seemed to clog up at random -- sometimes they would run fine, at other times they would bog down for no apparent reason. The amount of detail can be customized for your computer's comfort level though, including everything from vision depth to the amount of pedestrians and traffic on the street. All but the fastest computers will be able to handle this one in high-res everything, so be warned -- I wouldn't attempt any Omikron-ing unless you have a fairly meaty system. Unfortunately, if you want the best response, you should do the full install, a whopping 1.6 gigs of space. If you've got it, use it -- otherwise, be ready for some possible problems, depending on how slow your system is. All of this doesn't necessarily kill the game, but it certainly detracts from the gameplay, especially when the music and sound effects become affected by the slowdown problems.The soundtrack is incredible, and fills most of the game with a selection of driving but ambient electronica, crafted by Reeves Gabrels and David Bowie, as well as the songs included in the game (eight out of ten songs on the new album, if you're counting). Though some people in the office felt that the performance sequences were a bit too long, I thought that they fit in perfectly with the overall game -- though it would have been nice to be able to skip them, particularly when playing through a sequence again.Though the action sequences haven't been given the amount of polish as the adventure world, it's still a pretty solid attempt at combining a multitude of gaming genres into one huge world. There were very few times when I didn't enjoy sections of the game, particularly when the plot throws you curveballs, sending you on a mercenary raid or on a hunt for a small shop that fixes Sneaks, when you were expecting something completely different. The whole game has been crafted from the ground up to provide you with a variety of adventures, and it succeeds. Omikron is a world that, due to that little demon problem, I probably wouldn't want to stay in forever, but I'll certainly go back and visit, often. Perhaps an online-only version for the sequel? Just kidding.Sort of.-- Vincent LopezNOTE: I had some problems switching disks in Omikron, due to my newer CD drive -- it isn't a problem with the game itself, just with certain drives that don't want to spit out a disk while it's spinning. Best bet? Press eject, wait a while, then press enter. There's probably a dialogue box behind the Omikron splash screen that you need to respond to. Otherwise, it's time to bite the bullet and install the entire game on your hard drive. Yeowtch.", "date": "Nov 13, 1999"}
