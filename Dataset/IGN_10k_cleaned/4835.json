I'm nowhere near qualified, seeing as my low tolerance for *real* gore and less than perfect eyesight will forever bar me from carrying an FBI badge. But there's always a digital alternative to everything in real life, right? Games like Missing: Since January offer would-be investigators a chance to track down a killer.    Thing is, game developers usually don't make games like Missing. I think Missing is one of only two games in the faux reality/thriller subgenre, with the only other title being EA's ill-fated Majestic. Both games deliver a mysterious plot, and both games blur the line dividing game life and real life. Yet, where Majestic crumbled under the weight of its own ambitions, Missing succeeds as a focused, plot-driven mystery. It's as if the folks behind Missing picked up the pieces from EA's failed project, threw out the faulty parts and then built their own game around the wreckage.    Let's start with the basics. You play Missing as, well, you. A news agency called the SKL Network has lost an employee named Jack Larski and his companion Karen Gijman. They've hired you to help find them. You'll join a small group of amateur detectives in search of a killer calling himself the ~The Phoenix,~ who admits to playing a role in Larski's disappearance. What differentiates ~The Phoenix~ from other killers is his penchant for using technology to toy with those looking for him. He sends the SKL Network a CD with footage taken by Larski prior to his disappearance. But this CD holds far more than a grainy video clip. It's filled with obscure puzzles, clues and arcane symbolism. It becomes clear that ~The Phoenix~ wants you to find him, and the only way to do that is to decipher the cryptic messages imbedded in the CD.    Before you run off and start sleuthing, you'll need to take care of a little business. The game requires a quick registration, in which you'll need to input a username, password and email preferences. Free accounts through Google, MSN, and Yahoo! work just as well as MS Outlook and other such PIM programs. The only drawback here is that you can only use one ID account per game. Tie in this fact with Missing's lack of a manual save option (it saves your progress automatically) and something nasty seems bound to happen. If something tragic occurs, say a glitch or bug prevents you from progressing; you'll need to start a completely new game. Overall, registration is quick and painless. It shouldn't set you back more than a few minutes.       The interface is equally painless and intuitive. Players access a toolbar by clicking on a small icon on the screen. The icon extends to show different tabs, where you can analyze video, watch archived video, access the internet and read email. You can move the toolbar anywhere on the screen. And that's about it concerning Missing's interface.   Missing sets up the story beautifully. The CD that players will insert into their drives is supposed to be one of the few copies of the actual phoenix CD ~mailed~ to you by the SKL Network. The game comes packaged with flyers and documents to help rouse a creepy atmosphere before you even install the game. After the quick registering, you're then off on the hunt. The first thing you'll encounter looks like a one minute clip from the Blair Witch Project. In it, you'll see a frightened women running through an abandoned house fleeing an unseen attacker. She soon reaches a dead end and collapses in terror as the video turns to static. The effect works wonders. The video is believable, well acted and starts the game off on the right foot.    You're soon plunged headfirst into the mystery. You'll need to pass a trial of three simple puzzles before ~The Phoenix~ deems you worthy enough to challenge him. In fact, the first dozen or so puzzles feel excessively simple. I'm sure the developers started easy to coax players into this very odd world of funky puzzles and mysticism, but I don't see why a serial killer would let me progress so easily. And when I say these puzzles are funky, I mean just that. They're strange, creepy and unlike anything I've ever experienced. Admittedly, I had trouble deciding whether such a unique take on puzzles was a good or bad thing. Some of them felt downright gimmicky.    One such puzzle presented a word on the screen, and all you had to do to progress was type the word. Of course, Mr. ~The Phoenix~ has tinkered with your keyboard so every key now correlates with the wrong letter. Another puzzle forced you to push a bunch of letters around the screen so they would fall into sequence, forming a password. Make no mistake, the puzzles all feel and look as they should--creepy as all hell--but the simplicity and absurdity of some only helped break the eerie mood. Initially, the puzzles did appear laughably easy, but the game soon heats up.   Many of the puzzles require you to scour the Internet for clues. After beating each puzzle, for example, ~the Phoenix~ rewards you by presenting video clips of Larski and his companion Karen Gijman (the girl running through the house at the beginning of the game.) You then take some of these clips and analyze them with a program you ~download~ from one of your group members. Careful analysis of these short clips will often reveal a name or address you can use to solve future puzzles. Unfortunately, web crawling gets tedious since search engine results often fluctuate and can obscure Missing's 300 or so real and fictional sites.      As you progress through the game, your fellow group members will stuff your inbox with mail. I counted around 50 during the course of the game. Some of these emails aid the illusion that you're working on a team, while others offer valuable hints and clues. Unfortunately, other emails offer unwelcome, blatant solutions. Not cool. In-game events trigger said emails, but the timing felt a little off. Players shouldn't receive puzzle-busting tips mere minutes after first encountering the puzzle. This didn't happen often, but it spoiled more a few surprises. Later in the game, you'll even recieve email from ~the Phoenix~ himself. All this adds tension and atmosphere; two ingredients needed to propel a game of this sort.   The graphics, while simple, reflect the inner workings of a genuinely twisted mind. While some of it comes off as a little cheap (porcelain dolls anyone?) most of it puts you in the right frame of mind. The game also boasts around 45 minutes of video footage. This is where Missing really shines. The footage looks believable and helps you get attached to the two missing characters. While their dialogue and screen time feels limited, Larski and Gijman come off as real people with genuine personalities. You don't feel like you're watching actors perform, instead, it really feels like you've accidentally stumbled upon a home movie. Those of you with voyeuristic tendencies will definitely love it.   In the end, what Missing: Since January builds is an odd construct of puzzles and clues, of ancient mysticism and modern game mechanics. It's Nancy Drew turned cyberpunk. You'll ditch the oversized magnifying glass and solve crimes through the internet and through emails. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it really works. At its best, Missing makes you feel like an amateur investigator on the trail of a psychotic killer. At its worst, Missing comes off as a second-rate thriller with gimmicky puzzles. It's a good thing then, that Missing mostly comes off as a genuinely creepy murder mystery unafraid to try something new.", "date": "Jul 13, 2004"}
