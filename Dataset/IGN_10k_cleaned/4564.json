{"name": "Onimusha Blade Warriors", "name_review": "Onimusha Blade Warriors", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/18/onimusha-blade-warriors-2", "text": "If you were to look at three of Capcom's most popular games, the Resident Evil, Onimusha and Devil May Cry series, one could decipher an interesting lineage from the first to the last. Resident Evil is just as infamous as it is famous for its set cameras and awkward controls, of which, to a certain degree, the succeeding games retain those characteristics. Onimusha breaks from the strict adventure framework set up with the survival-horror game, giving characters faster movement and gamers more precision control. But there are still set cameras and the game seems to rely on the general formula of the former series. Devil My Cry also retains set cameras, but it breaks far freer of the Resident Evil bonds, giving players a dynamic sense of action and combat.    Sowhat does this have to do with Onimusha Blade Warriors? Very little. Unless you want to count that it doesn't use still camera angles. In all seriousness, Onimusha Blade Warriors is kind of a lark for Capcom, a break from all three of the core action-adventure titles in the trilogy. Yet it's ground in the very essence of the Onimusha franchise. So, what is this strange little hybrid project? The best way to describe it is if you grabbed the fighting formula of Nintendo's Smash Brothers action-fighter, blended in a little of PowerStone's collection scheme and set the whole thing in a Onimusha universe, you'd have Onimusha Blade Warriors. How is it? It's better than average. It's not the deepest fighter on the block, and it's short on story, but it's got a huge surfeit of little bonuses, tons of replay value and multiplayer goodness to boot.   Gameplay  What's neat about Capcom's newest fighter is it's set in the Onimusha universe, it's easy to pick up and play, and, if you've followed the series (the two on PS2 and the port on Xbox), you'll not only feel right at home with the control scheme but the litany of characters, items and surroundings, too. It wouldn't be wrong to call this a side project by any means, and like I said earlier, it's a bit of a lark, but where it's deep is in the collection of things and building of characters. Similar to the great depth that Namco has sunk into its Tekken and Soul Blade/Edge/Calibur series, this hybrid action/fighting game gives players reason to search out and collect stuff, and to grow their characters (the latter of which is lacking in Nintendo's same-style Smash Brothers).    The game is very spare in presentation, including the amount of modes, which include Story, Vs. Mode, Custom Vs., and Tutorial. The opening movie is about as fancy as the game's presentation gets -- which is to say, not very. Story mode follows the paths of 12 initial playable characters. By beating the game with a different character, players unlock special things, ranging from new playable fighters to locations. [SPOILER] For instance, by beating the game with Samanosuke Akechi, players unlock the playable character MegaMan EXE; while if they finish the game as Kaede, they unlock a new location. There are about 12 unlockable characters and eight unlockable backgrounds in all. It's this kind of repetitive yet compelling collecting and unlocking that generate most of the single-player fun.   Vs. Mode is just as significant as Story mode but in a different way. If in Story mode you build up characters and collect items, in Vs. Mode you test your mettle against human opponents. While Capcom's action-fighter isn't deep with fighting moves, it does require skill, the kind that involves timing, knowledge of special moves and items, and the ability to remain evasive in a crunch. Once through the Story mode a few times, Vs. mode gives players the chance to fight toe-to-toe with a second human or two others, making it a foursome, using the PS2 Multitap. There is a little smidgeon on slowdown in Multiplayer, but it almost seems purposeful since it occurs specifically when special moves are enacted. If you don't have three others around, the option to use computer AI is there, with a moderately healthy set of settings to configure your game.      The fighting scheme is overly simple. Press Square to attack, press it multiple times for combos. Triangle is for kicking, which stuns enemies momentarily, L1 is block, and X is jump. A few modifications, however, spice the fights up a bit. R1 acts like a targeting button, so, players can hone in on the nearest enemy and by using it smartly, players can zip behind them for surprise attacks. There are special attacks, too, based on the swords from the series proper. Players can enact wind, fire and lightning attacks for multiple enemies and for bosses. Circle collects souls, while the Dpad is used for moving from plane to plane. There is occasionally some annoyance with plane jumping, you know, darting from the foreground to the background, either because it's sometimes hard to know which chest lies on what plane, and sometimes, it's hard to notice the difference between a double tap and a tap and a half. Also, collecting items quickly is not efficient enough; players really should be able to simply roll over an item to automatically pick it up.    Custom Vs. is only slightly different than Vs. mode. Custom Vs. mode gives players who have sunk a heavy amount of time building their characters in Story mode the chance to use their fortified fighter against other humans. This advantage isn't all that fair against newbies, but for those folks who have friends who've also spend significant amounts of time in Story mode, it's a real plus. And again for what it's worth, you won't find this feature in Smash Brothers.   For fans of the series, Capcom has remained true to Inafune's trilogy, so players can do almost everything they could in the progressive character building scheme of those games here. Each character collects Souls and Victory Souls, which accumulate into building a character's powers; they also provide buying power in the game's ~shop.~ Players can deposit Soul power into attack, defense and magic categories, bolstering their specific character attributes and their player level too. It works in the same way as the Onimusha games proper, so you see the brightly colored power from one meter feeding into the next meter, showing how much is required to reach the next level.    In the midst of fighting characters in the very brief 10-level Story mode (replete with three bosses and varying level requirements), players are meant to gather Souls and to check constantly appearing chests and to collect the contents therein. The items are usually temporary, such as one-time spells, guns, umbrellas, bats, star wands (there is some wacky stuff here, it's true), and more. But occasionally, you'll find a new knife or sword. Collect these and you're in the money. The swords remain with you throughout the game. The same goes for items, though those are much harder to find.     Just like in the Onimusha series proper, the strange old man who hangs from the ceiling appears in Onimusha Blade Warriors. He might appear in your game once to offer the chance to play in the Phantom level, the equivalent to a Survival mode. In it, players fight through as many levels as possible, collecting as many souls and items as possible without dying. Once defeated, players keep their goods, adding them to their stockpile. The old freaky dude with the long mustache also appears after players beat the game, giving them a stockpile of items to buy with their Souls. Items in said store include herbs, Talisman, swords, and the like. The swords cost a lot of Souls, so players will have to play through half a dozen times before earning enough to acquire them.    If the fighting scheme's simplicity bothers you some, don't be too hard on it, it's quite like the system from the games in the trilogy. However, do not make the mistake of thinking this title will enlighten you with hidden story tidbits and treasures of untold factoid depth. Onimusha Blade Warriors is almost entirely void on story, revealing nothing significant about the trilogy, failing to bridge story gaps or reveal anything vital to character development, and it simply comes up blank when you finish it. In that way, it's a disappointment. Not a huge one, because Capcom never promised too much, but there really is nothing of value here in the story department.      Perfect example: When you complete the game as a warrior, [SPOILER] you get a screen of text and evil laughter, and a similar screen of text if you choose a demon (sans evil laughter). The credits then roll. That's it. If this game was a little deeper in the story department, as in if it moved from the shallow end of the pool to say, anywhere else, and told something more specific about what happened to, say, Samanosuke or Kaede after Omimusha Warlords and before Omimusha: Samurai's Destiny, fans of the series would have been better served. There are so many loose ends that this game could have tied up, it's just a bummer nothing materialized.    Graphics  Onimusha Blade Warriors is a decent looking game, giving fans of the series a workmanlike yet colorful set of backgrounds and accurate, detailed looking character models on which to lay their eyes. The backgrounds are drawn from previous titles, including recognizable areas such as the mystic forests, mountain bridges and a handful of temples. By beating the game with various characters and on different difficulty settings, players open up secondary and tertiary levels, all of which add up to lots of minor rewards.    Blade Warriors is consistent with the Onimusha series, which is good for long-term fans, and the generally average textures are coupled with the same great lighting effects and particles systems from the first two games. Overall, however, the game doesn't improve or add anything better or different than those first two games, and the final production quality isn't nearly as good, giving it a slightly hurried feeling.    Sound  The sound is quite simple to criticize. The inconsistent voice acting from the first two games hits a nice, even low quality in Blade Warriors. The voices sound awkward, but to be fair, the voice actors have very little to work with, so it's not all their fault. The lack of any kind of lip synchronization between the voices and the mouths is also disappointing.     It would have been nice to drop the American voice acting in favor for straight Japanese voices, but that option isn't available from the options menu. There is also no option for Dolby Pro Logic II.     Musically, Capcom's fighter fares better. The use of ancient Japanese music, heavy on the drums and flutes creates an eerie raw feeling, while the overall scope of the music reaches that of Japanese samurai movies. The production isn't quite as good, mind you, but the music in general provides that spare combination of thumping rhythmic drums and high pitched pipes, creating a pleasant aural setting.Capcom's hybrid fighter best serves as an interim project that essentially gives Onimusha fans something to sink their teeth into while theyre waiting for Onimusha 3 Demon Siege when it hits shelves in May. The game isn't a standard fighting game by any means, but acts more as an action-fighter along the lines of Nintendo's Smash Brothers and Capcom's own PowerStone. Will you like it? If you approach Blade Warriors lightly, with a grain of salt, with few expectations, then you'll be happily surprised. It was not designed to be a hefty action-adventure game like the first two Onimusha games. And it's super, super short the first time through. You can beat the game with one fighter in 15 minutes. But it's silly, even wrong to think of the game in that context. You can also beat Tekken Tag Tournament and Soul Calibur in about 15 minutes the first time through, too. You're meant to dig in, play it again and again, forage for new items and weapons, open up cool new (or old characters), and have a party with your friends in Vs. mode using the Multitap. In that light, I think you'll enjoy Blade Warriors in all its replay-heavy, smash-button glory.", "date": "Mar 18, 2004"}
