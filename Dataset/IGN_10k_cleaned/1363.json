What was once a rather basic fighting game, a la Street Fighter, Dynasty Warriors 2 now brings players into the once simulated fights so reminiscent of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and surrounds them with the fancies and horrors of fully 3D ancient war, complete with hundreds of warriors, cavalry, strategically superior enemy fortresses, and magical opponent forces. And when more than 30 lusciously designed ancient warriors trundle onto the field and clash in hand to hand combat with no slowdown, it's quite a thrill.  Gameplay Dynasty Warriors 2 is a blend of strangely conflicting elements that work out well in the end for the gamer. Players take on the role of one of nine initial warriors, and are able to play as many as 28 in the end when every level one of the four large missions is beaten. The gameplay involves you taking control of a massive set of ground troops that must confront a similar sized army of foot soldiers, generals, and their leaders. Your soldiers are programmed to fight on their own, but will follow you, once you have initiated a fight, or opened a new doorway, or cleared a path for them to follow. They are passive, but they stay in groups and fight quite well on their own. If you lead, they will follow.  The strange part comes in the high level of beauty and almost low level of actual interactivity required to play. There is the fantastical set up of old world China -- the historically accurate costumes, the elaborately detailed faces, bodies, and surprisingly smooth movement of each character, the impressive mix of beautiful and barren landscapes, and the gorgeous particle system, all of which conflict with the relatively simply gameplay aspects.    Dynasty Warriors 2, in essence, is a straight forward beat-'em up, a hack and slash romp through the war fields of old, with a little bit of strategy and war tactics thrown in for good measure. It all takes place in realtime, and in full 3D, and it's quite a sight to see. Depending on which character you like, each part of their own clans, the Wei, Wu, or Shu Kingdoms, players get to play one of nine initial characters each of whom has their own different weapon and special super moves. The perform simple attacks, multiple hit attacks, or special energized super attacks, becoming more complex and more devastating to the enemy.  The moves are rather simple to administer but they're sophisticated looking. The L1 button is used for defense and shifting and there is also a ~musou~ attack, which you unleash once the musou meter is full. This attack is absolutely beautiful, and it's awesome to watch because it takes out so many enemies at once. The idea is that once surrounded by enemies, you unleash this wide-ranging 360-degree attack, and it wounds, kills or stuns up to 10-15 enemies at once. A magical swath of light follows the weapon as it cuts through the air, and as it hits enemies, beads of light and energy curl and splash off. Needless to say, it's a gorgeous effect that must be seen in action to fully appreciate.  Other more unique actions bring a little more diversity into the fighting fray. All characters have charge moves, as well as the ability to mount a horse and gallop through dozens of enemies hacking and bashing along the way. Using the horse provides you with a great advantage most of the time, and it enables you to cover quite a distance, which helps to open up new enemy lines. Riding a horse, however, isn't all great, because you'll eventually meet up with enemies who won't budge, and who knock you clear off the steed. It's kind of embarrassing to be knocked off your horse, to be honest.     Another good ability is the use of a bow and arrow. By pressing one of the shoulder buttons, players can use the long-range bow and arrow, which brings them into a first-person perspective, to pick off enemies at higher stories, or at a distance. It's somewhat useful, although perhaps not effective in close quarters.  Players also take quite a bit of damage from the more powerful enemies, and can find power-ups along the way to combat death. After cracking lots of enemy skulls, little garlic bulbs pop up to replenish ~life;~ shields, axes, swords, and other power-ups appear after defeating enemies, too. Many of these provide you with about 20-30 seconds of 2X power, or enabling full recovery, or even create invulnerability for a spell. They are almost all very useful.  Another atypical characteristic in Dynasty Warriors 2 is the ability to sway your troops' morale. Depending on your specific performance, you'll either charge their morale, or lower it. The better and smarter you fight the better your troops fight, etc., etc. It's quite interesting, and it can sway back and forth. Perhaps that's where the slightly more complicated strategy in Dynasty Warriors 2 comes in. After the first level, you simply can't charge into battle without taking phenomenal damage. You have to pick and choose battles, carefully avoiding generals and lieutenants when necessary and staying close to your troops when your life meter is low. The strategy really is to know when to run, hide or to attack. Koei also claims that there is actually a full square kilometer to traverse within the game, and after traversing through just one level, it's easy to believe. By pushing the R2 button, you can switch to a zoomed-in map, with each side shown in either red or blue, clearly identifying the sides.  The actual strategy is quite subdued. Most of the time, you'll simply charge in and take out 30 guys (a running total displays how many enemies you kill, and at the end of any average level it could range from 300-500!), and on your way you'll reach a certain passage. The strategies and tactics involved are more about conserving energy, however, than using actual war tactics and strategies. For instance, in one passage you'll have to run through a steep, narrow path as a powerful general magically hurls boulders onto you, your troops, and his troops. Clearly, you need to get past this, or find a different path. In another case, you may encounter a sub-boss who's just more powerful than you -- and is surrounded by powerful troops. You will die in a New York second if you try to take him on yourself. But if you attack with a troop of 25 soldiers, you have much better chances.    Graphics Dynasty Warriors 2 is an amazingly beautiful game in nearly every aspect. The powerful PS2 engine performs some techniques that no other game has achieved to date. First and foremost, it enables more than 30-plus characters to appear on screen in full armor (complete with complex, ancient Chinese dragons, flowers, and a broad palette of bright colors) to fight on-screen at once without slowdown. It enables players to see some beautiful action as well, rarely if ever executed with such moving camera angles and grace. When you pull off a special move, the camera will switch from the third-person perspective to a slowly panning angle that catches your attack with the perfect views.  The special effects, which include the spectacular use of the powerful particle engine and great lighting, among others, are superb. Again, this game is stunning visually. Koei also demonstrates its early mastery of the in-game engine with many cut-scenes and story-telling devices that keep the missions moving. Each time a boss, sub-boss or ~greater evil~ appears, or when a new passage is opened, a cut-scene shows what's happening without breaking up the action in any noticeable fashion.     Last but not least is the first part of the game you see, which is the introductory movie. Koei did an absolutely stellar job of depicting the power of the PS2 with outstanding FMV that blends magic and war, and the pure artistry of Chinese regalia to a forefront with this early film. It's nice to see the PS2 being used well here.  Sound Perhaps the strangest parts of Dynasty Warriors 2 is the heavy metal guitar that drowns out any sense of ancient Chinese war atmosphere. It's sort of like asking Eddie Van Halen to score Shogun ? it's quite odd. But to be fair, since this game is mostly pure action, the grinding heavy metal seems to somehow feel somewhat in place. I guess it shows how simple the average gamers' musical taste is. I mean, I suppose most gamers would prefer this over ancient Chinese music, which even to me is hard to swallow for more than an hour. Then again, now that I think about this guitar playing, it reminds me of the Sonic Adventure music. Hmm... is this just too hard to call? I don't think so, somehow there could have been a better compromise, or even a mix old and new musical styles.  As for the sound effects, we are lucky that Koei recorded so many different kinds of pain sounds. And though the sounds of guys dying eventually grow repetitive, it could have been much, much worse. A neat aspect that you need to listen carefully for is the roar of the crowd, the cheer of a new victory, all of which were executed wonderfully. Additionally, you'll hear the sort of white noise chants of war in the background, yells, chants, hollers, all creating a wave of humans in the act of war. In some strange way, despite its simple core, Dynasty Warriors 2 is very appealing to me. It's partly the scope and the sheer amount of people on screen, and maybe it's that equestrian stuff...I don't know. It's a great game despite its limitations, but I just wish that after three levels I wasn't bored to tears smashing the same set of buttons over and over. But if you want to see some awesome graphics, well take a look at this game. It's simply gorgeous.", "date": "Oct 23, 2000"}
