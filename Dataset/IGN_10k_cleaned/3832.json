And what exactly is Svea Rike, anyway?   If you guessed that it was a film by Ingmar Bergman, you were close, but receive no prize. (Sorry.) ~Svea Rike~ literally means ~The Kingdom of Sweden.~ It is also the name of an historically-oriented strategy game created by Dan Glimne and Henrik Strandberg, that was incredibly popular in Sweden back in 1997. Svea Rike II followed in 1999, and Svea Rike III the year after that.   As it happens, Svea Rike III was translated into English, and became...yes, you're right: CotN. The English title may be a bit more diplomatic, though, since the kingdom of Sweden that its Swedish developers refer to was the late thirteenth century model that subsumed Norway, Denmark, and portions of Finland, Germany, Poland, etc. In truth, it was a good time to be alive in the frozen north of Europe, if you enjoyed ABBA.   A Brief Historical Note  CotN is a game with a single scenario, set in Scandinavia from 1275 to 1340 AC. This was a pivotal period in the political history of the region. At its beginning, Sweden was a sprawling power that had almost too much at its disposal: too many resources, plenty of territory, and too much power in the hands of an absolutist monarch who had (of course) too many sons upon whom to devolve a single throne. Norway was relatively feeble; Germany was actually a bunch of separate nations, each with its own traditions and ambitions. Denmark, a natural counterweight to Sweden, was on the way down. Under Valdemar II, it had been accounted one of the strongest nations in Europe, but his three incompetent sons and their equally sordid offspring were bleeding the inhabitants dry, mortgaging their lands, and throwing armies at one another and everybody else. By the mid-14th century Denmark had almost vanished as a nation, like several other countries which were submerged beneath the tide of cynical diplomacy and endless warfare characterizing the period.   The territory you examine at the beginning of CotN, then, is poised on a precipice. Denmark is still wealthy, but much of its territory has already been lost, sold, or annexed by agreement to various rulers and their noble tenants. Three of the competing factions seeking control of the entire region are sons of Magnus Ladulas, King of Sweden. A fourth is Stig Andersson, proud scion of an ancient Danish family, who detested the high and mighty manner of Valdemar's successors and the way they trampled on Danish law and custom. A fifth is the current Danish king, Erik Menved, who in real life was detested for selling his birthright and pillaging the defenseless. The sixth contender, Haakon, was a younger son of the Norwegian royal family, and owned a duchy in Denmark. (By Renaissance logic, this was cause enough to claim a foreign throne. The English ruling family of the Tudors used it years later in trying to claim all of France.) There is no attempt at equivalency among these factions in CotN; the inequalities among rivals is part of the challenge. As is usually the case in PE's strategic games, each side is rated up-front for economy, military, geographical location, and overall difficulty.   Features, Or Lack of Same  The first thing to note is that CotN looks a lot like Europa Universalis, with a closer-to-ground isometric view that makes Scandinavia seem as large as the world (which, of course, it is). Unfortunately, the visuals and pace of play are the closest tie between the two games, since CotN was developed separately. Most of the features that EU enthusiasts rejoice in are not available. For instance, you can create alliances in CotN, but they're just the usual, bland, mutual defensive and offensive pacts found in many other strategy titles. Missing are the distinctive EU alliances, where each one had a specific objective and timeframe, created by a single national leader who could arrange complex peace deals with the enemy benefiting differently every nation in his pact. (You could also opt out of an alliance in EU, cutting your own deal with an enemy at any time, though this risked angering your allies who might take reprisal measures.) You can declare war on another province's ruler, invite them to join a one-on-one alliance, propose a marriage between your houses, give a gift or insult them in CotN. But the EU games provide so many more tools for diplomatic interaction, in addition to the above: a ban from your alliances, requests for military access (to pass through another ruler's territory), three different levels of gifts, two different levels of insults, claims to another's territory (see the note about the greedy Tudors, above), and guarantees of protection against third-party invasions.   There's literally no trade in CotN, as opposed to the embargos, one-on-one trade agreements, loans, bankruptcies, inflation, twenty resource types, and competing merchants in EU2. This is too bad, because it would have fit perfectly into a game about Scandinavia during this time. It was a period that witnessed the first major wars for resource-related wealth in Europe since the implosion of the Roman Empire, and the enormous covert political role-played by the wealthy burghers of the powerful Hansa conglomerate (the first early modern ~mega-corporation~).    With so much less to offer than EU2 on the diplomatic and trade front, CotN does not compensate through significantly added strategic elements in battle. You can recruit generic Knights, Squires, Crossbowmen, Landsknechten and Foot Soldiers, each with their own strengths, costs and weaknesses relating to terrain, but there's no actual deployment during combat. All your units stack and attack as one, against an opponent's stack. I can accept this in EU2 just as I can in Civilization III or Alpha Centauri, because combat is only one game system among many that demands my regular attention. With diplomacy negligible and trade gone, however, I'm less inclined to settle for such impoverished combat options in CotN.   Then when you get involved in a war, you better keep a pen and paper handy to track your enemies. CotN doesn't do that for you. There are no colored overlay maps displaying the state of your relationships with the 61 provinces and dozens of powers (yes, dozens, though only six have pretensions to rule), as there are in EU2, nor even an in-game list of enemies and another of alliances. If you forget who's who, you'll have to scroll over every inch of the map, checking the diplomatic status icon of each ruler: a real timewaster.   Gameplay  By now you might be thinking, ~By the Gods, thanks, Brenesal! I really appreciate you telling us what the game lacks before you tell us what it really has. May you rot in Niflheim!~ I've structured my review this way, however, because of how the game is being sold. If you look at the box on a store shelf, you'll see the title as Europa Universalis/Crown of the North. The front cover adds in a gold circle for emphasis, Includes EU2 With Three All New Campaigns. It's never stated that the game is part of the EU series, but this presentation certainly lends itself to being misconstrued. I hope I've shown that if you buy CotN thinking it was an EU or EU2 expansion, you'd be sorely disappointed. It's not a terrible game in its own right, but it's substantially different from the EU games, and doesn't begin to approach their depth or variety.   Like EU, CotN runs in controllable realtime. You can slow the pace to a crawl and even pause it, allowing full entry of commands. Most of the game is spent upgrading each of a given province's seven buildings (such as the Church or the Market; doing so eventually yields distinct bonuses), churning out troops and ships, and sending your armies and navies off to battle some enemy. The 2D graphics aren't earthshaking, but they're pleasant-looking and serve their appointed purpose.   CotN adds strategic gameplay through a system of four ~classes~ that represent the way your clergy, nobility, peasants, and burghers think of you. You begin any game with all four rated at 5/6, in a scale of 1-10. Higher numbers are better. Very favorable ratings with the peasants means more food for your people, for example, while the same thumbs-up from your burghers translates into more trade income. Various random events that popup during the game let you change these, providing improved or mixed results in exchange for gold. Cheaper options are worse and can lead to lowered class ratings, but at any time you can also raise a single class' approval of your regime for free, usually at the cost of lowering two others. This system sounds more interesting than it is, however. There's no real negotiation with any of the classes, nor any careful accumulation of resources and shrewd spending of same to reel in gratitude from a given class, as in QSI's 1992 oldie-but-definitely-goodie, Castles II. In addition, the random events referred to above almost always include at least one positive outcome that costs very little. Far from trying to shrewdly balance the classes to avoid rebellion, as the manual suggests, the most difficult path in the game would be arranging not to come out with near prefect relations for all four. You have to work hard to lose at this.   The AI has its problems, as well. In every CotN game I've played, no AI-based enemy I've placed under siege had made any attempt to secure the assistance of other rulers, unless they were already in an alliance. Every besieged province used their tax revenues to create new troops, which takes a lot of time, rather than paying off a neighbor to immediately attack me. (As mentioned above, there's no bribe action in CotN. By ~paying off,~ I mean offering ten or more gifts in quick succession to raise a neighbor's goodwill, then suggesting an alliance. Given the number of years a siege can take, several such alliances stand a good chance of disrupting the plans of an aggressor.)   On the other hand, during some games a distant AI-run province with which I previously had neutral relations would suddenly declare war on me. There's no evidence why, since clicking on the province shows that their opinion of my faction remains neutral. There's no diplomatic option in the game for one faction to demand a neutral declare war; and if I suggest peace, they almost always accept. On those few occasions when my olive branch was quickly turned down, a similar offer made several days later was invariably successful.    You can alter the likelihood of the AI to declare and maintain wars in general through the Aggressiveness setting, and the quality of its decision-making by changing the Difficulty setting for the game. But I found that while cranking up the AI as high as possible made for a moderate challenge from the other factions, it never made a difference where these bizarre declarations of war from far-flung neutrals were concerned. Conversely, if I set the aggression level to maximum, there was a much stronger chance that the various factions would declare war on one another (and me), but it didn't prevent a belligerent neutral from accepting my peace overture within days of taking a combative stance.   Music and sound are problematic in the game. Instead of using the more than four dozen wonderfully atmospheric classical cuts (all taken from records on the excellent BIS label) supplied with EU2, CotN uses the music from the original EU: a few rather neutral tunes that repeat endlessly. Sound effects are comprised of very short, endlessly repetitive loops occurring whenever you click on one of your buildings or troop units. They are all exceedingly annoying, the prize for worst going without question to the troops-at-siege sound: a kind of flame crackle with a weird mechanical shunting noise over it that might represent, for all I know, the action of a ballista. (There are no ballistae in CotN.) The sounds are also at a much higher volume than the music, and there's no adjustment available. I tried turning the music off, but that left the sounds on. When I attempted to restart the music, nothing happened. I was merely left with the continuous sounds effects, along with a primal desire to sob loudly and scream, ~I confess! I confess!~   Translations in CotN are occasionally odd, too. ~You are the only player that may be at an advantage of not getting Knights by the event The Revision of the Hird in Tonsberg in 1278~ is one of the more opaque examples; and there are isolated instances of words or phrases in the game that remain in the original Swedish. Then there are bugs which, since the game's North American version entailed only a translation, must have been around for three years since the original release date without getting fixed. I've found that upgrading a building, saving my game, exiting and reloading allows me to keep the upgrade-in-progress, and start another one. (Only one building upgrade is permitted at a time.) A rather more erratic bug is one that sometimes resets or arbitrarily changes the faction approval ratings when you quit and reload. Games of chance are all well and good, but I don't think this was quite what PE had in mind, here. Shouldn't these problems have been corrected in this game before releasing it for a second time, abroad?   Europa Universalis II & Mods  Along with CotN, this package includes the entire EU2 with its seven lengthy scenarios. My opinion of the original remains unchanged: it furnishes unprecedented depth of gameplay as an historical strategic simulation of worldwide diplomacy, trade and combat. The AI is great, the variety of tools at your disposal to work your will on your people and your enemies are strong, the interface is good and the cumulative impact, addicting. EU2 hasn't left my computer since I first reviewed it early in 2002.   The game has been enhanced in this re-release by three new scenarios created by players. The most interesting of these for novice players will probably be the one called Independent Europe. (It's a very wide Europe that also includes the likes of Kurdistan and Volgograd.) Each province functions as a separate nation, which makes for more than 230 nations in all, and the player can blithely attack these without fear of arousing anger at an unjust war. (The concept of casus belli, a reasonable cause for war, is central to unmodded EU2. If you go to war without having casus belli against another nation, you risk rebellion in your provinces, lowered income, and suffer a loss of reputation in the eyes of your fellow rulers. Launch enough sudden attacks without having just cause for war first, and you may become a pariah leader that other nations unite to destroy.) It's a very tough mod, since all nations are armed, and nobody looks very favorably on anyone else.    EU2 veterans will probably prefer the Alternative Grand Campaign mod. Similar to the 400-year span of the original game's Grand Campaign scenario, this one has significantly different but reasonable events and relationships that alter the currents of military, diplomatic and economic power throughout the world. You won't find England being attacked by Aden; the AGC is subtler than that. But you could end up with a new partner in an alliance, an extra front to a war, the report of an unexpected rebellion or discovery. The AGC is for all those EU2 mavens who have played through the Grand Campaign scenario endless times as the rulers of dozens of nations across the world, and want to regain the thrill of not knowing what comes next.   One item missing from this EU2 re-release might draw a raised eyebrow: the 100-page manual is gone. You can read the extensive documentation from a PDF file installed on your hard drive. Admittedly, the PDF file is a lot easier to view, since that printed manual used small fonts that would have made William Tell reach for his contact lens case. However, there are so many in-depth EU2 rules to absorb that I preferred studying it for hours at my leisure. I don't know about you, but sitting at a computer, reading documentation on screen for lengthy periods of time has never been among the highlights of my variegated life. Print the manual out, you say? Did I pay $39.95 for that privilege?    Curiously enough, Paradox Entertainment literally disavows responsibility for the writing inside the three mods. Or as the readme file that accompanies the game has it, they may hold some grammatical errors such as ~capitalization incoherencies, missing words, text overlapping...~ Come now: if you're releasing a product to the public, the content is your responsibility, whether you like it or not. Feel like not bothering to spell-check a player scenario? Fine. Then put it up on your website as a freebie. Want to charge for the result? Then expect to get criticized if it doesn't live up to the standards any nation has a right to expect when a game is translated into their native tongue.   And these problems do exist, with run-on sentences, proper nouns without capitals, nouns used as verbs, etc. There are also some mod anomalies that aren't exactly grammatical errors. In fact, I'm not sure how you'd describe them. If you want to play Rome in the AGC mod, for instance, it's listed on the pull-down nation selection screen as ~Rebel Scum.~ Before you ask, I strongly doubt Rebel Scum was some name the Romans had chosen for themselves in an alternative special event. Fortunately, the country reverts back to Rome once you've made your choice and entered the historical scenario; but it's an interesting sample of what Paradox should have corrected before it touched down on our shores.For $39.95, you get CotN, EU2, and three players mods of the latter. Such a deal, right? How can you resist? But I hope I've shown that the bargain is only skin-deep. CotN isn't a bad game so much as it is a bland one, lacking distinguishing features. Most of the diplomatic and trade options provided in EU and EU2 simply aren't there. It's also an awkward game to play, since there are neither map overlays nor lists displaying whom you're allies and enemies are at any given moment, out of 61 provinces and more than four dozen province rulers. The AI is quirky, the sound is awful, the music is repetitive, and the translations occasionally leave something to be desired...though not quite everything ended up translated. But your cash also brings you EU2 plus three interesting mods, correct? True, except that you have to make do without the convenient, printed manual that accompanied the original release of EU2. As for the mods: you can download them (and more than a dozen others) for free from Paradox Entertainment's EU2 forums. Just go to the ~Usermade scenarios and mods~ area of their website.That original EU2 release, including the manual, is currently going for $19.99. Recently manufacture of it has been discontinued, but Strategy First is considering a reprint in a standalone jewel case. From a personal perspective, I would urge any fan of 4X strategy titles with in-depth play to buy that original EU2 release now. The game contains a wealth of interesting diplomatic and trade options, some of them (like the different slant on alliances and casus belli referred to, above) unique to this series. It supplies excellent AI, endless replayability, several well-balanced research trees, multiple levels of difficulty, dozens of nations to represent, and seven complex, lengthy scenarios. There's no cheating by the computer; no extra units, extra hit points, sums of money or special abilities going to AI-run opponents, as it is in some celebrated series we could name. If you win an EU2 game against the computer with the AI cranked up, you can pat yourself on the back for a good job done. And even if you don't win, you'll have some damn good fun, trying.", "date": "Aug 7, 2003"}
