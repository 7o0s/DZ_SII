No guns, no exaggerated body parts, and only four fingers.  Glover is an incredibly unique puzzler (OK, OK ... it does owe a little to Marble Madness) that features excellent level design, rich graphics, and addictive gameplay.  Glover's storyline goes something like this ...  A chunky wizard is blending a particularly volatile potion one day and, through his careless actions, the mixture explodes.  In the confusion, the wizard tosses his magical gloves into the air (good thing it wasn't his cookies).  Glover lands safely outside of the castle, but his brother Cross-Stitch lands in a cauldron filled with evil juice.  The kingdom's power source, a collection of crystalline balls, also flew out of the castle tower and are spread around the landscape.  Hilarity ensues as ... wait a second, now this is starting to sound like a wacky sitcom on ABC.  Your ultimate goal in Glover is to retrieve the crystals and bring them back to the castle.  With his built in tracking sense, Glover can locate the crystals with a tap of a button.  He'll point to them, you just have to get him there.  When you do find a crystal, Glover will cradle it and roll it.  Being a magical glove, he (she? it?) can transform the balls into four different types: a bouncy rubber ball, a bowling ball, a ball bearing, and a crystal.  Each ball has its own unique characteristics.  For example, the rubber ball floats and Glover can ride on top of it across huge expanses of water.  Glover can also dribble the rubber ball and use it for extended jumps.  Although difficult to push, the bowling ball can be used to smash jars for hidden power-ups and it can also be used to crush enemies.  The metal ball bearing is attracted to magnets, which comes in handy in a few of the levels.  The crystal form gives you double points when you pick up magic cards (get 50 and you receive an extra Glover), but it is very fragile and tossing it around means certain breakage.  There's also an assortment of hidden balls, but I won't ruin the secrets of the game by telling you about any of them ... you'll just have to find them yourself.  Glover's got a slew of useful moves up his sleeve ... er, at his fingertips.  He can jump, do a cartwheel, ball up into a fist, climb walls, and crawl.  You would think with just a glove and a ball the gameplay would pretty much be the same throughout each level.  Well, this isn't the case.  Different situations will require the use of different balls, so this adds a lot of variety to the game.  The controls do take a little getting used to (especially when you're riding the rubber ball in the water), but after you do you'll be able to move the balls around with amazing precision.  The graphics in Glover are extremely colorful and there's a lot of eye candy here.  The textures aren't incredibly detailed, but the levels do look different from one another and the level design leaves nothing to be desired.  Glover includes 6 different worlds and 30 levels of gameplay.  There are even boss levels (the bosses are usually controlled by Cross-Stitch, whose trying to prevent you from collecting the power crystals) where gameplay does change a bit.  For instance, there is one boss level where you take control of a giant machine and shoot balls at the boss character.     Glover is one of those rare games that comes along and really surprises you.  It's cute, it's non-violent, and it's actually fun.  Unless you just can't stand games where you're not blowing the hell out of anything and everything that moves, you'll definitely enjoy Glover.  I give this one two thumbs up.  -- Tal Blevins Overall, Glover is a gaming experience that anyone could do without. There isn't one individual element that brings the whole thing down, it's a collaborative effort. There are a few good ideas present, but the makers didn't play them well, so we end up with a final product that just isn't fun or rewarding to play. I'll leave it up to the obvious. Mediocre gameplay + Bad graphics = Bad game. If you're curious, give it a rental -- But definitely don't plunk down a few dozen Washingtons for it. Money like that would be better spent on something with purpose, like many pounds of cheese.", "date": "Dec 12, 1998"}
