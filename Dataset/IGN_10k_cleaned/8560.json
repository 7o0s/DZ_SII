I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.~  Matthew 10:34, New International Version. Jesus' words in that passage have been controversial over the years. Receiving a wide variety of interpretations, his reference to taking up arms has been a cornerstone of debates on warfare and violence for centuries. But what if it was just taken completely literally, just for fun? What if God decided, just for kicks, to come down to planet Earth, pick up a keen-edged vorpal blade, and go to town hacking and slashing up demons and monsters? Enter ActRaiser, a game where the story is exactly that.   God is you, the player, in the world of ActRaiser, and the tale begins with your awakening from a sleep of thousands of years, only to find that the land below has been taken over by evil forces while you were off and snoozing. Now, surveying the continents from your floating palace in the sky, you'll have to locate scattered sources of monster infestation and descend from the clouds in human form, entering into side-scrolling action/platformer stages to take up your sword against the legions of The Evil One.        ActRaiser's weapon-wielding, platform-jumping sequences are pretty straightforward stuff. You run, leap and slash your way through forests, caves and castles filled with enemies. You gather apples to refill your life meter, and 1ups to increase your stock of lives. At the end of each stage, a boss battle against some mythical beast  a minotaur, a sphinx, a centaur. It's all fairly basic fare, and the closest comparison currently available on the Virtual Console would probably be Super Castlevania IV.   But Castlevania never did what ActRaiser does next  after each action stage, the genre and style of gameplay takes a complete shift as the game stops being an action/platformer and turns into, instead, a simulation/God game. You're an omnipotent deity, after all, so you're charged  between platforming levels  to look after your planet's human inhabitants and help them develop their civilizations.   The simulation half of ActRaiser actually ends up being the more enjoyable part of the overall design  it's a streamlined, uncomplicated take on the God genre that plays quickly and fluidly. From a menu, you can direct the citizens below where to focus their efforts in city construction and access weather-control powers like lightning strikes, rainstorms and earthquakes to effect change in the terrain. Simultaneously, you also control a small, angelic avatar flying around in the sky above. The cherub is armed with a bow and arrows, necessary for protecting the villagers from airborne monsters that attack and try to destroy the progress being made below.   The monsters in the simulation stages all spawn out of marked lair points somewhere on the map  sometimes hidden, sometimes out in the open. If you manage to extend your town's urban development one grid square at a time and make it to the square containing a lair, a corps of valiant community volunteers will rise up with pitchforks and homebrewed magic to seal away the spawning point for good. After all the lairs are gone, it's time to wrap up the chapter  the game sends you back into a second side-scrolling action stage to bookend the level.  From the NIV, Genesis 27:40  ~You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.~ ActRaiser's 13 platforming stages let you live by the sword, bringing not peace, but destruction to the forces of The Evil One. And saving you from growing restless, the six genre-shifting town simulation levels. You'll never feel like there's too much action, or too much sim  the unique category clash of side-scrolling and simulation keeps things fresh for hours, giving you a break from each style of design by bouncing back into the other. ActRaiser's an innovative and intriguing blend, and it's definitely worth a download.", "date": "May 31, 2007"}
