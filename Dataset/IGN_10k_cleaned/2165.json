While Okage won't make role-playing gamers conjure up memories of some of the PlayStation greats like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX (or VII and VIII for that matter), it'll likely serve as a nice snack to tide them over a little until the big RPGs start to come out on the PS2 next year.  Gameplay The best part about Okage is that it has a pretty unique feel and does some things that are different than you normally see in the genre. First, the game has some pretty comical dialogue, especially in the first quarter or so of the adventure. The story revolves around a young boy who makes a deal with this demon named Evil King Stan in order to save his sister from some strange disease. As part of the deal, Evil King Stan possesses the kid's shadow and tries to get him to help get rid of these imposter Shadow Kings and eventually take over the world.   And it's with this backdrop that the game's comedy centers on. As the boy talks to people walking around in the world, Stan will pop up and command that the person bows down before his power and so on, but instead of cowering in fear like he'd want them to do, all of the characters sees this as a joke and are jealous of the kid's cool shadow. It's a really simplistic form of humor and won't obviously appeal to everyone, but I definitely got a kick out of it for at least the first few hours of the game.  Herein lies the problem. The game starts out pretty unique and fresh, but it doesn't manage to hold up through the full quest, which will last anywhere from 20-30 hours depending on how fast you're able to blow through RPGs and how much you decide to check walkthroughs and the like. The humor doesn't really evolve much and even tapers off quite a bit later on the game, making Okage nothing more than very average, run-of-the-mill adventure. The battles are pretty mundane and despite the fact that it tries some cool things, such as Stan quizzing you before a fight, where if you get the answer right, he'll help you and if you don't he won't, the battles are overly simplistic and downright boring.  Graphics It's hard to really nail down a score for the graphics, because what you get here in Okage is really mixed. From a technical standpoint, it's not all that good. There's a lot of pop-up, there's a ton of repeating textures in the dungeons and the game's just not pushing a whole lot of polygons. On the other hand, I really dig the visual style of the characters and the world. Despite its technical shortcomings, it's still a very pretty game, with lots of vibrant colors and amazing character design.   Sound What you hear is generally pretty good, as the soundtrack is enjoyable and since there's no character speech, you won't have to worry about putting up with a poor dub. The problem here is that there's simply not enough variety in the game's music, which would've been enough for a game that was six to eight hours, but not for this game that can take upwards of 30 hours. Okage: Shadow King is an enjoyable game that is surely something to consider for PlayStation 2 RPG fans that are surely starved for a traditionally styled console role-playing game, seeing as there aren't really any currently available on the system. But it's by no means a must-have game and while I found it to be pretty humorous, at least at the game's outset, many of you might find that its comedic style is a bit immature and simply not all that funny. Get it if you must have an RPG right now and can't wait for the 2002 and beyond RPGs like Final Fantasy X, Grandia Xtreme, Star Ocean 3, Legaia Duel Saga, Wild Arms 3 and Xenosaga. However, if you're not in a situation where you feel you have to buy and play an RPG, there are better games in other genres out there.", "date": "Oct 15, 2001"}
