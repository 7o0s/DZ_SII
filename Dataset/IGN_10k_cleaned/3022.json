It's a natural evolution. First comes the desire to walk, and then talk, and then finally to wear skimpy outfits and pull equally revealing apparel off other people's tight bodies in mocking delight. But, as high school past and I grew from child to childish adult, I left that craving behind with so many other sinful wants. Now I long to control a Bikini Karate Babe. Don't worry, it's just that wondrous transition from boyhood to abusive and demeaning manhood.  Thank goodness for backyards and low scruples. The combination of the two is what's going to deliver me to my ignorant, dominating bliss.   Bikini Karate Babes is a 2D fighter that incorporates FMV characters whom are all bikini wearing women schooled in the fine art of karate, which now involves the coveted laser breast shot, the devastating bosom suffocation maneuver, and the always dreaded gentle ass spank. I'm telling you, it's pronounced kahr-ah-tay.  Exactly like Street Fighter The Movie, Way of the Warrior, and that one part of Demolition Man on the 3DO, this FMV endowed fighter comes with a single terrific aspect and then a whole bunch of horrible. That singular, shining, pervasive joy stems from the fact that you never, ever have to play it. Buying Bikini Karate Babes requires a trip to the official website. Since I don't think the game has passed through Wal-Mart's rigorous approval process, even seeing it at the store and somehow becoming distance tainted is not a problem for the unwilling. And the horribleness? Oh, that's everything else, except sweet, sweet Mira Popova, of course.  Mira is that ray of sunlight that glistens off an otherwise demented, halfcocked, polluted sea of an idea spawned from the simple intent of trying to ~wrangle up them local girls at the bar and gits 'em to jiggle.~ She plays the role of Aphrodite, the end boss in the game's equivalent of a story mode. I say equivalent because I'll be damned if I know what the hell is going on. From what I can decipher of the extremely brief cutscenes (compressed into some bizarre Amiga format so that they cannot be viewed without actually sifting through the sewer of a game), some scantily clad women are trying desperately to take over a rather pleasant city park. The girl with the laser shooting nipples (the blasts are yellow, in case you're wondering) is content with shootin' up rocks, while others are trying to spread passion throughout ~the island.~  But all that takes an irrelevant backseat to play, which actually has the uncanny ability to ruin life itself. Your tadpoles will die if you buy this.  And what a challenging, masochistic experience it is. It's not so much the raw difficulty of the demanding AI, which will try and best you by repeatedly kicking and punching like crazy, but rather the way in which you are forced to win that makes it so very hard. Unlike most other acceptable games released in the last twenty or thirty years, victory is all about having superhuman endurance. It's necessary to endure the graphics, the sound, and the control. In this sense, Bikini Karate Babes takes a very hard and real lesson from real kahr-ah-tay. It's clear that with this game the developers purposefully and nobly tried to instill the patience, discipline, and extreme tolerance to pain associated with lifelong training into the not so virtuous hearts of the PC gaming populous. I commend the effort, but in doing so, Bikini Karate Babes was left open to be picked apart by its competition: Dead or Alive 3, NASCAR Racing 2002, Predator on the NES, and the peanut butter cookie from the vending machine.   What we've established to be an intense and dedicated focus on realism ruins the control. Dead or Alive 3 wasn't nearly as realistic as this, clearly. Still, it, NASCAR, the cookie, and Predator all eschewed away from demanding realism in favor of classic gameplay, which worked in their favor.   I know it's a lot to expect a small development house like Cutting Edge Studios to outdo prolific developers such as Tecmo, Data East, 3DO, and Grandma's (famed creator of the immense peanut butter cookie), but characters in those games did stuff when you hit buttons. For instance, in Dead or Alive 3, when you pressed punch, the old guy would punch. In Predator, pressing jump would propel the tiny Arnold high into the air, not enraging you. The peanut butter cookie, when jabbed with a finger, would leave a little depression that told a story something like, ~I'm a soft cookie and you poked me.~ These remarkable advancements in technology seem to have been completely lost here, where the characters more like to not do things than do things.  As an example, trying to get up once you've been knocked down is futile. Unless your player has an available recovery attack, chances are you'll be immediately beaten into the ground again. Blocking has the same ~please stop hitting me~ result. Once you initiate a block, it's nearly impossible to counter out of it and continue the fight. This is a real shame because fighting games these days rely heavily on both adversaries being able to repeatedly and skillfully hit one another. True, you could theoretically pull off more combos with a better response time in the NES classic Renegade, or even an NHL game, but hitting stuff can still be fun here.  The AI compensates for it all. By being deliberately and unfathomably stupid, the computer helps alleviate any burden placed on the user with a stellar automation system.   If you're an adept computer kind of guy comfortable with plugging things in, you can easily setup a controller with a macro (a sequence of keystrokes bound to a single function). Binding one of Bikini Karate Babes' projectile attacks to such a macro is especially handy. Just start up the game, put a small brick on top of the gamepad to keep the button down, leave to do something interesting, and then come back some significant time later and the quest will have been completed. Not forcing players to sit and pay attention to the game in order to beat it is a great, thoughtful plus all developers of horrible games should consider implementing. I'd like to see the peanut butter cookie pull that trick off.  Hey, at least these graphics are fantastic. There are girls and they have girl parts. Sure, they move like freaked out puppets injected with poisoned amphetamines, occasionally reverting to an eerie, frozen state, and they jitter all over the damn place like an epileptic in an anime convention, but a few of them are pretty and exotic. Unless you're a millionaire and also live in the shanty backwoods of Georgia, this will be as close as you'll ever get to such rare and wondrous beauties. In fairness, some of the girls are attractive (seriously), but then I can see other lovely female beings on the street, in school, at work, or likely in an intellectual masterpiece like Extreme Teen #24. Now which one of you plays the part of ~Uncle's Victim #2?~  How dare I degrade these girls in such a way!?! Don't pity them. If a quick buck can get the spunky American to pull a torch out of her crotch, I am entitled to cruelly jest. It's some kind of constitutional right. The good lord gave it to me, just like he blessed Bikini Karate Babes with an awful voice that would kill harpies. Effects not withstanding, the music is actually pretty good as far as techno pornography goes.  When I'm playing NASCAR, I can hear the car, feel the car, and become one with the car. Likewise, the peanut butter cookie softly folds in my mouth, bringing forth salivation -- its wrapper crinkling beneath my frail fingers... I can hear no bikini karate babe, feel no bikini karate babe, become one with no bikini karate babe, or even clutch a bikini karate babe and crinkle her up something fierce. It seems the disheartening, prophetic words of my mother and every girlfriend I've ever had are indeed coming to pass.  Up above I mentioned Way of the Warrior on the 3DO. Make note. Notice how the development team consists of just three guys, not including White Zombie, which didn't exactly program or draw anything.  What did you think of Bikini Karate Babes?  Naughty Dog created that awful 3DO game on three Macintoshes, filmed everything against a big blue tarp and shot it all out of their own apartments, even having to go out in the hall and scare some neighbors to get the angles right. It was an ass of a game, but it was better than this and it's almost a decade old! Go pilfer a 3DO and a copy of WoW from the local, gimmicky ~Future Tech~ shop's dumpster and have a gander. It lacks bikinis and breasts, but it's schway compared to this (I'm allowed one Batman Beyond reference per article).By successfully incorporating every single thing a brawler geared towards boys should have (various breasts), Bikini Karate Babes has rightly propelled itself to the upper echelons of the genre and is now a way better FMV fighter that prominently features bikinis and women than NASCAR 2002 or Combat Flight Simulator 3 will ever be. Aside from the horrible control, mind numbing audio, baffling everything, and complete, unadulterated insanity, this is a terrific game that should be immediately purchased by anyone with a lobotomy or currently in the process of getting a professionally done or self performed lobotomy. Bikini Karate Babes does teach us one thing though... If you have a video camera, a backyard, a terrible idea, and one hundred and twelve dollars to blow, you too can get girls to wear bathing suits and do things, like fight and lie down.Sweet Mira, why oh why have you sunk so low?", "date": "Oct 8, 2002"}
