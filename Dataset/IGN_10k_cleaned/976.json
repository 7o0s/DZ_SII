If a game is fun to play, it can overcome the aural and graphical shortcomings enforced by its time of release, as Konami boldly attempts to prove in this tasty package, the first volume of a continuous series, the success of which hinges largely on the customers' recollections of the classics. I've fond memories of playing the majority of these back when the 8-bit consoles ruled the roost, so this vital element of nostalgia hit me as early on as the selection screen, virtually guaranteeing my enjoyment.   Features: Four games: Gradius, The Castlevania Adventure, Probotector and Konami Racing Variable levels of difficulty.  For Game Boy and Game Boy Color Konami GB Collection Volume 1 is divided into four specific games, the majority of which existed on the Game Boy back in the dominating black and white days. Gradius: Along with R-Type, Gradius (also known as Nemesis) is possibly the most famous of all the classic shoot-'em-ups. A tidy conversion of a wonderful original ensures that this is just as much fun now as it ever was. Enemies fly at you from angles, requiring lightening-fast reactions in manoeuvring around them and blasting whatever gets in your way. You start with a puny little weapon, more appearing when you destroy certain ships. The five stages each conclude with a battle against a screen-filling boss, which look brilliant in their coloured forms and create heated fire-fights, despite having easily predictable attack-patterns. It never gets any more involved than this -- but the polish in the gameplay ensures that, to immerse, it never has to.  The graphics are clear and clean, the first level including some subtle parallax scrolling, which looks rather nifty; and later on, there are some very nice background details. Musically, it's impressive too: the levels each have their own tunes, none of them inane or annoying.  Once powered-up, bullets and lasers hurtling from every angle, your ship is capable of massive amounts of destruction, making Gradius immensely satisfying, even though the large amounts of clones released during the following years means that nothing here will really catch you off-guard.The game isn't brilliant, as it never really catches the player enough to last for extended sessions; but it's perfect for an occasional blast, and definitely a step in the right direction for Konami. The Castlevania Adventure: Forget Alone in the Dark; forget Resident Evil. This is where the horror genre was born, years before parents rose up in arms over unsuitable videogame content.   You play a young lad by the name of Simon Belmont, a resident of Transylvania -- where Count Dracula is again causing trouble. Whilst it would, perhaps, have best been left to Buffy, the game sees you journeying to Dracula's castle in an effort to slay the villainous Count once and for all, fighting an impressive variety of undead menaces along the way. For the most part, the game plays fantastically. It might look like a standard platformer -- but there's a lot more to it: in particular a dark, foreboding atmosphere, enhanced by the detailed, moody backgrounds and the appropriately gothic music. The animation is simplistic, but it does the job well enough, and the broody style is maintained throughout. Simon is armed merely with a whip, which adds beat-'em-up elements into the mix and can be upgraded through powerups collected by destroying the many candles lining each area. Some people might be turned away by the extreme difficulty: play this alongside Castlevania 64, for example, and you'll see how much games have been watered down over the years. The onslaught of enemies is unrelenting -- if you're slow on the trigger, you won't have a chance. The later of the four areas take frustration to new levels, with spiked ceilings bearing down and bosses that barely give you a chance to react before slaughtering you. Unfortunately, the jumping mechanics are somewhat strange and slow, so judging gaps is often difficult; and occasionally, when the screen is full of sprites, immense slowdown occurs. Mostly, though, it is perfectly fair  -- any mistakes are the fault of the player alone -- so it becomes compulsively addictive.   On the whole, this is a fantastic game. If you've ever complained about the lack of decent platformers released as of late, you could do far worse than taking a look at this. Probotector: What was called Contra here was titled Probotector in Europe -- subtle changes were made to the European version (such as going up against robots instead of humanoids), but the game's the same in any territory. There's no real story to sum up here, another early release in a classic, multi-platform series; but seeing this as a criticism would be missing the point somewhat. Aliens have once again invaded the planet, threatening to leave it in ruins; and rather than letting them get on with it and claming billions in insurance, the military send in an experienced, heavily armed soldier to wipe them out. That's you, naturally. The game is split into five levels, three of which are viewed side-on, with the others seen from above. You simply have to get from one end of the level to the other, blasting the persistent waves of soldiers and monsters pouring at you from all sides. One shot will always kill you, and once you've lost three lives, it's game over. The controls are extremely tight and responsive, allowing you to dodge every bullet with skill and panache; as with Castlevania, any deaths are entirely the player's fault -- the screen can be filled with danger, yet escape is always possible thanks to the fast, fluid gameplay: you permanently feel into total control over your character. It's tough, for sure -- but never cheaply so. You genuinely progress a little bit further with every game, making Probotector just as addictive as any new release, the meaty sound effects adding to the pleasure of inflicting copious amounts of carnage. The shoot-'em-up elements are mixed perfectly with platform sections, that fit smoothly in the flow of the game rather than interrupting it. There's scarcely a second to breath here, all five levels wonderfully frantic. Extra weapons, such as the famous spread-gun and a very cool homing-shooter, can be obtained by blasting the pods that periodically fly past. One complaint is that death results in the loss of any interesting weapons, and some sections are virtually impossible with your standard peashooter-calibre rifle.  A direct hit, for sure. Konami Racing: Just when it looks like things can't get any better -- they don't. After the excellence of the last three titles, Konami Racing comes as something of a letdown, its inclusion here questionable.  The game, viewed from above, isn't so much bad as terminally dull. There are three main options: a test run, consisting of just a single race on the track of your choice; a sport-entry, similar to the above, but with other cars; and the main portion of the game, the full-entry, where you compete in a series of races, an overall points-listing deciding the winner.  The problems become apparent just seconds after starting. A sensation of speed is vital to make racers exciting; but here, it's virtually non-existent. Most of the cars move at a crawl, and you have to slow right down for the corners anyway, or else drive straight into the wall. Laughably, there doesn't seem to be a way of reversing either: I had to restart from becoming stuck firmly against the track-edge on a number of occasions. Before racing any other cars, you must first sit through three laps of testing, and -- since there's no save-game -- this has to be done every time you play. Anyone who even manages to reach the game proper without going postal deserves a medal. Graphically, the game is inept: everything is tiny and generic, with no interesting sights to see along the way. The music quickly becomes annoying, and the only real sound effects are the grating of the engine and the occasional thud when you hit something.   This is not a good reason to buy the package. Fortunately for the developers, however, no more are needed. Hence, Konami Racing exists only as a painful reminder than some 'treasures' are best left buried.     The novelty of playing these genuine classics again guarantees this cart's worth in any gamer's collection. But as well as proving that older games can beat the new in a number of vital areas, these are also fantastic in their own right. It's a wonderful example of substance over style, and the one dud fails to drag the overall quality down, as the cart would be just as worthy a purchase if the other three were on their lonesome. As long as the mediocrity of Volume 2 is just a temporary hiccup, this series could go far.Note: Konami GB Collection Vol.1 is currently only available in Europe -- Konami has no plans on bringing this game to the US -- if this game interests you, you might want to look into importing the game -- check your local import house for details.", "date": "Jun 2, 2000"}
