You know, play something that focuses on a time period between the Crusades and the Second World War. Unfortunately, there aren't nearly as many titles dealing with the conflicts of those eras. So when one comes along, you kind of have to bite the bullet and take what you can get. That's pretty much the position I've been in with the previous Cossacks games. Though they had some obvious weaknesses, it was hard to complain simply because there weren't any other developers willing to take on the subject of post-medieval, pre-modern warfare.  That's pretty much the same boat we're in with the latest sequel from GSC, Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars. The game definitely has some interesting ideas and some original touches that are easy to love. But the fact that so few games these days are interested in 19th century battles means that you'll almost have to be more tolerant of the game's weaknesses and shortcomings. Truth be told, if you're in to the warfare of this period (and don't already own Sid Meier's fantastic Antietam), then the things that would discourage you from trying this game out aren't going to seem as important as the fact that it's pretty much the only game in town right now.  But first let's talk about what the game does right. The game's concept of resource management is very refreshing. You'll still use peasants to build things and harvest resources but it's handled in a much more automatic way than before. To begin with, peasants are really only responsible for gathering wood and stone. The other resources of food, gold, coal and iron are gathered at villages located across the map. Each village produces one type of resource and you'll need to secure (at least) one of each if you want to keep your war machine running.  As long as you control those buildings (meaning there are no enemy troops around), it will send those resources to your town center where they can be spent on new buildings, new units or one of a very small number of upgrades. Some resources, like food and gunpowder are even used up by your armies in the field. Let the stock drop too low and you can kiss your victory goodbye. These villages produce their own small garrisons that can hold off enemy attacks for a short time. They can also replenish losses for nearby friendly units. They become great smaller objectives on your way to eliminating your enemy.   The concept of resource management and supply is handled very well here. There's an old adage that says ~Amateurs discuss tactics, professionals discuss logistics.~ Any idiot understands the importance of getting behind an enemy; some of them can even manage to pull it off. But it takes a real genius to figure out how to procure and delivery the supplies to the troops so they can maintain their effectiveness. Happily, the actual concept of supply lines is kind of absent from the game. You will have those caravans that travel from your villages to your town centers but you won't actually have to ferry gunpowder to your men in the field. That part of the game is abstracted for you.  While I've been happy with some of the things that the game leaves out, I really would have liked to have seen a way to prioritize supplies. If you run low on food or gunpowder, the effect is spread throughout your armies. Personally, I could see it being very useful to keep one unit well enough fed to ensure that they could play a key role in, say, defending an important village. I also would have found it useful to push the entirety of my meager gunpowder supplies to a single cannon that's firing on an enemy stronghouse that's the key to the enemy's defense.  This new resource model means that you'll spend less time micromanaging your peasants and more time leading your armies. In fact, given the focus on villages, leading your armies actually becomes a key component of your economy. The way these two areas are connected is one of the best features of Cossacks 2. Happily, the campaign capitalizes on this, giving you plenty of opportunities to grab and protect these resource-producing villages while also outmaneuvering your enemy. On the downside, the campaign itself doesn't really have a great story and the scripted objectives aren't terribly clear.      If you like a less predictable but no less massive undertaking, you can play through the game's Battle for Europe mode. Here you'll select one of six European powers and lead them to victory over your enemies. There are two modes of play here: first you'll have to maneuver your leader's army around a map of Europe, seizing key provinces from your enemies; each move into a new province triggers a tactical battle. It's a somewhat simpler version of what we've seen in the Total War games or in the conquest mode of Rise of Nations. Each province provides a certain resource type that you'll need to increase the size of your army and finance your diplomatic actions. Though this mode is fun as a diversion, you just don't feel like you have enough strategic options open to you at the beginning. That combined with the massive garrisons found in the European capitals ensures that the pace of the game is somewhat tedious for the first several turns.  If you don't have the commitment for the larger game types, there are quite a few skirmish battles that let you try out all the battle features in single missions. You'll need to develop your infrastructure and manufacture and mobilize your armies against a single opponent. I was a little disappointed that there aren't really any cool stat screens  to show you the breakdown of your performance. I was even more disappointed that there's no real editor or random map generator to extend the life of this mode. Finally, if you absolutely hate the economic side of things, there are a small number of historical and speculative battles that have two big armies facing off against each other. There's no resource production here -- it's just one big army crashing into another until one of them cracks.  That point about big armies raises is key to understanding this game. Naturally, the whole character of battle from this period is clearly defined by rows and rows of brightly outfitted infantry marching in crisp lines and thunderous cavalry wedges wheeling about in preparation for charging down an enemy. Cossacks 2 captures the scale and pageantry of these battles very well and manages to make controlling all the action at least somewhat convenient.   Rather than manipulating the hundreds of individual units from the first game, the units in Cossacks 2 are controlled as large, distinct formations. Basic troop types, like musketmen and voltiguers, come in packs of 120. Cavalry formations are capped at 45 units, while more specialized troops like sappers and riflemen come in groups as small as 15 men. It is possible to lead hundreds of individual units around in battle, but the corps creation process is very straightforward and opens up a variety of formation options that helps you better coordinate your soldiers' efforts.  Coordinating their efforts also means understanding the tools at your disposal. Cossacks 2 scores high in this category. There are a wide variety of troop types here, each with a significant role to play on the battlefield. Highlanders, for instance, are great in melee combat but not as good as musketeers when it comes to firing volleys at an enemy. To make things even more complex, the highlanders consume less gunpowder when they fire, opening up an entirely new sense of responsibility in terms of supply management. Do you rely on weaker troops that will conserve resources or do you go for a more decisive troop with the fear that they'll become much less effective if your supplies start to run low?  Even with the authentic troop types and tactical options, Cossacks II doesn't really offer anything that we didn't see five years ago in games like Antietam. There are a few neat additions, such as being able to reserve fire for any of the three ranks in an infantry line. Unfortunately, while this level of control opens up some great tactical options it's pretty cumbersome to manage in real time. In fact, even the management of basic movement and fire orders can start to seem overwhelming when you have more than two or three things going on at once.  Imagine dispatching a force to guard a crossroad and then turning your attention to a more immediate town assault. If the force marching to the crossroads encounters an enemy, they won't take any action whatsoever, even going so far as to try to march through the enemy to get to their objective. Sure the game warns you that your troops have encountered an enemy but when you're managing two fights at once, you'll really start wishing that the friendly AI in Cossacks 2 showed a little more I.      You are able to issue orders while the game is paused and though it makes management a whole lot easier is does tend to spoil the rhythm a bit. Even so, there are some activities, like choosing just the right distance at which to fire at the enemy, that really have to be managed while the game is running. Trying to do this for more than one unit is hard. Trying to do it for units across the map from each other is just impossible. A little toggle to set automatic firing ranges would go a long way towards solving this problem.  The AI seems a bit off in terms of movement and pathfinding as well. Since troops move more quickly and tire less when traveling on roads, it makes sense that your own troops will seek out the most convenient path to their objective. Unfortunately, you sometimes want troops to move across a certain line because it sets them up with a tactically significant approach to an objective. Having them go out of their way to take a new route simply because it has a road means you'll have to babysit them a bit more to get them to do just what you want them to do. Remember, the quickest way is not always the best. It's even more of a pain in the ass when these diversions take your troops into an obviously dangerous situation.  The visuals in Cossacks 2 are the proverbial mixed bag. While I'm not one of those types to complain that a game isn't in 3D, there are those gamers out there who just can't stand sprites. Myself, I don't mind so much. Sure, the units are a little blurry, but they look pretty good overall. With all the different troop types, it'll take you a while to figure out which is which but in the meantime you can enjoy some pretty neat little animations. Watching a line of riflemen reload their muskets or staring while a crew readies their cannon for firing is pretty enjoyable. The environments around them are pretty standard. You'll appreciate the fact that the trees sway in the breeze or the fact that you can actually count the tiles on a building's roof, but there's nothing really jaw-dropping about the game's backgrounds.  The upside to a more traditional presentation is that you ought to be able to have much more going on at once. Cossacks 2 definitely has lots of units on screen at a time but, even on my Alienware machine, I still had some framerate problems and stuttering during the more massive battles.   Lastly, on the visual side, Cossacks 2 plays real footage of Napoleonic reenactors in a small window during the game. The reenactment is synched up with whatever your selected unit it doing at the time and it really helps add to the experience. Sure, it's a bit of a novelty but watching real people fire real muskets and start reloading them gives you a much stronger sense of connection to the events in the game.  I really like the music in this game. It suits the action well. The sound effects are passable but you really don't get a sense of the gravity of battle by listening to the rather skimpy weapon and marching sounds in the game. Having heard a cavalry charge in a game like Rome: Total War I find it hard to believe that Cossacks 2 can't do more to really bring the sounds of battle home to the player. Where Cossacks 2 really fails though, from a standpoint of sound, is in the terrible voice acting. Though the dialogue itself is pretty stilted, the delivery doesn't make it any better. It's even more distracting when the titles on screen don't match what the voice actors are saying. Cossacks 2 is a bit better than the original Cossacks and a substantial improvement over Alexander. At the very least, the time period is much more exciting and much easier for the general gaming general to relate to. The overall presentation level has been improved as well. Though there are definitely some rough edges here and there, this is a much more polished product than other games in the series.The challenge of battle management under a significant time pressure constitutes the whole point of real-time strategy games. On some levels, Cossacks 2 hits a real sweet spot. You don't have to micromanage your peasants and economies and unit production, for instance, which leaves you open to focus on tactical matters. Even so, they're still a very important, very controllable part of the game. That's good design. On the other hand, the tactical side of the game suffers from too many management requirements, particularly in terms of having to tell your troops when to fire and when not to march headfirst into an enemy volley.Hosting both the Napeleonic Wars and the American Civil War, the nineteenth century is an endlessly fascinating period for wargamers. Unfortunately, PC developers have recently shied away from this era in favor of other settings. This makes Cossacks 2 a more attractive prospect than it might seem at first. There are bound to be frustrations here even for the most forgiving grognard but the sad fact is, there's just not that much competition out there.", "date": "Apr 26, 2005"}
