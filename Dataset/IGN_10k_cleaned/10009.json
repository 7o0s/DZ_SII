No offense, but Shadow Madness wasn't the best way for Crave to jump into the RPG market (good game / bad timing). However, with the release of Final Fantasy VII, Suikoden II, Breath of Fire IV, etc. being so far off, Jade Cocoon won't be overshadowed by these already established franchises and is the perfect RPG that will easily suppress that hunger until those games come to US shores. Story Jade Cocoon puts gamers in the shoes of a Levant, a young boy who is following in his late father's footsteps in becoming a cocoon master. Unfortunately, though, his training has been obscured by the Onibubu, a swarm of giant bugs that's invading your home village. With the help of monsters that you capture and tame, your goal is to stop the Onibubu and become a cocoon master. Gameplay What separates Jade Cocoon from most RPGs, if not all, is its in-game battle engine. Granted, the fights are turn-based, but there is so much more going on. For starters, the monster combining elements add so much more to the game. As you progress, you'll encounter, fight and capture (I'll explain in a bit) hundreds of exotic monsters.  The capturing of monsters, or the ~Cocoon~ feature, is essentially what makes this game unlike no other. Through your adventure, with the help of your ocarina, you can capture all sorts of monsters, bring them back to your wife and she'll do one of three things. She can spin the creatures into silk, which can buy weapons, armor and other various items, she can also tame them, and they can join your party, or, if you have a whole bunch of creatures, she can combine them. Genki's monster-combining engine allows you to combine two creatures together. When you combine them, the creatures will take on and drop certain characteristics and abilities (which are elemental based). It's really cool. When you combine one creature with another, say a creature with water strengths and one with fire strengths, the end result is, you have this new and improved creature that now has fire and water abilities. As you gain levels, the creature's abilities will strengthen, and the more you combine them with other creatures, the weirder your pets begin to look. The combinations are literally limitless.  I have to admit, though. The story part, or one player mode, isn't that long. It will take you roughly 15 to 20 hours to beat... max. The replay value in this game comes in the ~Arena~ mode. Much like Pokemon, Jade Cocoon has a two-player mode that allows you to challenge your saved monsters with a friend's. This feature alone adds so much more replay value to the game. Not to spoil it for you, but even after you've finished the game, you can wonder around and find more monsters, tame them, increase their levels, combine them, whatever, and battle them.  It would've been great if Genki had developed the game where all your captured characters could all show up in battle and you could all fight at once. The problem is, when you're playing, you have to switch in and out between you and your captured creatures. This is just personal taste, but the game would've been a lot better if the monsters could join your party and you fought along the side of them, as opposed to just switching in and out between party members. Sound  I must admit, the music in this game is really well done. I found myself sometimes, just sometimes, dozing off and thinking about swimming with pigs, in a pool of lime gravy... sorry, I'm listening to the music as we speak -- let's just say it's really soothing.  If you didn't already know, all the text in Jade Cocoon has voiceover. Now voiceovers can make, or break a game. For Jade Cocoon, the voices definitely make it. Each voice really fits the character. But for those that hate voice over, and just want to read the text in peace, you can turn off the audio and read the text like a traditional RPG.  In fact, the only complaint I had is that damn flute. Every time you try to capture a monster, Levant had to serenade it with the same damn tune. Why couldn't you just bribe him with a Scooby-snack? ~C'mere, c'mere, want some of this? Come on, come to daddy.~ Graphics  I can't even begin to describe how beautiful the game's prerendered backgrounds are. Genki has done an excellent job in creating one of the most uniquely designed environments the PlayStation audience has ever seen -- it's so fresh (not in a northern Californian way, I mean like a... a summer breeze kinda way). Honestly, there really isn't a game out there that's as beautifully designed as this one. It's a nice looking game.   To add, the game's cutscenes are all done with the in-game engine as well, like Metal Gear Solid. The only CG you'll see in the game is at the end... oops, I hope I didn't ruin it for you. Overall  The harsh truth behind Jade Cocoon's beautiful presentation is that there isn't a whole lot of game. It would've been great if Genki had put a little more effort into the one player mode. Again, the game's fine mix of RPG components and monster combining elements make Jade Cocoon a game that is like no other. But hard-core RPGers may feel a little ripped off after finding out the ~story~ mode takes about 15 hours to beat. But in Jade's defense, for those that love Pokemon, and Pokemon-like titles, this one is for you. All in all, it's a fun game, and it's definitely worth the purchase.  -- Jay Boor", "date": "Jul 31, 1999"}
