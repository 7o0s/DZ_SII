As much as gamers like driving fast, they love blowing stuff up even more. Doing both at the same time, though - now there's a winning combination. Take such lovely examples as the original Mario Kart on the SNES or the recent Burnout Revenge. Both titles mix wheels and mayhem to great effect.  The winning combination comes up short in IGPX, a futuristic racer featuring lethal robots on skates. Not that the concept lacks potential. On the contrary, the show on which the game is based draws a huge crowd. Not only that, traveling at 350 miles an hour battling with rival bots definitely has its appeal, even if you're not a fan of the genre. It's just one of those things with high levels of intrinsic appeal to players across the gaming spectrum. Which begs the question: at what point does IGPX lose control and spread its bits all over the raceway?   Not too far into the race, unfortunately. Though all the preparation and pep talk before the race begins delivers the goods. Take the game's aesthetic appeal, for starters. Since the mecha design comes from the show, as does the opening cinematic and character art, fans of the television series will eat it up. Nothing wrong with that. Even for non-fans, IGPX stuffs a ton of cool sci-fi concepts and designs. But again, it's all from the show and when removed, have little to do with how the game actually plays.  And how it plays is precisely what ends up derailing the whole affair. As cool as the concept really is, the execution simply doesn't cut it. Here's how it all starts: you begin the game as a member of Team Satomi. Your only goal: to lead the team to victory by winning the Grand-Prix. The first three races help you get a handle on the basics. They teach you everything from defense and offensive strategies, as well as how to use your boost capabilities - more than anything else, by the way, it's learning how to use boost effectively that brings in the racing bucks in IGPX.   After you pass the three initial races, in which you cannot incur damage, you move on to the real stuff. Only it feels like you never lose your training wheels. Even though IGPX is a racing game, you have limited control over the flow of races. You drive on auto-pilot, in other words, as you lack direct control over acceleration. You can move to the left and right, even brake to a degree, but otherwise the game handles your pace. During this time, all you need to worry about is combat. You can use a number of attacks and combos, including blocks and evasive moves, to try to bring down the competition.   Problem is, none of it comes off as very brutal. More importantly, it fails to engage you all that much. It has its high-points; it's not all bad, but it never really approaches the excitement of the show. Only toward the end of every race, when IGPX turns off the auto-pilot do things get somewhat tense. Here, you actually need to drive as it were and win the race through strategic boosting and pacing. But that's about it. Even with the option to customize your mech and purchase new parts, it's honestly not that exciting. One of the cooler aspects -- dictating team formations -- helps keep things interesting for a while, but ultimately it feels underdeveloped. For the most part, you just let the AI control the throttle while you mash on buttons to inflict damage on nearby enemies. Yes, that sounds like somewhat of a short and bland description, but it rarely gets any more complex.  The IGPX license has what it takes to form the basis of a great racing title. Sadly, this first outing fails to deliver the excitement and appeal of the popular television series. The racing portion of the game takes a backseat to combat, which is problem in and of itself, but both aspects lack refinement. Younger fans of the show may find something to like here, but seasoned racing aficionados will want to look elsewhere for high-speed thrills.", "date": "Oct 4, 2006"}
