And as much as I love them, there is one thing I love more than playing a great Squaresoft, Enix, or Capcom masterpiece.  Thinking up my own RPG. What could possibly be better than sitting on my rear for days while the story of Cloud, Barret, and all the rest unfolds before my eyes?  Well, have you ever made your own RPG before?  I'm sure some of you have tried.  I'm sure others of you have wanted to.  I'm positive that most of you gamers out there fall into the second category.  You've wanted, but have never been able.  Well, here's your golden, shiny wire of hope.  RPG Maker has hit the Western part of the world at last, and all of you out there with creative minds should quiver in joy.  At long last, we have the ability to bring our epics to life, granted that we devote our time to the work. No programming knowledge is necessary.  No past experience with making games is a prerequisite. All you have to do is have a PlayStation, a memory card, and this game.   Once you've got all three, you're rip-roarin' and ready to go. You should think of a title, a main plot, some main characters, and all that jazz that goes into making a RPG that's worth playing.  On second thought, to hell with it.  Just make it pointless, stupid, and funny (works for me).  The menu system is very simplistic, which is a plus for gamers, because you can alter anything you need within a few seconds.  The entire edit mode of RPG Maker is broken up into many categories, which are the essentials for any role-playing game.   The basics are all there.  You can design characters and give them special attributes, make magic spells, create items, swords, shields, etc., and you can make towns, dungeons, deserts, and everything else.  Yes, it's a lot of work to make a RPG, but it's a lot of fun, too.  Lucky for us, all we have to do is press a few buttons to get what we want.  Programmers spend hours upon hours toying with code to get their work done.   I'm sure some of you are thinking, ~How can this do exactly what I want?  Won't it be so limited to the point that I won't want to bother with it?~  Wait to see the options for yourself before you pass judgment, bucko.  Once you get started, you won't want to stop.  Piecing together the towns and dungeons can take time, but it's satisfying to explore your creations when you've made them exactly how you want.  The battle system is just as simple to navigate as everything else.  First, you have to make your enemies.  To do this, choose from 99 different types (not including color variations), and then set the creatures' statistics.   You have control over their HP, MP, and special attacks, just like you do with your own characters.  The cool feature with enemies is that you can also make attack patterns for them; this works well with boss monsters.  For instance, you can have it be that there's a 20% chance the enemy will poison you when it strikes, a 35% chance that it will attack normally, a 25% chance that it will defend, and a 20% chance that it will cast ~fire.~  When you've created the enemies you want, you can assign them to any dungeons (or even towns) that you've made.  Once you're engaged in combat, things function just like they do in basic RPGs from the past.  The best examples I can use to compare RPG Maker to are Lufia and the Fortress of Doom and Earthbound.  You can choose from any of the commands you've made when you fight.  You can cast magic spells, unleash special attacks, attack normally, use items, use your equipment as an item, and flee from battle. There are too many details to get into when describing this game.  If you've ever played an RPG like Final Fantasy IV, try to remember all of the gameplay elements it had.  You can do just about anything that was there in your own adventures here.   Perhaps the best part of RPG Maker is that you can create your own story line.  Make it as serious or as stupid as you want.  I, myself, prefer to go the way of the moron, which my plotline clearly reflects.  Imagine a place called Undies Town, where lecherous faeries frequent the streets and where babies work in a sweatshop.  Times are not at all well, because the King Baby has sold off all the other babies to be... removed.  Little do the townsfolk know that Mamma Hookie, the head of the faeries, is behind it all.  In order to restore peace to Undies Town, you've got to put an end to Mamma and halt the slaughter.   That's just my game, of course.  Yours?  Make it whatever you want.  Fight Club RPG?  Sure, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton could go well in a role-playing game.  Final Fantasy X?  Yeah, why not beat Squaresoft to the punch?  Whatever you decide to do,  make sure that you've got plenty of time, and you will be bound to have fun.   Because the designers of RPG Maker love ya, they included hordes of things that you can use to customize your game.  You have dozens of graphic parts to choose from when putting together your towns and dungeons.  Unfortunately, all of the graphics resemble a fantasy setting, so those of you who are looking to make a sci-fi game, like The Matrix RPG, will be a bit disappointed.  Nonetheless, you have a lot of things to pick from.  Houses, cobblestones, torches, pillars, and everything else you could think of are there for your perusal.  All you've got to do is designate a position for everything to go, and it's ready for playing.   Speaking of graphics, they're downright crap if you're used to what's out there today.  The game looks as oldschool as it plays.  Those of you who can stand Super Nintendo visuals will feel comfortable.  If you can look past the fact that there are no pre-rendered backgrounds and rendered polygons, there's a world of entertainment to explore.  Similarly, the sound effects and music are limited by today's gaming standards.  Basic noises and tunes are what you have to work with.  You cannot create your own, so get used to what you've got.   It's suprisingly easy to set treasure chests, non-player characters, and other obstacles wherever you want them.  Doing this is called creating  'events'.  When you create an event, you can give it several attributes.  You can make it a person, a shop, a treasure chest, a door, a save point, a poison pit, or whatever else your heart desires.  Events can be activated in several ways.  You can choose to have an event happen when you click on a particular thing, or when you step on it.  This can trigger other things as well, such as adding an item or gold to your inventory, or adding details to the story.   RPG Maker is actually a two-part game.  In addition to the RPG edit system, there's an ~anime maker~, which players are likely to ignore.  Don't even bother trying it out.  It's difficult to use, and what you can do with it is boring.  Basically, it's there to make pictures.  You can draw with your controller, paint your pictures, and save them to your memory card.  You can also animate pre-constructed sprites and make your own little plays.  I'll pass.   In case you're unsure what ideas you would like to use in your RPG, try out the basic sample game that's already included in the edit mode.  It's very short and simple, but it should give you a good idea about what kinds of things you can do with RPG Maker, and what kinds of barriers there are.  All in all, you can make one hell of a fun epic with this game.I love this thing!  It's a dream come true for me and anyone else who has ever wanted to create his or her own RPG.  I never thought it would be possible to have something like RPG Maker. Even when I'd heard about games like this being made in Japan, I was a little skeptic. I admit that it has its flaws, though.  I'd have liked more town and dungeon graphics to choose from, and it would have been nice if the events system were a little less confusing (~switches~ especially).  Even so, no tiny hinderances like that can tear me away from my love for RPG Maker.  I plan to purchase the full box copy as soon as I've got the cash in my pocket.", "date": "Sep 22, 2000"}
