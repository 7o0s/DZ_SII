Not to be outdone, Taito also put its designers on a Wii version for Majesco to publish. The result, a truly awful collection of Taito-celebrating mini-games that ineffectively utilizes the Wii Remote's motion sensors in a variety of really bad ways.   There's nothing wrong with a videogame company patting itself on the back, showing just how much of an impact it's had on the market over the past few decades. Nintendo's been doing it in Smash Bros. and in Wario Ware, SEGA's recently rooted for itself and its IPs in the latest SEGA Superstars Tennis, and clearly Taito has a lot to party about since it's been dishing out original videogames since Space Invaders in the late 70s.   But there's certainly something wrong when the company goes ~Look how great we are!~ in a game that's anything but. Furu Furu Park, just like Turn it Around, is a collection of tiny Wario Ware-esque challenges that make references to everything Taito, from quirky Sonic Blastman to the mainstream Arkanoid. In these games, the designers utilize the Wii Remote in a variety of different ways, with  just like Wario Ware  introduction sequences showing players how they're supposed to hold the remote before the challenge begins.   Sushi, anyone?    There are many problems with the games within Furu Furu Park. They're intentionally short and shallow. We get it, they want to be Wario Ware. No problem. But many of the games control terribly, especially ones that require specific motions with the Wii Remote. In Skateboarding, for example, you're supposed to quickly hold the Wii Remote in the position displayed in the on-screen icon as quickly as possible. But when the game fails to recognize it, you're left flailing your hand trying to get the game to see that you are, indeed holding it in that position. Or in a mini-game where you hold the Wii Remote upright like a flight yoke and tip it left or right to rotate rings on a puzzle, a sushi conveyer, or the entire maze in a tiny rendition of Cameltry, the game sputters even though you're clearly holding it in the proper direction.   And the ones that simply use the Wii Remote as an NES pad are absolutely terrible designs. Taito's properties like Pocky & Rocky and Bubble Bobble are reproduced on the Wii in basic mini-game form, but they either A) play poorly, or B) play nothing like the game they're based on, or C) Both. Bet on C most of the time. The ones that are tolerable   say, Cameltry  are overly short teasers to what could have been if the designers worked on that game to extend its appeal. One basic level of Cameltry isn't enough.   There aren't that many challenges in Furu Furu Park, and none of them have any appeal to entice players to pick up and play them more than once. If they were fun I could understand shooting for the high score  at the very least the designers had the forethought of including rakings for each of the 30 games in the pack. And the multiplayer modes don't do much more than show the shortcomings of each of the mini-game's designs.The original Nintendo DS game was a terrible collection of mini-games, and the Wii version continues that tradition. Even if you make the excuse that this games a budget title, you really can't justify the crumminess of the 30 different games in this pack.", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
