No group understands this more than the unloved and lonely Dreamcast RPG fans.  Yes, there have been a few Dreamcast RPGs and unfortunately, none have been too fondly remembered; when the Dreamcast has more quality fishing games than quality RPGs, there are some serious issues that need to be resolved.  So, RPG fans waited for resolution, but unless you like running around in a armor shaped like Humpty Dumpty (I'm referring to E.G.G.), the crop of RPGs for the Dreamcast have yet to ease the hunger pangs of thin and weary DC owners.  Though this is the season for the RPG onslaught (Skies or Arcadia, Grandia II, and Phantasy Star Online), why did it take so long for Dreamcast RPG faithfuls to finally receive decent RPG titles?  Perhaps it's because the quality of role-playing games have been raised by heavyweights Square, Enix, and other third parties; the days of simple exploration, limited turn-based battles, and simplistic visuals have been replaced with huge worlds, complex magic-negating strategies, and magnanimous amounts of eye-candy.  And to make such gargantuan titles, you need a great team and good chunk of time.  A couple a years later, the development team Overworks, that includes a member of the Phantasy Star team, finally releases an RPG that will be just the beginning of a new RPG series for the Dreamcast.  It is my hope that the launch of Skies of Arcadia will is just the start of numerous, fantastic journeys. Oh, The Places You Go and the Things You'll See As with any RPG, story plays a major role in SoA.  Centuries ago, the six moons surrounding the planet have ravaged the world of Arcadia by raining mystical Moon Stones upon the land.  Due to their levitating powers, these Moon Stones created new landforms in the air, creating the sky of seas that make up the new world of Arcadia.  Man has learned to harvest the powers of the Moon Stones, but none have found the potential like those of the Old Elders.  It is these Elders that created the six powerful Gigas, monsters of enormous size and invulnerability, and used the powers of the most powerful Moon Stones to control them.  You take the role of Vyse, a young, dashing Sky Pirate of the benevolent Blue Rogue clan and soon become entangled in a race to find the Moon Stones that control these powerful Gigas.  Your best friend and companion, the feisty Aika, accompanies you on your adventures as you'll meet all sorts of characters, as you try to stop a number of groups from gaining the full power of these doomsday monsters.  From this story, you gain some scope of how big the world of Arcadia is.  Well, at least you think you do.  The enormous size of the worlds is a very humbling experience; when I explored the first dungeon, I was flabbergasted at how puny Vyse was in comparison to the mammoth dungeon maze.  Dungeons obviously get bigger and more intricate, but it is certainly an eye-opening experience not only venturing in the hallways of each dungeon, but getting to each dungeon.  As stated in the story, the world of Arcadia is made of thousands of floating islands, some no bigger than an airship, while others that would require weeks to cross WITH an airship.  Traveling from sky continent to sky continent... it's like the first time you walked into a ~Toys R' Us~ as a kid.  There's so much to explore, so many new discoveries (and finding them gives you treasure or money), so many different world, each with their own culture, out in the wild blue yonder, to think about it would be a numbing experience  both for the brain and the eye.  Aside from some pixelization when the camera zooms extremely close, this is one of the loveliest games I have ever seen for the Dreamcast.  The quality of the textures, from rocky surfaces of canyons, wood planks in airships, to the wisp-like vapor trails off your ship, this is a gorgeous game, rivaling the quality of Shenmue but with a completely different style.  While Shenmue attains a sick amount of realism, Skies of Arcadia aims for a delightful mix of exciting colors, small details, and rock solid 3D visuals.  Each of the towns your explore are all in full 3D and you'll be able to explore every nook and cranny, with no loss in visual detail.  Most of the time, you can also rotate the camera around with, again, no loss in visual detail or frame rate drop.  This type of attention to the details is exactly what is missing from the greater majority of Dreamcast games.  And just when you're enjoying the wonderful visuals, it gets better and much, much brighter.  I'm talking about the explosive special effects that assault you during battle sequences.  Smoke trails, flickering lights, bright flaming effects, crystal-like ice attacks... god almighty, the game doesn't just display effects, it hurls these images like bolts of lightning, to the viewers.  For once, the epilepsy warning at the start of the game truly applies to a game.  Combined with the solid overall visuals, lively and appealing characters, excellent use of camera angles, and some of the coolest mechanical designs for the airships, and this is one pretty game that refuses anything but your complete and total attention. Battle: By Land and Air The battle system in SoA is, in comparison to the visuals, relatively simple.  Your typical turn-based combat where you have no control over the placement of your character, adds two new features.  First is the Spirit Bar that is displayed at the top of the screen.  The Spirit Bar is the measure of your party's  that's right  spirit.  You'll charge the spirit by either Focusing (thus negating any other action in the turn) or by simply not using any moves that require spirit.  That's hard, because both magic spells and special attacks, make use of the Spirit Bar.  So, it's vital that you constantly keep the Spirit Bar somewhat charged in battle.  Secondly, each character can change the element of their main weapon during battle.  This is essentially for two reasons: it allows you to dish out more damage on certain enemies that are weak against a certain element, and it allows you to learn spells.  Using a certain element for an amount of time will building up magic experience points that help you learn the spells of that specific element.  And another rare feature is the option to change equipment in the middle of battle, and while I don't use this option too often, it is nice detail, among hundreds of details that increase your pleasure.  The airship battle sequences are also pretty simplistic.  Essentially, it's a mix of roshambo and prediction, as you'll be able to get a hint of what your opponent will be doing, but like the party battles, you make all your decision at the beginning of the turn.  The sequences that play out in airship battles cannot be controlled, and I kind like this refreshing break of cinematic suspense.  Maybe if there's a sequel, there will be more control, but as simple as the airship battles are, there is enough strategic planning to make it pretty fun. Infrequent Flaws Skies of Arcadia is not without flaw.  One of my biggest gripes is the high frequency of random encounter fights.  I understand that random battles are a standard in console RPG's... but with such a large world to explore and the wanting to actually explore the skies, random encounters occur to frequently to the pint where I really get pissed off.  The fact that you can be outnumbered means that such battles can be pretty long if you don't have attack or spells that attack a group of enemies.  Also, you don't get revive items that resurrect unconscious teammates until later in the game.  Not that I don't mind the challenge, but you'll encounter enemies early that can kill you with one spell.  With the frequency of random battles, it would've been nice to have a ~group auto attack~ button, so you don't have to press the confirmation button a number of times if you just want the whole group to perform their normal attack on the closest enemy.  The sound of the game is quite good.  Sound effects are well done, and the music to the game is wonderful.  Where it gets iffy is the voices.  During dialogue sequences, characters are limited to grunts, a quick ~hey~, or a laugh.  This adds quite a bit of character to the charming characters.  Then, you come into battle, where the voices are... pretty not good.  I think one of the most grating is Aika's ,~BACK OFF!  ALPHA STORM~, war cry that makes me muffle my ears in pain.  Not all battle cries are quite so bad, but it might get a big annoying during long sit-downs with the game.  And believe me, you're going to spend quite a bit of time exploring the seven skies.  I am very happy; Skies of Arcadia is not just one of the most beautiful Dreamcast games to play, but one of the most addicting RPG I've played in years.  Of  course, to talk about a sequel right now is pretty ridiculous, since we don't know how well the title will sell in the U.S.  And many fear that a masterpiece like Skies of Arcadia will be ignore by thousands of Dreamcast owners because they don't play RPG's.  And to those non-RPG playing Dreamcast owners, I have one thing to say... start playing.  Because I sincerely believe that this is not the first voyage into the Skies of Arcadia, but the beginning of an enchanting flight that no gamer, should miss.  And who know's how long the next time we'll have to wait.  --Anthony Chau, ~Capitan of the DC Vagabonds~, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
