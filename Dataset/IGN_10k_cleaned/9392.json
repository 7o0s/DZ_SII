{"name": "The Witcher", "name_review": "The Witcher AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/01/the-witcher-au-review", "text": "~Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I might sup on suckling pig this noon.~ You won't be hearing dialogue like this in The Witcher, thank god. After the atrocious ye olde dialogue in Two Worlds, gamers could be forgiven for worrying that other fantasy games would follow a similar approach, but not so here. In The Witcher, you're more likely to hear someone say ~your mama sucks dwarf cock~ (and yes, that is a direct quote from the game), then knee you in the balls.Welcome to a medieval game done right. Well, mostly right. Based on a famous series of novels that I haven't read (not being able to read Russian, Czech, Slovak, German, Lithuanian, French or Spanish), The Witcher drops you into a turbulent medieval world, rife with disease and conflicts between different races. It's a world where things aren't black and white, where Elven freedom fighters use intimidation and violence to combat discrimination against 'nonhumans'. Hadouken. Simple, effective, caption-worthy. Mind you, while the dialogue may not take the absurdly floral tack that Two Worlds' did, Polish development house CDProjekt is guilty of a serious  clich right off the bat. Amnesia. Your character, Geralt, is a witcher, essentially a mutated, highly trained super-human warrior. He's a whole barrel of kick-ass in other words, but the start of the game sees him being wheeled, unconscious, into the gates of the castle at Kaer Morhen. It soon transpires that no one has seen Geralt since the Great War five years ago. Well, why would they have? He died on the battlefield after all. Only he *cue spooky music* evidently didn't. Now he's back and he has no recollection of his past. It's all pretty convenient, allowing those that know him to hit him with exposition about their past dealings, as well as meaning that - while he's still a formidable fighter - he must essentially learn to use magic and specialise his skills all over again. It's a necessary evil we guess, but Geralt is a little too nonchalant about the whole thing, and doesn't seem particularly hungry to absorb as many details of the world and his life as he can. Unlike other RPGs, you have no choice of the base character you play. You are Geralt, a human (of sorts) and there's no option to get busy with another race with a radically different set of abilities. Still, there are a number of options available to you as you level up, not to mention a host of decisions about who to trust, how to align yourself, and whether or not you want to be a knight in shining armour or a bit of a bastard. Thankfully, these decisions are quite compelling, and sit atop an interesting, gritty world.The combat system is pretty solid too, and more visceral than many RPGs when you're playing from the over-the-shoulder viewpoint (those with more traditional tastes can still play from a top-down isometric perspective), as you get a real sense of being in the fight, spinning to take out enemies behind you, unleashing magic attacks at fiends running at you and so on. Geralt can carry a steel sword, silver sword, heavy weapon and light weapon, and has three attacking styles - Strong, Fast and Group, with each appropriate in different situations and against different enemies, so you'll be mixing and matching quite a bit. What is it about breasts that so many developers can't do? Seriously, the breasts in this game are scarier than some of the enemies. Melee combat is assigned to the left mouse button, but rather than just hammering away at it, the game uses a timing system that allows you to parlay attacks into combos. Once you've initiated an attack with a single click you'll see the cursor 'flame up' at a certain point - click again and Geralt will roll straight into a new attack. Get the timing wrong and he'll falter, giving your enemy a chance to get a hit in. It's a good system because it really means you can turn the tide of battle in your direction. There are drawbacks, however. Chiefly, there's a break between clicking attack and Geralt actually starting to attack, so in the heat of battle you can be left wondering whether the click has registered. Click again, however, and you'll negate the original click. Follow me? It's really just a matter of knowing how the system works and being patient.Magic attacks (or 'Signs') are assigned to the right mouse button, and start out with a basic attack to knock down foes. As the game progresses you'll earn the ability to unleash ranged attacks, drain opponents' vitality and cause fear. The icing on the cake is the pain-causing Yrden sign - fully level that sucker up and you'll get the 'Circle of Death' ability. How can something called the Circle of Death possibly not be cool?    Switching weapons and fighting styles is nice and straightforward, thanks to hotkeys and a good pause menu, and Geralt can also dodge and dive back to evade attacks. Once a battle's over, holding ALT highlights any objects, people or (most importantly) loot that you can interact with, making this game less fiddly than some. Other information is nice and easy to find as well - active quests can be tagged to give you a waypoint system on the mini-map, while you can also set your own waypoint for any major location you've been to. Information about the world, characters and beasts is also concise and interesting on the journal page, and you can quickly check what status effects you've applied on the game's minimal HUD, as well as how long they're going to last for. There are, however, a few seriously clunky elements. The item system is a disaster - thrown helter skelter onto a tiny grid, there's no easy way to sort them, so potion ingredients, food, weapon upgrade tools and so on are all mixed in together. To find something you want you can take minutes as you highlight each item in turn to work out what it is. Girly hair versus girly swipe. The potion-making system is just as bad (and indeed, is an extension of the item system's issues). You'd think that it would be as simple as 'get recipes for potions, collect the appropriate ingredients, make potions', but alas, it's not to be. There's a lot of fluffing about trying to work out what goes into each potion and what you're missing. It's amazing that there's no simple way to ascertain which potions you do and don't have the ingredients for. Then, to actually get your fire-burn-and-cauldron-bubble-on you'll need to find a campfire to meditate by, which may or may not be a trek from the nearest inn, where you've stashed all your surplus items. This system could have - and indeed, should have - been much, much better, and it's a real shame given that there's a good variety of potions, many with interesting effects, and it's a core element of the game mechanics.The world of The Witcher is nice and sprawling, from isolated villages to bustling towns and massive strongholds, with rolling hills in-between. There's a good sense of scale here without being overly large. The world is well-realised visually too, with an effective day/night cycle, really moody weather effects (you can feel your spirit of adventure start to ebb as the rain starts hammering down on a cold, lonely night) and some beautiful environments. On the downside, you'll see character models repeated a fair bit (same with voices), while some of the NPC animations can be a bit goofy, as can some of Geralt's more floral fighting spins and pirouettes. While the visuals are certainly impressive on the whole, there's a price to pay. You're going to spend a fair amount of time looking at loading (and saving!) screens - a throwback from using the Aurora engine as a base. It's annoying to pop into a house to rifle through someone's stuff, only to have to sit and wait to get back out into the street. Plenty of developers have licked the ability to stream in content as needed, and The Witcher would have greatly benefited from this tech. Oh, and the game makes a mockery of the term 'quick-save'.We should also mention that while the world itself is populated by interesting characters, conflicts and decisions, The Witcher is lacking a final level of storytelling polish. You'll occasionally find that there's a bit of a leap of faith from scene to scene, when a short cutscene would have sufficed to link the two. Some of the dialogue seems a little disjointed too, like two completely separate conversations have been spliced together. And as is the way with sprawling RPGs, not every quest on offer is interesting, and you'll occasionally feel like a hamster in a wheel, being forced to complete quests that are there for the sake of padding in order to advance the plot.We may not have read the source material, but CD Projekt has certainly created a compelling RPG in The Witcher. This is a world thats interesting and flawed, and as Geralt makes his way in it, hell have to make some hard decisions, which can  and do  affect the plot from that point onwards. Throw in some gorgeous visuals, a first rate score and solid combat mechanics and you have a game thats well worth a look.", "date": "Nov 1, 2007"}
