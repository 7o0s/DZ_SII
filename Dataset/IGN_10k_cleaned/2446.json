There simply aren't very many of them, and what few exist are mostly made by small-time outfits who primarily sell over the web.It's not that sports games don't sell, quite the opposite in fact. We have slews of arcade sports games. There must be at least twenty to thirty new football, hockey, baseball, basketball, games every year, across all the platforms, to say nothing of all the snowboarding, skateboarding, and barrel-riding games that choke the shelves. But these are for casual gamers, button-mashers who never think beyond the home run swing, never yearn to take on the real challenge in sports -- building a championship franchise across the years, crafting a dynasty to last the ages.And that's a shame. I can't imagine this void exists because there's no interest. There's a huge segment of American sports fans that go nuts for stats, for simulations, for management games of all kinds. Look at the popularity of fantasy football, of rotisserie league baseball. There are entire magazines, leagues, and organizations devoted to this hobby. But this audience -- typically older and more affluent than your average videogamer -- isn't interested in the kind of sports games you buy at the mall, precisely because of the arcade slant of those games. Or to be blunt, Home Run Derby is for thirteen-year-olds.Of course, it doesn't have to be like this. In England, one of the most successful and long-running franchises is something called Championship Manager, an awesome and expansive soccer management game in which you handle everything from recruitment of players, training camps, contract negotiations, formations, substitutions, and all the other duties of a general manager and head coach. It's truly a fantastic game, and even someone like me who knew next to nothing about English football when I first began was able to eventually figure out some of the formations and guide my club, however ineptly, through a series of embarrassing defeats and even the occasional win.But I'm an American, and I longed for a Championship Manager-type game for one of the big American sports. Fortunately there are a handful games out there that help fill that void. Baseball Mogul, in my opinion, is the best.In this game, you are the general manager of your franchise, in control of every aspect of your baseball team except the actual games themselves. You set the lineup, you arrange your pitching rotation, you stock your bullpen and bench with quality substitutes, and when injuries happen, it's you who gets to comb the free agent wires or your minor league prospects to find a suitable fill-in.The 2002 version is the third iteration of the game, and it's the best edition yet. It's the most polished, easy-to-use, and most feature-rich out of the bunch. Still, I couldn't help but a feel a little disappointment. The new features, while great, could've been so much more, and the look and the feel of the game remains painfully drab.But first, let's get into the game itself.We're in the MoneyAllocating your resources is your primary tool in building a championship franchise. In fact, really the only other tools you have to help you win is setting your lineup, pitching rotation, and coaching tendencies (hit and run vs. steal, etc.), and how well you can trade with your opponents.But it all begins with the budget. The amount of money you take in depends on how big a city your team is in, how loyal and affluent your fans are (though, build a consistent winner and watch attendance go way up), and how much you can charge for tickets and local broadcasts. Keep in mind that in baseball, there's no salary cap, and if parity is the byword of the NFL, then disparity is the rule in Major League Baseball. The financial structure of baseball is such that the big money, big market teams -- especially New York -- have tremendous, built-in advantages. In other words, anyone who thinks the New York Yankees are winning championship after championship because of teamwork, heart, tradition, or any other sports  clich is pretty darn nave.Baseball tries to hide this from its fans, and in fact one of the conditions for Baseball Mogul to use the Major League Baseball Players' Association license was that it couldn't use real dollars in player contracts, team revenues, and the other financial aspects of the game. This is unfortunate, because the previous incarnations of the game used real dollar figures, and it's easier to think to yourself, ~Okay, this guy is a $5 million relief pitcher and this guy is a $200,000 outfielder~ than trying to figure out those same rations in terms of the games' ~points~ system.Fortunately translating points into real dollars is fairly simple; it's about 200,000 dollars per point on a player's contract.Spending money is where the game gets interesting. Free agents are always tempting, but at the beginning of a season, they will all, almost to a man, want far more cash than comparable players on your team are earning. On the other hand, if you can wait them out, even to the All-Star Break, you can often sign a great player at a decent price for a good, long-term contract. On the other hand, you must be careful! Often a computer GM would snap a player I was eyeing for just a little too long.Besides spending money on your payroll (by far the biggest chunk of your budget), you'll also allocate resources to your medical staff, to your farm system, and to scouting. The more you spend on medicine, the less often your players will get hurt, and for less a period of time, but since injuries tend to be random anyway, I don't think it's worthwhile to go nuts hiring doctors -- there's only so much you can do to stave off fate. Spending resources on minor leaguers tends to be a good idea, it seems to help their development process, but the area I really like to spend the most on is scouting. Since I trade for players, particularly minor leaguers, quite frequently, I find that an accurate scouting report is the single most indispensable tool in my arsenal for building a championship contender.What's also nice about Mogul's economics is the fact that you can even run a deficit, just like in real life. Personally, I can never bear to do this, I'd rather have a losing season than red ink, but I see computer players running up some truly monstrous debts at times. That extra level of verisimilitude is nice.The Trading BlockAnother great feature of Baseball Mogul has always been its trading screen, which allowed you to offer all kinds of combinations of players and cash for other players or cash. Now the trading logic in arcade sports games is usually garbage, but not here, you'll like this interface and you'll like the snappy comebacks the computer-controlled GMs will have for your outrageous offers. Still, there was room for improvement, and in this new version, the AI managers value young pitching prospects much more than they used to.Trading has also been bolstered with something called the Trading Block. Previously, in order to find a player who fit your qualifications, you'd use the search and filter functions to find candidates, and then begin the lengthy process of negotiating with six or seven teams to find the best deal. But sometimes all you want to do is unload some high-priced, injury-prone veteran whose skill ratings have seriously declined but who's still under a big fat contract with your club. You can always release such players, but with this new trading block you can now simply throw their names out there, indicate what you're looking for in return, and offers from the rest of the league will start rolling in (or not, if your player is too highly paid).More BonusesThose two things -- the changes to the monetary system and the implementation of the trading block -- are, I think, the major changes in this version of Mogul worth noting. But there are many other features worth at least a mention, so in no particular order, here are some more of the cool new features or major improvements this version of Mogul has that past editions didn't.Licensed Players and Pictures: This is a big improvement, nothing is duller than having to change a team full of ~Borry Bandses~ back to their real names. Photos of the real players are nice too.Strategy Settings: There are now old Tony LaRussa Baseball-type sliders you can manipulate to influence how often your coach (in the game simulator) will hit and run, steal second, etc. This is cool, because you can tailor your team towards slugging, stealing, etc., and then set your sliders accordingly.All-Stars and Accolades: The game now simulates an All-Star Game as well, and the player cards now reflect how many Golden Gloves and All-Star Appearances a player has had. The newspaper doesn't do a good job of announcing All-Star starting lineups, but you can look at the box scores and see how your players did.Better Calendar: Although they took away the ~Play Until such and such date~ feature off the calendar, they did improve it immensely by making it easy to click on each calendar day and call up that box score. Perfect for scanning weeks of action when you're trying to figure out which pitcher keeps giving up the big game.Contract Negotiations: These have been greatly improved by the addition of contract length as well as mid-season re-negotiations. I find players are more amenable to re-signing with your team mid-season then after they've officially become free agents. It's also aesthetically pleasing to keep the same core team year after year.Some DrawbacksOf course, as I alluded to earlier in this review, there were some disappointments too. The single most disappointing thing for me was the conversion of real dollars into ~points,~ but the following drawbacks also irked me as well:Missing Player Portraits: The new MLB player pics are nice, but unfortunately, it seems to mean that computer-created (fictional) minor leaguers no longer have their own random pictures, but instead all appear as blank silhouettes. This becomes really dull after a campaign of twenty seasons or so, when all the ~licensed~ players with real photos have retired, and your entire team is a bunch of blanks.  I don't know why they got rid of their goofy little homemade pictures...anything is better than nothing.No Live Game: You never actually control a batter or hitter in Baseball Mogul, you simply simulate games, a day, a week, or a month at a time. Still, it used to be that you could choose a few select games and actually watch a little picture window that would, batter by batter, show you what happened during the game. I didn't use this feature very often, but I enjoyed it when I did -- after say a couple hours of intense roster management to get my team into the post-season, there was nothing like sitting back and watching them step up to the plate in those critical playoff and Series games. Sadly, this feature seems to have vanished without a trace.No Newspaper Filter: Baseball Mogul has one of the coolest features you'll ever see in a sports game, something called the automated sportswriter, which generates little news stories about major games, important injuries, contract deals, playoff wins, and the like.These can be interesting, but sometimes (especially when you're simming entire months at a time, not stopping except for injuries), you'll get too many newspaper stories piled up in the queue, and there's no way to filter them or scroll through them quickly. Toggles that would let you select only stories about the National League West, no-hitters, career-ending injuries, or some other combination would've been nice.DRAB and BORING graphics: By this, I mean the look and layout of the menus themselves. Sure, Baseball Mogul is basically a spreadsheet and I don't expect (or want) fancy pants 3D-rendered time-wasting intro screens, but even a little color on the screens would've been nice. Look at Championship Manager for an attractive, stylish spreadsheet game, but this is a boring, drab, gray Windows thing -- and furthermore, you can't even resize the screen!In ConclusionThat's pretty much the long and short of it. Baseball Mogul 2002 is a great game. Recruiting, trading, training, buying, building, and basically controlling every aspect of a major league baseball team -- short of stepping on the sacrosanct green diamond cathedral itself -- is covered, or at least touched on.It's also a unique game, and one that certainly deserves a wider audience. This is a game genre I think with a lot of potential, and I can only imagine how tasty a High Heat or revived Tony LaRussa would be if they used a Baseball Mogul-style financial and player database as the backbone of their sims.I guess the bottom line is, if you're already a fan of this series, you pretty much know what to expect, and whether or not you need this year's edition is more a function of how much free cash you have -- in other words, it'd be nice to have, but it's not some revolutionary step forward.But on the other hand, if you've never heard of sports management games like this before but you love baseball, stats, management, and the strategies, roster moves, and economics behind the game, then you will probably love this game, and in many ways I wrote this review mainly for you, to raise awareness of this kind of game with the public at large.So go on, give Baseball Mogul a spin.
