Aside from the different methods of racing -- in-line skates, skateboard, mountain bike, and street luge -- it's just like Road Rash, I mean exactly. And that wouldn't be the first game on my list to rip-off.  First off, you race down linear city and country streets, competing with other skaters and lugers. There're jumps and obstacles along the way, including some pretty cool Evel Knievel-style jumps onto moving cable cars (yes, there's even a race through San Francisco). You can even hit and kick your opponents, just like in Road Rash.  The graphics are sprite-based, and decent at best, but fail to show off the amazing capabilities of the PSX's graphic engine. This is surprising considering ESPN Extreme was one of the flagship launches for the machine, but go figure. The courses themselves are fairly uninspiring, with the occasional jump or barrel to thwart your progress, and soon begin to look the same.  ESPN Extreme Games isn't the worst game ever made, and can be pretty fun. There're just so many games for the PlayStation that look better, play better, and are more fun.
