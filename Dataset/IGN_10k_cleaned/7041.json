And while it offers a ready source of exciting scenarios for game developers, it is possible to get too much of a good thing. The recent overabundance of World War 2 games has certainly managed to sap the setting of some of its appeal. The latest entry into the genre is Moscow to Berlin: Red Siege. While the game has an undeniable charm, the field is far too crowded for it to stand out from the crowd.  There's just a single campaign here, told across three chapters. Starting with the Germans securing the river crossings at Brest and ending with the Soviets storming the Reichstag, the 20 missions of the campaign cover the highlights of the fight between the Germans and Soviets. Players will alternate control of German and the Soviet force. While it gives the game a sort of detached feel, it's nice to have the missions play out in chronological order and allow the players to participate in the successes of both sides during the war.   This is in contrast to the heavy story in Monte Cristo's Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps. There are no characters here and no plot beyond the basic historical background of each mission. Some players may miss the narrative here but it can also be a nice change to pace to play a game that doesn't try to put a human face on absolutely everything.  You'll find a nice range of missions in Moscow to Berlin. Fights range from docks and railyards to massive cities and large open fields. The maps are relatively small here and there are usually no more than a few dozen units for you to control. The smaller scale really puts the emphasis on tactics and maneuver. Most missions require you to defeat enemy units and capture specific locations. Occasionally you'll be given a defensive mission as well. There are no explicit bonuses for doing well or achieving a mission's secret objective but the game hints that the game states that your degree of success in a mission will have an effect on later missions.   Unfortunately, Moscow to Berlin suffers from at least one game killing bug. Halfway through the campaign we were required to capture an objective that apparently doesn't exist. We're not sure if this is a chronic problem or not; it's not mentioned on any of the game's forums but these are too thinly populated for that to be any conclusive proof that no one else is having the problem.  While we're on the subject of the lack of interest in the game, we've yet to find any opponents online. There are a few multiplayer options you might want to try out here but you'll have a hell of a time finding someone to play with. There's no skirmish mode for offline play but you can replay any of the scenarios you've completed in the campaign.  Moscow to Berlin includes pretty much every unit you'd expect to find in a game about the Eastern Front. Katyushas, Hummels, T-34s, Stugs, IS2s and a host of other units find their way into your rosters. Though not entirely 100% accurate in terms of abilities and limitations, each unit in the game approximates its performance on the battlefield. Stugs make short work of anything in their range but have a hard time turning to meet new threats while BT7s can get in and out of combat very swiftly. You can browse through an in-game encyclopedia to see and learn about each and every of the hundred-plus units included in the game.      Though this is clearly a tank-oriented game, there's a variety of infantry to use as well. The infantry can be put to good use on the ground but you'll also want to consider putting your foot troops in some of your vehicles as certain types of soldiers grant bonuses to the vehicles they crew. Put a scout in your T60 and you'll increase its sight radius; put an officer in your SD KFZ and it will move slightly faster. The one infantry unit you'll find yourself using most often is the sapper. His ability to spot and clear mines is absolutely essential to the types of battles you'll be fighting.  Unlike most recent games, there's no purchasing of units in between missions. The unit rosters in each and every mission are pre-set so you won't have a chance to personalize your fighting force. Additionally, the switch between German and Soviet forces leaves you little room to get attached to any particular units. That doesn't mean that you won't be getting additional forces on the battlefield during the course of the mission.   Unfortunately, the AI leaves a lot to be desired, both on the friendly and enemy sides. In terms of your own forces, you'll have constant pathfinding problems. Obstacles in the terrain and the proximity of your own units are likely to stymie your attempts to get your units from one place to another. You'll frequently find that half of your units refuse to move if there's even the slightest obstruction nearby. It can make getting your units together for an attack a real pain in the ass. You'll also notice that lots of your units tend to advance in reverse rather than turning to meet new threats head on.  If the enemy units aren't plagued by those exact problems, they still suffer from some notable deficiencies. Most prominent is their tendency to completely ignore anything that's not an immediate threat. Sure, you'll occasionally be surprised by an enemy who's gone on the offensive but, for the most part, the enemy is content to sit there waiting for your attack.   The graphics are probably the best aspect of the game. The degree to which your actions can impact the game world really brings the battles to life. Buildings crumble as your artillery fires into them and power lines and trees collapse as your tanks drive over them. Loads of great explosions and a variety of smoke and fire effects add to the believability of the game. Unfortunately, the graphics seem less impressive when you get close up -- the textures are very rough and the models a bit blocky.  On the sonic front, Moscow to Berlin delivers a soundtrack worthy of Saturday afternoon war movies and it suits the game well. The dialogue is a bit off, particularly the accents and responses.Despite having a few notable strengths, Moscow to Berlin suffers in comparison to the other WW2 RTS games that have crossed our desks in the last year or so. Stacked against those other titles, Moscow to Berlin tends to fade into the background. When you confront the AI problems and the sometimes-buggy mission design, the few things that Moscow to Berlin aren't enough to keep your interest.", "date": "Jun 30, 2006"}
