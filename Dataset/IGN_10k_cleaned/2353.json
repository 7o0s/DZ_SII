It's also the ~new~ game from TimeGate serving as a prequel to the acclaimed and very interesting RTS Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns. Why does it have that taint you can taste? Because you turn the tables on the first game and take control of the evil side of things as you show the world of Khaldun just exactly how ruthless as bastage you can really be. This game, called Kohan: Ahriman's Gift, is being sold as a stand-alone prequel to the original, but after playing the game, it made me wonder a little why it wasn't just a good expansion. For while the game is still good, and there have been some new units and maps added, the gameplay is almost exactly the same as the original. Nevertheless, if you couldn't get enough of the Immortal Sovereigns or haven't played it at all yet, it's still worth picking up as a great strategy game.  The story in the game, as the whole prequel thing would hint at, takes place before Immortal Sovereign and follows the story of the fall of Khaldun to the Ceyah who are affectionately known as the ~jerks who like to kill stuff and ruin life for the rest of us.~ You'll play the part of one of the bigger jerks named Roxanna Jovidan who has her eye on the big prize of co-rulership of the world with our good friend Ahriman the biggest bad guy of the bunch. She's been stuck away sleeping in an amulet for six ages and is a little ticked about it. So armed only with your unending sense of evil doing and a whole crapload of armies, you begin your conquest of Khaldun.  So now that I've gone over that, let's talk a little about the main point that I have to get across in this review. It's a stand-alone sequel. Yes, I said that in the opening paragraph, but it bears repeating. The gameplay in Ahriman's Gift is almost exactly the same (apart from some tweaks and new units) as Immortal Sovereign. This isn't necessarily a bad thing except for one thing; the game is supposed to be a stand-alone prequel. But it tastes like an expansion. And should have been an expansion for the price of one.   Aside from that, Ahriman's Gift is still good and fun. The production values of the game are right up there with some really crisp and clear colors and graphics all around. The menus are very nice and everything is easily navigable. The graphics in the game suffer from the same problems as the first of course. The armies and buildings look like they should be nice, but you can't really tell because they're all so small. There's plenty of reason for that I suppose as some of the battles would be pretty unmanageable without the zoom level, but it would be nice to be able to move on in and take a closer look at the action and the units that you're involved with. Being that far away from the action just gives the game kind of an impersonal feel. The fact is, you can't even play the game if you don't have a monitor that supports 1028x764 resolution.  Sounds are fairly well done with acceptable voice acting even if nobody here would win any awards. The music is also just fine even though I can honestly say that it was nothing I really noticed as being exceptionally good or bad as I actually had to go back into the game to take pay attention. One thing I do know is that some of the army acknowledgments got very old very quick. Those damn undead moaning and Roxanna either doing everything in the name of the Dark Saadya or promising to cause some pain wherever she goes.  The gameplay is still sweet in most cases though with a nicely balanced look at combat and economics that are subtle yet complex enough to hold my interest. The use of zones of supply where your armies can heal, controls that tell the reaction range of your armies, and several others are implemented very well and are an nice approach to dealing with a large scale RTS such as this. While some of the actual battle mechanics may leave a little to be desired at times in terms of tactics, the main brunt of your strategy will be about gaining an economy, expanding, setting up outposts in important locations, and most especially setting up your armies for maximum efficiency in battle.  This was and is still the best part of the Kohan experience and something that I hope more developers down the line take note of and even improve upon. Instead of following in the footsteps of virtually every other RTS in creation, TimeGate chose to venture out and try something new that proved very successful and more than a little bit of fun. Usually you just click a button at a building to create a unit. In Kohan, you actually build armies of six. First off is the front line that will be four of the same type of unit. You can use infantry, cavalry, and ranged units here. Secondly are the two support slots that are selected separately. You're allowed to put any unit you have available in these spots (aside from the heroes) including the ~support~ units that are more powerful and usually have special weapons or special effects on the other forces in their group. Finally is your captain which will either be default or chosen from your list of hero characters that are even more powerful yet and also have special abilities. Picking and choosing the right combination can be an interesting and enjoyable task, and will definitely have some effect on the outcome of battles. Each of these units costs a certain amount of upkeep however, which is where your economy comes in.  There are four types of resources in the game that are gathered through various components that you attach to each of your cities. You don't have to worry about taking care of peons harvesting wood or anything such as that so that you have more free time to worry about battles. But the catch is that there are only a certain number of slots open in each city for these components so you'll need to choose carefully what you build in each. It gives you more opportunity to make some interesting strategic decisions because what units you can call in at each of the cities depends on what faction the city originally belonged to and what components you have attached to it. And each of the forces you purchase, with the exception of some, require upkeep in the form of those resources you gather, so you'll also need to balance your use of expensive powerful units with ones that are easier on your wallet for a little bit of cannon fodder.  Aside from the main campaign in the game, there are also two smaller campaigns to keep you interested. But just as in the original, the campaign scenarios don't really vary too much. Most of the times it'll be annihilate everything that stands in your way. The maps and the circumstances will be different, but everything will come down to who has the bigger army and can produce the fastest.  But there's more for everyone this time around because there's even more multiplayer maps as well as the random map generator, and a level editor to create your own maps. The editor is pretty simple to use and those that have the patience to design a map will have a ball.  This is still a solid, solid real time strategy game. But there doesn't really seem to be enough of a change here to warrant a full price at retail. This would have been a really good expansion for Immortal Sovereigns... but it's not. Like I said before, if you really loved the first game, and I know there are a few of you out there that did, then you'll certainly like this, especially if you can find it on sale somewhere for a lower price. Those that haven't played Kohan at all yet who are fans of the genre will also appreciate the experience and won't feel left behind due to the excellent tutorial campaigns that will teach you everything you need to know to get you started.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
