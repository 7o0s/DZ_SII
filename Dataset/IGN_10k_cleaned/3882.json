Wireless handsets offered blah sports experiences, until Sorrent and their FOX Sports lineup turned things around. But even Sorrent has left baseball fans high and dry, with no diamond contest in sight. Enter Blue Heat Games with MLB Slam, a title that demands you junk that notion of style over substance.  Features: Full MLB license Choose pitches and swings  The moment you boot up MLB Slam, you will not be impressed. In fact, you may even want to drive down to Blue Heat's office and shake your four bucks out of somebody. Let's face it, the game looks kinda, well, crappy. Like sub-NES crappy. Like two frames of animation crappy.  But give it three minutes.  That's all it will take for MLB Slam to complete win you over, and make you forget about how sorry that fielder looks when he runs for a pop fly. (The original Pitfall Harry has more frames!)  What counts with any game is not the appearance, but how it plays. And MLB Slam plays like a true baseball fan's dream, complete with a smart intuitive interfaces and intelligent AI.  Everything in MLB Slam just makes sense. The batting is simple. When you see that ball coming, press whatever direction on the control pad you want to swing in. Does the ball look high?  Press up.  Pitching is similar.  A different pitch is assigned to each of the four directions, and pressing ~select~ throws a heater down the middle. Running bases? Incredibly intuitive -- press in the direction you want the little guy to run.  But it's not so simplistic that it's un-fun. There is some real strategy to MLB Slam. For example, when a batter steps up to the plate, you can see where his ~hot zones~ are -- where he's most likely to smash the ball. You may want to consider avoiding those zones, but you may also consider that the batter knows you will avoid his zones. Every player has different hot zones. For example, Barry Bonds step up to the plate with every zone lit deep red. And he hits just as many homers in the game as he does in real life.  MLB Slam greatly benefits from the MLB license, as you're able to play as your favorite teams and players. True, there's no huge season mode or campaign mode where you can trade players or try and take the pennant. But, come on, this is a handset game. And if Blue Heat wasn't able to make the thing look any better, how can you expect a season mode?  Now, about them visuals. Ugh. This really is a boring-looking game, what with the Atari 2600-ish graphics and shallow color palette. Especially coming down from Sorrent's FOX Sports line-up. But perhaps the bells and whistles needed to be swept aside to make room for the AI and rosters. Yeah, it's been announced as an N-Gage game, but you needn't wait for Nokia's pricey handset to get your mitts around a quality (albeit, low-res) baseball experience. Blue Heat Games, which has an impressive SEGA pedigree, really pulled something special out with this simplistic-looking baseballer than turns out, after a few minutes play, to not be so simplistic, after all. For sports fans, this will be money well spent.", "date": "Sep 4, 2003"}
