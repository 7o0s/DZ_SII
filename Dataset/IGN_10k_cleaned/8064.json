He's Sega's go-to guy, the creative mastermind of the company  just like Nintendo's got Miyamoto and Konami's got Kojima, Yu is the man for the House of the Hedgehog. His reputation he earned starting in the '80s, where he revolutionized the arcade scene with spectacular graphics and elaborate customized cabinets that offered truly immersive experiences. He was responsible for OutRun, one of the most notable arcade car racers of all time. He did the Virtua Fighter series, bringing 2D brawling into the third dimension. And he had Hang-On, the motorcycle racer where you sat on an actual plastic replica bike to lean, turn and drive into the screen.    ~Into the screen~ was a theme of Yu's, who focused on 3D gaming long before the days of polygons took hold. It was a focus that led him to create Space Harrier. It was one of his first efforts, a 1985 arcade shooter that offered a third-person, behind-the-back perspective and fast, frantic action in a fantasy setting. Fantasyland is actually the name of the world where Space Harrier takes place, a colorful realm filled with monsters, obstacles and checkerboard floors.   Space Harrier II is the home console sequel to Yu's arcade original. It came to the Genesis in 1989, one of that system's earliest releases. And here again it has appeared, one of the earliest games to hit the Wii's Virtual Console in emulated, downloadable form. The game has not held up. At fault? The framerate.   Space Harrier II's visuals are far too choppy, a critical distraction that really takes away a lot of the fun of the experience. You play as a flying man with a giant gun, dashing forward along the Z-axis, Star Fox style, as enemies and obstacles come rushing at you from on the horizon. You blast away at the baddies and dodge around the trees, walls and pillars, but it's in these objects that the choppiness appears. Space Harrier was a complex and visually intricate design running on arcade hardware  the Genesis just couldn't totally handle its style in '89.   The shoot-'em-up gameplay is a bit limited, too. Space Harrier's played from a unique perspective, one that hasn't often been imitated since, but it's really just another pattern-based swarm shooter, seen through a different lens. You can memorize when and from where enemies will appear, as there's little randomness in their behavior. It's a design that can seem challenging at first, but becomes much less so after just a few repeated run-throughs.   The game does offer a few different options to customize your controls, though a sideways Wiimote will work just fine. And you can choose from any of several different levels to start off on at the very beginning  with boss battles and bonus stages mixed in throughout the harrying journey. So, overall, it's not that Space Harrier II is bad  it's just kind of uninteresting and difficult to watch.   Seeing Space Harrier II running on the Wii gives some hope for the future  perhaps Yu Suzuki will be inspired by the new consoles unique controls and choose to work on a fresh project taking advantage of that potential. An update to Space Harrier, using Wiimote aiming, Nunchuk character movement and having a silky-smooth 60fps framerate would be killer. But, unfortunately, none of that is here in this simple emulation. This versions tough to love, and even tougher to recommend. Youd be better off saving your 800 Points and going for a different Genesis title  Im sure Yu wont mind at all.", "date": "Feb 16, 2007"}
