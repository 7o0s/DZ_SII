We're happy to report that King of Fighters XI is not only a very fun game to dive into, but it's also a great deal. For just about twenty bucks, you get a surprisingly complex 2D fighter with over 40 characters and several modes. Sounds good to us.   King of Fighters features a healthy assortment of options to start. You can jump right into Arcade Play, Team Play or Single Play against the computer, but you can also try any of these modes with a friend. Arcade Play gives you control over a team of three, and you can switch characters out at any time -- even in the middle of a combo. Team Play also lets you choose three characters, but only one character fights at a time in an elimination-style match. Lastly, as you might expect, Single Play is a standard one-on-one battle with a set number of rounds for each fight. Simple enough.    The other options you have include Endless, Challenge and Practice. Endless pits you against a continuous stream of opponents until you succumb to defeat, Challenge offers forty different challenges (go figure) with special rules for each, and you can fine-tune your skills in a robust and well-implemented practice arena. There's nothing overly original here, but there's enough to keep you entertained.   The real question at hand is how the game plays. Fighting games rely almost entirely on their combat mechanics, considering their lack of story and reduced emphasis on other traditional gaming elements (like level design, for one). We must admit that King of Fighters XI has a rich, responsive and enjoyable fighting system filled with special moves, counters, character switches and more. You know a fighting game is at least attempting to strive for depth when it posses a ~Normal Move Cancel Emergency Evasion.~ Wow.   As we mentioned before, this is a very old-school 2D fighter, but with a more modern sense of depth and accuracy. Every character has a good number of techniques at his or her disposal, and the variety is impressive. Of course, you must remember that when you have so many characters, their moves all start to blend together, but there's enough originality to make each fighter feel mostly unique.    The real problem is that the character sprites -- like many other 2D fighters -- have clearly not been optimized for the title. Some may be newer than others, but none of them are terribly sharp. While this is mildly disappointing, it's also expected, because a member of a long-running franchise such as this one usually refines its combat over its visuals. We've seen better 2D on the PS2, but the art is still solid enough. On a more positive note, the animation quality is generally good and the game rarely slows down during battle, which we were very pleased with.   The choices! The presentation, while not astounding, is sharp and the various menus load quickly. There are also a number of extra galleries containing character art that are certainly worthy of perusal. Furthermore, there are several cool combat features that we appreciated, like being able to select a ~Service~ after you lose a match to give yourself assistance. These services include boosting your power or cutting your opponents health in half. These crutches are entirely optional and exist purely to lessen the challenge of a particular match you may find yourself stuck on, which will more than likely occur.   Unless you're extremely skilled with these characters already, you're probably going to be annihilated by the game's bosses. Whether this is viewed as a problem or not will vary from person to person, but the difficulty spikes absurdly at each boss encounter, which can be frustrating -- especially for newcomers.   We would also like to note that after you lose a match in any of the three ~main~ modes, you can't perform a quick restart and try again -- you'll have to exit out of the fight, hit continue, select a service (or decline them), reselect your characters, reselect your leader and battle order, and then finally begin again. This process can be very tiresome, so be wary of the wait.The King of Fighters XI is fun, complex and has a ton of characters to try out, with only a handful of them requiring an unlock. At only about $20, it's hard not to recommend this to fighting game enthusiasts. While it doesn't bring anything new to the table, and its visuals fail to impress, the fast-paced tag-team battles and old-school challenge make this a title to look out for. Casual gamers beware: this is a game with an absurd amount of information to learn and master, so skip this one if you don't want to invest the time and sore thumbs.", "date": "Dec 19, 2007"}
