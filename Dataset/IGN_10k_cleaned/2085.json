That said, PC Madden fans have been getting the raw deal of late with versions that haven't quite matched their console brethren in feature set, gameplay or visuals.   Play Modes And despite being a small step in the right direction, Madden NFL 2002 for PC is once again more of a console rehash than it is something new or innovative, as it's based mostly on last year's PlayStation 2 engine instead of the much-improved 2002 console iteration.    That said, PC owners will be pleased to know that they're getting the most feature rich Madden around with plenty of extra stuff that's not in any of the console versions. In addition to the online play, which supports single game and franchise mode play, the PC also has a much more in-depth create-a-team abilities that allow for user-created logos and uniform colors that are much more highly adjustable than in the console iterations.   Beyond the PC-exclusive options, Madden NFL 2002 also features many other features that will be seen in versions across all platforms including Exhibition mode, Practice, Season, Franchise and Great Games. The Franchise mode is the blood and guts here and can be played with options such as Salary Cap, Trade Deadline, Career Stats, and Draft Time turned on or off. During the season, all of the same options that are available in a Single Season are available including the ability to trade players, sign free agents or release players, as the big difference comes at the end of a year when the off-season begins.   During the off-season of a franchise, the user is allowed to take part in all of the same end of year tasks that a real general manager would take care of. You can check up on the players that have retired and see how much each player in the league has improved, and then resign players that have had their contracts expired and take part in a pre-season draft of a created crop of college graduates.   Gameplay The game can be played from several different camera angles including Madden, Madden Classic, Madden Long, Zoom Cam, Blimp, Sideline and Television, though only the first three are the only ones that are honestly playable. Player control is fairly responsive with the one hitch being that it makes use of a momentum based physics model that leans towards sim-like control in that you won't be able to have players cut on a dime at full speed and keep that top speed.  You'll see how this affects the game most in the running game, where reading and accurately hitting the correct holes is much more important than your hand-eye coordination with moving the ball carrier around with the controller. While running the ball is much easier than it has been in the past, it becomes a bit too overly difficult when you up the game's difficulty to All-Pro or Madden. Even if you tweak the AI sliders on these two levels, most users will find that it's in their best interest to abandon the running attack altogether.   Similarly, users will find that regardless of the difficulty setting, whether Rookie or Madden, the CPU will never put up a good running game against you. Even if you're playing on the Madden difficulty setting and use nothing but loose Dime defenses over the course of an entire NFL season, you're probably not going to ever see the computer rush for more than 100 yards with a single back against you.   Because of this, the gameplay in Madden 2002 almost completely revolves around your ability to pass the ball and defend against the computer's passing attack. For the better or worse, most users will find that at least on the offensive side of things that this isn't a complex of a task. Whether you're playing with an average quarterback like Jay Fiedler throwing to the likes of McDuffie, Gadsden, and Goodwin or with a more potent passing attack with a Kurt Warner at the helm with weapons like Faulk, Bruce or Holt to throw to, you can expect to pass for more than 400 yards per game without much of a problem against any defense that you're thrown up against.   There are simply way too many holes open in both the long and short range passing attacks and most can be exploited at will on every difficulty except for the Madden level. The most notable are the deep corner patterns by the tight ends or slot receivers, most outs by the wide outs or just about any pass to a running back coming out of the backfield. And if you want to see even more wide open players try motioning a back to the trips side of a formation as there will always be at least one player left completely wide open in one of these situations.  To even things out a bit, actually stopping the computer's passing attack can be a mighty fine chore on the game's top two difficulty settings. The reason for this, though, isn't a sophisticated passing attack by the computer as much as it is a result of somewhat shoddy player control. When in control of a defense back going trying to defend a pass, you'll often find that trying to deflect or intercept a pass will put you into an animation that takes you out of the play if you don't knock down or catch the ball, creating a big play for the computer. This often makes playing defense more of a crapshoot than anything else.  Some of the AI and balance problems with the running and passing games can be fixed a bit if you mess around with the overall difficulty and tweak the game's AI sliders, but finding a perfect balance isn't going to happen regardless of how much time you spend fine-tuning these options. Furthermore, the CPU's play calling can be somewhat idiotic at times. The computer will pass more than it should when it has a lead and should be trying to run out the clock and it rarely runs an efficient two-minute offense when trying to mount a late game comeback.  Outside of these AI and play balance issues, there are also some other minor problems with the gameplay that are worth mentioning. For one, receivers don't react realistically to being close to the sidelines or the back of the end zone. If you're throwing an out to a receiver close to the sideline, he won't adjust his route to compensate being close to the side of the field, so if you throw the ball too late, he'll just run his pattern out of bounds. This also happens when throwing to receivers running towards the back of the end zone.   Even with all of these niggling problems, the game can still be played with a bit of realism as long as you choose not to over-exploit the holes. If you call a realistic game and try and play the game as the team you're using would really play, you're going to get a more lifelike gaming experience. Even still, striking this balance should've been something left up to the way the game was designed and not a choice by the user.  Online Play One of the biggest complaints that people had with last year's Madden was that the online play seemed a bit slow and a little too buggy. For the most part, these problems have been addressed and are no longer serious issues. There is some lag to deal with, though, so trying to get a good running game going will be much more effort than it's worth because the timing of jukes and stiff arms will be a bit off, but the game is still highly playable if you can deal with the fact that you're going to be passing the ball a lot more than you'll be running it.  It's pretty easy to jump onto EA's online chat room for the game and finding someone to go up against won't be too hard as there are usually anywhere from 20 to 30 players hanging around the main room at any one time. The biggest issue will be finding someone that'll keep on playing for a whole game as most will quit once they start losing, which means that you won't get the ~W~ on your record or the complete satisfaction of beating down another human controlled opponent.  The online competition will generally be a bit more satisfying and well rounded than you're going to get from the CPU, so this is probably one of the game's strongest assets. It's just too bad that the running game is a bit disadvantaged or this could've brought the game's score up a few points.   For those looking for more than just a single game competition either in scrimmage or league play, Madden 2002 also allows for franchise mode play online. With this, players can setup an online franchise that can be played with up to a total of 31 players with one person designated as the commissioner to setup specific rules, regulations and play times. I honestly haven't been able to check out this in depth because a combination of time restraints and the fact that I didn't want to jump into someone's franchise just to bail out before its completion, but it seems like a worthwhile option for those that want to make use of it.  Graphics Based on last year's PlayStation 2 engine with some improvements, this year's Madden on PC is without a doubt the best looking football game, or better yet, the best looking sports game that you're going to find on a computer gaming platform. The player models are highly detailed, with details such as hair on a player's arm and the mesh on his jersey being very distinguishable.  The models are also accurately sized so that the Marvin Harrison's of the league are discernible from the Tony ~Goose~ Siragusa's based on the way the player bodies appear. There are some players with fat jiggly rolls, while others are slender with muscular arms and legs, while most appear somewhere in between.   Player animation is another area where this game is miles beyond its competition on the PC. All of the players animate realistically and all move and react like their real-life counterparts. The way that quarterbacks drop back in the pocket, running backs take hand-offs and perform juke and spin moves, and the way that offensive lineman will take a drop step before pulling around end all look just like the real thing.   The only problem here lies within some of the transitional animation between player movements. In moving from one animation to another, there are often moments where the player will seem stiff and un-lifelike. Maybe it's because the other animation is so good, but these key frames between movements really stand out more this year than in year's past.   Furthermore, the collision detection between players is often a bit shoddy. While tackles offer up lifelike animation and physics based results, users will often notice that the tackler and ball carrier won't necessarily completely touch when they hit each other, lessening the visual impact of some big hits.   In spite of these little nitpicks, this is still a great looking football game. When running the game at resolutions of 1024x768 or higher with all the details turned up, it's quite arguable that there's not another sports game that looks as good on any platform. The lighting is amazing, as the time of day is completely apparent based on how the sun is shining on the players on the field, and the reflections on the players' helmets are simply out of this world.   Sound This has really been a weak spot for the Madden series for the past several years and there's no sign that things are going to get any better in the near future. The commentary work by John Madden and Pat Summerall is as dry and repetitive as ever. Just like in real life, all Madden does is state the obvious and half the time it doesn't even seem as if he and his cohort are even watching the game that you are.  The commentary doesn't adjust to what's happening in the game, as they sound pretty much the same whether you're up by 40 points with second left or if you're trailing by six with a few seconds remaining on the clock with the ball on insider your opponent's 20. With the advancements that have been made in technology over the years and the extra space provided by today's larger hard drives, one would think that we'd see some big improvements with this aspect of the game, but what we've been given here is just more of the same.   Things don't really get all that much better with the general sound effects and crowd noises. The sound effects themselves for these things aren't all that bad, but once again -- it's pretty bare bones in the way it's implemented. The crowd reaction during plays is pretty tame and you won't hear the home crowd explode as a big hit is being made and most of the changes with the crowd noise occur before and after the play and never during.   One might assume that since this year's PC game is a port of a highly-rated PlayStation 2 game that it would be a worthwhile game, even if a bit of a rehash. But the sad truth of the matter is that while Madden NFL 2001 on PS2 seemed good for its time, the gameplay engine hasn't really aged that well and the game's AI holes are more noticeable than ever. And when you take into account that the control isn't nearly as responsive as it was on the consoles, what you have here is a game that's not even as good as the one it's based on.  The online play helps make it easier to find a worthwhile opponent, but users will quickly find that even against other human opponents that you'll have to agree to work within certain restrictions to keep the game balanced -- no moving players around before the snap of the ball, as to eliminate some money plays.   But even with the online play that supports scrimmages, league play and even franchise mode play, plus other extras like the ability to create a team with a custom logo and the like, the flaws in the gameplay balance and CPU will keep this from being a must-have title for PC football fans. It's an okay, but unfulfilling experience that really could've and should've been much better.  -- Dave Zdyrko", "date": "Aug 27, 2001"}
