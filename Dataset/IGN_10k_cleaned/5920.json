Suzuki TT Superbikes does exactly that with a racing game that is not exactly spectacular for most everyone who would ever come across it. For those who really want to race in the Isle of Man of some amped-up road rockets, then here's your game and we wish you all the best while we stand off to the side a bit, playing some of the other racing games on the market.   Suzuki TT Superbikes meticulously recreates the full 37.73 miles of the Isle of Man circuit. And if that means nothing to you, then there's really no point in even reading any further. With a motorcycle game wrapped around that course that hovers comfortably in decent territory there's really so reason to check out what this has to offer. There are loads of cool bikes, but the star of the show is truly the circuit itself. Not being a huge fan myself (OK, not at all) of the Isle of Man circuit, it's difficult to see the appeal of such a track.   Since the Isle of Man circuit takes place on public roads, it is filled with straightaways and gentle turns. The most vicious turns are hard angles at intersections where the angle is 90 degrees or less. The countryside looks pleasant enough and the turns require some work to be able to speed through them at high speeds, but they lack the variety that is presented in other real-life tracks or even artificial tracks in other games. The only imaginable appeal of driving such a route is simply that you might've watched riders race through this circuit on television and wanted to recreate the experience.   As for the driving itself, the controls themselves are well done with admirable control of the bikes. After taking some time to get used to the controls, the bikes can be finessed through the turns using both analog sticks for steering and throttle/brake or a combination of analog stick and buttons. And if the expert controls are a little too tricky, there's always the novice option where the bikes automatically decelerate going into the turns.   As for the racing against the other bikes, the AI is good enough to provide some competition. They don't all follow the same line and even have a tendency to spread themselves out far away from each other during the races. Fighting for position in a pack tends to only happen in the beginning of the race and the main action ends up being jockeying for first place against one or two other racers. It's a shame that the feeling of fighting against a group of equal riders isn't in here, but there's still some challenge.    And while there are many strides in making this a simulation game, the action can still feel a little arcade-y. The track is real, the physics feel good, and you're not going to safely make it through a tight turn at 120 mph, but the effect of hitting other bikes is pretty comical. Ramming another bike from behind will send it into a forward flip and it's easy to force another bike off the side of the road or into a wall to take them out of the race. It's still nothing like Road Rash, but it does have its moments.   Even if the track itself is not enough of a selling point to bring in non-fans, at least there's a good selection of bikes from 125cc all the way up to 1000cc and even some sidecars to choose from. It may not makes the course more exciting, but at least they go faster and faster and require some better hand-eye coordination. There's definitely that going for it.   Where the graphics in Suzuki TT Superbikes are not all that impressive with some flat textures and relatively simple environments and character models, the engine still runs silky smooth. At all times it's easy to see what's going on and know exactly what the bike is doing. There are no framerate drops in critical situations and even at the highest speeds the graphics engine keeps pace with no problems.    After racing around the tracks and trying out the different bikes it's apparent that while Suzuki TT Superbikes does a decent job as a motorcycle racing game, it still doesn't do anything to make it stand out and ends up as something resembling a blank slate, waiting for some more tracks and personality to be invested into it. The Isle of Man is most notable for its realism if not the excitement of racing along it. Once again, if you're a fan who desperately wants to see the race from a first-person perspective this will scratch that itch, but there are many other titles such as the upcoming MotoGP 4 that explore the territory much further.", "date": "Aug 11, 2005"}
