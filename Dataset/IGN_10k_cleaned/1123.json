Konami's ISS series, on the more expensive consoles at least, is generally thought to be the best representation of the sport; here, they attempt to dispel allegations that the handheld simply isn't suited to such a genre and prove that a bit of dedication is all that's needed to work around the technical limitations.  Features: 32 international teams A variety of different tactics and formations Exhibition matches International Cup tournament mode Penalty Kick practice mode Link-cable compatibility Password Save. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color.   This game impressed me right from the start: even before you begin play, you're greeted with a wide range of options. Everything that you'd expect to be present is, including practice games, a tournament option (though it doesn't adhere to the official setup, since Konami has no licence), penalty kicks, which are viewed from the classic 'behind the shooter' perspective, and, best of all, a two-player link mode -- the developers seemed to have crammed in nearly all of the options found in the 'proper' ISS games.   Before starting the actual match, you have an impressive amount of control over your team. There's a wide variety of formations to choose from, ranging between the sensible and the suicidal, and even a list of tactics that will determine how your team will play -- these can also be changed by accessing the menu screen at any point during the game, so if you want to play offensive until a goal is scored then pull all your men back to defend, you can. I didn't expect to find this level of detail in a Game Boy port, but Konami has successfully implemented the vast majority of the options found in the originals.  Unlike most Game Boy soccer games, which employ either an overhead or isometric perspective, ISS is viewed from the side. The graphics really are good: each of the 32 teams is given a recognizable color, such as blue for France and black for Germany; and there's no slowdown at all, even when the pitch gets clogged up with players and action. The sprites themselves are not particularly detailed, but they do their job admirably, meaning that the game actually looks like a scaled-down version of its siblings, rather than a bastardisation, with everything present in a basic form.  But any football game can only be as good as how it plays. Fortunately for ISS, that rule means the game is very good indeed. The experience is hardly silky smooth, but the controls are tight and responsive, never stopping you from manoeuvring how you want and allowing players to dribble the ball in skilful circuits before charging in for the goal. Konami has done an impressive job in converting the controls over to the hand-held's measly two buttons: one is used to pass, the other to shoot -- and when not in possession of the ball, both are used for tackling, either aggressively or softly. The only worrying sacrifice is the absence of a 'change player' button, but the computer is fairly sensible in handling it automatically, assigning control to the player nearest to the ball.   Your teammates possess AI that is easily functional, sticking to formations and following whatever tactics you have set. The goalkeepers are incredibly skilled, saving many shots that any other game would easily have seen in the net -- though since this works both ways, whether it's a fault or not is down to individual preference. Corners, throw-ins, goal kicks and fouls are all present and correct, ensuring that the game plays as it should do.  The only thing that could realistically be improved upon is the sound. Rather than the cheering of the crowd, a selection of music tracks play during each match -- and, to put it bluntly, they are all terrible and completely inappropriate for a football game. Sure, a Game Boy can't create the same atmosphere as more advanced consoles, but a digitised crowd noise -- rather than any proper music -- would have been far better and actually fit the mood of the game.  This would've also let Konami improve the sound effects, which are neither particularly convincing nor effective, especially where the ball is concerned.  Exceptional mechanics and presentation unmatched on a handheld combine to produce a wonderful game, ideal for footy fans who want a game on the move, with passwords to save progress in the International Cup. Konami has proven that the Game Boy is very capable of handling such a title, turning out something far closer to the PSX and N64 versions than I would have thought possible. I look forward to seeing what they can do with the franchise on the Game Boy Advance.Note: ISS '99 is currently only available in Europe  Konami has no plans on bringing this game to the US.
