Make a bad game, eh, who cares about bad games. Make a good game with a couple flaws, so it goes. But make a game where everything is there, everything is fun, everything is hot, everything is great EXCEPT for that one thing, and it's all over. That one thing will drive you batty and run your enjoyment of the game into a wall every time. Every freakin' time.  Kim Possible has one thing wrong with it, and it makes enjoying the rest of this otherwise hot game nearly impossible.  Features   Whack Dr. Drakken and Monkey Fist's baddies with Kim Possible's arsenal of kicks and acrobatics Ring up Wade on the Kimmunicator and smack up enemies with Kim's killer gadgets Roam (if you want to) all over the globe in locations from Middleton High to Paris, France Only for Game Boy Advance   Produced for Disney Interactive by Digital Eclipse, Kim Possible for the Game Boy Advance has our super swinging scholastic superhero dashing all about the globe to deliver a pain-o-gram on the forces of Shego, Monkey Fist and Doctor Drakken. It's a quality production of a beat-em-up, with gorgeous sprite animation and FMV sprinkled throughout the cart. It's one of those nicely ambitious action games on GBA that delivers a little something more than the standard tap-tap-tap of the B-button to punch baddies, giving Kim a few extra moves and more advanced tricks to learn and make use of to find hidden areas and provide a little extra challenge. Keen in concept, but guess what they got wrong?  Yep -- it's the little added extras that make this would-be hotty an ugly scud. Most specifically, there's a move in the game where Kim can cartwheel into a super-jump that's genius in design and blockheaded in execution. If you remember the handstand jump in Donkey Kong GB (and if not, immediately track that gem down, pop it in, and say ~Hello MiyaMOTO~), you'll get what the designers of Kim Possible were going for here. But whereas DK let you stick perfect leaps and landings, this game launches you off the wrong leg with a narrow jump arc that misses the target most times and a take-off approach that requires somewhere around a million miles of cartwheeling. You can bet that if the jump you were attempting actually comes off in a jump (assuming you just don't go cartwheeling into a bottomless pit as you wail on the jump button), you can be sure that you'll get a second chance to screw it up again since you'll be missing the thing you were jumping for most every time. Parallax scrolling and detailed animation are usually a blessing, but in this case, they get in the way of the gameplay and make for timing this move just right to always be wrong. Once the designers let off the basics and bring up the challenge of using the technique more, the game is done and no fun.  Other than that one thing -- that one simple, stupid, stupid thing -- Kim Possible is a thrilling quickie brawler. It's got some problems with being too tough for kids in cases (limited continues is pretty harsh on Saturday Morning Cartoon addicts.) Also, the level design gets brutal in the last few stages after some enjoyable runs in the beginning [Seriously, DE -- what the hell with that Factory stage and that backwards-facing wall leap over a pit with about a fingernail's width of space to work with after nine deadly pits ... and then a roll-under that you have to time JUST RIGHT at the very next pit!?!]  Those problems, plus the password instead of a battery back-up and a bug or two that really don't impact the gameplay (there's supposed to be a context-sensitive pop-up on the Kimmunicator about using the teleporters that doesn't show until long after it's supposed to -- apparently the manual writers had the same problem since they wrote the button down wrong for the move), are the only damage on an otherwise good adaptation of the kick-butt cartoon show. Kim's flaming orange hair and buff fighting attitude come through in killer animation that flairs its style better than the show it's based on, and the explosions wallop anything you've seen in most sprite-based games (or PlayStation games, for that matter.) The girl's got a lot of moves and a few gadgets to boot, and it all comes across in tight controls (except for that ONE dang super-jump move...) Level design isn't brilliant, but it's a fun romp for kids (until you have to make perfect jumps with that ONE dang move...) And the music is a funky spy groove that makes use of multiple GBA channels for authentic sound from the show (aside from way that Kim grunts like an old lady when she's punched ... which is hardly as annoying as that ONE dang move...)   Kim Possible is another case of a game caught up in the Christmas rush -- everything is there and polished except for one simple thing, and that one simple thing acid-washes the whole outfit. It was never great to begin with, but the GBA is starving for action, so this would have fit the bill perfectly if they had just polished that one aspect and let kids enjoy the whole thing. The ~sitch~, as Kim would say, is that this game is just too much the drama.", "date": "Jan 10, 2003"}
