But let's face it, the videogame world is due for surfing game, right? Already we have a bucketload of snowboard, skateboard, and an oncoming rash of BMX games. So, we do need a surfing game, yeah? Well, the good folks at Rockstar gladly want to fulfill our need for a PS2 surfing game. And it just so happened that Ascii released a sub-par game in Japan about three months ago, so putting the two together made perfect sense. Of course, Rockstar may have simply missed one big thing -- this game is a dud.   Gameplay Known as Surfroid by about three Japanese gamers in the Far East, Surfing H30 brings gamers a fully 3D surfing game that enables players to pick from an initial eight fictional characters who pull off tricks, collect strange, colored buoys for points, and try to reach a goal line under a time limit in imaginary contests. It features a whopping two gameplay modes, is incredibly short, and is one of the worst titles on PS2 by a longshot. In my eyes the game is flawed in so many ways, I'm a little surprised that Rockstar picked it up at all -- it's awkward to control, it's slow, it's stupid, it's not about surfing, and it's riddled with technical problems that make even the simplest of tasks dissatisfying.   From the top: Players pick from two different difficulty levels to begin the game, easy and intermediate. As they beat each difficulty level, they open up new ones, such as semi pro, pro, etc. From there they pick a character, anyone of eight gnarly surfers -- men and women curiously familiar names such as Kelly Sunset (Kelly Slater, anyone?) -- and get to pick a colored board. The board selection is purely insubstantial, because in truth they all perform the same. You then check out your menus and can see a tutorial, which is helpful. You then start your ride.   The novelty finger-surfboard that comes with this game is probably one of the coolest things about it. It sticks onto your dual analog buttons, and enables you to ~surf~ the buttons via a surfboard, which you push up and down. Just to clarify, if you take the little board off the buttons, the game is almost impossible to play, so make sure not to throw this puppy to the dogs. To paddle, you alternately press the shoulder buttons, and then to jump up, you simultaneously press the two dual shocks down. And then presto, you're surfing.   The gameplay functions in this game are simple, collect buoys for points, acquire points for tricks, and get tubed for points. If you beat the time limit, you'll receive another 100 points, too. But the actual execution of the tricks is quite a trial. Just like Ubi Soft's Surf Riders, it's truly possible to do the moves, but you'll be exhausted and annoyed and disgusted once you learn just how they're done, and how how lame they look and feel. First you use the meter on the screen to determine how fast you're going, then you aim up toward the lip and press an L button to pull off moves. Once in the air, you press various L buttons to pull off mutes, nose grabs, 360s, and others.   Once you get to the later levels, you're required to pull off more moves, and the waves are bigger and more dangerous. This is where the shaky gameplay is foiled with shoddy control, poor camera angles, and butt-faced design. First, the camera is slow, and it follows your surfer from a straight third-person perspective. If you find yourself in the tube, you may not be able to see yourself, or if you do, the wave may cut you off, and bring you into a netherland of white wash and mangled polygon craziness. If you happen to pull off a trick the camera may swing around your surfer as you spin, but it may stay focused on you from the front of the surfer, which affects the way you perform the moves. Finally, the sense of speed is null. Speed? What's that? How about some corn?   There are only two real modes in this game. The Challenge and the two-player modes. Challenge is made up about four wave sets, both lefts and rights, with a couple different wave sizes. You work your way through the challenge, and you beat it. I beat the intermediate level without learning any tricks. Oh, and did I mention that I beat the intermediate mode in less than 20 minutes? The two-player mode enables you to take turns in a two-person contest. The idea of ~depth~ here is that you play through all of the difficulty levels, which simply hang refining tricks and playing the three to four wave sets over and over. In other words, the replay value is, in the vernacular, weak sauce.  OK, so the control is awkward. The camera angles are glitchy. There are control problems. The game is shallow. How about the surfing? If you get this game will you feel like you're surfing? If you try really hard, and stretch your imagination, you might, possibly feel like you're surfing. But it won't come easy.   On occasion, the game does deliver some breath-taking glimpses of surfing. After pulling off a trick, the camera, hovering in a high, third-person angle, sees you swooping down the face of the wave, and it feels right on. You feel the steep drop and the rush, and it feels similar to dropping down a roller coaster. The waves vary in size and they bigger they get the more intimidated you feel -- that's nice, however fleeting a feeling. The accompanying sound also creates a little shot of adrenaline and fear, too. The sense of full 3D movement is...there. It exists. You can move in 3D. You are on a wave. You do move about. But because of the shallow control scheme you'll never feel like you're actually surfing.  But on the whole, the core game concept is bunk. The whole idea is shoddy. Collect buoys while you ride along a wave? What they hell? Where is the skill required to learn different kinds of waves? What about a huge set of different breaks that provide wild degrees of difference in steepness, tube size, speed, power, etc.? Why not make games that focus on the skills of surfing and that focuses on varying skills in surfers? Like some might be better at riding big waves, while others might be total trick masters? And then there's the whole board size and shape thing. The selection in boards here in meaningless.   If you want to surf, or play a surfing videogame, go get Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 or 2 and play that for awhile (it's the next best thing to a surfing game) until Activision brings out Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer. Either that or simply learn how to surf.   Graphics Surfing H30 does some neat things visually. There really isn't much to look at except for the wave, the surfer, and the distant, 2D background that you never reach. The character models are relatively large and the level of detail is better than decent. The backgrounds are insignificant because they are all simple paintings.   That leaves the waves. The waves are a mix of beauty and the swamp thing's butt. The bigger ones are awesome in size and provide a sense of raw power. The waves are just giant walls, and they're not complex, or fluid like real waves. They're totally predictable and mechanical. ASCII did create a beautiful set of water textures and transparencies. The water splits around your board and the white wash looks pretty decent, too. But back to the waves: They're all frothy, messy indecipherable barrels of mush. There are hollow bits to them, but it's difficult to determine how far back you can go in, where to sit and get tubed, and the camera angle is simply cut off by the peeling wall. That's just weak.   Lastly, I miss the absolutely ridiculous story from the Japanese verion (~Surfroid is surfer of the legend.~). The whole idea of a meteor crashing into the moon, from which a shard crashes into Earth to create huge waves is super silly, but it's cute and funny in a way.   Sound The best thing about this game's sound is the waves themselves. They have this ominous roaring sound that, as you get closer, get louder and more disturbing. The wave sounds, however good, make up about half of the game's sound. Rockstar tried to make this game ~rad,~ with alternative music and like ~bitchin~ phrases uttered from the like bleached out Caucasian characters. It's a typical localization process, but the silly monsters and aliens weren't so bad. OK, they were, but they were silly bad. These new characters are just plain old boring. Luckily, as you open up the game, these silly characters appear. But as for the vocals, most surfers don't usually say that much. The just look at you and then they go surfing. If you haven't guessed I don't think much of this game. The reasons: a) it's a horribly designed thing, and b) it's not so much about surfing as it is about collecting stuff. It's a fluff piece that has waves in it, but somehow skips the surfing part altogether. And I thought Rockstar wanted to put out games with gameplay! This much have skipped the regular approval process or something...Anyway, don't rent it. Just move on.", "date": "Nov 4, 2000"}
