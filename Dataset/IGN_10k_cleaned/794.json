{"name": "Stephen King's F13", "name_review": "Stephen King's F13", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/21/stephen-kings-f13", "text": "~I never cared much about computer games  -- they're strictly for dickbrains...~ reads a sentence in the Stephen King novella ~Everything's Eventual~, that is included on Blue Byte Software's Stephen King's F13. Consider that sentiment to be the driving force behind this is a mishmash of screensavers and timewasters, because that's the audience that this is seemingly aimed at, and it's what you'd have to be to plunk down $20 for this crap.  Here's what you get besides the aforementioned novella: Seven uninspiring screen savers  (Evil Genius at work, It's just lightning, Stephen King Trivia, Creature in my room, and more), 10 screen savers called ~Deathtop Backgrounds~ (Gargoyle, Terror Eyes, Hearse, etc.), 20 system sounds (floor creak, ghost, screams, maniac, etc.), and three moronic games (No Swimming, Bug Splat, and Whack-A-Zombie).   Most companies just give away screen savers and wallpaper, and the free stuff is generally better than what comes in this collection. If you want to charge for this type of thing, than Berkeley's After Dark collection of flying toasters and other charming screen savers is the model you should strive to emulate. Seeing a screen saver of a bedroom with an evil doll that changes position every time the lightning flashes is terrifying? What's next? Evil tricycles? And in a testament to the ultimate laziness of Blue Byte and Presto Studios, all of these lame sounds, screen savers, and wallpapers come with no install utility. Instead you are directed to use Windows to install them. For $20 they couldn't have written an install utility?  The games included are dumb and completely boring. Yes, ~No Swimming~ is amusing for about 15 seconds. You pick up one of five animals (a little doggie, a horse, a rhino, etc.) and drop it into a pond of piranha and watch it get devoured. Rinse and repeat. That's it for that ~game.~ ~Bug Splat~ has you smash roaches with a fly swatter at first, then a newspaper, and god knows what else next -- I was in danger of lapsing into a coma, so I had to stop. You swat a few, and then the next ~level~ has a few more, and so on. ~Whack-A-Zombie~ is exactly what you think it is, except they're skeletons popping up out of graves instead of zombies  yeah, this is the handiwork of Nobel laureates, folks.   The Everything's Eventual novella is the only thing worthwhile in this collection, and as far as King stories go, it's a bit on the weak side. It's probably the book equivalent of 40-50 pages, although on the CD it's 84 pages long. It's never been published in book form before, but it's undoubtedly been published in a magazine or anthology so most ardent King fans have likely read it. I couldn't find the publication credits for it anywhere on the CD or on the CD sleeve, which doubles for documentation, but if it was a brand new story, I'm sure they would have splashed that all over the box. (Strangely, King actually has a story about an F13 key on a computer, but Everything's Eventual certainly isn't it.)  If you're a King completist, you might consider owning this story reason enough to waste $20, but everyone else should steer clear. Spend your $20 on some Stephen King paperbacks and run screaming into the night as fast as you can in the opposite direction of this collection. It's horrific for all the wrong reasons.   -- Mark Asher", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
