{"name": "Fighter Maker 2", "name_review": "Fighter Maker 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/18/fighter-maker-2", "text": "is another one of those games that confounds criticism.  Is it good?  Well, good compared to what?  Other fighter-making games?  What other fighter-making games?  It is perhaps not that good when compared to a commercial 3D animation package, but you can't compare a $50 game to thousands of dollars worth of computer software, either.  Some other creation engines are catching up on it in a few areas -- the newest WWE SmackDown! has superior cosmetic editing features, and it's making a go at animation editing as well -- but they're still nowhere near Enterbrain in its specific area of expertise.  So this is not so much a review as a collection of suggestions and advice.  If you want to try and create a 3D fighting game without the benefit of a small fortune in computer equipment, software, and development licenses, this is what you want to get.  You are warned, however, that it can be an extremely frustrating experience, limited by an occasionally backwards interface and clumsy preview controls.  The results may be rewarding, but I personally can't predict what another gamer might get out of this one.  Gameplay A bit of a misnomer, that, because this is not a game.  It's a system for editing character models, move sequences, and animations, so as to allow the user to create characters for use in a pre-packaged 3D fighting engine.  There are some pre-created fighters to play with, but buying the game to just fiddle with the sample characters would be like buying a Corvette and never driving past the speed limit.  There are three main editing systems: the body editor, where you determine a fighter's appearance; the sequence editor, where you assign move commands and chain moves together to create combos; and the animation editor, the most complex of all, where you edit moves frame by frame to determine how they play out on screen.  Each has its own problems and limitations, but a few are common to all three.  The primary difficulty I found in every mode was the cumbersome preview control.  To move around the model being edited in any mode requires toggling out of the main editor (losing control over the task at hand) and switching over to a separate set of preview controls.  Furthermore, those controls make it difficult to view the model from a perspective that doesn't look straight down a particular axis.  The ability to split up the screen into multiple preview windows helps somewhat, but I'd still rather be able to just move the camera around on the fly.  In this regard, I think I'm badly spoiled by the system in the last SmackDown game, which used the dual analog sticks to let you easily rotate the character models around all three axes.  Indeed, that game used the analog sticks for all kinds of editing features, although those controls would probably be too haphazard for manipulating animation and model details in Fighter Maker.  Actually manipulating the animation details isn't too difficult, once you get the proper perspective in the preview window.  It's easy to move from frame to frame in order to get an idea of what the final animation will look like and tweak individual frames.  The process is certainly tedious, but there's nothing that can be done about that -- there's no way to make this kind of work quick and simple.  What the system lacks in user-friendliness it makes up for in versatility, offering control over every salient point on the character model.      The sequence editor is a little more forgiving in comparison.  This is where combinations are made, stringing particular moves together in a proper sequence.  Here, it's possible to edit things like damage, priority, command input, and time frames, so as to provide openings for combo delays or demand more precise timing for certain moves.  I don't think it's possible to implement an interruptible move like Ivy's Summon Suffering in Soul Calibur (its complex direction inputs makes it possible to launch other attacks in between beginning and concluding the SS command input), but it's certainly possible to create some nasty timing a la the Stun Palm combination in Virtua Fighter, or a branching combo with different concluding strikes that follow the same starting move.  As for the cosmetic editing features, I would always like to have a wider array of body parts and facial features, but there are only a few specific holes in Fighter Maker 2's selection of parts.  For example, there's an upper-body part for a judo or aikido gi jacket, but no corresponding hakama for the legs to create the kendo goddess of my dreams.  This I deem a significant oversight.  Otherwise, while it would certainly be nice to have more versatile features -- a texture editor for decals, perhaps -- and a wider selection of parts, it's hard to complain in a situation where there's no alternative.  That's what inevitably comes to mind when contemplating Fighter Maker 2's flaws.  It would be possible to make a far, far better game in this genre -- spruce up the bare-bones interface, provide more helpful preview windows, implement a detailed animation preview feature, design more model parts, add tutorial and help features throughout to prevent newbies from getting lost, and make real use of the plethora of inputs on the Dual Shock to let the user manipulate more variables at once.  But it's still possible to build some impressive creations with the tools Enterbrain provides here, and the dedicated should give Fighter Maker 2 a look as a consequence.  Graphics The graphics are not the point here, of course.  Which is lucky for Fighter Maker 2, because it's a very unassuming game visually, with very limited textures and significant aliasing all round.  The stock backgrounds are surprisingly good in comparison -- there's a nice sendup of the Shibuya stage in Tekken 4, for example -- but even those are pretty low on detail in comparison to the top of the line in the fighting genre proper.  Which is no knock against the game, really, merely a warning to the few who might for some reason consider this a point integral to their purchasing decision.  The game's character animation, of course, is as good as you can make it.  So go to it.Or not, as the case may be.  Most of you will probably choose ~not,~ in fact.  This is not a mainstream gamer's game.  This is a quirky hobbyist's game, a game for people with the inhuman patience and attention to detail required to build garage kits, program in assembly language, or play Advanced Squad Leader on a regular basis.  Those few will get past its cumbersome qualities and perhaps create something pretty special.  The rest of us, of course, will simply pass it by.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
