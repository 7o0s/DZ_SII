Well, like a 50s radio station deejay might say, ~The hits just keep on coming.~ Now the Irish publisher/developer has secured Special K's most famous shooter franchise, Gradius, and we got our mitts on the go-go results of UG's localization efforts.  Features:  Three difficulty levels High score rankings Auto-fire option Selectable special weapons Gradius, man. Gradius!  There are a handful of shooters that inspire shock and awe in the few gamers that stil gorge themselves on the waning genre -- about most of them are made by Treasure. But Konami's side-scrolling blaster, Gradius, belongs in that upper pantheon of great classics, too. Its trademark special weapons select system, tight control, fascinating art direction (whoever decided to throw in Easter Island heads is a genius), and spectacular boss battles wooed gamers out of many a quarter, as well as much of their allowance as the home versions kept on coming.  Upstart Games and Konami have crafted a wholly impressive to-go portion of Gradius -- complete with all of the trimmings. After zeroing in on, and defeating a few memorable bosses, you realize this isn't just a port of Gradius; this is Gradius.  Now, we've discussed before the nagging control issues that have plagued handset shooters: phones will not allow multiple button inputs at the same time. To offset this, Gradius offers an auto-fire option. Is it pure? No, but try playing the game without out. You'll see your ship explode so many time you'll fear burn-in. Auto-fire keeps the laser pulses coming, but it doesn't necessarily make the game any easier. Enemies still fire back, and your beams don't wipe those bullets off the screen.  The goal of Gradius is the same of any shooter -- destroy everything on-screen. But Gradius makes this formula fresh by offering a then (and still) innovative special weapons select that allows you to upgrade your ship on the fly. As you pick up power-ups, a bar on the bottom of your screen becomes active. Each power-up advances the selection of the bar. If you want to upgrade speed, press ~5~ when the ~SPD~ option is lit. If you want lasers, collect several power-ups to move the selection highlight over.  Gradius even includes the ~options~ that flank your ship on each side, blasting out the same weapons your craft uses. For an incredible powerhouse, try to get two options with lasers. Goose your speed a couple times and the enemy doesn't have a chance.  That is, until you screw up.  Get hit and you lose all of your upgrades. This is particularly difficult if to croak during a boss battle. The bosses in Gradius are merciless; you need those upgrades to turn the tide. The game will scoot you back a few screens and allow you to collect a few power-ups before confronting the boss again, but by no means to you have enough juice to get al of your boom-boom back.  If we had a single beef with the game, it's that the screen is too small horizontally. That's not Konami's fault, Upstart's fault, or Matt Damon's fault. It's just the way cellphone screens are, so the amount of real estate available for seeing incoming foes has been effectively halved. That changes some of the game's dynamics, but not enough to ruin anything by any means.  Gradius is absolutely amazing to look at on the small screen. This is the classic shooter. Everything is correctly colored, the sprites are dead-on. The ship actually has frames of animation for when it moves up and down. Konami made sure that the special weapons bar is big enough to be easily read and used, but it doesn't take away too much of the playing field. And the boss battles? Oh, bubbe they're to die for. The game is fully stocked with sound effects, too. Over the game's familiar soundtrack, you head each shot and explosion. Double wowza. I have a real soft spot for Gradius -- which was equal parts blessing and curse as I booted up the game. If it was the stunning recreation that it is, I was gonna be pleased. If it was anything less, I would start looking for a dog to kick. Upstart and Konami has again stretched the expectations of what a handset game is capable of. It's good to see the shooter genre exploding on handsets, thanks to a fab series of fantastic games. When Upstart Game gets a deal in place to bring this game to American carriers, you must download it.", "date": "Feb 25, 2004"}
