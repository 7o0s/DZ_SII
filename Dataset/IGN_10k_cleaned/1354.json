Call it a lack of interest.  Call it a lack of rhythm.  Call it a lack of self-confidence in a society driven by insecurity and commercial brainwashing at the hands of relentless, manipulative marketing efforts.  Whatever.  The bottom line is, gamers in the US don't dance.  They don't shake that groove thang, and most certainly do not play games that involve rhythm happy Mexican monkeys who are all about the maracas.  It makes you wonder what the hell Sega was thinking when they went out on a limb to bring their arcade phenom, Samba De Amigo to the States.  Well, we already knew after playing the import, but for those of you who weren't fortunate enough to negotiate the acquisition of the considerably hard-to-find release, we've got some good news: the domestic version is finally here and Sega was thinking that, every once in a while, someone has to go out on a limb and save the gaming community from its own ignorance by delivering a product that is so energetic, so imaginative, so enjoyable that one can't help but be a slave to the shake.  That title is Samba De Amigo and if you don't have any plans to go pick it up, stop for a second.  Ask yourself a really simple question: ~Do I hate having fun?~  If the answer is yes, jump off a cliff, and take your copy of Superman 64 with you.  You're killing my favorite industry.   If however, you are one of the hardcore who knows a revolution when they see it, or even just one of those casual cats who isn't afraid to let your hair down and act the fool, then by all means, proceed, and see why, immediately following this review, you're going to go purchase the best damn rhythm game ever made. Samba De Amigo truly rocks the house.  Unlike some music games that require severe amounts of physical conditioning and quick feet, all you need to know how to do here is move your arms to one of three positions and shake your wrist.  It's ain't that tricky folks, and despite requiring an $80.00 accessory, it is easily the most accessible music game we've ever played when it comes to control.  Granted, when compared to the arcade version, the Maracas peripheral isn't quite as solid or accurate, but thankfully, they are relatively inexpensive, and certainly less heavy, which is a major blessing in light of how tiring even they can become if you're as out of shape as I am.  The accuracy isn't always on par, and is actually the only major knock I have on this game, aas every now and then, an obvious hit will not register, and it can really mess you up in some of the challenges. The thing is,  this is pretty rare, and all things considered, the fact that the maracas came home at all is a minor miracle.  Overall, we're incredibly happy with that aspect of the translation.  Another plus for Samba is the music.  Almost every track made it home, and just for good measure, some of the tracks missing from the Japanese home version have hit home, including the Ricky Martin tracks, and almost everything seems to fit.  From the title track to Love Lease, these songs will get your dancing, and the shaking action is all well timed with the music.  Thanks to three levels of difficulty, everyone from your little brother to the leader of your local b-boy crew will have no trouble finding a challenge.   Which brings us to Samba's other strong point.  It has crazy appeal.  Despite the strong gaming presence inside the walls of the newly-constructed IGN fortress, We work in an office full of suits, and you'd be shocked to see how many people who saw us playing would stop and bang on the demo room door until we let them in for a go at it.  This is probably one of the best party games ever made, and thanks to the maracas, it is a game that almost everyone sees and thinks ~I could do that!~  You'll have countless hours of fun if you afford to plunk down the dough for 2 sets of maracas, as almost everyone you show this game will want a piece of the action.  The cool thing is, even the single player challenges are fun.  You may not be the life of the party, or Mom may not let you throw one, but that doesn't mean the fun has to stop.  The home version has tons of stuff to keep you busy, such as the ~party mode,~ strength and skill tests, mimicry exercises, and score challenges, all of which combine to make you a better player, not to mention a more fit gamer.  These things will give your arms and shoulders a work-out, and if you aren't afraid to get down to the music, it can really make you work up a sweat.  Before you laugh at the notion, keep in mind that this may help convince some of you fatties out  there convince Mom that she needs to plunk down the $120 bucks for the total package.   Speaking of which, the expense is another downside for the game, but I simply can't knock the game for being expensive.  I realize not everyone can afford it, but I am telling you it will be well worth it if you are thinking of saving up for it.  As a music game, Samba De Amigo just does it all.  Great music, awesome control, and awesome visuals that feature performance-based activity form the unbelievably cool cast of characters...a game like this simply does not come along that often. It is the type of title that makes me remember why I laugh when people try to tell me Sega is only in this business for the money.  Sure, Sonic Team could have brought us another NiGHTS or hurried development on PSO along, but they decided to make a game so original that it makes even the most casual gamer stand up and take notice.  They had an uphill battle bringing the experience of the arcade home with the maracas peripheral, and because they wanted to see us get our groove on, the made it happen.  Innovative, addictive, and full of life, this is the kind of title that makes me believe that games won't be dead as long as Sega is still around.    ~But Brandon, I can only afford four games this winter!!~  I know money doesn't grow on trees, but you can't put a price on brilliance, kids.  I don't care of you have to skip out on a couple other games this Fall.  If you want something fresh, something new...go buy this game.  It is the most refreshing experience I have had on my Dreamcast since I bought it last Winter, and is as much fun today as it was when I first played the arcade version nearly a year ago. Congratulations, Sega.  You may not sell too many copies, but you've made gaming a better hobby for the lucky individuals who choose to give your latest a shot.  --", "date": "Oct 19, 2000"}
