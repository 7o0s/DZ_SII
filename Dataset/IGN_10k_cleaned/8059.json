The genre has fallen out of favor with mainstream gamers -- now it's primarily the hardcore that take refuge in these twitch contests devoted to memorizing enemy and shot patterns. What remains to be seen is if this crowd is willing to engage Konami's mobile entry in the series, Gradius Neo.   Gradius Neo looks and behaves like a classic shooter. You pilot the famous Vic Viper through stage after stage of enemy ships and vessels. Sequences of smaller ships are always broken up by mid-size attack vessels. Each stage culminates in a boss encounter, typically with a rather large ship that demonstrates its considerable firepower. The only way to beat the boss is zero in on its weak spot while avoiding its ultimately predictable bullet and movement patterns.   In Gradius, power-ups to the ship are ~purcahsed~ from a string of icons along the bottom of the screen. The tokens for nabbing these extras are picked up after blasting reddish ships or clearing out an entire line of incoming invaders. Each token advances a marker on the string of icons. In Neo, you pick your power-up with the left soft key. You can buy into speed increases, missiles, or envelope your ship in a shield. However, there is a secondary line of icons in the bottom-right corner of the screen. These affect you main cannons. To select from these icons, you must pick up green tokens, often left behind by mid-size ships. The right soft key selects these special weapons.   Due to the constraints of most handsets, mobile shooters always rely on auto-fire. Sometimes, this results in either a ridiculously easy game, or an especially difficult one -- primarily because the rate of fire doesn't even remotely sync up with the enemy ships. Gradius Neo finds a happy medium. The lack of eight-way controls is hard to get used to. Four-way movement in a shooter can be tough, especially when the narrow screen is full of tiny ships and laser fire. Again, this is just part of mobile, and it highlights why we need gaming-centric handsets. Four-way control is great for Tower Bloxx and Tetris -- not so much for the action games that will bring in the hardcore crowd.   Gradius Neo shows great mercy by offering multiple difficulty levels and allowing you to elect for extra continues. Even though the game is short by console shooter standards -- only five stages -- you can be assured you're going to need those continues. After completing a level, you can also select it as a starting point during a later play session. Finally, you begin Gradius Neo with two orbital satellites, and that helps quite a bit with getting a foothold in the game.   I tested Gradius Neo on the LG Fusic (on Sprint). The text is pretty wonky -- it looks like it was sized down incorrectly. It doesn't affect the game play, but it sure does look sloppy. The in-game graphics are pretty good -- this is classic Gradius, complete with colorful Os for enemy shots, Easter Island heads for enemies, and screen-sized boss battles. Unfortunately, the sound department trails the visuals. The sound effects are minimal and not that advanced.  As a Gradius fan, I enjoyed Gradius Neo. However, I also understand the constraints of mobile and could see a hardcore shooter fan without proper expectations being severely disappointed. Auto-fire? Four-way movement? These things are hard to swallow. And what's up with only five stages? If you're in the right mindset, though, Gradius Neo provides some solid mobile shooting that fits nicely in Konami's still-strong franchise. You won't keep coming back to it, but it's a nice distraction while it lasts.", "date": "Feb 16, 2007"}
