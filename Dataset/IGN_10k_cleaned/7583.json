The arcade racing series has accompanied the PS1, PS2 and PSP system launches. Next week, on November 17, the PS3 will launch with its own iteration, titled Ridge Racer 7. Like any launch software, Sony intends to show off the power of its new console with it. And it to that effect Ridge Racer 7 mostly succeeds. It sticks to what made it popular in the first place, namely physics-shunning race dynamics, so those looking for the next step in the series will likely feel burned.   Those looking for an evolutionary step in the franchise will hit the gas and never look back. Ridge Racer 7 is, if nothing else, a vastly rewarding title that does a fine job of making racing fun, above all else. It certainly ignores the real-world physics presented by some of its peers, like Project Gotham Racing 3. It also keeps the action focused on high-speed maneuvering and less on wanton destruction, like in Burnout Revenge. But what it lacks in realism and explosions it makes up in a solid, albeit entirely unrealistic, race experience. Players will spend more time perfecting the art of drifting than anything else, but in the case of Ridge Racer 7, that's totally fine - since the developer structured the entire game around it.    At first drifting seems simple enough: just release the gas and lean in the direction of the turn. What makes the mechanic interesting, and fun more importantly, is how players need to use it to finish a race. Most beginner tracks throw out a few curves, maybe a super sharp turn or two, but later tracks force drivers to drift like it's nobody's business. Players will need to drift through a series of sharp turns at 200-plus mph with 14 other cars sailing by. Sure, just about anyone can drift when going 90 mph, but Ridge Racer 7 has little patience for that. Players either learn to drift, and drift well, or it's curtains. The game tries to help - players can access drift tutorials - but these do a poor job of teaching since they're primarily text-based and non-interactive. It's largely on the driver to learn how to best exploit the lack of real physics. The mechanic does get a little finicky at times. On certain tracks it feels like someone coated the road with gallons of lube.   That aside, everything works fine - perhaps a little too clean for some, especially after the likes of Burnout Revenge. Smashing into rival cars results in a polite little bump, not a catastrophic collision. Irresponsible driving only slows one down and never results in a spectacular crash. Cars, too, always look pristine and polished. Ridge Racer fans wouldn't have it any other way, but all of it just feels overly lenient now. Even with a dozen or more drivers on the track, players will mainly battle the clock and the course. Yes, even bumping into another car hinders speed, or worse, messes with a drift. And being rear-ended can, in fact, cause a spinout, but this rarely happens. The worst offender by far is hitting the side of the track. Once a player has advanced to later courses with high-end machines, accidentally slamming into a single wall spells disaster. That, or miscalculating a drift. Either way, it's time for a restart.    Drifting goes hand-in-hand with nitrous in the Ridge Racer universe. Using juice works the same way it did in Ridge Racer 6 on the Xbox 360. It comes in three phases, each of which fills up while drifting. Players can trigger each phase manually, so there's no need to use it all at once. And since it doesn't fill up while it's actually being used, there's a constant need to strategize when to drift and when to boost. After practice, players will rarely run out, since the quality of the drift determines how much nitrous is gained. But it's serious fun getting to that point. Once a driver can boost in and out of drifts, they've got it made.   Ridge Racer 7 has all the basic modes required of modern racers. The quickest way to jump in and start racing is Arcade Mode. Here, players just pick a car and track and head off to the start line. It has two basic options, single play and multi play. The latter lets two live players compete via split screen, though there's a definite loss in framerate and visual quality. Textures look muddy, for instance, and races lose the fluidity and grace of the single-player and online matches. It's definitely unfortunate, though it doesn't ruin the experience completely. And it's nice that the second player option remains, even though the emphasis has switched to global encounters through the network system.        In addition to Arcade, players also score Ridge State Grand Prix. It's the definitive centerpiece of the game and where most of the action happens. Entering RSGP triggers an intro movie that sets up the mood, not to mention the player's career as a global racer. The main screen paints a world map with the locations of different events and races. Before players can get started, though, they need to create a relationship with a manufacture by competing in a Manufacturer's Trial.   If successful, a manufacturer will let a driver race its cars and buy original parts. From here, drivers need to earn money and fame points by competing in individual events and Grand Prix races. The more races a player wins, the more money he or she earns, paving the way for high-profile races and serious fame points. Players can also get cozy with select manufacturers and suppliers by using their parts in races, earning Manufacturer Points. This helps in several ways, but for the most part it lets a driver score better equipment. In addition to Grand Prix races and Manufacturer trials, Ridge Racer 7 also has UFRA single events. These provide specific challenges, such as time trials or races under strict conditions, and provide drivers with credits to buy parts.    Car customization is new to the Ridge Racer universe. Players can hop into the Machine Connector, either through the main menu or within RSGP, to purchase and modify vehicles. The game offers a good number of options, including engine tune-up, tires & suspension, nitrous and plug-in units. Players can mess with visual upgrades, too, such as spoilers, wheels, decals and paint options. Each category has numerous items - enough to keep players busy for a long time. The developer claims Ridge Racer 7 has a possible 300,000-plus combinations, though it'd take serious time to really find out. Best of all, swapping parts actually makes a difference when racing, so it's a great incentive to win those pesky, yet high-reward courses. Every part matters later in the game, so plan on spending time (and money) making that one perfect ride. In the end, Customization adds a ton of depth to the game and it's a step in the right direction. Subsequent Ridge Racer titles would feel shallow without it.   The online component is every bit as large and important as the main RSGP mode. That is to say, the online experience permeates virtually every aspect of the Ridge Racer experience. From the moment players boot it up, they're online, able to view global stats on the right side of the screen and through a stock market-like ticker on the bottom of the screen. Statistics on this preliminary tracker include a player's global ranking, fame and OBP rankings, as well as total miles driven. Each driver gets their own Ridge State ID card, too, which works a lot like a gamer's Xbox Live profile. It lists everything from global rank and fame, to a player's location and special awards they've earned. These awards include things like ~Bounty Hunter~, ~Winning Streak~ and ~RSGP Champion.~ It serves to mention that it's all integrated very well. It really does feel like each driver is part of a living, self-contained world of high-stakes racing.    As far as actual modes, global racers can compete in Global Time Attack, as well as basic ranked matches with friends or anonymous drivers around the world. There's also the option to race cooperatively, which is by far the most enjoyable option. Players can organize nitrous, drifting and slipstreaming strategies via canned messages quickly and effectively. It's not the most advanced chat feature, but it's easy to use and works damn well. It's super rewarding to watch as teammates block rival drivers and slipstream effectively. In addition, developers have promised a slew of downloadable events, known as UFRA Special Events, that pit real drivers against each other. There's no way to test this feature, however, since no events exist at the time of this writing. Still, the available Rank Browser, online modes and overall connectivity throughout the entire Ridge Racer 7 experience is impressive.   While not a revolution, Ridge Racer 7 takes the long-running series forward. It keeps the larger-than-life race dynamic that fans have come to love and adds a rewarding customization option. An even bigger enhancement deals strictly with online functionality. Would-be drivers will feel like members of a global race community, complete with constantly updating race statistics and personal achievements. A nice selection of tracks, tunes and rides round out this very solid package.", "date": "Nov 14, 2006"}
