Sports Skydiving Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/08/go-sports-skydiving-review", "text": "While the PlayStation Network has seen drastic changes in the amount and quality of content that we see hit the service on a weekly basis, there are still times where things aren't so peachy. The Go! Sports franchise is the perfect example of this. Go! Sports Ski remains the worst game on the system, and its follow-up, Go! Sports Skydiving, isn't a whole lot better.   Firstly, let's talk about the similarities between the two games (besides their crappiness). Though the developers are different (Yuke's made Ski while Lightweight did Skydiving), they share the same front end wrapper. So the menu system, help screens, online stuff and all of those sorts of things are pretty much identical and carry the same issues. For instance, you can download the replays for some of the online high scores, but the files are saved with cryptic filenames, requiring that you hover over them to see what they are which generally makes it a pain to find what you want.   Likewise, the Online option for the Landing mode just means that your high score will be uploaded, making the Offline option pretty much useless unless you're shy. Even the manual has problems as it's simply a web page, but the window has a large border around it and the game's native 720p resolution isn't big enough to display it, meaning that you have to scroll around in each page to read - not just up and down, but left and right as well.    Presentation issues aside, what's important is the gameplay, and unfortunately that falls dead flat as well. Generally speaking, there are two main modes: Formation and Landing. Formation has you team up with three other jumpers (who can all be human players either locally or online) and switch between different stunt setups. It's basically a game of Simon Says, as a ghost image of your character will appear and it's simply your job to get into position and press R1 and/or L1 to grab onto folks around you. There's unfortunately no free-form mode, which would have been somewhat interesting.   Aside from this being boring since all you're doing is following cues, the controls and recognition of your placement are both quite touchy. When it's your job to grab onto someone else, you can be out of position slightly and still complete the move, but when the computer has to grab onto you, it sometimes won't until you're in just the right spot. Getting there can be an issue thanks to the game's almost total reliance on Sixaxis control.   Rocking the controller forward, backward, left and right will move your character around the formation, which works reasonably well for the most part. However, spinning your character by way of rotating the Sixaxis left and right is very unforgiving. Since the controller is based on motion and not placement, the game doesn't have a good sense of a zero point. So if you rotate the controller in one direction, your guy will sometimes move just a little and stop, but he'll sometimes just keep spinning. You'd think that moving it back in the other direction to its original orientation would stop the spin, but this can often just cause him to continue spin in the other direction. Getting him just right can be a real pain.   When you've dropped low enough, you just need to pull your chute. Unfortunately, the Formation mode doesn't require that you actually land your jumper. This is delegated to the Landing mode, which is where you can actually perform individual stunts. Like the movement in the Formation mode, stunts are performed by rotating the Sixaxis in different directions while holding down L1 and R1. There is some sort of rhyme and reason to what's happening here, but you can do fairly well by just rocking it in random directions for a while. When it's time to pull the chute, you just yank the controller upwards. And no, you cannot hit the ground in a splattering death, sadly. It's the very first thing we tried.   Simon Says go there. You win! Once you're going in for a landing, you simply rock the Sixaxis left or right to turn slightly, or pull back on the left and right analog sticks to make hard turns. Pulling them both back essentially applies the brakes. Once your chute is pulled, your descent becomes pretty slow and boring. You have a ways to go, and once you're in line with the landing spot (which is fast and easy to do), all you're doing is managing your speed for the next minute or two.   Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is its one unlockable mode, which we'll go ahead and spoil now (you shouldn't be playing this game anyway). There are two Licenses you can work through, one for Formation and one for Landing, each of which just gives you a handful of point or formation totals to complete before needing to pull the chute. Once you've gotten the S license for Landing, you unlock the Extreme mode. Our interest was immediately piqued. Will we now be allowed to pull the chute at the last second? Will we be able to jump from the stratosphere?   Nope, you just collect money as you're falling, which has no value outside of the individual run except for your placement on your own high score table. You can't even upload your scores from the Extreme mode online. Weak sauce.Go! Sports Skydiving is slightly better than Go! Sports Ski. 'Nuff said.", "date": "Feb 8, 2008"}
