TiQal is the latter and most definitely not intended for the hardcore audience. The gradual learning curve and bright Mayan theme are the sensible match to an entry level gamer but most will find the game has a ~been there, done that~ feeling to it.    If you've played Lumines and Tetris in the past (and if you haven't, you should), TiQal won't offer much you haven't seen before. The game follows a classic falling block formula. Oddly shaped blocks fall down and it's your job to rotate and situate them so as to clear away those on the ground before the whole stack reaches the top of the screen. Blocks will only clear when a group of four squares of a similar color combine to make a larger square, a la Lumines. Stack on some more of the same color before they clear and you can start to build up combos and chains for bonus points.     The extra ingredient TiQal adds to the pot is power-ups. Build up a chain meter and the game will release a power-up for you to grab, the bigger the chain the better the reward. The power-ups each do their own special thing but all invariably clear out a few blocks to and make things easier for you. My favorite is the Jaguar Strike, a power-up that clears every block of a certain color and rewards you with a nice big cat snarl.    With the basics under control, I set out on the TiQal's solo adventure, set in the balmy Yucatan. Many blocks must be dropped to do things like collect offerings and explore pyramids as the adventure unfolds through paragraphs of text. Each stage is passed when enough blocks are cleared and occasionally a bonus round gets tossed in to spice things up a bit. Along the way, new power-ups and block shapes are unlocked and historical facts about Mesoamerica are delivered. And I could not be beat. My block dropping skills were unstoppable through the first third of the game.   Several more hours passed. I still had not lost a life. My thoughts began to shift away from pride at being the greatest TiQal player ever to those associated with playing a game whose learning curve is way too flat. I understand that TiQal is made for casual gamers just looking to drop a few blocks, but there is such a thing as being too casual. Where's the challenge? If you've played any puzzle game in the past, you'll have to get through over half of the 120 stages in TiQal before the game starts to offer any tension. On the other hand, there might be something worth looking at if you're totally new to dropping blocks or videogames in general.   TiQal is quite encouraging and happy. But then, there is one other issue. The two games that TiQal mimics are both available on Xbox Live Arcade and are both better falling block options. TiQal has neither the style of Lumines nor the simplicity and classic nostalgia of Tetris. It's not much more than a ~me too~ game that feels miles behind its better known peers. It's not that TiQal is poor or boring, even if it is too easy for too long. There simply are better alternatives.   If you're up for the small challenge and Mayan theme, there's also some multiplayer to fall back on when you get tired of playing by yourself. Unfortunately, it's more of the same. The only multiplayer option, available locally and through Xbox Live, is a cooperative mode where two people work on the same board dropping pieces simultaneously. There's no adversarial head-to-head gameplay in TiQal.  TiQal is a fairly derivative falling block game, but it matches to the target casual audience fairly well. If youre looking for a laid back puzzler it might be worth your time to give TiQal a try. Hardcore puzzle gamers will likely find it takes too long to offer any challenge and should stick to the better alternatives on Xbox Live Arcade.", "date": "Mar 26, 2008"}
