Now one of handset gaming's hottest players is stepping the ring to offer its take on the grand sport and spectacle of boxing.  Can Sorrent continue its winning streak?  Features: 1st preson action Three rankings: Amateur, Pro, and Championship Different defensive strategies Utilizies Sorrent's Mobile Persona technology   You start off FOX Sports Boxing as a mere contender, hungry for the belt.  It's recommended to step into the ring in Amatuer mode first, as you'll want a few rounds of fairly painless punishment to acquaint yourself with the controls.  All of the boxing moves are programmed to numbers on the key pad.  For example, ~1~ will unleash a wicked hook, while ~5~ conjures a flurry of fast shots intended to stun your opponent.  Assigning punches to the number pad sounded iffy at first, but the layout is intuitive and easy to learn.  By the time you've reach the final round of the Amateur bouts, you'll know exactly what to do to serve up a delicious and devilish beatdown.  Move your way up the ranks - encountering some real pros along the way like John Ruiz and Mickey Ward - and you'll notice the action getting harder and faster.  But the real surprise is, the AI never cheats.  Never once do you feel like you were on the receiving end of a barrage of cheap shots and lucky blows.  The computer just monitors your moves and patterns, and learns from it.  If you constantly dart left and right, expect to swoop directed into a wicked hook.  It keeps you on your toes, just like a real boxer.  Between each match you'll be asked to select a defensive strategy.  Sometimes it's best to hang back and let the other sucka tired himself out, something it's best to go all Thing on him and declare ~clobberin' time.~  But the real ace is Sorrent's Mobile persona tech, which allows you to actually play against another human being.  Check your Sorrent Buddy List, and if one of your pals is online and ready to swallow a knuckle sandwich, it's easy to start up a match.  It's been long-prophesized that online, head-to-head play is the future of gaming, and it's good to see Sorrent taking the initiative to fulfill such a vision.  Visually, FOX Sports Boxing is impressive, especially in the handset field.  A great deal of go-go celly titles feature bleh sprites or static backgrounds painted with the world's most limited palette.  Not to gush, but FOX Sports Boxing does none of that.  Each boxer is 3-D rendered, and decently animated.  Every boxer looks different - none of that re-using models and just changing skin tones.  Between rounds, a comely ring girl will walk the squared circle.  And if you check the background - provided you're willing to take your eyes off the lug in front off you - you'll notice the swelling crowd surrounding the ring.  Excellente.  With so much packed into FOX Sports Boxing, great visuals, smart AI, you'd expect the audio to suffer.  After all, it's usually the first thing to go in a handset game. FOX Sports Boxing provides good, ambient ring noise, a clear bell, and pretty good punching sounds.  Sure, it doesn't sound exactly like glove-on-flesh, but it sure sounds a lot more realistic than the ~crink~ noise Sam Fisher's gun makes in Splinter Cell.FOX Sports Boxing does indeed float like a butterfly.  It stings like a bee.  It's also an absolute gas to play.  It's without hesitation that we say FOX Sports Boxing is one of the best handset games we've played since first picking up on 3G gaming.  The entire package is as rock-solid as Ali's abs - everything from the visuals to the controls, which are usually the Achilles' Heel of a celly game, is amazing.  This is indeed a must-download.", "date": "Jul 28, 2003"}
