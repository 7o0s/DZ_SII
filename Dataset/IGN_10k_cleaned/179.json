This year's run has to be the best Madden yet, and if I had to pick a football game to buy for the new millennium, Madden NFL 2000 may have to be the one to get.  Gameplay Wow. When compared to last year's Madden, the game alone just moves so much faster. Madden NFL 99's players were polygonal and looked great, but they moved so sluggish. But this year, Madden 2000 isn't hindered by slow on-field players, oh no, these suckers, although they look a little grainy, move quick, almost life-like. Seriously, the players are freakin' fast and that alone just makes the flow of the game go so much quicker -- there's never a dull moment, it's constant football.  Not much has changed with the play interface. The X button still does just about everything, and the plays, they're all similar to last year's version, and the year before that, and the year before that. But hey, there's a play editor for those that want to add a little spice to their play-books -- I've got some weird ones, not even the computer knows what to do against them.  Off the field, Madden NFL 2000 has tons of extras that you would expect to see in any football including multiple play modes such as Exhibition, Season, Franchise, Tournament, Practice, and my personal favorite, Situation. There's nothing better than to skip all the bull, and get right into the last play of the game. Just imagine, you just scored a touchdown, but you're still down by one, do you go for the extra point, or the two-point conversion for the win... ah! I have to go play that scenario -- I'll be back in one sec.   Madden NFL 2000 has loads of other play features that ups the value as well. Fantasy Draft options, customize your play-book, there's all sorts of extra goodies.   Graphics The graphics, hmm, although not the best we've seen, are way above adequate for any football game guru. Although Gameday looks better, I have to say that Madden NFL 2000 isn't too far behind. The stadiums alone are detailed to the max and players look and move just dandy.  Not to keep mentioning the on-field players, but that's where Tiburon really focused its energy, is in the player's look, speed and movement. It's totally cool, like the extra animations alone are sweet. Players can get completely racked with a shoulder, get picked up, by their feet, and dunked head first into the ground, and the jukes, oh, you can just see all the fat defensive linemen's ankles just cracking.   Speaking of fat linemen, that's another bonus -- I'll explain. Gameday has a clean look, but the players don't really vary in size. Madden NFL 2000, on the other hand, wide receivers look like wide receivers (skinny and agile), centers look like centers (big). The players may not look as crisp, but they do vary in size and speed, and although that may fall under the 'Gameplay' category. Still, size does matter and it when everyone on the field looks and moves differently, hey, that just adds even more realism to the game.  Sound Here's something that needs to be spruced up a bit, the sound. When doing a dive tackle, or when you smash into someone with your shoulder, the sound of the pads crashing together is great. You can't help but to flinch sometimes when one of your guys gets tackled. But other than that, the sound isn't that exciting. In fact, the crowd sounds like a blender underwater -- bluert ert ertschhhherrahhhaahha. And the Maddenisms, man, John just doesn't sound as happy as he used to be.  I don't know, there just needs to be something else going on back there. Maybe it's because I play a lot of college football games, who knows. Other than that, though, it's a solid game and sound should only play a small role in the overall Madden experience.  Overall It seems like I say this every year, but this has to be the best Madden game, yet. Madden NFL 2000 has tons of great features, the game looks and moves a whole lot better than last year's version, it's a smart purchase for those who just want a good, complete football game. I just wish the sound was a little better. Mr. Madden? Get some sleep before you do the voiceovers, you just sound so unenthused.
