Atari's heart is in the right place: lose the clutter and offer up four appealing, successful Hasbro games in a single package that puts the Nintendo DS functions to use. And while the horribly titled Monopoly - Boggle - Yahtzee - Battleship offers almost exactly what the physical board games do, the actual effort the development team put into the presentation is a little lackluster and unenthusiastic. If you can accept the sloppiness of the development, this compilation isn't half bad in either single or multiplayer challenges.   Atari quietly launched Monopoly - Boggle - Yahtzee - Battleship for the DS just a couple of days before Christmas. ~Quietly~ is the key phrase here, an odd action considering how much this product tailors to the ~stocking stuffer~ mentality. Four immediately recognizable names on one box, for less than the price if you actually went to Toys 'r Us and bought the games separately? That's money in the bank right there. And touch screen control? That's almost like playing the real thing!   For these four different games, Atari went with Sensory Sweep for their development. This studio hasn't exactly made a huge splash on the Nintendo DS platform, as the company has been responsible for some of the worst titles on the handheld, namely Marvel Nemesis and  Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The team did work on the surprisingly solid World Championship Poker: Deluxe Series last year, which indicates that the studio may be more comfortable with game designs that don't have a whole lot of expectations.    Boggle, a Scrabble-inspired dice game, makes a whole lot of sense on the Nintendo DS. Shake the dice up in the canister, lay the playfield out on the touch screen and start spelling out words with the stylus. The developers do a decent enough job recreating the game on the handheld system, and drawing out the words as they're laid out in the grid makes everything flow intuitively. The in-cartridge dictionary recognizes many words, but it missed a few common ones. In multiplayer mode, any unrecognized word will be sent over to the other player for approval, but this approval interface is enormously confusing and inconsistent since it's never clear if you're approving your own words or the other player's. There's a solid assortment of variations on the main Boggle theme to strengthen the single player experience.   Battleship is still as classic as the grid game has ever been: lay out five different ships on a pegboard ocean, and each player takes turns guessing the coordinates of where the opponents' ships are located. It works pretty well on the Nintendo DS because players simply tap on the coordinate where they want to blast the enemy. The DS rendition lacks some of the updated rules, like the Speed Play that allows players to fire a shot for each ship they still have on the playing field. But players can customize their match with a variety of themes, from the classic boardgame ships to UFOs to marine life. The gameplay's a little on the slow side since each player has to wait for the opposing person's animations to play out before moving onto the next turn.   Yahtzee is also a hard game to screw up, and the Nintendo DS version works, albeit just a bit clunkier than the rest of the batch due to sloppier touch screen implementation. Roll the dice three times in a turn, and try to fill up the card with as many points as you can with set outcomes. Poker hands, like straights, three of a kind, four of a kind, and full houses net big points, as does the coveted Yahtzee, a five of a kind roll. The DS version of Yahtzee, like its rendition of Battleship, offers a variety of themes, including the classic boardgame style, all the way to a hamster cage (spinning the dice off the wheel) and a graveyard where the dice pop out of a tomb. The touch screen is a little less sensitive in places, making it hard to select dice when they land in set spaces, and the fact that players have to use the L and R to scroll the game card to slot a set hand makes things a lot clumsier than it should be.   And finally, we have Monopoly, possibly the most ambitious game in the pack due to its much more in depth rules and regulations. It's a tough game to get right in a virtual version due to all the specifics that are needed to make the game work, but as a whole the game plays, at the bare minimum, like it should. The developers jazz things up with goofy little animations, like a top hat that's propelled around by a bunny inside. Some things work oddly, though, like the dice visuals that seem to float off the board instead of roll. Other elements operate a bit more awkwardly than they should: deals between players just sort of happen uneventfully and in a strange and confusing interface. But much of the standard ruleset is here, and universally used ~house rules,~ like the Free Parking bonus, can be flagged on and off.   The ~Single Cartridge Multiplayer~ note on the back of the box is a little misleading; Boggle and Battleship can be played with a single cartridge, which is greateven if the linked, cartridge-free systems lack any in-game sound effects, and the system has to annoyingly power down after EVERY SINGLE GAME. But Monopoly and Yahtzee both require multiple cartridges for up to four player gaming. We can sort of understand Monopoly needing it due to its more complex mechanics and visuals. But Yahtzee? Come on.It's clear that this pack was developed on a strict budget with a ~bare minimum~ mentality. Much of the game is operational and fun, but it's hard to ignore that the package could have used another few weeks to iron out the little quirks. The missing single cartridge multiplayer modes in Yahtzee and Monopoly are more than just a little disappointing, and probably hurt the experience more than the goofy glitches and clunky interfaces do. But, on the plus side, Atari's willingness to put Monopoly, Boggle, Yahtzee, and Battleship on the DS means we're one step closer to a real dream: full-fledged, wireless, touch-screen, online Scrabble. Get on it, Atari. And put a budget behind it.", "date": "Jan 12, 2006"}
