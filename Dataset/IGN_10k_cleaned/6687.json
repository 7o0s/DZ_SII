But it was probably clear from the get-go that Invasion From Beyond would be a tongue-in-cheek arcade shooter not meant to blow away the techie crowd, and not entirely unique in its origins.   The irony of GT Interactive's and King of the Jungle's nice little shoot-'em-up is that it's an extremely good-looking game with great sound effects and a fantastic retro sensibility. It really does look like one of the better games on PlayStation.   Invasion from Beyond is an arcade shooter that appears to take the gameplay from Defender into the third dimension. You must defend Earth from a horde of flying tyrannical saucers large enough in quantity to wipe out civilization as we know it. But simple killing isn't going to do it. In your many mission objectives, you must save people, transport them, kill off saucers, and follow the many instructions that appear in the midst of play.   Luckily, the game is loaded with funky weapons and 1950's-style gadgets that'll make kicking alien butt a little easier. You start with only two weapons, and must earn them as you progress. There are about 20 or so that can be earned. Players will find that the cute-but-effective Suck-o-matic will help them move people and things to complete missions as well. Also along your way, you'll need to pick up scientists and strange alien gadgets that will help you build special weapons and other defenses to tackle the big ships and tougher obstacles.   As we said, Invasion From Beyond is a great looking game. Nearly everything in it is polygonal and texture-mapped, and the design is perfectly conceived and executed -- right out of a 1950's B sci-fi movie. (Or, for you younger sorts, Mars Attacks). Peaceful little towns with cartoonish characters pepper the area, and the enemies really do look like corny flying saucers.   You can choose digital or analog control. Both are benefited with strafing techniques and primary and secondary weapon control. Embarrassing though it may sound, my biggest gripe with Mars Attacks, whoops! I mean, Invasion From Beyond is that it's difficult to control. With controls that aren't very sharp, but require precision and timing under duress, Invasion becomes frustrating quickly. Which is strange, because everything about it seems simplistic and arcade-oriented. There are loads of funny little situations and missions and it appears easy enough at first, but when you're being attacked by a first wave of 50 flying saucers with the knowledge of 50 more coming down in 30 seconds, the challenge becomes maddening. It wouldn't be so bad, except for the loose aiming controls, which move in full 3D. While this is an excellent concept in theory, maneuvering through the swarms and managing missions isn't a pretty picture, and it's not as fun as it looks. I love a challenge, but a game should still remain fun, too. One of the best qualities of the game is the music, which deserves special mention. It sounds like Danny Elfman did the score perfectly from Mars Attacks. It's spooky, goofy, and clear as a bell -- perfect for the game. All in all, Invasion From Beyond is a good, little game. But nothing more.", "date": "Jan 16, 1999"}
