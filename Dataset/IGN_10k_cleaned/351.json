It's perfect for players who are bored with traditional racing games and for racing fanatics who are looking for something original. While Lego Racers dishes out the goods in terms of customization and replay features, the game's simplistic design and lacking multiplayer mode may leave some Lego maniacs dissatisfied.   Features  24 themed tracks, divided into 6 circuits 12 Lego car sets available for constructing drivers and cars Timed race mode with the ability to race your own ghost Two-player head-to-head race mode Power weapons with the ability to upgrade Rumble Pak compatible   Gameplay Rocket Racer, the greatest racing champion in all of Legoland, has brought together the best racers for the ultimate competition. The six most skilled drivers -- Captain Redbeard, King Kahuka, Basil the Bat Lord, Johnny Thunder, Baron von Barron, and Gypsy Moth -- each host their own circuit race. There are four racing modes: circuit race, single race, versus race, and time race.  The circuit race is Lego Racers' main attraction. Each circuit is made up of four different races on tracks with either a space, adventurer, castle, or pirate theme. Racers are awarded points based on how they finish in the race:10 points for first, 20 for second, 10 for third, three for fourth, two for fifth, and one for sixth. You need at least 10 points after the first race to advance to the second race in a circuit, 20 points total to advance to the third race, and 30 points total to advance to the final race of the circuit. So basically, you need to get into the top three all the time to continue racing. And if you're in the top three at the end of the circuit, you unlock the next race circuit. The frustrating part about the game is that you can't retry a race in the middle of a circuit. For example, if you place in the top three in the first two races, but get fifth place in the third race, you can't just race through the third race again. You have to start the entire circuit over. But the racing is so much fun, this technicality can be overlooked.   To be the overall winner of the particular circuit, you must have the most points after all four races. This entails beating the host of the circuit who gets first in each race if you don't. So do the math after each race and figure out what place you need to tie or stay ahead of the circuit's host. Once you achieve first place in a particular circuit, you not only unlock the next circuit, but you also unlock, for your building pleasure, the Lego set associated with the host. The prize for outwitting Captain Redbeard is the pirate Lego set, which includes his car and comes complete with treasure chests and parrots for your vehicle and a wooden leg for your driver. The final circuit is hosted by Rocket Racer himself. It contains only one race, and it's a tough one.    One major element missing from Lego Racers is multi-player action in the circuit race. There's nothing better than demolishing your friends in a race and claiming first place. The game has a two-player versus mode but it's not the same.  Much like Mario Kart, you can pick up different power weapons, represented by red, yellow, green, and blue bricks. These are essential to beating, if not keeping up with, the other racers. The best part is upgrading the basic power items: the cannon ball, the oil slick, the temporary shield, and the turbo boost. Picking up white bricks will bring whatever weapon you possess, or will possess, up a notch.  (You can collect white bricks even if you don't hold a weapon.) For example, a cannon ball can be turned into a grappling hook, which can be turned into a lightening wand, which can be turned into three guided rockets. The oil slick can ultimately be turned into a mummy's curse, which causes another racer's car to go crazy. The grand daddy of them all is the turbo boost. After getting the maximum of three white bricks, you get the warp turbo boost, which warps you ahead of the competition without having to maneuver through the course at a high speed. Some courses have a plethora of green turbo boost bricks and the white power up bricks while others are lacking. In these particular tracks, you'll have to master the other weapons and shortcuts. The warp turbo boost, however, is an absolute must to beat Rocket Racer. Beware of other weapon-yielding racers. If they hit you with a weapon while you're saving up your white power up bricks, you'll lose a brick and your weapon will be downgraded. Also look out for spaceships, ghosts, or other obstacles that try to thwart you along the way.  A racing game wouldn't be any fun if it didn't have any shortcuts. The shortcuts in Lego Racers vary in difficulty and simply require quick thinking. You may just need to cut across a valley or slip into a barely hidden tunnel. Or you may need a cannonball to blast a wall or a pile of barrels. Others call for more. For example, one shortcut requires you to quickly align your car with a crocodile's body so that you can accelerate across the length of its back and be vaulted onto the hidden path.  But you can only do this when its mouth is open.  You can power slide and super slide your way to victory, making sharp turns at high speeds. Both require some practice -- a little less for the power slide.  You definitely need to learn the power slide to grab bricks and stay on the track but you can get away with not learning the super slide. The power slide merely involves the R and A buttons whereas the super slide requires the R, B, and A buttons. But if you are one with your controller and can fiddle with it in a split-second, then more power to ya. Even if you master both, it's almost impossible not to hit any walls or other obstacles along the way so prepare for a bumpy ride. If you screw up, which is inevitable if you get caught in a corner or end up turned the wrong way, it's difficult to catch up to the other racers that have probably whizzed right by you. There aren't any lightening bolts or invincibility stars to save you. But if you've warped yourself a sizeable lead, playing it safe will guarantee you the win.  The single race mode allows you to play a particular race from any of the circuits you have unlocked. This mode is useful for practicing on that one race that's keeping you from that overall first place finish. The versus mode pits you against another human player in any of the races you've unlocked. In the time race mode, you race against the ghost car of Veronica Voltage, Rocket Racer's friend. Once you beat her on every track, surprise, you win the pieces to her powerful racing car. You can also race against your own ghost when you repeat a track and hone your racing skills.  Handling is surprisingly tight. Cars corner very easily and the control setup, inspired by Mario Kart before it, is as intuitive as ever. Track layouts, admittedly simplistic and often not very difficult, are still well designed and a lot of fun to race through. Perhaps our biggest complaint with Lego Racers is, again, with its multiplayer mode, which not only fails to deliver the goods in head-to-head competition, but completely lacks any four-player support.   Customization Before you've been able to unlock any of the circuits, you are presented with four car sets: basic bricks, race bricks, space bricks, and castle bricks. Even with these four sets, you can let your imagination go wild. You get to choose the driver's hat or hair, the yellow headpiece (or a white skull head), the body, and the legs. The more circuits you unlock, the more pieces become available. If you want to fool with creating your own driver, you can choose the Mix options and the computer will build a driver for you. But before you can construct a car, you must create a driver's license. Enter a cool name for your driver and then choose a driver's license photo from a variety of snapshots. Yes, my friends, they have it all-the angry photo, the eyes-closed photo, and the deer-caught-in-headlights photo. Now, you're ready to build a car.   Don't worry, you don't have to know anything about placement of engines and tires. All you need to know is how Lego pieces fit together. Even if you don't have that knowledge, the computer guides you in your building, letting you know where you can or can't put a brick. You start out by choosing your chassis from the available car sets. They each have their own qualities. The Space chassis has big tires while the Castle chassis is a big wagon. Then it's up to you to piece your car together, combining different Lego bricks from each of the car sets. There are height and width restrictions so you can't build it extra-high or extra-wide. And there are a couple of things you need to think about when you're constructing weight and balance. You'll want to stick to having a balanced car, which means don't put a lot of bricks on one side of the car. This will keep you from veering off to one side. The weight of the car depends on the chassis and the number of bricks you put on it. Heavier cars go faster and are easier to steer, but take a longer time to accelerate. Lighter cars don't go as fast and don't turn as easily, but accelerate more quickly. In MK terminology, think Donkey Kong or Wario versus Yoshi or Princess. Also remember that certain types of cars will race better than other types on a particular track. As in building a driver, you also have the option of having the computer build your car; just click on the Quick Build option and viola, a car. After you've constructed the greatest Lego vehicle there ever was you can test-drive it in the test arena which houses a concrete track and an off-road track.  Graphics While much of the action takes place in Lego themed environments, the environments hardly reflect this. A few scarce background objects appear to be constructed of Legos, but otherwise High Voltage Software has created the 3D courses from the ground up. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, as tracks are still visually appealing. A combination of bright colors and simplistic terrain offer an overall appearance that falls somewhere between the levels found in Mario Kart 64 and those seen in Diddy Kong Racing.  The framerate, even with all racers on screen at once, is consistent, if not entirely smooth. Particle effects are primitive, but get the job done.  Sound Most of what you hear while racing is your car sliding, skidding, and accelerating along the track. Each track has its own theme music but you can hardly hear it over the car noises. Each weapon makes a clear and distinct sound as it's deployed. There are miscellaneous sounds in each track that remind you of what themeland you're in. Rockets roar above and lava pits gurgle in the space tracks while obelisks crumble in the adventurer tracks. The music accompanying the menu and customizing screens is peppy and cartoon-like. It may get annoying if frustration is overwhelming you. If you love MK, and I know you do, then you'll want to sample what Lego Racers has to offer. Lego continues to promote the imagination and creativity with its Lego Racers unique building options.  If your mom never let you have all of those different Lego sets, Lego Racers puts them right at your fingertips. The weapons and shortcuts spice up the racing on the somewhat simple tracks. The game's visuals, not overwhelming, are up to par with previous Nintendo efforts and the framerate is almost always dependable. My biggest gripe lies in the game's lacking multiplayer support -- only two-player versus -- especially when the main competition is Mario Kart, one of the best multiplayer games for the console. Still, Lego Racers comes highly recommended for younger players and Kart racing fans.", "date": "Oct 27, 1999"}
