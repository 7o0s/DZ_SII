{"name": "Irritating Maze", "name_review": "Irritating Maze", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/02/10/irritating-maze", "text": "The title Irritating Maze will likely apply to half of the gamers that download this simple, but occasionally addictive, action-puzzle game. Some will be enthralled by the prospect of pushing a metal stick through a gadget-filled labyrinth, taking special care not to touch any of the walls. The other half will grow listless and be irritated they spent their money on it.   I found myself in the first category, but then again, I'm a fan of games like this. I still have a copy of Irritating Stick for the PSone, which is essentially the same thing. You must guide a stick (but from your angle, it looks like a dot) through increasingly more complicated mazes while time runs out. The first few mazes are fairly simple, but this is to both get you used to the control nuances -- as well as lull you into a false sense of security. Before long, the mazes are full of spinning rotors and moving walls that must be avoided.   The mazes get bigger, too, so it is with great mercy that the developers installed checkpoints that freeze the clock and let you rest for a second or two before getting back out into the maze. Should you accidentally touch a wall, you'll be transported back to the checkpoint, which should help quell any, ahem, irritation. The mazes are incredibly busy, with bright, colorful backgrounds that can mislead you. What looks like a wall is just part of the backdrop -- and what looks like something behind the play field is really an obstacle.   The controls are not exactly smooth, especially if you use the d-pad. The number keys make it a lot easier to move in all eight directions and deftly avoid obstacles.  Irritating Maze is a love-it-or-leave-it affair. I handed this one off to a friend who thought it was boring and stupid. I thought it was a decent alternative to the more traditional puzzle games you find on mobile, like Tetris and Bust-a-Move clones. If you like the old board game Operation, Etch-a-Sketch, and those wooden labyrinths -- Irritating Maze might be right up yer proverbial alley.", "date": "Feb 10, 2006"}
