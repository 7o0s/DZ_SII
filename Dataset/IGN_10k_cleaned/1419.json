My favorite part is when other people get hurt.  I, myself, have a soft spot for mindless mayhem.  Life in the 21st century may not offer gladiators or beheadings in the town square, but I get by. Thanks to network television, the movies, and Midway, there are dozens of kinds of violence, none better than any other.  You've got films with Jet Li, first-person shooters, bumper cars, paintball, pro wrestling.. and then there's World Destruction League:  Thunder Tanks, the game that gives pointless destruction a bad name.  Leave it to 3DO, makers of the Army Men games, to spoil the mood.  Gameplay Lordy, lordy, what we have here is a failure to entertain.  According to IGN64.com, Battle Tanx was a fine example of a game.  Usually, what works for Nintendo doesn't shake it on Sony's side.  It's pretty obvious that this was modeled off of Battle Tanx.  After all, you're in tanks and you battle.  The major difference between this and that is, World Destruction League just isn't any fun.  Yes, you're equipped with some huge artillery that's packed tightly in one mobile metal machine.  Yes, you can destroy just about everything and anything you see.  So where's my side of fun?  In the future, all is bleak.  The year 2062, apparently, has only one TV network.  What?  No more The Price is Right?  No more Daily Show?  It's a good thing I'll be dead by then.  Instead, we get to watch World Destruction League, the only show that has tanks shooting at eachother.  This is where you come in.  You, being the typical rookie, have to make your way up through the stages, blasting other tanks to rubble whenver they appear.  When you finally make it through every level, you're awarded the title of Champion of the League.  What an honor to behold.  The tournament mode is broken up into three different kinds of stages.  In the first kind, your objective is to destroy any major opponents.  Simple enough.  In the second kind, your objective is to capture flags and take them back to your goal.  This kind is actually split up into two parts.  In one, flags randomly appear on the battlefield.  Enemy tanks swarm the area and fight to collect them before you do.  If you can take a certain number of flags back to your base before they can, you pass the level.  The other flag-collecting stage only requires you to find the other enemy bases on the field and steal their flags.  The third type of level is pretty straight-forward.  To pass, all you must do is find the exit.  Along the way, you can pick up bonuses like health and weapons.  The weapons you find are your standard-issue stuff:  guided missiles, plasma bolts, laser cannons, mine layers, etc.  There are also radars, nukes, starts, ammunition, and double secrets.  Double secrets are hard to find, but give you a surprise power-up that lasts until the end of the level.  I found that I prefered to just use my basic weapon throughout the game.  It might not have been able to heat-seek or whatnot, but it did what I wanted.  In each stage, there are dozens of buildings, cars, barrels, and other obstacles.  The point to their existence is that you can blow them up.  Often, though, blowing up a barrel or car results in taking damage, if you're too close.  What's really unbelievable is that you can destroy complete two-story buildings with only a couple of shots.  If that's not sirreal, Salvidore Dali must be spinning in his grave.  The two parts that bugs me most about World Destruction League are its control and its terrible framerate.  Both of these have a serious effect on gameplay, and wound it mortally.  Moving your tank is a big chore, especially when you're in a tight situation and accidentally backed up into a wall.  The framerate smothers the gaping injury with salt.  The graphics aren't complex and there is never too much on the screen at once.  The only excuse I can see for this problem is that the creators rushed development and ignored it altogether.    At least the game's got a few levels that are specific for two-player gaming.  Do they work well?  Nope.  You've got a deathmatch mode, a family mode, a capture the flag mode, and a frenzy mode.  Capture the flag and frenzy modes are derived from the forementioned styles of play in the tournament.  Deathmatch and family are both designed to let players go at it.  Family is basically the same as deathmatch, except it's made to let less-experienced players have a better shot against pros.  The gameplay in each of these is still marred by bad control and sluggish framerates.  In total, there are a dozen tanks and ten players to choose from.  Each tank has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as special abilities.  Some tanks can strafe from side to side, which is useful to avoid enemies' gunfire.  I've got a few problems with this game overall.  For one, it's not fun to play.  Usually, I give a big two thumbs up to pointless violence.  It's fun to blow crap up.  Thunder Tanks just doesn't have any finesse.  Another problem I have is that it's boring and repetitive.  Each stage follows the same pattern, and its levels are predictable.  I've already complained about the framerate and control, so I'll let that sit.  Graphics The graphics are surprisingly bland and boring with such a low framerate.  I'd expect nice textures and smooth polygons, but instead I get gritty, pathetic visuals.  What's the deal?  This looks like a game that should have come out three years ago.  The explosions are terrible, the blasts are hideous, and the textures are morbidly ugly.  Even the folks behind the full-motion video couldn't pull that off well.  The few cutscenes are boring and unimpressive.  At least they're short.  Sound Ever heard a banshee shriek or Al Gore talk for more than ten minutes at one time?  Imagine the harmonious noises of both of those combined, and then imagine their essence packed into one video game.  This is exactly how Thunder Tanks sounds.  The music is uninspired.  I've heard better noises coming out of a buffalo's butt.  The sound effects make me cringe in disgust.  I figure that some kind of simian must be the talentless force behind its creation.  The voice acting similarly makes animal flatulence seem aurally appealing. C'mon, guys.  If you can score an 8.2 on a Battle Tanx game, the least you can do is score a 5.0 here.  Yes, 3DO, I'm talking to you.  As for the rest of the world, don't think twice about buying this.  Turn away and never look back.  For all the low points World Destruction League:  Thunder Tanks has, it sure doesn't have many high ones (if any).  I'd have to think long and hard before admitting that this game is somewhat fun.  I'd probably have to be brainwashed ala Clockwork Orange, too.", "date": "Nov 1, 2000"}
