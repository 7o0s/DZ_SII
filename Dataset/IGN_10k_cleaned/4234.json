And when you're a game design that's pretty close to the same deal as that game, that's not a great place to be in. But let it be said that there's nothing terrible about Onimushia Tactics, as it's a fun, if somewhat straightforward tactical RPG strategy game. But when compared to games like FFTA and Tactics Ogre, this game falls just a little flat with a much more ~vanilla~ design that does nothing to establish itself beyond what's already been done. Features More than 20 party members More than 20 missions Cartridge save (two slots)  There's something about the ~Tactical RPG~ genre that Japanese developers feel make a perfect home on the Game Boy Advance, and Capcom takes a crack at it with Onimusha Tactics. The game, set within the established Onimusha universe, follows Onimaru, a warrior on a quest to defeat the evil Genma army, and ultimately, the general Nobunaga. These bad guys are just causing death and destruction everywhere they go, and Onimaru will not only need to sharpen his weapon handling skills, he'll also need to recruit help from villagers and other warriors along the way.  The game definitely doesn't stray from the theme of the Tactical RPG genre; in fact, it's almost a watered down design that keeps the strategy element to a minimum. Players can set a team of ten characters (any more and they'll have to say ~see ya~ to one of them when a new guy shows up), and at the beginning of each mission it's up to the player to choose the allotted amount from their roster and place them in combat. There are characters that wield swords, staffs, bows...each with their own attack ranges. Players will have to take into account the terrain height into their attack pattern; the isometric view is really the best view for this sort of thing and the reason why most tactical games adopt this perspective.  All characters earn experience points after using their abilities, which makes levelling them up easier since they don't have to kill an enemy to earn points. Characters also feature special skill abilities that are more powerful and capable than a weapon strike, but these characters both have to earn them, and must have the skill points necessary to pull them off. Some of them allow for powerful magic attacks, while others give party members extra attack or defense abilities; some, not surprisingly, give health to whoever needs it. There isn't much in the way of originality in Onimusha Tactics, but it at least sticks to the formula well. Onimusha Tactics story is interesting enough to keep playing to the end, but don't expect much of a challenge along the way. It's almost impossible to screw-up royally in this game since the strategic element's kept to its basic formula; players don't need to worry about which direction their crew's facing after an attack like in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, for example, nor do they have to worry about the members of the party dying since they'll be ready to go in the next round...unless, of course, a mission takes a particularly long time, and that lost life will screw up whatever advanced strategy you had laid out. And if there's a mission that has a ~surprise element~ in it (like a continuously resurrecting ~boss~ character thanks to a partner elsewhere on the map), it's easy to adjust the plan of attack for the next try. Most missions can be completed in the first attempt, so don't expect a whole lot of frustrated resets during a mission.  The game design is just incredibly basic which becomes more obvious when you put it side by side with other games already released on the system. The game looks good and plays all right, but there's nothing here that will make players go, ~Oh, wow...cool!~ It's just a run of the mill strategy game in a fantasy setting; even the collection element of Genma stones to create new weapons isn't all that special. Its storyline is involved enough for folks that like that kind of thing, but go with games like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Fire Emblem, or even Tactics Ogre for a better and more interesting challenge.", "date": "Nov 20, 2003"}
