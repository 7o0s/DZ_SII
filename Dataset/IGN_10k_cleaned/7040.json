{"name": "Bomberman Kart", "name_review": "Bomberman Kart", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/30/bomberman-kart", "text": "Hudson is diving into its ample back catalog to drive its mobile pursuits, such as cell editions of Military Madness and Super Adventure Island. Bomberman has appeared on handsets before, but Bomberman Kart takes the mascot out of his traditional fire-filled maze environment and drops him behind the steering wheel in a pint-sized racing tournament. Kart racing has been tackled before on mobile with the likes of Popeye, Spongebob Squarepants, and Crash Bandicoot, and Bomberman fits right in the middle of pack -- it's not an exemplary play, but it's not a disappointment either.   Bomberman Kart follows many of the genre's established formulas: day-glo graphics, tracks fill of boosts and power-ups, and rubberband AI that keeps the race interesting right up to the last minute. You can select from a small army of racers at the beginning, each with different stats like acceleration, handling, and nitrous recovery. That last stat is one of the most important in the game, as nitro is a big part of your winning strategy. Each racer has a nitrous supply at the get-go, and the faster you can earn back spend turbo power, the easier it is to break through the pack. However, since many of the turns can be a little perilous, you also need to keep handling in mind, because spinning out is the best way go to go from first to last.   In addition to several racers, you also must choose from three different karts, each with their own stats, such as speed, nitrous, durability, and grip. Grip is a key consideration, as you'll be hugging a lot of turns in later tracks during the game's GP Tournament mode. Speed, however, is a good skill to have when plowing through Time Attack, trying to best your own lap times.   Hudson has crafted six tracks, each laden with an ample supply of power-ups, like land mines, missiles, and instant nitrous refills. Capturing these power-ups is imperative to success, but the other racers are quite adept at using them themselves. Getting a missile right up the ol' tailpipe is not a rare event in Bomberman Kart.   With five other racers jockeying for power-ups at all times, the game becomes a balancing act between negotiating turns and collecting/using power-ups. Sometimes, the game gets a little to manic for its own good. Mobile controls are already pretty limited, and kart racing with such a beefy pack full of missiles and mines normally requires a little more precision. Tapping the thumbpad as furiously as you can still results in some unintended mistakes, especially when coming into a corner quickly as nitrous wears off.    Bomberman Kart is certainly an attractive title. I tested it on an LG VX7000. The colors pop off the screen. The ~speed effect~ when you hit the nitrous is a nice touch. The sprites are drawn well enough that even when the screen gets cluttered with karts and power-ups, you can still follow what's happening with your eyes, even if you can't with your thumbs. The game has a little jingle that goes with the racing that's harmless enough.  Bomberman Kart is a fine entry in the kart racer genre for mobile if not a little on the unspectacular side. When things get hairy, the controls let you down from time to time. The overall package itself, though, is full of good content from plentiful power-ups to a nice selection of tracks with attractive backdrops. I recommend it with some reservation to casual mobile gamers, but kart racing fans that enjoy Crash Tag Team will enjoy what's going on here.", "date": "Jun 30, 2006"}
