Sure, as far as 2D fighters go, it's a quality series, but I'll take anime-style Street Fighter characters over stiff, video-captured, spandex-clad biker chicks any day. Sometimes I wonder if it's the gore that really made this series so popular.   OK, enough preaching. MK3 is an arcade-perfect translation, and is a welcome addition to any Mortal Kombat fan's collection. However, as far as MK goes, it kind of disappoints. When MK2 was released, the improvements made over the original were so vast, you couldn't help notice the difference. MK3, however, adds little to the series. Sure, there are a couple of new characters, a run feature, and a new combo system, but is it enough? Here's where opinion will split: die-hard fans will love it, others will wonder what all the fuss is about. I'm sure you've already made your decision. Plus, the PSX version has some serious glitches, like the infamous ~morph-pause.~ Ugh. Unless you're a serious MK freak, save this one for the arcades.  -- Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
