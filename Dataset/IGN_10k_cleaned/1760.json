Two new games from the small studio are now available, this driving game Championship Rally and a space shooter Remnant. Neither will put the system back into circulation by stunning gamers with gotta-have-it gameplay, but for Lynx gamers who are looking for a reason to drag their systems out of the closet, Championship Rally attempts to give them the race they're looking for.  Features  Rally racing gameplay with muscle in the power slides Seven tracks, including locked tracks available only to proven players Two-player ComLynx support Only for the Atari Lynx   While the occasional racing streets don't fit in with a Rally game, the control's slippery Power Slides still point to this as a rally game. You don't turn on your front wheels in this game -- instead, you kick out the back end and ease along corners with control all in the accelerator instead of the steering. This puts Championship Rally in a curious position -- the gameplay turns are fun for a rally game, but even at low speeds, the cars kick out instead of turning properly, and when there are tight corners and U-Turns, players might as well bump through than plan a turn at lower speeds. It's enjoyable gameplay when it's moving, but players will have to memorize the tracks, because there's no way to win on instinct.  And that's the main trouble with Championship Rally -- it's only playable through memorization, and yet there's so few tracks (and so little variety in each track) that it quickly loses its interest. The AI always provides a good challenge, but not enough to sustain players for long. A few tracks are littered with speed bursts and burrs, but others are barren and simple.  It's too bad, because the short ride has a few thrills. The cars' handling can be tweaked for speed and damage, and the difference becomes pretty great. The brake doesn't function like a true break should, especially for a rally game, but the speed with tweaked Acceleration and Top Speed runs well enough for gamers to just trust their driving and handling of the accelerator peddle. Pump it in straight-aways, then let it off and coast a turn before greasing back on out of the turn. Once you get used to it, the extra-wide sliding turns are fun... while you're winning.    It doesn't make sense why this game was finalized in this state. Nobody was demanding its release, so Songbird could have taken its time and finalized the tracks with lots more courses (variations on the existing graphic sets wouldn't have been a crime), and the control could have been tightened. And, more than anything else, the game could have used more than two players on ComLynx -- that's the only reason I bought my Lynx, and multiplayer is the most enjoyable feature of any Lynx game for me. Championship Rally still steers hard and fast, but without a more involving multiplayer game, it won't supplant Checkered Flag as my racer of choice. As a top-down racer, it can't compete graphically with Super Off-Road, but the control is much less problematic, so if that game disappointed you, this simple but speedy offering may fare better. Still, the driving game is tough to get used to, and the track selection is woefully short -- if there were a Track Design feature where gamers could trade tracks by password, it would have had kitsch appeal for dedicated Lynx-ers. But it's not to be here, so this game finishes, but finishes on a rough final lap.", "date": "Feb 2, 2001"}
