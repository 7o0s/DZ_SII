It's one of the most popular card games ever. We're talking about solitaire, the single-player card game that has been entertaining Hoyleheads for years. But when Atlas Mobile talks about solitaire, it's really talking about winning free stuff. Introducing, Atlas Solitaire For Prizes!    Features:    Solvable decks  Head-to-head tournaments  Progressive tournaments  Practice Mode    Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! is one of Atlas Mobile's prize-winning tournament games, where gamers sit down to a 52-card deck and try to bust out a solution in record time. If you know how to play solitaire already, you're ready for online play -- but Atlas Mobile included a nice practice game for beginners or people that need to refresh their skills at the loneliest card game ever created.    The neatest thing about this game, other than the whole free stuff angle, is that every deck is solvable. Using some super-secret tech, Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! only deal out decks that can be completed -- which certainly alleviates the frustration of playing for twenty minutes before you realized you were screwed from the get-go.    Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! is a race with two goals: the highest score and the quickest completion times. You're not ranked on your time, but you do receive extra points for finishing quickly. You are awarded specific point values for adding the card to suit piles. An ace nabs you 5,000 points. A face card is worth 500.    You can lose points, too. Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! deducts 1,000 points once you cycle through the deck more than three times. It also deducts 1,000 points if you have to move cards back from a suit pile. Make every move count, bubba.    Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! has a clock running in the corner, keeping the heat on. Your score is in the upper-left, so you can watch it grow as you brilliantly move the cards around the screen. The cards themselves are clearly displayed -- not a visual powerhouse, but considering the size of the display, Atlas Mobile did a good job to make sure you could instantly and easily ID each card's value and suit.Unlike Tetris, solitaire is a game that can get boring after a while -- especially if you find yourself on the receiving end of several unsolvable decks. Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! strips that annoyance away by offering only solvable decks -- this insures that everybody in the tournament has a fair chance at winning. If you fancy yourself a good player, Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! is a worthy download.", "date": "Feb 21, 2004"}
