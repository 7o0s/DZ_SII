Featuring classic sequences such as the Battle for Hoth -- easily one of the most revisited scenes for video games -- and the deliciously melodramatic reveal of Luke Skywalker lineage, Empire remains riveting. Seeing the title on the decks should act as a tractor beam for fans, drawing them one click down to take a second look.The cross section of Star Wars fans and hardcore gamers will be disappointed in Empire Strikes Back, mainly because it's a collection of scenes without any deep game play. But I suspect this is strictly by design. The focus on casual mechanics certainly grants the game accessibility, something that likely kept a lot mobile gamers at arm's length from the mobile maker's massive suite of Revenge of the Sith games a few years ago. (That, and simple over-saturation.)Starting on the ice world of Hoth and ending in the escape from Bespin, Empire touches on every key moment from the movie. Each sequence offers a different play style, from the balancing act of wrapping an AT-ATs legs in a tow cable by pressing left or right depending on the arc of Luke's speeder to the more action-oriented push through the depths of the Cloud City. Some scenes work better than others. My favorite was the Hoth battle, followed by the asteroid field run. Luke's raid on the Cloud City is messy, thanks to strangely sloppy controls and some bizarre, choppy framerate. (I tested the game on a Motorola V9, hardly a slouch of a phone.)With the exception of the Bespin action scenes, Empire relies on very simple mechanics. Luke's run through the Degobah swamp with Yoda is very easy to get your thumb around. Luke is always running with Yoda on his back and it's up to you to time jumps across swamp water correctly, nail vine grabs, and then balance rocks and R2 by jamming on the direction pad so none of the objects fall. As the Falcon rips through the asteroid field, you simply move the ship left and right to avoid incoming rocks. When TIEs catch up to you, you just move a cursor around the top of the screen and shoot at Vader's ships when the reticle turns red.While some of these easy scenes are more engaging than others, none set you up properly for the very iffy Bespin battle. You control Luke as he runs through corridors, taking cover and returning fire against wave after wave of storm troopers. The shooting works, but when Luke must use his lightsaber to deflect shots and cut down troopers, the game tumbles. The strike distance for the saber seems all over the map. Standing next to a storm trooper and slashing may take down one guy, but not the next. You'll take a lot of damage during these scenes, although there are health packs that replenish lost vitality.I should point out that Empire has three difficulty levels. The easy setting, Padawan, is a breeze. You are better off juicing the difficulty up to Jedi if you want anything resembling a challenge. Plus, the higher the level, the more points you earn during each scene.Empire looks great. THQ Wireless enjoys the rights to actor likenesses, so when Han speaks, you see Harrison Ford's unmistakable mug. The recreation of the scenes is solid, such as the icy landscapes of Hoth to the heart of Cloud City. Sometimes watching for button prompts takes your eyes off of the cool action, though. The lightsaber fight with Darth Vader is a good example. I want to see Luke and Vader exchange blows, but I couldn't look away from a meter all the way up in the upper-right corner of the screen.And then there were the chugging issues in Bespin. The game would stutter as Luke ran and fought. I would press forward and fire to swing at a storm trooper, only to suddenly see the trooper on the ground and Luke standing right in the way of another enemy's line of fire.Empire Strikes Back goes casual to cast a wide net and it's a sound strategy. I think mobile gamers more in tune with Bejeweled or Tower Bloxx will get a lot more out of Empire than a hardcore gamer that was drawn to mobile by the appearance of Empire. Save for some issues in Bespin, the game looks good and the use of music straight out of the movie really sets the scene. While not completely out of this world, Empire is a good download for Star Wars fans that wanna sneak a Force fix into their every day routines.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
