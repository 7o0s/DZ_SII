Once the core developers feel they have gotten a title right innovation seems to cease and 'status quo' becomes the order of the day.  Unfortunately, that trend has found its way into NCAA GameBreaker 2001.  So, while the game is not a complete bust, and it does have gameplay value, this college football game could -- and should -- have been done to keep the gameplay on par with all the media hype.   Gameplay The folks over at 989 have proven time and again that they have mastered the art of presenting a sports videogame.  They have done so with every title they have churned out-each year.  The same held true for last years GameBreaker 2000 and holds true for NCAA 2001 as well.  So, as has become standard, this year's game is loaded to the gills with goodies.  You have 115 Division 1-A teams, 64 classic teams, an enhanced Total Control Passing interface sporting the new MAX-PRO Protection, more than 20 Bowl games, additional commentary from the legendary Keith Jackson and the return of the Career mode.   Cute and effective, players make use of the ~Athletic Department~ to set up their pre-game preferences.  You can view the rosters, do some Blue Chip recruiting, find which students have chosen your school via the Letter of Intent Day, create walk-on players, load and save your teams and even edit the schedule.  Hey!  You folks have asked for all of these features and 989 has made certain to deliver them.  Not bad at all.   Customizing the game options encompasses all the traditional features such as Game Speed, Music/No Music, Penalties, Injuries, Player Sizes, Camera Modes and a partridge in a pear tree too.  All this takes place amongst Scrimmages, Fantasy Leagues, Tournament Seasons, Bowl Seasons and the big Bowls, such as the Rose Bowl, Gator Bowl and Cotton Bowl.   As you progress through these various modes and contests, and I would recommend them all as they all have some inherent benefit or value, you will find that the game does a more than fair job of culminating all the various statistical disciplines for the teams and players.  If you do well enough over the course of a season, your player will then be able to compete for the Heisman Trophy and even more position-specific accolades.  This type of attention to detail and software inherent competition has proven valuable to the game's replay value.  For those who play a lot of games against the CPU, competition against oneself makes for some far less lonely nights of fun with the ole' PlayStation.  Then, to add one more chip to the pot, 989 has organized the player milestones onto each team's 'Homepage.'  This makes monitoring Heisman-like performances a breeze throughout the season.   But the players aren't the only ones who get a shot at being benchmarked and hoisted above the player's shoulders.  Career Mode enables you operate as a real college coach.  Do well, and it means bigger better gigs at bigger better schools.  Blow it and you are a cooked goose.  This facet of GameBreaker 2001 adds a whole heap variety to the experience, and 989 should be applauded for implementing this type of diversity into its games so well.   But if it is the epitome of the armchair Quarterback you are looking for, we need to spend a moment examining the effects of, the now classic, Total Control Passing on your game.  As always, the use of TCP is something that must be mastered to be fully appreciated.  If you have followed the progression of the GameBreaker franchise, you know that the purpose of implementing this type of passing enhancement was solely to make the game seem much more accurate in how the ball can be delivered to waiting receivers.  It gives the player the ability to lead or underthrow receivers much like a real NCAA Quarterback does. As it turns out it is very effective, and depending upon which difficulty level you choose to play the CPU with, it can prove to be too effective.  Basically, all it takes is a little practice and a decent ability to read the action as it unfolds on the field and ~Bingo~ you will be burning the secondary for critical yards and some big gains by not relying solely upon timing routes and gross coverage mismatches to move the ball during an aerial attack.   For instance, if you choose a play that floods the left side of the field with three potential receivers, and there is one cutting to the outside, and the clock is short on time so you need to go out of bounds-you can use TCP to lead the receiver cutting outside even further to the left so that by the time the ball is delivered and caught, you will be able to carry the player's momentum right into the white chalk for a time stoppage.  That is not the only way TCP can be used, but it certainly illustrates one of the critical benefits of knowing how to use it.   Then of course there is the new one-button special move interface.  This is a blessing and a curse. For the novice, one-button special moves are a dream.  Instantly, by relying solely on one-button (much like playing Dead or Alive...hehe) a novice can achieve great results, especially in the 'run-after-catch' and ground game scenarios.  Mash away at that one lame-oh button and you can perform all sorts of evasive maneuvers to make your side look gameplay savvy.  However, if you dare venture in, you will find there is a deep and involved advanced Defensive/Offensive scheme that will aid in making the game much more involved and deeper in the long run (no pun intended there folks).   And if those aspects are not enough to get you interested, there is also some decent play editing and custom playbook stuff that can really enhance one's ability to feel a part of the whole package.  You can even go so far as to customize the whole darn playbook if you like.   So we know a bit about the workings of the game, in terms of interface issues and configuration modes, so how does that translate into on-the-field control and enjoyment of the sport?  Well, the answers are many.   In general, GameBreaker 2001 is not a marked improvement over the last effort from 989 Sports.  The addition of MAX-PRO, where you can assign the Running Back to block prior to the snap, seems to be the most useful enhancement.  The problem is, sometimes even it doesn't quite work as planned. I found that I would command the Running Back to block and on occasion he would just run a route instead.  Obviously this is what is called a 'bug' and is one that should have been examined a bit more closely.  Now one could argue that this is simulation of human error, but I don't chose to buy that line this time around.   Other aspects of the gameplay that require commenting include the running game, the defensive secondary and the blistering speed of some cheating AI on defense when coming across the field on a big pass play.  Balance is the key to getting a football game right.  Let alone the complexities of getting the CPU to execute complex play schemes, routes and pursuit angles to perfection. Fortunately the running game is workable and the passing interface is malleable enough to make play execution easy enough to be fun.   In all fairness to 989 Sports, it has done a nice job of bringing the player a diverse set of plays and variables to make the game seem as much like football as (almost) possible.  The problem lies in the fact that the game compensates for exploitations using the tired method of cheating. Individual player ratings should be so clearly defined that simply by placing a better or stronger player into a certain position-on the filed-should yield different results. But when you see a guy you know can't run the 40 in 4.4 in full pads making an uncharacteristic dash across the field for a huge play-you have to wonder.   This problem is not 989-specific.  Other titles, from other companies, in other genres have made use of this quick and easy method to adjust so-called computer AI.  The truth is that it is purely a cheat and makes the games seem less immersive once the player catches on to what is going on inside the brain of the CPU.  That's the case here with GameBreaker 2001.  With all the wonderful modifications there are to customize the game's CPU, Speed, Clock Speed, IQ and such, there seems a clear lack of any real AI adjustments other than to cheat less athletically inclined players into positions they would fail to achieve in real life.   For example, I substituted a dummied-up player I created as a D-Lineman. Then, by adjusting the AI in the game, I ran dozens of plays to see what would occur.  This pitiful excuse for a football player was 'da-man' on many plays.  He was matched against a guy who should have dominated him entirely, but that was not the case.  These kinds of things should not happen.  Even worse, had the AI acted properly, in this situation, the CPU opponent should have tried pounding the ball to the side of the line to exploit that weakness.  Needless to say, that did not happen.  Sure, this may seem a bit complex for an evaluation, but when the games coming out do not boast anything monumental in terms of innovation, you have nothing left to seriously critique but the details.   As with GameDay 2001, GameBreaker 2001 has some issues with bad coverage routes and a host of money plays that makes going after the Easter Eggs unnecessary.  In no time I was able to find several plays on both offense and defense that allowed me to wreak some major havoc on the other team. This has been an ongoing issue with the 989 football titles and one that could have been fixed or at least improved, had something been done to the game to correct the problem.   Graphics Abysmal load times are but one of a few issues found with the graphics package in this title.  Collision, while sloppy in some areas, is generally good and responsive.  This is in spite of a poor frame rate.  But it seems as if 989 has mashed together a variety of old and newer mo-caps.  I can recall how fluid this game played and took out an old one to test my theory. Going back two years ago, several of the animations just ran smoother or exhibited better transitional phases.  This year the game fluxes with regard to the fluid nature of the motion and control and the visual consistency of the animations used.  It is that simple.  Something is rotten in Denmark, and I can't quite put my finger on it.   Here is a better stab at making the point.  Just like last year's offering, the graphics in GameBreaker 2001 are solid for a 32-bit title but are showing serious signs of fatigue.  This is especially so in the light of other offerings.  We praised the player models last year for sporting an even higher polygon count than the year prior, but even at their, now, seemingly highest values, the laboring frame-rate, dithering and overall sluggishness in presentation of the game's graphics has really awakened the need for more fertile and powerful ground upon which to build.   There are no glaring complaints with regard to the color palette, although GameDay always seemed a hair up on the two titles in this area.  Tactilely the game remains sound only in that it is more responsive than the frame rate would suggest.  This leads me to believe that it must be a simple issue of dropping frames (for the purpose of including more animations) that has lead to the collective feeling that the game is choppy.  I can remember when Madden on PlayStation was in fact frame rate deficient, yet played very well in spite of that fact.  Now it seems that GameBreaker has traveled down the same path.  Pound for pound, I would call it a valiant effort, but the mishaps and missteps found along the way shortchange a title that once boasted the smoothest frame rate in the business.   Sound All right, here it is.  I like Keith Jackson's commentary.  I hate the overused, tired, boring, hypnotic, trance-inducing lazy, looped crowd sounds.  I like the hits.  I hate the overused, tired, boring, hypnotic, trance-inducing lazy, lopped crowd sounds.  I like the grunts.  I hate the overused, tired, boring hypnotic, trance-inducing lazy, lopped crowd sounds. I like the music.  I hate the overused, tired, boring, hypnotic, trance-inducing lazy, looped crowd sounds.  The band sounds pretty good.  I hate the overused, tired, boring, hypnotic, trance-inducing lazy, looped crowd sounds.   Have I made my point?  Yes, the sound files are still a bit course, but with age my ears have lost some sensitivity so I am less apt to complain about that as much.  But...I hate the overused, tired, boring...you get the point! Nuff said!So how do I wrap up my true feelings about this game?  Besides these glaringissues, GameBreaker 2001 does have a fun factor that cannot be denied.  Theexcitement of college football is conveyed with some relative believabilityand once you hear those drums fire up, you have to acknowledge the fact thatcollege ball is really electrifying.  Handicapping the game, knowing fullwell it is on old hardware and pushing the 2 MB of RAM to their max, willalleviate some of the frustration found in playing the title.  While NCAA2001 from EA remains the winner in this race, diehard GameBreaker fans willstill enjoy the overall look and feel of this college pigskin classic. You still have what amounts to a very arcade-like game, but one that hastaken a serious nosedive from the applause it received just one year ago.Maybe the real reason for this stumble is that 989 is feverishly working ona 128-bit version for PS2.  That being the case, we may overlook theproblems found here, and suffice to view this title as mere 'holding pattern' entertainment.  Does it suck...No!  Could it be better...Yes!  Should you buyit...Depends.  Give it a try and see if it will whet your appetite until nextseason.", "date": "Sep 16, 2000"}
