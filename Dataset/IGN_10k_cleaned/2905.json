However every once and a while a game which has a cinematic tie delivers the goods.The Thing is just such a game. Being based on the John Carpenter film from the early 1980s, The Thing sees you investigating some mysterious goings on at a remote Antarctic research station.Naturally all is not well and before long you stumble across scenes of terrible carnage and evidence that extra terrestrial life forms are a part of the problem (there is also a manmade conspiracy too!). Now it is up to you and your fellow US Army special operations troops to make sense of this mess and restore order to the chaotic area.The Thing is a suspenseful game to play for a number of reasons. For a start you and your squad mates are all susceptible to infestation and once infested could attack each other. So you don't always know if the chaps who are supposed to be supporting you in the field are friend or foe.The knowledge that anyone could become infested, combined with the stressful nature of the mission, also has an impact on your squad mates and you must keep them calm by ensuring that any wounds they have are healed and that they can protect themselves. Often giving your squad mates a gun will calm then down. However this can backfire if they then become infested by the parasite and turn on you, which makes for some entertaining and paradoxical moments.Evidence of this is sometimes pretty obvious as your fellow troopers will sometimes suffer from uncontrollable fits of vomiting -- something which looks pretty funny the first time you see it.Being in an isolated area where the temperature is as cold as forty degrees below zero means you cannot operate safely for long periods outside and this adds to the tension. Stay outside for too long and you will succumb to the elements. However being inside has its own obvious attendant dangers so the game keeps you on the edge of your seat as you try and survive in very hostile conditions.So The Thing can be quite vexing to play as you will be often without ammunition and unable to escape shambling mounds of mutant flesh which is clawing at you, leaping at your throat or spitting this gross acid stuff which looks a lot like microwaved snot (don't ask us how we know this by the way!).There are tape recorders which you can use to save your progress, but these aren't always in convenient locations, so sometimes you will palpably feel the desperation of having a few rounds of ammunition left as you are nearly overrun. Luckily you can find a fair bit of ammunition about the place, but again this isn't always in the most convenient location so you have to make sure you are judicious and not too trigger-happy.As you have probably guessed there is a fair bit of gunplay in this game. That said sometimes your conventional guns aren't powerful enough to kill some of the bigger alien abominations you come across. In some instances you'll need to use your guns to bring down the shambling mounds of alien flesh and then, once they have been immobilised, you will have to burn them with a flamethrower to finish them off.Mastering the quick switch to flamethrower and then becoming good at avoiding the spot fires you start is a really vital skill and sometimes it is hard not too seriously burn yourself. The fairly fixed weapon aiming system helps contribute to the problems you occasionally suffer in this regard and while the game does let you indulge in three weapon accuracy settings these seem to apply to everything except the flamethrowers, which are sometimes hard to use with anything less than a haphazard spray. Being unable to aim up or down also makes this hard, especially when you have smaller creatures attacking you from below your field of vision as they rip into your feet.So the aiming interface isn't perfect, but it still manages to not get in the way of the ballistic bliss most of the time.The Thing is for the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way you keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience.What did you think of The Thing?There is only one aspect of the game which deserves much criticism and that is the fact that the controls can sometimes feel a little imprecise, especially during a busy fire fight. However this very minor niggle is not enough to stop this game from receiving a glowing recommendation. Play it at night with your PC speakers turned up loud if you dare!The Thing has come out of nowhere and mutated into something that many of us will love.
