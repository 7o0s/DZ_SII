Seeking to expand into strategy gaming, the development house decided (wisely) not to issue another carbon copy real-time strategy game. Instead they put together Ruthless.com, a clever little strategy game that is very different from the swamp of other titles on the shelf. The problem is, while the game is certainly unique it its conception, it doesn't really have the depth to stand up to repeated play. Here's a quick look at what's right and wrong with this intriguing new take on the turn based strategy game.  At its core, Ruthless.com is a cross between Othello and Capitalism in a high-tech setting. You take on the role of a startup software company looking to grab the biggest market-share and profits for your products. To do this you must build R&D departments that will develop new ideas into products, Marketing departments to convince people that those products are the best on the market, HR departments that will help bring new talent into your offices, and Administration offices to help hold everything together. Of course, since the name of the game here is Ruthless.com, you can also build Legal departments to sue your enemies and issue patents while defending yourself from the same, Computer Cores that can release viruses into your foe's departments, an Acquisition department that is able to buy your opponent's buildings out from under them and a Security department to engage your opponent with blackmail, firebombings and if necessary, assassination.  While this may all sound very exciting, it's all represented abstractly on a grid of different colored squares. Each building constructed in the game appears on this map and can hold up to six separate departments. The colored squares represent areas that you hold a lock on consumer purchases. Okay, now things get a little bit hard to follow - each product housed within a building gives that building an additional square to its 'reach' radius. When your reach overlaps that of a competitor, the company with the highest product quality wins the square. On each given turn, your CEO gets a chance to engage in two actions (from fireboming an opponent to developing a new product idea) and each executive you've hired (or acquired) can pitch in with one action of their own. It's actually a lot easier than it sounds, and the game comes with a tutorial that helps you through the learning process fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, once you've learned all the tricks of the trade, there's not enough depth to the game to make you want to play for more than a couple of days. Basically you spend your time building up products while trying to make sure that enemies cannot harm your buildings. Once an enemy gets too close (or too powerful) you switch tactics and shut 'em down. I'm not saying the game's not challenging, the AI, especially on the highest level, is excellent. It's just that once you played about twelve or thirteen games, you'll feel like you've seen everything the game has to offer.  Some extended interest can be squeezed out of the six scenarios that are included with the title. Instead of starting you off as a lone company trying to cut out your market (as in the campaign mode), the scenario mode sets you up in an existing situation with a set of goals that must be accomplished by a certain turn in order to win. The one I enjoyed the most forces you and your competitors to work together in defeating a huge conglomerate called EvilSoft. After the bad guy goes down, all bets are off and you'llbe backsatbbing those who were just helping you out.  The game allows multiplayer play, which is exactly like the single player mode with your friends taking the place of the computer opponents. All players take turns simultaneously with the results being shown at the beginning of the next round. Internet play is available through M-Player and other matching services for those who are registered.  In the end, Ruthless.com provided me with a brief distraction for a couple of days. This turns out to be one of those titles that, while structurally sound, just doesn't do anything to set itself in front of the herd. Still, if you have a low capability system or you're willing to wait until the game hits the bargain bins there's some entertainment value to be gleaned from this title.  -- Trent C.
