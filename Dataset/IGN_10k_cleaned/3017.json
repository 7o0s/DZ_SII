Split like rogue atoms from the cluster center of Rare in 1999, Free Radical burst onto the gaming scene in 2000 with a built-in heritage in console first-person shooters and a company name, though strangely different, to live up to.Eager and capable to create a PS2 game at the system launch (a hefty task if ever there was one), under publisher Eidos, Free Radical created TimeSplitters, a fast, 60-fps game essentially void of a worthy single-player mode, but nonetheless a game clearly boasting the developer's propensity for technical wizardry, fondness for goofy characters, and some of the most multiplayer console fun since, well, let's just say, in a long time. TimeSplitters 2 is the answer to all that was not quite right with its predecessor. The game boasts the same blazing first-person shooter engine, only enhanced with sharper visuals and more effects, non-stop 60 fps action, a great multiplayer mode, and a substantial single-player mode. Perhaps what's best about this game, though, isn't all of its fresh new qualities. I mean, they're all meaningful and important, but in my mind they're not what's most important. More than anything else, Free Radical's reinvigorates in me a feeling from a game long past, delivering a verifiably genuine addictive quality that I have been waiting for oh so long.GameplayBase on the first easy-to-play, bubblegum blaster, Free Radical's second first-person shooter, like all good sequels, takes the core concept and expands upon it. The central themes for TimeSplitters were speed, beauty and multiplayer goodness. TimeSplitters 2 does everything in its power to present these qualities, while simultaneously offering a game that's also a fun single-player title loaded with rewards, cheats, extra characters and modes of play. It's still blazingly fast and pretty, running constantly at 60 frames per second, with no noticeable slowdown, and packed with a Story mode organized by difficulty levels, enabling players to amuse themselves with entirely new objectives, sectors of play, and more difficult AI. And the load times are all speedy short. Though sadly missing the much-anticipated online function Eidos once promised, TimeSplitters 2 is still an electrifying first-person shooter, crafted with care, humor and intelligence. Offering a healthy set of modes, TimeSplitters 2 also gives gamers a wealth of options. Under Options players can tweak their controls, audio and video options, view cutscenes, see cheats, trailers and credits. The most robust of these is Player options. Players can tweak six different controller setups, including Custom, alter ~Preferences,~ including items such as turning on or off auto aim, inverse look, vibration, and view statistics, which is a funny little jaunt in itself. These guys were always sticklers for statistics, and TimeSplitters 2 is no exception. Players can check the statistics of standard things such as the time they have played, distance traveled, total games, total kills, accuracy, etc. The more eccentric items are what we were after, and these little stats pleased me sinfully. You can check ~Insomnia~ (the longest stretch of time played in one sitting), ~Average speed,~ melons burst, animal cruelty, limbs detached, head knocked off, UFOs spotted, and for a touch of Grand Theft Auto, Longest Killing Spree. Also worth noting are the Arcade Awards, given for players of the Challenge mode, and Gallery, which shows how many of the 126 characters are playable in the game. These include standard AI dummies, bosses, lead characters, and dozens of others, giving this game a slew of incentives for replaying it again and again. Single-Player ModeWhat the first TimeSplitters sorely missed was a single-player mode worth playing. The game featured one, but it was essentially capture the flag, and it was substantially more difficult than it was worth. TimeSplitters 2, on the other hand, delivers on the promise of a meaty single-player experience by bringing 10 levels to the table. What? Only 10 levels? True, that isn't generous. But these 10 levels are structured much in the same way Goldeneye 007 was -- with new objectives added for each new difficulty level, more locations opened up and challenges to meet. Beat the game on the relatively easy ~Easy~ level, and then play through on medium, and all of a sudden the map you knew has grown, the passages you take altered, and the enemies not only harder to kill, but smarter, too. By finishing the game on ~Easy~ you have essentially missed 30-40% of the game. It's not like beating Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racconus and missing a few bottles. Here, you simply miss out on huge sections of addictive gameplay. The new difficulty levels add substantially fulfilling challenges that had this gamer swearing, cussing, and prophesizing the end of his gaming career if he didn't beat the Atom Smasher level over the weekend. Unlike Red Faction 2, THQ's story-driven first-person shooter, TimeSplitters 2 is not story-driven. It's an objective-based game. The story does indeed exist, but it's little more than say, the story provided for Doom, which is to say, the story is not where it's at. You follow the plot of an elite squad of military personnel bent on chasing the evil TimeSplitters through time, capturing crystals key to controlling time, and at the same time, history. In the 10 basic levels, spread out over history, players fight their way to the time crystal, beat up bosses, sometimes more than one in a level, and then find the warp hole back to the ship in which your two lead characters, Sgt. Cortez and Corp Hart, are harbored.  In each time level, you take on the roles of select characters, into which Sgt. Cortez or Corp Hart take form. I found little depth in the characters, little reason to like them -- other than that they are apparently saving the world from some abstract disaster -- and felt no real compassion for them. Why do I care about them? Who are they really? How do they fit into the big picture of the world? These are not issues addressed in TimeSplitters 2 because the story is essentially irrelevant. But honestly, when I look back at Rare's blockbuster spy game on Nintendo 64, was that game really story driven? Nah. It was just like this game, objective-driven. So, TimeSplitters 2 does what it sets out to do with this story, and for the most part it succeeds. The Story mode offers 10 levels, all based in different time periods, and while some are better than others, they're all relatively medium in length (longer, obviously, when you play the medium and hard level). The levels include 1990 Siberia, 1932 Chicago, 1895 Notre Dame, 2280 Return to Planet X, NeoTokyo, 1858 Wild West, 1972 Atom Smasher, 1920 Aztec Ruins, 2315 Robot Factory, 2401 Space Station. Each of the 10 levels offers something different. The first level, 1990 Siberia, is clearly a parody to the first level of Goldeneye, an ~answer~ to those fiendish Bond fans who tried so desperately to reach that little island on the other side of the dam in that game's first level. It's also probably the largest and best level of the game, unifying careful sniping, stealth and straight-out action elements into one nearly perfect level. Chicago is also superb in its combination of stealth and sniping. I also loved the third level Notre Dame, thanks to the appearance of (minor SPOILERS ahead) the hunchback of Notre Dame and two bosses. Both Atom Smasher and Aztec Ruins were also handled superbly. But some levels didnt satisfy at all. At the same time Atom Smasher is a classic parody of any late '60s/early '70s Bond film, it's a devil of a level to beat, creating great frustration and annoyance to this gamer -- mostly because the AI makes a substantial jump in toughness at this level. Then there are levels such as Return to Planet X, which are simply dull and uninspired, providing little of what Free Radical does best. And while Wild West was a ~hoot~ to play for a few minutes, it was surprisingly short, unimaginative and lacking in the fun department. And call it what you will, but NeoTokyo is such a brazen rip-off/parody of a Perfect Dark level, fans of that game are sure to split over either loving or hating it. Other modes of play include Arcade (League, Custom, and Network), Challenge (skill and time based challenges), and the formidable Mapmaker mode (which I'll talk about in a bit). Also, and this has become a much more popular concept over the years, the Story mode is playable with two players in Co-op mode, another bonus. Challenge is fun and entertaining; it's great for people to gather around and compete over, offering time and skill based challenges. One level (Glass Smash: Pane in the Neck) requires you to knock out all of the windows from the Siberia level using a grenade launcher: Beat it in less than 18 seconds and win a gold metal. Beat it in less than 30, and win a silver, and less than 1 minute for a bronze. These modes mix single and multiplayer values together to create an imaginative party atmosphere, but they can be played entirely alone, too.    Multiplayer Where TimeSplitters 2 slips a little here and there, it surpasses all others in its Multiplayer mode. As a four-person deathmatch in the style of its great predecessor, Free Radical's game is unrivaled on the system. The game offers 16 various kinds of multiplayer games that are sure to thrill gamers with more than one controller in their houses. Like the first game, Free Radical is seriously dedicated to making first-person shooters a pure roller-coaster ride of well-balanced multi-player fun, and the developer has succeeded with greatness here. For those who simply a like a little deathmatch, it holds its own with 16 solid initial levels of play. This time around the game levels are much better designed. Players are less likely to find themselves stuck in a long hallway being blasted to smithereens, or deep down in a cellar wondering where the hell everyone else is hiding. The bots range from decent to solid. They also pack a decidedly weird punch -- monkeys show up from time to time (they're very small targets, mind you), and the AI characters perform interesting tactics. They shuffle and strafe on their own. The hop from side to side to avoid shots, and the monkeys do cartwheels to avoid your fire. AI bots also slide occasionally, a bizarre behavior that's fun but annoying. Other options include team Deathmatch, Capture the Bag, Bag Tag, Elimination, Shrink, Vampire, Thief, Flame Tag, Virus, Regeneration, Leech, Zones, Assault, Gladiator, and Monkey Assistant, which is course features the game's spectacular monkeys. Players can customize their levels with great detail. The selections include Score Limit, Score Method, One Shot Kill, Time Limit, Always Start With Gun, Display Radar, Handicaps, Character Abilities, Powerups, and Music. Like in the first game, players also can modify their weapon sets (with preset 15 choices and custom setups), and Bot sets (also with 15 selection types). With 16 weapons, not including the options for x2, players can stylize their levels for mass destruction or for careful, pinpoint precision. The multiplayer levels game contends heavily for the heart of TimeSplitters 2. It's so robust and carefully oriented for a great party game that it's hard not to simply skip the single player modes and head straight for multiplayer mode. Players of simple four-player multiplayer are sure to be happy, but there's also iLink Network play as well. Players can link two, three or four PS2s for a little LAN action (using the Network adaptor, but not connecting online) or an iLink party (using iLink cables). Either way, the game supports four-person play. Last but not least, Free Radical has again implemented the Mapmaker function, so players can create their own maps in which to do battle. There are more pieces to use (more halls and multi-door rooms), which creates better options, but from what I can tell, there aren't the storied levels offered in the first game. No matter, the option choices are huge. Players can develop huge maps with incredible ease in less than 10 minutes. You can choose spawn points, portals, all sorts of weapons, place objects such as crates, choose music, room color, and more. And each of the various maps weighs in on your 8 MB Memory Card at slim sizes, enabling many to be stored on a single Card.   GraphicsTimeSplitters 2 is a great looking game. Much like the first game, everything from the characters to the backgrounds to the weapons is consistently designed blending an encouraging simplicity with a respectable level of detail and animation. Improvements in the graphics department feature more of everything, to be honest. Top of the list is its excellent set of special effects. The sheer amount of lasers, light and smoke, dust, and sparks are eye opening. In some levels these special effects appear more significantly than others. For instance, gamers will undoubtedly notice the unruly amount of lighting appearing in the Robot Factory -- where the Sci Fi gun shots bounce off walls -- and Siberia levels. In NeoTokyo, players find themselves in a rainy, Blade Runner-esque world, where sheets of rain pour down, portrayed with excellent water and blur effects. In other levels, the fire effects are also noticeable, though I've found that it's almost impossible to identify a clear sense of space and distance near anything that's on fire, causing self-inflicted harm than necessary. The animation is more than noticeable. The characters are conveyed in a fluid, seamless fashion, with a respectable level of body movement, though they show less than ideal amount of facial movement or expression. The backgrounds range from highly detailed -- as in Siberia, Chicago, Aztec, and Robot Factory, to the less than admirable Atom Smasher, Wild West, and Return to Planet X. The levels also range in size, with some locales being larger and providing greater distances than others, including, once again, the star levels Siberia and Chicago. Perhaps the game's biggest visual weakness is its character design. While featuring 120-plus characters, none of these hilariously named characters are interesting looking on their own. Perhaps it's just the style thats less than charismatic, but while they move well, the characters aren't terribly charming, enticing or eye catching. Again, they are named hilariously, and there are many of them, but yeah, well, you get the picture.SoundWhile offering the basic stereo sound, TimeSplitters 2 creates an excellent mix of original music with suitable songs for each level. The techno beat that underlies most of the themes is clear and crisp, and where appropriate, it diverts to the right sound for that particular time and place. For instance, there is very little music in the Western level, but the balance of sound effects music and silence works perfectly.  It's amazing what a little silence does for a level. In all, the music and sound effects are excellent.  While Free Radical is still quite young as an individual development house, it's already earned itself quite a reputation. Or rather, the team's history precedes it with a resonance and power few newbie developers could ask for, or for that matter, warrant. TimeSplitters 2 is the team's best effort of two titles, and it shows off its ability to create a finely tuned, highly customizable, intensely exciting first-person console shooter. Crafted in the rather young tradition of console-specific first-person shooters, Free Radical's dedication to a solid single-player game is skillfully demonstrated here, but as with the first, the multiplayer wins again for its immense customization, improved multiplayer levels, and the simple yet addictive Mapmaker function. TimeSplitters 2 is clearly the best multiplayer first-person shooter on the system, and in many ways the game, as an entire package, competes with the best FPS games on PlayStation 2. While the Story mode is 100% better than the first game, it's still not a story-driven game, and at times I felt a little empty running and gunning with little empathy for the characters. All in all, TimeSplitters 2 is an excellent choice and a highly recommended game, deep with choices, options, and tons of cheats, rewards, and bonuses.", "date": "Oct 7, 2002"}
