{"name": "Maximum Force", "name_review": "Maximum Force", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/25/maximum-force", "text": "The light gun genre has to be one of the weakest on the PlayStation. Really strong titles are few and far between - the genre is mostly occupied by a dog pile of second rate shooters. Take Revolution X for example. OK, don't. But you get where I'm coming from. Maximum Force isn't as bad as Revolution X or some of the other ones floating around, but it's no Time Crisis either.  Built by the same team that designed Area 51, Maximum Force has a similar digitized style as the former. Terrorists have taken over three different locales, and it's up to the player to take them out. It's actually three games in one. The first takes place on a series of boats, and is by far the most interesting. Another occurs on the city's streets.  Gameplay is pretty much just standard light gun fare. The camera tracks smoothly around, offering terrorists to shoot at and hostages to miss. Occasionally it does something interesting, like go underwater or scale up a building, but the majority of it is just standard Area 51 stuff.  Unless you've got money to burn, save yourself some grief and wait for Time Crisis.", "date": "Sep 25, 1997"}
