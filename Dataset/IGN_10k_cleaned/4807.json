Featuring a slick mix of action, platforming, and super spy cool, it remains a fan favorite -- and deserving of homage. Lightplay, a mobile game maker, does its best with Dual Threat to deliver said homage.   Features:   Play as two characters  Each character has a different storyline  Multiple weapons   Lightplay has some serious ambitions for Dual Threat, wanting it to be more than a rote side-croller where you shoot anything that moves. It took the time to infuse the game with a plot that changes, depending on which of the two main characters you play as. On top of this, the enemies and weapons in Dual Threat have real-word attributes that affect game play.   The setting for Dual Threat: Philadelphia, Summer of 1982. It is officially one of the hottest summers on record -- bringing out that serious ~Summer in the City~ vibe. (Cue The Lovin' Spoonful.) Two superstar detectives, Bobby Archer and Marcus Brown, are assigned to take down The Duce -- a crime syndicate. During the investigation against The Duce, Brown is dismissed for using excessive force -- but is covertly helping Archer finish the job.   At the beginning of Dual Threat, you select either Archer or Brown. Depending on which character you choose, the game features a different angle on the main plot. Archer's more of an aboveground guy, while Brown dishes out vigilante-style action.   The gameplay is pure Rolling Thunder. As the lanky detectives, you storm the scene as shoot bad guys while finishing your objectives, such as planting a wiretap on the telephone. Bad guys are plenty, and you have a variety of bang-bang to use against them.   However, you need to consider your actions before diving headlong into the scene. For example, using the pistol makes enough noise to attract other henchmen. And while you can take a few shots, if enough bad dudes hit the area, you're ventilated.  You can only imagine what kind of racket the shotgun makes. To keep things quiet, use the stun gun and finish the job with your fists.   Combat, though, is somewhat uneven. It took forever for us to blast down a bad guy, and the controls didn't seem to react as fast as necessary to finish off enemies without taking excessive damage.    Platform elements fare better, as Archer and Brown scale crates and shimmy across overhead pipes. A very slick addition is the ability to slip into a ventilations haft and crawl along undetected.   Despite only having two areas -- warehouse and apartment complex -- there is some serious depth to Dual Threat. The enemies are smart and fast (perhaps too much, considering some control issues), providing a real challenge. Dual Threat is no cakewalk. And with twin stories to play through, you have two walks that are without cake. We like getting as much for own download dollars as possible, and for that reason, Dual Threat delivers.   Dual Threat looks pretty good -- you will immediately notice the resemblance to Rolling Thunder. The skinny detectives are the first thing we noticed. Both levels are very well-detailed for a wireless game, using plenty of color. The audio is good, but not great, as we wish the game would have included more sound samples.Dual Threat is a good game that will suffer because it lacks a recognizable license. The name Dual Threat was made to get lost on a crowded deck. Which is too bad, because it's a great value for your money -- lots of gameplay. Lightplay may be focusing on mobile entertainment, but this is one of those rare handset titles that I saw serious console potential in. Come on, who wouldn't want to play a side-scrolling Rolling Thunder homage with Xbox graphics?", "date": "Jun 26, 2004"}
