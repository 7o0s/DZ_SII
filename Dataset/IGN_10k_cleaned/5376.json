{"name": "Magic Carpet", "name_review": "Magic Carpet", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/magic-carpet", "text": "Magic Carpet is another one of those games that got ported from the PC. Unlike a lot of those games, Magic Carpet has retained what made the original so popular - the gameplay. Sure, the graphics are somewhat simple compared to other PlayStation games, but it's the game itself that really shines here.  Magic Carpet combines elements of flight sims, RPG's, shooters, and management games into one coherent package. You fly around on your rug, casting spells, shooting fireballs at big worms, and building castles, all with the help of magic. The greater your power, the better your spells.  The landscape is somewhat barren, but what is there (trees, villages, lakes) responds to your magic permanently. This means if you scorch the earth with a fireball, it'll stay scorched. It's the little details that really make Magic Carpet worth exploring.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
