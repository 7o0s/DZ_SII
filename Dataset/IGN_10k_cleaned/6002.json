In fact, the incoming ringtone on my Sanyo 8200 (which is sadly on its last legs) is the opening theme of Pac-Man. And when it goes off around other people I actually catch the occasional person smiling to themselves. I've also heard numerous variations on ~Well, I guess we know who here is a gamer.~ Which is exactly why I downloaded it in the first place.   Namco has expanded its effort to bring its vid-themed ringer to mobile phones with the release of Pac-Man's Arcade Corner. Actually, I think it's a bad name -- as it's might confuse some into thinking they're buying a suite of Pac-Man games, rather than access to a ringtone library.   Buying into Pac-Man's Arcade Corner throws open the doors to a massive collection of tones from Namco's library. Everything from classic themes (Xevious and Mappy) to more recent releases (Klonoa 2 and Soul Calibur) are available for browsing, previewing, and if so inclined to spend purchased credits -- download. However, in addition to game tones, Namco has beefed the library with ringtones of popular songs. Pink, Gwen Stefani, and more can be listened to and downloaded. The library reaches further back than radio hits, too, so even an eighties fan -- who would likely want to install a Pac-Man ringer -- can juice their handset with, say, ~Shout~ by Tears for Fears. (Side note: If you're going to put up a TFF song, why go obvious? Put up perhaps one of the greatest pop songs from the decade, ~Head Over Heels?~)   Pac-Man's Arcade Corner has an alternate mode to spice up the shopping experience. You can play a little mini-game called ~Game That Tone!~ where you listen to a few bars of a tone, then try to select the correct title via multiple choice. It's cute and clever, and while it didn't hold my interest for very long, the effort is certainly appreciated.   What isn't appreciated, though, is the navigation of the tone library. Whatta pain. For example, say you dive six pages deep into a category catalog and find a tone you want to preview, after listening to it, backing out sends you all the way to the first page of the catalog. And then you have to move through the pages again to get back to where you were. This proved extremely frustrating after some time, and could really squelch interest in revisiting the service for people not paid to review such services.   And, now, a word about the quality of the ringers. The Namco tones sound great. They are clear as a bell, and sound pretty much exactly like their sources. The pop songs, though, sometimes do not. Getting back to ~Shout,~ for an example -- I understand that without full voice, you have to assign a channel to the vocal track and it won't sound exactly right, but ~Shout~ sounded messy. And to a fan, things like that are extremely noticeable.  As mentioned, Pac-Man's Arcade Corner really is a clever little application in theory, but some of the navigation issues and garbled tones snuff out my excitement. The Namco tones sound good -- and, in all fairness, that's what I came for so in that respect, I was satisfied. I was able to juice my handset with some great Namco tones (now my LG VX8000 sounds like an 80s arcade). But I foresee some frustration for those looking for pop music ringers, and I dont expect many subscribers to spend much time in the ~Game That Tone!~ arena.Oh, and one more thing, who came up with the ~Pac-Man's Hip Hop Theme?~ Goofy.", "date": "Sep 9, 2005"}
