Since most of those methods involve killing large amounts of people and/or dealing in exotic narcotics, I probably shouldn't go into too much detail.  You never know who reads these things.    It's for those of you want the Mercedes driving experience, but don't want the stiff prison sentences and possible eternal damnation that TDK offers up the world's first all-Mercedes racer, World Racing.   Formerly known as Mercedes-Benz World Racing, World Racing does a really great job at being an interactive advertisement for the car maker.  The real question is: Is it a worthwile game?     Yes and no.     Gameplay   World Racing has got to be the first racing game in which most players won't spend much time actually racing.  Virtually all of the game's modest amount of fun is to be had in exploring the vast expanses that lie off the track.  Pretty much anything you see in the background, be it a distant mountain, a far off bridge or whatever, can be reached.  You'll find yourself spending tons of time simply driving around, looking for good cliffs to fling your cars off and admiring the scenery.    Unfortunately, admiring is all you get to do.  With an occasional exception, any object off the track can be driven through.  Trees, cows, people, stealth bombers, none of it's tangible.  Why can't I mow down cows?  Why?!?!?!?!?!     Buildings, on the other hand, are surrounded by an impenetrable force field that prevents you from driving around them, with frustrating results.  For example, in Mexico you can drive past pyramids.  As we all know, pyramids are nature's ramp.  Try driving up one, and you're stopped by an invisible wall the moment you come within a few feet of the bottom.  Disappointing.   Of course, this is supposed to be a racing game, not a driving around and looking at pretty stuff game, and as such there is a racing mode for those who want it.  You go through races and win championships, just like so many other racers out there.  It's just not very fun.   Even in the first championship, the AI racers are gruelingly tough.  Basically, they all take the perfect line every time, and if you want to have a chance to win, you'll have to do the same.  If you so much as graze a rail, you'll fall behind.  Once you fall behind, you're pretty much out of the race.  Add in the fact that races get really really long and you've got a recipe for frustration when, after half an hour of nearly perfect racing, the slightest error can still lose the race.  If you find yourself completely overwhelmed, you can lower the AI's skill level in the options menu, but then where would your self esteem be?   At least you're not required to win each race.  Your finishing place is merely one of six stats that the game tracks your progress with.  Unfortunately, this means you're expected to abide by things like ~fair play,~ which means that you're not allowed to hit other cars or try and push them off the road, and ~Discipline~ which is not going off road and looking for short cuts.  Why somebody at TDK thought that players should be punished for doing the most fun stuff in the game is completely beyond me.   Race physics feel relatively spot on.  All the cars have a real sense of weight, at least until they go airborne, at which point they get a bit floaty.  At the default settings, World Racing is a decidedly simulation-ey game, with a dash of arcade-inspired power sliding.  If this isn't your cup of tea, car handling can be made tighter or looser in the options menu.      While the game boasts over 100 vehicles, that's only kinda sorta true.  There are only 26 different models, many of which have alternate versions with different stats.  Vehicles range from SUVs to sedans to bizarre '50s prototype cars and more, all of which sport the Mercedes logo.  It's imperative that you pick the right car for a race: if you try and use, say, a CLK Coupe on an off-road level, you'll quickly find yourself stuck.  Unlike most games that use licensed cars, World Racing features damage modeling.  Not only can you bang up the outside of your car a little, damage effects vehicle performance.  Once you get your damage up to about 90 percent, you won't be able to do anything but limp around at under 20 miles an hour. While this is definitely a welcome addition to any racing game, it feels half-hearted here.   The problem is that every single vehicle is obscenely tough.   I know that Mercedes cars are supposed to be well-built, but this game would have us believe that they can be launched off a hundred foot cliff into a boulder and receive only five percent damage along with a small dent in the fender.  While I can understand that Mercedes-Benz might not want people to think of their vehicles as flaming death traps, this might be overdoing it.   If there's one thing about World Racing that's just plain awful, it's the menus.  These may be the most unintuitive, confusing menus in the history of menus.        For example, the game has a news function to tell you when you unlock cars or tracks, start a new championship, and so on.  Instead of putting all this information in one menu, it's spread out all over the place.  To find out if you've unlocked a new car, you have to go to the car menu, then to news.  If you want to see if you've gotten a new track, go back to main menu, into the track menu, and check the news there and so on.  Information about car stats is in a different menu than the one from which you pick your car and so on.  It's just crap.    Graphics   The cars of World Racing are, like much of the game, completely average.    They do a decent job of representing their real life counterparts, and they're real shiny and all, but they're a tad on the simplistic side and won't really turn any heads.  Like that fat girl who sits behind you in class, the one place where this game's cars are any good is on the inside.   In the cockpit view, you can use the right analog stick to look around the interior of your car.  This doesn't sound like much, but I guarantee the first thing you'll do when you unlock a new car is to look around the inside.  Each interior is unique, and exploring the differences between models is a thoroughly addicting experience.   While the car models are just so-so, World Racing's environments are a pretty impressive affair, at least when viewed from a distance.  There's no draw-in to speak of, meaning that you can see mountaintops from miles away, hidden only by a faint, realistic blue haze.  Tiny airborne specks in the distance slowly reveal themselves to be relatively detailed balloons, blimps, or even UFOs.  It's all really impressive, and goes a long way towards giving the game its sense of size.   When you get close up to objects, things break down a bit.  Hills seem strangely angular, the game's numerous cows are nothing more than identical, unmoving collections of a few hundred polygons, and the cardboard cutout trees would be at home in a Playstation game.  Much of this is understandable, given the game's size, but it's still a bit of a disappointment.      Sound   From an audio standpoint, World Racing is about as run of the mill as you can get in a racing game.  The engines sound like engines, screeching tires sound like screeching tires, and so on.  It's nothing special, but it gets the job done.  The only real weak point with the sound effects are the crashes.  When I plow into a brick wall at 150 miles per hour, I want to hear plastic crunch and metal snap.  I want to hear the wet sliding of flesh being sliced off of a drivers face as it careens through a windshield.  Instead, all we're given is a single smacking sound that gets louder or softer depending on how hard you hit something.  No fun at all.   The game's music fares a little better.  Comprised mostly of inoffensive techno and rock, it stays in the background and makes a pretty good driving companion.  Some of the tracks feature announcers saying stuff in English and Japanese, which can seem a little out of place when you're blasting through Swiss Alps, but that's just a minor complaint.  Custom soundtrack support is also featured, so you'll probably end up listening to your own stuff most of the time anyway.  As a strict racer, World Racing fails to rise above the pack in a notoriously overcrowded genre.  If you're just looking for a good racing game, there are too many far better titles out there for this one to get a recommendation.  The ability to leave the game's tracks and explore its massive environments, however, gives it a relaxing quality that's surprisingly refreshing.  If the world outside the racetrack were just a little more interactive and the races a tad more interesting, this game could have been a contender.  As it stands, World Racing is probably worth a rental or two at best.", "date": "Mar 27, 2003"}
