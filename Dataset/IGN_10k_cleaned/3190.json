Nintendo, after years of sitting on the much-requested Metroid franchise, finally offers gamers what they crave: a true sequel that not only meets and exceeds the formula established in the three previous games in the series, it also exceeds the standards for what's expected in a handheld experience. Metroid Fusion is an outstanding achievement on the Game Boy Advance. It not only offers one hell of an action adventure design on the handheld hardware, it shows the market just what can be accomplished on the system given the proper time and commitment. FeaturesSeven different areas to explore Dozen hour adventure GameCube link feature with Metroid PrimeCartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy AdvanceMetroid Fusion picks up right after Super Metroid left off. On a routine trip back to planet SR388, Samus is attacked by a never-before-seen lifeform dubbed the X parasite. Unfortunately for our gal, the parasite infects almost all of Samus' vital systems. Near death, Samus is saved by a vaccine that's created from the DNA of the Metroid that she saved in her previous mission. But in the process, her body and familar suit were altered, leaving her in a much weaker state. Even so, she's sent to a research station to investigate, and potentially, eliminate the growing X parasite threat.LoadingPlay  The X parasites will assume the form of other creatures using their DNA, so the station is overrun by familiar, but drastically mutated creatures that are controlled by the X. In her new state and new attire, Samus can now absorb any floating X parasite in the area; these parasites will replenish Samus' energy and weapon stock, just as the random icons did in the previous games. As players move deeper in the game, they'll battle bosses that are also in control by large X parasites. And by defeating these area bosses and absorbing the parasite from within, they'll recover one of the many abilities that Samus lost, from her trademark morphball to enhanced special techniques that are based off of her classic moves.  This will be the only real, potential spoiler that you'll read in this review, but it's important to know since it's the driving force of the entire Metroid Fusion storyline: one parasite, using part of Samus' DNA and previous suit, has assumed the form of the bounty hunter herself. This creature, dubbed SA-X from here on out, is essentially Samus at her prime (no pun intended). Encountering the SA-X in the game is cause for near certain death, because this thing wants you the same way you want the Parasite X: Dead.  The extensive plot in Metroid Fusion is excellent and engaging, even though it eventually takes the form of a familiar science fiction film in its surprises. But where the game really shines is in its overall gameplay. The developers take what's been established in Super Metroid for the SNES, Metroid for the NES, and Metroid II for the Game Boy, and follow that formula for Metroid Fusion's level design. Players will have to learn to use Samus' obtained abilities to open up hidden passages and doorways; certain blocks that can be destroyed cannot be without a certain technique, and  many times that technique is learned deeper in the game. So mental notes will have to be made, because much of the hidden stuff in the research station requires backtracking after scoring a more powerful attack.    And it's the addition of the SA-X that really brings out a lot of ~Oh, crap!~ situations. Watching the Samus clone patrol an area from close proximity is a little stressful, considering that one false step means you're instant toast. Several instances throughout the adventure will put your quick reflexes to the test so as not to get blasted to smithereens by the SA-X clone...and some of the most fun and tense moments in the game are from the Samus/SA-X encounters.LoadingPlay    The developers did an excellent job pulling off a ton of different abilities through the use of the GBA's limited four-button layout. A slight change to the way missiles are fired makes a whole lot of difference in the gameplay; in previous games, players would toggle missiles on and off with a button press. In Metroid Fusion, the switch between blaster and missiles is instantly more intuitive through the use of the R trigger: hold it down for missiles, release for blasters.The only time I found any control troubles was in one of the moves acquired later in the game, making it difficult for precise jumps required to defeat certain enemies. Even with practice, this move couldn't be performed consistently and fluently...a bit annoying especially during the intense battles that are encountered deep in the adventure.If you need help with Metroid Fusion, be sure to check out our complete Metroid Fusion Walkthrough and Guide.  Even though it looks like a Metroid game, the structure within has been altered noticeably. In past games in the series, you were on your own. It was all about exploration; if you get stuck or trapped in an area, there's something you've overlooked. In Metroid Fusion it's a little strange and very un-Metroid to be told exactly where to go and what to do and what to expect...but that's exactly what happens. Throughout the adventure, Samus is in constant contact with her computer that essentially dictates her next moves. This does sort of ruin the whole exploration aspect that's been a Metroid staple three games prior. But on the flipside, without the computer, the game's storyline wouldn't nearly be as deep or absorbing as it is in this game. While it certainly would have made the game longer had this forced game design not been written in, I'm torn because I think the atmosphere benefits from the ~conversations~ between Samus and her computer.Metroid: The Complete PlaylistHere's every Metroid game, in order of release.

Samus herself is drawn with several frames of animation, and the designers didn't cheat, either; every animation has been drawn twice to ensure that her blaster is always on her right arm. The developers pull off believable lighting, water, and heat effects using transparent layers, and the X parasites seem to breathe life from the programmers' use of the GBA's sprite scaling abilities. A lot of effects are so subtle and effectively used that it won't pull players out of their gaming experience; ~Ooh, neat!~ moments are few and far between, only because the entire game's graphics are pulled off so successfully.  And the audio compliments the entire game extremely well. The Game Boy Advance isn't exactly known for its sound capabilities, but several developers have pulled off some great audio on the handheld. But none so effectively as Metroid Fusion The musical score is understated but appropriately so, and it definitely fits the mood of the adventure. The sound effects are well-rendered and keep with the style that was established in Super NES' Super Metroid. I highly suggest you take advantage of the special ~headphone~ feature of the audio options, because the game's stereo effects are sweet candy for the ears.      On the GameCube, Retro Studios went all out for Samus' first 3D adventure. On the Game Boy Advance, Intelligent Systems went all out for Samus' latest 2D adventure. If you're a Metroid fan, this is a win/win situation for all. Metroid Fusion is a brilliant continuation of the 2D series, pulling most of the successful ideas from the previous adventures while adding new elements unique to this game's design. Don't be fooled by the in-game clock; even though the adventure may last an average of five hours through, the seconds don't tick away during any of the several cutscenes in the game, nor does it count the time wasted dying and restarting from a save point. In reality, it will take a good 10 to 12 hours of hard playtime to go from beginning to end of Metroid Fusion, and it's an incredibly satisfying experience all the way through. And like the previous games in the series, Metroid Fusion features an incredibly well-structured design that a second play through to beat the previously acquired time.If there's anything to bitch about in this fantastic game, I'm a little disappointed in the fact that the Game Boy Advance gamers don't really benefit from the link between Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime; the two treats that the connection offers only affects the GameCube version of the game.Beyond that, it's hard to point at anything in Metroid Fusion that could be considered ~bad.~ Intelligent Systems put together a fantastic adventure on the Game Boy Advance that not only will please those Samus fanatics that were itching for a continuation of her 2D adventures, it will most likely generate interest in gamers unfamiliar with the series to seek out Samus' previous games.
