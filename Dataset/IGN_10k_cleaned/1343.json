{"name": "Rollcage Stage II", "name_review": "Rollcage Stage 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/17/rollcage-stage-2", "text": "Although Psygnosis barely bothered to create the  pretense that this series was anything besides a side project based on its chief moneymaker, the original title was well received by critics and fans  alike.  Fast forward a few years and you'll find that while the British  publisher may have gone the way of the dodo, its legacy thankfully lives on  in one of the finest four-wheeled balls to the wall arcade racers of all  time.   Gameplay Fast n' furious, that's the only way this title dishes punishment out.   Players hop behind the wheel of a futuristic vehicle and gun it for the  finish line.  Whomever gets killed in between the starting flag and photo  finish, well, that's up to you.  Yet while Rollcage's ideology dates back to  the prehistoric days, it does take the concept of driving up and down walls  to new heights.  In fact, because your futuristic buggy operates regardless  of which side is up, it's possible to pull all sorts of crazy stunts and  still land with nary a hitch on all four tires.  Street scholars know that there are two kinds of innovation: a. original  ideas and b. old principles refined and expanded upon.  Rollcage: Stage II's  contributions to the genre fall strictly into the latter categroy.   Regardless of whichever of the umpteen gazillion play modes one leans  towards (Campaign, Arcade, Time Attack, etc.), an excessive amount of replay  value is guaranteed.  Wherever you turn, there's something new to see and  do, whether it involves unlocking new cars and tracks in solo competitions,  testing a friend's skill at split-screen multiplayer, or tearing out hair in  the elegantly simple challenge based Scramble levels.  Quantity's no substitute for quality, however.  Regardless, this product  has nothing to worry about in the fun department.  Tight handling and cars  of varying strengths rated on power, acceleration, top speed, grip and  strength make for an insane ride.  Vehicles reach speeds of over 400MPH,  with frame rates to match.  Put those bad boys on winding, curvaceous tracks  that throw pitfalls, obstacles and super speed arrows their way and it's a  surefire recipe for death on wheels.  Rejoice, for those who buy into the  hype will be rewarded with many a white-knuckle play session.  And yet there's no guaranteed formula for victory.  Because triple  missiles, shields, turbo boosts, electric prods, and other manly instruments  of torture litter the ground, every race's outcome defies prediction.   Jaunts on the walls or ceiling can be fun, but they're tricky to pull of and  throw even the most masterful driver's game off.  And, wouldn't you know it,  this kind of trouble leads to wrong turns and occurs just frequently enough  to jeopardize the strongest lead.  Competitors enjoy running each other off  of the road.  Tracks become downright vicious in adverse weather conditions.    To make a long story short, each game is more challenging than a crash  course in quantum physics, and thus a new adventure unto itself.  This then isn't an expansion on the death race paradigm, just the foremost  evolution ever to hit the PlayStation roadways.  An unbelievably cool sense  of style blends with a superb driving model and one of the most robust  upgrade systems in existence to create an almost classic product that's as  rich as it is awesome to play.  Yes, everyone's been here and done that  before a la Wipeout, Killer Loop, and Speed Punks (amongst others), but  nobody's witnessed the same ol' shtick being pulled off so well.  Were  Sony's lil' grey box to kick off without further ado, Rollcage: Stage 2  would be a fitting swan song for the machine's pedal to the metal lineup.  Graphics Aesthetically, the product's not spectacular.  Mind you, it's no frickin'  eyesore either.  Menus have an upbeat, classy style to their decor, while  car models look like rough n' tumble roadsters put together for speed's  sake.  Despite the average quality resolution in which these objects and  screen are presented, both they and the tracks make a concerted effort to  live in harmony with their limitations.  Light trails and explosions could  use some enhancement, as they're about as basic as these effects come,  though the title's weaknesses are made up for with a blistering frame rate.   From barren canyon runs under an angry, red sky to high-velocity streaks  across corkscrewing courses in the midst of a torrential downpour, the  visuals do not disappoint.  Sound Ah yes, how sweet it is for your ears to be caressed by the pumping beats  of techno tunes. An all-star soundtrack featuring flamboyantly hip cuts from the EZ Rollers, Omni Trio, Flytronix and Dom & Roland (to name a few)  certainly adds to the enjoyment factor.  Spot on sound effects were also  used for tire screeches, weapon blasts, powerslides, and the grinding of  metal upon metal.  Splendidly high production values echo throughout the  aural presentation in its entirety.  Frankly, you should be tempted to  listen to these tunes even when the game's not powered up.As mentioned, Rollcage: Stage 2 breaks barely little new ground, if any.  But who gives a crap?  It reproduces everything you've come to love and adore from arcade racers with a Midas touch.  By straining against the very boundaries imposed upon the long established fictional racing niche, Psygnosis and developer Attention to Detail have pulled off a minor miracle. It'd be nothing short of scandalous for grease monkeys to avoid adding this must-have title to their collection.", "date": "Oct 17, 2000"}
