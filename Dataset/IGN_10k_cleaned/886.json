Three of my good friends and I would run out to the grocery store, buy two cases of Mountain Dew, a good three pounds of bulk-food Sour Patch Kids, and circle around the PC for a 13-hour marathon session of multiplayer Heroes. These sessions would penetrate deep into the night, and anyone unlucky enough to doze off into sleep between turns would receive a vicious pillow beating. The fate of those leaving for home early because they lacked the stamina to complete a night's festivities were disciplined even more vigorously. All in all, they were the best times a bunch of gamers could ask for.    Heroes of Might and Magic III: Restoration of Erathia was a brilliantly addictive, well-designed masterpiece of a turn-based strategy title. The expansion pack, Armageddon's Blade, was primarily well received by both gaming critics and the public. So, where does that put Heroes III: the Shadow of Death? 3DO went against the logical progression of releasing the game, releasing an expansion pack, and then releasing a bundle containing the original game and the expansion pack. Instead, they created a huge set of new scenarios, campaigns, neutral creatures, and other neat features. Plus they decided to bundle that with the original Heroes III instead of including Armageddon's Blade. So, Heroes III: the Shadow of Death contains the entirety of the original Heroes III: Restoration of Erathia and adds a slew of new features you won't find in Armageddon's Blade. The result is both a perfect introductory game for Heroes newcomers to experience the series with and a title that even veterans who own both Restoration of Erathia and Armageddon's Blade will want to buy for the sheer amount of extra playing time it brings. To make matters even better, Heroes III: the Shadow of Death is fully compatible with Armageddon's Blade, which combine to make one gigantic Heroes game.    A majority of the changes and fixes in the gameplay appear to reflect requests from the gaming community. By far the greatest and most influential change in gameplay is the addition of powerful combination artifacts. If a hero can gather all of the artifacts in a specific series, they join together to create a powerful combination artifact. There are 12 combination artifacts, each comprising of three to nine different artifacts, and each with the potential to greatly strengthen the possessor. The effects of these combination artifacts range from item to item. Although unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately -- for the sake of play balance), actually gathering together all of the artifacts required for a combination artifact is exceedingly difficult and happens very rarely. Collecting all of the items required to create the more powerful of the combination artifacts, up to nine pieces for some, appears to be just about impossible.    As for the other subtle changes, most players new to Heroes III probably won't notice them, but serious followers will be delighted with the updated play mechanics. For example, units now take damage from castle moats (the amount of damage varies between town types), and there is now a choice of hiring either original or upgraded units when you possess an upgraded creature structure.    There aren't any new creatures available in any of the original town types, but the new neutral units are absolutely brilliant. In total, there are 23 new creatures available to recruit in outside living areas. The new units include a number of new dragon types, such as Azure and Rust dragons, and Sharpshooters, deadly looking Elven archers with increased damage and no range penalty. Also of interest, players can guard mines with creatures, and heroes with the artillery skill can now control the fire of arrow towers in castles.    I've long felt that the multiplayer in HOMM III has been exceptionally well balanced, but in Shadow of Death, it is evident that the game has been even more fine-tuned. The unit cost and stats for a number of creatures have been tweaked to better smooth out any imbalances. All of the new units are also perfectly balanced, and add a lot of added heat to the games as players will want to rush to get the more powerful neutral creatures on their side. The hotseat feature, where players all play a multiplayer game on the same machine and take turns, is still a great choice for gamers looking to practice the finer points of trash-talk etiquette.    The amount of game time potential here is staggering. While the original, Heroes of Might and Magic III: Restoration of Erathia, contained a huge variety of single player map, multiplayer maps, and campaign levels, the Shadow of Death add-on nearly doubles the amount of quality gaming hours. In addition to the 7 campaigns and 40 scenarios found in Heroes III, Shadow of Death adds seven more new campaigns and 38 new scenarios. This combines to create a mind-numbing amount of gaming hours, and would take a positively absurd amount of time to complete entirely. On top of this, Shadow of Death also comes with a new campaign editor as well as the regular mission editor. To put it simply, if you run out of things to do with Shadow of Death, you should think about getting into addiction rehab.   For players new to the series or for more casual Heroes fans, the graphics will appear to have changed little. This is primarily true, as a huge majority of the game's visuals remain exactly the same. However, there are a number of minor tweaks that will excite the more hardcore crowd. There are seven new terrain types, which influence the levels both graphically and strategically, including Magic Plains, Cursed Grounds, and Clover Field. The 23 new neutral units are all attractively designed, and are quite interesting to play around with. Overall, the graphics are in need of an overhaul, but once deeply involved in a scenario or campaign, this is easily ignored. Besides, the Heroes of Might and Magic series was never intended to be on the bleeding-edge of graphics, and it's one of the few series I personally hope never takes the jump to a 3D rendered environment. As for the sound, again, it's essentially the same as Heroes III. Even the new units seem to primarily use the same sound effects as the other units.   Although they are somewhat limited, I would like to address a few complaints. When I received Shadow of Death I was really hoping that they had included the new Elemental Conflux town, and they didn't. To the credit of the designers, after playing through Heroes III again, I was so addicted that I was ready to run out and pick up a copy of Armageddon's Blade just for the Conflux. Although it was a forgivable decision on the part of 3DO to protect sales of the Armageddon's Blade expansion pack, I was disappointed to see that Heroes III: the Shadow of Death does not contain the Elemental Conflux town type. However, many of the units from the Elemental Conflux town are introduced throughout the new maps as neutral creatures.   First and foremost, Shadow of Death is best for players new to Heroes III who do not own Restoration of Erathia  this is primarily because Shadow of Death contains all of Restoration of Erathia in addition to the new features. Although, Shadow of Death does include a $10 rebate for players who already own Restoration of Erathia and Heroes Millennium Edition, and with that in mind, fans of Heroes III really should think about picking it up.   The game is, of course, fundamentally the same. If you played Heroes of Might and Magic III and didn't like it, then save your chits - Shadow of Death isn't for you. If you like strategy titles, and if you are even remotely interested in fantasy themes and haven't yet played a Heroes game, then there's no absolutely reason why you shouldn't go out and pick up Heroes of Might and Magic III: the Shadow of Death. It's a perfect place for players to enter the legendary series, and for diehard Heroes fans, it will be a near religious experience as you rediscover the genius of Heroes of Might and Magic.   -- Erik Peterson", "date": "Apr 21, 2000"}
