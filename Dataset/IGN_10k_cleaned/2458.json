And while I'll allow that those games had clear advantages in certain areas, the PC version of Starfighter seems very much like an uninspired clone of the two preceding console versions. Some of the ported material works as good here as it did on the consoles. The great use of the license and the excellent audio work are two great strengths. But the simplified controls and slim gameplay offerings keep the title from attaining the success we all thought it ought to have.  LucasArts has had a lot of success in their games by focusing on material peripheral to the stories of the films. Starfighter handles that same approach quite well. The events in Starfighter lead up to the eventual Trade Federation blockade that opens the film. In a neat twist, the player jumps back and forth among three different characters in the course of the campaign: Rhys Davies in the speedy N-1 Starfighter, Vana Sage in the agile Guardian and Nym in the sturdy Havoc.  The story itself is quite engaging and really captures the flavor of the Star Wars license perfectly. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that you gradually get more and more involved in more intense action. While you'll venture from the depths of asteroid fields in deep space to rocky canyons on the surface of the planet, there's not much variety in the missions. They range from blowing things up to blowing things up while not letting other thing get blown up. A few racing objectives have been included but these don't add much variety to the standard model.  The missions that take place on the surface of the various planets in the game are far too cramped, especially considering the speed and agility of the three player ships. The cramped sensation comes from the narrow confines in which you're normally fighting. You'd think some other type of ship would be used in situations where you have to negotiate narrow canyons and valleys, but apparently the ass-fast Naboo Starfighter is all you're getting. There's also an invisible ceiling in many of the planet levels that keeps you from using speed to your advantage.  The missions are fairly linear with straightforward objectives that will (usually) be completed in a pretty strict order. There's no reason to stray far from your main objective and, while this is as it should be in real fights, it tends to give the game a slightly controlled feel. The enemies you'll encounter will provide a real challenge from time to time, but you'll progress from one task to another with little need for tactical sophistication.   Once you're done with the 14 missions of the campaign (which shouldn't take more than a few hours honestly, there's still incentive to go back and play some more. Each mission comes with bonus objectives that, when completed, unlock special bonus missions. These are pretty fun and more varied than the campaign missions. You can also open up a special new ship (from the film) that almost everyone has already spoiled in the other reviews but I'll leave for you to discover yourself. What I won't let you discover yourself is that the game has no multiplayer of any kind. Huh? The PS2 and Xbox versions have multiplayer but the PC doesn't? Pardon me, but that seems really shallow.  Sadly, given the ported-nature of the game, there are lots of things missing from the interface also. I decided long before I wrote this review that I simply couldn't compare this game to the previous LucasArts space games on the PC. But while I won't criticize the game for not being TIE Fighter it still lacks many of the features that made the older game more convenient. First off, the targeting controls are far too limited. You can either cycle through a list of enemy targets or target the object directly in front of you. This means you have to search for the main objectives among the other objects in the environment. You can't bind targets either to help you find them again later. And while we're on the subject, the HUD could really have used a radar screen so you could quickly orient yourself to the rest of the ships. Since so many bonus objectives require you complete tasks within a specified time, I'm really at a loss as to why there's no clock in the HUD.  I liked the flight model for its relaxed, intuitive physics. Direction and speed controls are quite responsive. In keeping with the complaints of the previous paragraph, a ~match speed~ key would be quite welcome here. You can get a pretty useful fishtail turn down by accelerating and then quickly braking as you turn that seems a fairly arcade-oriented approach but it fits perfectly with the cinematic flavor of the game. Collisions are somewhat forgiving in terms of damage but tend to immediately snap your ship in a new direction.  But while the flight model is good, the control scheme keeps you from appreciating it. Being a fan of both atmospheric and space simulations, I tend to be really particular about my control scheme. You can tell right away when setting up the controller that too little attention was paid to adapting the game controls for the wealth of peripherals available for the PC. To LucasArts' credit, there are a number of preset control configurations for some of the more popular joysticks. My problem is that I still prefer to use the Y-axis for roll and the rudder for yaw.  The control configuration seems to constantly read the signal from the throttle of the joysticks I tried so anytime I tried to remap a directional control, it assumed I wanted to use the throttle stick. Eventually I got it to work with the Saitek X36 I use at home (through sheer persistence, I suppose), but the throttle slider on the Sidewinder Precision Pro continuously overwrote the inputs for the other directional controls. The readme suggests I set the throttle to zero before assigning new controls, but that didn't work either.  Graphically, Starfighter is a mixed bag. The weapon effects and explosions are quite good and most of the environmental textures are really convincing. The ship textures really don't seem to have enough detail on them, but the models themselves are well designed and suitably Star Warsey. The pre-rendered backgrounds in the outer space and planetary levels are some of the best we've seen. Some truly spectacular cutscenes drive the story and are much more focused on the characters than the ships.  As good as the cutscenes are from a graphical and narrative standpoint, credit has to be given to the voice acting for making it all come alive. The voice actors are superb and their talents not only make the cutscenes come to life, but also help to immerse you in the game during the missions. There's lots of chatter (and some downright crucial info) coming at you over the communicator. As you might expect, the adaptation (or straight appropriation) of John Williams' score keeps the action high. Most of the tracks are straight from the film (or at least remixes) and it works beautifully. The whining engines and the screaming lasers fit perfectly with the game.   I can't really recommend the game with too much enthusiasm. It's fun enough, I suppose, but it feels more like an uninspired port. There haven't been many titles in this genre recently (and fewer still using this license) so if you're more interested in the flavor of the game rather than the play mechanics, you'll probably be satisfied. If, like me, you prefer a great game to a great use of a license, then you'd be better off saving your time and money.  -- Steve Butts     Want to share your opinions with the world?
