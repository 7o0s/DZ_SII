{"name": "Gladius", "name_review": "Gladius", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/30/gladius", "text": "Slaves, criminals, and foreigners were forced to fight for their lives on the hard packed dirt of an arena. Throngs of commoners and aristocrats perched on the edge of the tiered seating, staring down at the combatants. With each drop of blood that spilled onto the earth, the throng's clamor rose. While not directly impacting the skill of a gladiator, their support, or lack thereof, can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Sometimes, the arenas held beasts, hidden obstacles, or naval battles. The odds might be horribly stacked against a fighter if the manger was trying to recreate a historic battle or mythical event. Despite the variations in an arena's theme or the mood of the crowd -- gladiators ultimately lived or died by the Gladius.   Most likely the first thing that pops into your mind is Ridley Scott's film Gladiator. While an accurate picture of the ancient world, if a somewhat romanticized view of a gladiator's life, Gladiator succeeded in capturing the intensity of arena combat -- severed limbs, blood stained sand, and hectic, fast-paced battles. However, Gladius isn't connected to Gladiator, and it doesn't feature the hack and slash style gameplay you'd associate with a gladiator game. Instead, Lucas Arts has developed a gladiator based strategy RPG -- an odd choice, both for the subject matter and the collective audience.  Does Gladius have what it takes to survive in the RPG arena?   Gameplay  Gladius takes place in a world recovering from a horrible war. The two nations, Imperia and Nordagh, have nearly destroyed themselves. The two states agree to end waged combat and to resolve all conflict in the gladiatorial arena. Gladius unfolds from the perspective of two characters as they struggle to build a school worthy of fighting in the Imperia arena.    Besides for slightly different difficulty levels and a different take on the same story, the two campaigns, while worth playing through, are fairly similar. One stars the Imperia citizen, Valens, whose recently murdered father was a great gladiator. Left in charge of the school, Valens must fight to make a reputation for himself rather than live in his father's shadow. The other is a barbarian princess, Ursula, who wants to join the gladiatorial circuit so that she can see the world -- while discovering that she possesses mystical powers.   However, like most strategy games, Gladius doesn't spend a lot of time on the story. Sporadic cut scenes outline spartan information about a heroes' character as well as some background information on arenas. A lot of it is relatively pointless, since it has little impact on the main story and simply tells you that a certain character is nervous about battle X or to watch out for a certain enemy type. Cut scenes that actually advance the storyline are few and far between. However, in each arena, league, and tournament, you can read up on bits of history, which allows you to piece together regional rivalries and the background story of Gladius' world if you're interested -- if not, you can stick to fighting.   Fight you will. It's really what Gladius is all about. In each town, you'll have to win a designated amount of league battles to qualify for the tournament, while winning all the tournaments qualifies for regionals -- which eventually gets you to Imperia. If you tire of the same old progress through arena gameplay, you'll have opportunities to accept side quests from officials (like eliminating a roving band of witches). However, they serve little purpose beyond unlocking some hidden leagues and offering a change of scenery.   While continual arena battles get monotonous, each match has a certain set of entry requirements, such as a mixture of males and females, gladiator classes, skill levels, or popularity. This forces you to, at some point, use all the gladiators in your arsenal instead of relying on your most powerful. If you can't meet these demands, you can try recruiting a gladiator or move onto another settlement.   Besides for straight up, slaughter thy enemy, combat, there are a couple variations from the age old deathmatch. Other match styles include king of the hill, dominance (three hot spots you want to control), destroy the other team's monument (sort of like capture the flag), points battle (see who can inflict the most damage in a time limit), and destroy more barrels than the opposition match.   Different tactics need to be applied for each match type, which primarily involves character selection. Also, while you can place troops rather haphazardly in deathmatches, to gain the upper hand in events like king of the hill, you really have to study your opponents and their positions on the field.    Combat isn't what you'd expect and it's where you'll find the real genius of Gladius. Although it's a turned based RPG, the combat system is a lot more interactive than traditional strategy games like Tactics Ogres or Final Fantasy Tactics. Your movement is still limited to a certain radius, you can't queue orders, you can only target enemies within a certain range, and powerful attacks blows require points to use, but the combat doesn't feel rigid. Your gladiators are able to move during their idle phase -- up to an extra turn's worth of movement, which makes the game less static. This also expands your tactical options because you can move your gladiator farther distances, but you risk missing an opportunity to strike if your target moves in a different direction.   It's not just a game of who can out maneuver whom. Depth is added by several advantage effects. The three different gladiator classes, light, medium, and heavy, share a classic 'rock, paper, scissors' relationship. Medium warriors are more likely to punish light gladiators, heavy can crush medium, and the light guys can topple the hefty ones. While you aren't guaranteed to win if you follow this formula, your attacks cause more damage.   Other tricks, like facing and ground height, affect your gladiator's performance. If you manage to hit a gladiator in the back, you'll deal more damage. If you're on an elevated object like a rock or box, you'll have an advantage over those below you. While these mechanics seem simple, they add a lot tactically to Gladius -- even if it is somewhat silly to climb on top of a box in the midst of battle.    While you'll spend a lot of time figuring out who to attack and where to stand, figuring out how to attack is equally important. Fortunately, a thorough tutorial mode walks you through your first couple battles. It teaches you the ropes, which if it wasn't there, you probably wouldn't stick around to learn.   All of your gladiators can learn new skills as they gain experience. Your basic attack is free of charge, but more complex moves require you to spend combat points -- such as combos, powerful kicks, the ability to morph into beasts, and power ups. Your gladiator is awarded combat points at the end of each turn. This intuitive points system, similar to spell casting mana requirements, prevents you from relying solely on your powerful attacks as well as teaches budgeting skills.   Affinity powers are similar to skills that require combat points. Your gladiator has to charge up enough elemental affinities by attacking with an affinity equipped weapon. Each time you successfully land a hit, it will fill a portion of your affinity meter, which then can be used to perform an affinity move. This system successfully rewards players who properly outfit their gladiators and plan out their attacks for maximum affinity charge.   A lot of the combat system can be found in other RPGs, but what distinguishes Gladius is the swing meter. While it's certainly gimmicky, the swing meter serves a number of purposes -- you have direct control over the amount of damage you do, it makes combat more exciting, if you don't pay attention, you'll die, and it's just different.   Most of the attacks require one of four button pressing feats. Each meter, regardless of type, is divided into normal, critical, and miss categories. You want the cursor to stop in the critical zone, which deals the most damage. If you wait too long to strike, your swing will be a weak hit or a complete miss. Basic attacks use a simple swing meter (similar to those in golf games). Combos are composed of several consecutive, narrower swing meters. Ranged attacks need you to quickly match button presses with those displayed onscreen. The annoying button masher meter, luckily, rarely shows up.   Your school will also have to contend with the crowd's approval rating. Your popularity directly affects your gladiators' performance. You'll win their favor by using tactical tricks, scoring critical hits, and of course killing enemies. There are four levels of crowd favor. At each level, your gladiators will receive a bonus such as stronger attack power, defensive boost, or more frequent turns. However, the crowd is extremely fickle. Your rating can skyrocket and then plummet in the space of a turn -- even if you're clearly dominating. For some reason it scores you by a tactical aspect, but your opponent is often able to steal you approval by simply landing a hit.    Gladius has a lot to offer, but as with every ambitious project it has its problems. One of the more annoying traits is lengthy load times between combat, menu, and world map screens. They're so frequent and long that they noticeably break up the gameplay. If the game is loading during a battle, the swing meter cursor will stutter across the screen, which really affects your performance.   The AI, at times, is just stupid and unbalanced. During one destroy the barrel race, the last barrel was parked right next to the AI, while my gladiators were on the other side of the screen. The AI could have easily destroyed the barrel before I got within striking distance, but it chose to morph between human and bear forms (costs a turn) allowing me to win. In numerous monument matches, the enemy will rush everyone at your monument, leaving their totem wide open for attack. Use all but one gladiator for defense and you win. Points battles are simply unbalanced. Several final scores consist of the AI teams scoring 62, 30, and 0, while my team scored 300.   This isn't to say that there is no challenge to Gladius. Once you get past the twenty hour mark, even with supped up warriors, you'll have to diligently strategize each move in order to win -- but for the first leg of your adventure there isn't a huge fear of defeat.   Even if you lose, there isn't any penalty for failure -- unless it takes place outside of an arena. While traveling the world map, you might have a random encounter, but you can play for ten hours without being threatened (and it's not as though you don't spend any time on the world map -- especially since it isn't user friendly). As long as injuries are in arenas, you're safe (in the world you die).   Even the most backward provinces, have excellent physicians on staff to revive your slain warriors. It's also rare that you won't beat a match on your second try, unless your gladiators aren't as experienced as the competition. The matches aren't random. Boxes, hot spots, and monuments are always in the same spot for a specific match, which gives you an unfair advantage if you've seen the map before.    If the AI isn't offering enough challenge, you can always test your skills against human players. Up to four players can battle it out in an exhibition mode that lets you choose from any region, arena, gladiator, and battle mode you've encountered in your travels. The actual gameplay is identical to what you'd encounter in the campaign, except that you might be forced to think a bit more than when facing the AI.   Graphics  Gladius might not be the most visually stunning game on the market, but occasionally the artwork surprises you. The first thing you'll notice is the opening cut scene. The camera slowly pans over still artwork that occasionally has an animated effect (like billowing flames or lightening). While it seems simplistic, it reflects (whether intentional or not) the Greek and Roman friezes that depict significant events in stone relief. Also, the artwork itself is really well done -- a very classical representation of the events, both in the style and presentation (they're scattered throughout the game).   Fully animated cut scenes depict longer, more significant banter, between primary characters. Some items look great, highly detailed articles of clothing and weapons, while other things, like lesser accessories and hair look particularly bland and static. An interesting effect is that the foreground appears in traditional game graphics -- while the background shares the opening scene's storyboard look. Facial animations are simply amazing. Not content with accurate lip synching, you'll also see some eerily realistic eyeball movement. Eyeballs shift side to side, widen, and narrow -- light will even gleam off the whites.   The arena action, which includes in game cut scenes, maintains the same artistic look of the animated (not storyboard) cut scenes, without retaining any of the detail. While backgrounds have objects like boxes, tree stumps and bones, the textures look stretched and muddled. Character models also suffer.    Hands and feet are blocky and claw looking, and clothes and skin textures aren't clearly defined -- a lot of tunics look painted on rather than worn. While the characters have a number of animations for both idle, movement, and combat states, you won't see as much detail (as is expected) as you do in the cut scenes.   Traveling around the world, which compared to arena combat is fairly infrequent, occurs from an almost overhead angle. Objects are over exaggerated and sloppily represented. You will find a few lone citizens wandering around the countryside, water spilling over rocks, and numerous towns set into hillsides -- but the style clashes with the rest of the game instead of complementing it.   Finally, the town menu screens are very bland. A lot of times conversations take place in plain text boxes where the speaker is only represented by a low resolution head shot.   As you progress through the layers of the game, graphics slide from decent to worse. The storyboards look great, if somewhat unconventional, the animated cut scenes also look good -- but as soon as you move into actual gameplay realms the production value drops dramatically.    Sound  The musical score carries the proper weight -- sometimes it's just background noise while at other points it crescendos at the appropriate places, adding emphasis where needed in battle or spurring you into action. Also, each region has its own musical style, which helps create distinct regional personalities. The fault lies in that the tracks in each region are too few. While themes change between menus, world map, and battles, you spend the most time in the arena and there's only one continuously looped song to listen to. It isn't too annoying, but it is noticeable.   Sound effects range from the guttural cries of barbarians, to the growls of wild men and clang of weapons. There's a pretty good spread of effects. However, you'll have heard all the grunts and shrieks long before you complete a single region (let alone surviving through both campaigns). Voice acting is respectable, but occasionally the acting sounds forced in emotional scenes.Despite problems like repeated AI stupidity, Gladius is fun and offers a different take on strategy RPGs. This isn't a game you can just pick up off the store shelf and play. It takes some time to really figure out what it's about and explore all that you can do. A wide range of attack options, character customizations, tactics, and battle requirements put fresh faces on what would otherwise be a repetitive match structure. Most importantly, the swing meter is just enough action to stave off the usual turn-based boredom.If you only play Gladius for a short period of time, you'll walk away fairly unimpressed. It's not visually striking and the storyline doesn't play a prominent enough role to really get your attention, but if you're willing to invest the hour or so it takes to really get into the game, you'll be surprised at just how much fun Gladius can be. I've spent several nights playing until 4 a.m., even though my gladiators get slaughtered because I can't keep my eyes open long enough to time the swing meter, because I don't want to put it down.Gladius doesn't try to be a Japanese RPG or a straight out tactics game. It's plucked elements from several strategy games and patched them together into something that feels fresh. Definitely not a game for everyone (or gamers that don't have free time), Gladius fills a rather gaping tactical void on consoles. Give it a chance -- you might just be surprised by how addictive turn-based battles can be.", "date": "Oct 30, 2003"}
