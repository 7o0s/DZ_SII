The game attempted validity through overly complicated diagrams and managed to make us feel dumber than we already are. Almost a year has passed and it seems SEGA is at it again, with a less intimidating approach to the brain training genre. It's not a brain challenge, or a brain boost, just a Brain Assist.   Brain Assist is hosted by four related female researchers. Now normally we'd be pretty thrilled if four nurse sisters between the ages of 25 and 31 were extremely interested in keeping us relaxed. However, their nearly identical faces and unnerving smirks leave us a smidge creeped out. Plus, they just pale in comparison to Eva, the evil nurse that likes things hard. She pops up occasionally to kick the training up a few notches.   Graphics are not the focus of the title, which is par for the course in brain games. Still, Brain Assist has a decent style and some cute characters. The music is upbeat and lively, and the screens glow with bright colors.   The training is 10 minigames and two evaluation tests. Unlike most games in the genre, Brain Assist doesn't attempt to measure facets of the player's brain. There is a letter grade after the evaluation tests, but the game never relates this to a level of intelligence. Whether it was conscious or not, the developers managed to remove a level of pretention by not proclaiming their product can accurately measure brain function or measurably improve it.   Most of the game test memory. Good thing we never had to remember which sister was which. Since Brain Assist is more right brain focused, a lot of the minigames normally found in these titles are missing. There isn't a simple math game, for instance. Instead, any use of numbers is used only as a means for memory or recognition games. Most of the games have a focus on shapes and colors, and the entire presentation is vibrant throughout. Everything is easy to see and read, even in games like Character Match where dozens of symbols appear on the screen.   But why should gamers snatch up this title if they already have a brain game? Well honestly, they probably shouldn't. Brain Assist is even more casual than something like Brain Age, since it doesn't present itself like homework.    And while the genre isn't redefined, or even reinvigorated by Brain Assist, the game does offer a couple new things. As mentioned earlier, there is an evil (and dare we say more alluring?) nurse that appears from time to time. If the player is doing well in the training mode, she'll kick the difficulty up.    It works because the point of all the games is to see how far the player can get before making three or so mistakes. The game recognizes when a player is doing perfectly and when they're just doing alright, or not well, and balances the difficulty progression to match. Thus we found ourselves being challenged each time we played the game, without having to play the minigame for longer stretches just to get to the harder stages.   Another new feature to the handheld brain market is Brain Assist's Compatibility Mode. With a single game card two players can play a cooperative evaluation test. The test is somewhat customizable. Gameplay varies from having both players play the game separately and averaging the score or having the players compete in the same game simultaneously. For Count-Mania, one player tapped even numbers, the other odd, and alternated control. It's not a major selling point for the title, but it's a lot more fun than just sending someone a math or Sudoku demo.Brain Assist is a decent take on the genre, and while it doesn't stand out as a major accomplishment, it is just different enough to make it fun. If there were more minigames to choose from then we might be able to recommend this title. The 10 offered are fun abstract takes that serve as neat distractions, but, unless you have a thing for identical doctor sisters and succubae, pass.", "date": "Feb 29, 2008"}
