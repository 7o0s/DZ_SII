Turbine did an excellent job building hype among its player base for this expansion, so much so that it thrust the game into the #1 best selling spot for the week it was released.  Though a few problems presented itself initially, Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty has lived up to its hype and is a wonderful addition to the game.    For those new to Dereth, Asheron's Call has a pretty simple premise.  Asheron, a great wizard, opened portals and let in some very ferocious monsters, which promptly proceeded to take the land of Dereth over.  Asheron opened new portals to a safe place that his people escaped to, but he stayed behind to combat the evil he let in.  In addition to staying, though, he opened new portals that led from Ispar to Dereth, where the Heroes in Asheron's Call are from.  These portals are one way, and brave heroes from Ispar heeded the call of Asheron and came to fight for the land of Dereth.  Turbine recently updated the starting templates to more closely mirror starting statistics that players have optimized, so that newcomers to the game won't necessarily have to restart after playing 20 levels with a character that is less than strong (had they taken a stock template prior to this update).  New players can choose one of these templates or customize a character to their liking.  One thing I have always loved about Asheron's Call is the character customization.  All the characters that can be chosen are human in appearance, but with choices of skin color, hair color, eye color and a great many faces (you choose eyes, nose and mouth separately), characters are individual in appearance.  The storyline has been continually changing over the last two years that Asheron's Call has been live.  That is the greatest thing about this game.  Just when it starts to get a bit stale, new content is added.  Patch day, as it is called, is highly anticipated and exciting, as players scour the landscape hoping to be the first to discover some new object or quest.  With Dark Majesty, the feeling was the same, but on a grander scale, because the landmass to explore was huge.  In addition, the one thing that almost every person playing AC wanted, housing, was finally added.  Marae Lassel, the new landmass added in the expansion, is an island with a large number of quests and dungeons to explore.  Quests and outdoor hunting are available for all levels.  One thing that is pretty much guaranteed on Marae Lassel is death.  The number of times I found myself returning to the lifestone is too numerous to count.  The developers did not make it easy for players to recover their corpses from Marae Lassel.  There are no lifestones or tieable portals on Marae, and the only way to return to the island is through the portals in various towns throughout Dereth.  In the past, this has dissuaded many players from hunting in places that are not easy to travel to.  Linvak Tukal, a Lugian fortress that is quite a run from any town and no tieable portals available nearby is just one example.  Although the hunting in Linvak Tukal is quite nice, it is not a popular hunting spot because it is not easy to get to.   However, Marae Lassel must hold a spell over many players, as no matter how many deaths are accrued, players find themselves returning to the island for more abuse.  Marae Lassel has a few new creatures.  There is the Canescent Mattekar, which drops a new robe with great statistics that became one of the most widely sought after items before this month's patch.  There are variations on other existing monsters, like the Tumeroks, but also some completely new ones as well.  Siraluun look like peacocks and can hit pretty hard.  Carenzi are adorable little puppy-like monsters that make a yelping noise when killed and the higher level one, the Rabid Carenzi, drops relatively good loot.  In addition to monsters, there are plenty of quests on Marae.  The expansion marks the beginning of the newest storyline, with the Olthoi once again attempting to find dominance.  The only thing in the way of Olthoi rule is the players.  Dark Majesty introduced a quest involving the Young Olthoi Queen, along with several other Olthoi dungeons.  While the majority of players will not be able to attack the Young Queen, as the dungeon is restricted to very high-level players, there are plenty of Olthoi that all players can participate in eradicating.  Turbine added an incentive to these quests with the addition of an experience points quests.  At the end of many of these dungeons are monsters that have a trophy item.  Once these items are turned in to a specific non-player character, a large amount of experience is awarded to the carrier.    Another wonderful addition to the patch is a skill credit quest, something players have desired for a very long time.  The skill credit quests gives players an additional skill credit by turning in a trophy item, which can make it easier for higher level players to gain much needed skills earlier.  This brings me to the one thing that caused the most excitement in months prior to release of this expansion.  Turbine added the much requested housing and storage.  Houses range from small cottages with a few rooms to large mansions that players can easily get lost in.  The larger homes also have House Portals that lead to private dungeons.  Chests and hooks are scattered throughout for storage purposes.  Chests can be used by anyone the house owner wants to give permission to, but hooks can only be used by the house owner and is more for decorative purposes, showcasing favorite trophies.  Also, the house can be furnished with items, like couches and tables, bought from a vendor.  Turbine made it particularly hard to obtain houses until the recent patch.  Writs and the trophy items necessary to obtain them were no-give.  There were also restrictions on the number of trophies that could be obtained.  There were three different kinds of monsters holding a different trophy item.  Each of these had a varying level of difficulty, so that lower level players could kill the easiest monsters and obtain a writ.  November's patch changed everything though, as writs are now givable and the trophies to get a writ are different.    A writ, in addition to a simply trophy item (which varied), some money and a level restriction (20), is all that is needed for a cottage.  Villas, on the other hand, require 5 writs, more money, a trophy item dropped from higher-level creatures, and level 35.  Mansions were not available at the release of the expansion, but will be released at a later date.  Mansions are restricted to rank 6 monarchs with a level of 50.  Graphically, the game has not changed much since its original release.  While this may be a turn-off to many players, I personally appreciate the graphics.  There are some truly beautiful sights in the game.  Climb up to a high mountain or go up the mage tower in Linvak Tukal, and look at the sun rising or setting, it is breathtaking.  They are updating the appearances of many of the monsters, and recently they changed the appearance of mosswarts, little green-colored creatures that looked more silly than mean.  Now, however, they look extremely mean.  As a long time player of Asheron's Call, the Dark Majesty Expansion added so much to the game that is really does feel like a whole new experience.  New players are at an advantage as they can buy the expansion and it includes the entire Asheron's Call game.  The game is extremely inexpensive and includes a free month, so there is no reason for anyone curious about the game to not take advantage now and check it out.  Asheron's Call is not Everquest or Anarchy Online, and fans of those games will find little familiar here.  The monsters are unique and the game changes every single month.  For me, there is no doubt that this expansion truly added a wonderful dimension to the land of Dereth.  -- Staci Krause      Want to share your opinions with the world?
