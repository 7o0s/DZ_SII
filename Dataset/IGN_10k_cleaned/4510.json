Remember how you always thought life without gravity and friction would be cool?  Given a strong pair of legs, you could be in Paris by noon and then off to Rio de Janeiro for a little taste of the night life.  But let me tell you, when it comes to piloting a 185,000 ton Dreadnought class Corvette, a little bit of pull toward center might be just what the captain ordered.   With Independence War, Particle Systems offers up a space simulation so convincing that it just may take a trip to the academy to get all of the commands down.  Unlike other space sims that focus on small fighter combat like the Wing Commander and X-Wing / Tie Fighter series, Independence War allows you to take command of a medium-sized, multi-role space vessel.  As a Commonwealth Naval officer fighting against the Independence movement, you will control all of the major stations of the Corvette, including pilot, navigation, engineering, and combat positions.  Although this makes for one heck of an exciting experience, it also makes gameplay hectic and the missions extremely difficult as you are constantly switching between stations in the heat of battle.  To make matters worse, even though you have a full bridge crew nobody else seems to give a damn when hot plasma is raining down on your hull.  C'mon people . . . little help here!       For those of you who crave combat action in a fighter craft equipped with an arsenal the Montana Freemen would salivate over, Independence War may not be for you.  The Dreadnaught is loaded with a lean weapon compliment consisting of two Particle Beam Cannons and two missile hardpoints.  Independence War also doesn't have the variety of weapons, ships, and races that its predecessors do.  You can't play on the side of the rebellion and although there are nearly 40 different ship types in the Independence War universe, you can only take command of the Corvette.  What Independence War does offer is a much more in-depth, detailed, and realistic experience than any space combat simulator to date.  You rarely go on a routine 'search-and-destroy' mission and your objectives often change in mid-mission, making for a more dynamic and random gaming experience.  The realistic physics, although difficult to get used to at first, give Independence War a genuine feel.  Since there is very little friction in space your ship slides when you make a sharp bank.  This can be disorienting and dangerous as you slow when turning, thereby making yourself an easy target.  But it can also be very helpful as you can fling your ship around with your lateral thrusters faster than you can make a full bank, making your Dreadnaught one powerful and maneuverable weapons platform.    Graphically, Independence War is one of the best games around.  The CGI cutscenes are incredible and the rendered ships are beautiful.  But space is quite a lonely place, so you better get used to looking at a bunch of little white dots before you jump into the command seat.     Although this title has been available in Europe under the name I-War for quite some time, the American release of Independence War includes 3Dfx support, an arcade mode with retrorocket assistance allowing for easier piloting, and numerous gameplay enhancements. European owners need not fret as Particle Systems has promised a free upgrade to bring I-WAR up to the full functionality of the US release.  Particle Systems also promises that a mission editor is in the works and will soon be available to all of you aspiring mission builders.  With all of this power at your grasp, the modest system requirements are surprising.  What this game is going to require is a lot of patience.  Independence War is hard.  I can't stress this enough, people.  You're only going to get out of this game what you put into it.  The designers were trying to create a realistic space combat simulation -- this is rocket science after all.  Particle Systems should be praised for their efforts.  Now let's see if the masses are ready to take on the challenge of Independence War.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Sep 11, 1998"}
