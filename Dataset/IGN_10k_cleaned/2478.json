{"name": "Ecco: Defender of the Future", "name_review": "Ecco the Dolphin: Import Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/13/ecco-the-dolphin-import-review", "text": "It seems that for many people the friendly Dolphin symbolizes the ~nicer~ aspects of the way we humans live our lives, namely cooperation, friendship and of course peacefulness.  It should come as no surprise then that a games developer would eventually capitalize on this idea and incorporate Dolphins in a game based around these friendly water-loving mammals.   Well, Appaloosa have done just this with Ecco The Dolphin for PS2.  Ported across from their Dreamcast version, this new title whilst being based on the same storyline, includes numerous enhancements due greatly in part to both player and reviewer criticisms of the DC version.    Story But before we go into those enhancements now, I thought for those who might not be familiar with the Ecco ~story,~ it might be beneficial to hear it from the developers mouth so to speak...  Here is Appaloosa's official take on the whole Ecco story:   ~Since the dawn of memory, Dolphins and Mankind observed, respected and admired each other from afar, sensing kindred spirits. But Dolphins concealed the true extent of their sentience, patiently awaiting Humanity's maturity. And, when at last Dolphins revealed their intelligence and culture, a Human-Dolphin civilization was born and The Golden Age began.   ~Centuries of peace and prosperity followed before signals arrived from beyond the Earth, compelling Dolphins and Humans to move into the vast unknown.   ~Some dolphins remained as caretakers of the Earth, which was protected by the single greatest creation of their civilization, the Guardian. A repository of wisdom and power, the Guardian was advisor and protector, linking those who had ventured outward to those who remained behind, and channeling the energies of the Earth itself to safeguard the planet.   ~And even as Humans and Dolphins went out in peace, forces dark and deadly scrutinized their world. These creatures feared the combined goodness and power that Dolphins and Humans carried to the stars, for their kind knew only conquest and domination. Driven by raw fear and hatred, they relentlessly probed for weakness, and upon finding it, struck. The Guardian was wounded, leaving the Earth defenseless before them.   ~Knowing they were unable to withstand the fury of the Humans and Dolphins who would surely return to defend their world, the Foe sought to strike a final blow and tore a fissure in space and time.   ~But this temporal vortex inadvertently bore a single Dolphin with it.   ~Ecco -- a dolphin of rare and special abilities -- found himself in the distant past, at the historic moment when Dolphins had gathered to reveal themselves to Humanity. The Foe had come to prevent this, robbing Dolphins of their emotional and intellectual qualities. Thus diminished, they were unable to contact Humans as equals. The great Human-Dolphin alliance was never founded, and the reality that produced Ecco never existed: for Ecco, there is no home to return to.   ~Ecco must travel back into the future in pursuit of the Dolphin qualities stolen and scattered by the Foe. There, he finds an unpleasant alternative future where Humanity's excesses -- unchecked by Dolphin's intrinsic qualities -- has resulted in a decaying, polluted nightmare world.~   If the player is successful, Ecco will find some of the Dolphin qualities in this alternative timeline. Restoring these to the Dolphins in the past results in yet another alternate future, in which Ecco must seek more of the stolen Dolphin qualities.   As the ~Defender of the Future,~ Ecco's mission is to travel through several alternate timelines, overcoming the obstacles and dangers inherent to each of these worlds in order to win his own future back.   Gameplay Quite a story, huh?  Now while you could read a lot into this preface, the fact of the matter is that in reality this game simply has you swimming around various watery worlds picking up crystals or in this case ~Vitalits,~ knocking off all sorts of villains ranging from sharks to poisonous jelly fish and at the end of the day exploring all worlds and saving the Earth from destruction.  Simple, you might think.  Well that's almost all there is to it.   As I mentioned previously, the developers have seen fit to include some changes or enhancements in a bid to alleviate some of the complaints leveled at the previous DC version. Appaloosa has now included a 3D overview map or Compass feature which when toggled via the select button enables you to view a sphere that contains colored stars or dots.  The dots on the surface of the sphere represent elements that are further away from Ecco.  When objects get closer to Ecco, they appear as stars that float inside the sphere.    Confused?  So was I at first.  The main problem is that the 3D compass or sphere is so darn small it's nearly impossible to see. The various colors of stars can be broken down into 5 categories.  White = Glyphs, Green = Objectives, Yellow = Friendly Dolphins, Blue = Ecco's Location, Red = Sharks/Danger.  This PS2 version also uses mini movies to help explain just what the objectives are in each level. Also, to further aid navigation there are now Glyphs that as well as looking darn near identical, also look a lot like the central core of a CPU embedded in colored transparent crystal. These Glyphs are activated when you use Ecco's sonar via the square button.  The Glyphs will then bring up hints on how to navigate through the task or section at hand. On the subject of sonar, Ecco possesses several types of sonar, of which one such as the Tractor sonar beam allows Ecco to hold on to objects at will.    As if all this wasn't enough, there is a further nav aid in the L3 button which when held down, will automatically point Ecco in the direction of the next objective.  As you can see, while there have certainly been some worthwhile navigation additions, it's a pity that the gameplay wasn't spiced up a bit.  Unless you are an AVID follower of the storyline, Ecco will for many gamers represent just so much watery graphical goodness devoid of any real challenge.  It isn't all entirely a loss as you do get bonuses in the form of movies and images, which can be had by collecting the Vitalits in various levels.  You can then view your bonuses in the Gallery section of the game. Apart from all this the game has some really glaring faults.    Most notable amongst them are the awkward camera angles and the AI of many of the enemy creatures, which is a bit suspect to say the least. Also, the Glyphs etc all look the same, which makes selection and or remembering where you've been at times far harder than it need be.  Although initially Ecco looks to be a pushover, in reality thanks to these factors, it is actually quite a challenge and can be frustratingly difficult in some levels.   Graphics  Although this game has no real depth to it if you pardon the pun, it is if nothing else lovely to look at. If it weren't for the mediocre frame rate, I'd probably give it top marks from a graphical standpoint.  Unfortunately the frame rate is rather poor and at times does certainly detract from not only a visual point of view, but more importantly from a gameplay perspective. It's darn hard trying to turn round to kill a whole ocean full of sharks when you can't see them until it's almost too late.  The water is probably the high point of this game.  I mean it really does look real.  Just hovering at the surface and looking down, the feeling of floating in 100 odd feet of water with sharks circling below is truly unsettling at times.  The environments are nicely detailed with the sandy bottom reproduced very well indeed complete with fine cloudy particles that are disturbed when Ecco swims close by.    Above the water all is not so well.  The whole atmosphere of the game changes and it's almost as if the developers were counting on you spending most of the time underwater.  All in all the graphics are quite nice with the only glaring faults being the dodgy frame rate and that sometimes sharks and the like swim a tad jerky and unrealistic for my liking.   Sound  The title and in game music score is suitably dreamlike and has a nice ~Hollywood~ almost Disney feel to it.  Being an underwater game about dolphins etc, it wasn't too much of a shock then that this game is chock full of dolphin sonar and high-pitched calls.  Even better is the fact that whale noises are also incorporated into the game.  The sound sampling is spot on and really quite accurate.  The only thing slightly overdone is the constant sound of gurgling bubbles, which are obviously not always present in an underwater environment. Although initially Ecco looks to be a pushover, in reality thanks to the additional features and tweaks, it is actually quite a challenge, though it must be said that it can be frustratingly difficult in some levels. Overall, Ecco just doesn't come up to speed. There are still far too many issues with regard to poorly defined navigation to recommend this game to buy. The whole thing is really quite slow and is almost boring at times. A game for people with staying power. Owen Jeffries is an avid gamer who writes for a wide assortment of publications.
