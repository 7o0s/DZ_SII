Bringing some hip-hop flavor to all this is Get on Da Mic that tries to recreate the magic with a selection of over 40 hip-hop songs that go as far back as ~Rapper's Delight.~ With a microphone, gamers can become players and rise up through the ranks. The only problem is that the game itself was rushed along and is now hitting the streets while still in an embryonic stage. Or at least that's what we're hoping because little in this game feels finished with the only saving grace being the music selection.   To get it out of the way as fast as possible there is no major connection from the gameplay of Karaoke Revolution and Get on Da Mic. First of all, Get on Da Mic does not even register pitch and in fact it only measures that noise is happening during when the lyrics should be sung. As long as there is audio in the right places success is guaranteed. While I was able to bust through a few songs like ~Humpty Dance~ and keep to the beat I was also able to get huge props from the virtual crowd by humming for the whole song, just saying ~bad-da-ba~ over and over or, my favorite, tapping the microphone on my jeans. All of these techniques worked equally well for winning lots of money in all of the different levels.   In addition to some simple singing mechanics there were some other curious things happening as well. Several times I would give up on trying to sing along for a second since the lyrics were shooting across the screen too fast (more on this later) to comprehend. Oddly enough, I was still scoring OK to good on some of the words I didn't even sing. If I put the mic down completely and stayed quiet it would register as bad, but that was the only time. It was an odd system overall and there's no feedback on just why I got some phrases right or wrong, just a color change in the on-screen lyrics from white to red (bad), yellow (OK), green (good) or flashing yellow (killed it). If you were hoping to get a game that would help you with your skills this game is not going to be of any use at all.     One of the biggest aids in the songs would be to have lyrics on the screen that are easy to read and prepare for, but this is thwarted in pretty much every way possible. The screen shows two lines of text at all times with a gray progress bar moving left to right on the current line. It's the current line because the current lyrics being sung alternate between the top and the bottom. This makes the lyrics harder to read with all of the rapid eye movement, especially with the faster songs.    With the lyrics, there's also a problem in that there is no standard of speed for the gray line. Sometimes it will be a long, slow crawl for a lyric with an interlude after it and sometimes it will speed up and clear the screen in a couple of seconds. There is no indicator for this or even any warning. To top it off, the gray bar on the screen does not correlate exactly with the timing of the lyrics which makes correct timing impossible for anyone not very familiar with the songs. All in all, the on-screen lyrics are more of a rough guide which works great for some basic karaoke as a crude reminder of the song, but for anyone hoping to learn some new skills this is yet another problem.     Now that we've gotten past the singing system there is still a rough game that's based on this as well that provides a rudimentary career mode. Players can pick a character and work up from singing in the bathroom up to a small competition, a recording session, a music video, and all the way up to a stadium. There is a total of 11 different stages to complete in the progression. To make this a career, characters win money for their skills and can buy some clothes or jewelry to modify their look. Oddly enough, players can also customize their crib or even buy a new one altogether. In the store there are different houses or mansions to buy as well as vehicles, luxury items like a jacuzzi, or a nice stereo system. None of this is ever seen in the game besides the loading screens so there's not much appeal in this, but it is in there. It's just a pile of bling for the sake of having it, but since it has no in-game effect it's an odd addition.   In the gameplay there are a few fun visual things going on here, but like everything else it just feels a little lacking. The characters are rapping in the middle of each scene, waving their arms and nodding their heads and if the rapping is good, then they'll go into a Rock the Mic mode with some special effects going off on screen. Do badly and the rapper will get frustrated and even start to break stuff. This all works out well enough, but the weird thing is that the on-screen rapper's movements have nothing to do with the song itself. Fast or slow, the movement will be the same. During the interludes in the song he's still there rapping like crazy. Even after the song is over the animation is still running. It provides as much interaction as the rest of the game and is just as useful in terms of gameplay.    So with a rough system of singing and pretty much everything else Get on Da Mic adds up to not much, but there is still a reason for checking it out: the music. There are over 40 songs and a sampling of the titles can be found here and here. These are not the original versions of the songs which explains why every title in the list includes the phrase ~made popular by~ in order to make the lawyers happy. A wide selection is here with Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Digital Underground, Snoop Dogg, Sir Mix-a-lot, and many others. What it all boils down to, and I do mean all, is whether or not you want to sing along with those songs. If so, then this is worth checking out since you can sing along to instrumental versions, but if not then skip it entirely.   To make the game a little more interesting there are a couple of multiplayer modes including the freestyle battle. Here, two players get a short amount of time to freestyle over the beats and they get rated by a third party who has the controller to award points or take them away. It's a fun mechanic, but ultimately it points out even more that Get on Da Mic is really just a karaoke program with a hip-hop emphasis and that the whole idea of a game has been loosely constructed and not even finalized. Get on Da Mic tries and fails to make a singing game with some hip-hop flavor, but in the end it's little more than a slightly interactive hip-hop karaoke program with a good selection of songs. If the music is enough to grab you and the game is on discount this would be worth a look. Otherwise this is a title that's worth a rental to check out the song list and sing along for a while. In a perfect world this game would provide some actual assistance for aspiring rappers or even lyrics that are readable, but that's dreaming of a future that's certainly not happening now.", "date": "Oct 7, 2004"}
