With Ninja Gaiden, Itagaki pledged to create a game with incredible graphics, lightning-fast gameplay, an ocean of blood, and an experience to remember. Throughout the long development process, numerous things could have gone wrong to foil those lofty promises. With the wrong type of enemy AI, combat could have become a derivative experience. Had Team Ninja gone for cookie-cutter level design, a long game could have felt a whole lot longer. If the controls weren't perfect, the Prince of Persia-like platforming would have been a nightmare. However, none of these horrible things happened. If you've been tootin' the horn of the hype train, keep on chuggin', because Ninja Gaiden is one of the best action games around, filled with innovative design, a deep combat system, tons of secrets and oh yes, enough blood to satisfy Carrie on Prom Night.  FeaturesClassic Ninja Gaiden series recreated for today's console Sixteen chapters of challenging gameplay across massive areas Upgrade weapons to unlock new combos Xbox Live tournaments offer new content and prizes Includes original three Ninja Gaiden NES games Over 20 hours of gameplay Sexy 5.1 Dolby Digital sound and 480p widescreen support Only on Xbox  Gameplay The original three Ninja Gaiden games, all of which came out on the NES, are 2D classics. The license has seen little console action since then, but Team Ninja has long-hoped to reinvent the 2D action titles in the 3D realm. Anyone who played the old school games will notice some familiar enemies and weapons, but the new Ninja Gaiden is so greatly advanced beyond what the originals offered in terms of gameplay and depth that comparing the two is like measuring atoms to atom bombs. Yeah, it's that good.  Strategy Guide Available! Slice off more        heads!                   Rid the world of fiends,                 find every Scarab, and                 unlock every secret.

Get The Guide | Watch the Video Review  Have Sword, Will Slice Ninja's are known for a few things -- They are quick, deadly with a sword, and are masters of stealth. Ninja Gaiden completely disregards the last attribute and instead focuses on combat and cool ninja wall-run moves. There is no stealth in the game. Zero. Zilch. Seriously though, even if there were moments for stealth, I would never go for them, because the combat in this game is as sweet as it gets. This is an action first slaughter-fest that also happens to take place across some rather sizable maps with almost no noticeable load times outside the start of each chapter. Sound hefty? It is.    Armed initially with the Dragon Sword, a blade carved from the tooth of a dragon, and an unlimited supply of shurikens, our hero, Ryu Hayabusa, eventually earns a healthy handful of powerful weapons. Each weapon has its own hefty set of combos and its own properties (some are fast, some are powerful, some just look really cool) making them more like characters in a fighting game than any hack and slash weapon you'd normally receive in a combat-heavy title. Most weapons can be upgraded at the local merchant (who also serves as a Blacksmith) to change their appearance and unlock deadlier combos.  The combat system is nearly flawless. It's incredibly intuitive and accessible to all types of gamers. You can easily try and hack-and-slash your way through enemies or you can learn the combos and makes things look cooler, work for bigger combo strings, and do your best to sever multiple heads at once. Blocking is just a squeeze of the Left Trigger and blocking comes quick so you can attack, block, and counter in the blink of an eye.  Adding to the mayhem is the ability to run along walls. Run directly at a wall and you'll run directly up it, finishing with a flip in the air (where more combos await) or you can run alongside a wall by jumping towards it. Presto, you are instantly running sideways. You aren't limited to just one wall-length either. Hit a corner and Ryu will continue his run along the wall or you can leap as you hit a corner to gain some altitude. In this manner, you can run circles around enemies diving and slashing.   As if that didn't make things crazy enough, you also get a ranged weapon mapped to the B Button. Take a few swipes at an enemy, leap off his head, and then dish out a dozen shurikens as his body vaporizes. That's not some kind of impossible trick only the experts can pull off. The controls are so simple that anyone playing the game for more than a half hour will be able to turn any combat into a stylized melee.      Combat is quick and furious with plenty of enemies coming at you with just about every room you enter. Fighting is also quite gruesome. Heads are easily lopped off and the signal that an enemy is truly dead is a gush of blood erupting from their torso. The blood doesn't stay around, unfortunately, but it's easy enough to make more.   To top things off, Ninpo (magic) is also available. Your Ninpo use is limited by a magic meter and there are only a few spells available, making for a specialized -- rather than routine -- attack. Like weapons, Ninpo can be upgraded to be bigger, badder, and more effective. Ninpo is perfect for situations where you are overrun with enemies or you can cast one just to see the pretty colors. The magic in Gaiden is clearly a throwback to numerous old school games that had any variety of screen-clearing bombs that would eviscerate anything onscreen. Ninpo never comes close to overpowering the game and I found myself always trying to save it for when it was truly needed.   So what will you be slicing during all of these fight scenes? There are a variety of enemies that will come at you, from your standard ninja to armed mercenaries to hideous demons. Each chapter seems to bring a new enemy. As you progress through Ninja Gaiden, the enemies bulk up. Mercs come with heavier armor and bigger weapons (just wait until you wall-run past an RPG), demons come in a series of nastier forms, and the bosses get more and more gruesome. The progression of enemy difficulty matches Ryu's improved weapons and the player's increasing skills perfectly. Everything is incredibly well-tuned. This is a 20-hour game (yes, it really does take 20 hours to complete) but there was never a moment where I got tired of the combat. Things keep changing, the combat stays fresh, and the challenge grows at an appropriate rate.  With combat this fast, there's no way a camera can possibly keep up with all of the action. To its credit, the camera always seems perfectly positioned at the start of combat, but as Ryu runs back and forth, he ends up moving so fast that the camera cannot always stay on track. There is a handy auto-center function, but it's only truly useful if you are not in the middle of running. Still, this may be the best a camera could be for Gaiden. Team Ninja clearly wanted to keep close on the action so that gamers could see the amazing level of detail in every character. It would have been nice if there was a toggle for a slightly distanced perspective, but in general the camera didn't give me too many troubles. Combat becomes almost instinctual, so there came a point where I didn't even notice moments when Ryu disappeared behind an enemy, because my fingers still worked their magic regardless.    Prince of Ninjas All that combat is nice and very, very dandy, but Ninja Gaiden is more than just an action game. Early on there is hardly any adventure elements and the first three chapters feature relatively straightforward maps, but the deeper you get into the game, the more adventure elements begin springing up. Though there are some simple fetch quests to unlock doors, there are some really cool platform challenges thrown in the mix. The most memorable is Itagaki's take on Raiders of the Lost Ark. After outracing a giant boulder as imagined by Team Ninja, Prince of Persia lost a slight bit of luster. Damn if it isn't cool and there are several other nice moments just like it.  The puzzles alter the pace of the game so that the first few hours are mainly about combat and learning the system, but the moment a gamer might feel they've seen enough of the combat, other skills are suddenly required. Now it's a matter of mastering wall runs and jumps. That doesn't mean there isn't a load of fighting in the game, there is, but there are also some puzzle moments to break things up. None of the puzzles feel contrived. This is a beautiful, organic game where every element works in tandem.  The one thing that can get frustrating is that there are often few clues as to where to go for certain puzzles and since most areas have branching paths (but also have very helpful maps) there were times when I wasn't sure which way to go. For the most part, Gaiden keeps you pointed in the right direction, but not all the time. Mix in some necessary backtracking (see below) and there are a few moments where my smile slips slightly while playing.    Level Design Beyond Belief Ninja Gaiden's crowning achievement is its impressive design. You will find puzzles early in the game that will not be solved until the penultimate chapter. Some of the maps are truly enormous, but what makes it thrilling is discovering how the majority of areas are connected. You may start in the city of Tairon, go through a series of catacombs, a sewer, what have you, and eventually emerge back in Tairon through an entrance that was previously locked.   Everything is expertly laid out so that you get a glimpse of some future event that won't be realized for several hours. In Tairon, for example, there's one moment where you are running alongside a moat. Look down all you want, stare at the giant fish, but there's no way to get down into the water yet. Play for another eight hours or so and you'll find yourself having to traverse that moat and contend with those fish. If you are observant, you'll spot lots of these little moments. It's always nice when a game can offer little Neo ~whoa~ moments.   Action games are rarely (if ever) built on such a large scale, especially a game this hard. Yeah, Ninja Gaiden will kick you in the softies at times, offering the satisfaction of beating a tough game but also the desire to earn a good ranking (which is rewarded at the end of each Chapter based on clear time, enemies killed, and several other factors). I kept thinking, ~Man, I can't wait to play through this again now that I know what I'm doing,~ but the game just keeps going. It's much bigger than I could have possibly imagined.   Now if the game involved playing through the same areas over and over, well, then it would be a hellish 20 hours, but each area is unique unto itself. There's a different feel when you reach a new map, different accompanying music, and usually different enemies. From start to finish, no two maps look the same and run the gamut from ninja fortress to Zeppelin to ice cavern to cathedral to lava lake.   There is some backtracking in the game, but not all of it is mandatory. If you get your ass handed to you by a boss repeatedly, it may be time to run back towards the local merchant to stock up on healing potions. Some fetch quests are spread out over long periods or great distances, but thanks to the interweaving of areas, you almost always end up where you need to be when you need to be there.     One design aspect that I did hate, one that many people may be dissatisfied with, is the swimming. Yes, Ryu is an excellent swimmer, but that skill is never really tested until about two-thirds through the game, when Ryu is suddenly forced into a mostly-aquatic chapter. The swim controls aren't nearly as fluid as those on land, but you still have a couple of underwater attacks. The swimming simply goes on too long and just isn't that interesting. This is the one aspect of level design where I felt Team Ninja had a misstep. Fortunately, it doesn't last too long and once you're past it, you never need to swim again.  My only other big gripe comes with some of the ending action. Near the final chapters of the game, the rules seem to change. Where you once were able to save between bosses, you're suddenly forced to fight several in a row and are placed far, far, far from anywhere you can restock on health. Here you have to backtrack through multiple areas to get to a merchant to restock health and then you must fight through scores of enemies just to return to your original position. This isn't something that happens throughout Ninja Gaiden just near the end. There are also some very annoying Ghost Piranha that tend to kill Ryu faster than the biggest of the big enemies. A slight slip for a great game as it nears its conclusion, but I promise that beating the game unlocks one of the coolest weapons you could ask for.  Variety is the Spice of Life Ninja Gaiden relies heavily on combat. There's no way to get through the game without being able to kick some ass. This is a tough as nuts adventure, though not quite at the level of MDK 2 or Viewtiful Joe. But you don't have to kick ass the same way as your buddy. There's often more than one way to beat any enemy or master a platforming challenge. I've beaten the same bosses different ways, so I know it's possible to use lots of combos or to dodge for a while and get in a quick, powerful strike.       There's a great range of bosses (cyborgs, giant worms, tanks). Even ninjas shouldn't be forced to fight it out with a Tomahawk chopper, but Ryu must in one of the cooler boss battles in Gaiden. The majority of bosses have quite a number of different attacks and even though they end up falling into patterns, the same boss fight can often be different from one play attempt to the next. One boss I fought immediately used a devastating attack that took off half my health. She had over a half-dozen different ~boss-type~ attacks. She beat me the first time, so I go back to her again and that amazing attack she kicked off with the first time isn't even used at all the second time around. She had enough variety that there were attacks I didn't see in a particular battle. How many times can you say that about a game?   It's this level of variety (in the maps, enemies, bosses, weapons, and combat) that sustains Ninja Gaiden through 20 hours of gameplay. The story, which is what usually drives a title this lengthy, is one of the weaker aspects of NG. Though there are a few nice twists and some tent-popping CG, there's just not a lot there to get invested in. A little more narrative sprinkled through the long chapters would have helped some.   Master Tournament As if all of these elements weren't enough to excite, Ninja Gaiden will also feature an online tournament this summer for those who've beaten the single player game. Details on the tourney are still emerging, but it will do something unique in that the online trial missions will not be downloadable content, but will actually be streamed to your Xbox. Though there's nothing available to check out yet, the online aspects are always a nice addition to any game and will certainly add a little extra replay value for those with Xbox Live.  Graphics Gamers nowadays are spoiled. Ninja Gaiden is one of the best-looking games around with more beauty in its pinky than any game I grew up playing. While it's true that there are some aspects of Gaiden's graphics that could be spiffed up (some jaggies here and there, little is done with lighting, and Ryu never gets dirty despite all that blood flying around), this is easily one of the prettiest games on the Xbox.     As a hardcore action game, it's important that Ryu moves at a smooth 60 frames. Oddly enough, the only time I ever noticed a framerate drop is after slaughtering a dozen bats in one swift attack. Otherwise, this game runs like Michael Johnson -- as fast as humanly possible. It takes only a glance at some of the screenshots for this game (yes, the game actually looks that good) and it's easy to see the level of detail in the environment and characters. Particle effects are aplenty as Ryu's sword blocks bring colorful sparks, a magic attack offers a blinding light show, and a quick flick of the ninja's wrist severs the head from a mercenary's body, blood gushing like Old Faithful.   But graphics aren't just about show. Certainly Gaiden has some great pop to it, but what's more impressive is the variety offered. This is a 20 hour experience, but for much of it the environments feel distinct. When traveling from one large area to the next, there's never a moment where you have to wonder what location you've entered. You begin fighting ninjas, but as the game progresses you slowly encounter new menaces. Each and every chapter offers something new to fight. That's not easy.  All of this beauty, however, pales in comparison to the stunning CG cut-scenes. Though some of the smaller scenes are rendered in real-time, the memorable moments come with unforgettable visual flare. Team Ninja has always done CG masterfully, but none of their previous work comes close to this. Sure, the story seems sort of pieced together, but at least those pieces come out looking sweet. No amount of detail is left untouched in these moments. Go ahead, count the individual strands of hair on Ayane's cute little noggin. Itagaki knows that cut-scenes are a reward for gameplay and most of the one's enjoyed in Ninja Gaiden come after a tough battle.  No, this is not the perfect visual presentation. The lack of a deep dynamic lighting system and some weaker textures in certain areas hurt a little, but there's far too much else that is appealing. Considering the depth and variety of visuals, the scorching framerate despite the numerous enemies and particles flying around, and the ~don't you dare blink~ CG cut-scenes, it's hard to ask for anything more.    Sound The varied visuals are matched by the changing score. While there are plenty of good games out there that offer a variety of musical tracks to accompany different levels, I'm not sure there's another game around that has as big a range as Ninja Gaiden's score. Each piece of music fits the environment, so when you are traveling through the belly of a Zeppelin fighting mercenaries armed with the latest military spec, you get synthetic techno beats that don't fall too far from the Dead or Alive tree. But when you are in a more traditional ninja setting there's a full orchestral track that sweeps through as you clean up demon fiends.   The variety is there, though I'm not that big a fan of some of the pieces. None of the music overpowers and fits in as perfect background noise. That allows for the sick squish of blood spurting from enemies to be heard loud and clear. Each weapon has several sound effects based on what they are striking. So, hitting metal and stone sound slightly different and, of course, slicing through a baddie offers its own unique flavor. Enemies make minimal noises, which is a shame. On occasion you'll hear some human chatter as you rip through enemies, but it's not anywhere near the level of quips heard in Halo.  To say that the good sound in Ninja Gaiden is its weakest aspect seems silly, but the rest of the game is so strong that the sound is overshadowed by the visuals and gameplay. The sound never gets in the way, but it doesn't add as much as it could. And, as feared, the English voice acting is sub-par. Fortunately, you can swap in the Japanese dub instead, so even if the Japanese actors suck, unless you speak Japanese it's tough to tell.There are a few things Ninja Gaiden does wrong. There's some backtracking, some fights near the end that seem a bit unfair, and a camera that is at times bothersome. However, these minor points are just that, minor. There is no perfect game, but there are those that come close. Ninja Gaiden sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore. It is Itagaki's masterpiece, easily Team Ninja's best work, and one of the finest games on the Xbox to date. How many action games combine great controls, amazing visuals, superb gameplay, and incredible design? Not many. What's most impressive to me is how over a dozen areas overlap with one another and how Team Ninja perfectly nailed game progression. Many games in the same genre either stay at the same difficulty or suddenly ramp up the difficulty at the very end for no apparent reason. But with Ninja Gaiden, each chapter brings slightly more difficult enemies. It doesn't just stop with the enemies, though, as the early parts of the game are very light on puzzles and platforming challenges, but just as you get a handle on combat, the platforming aspects kick into high gear. It just doesn't get stale or repetitive. I never once rolled my eyes when enemies appeared and sighed, ~Oh boy, more of this crap.~ Instead it was muttering, ~Oh crap, I don't wanna die after having just getting past that last set of enemies! Must. Cowboy. Up.~All these words (and boy, I've typed quite a lot of them for this review) lead up to a final score. Scoring any great game is difficult, because the difference between say a 9.4 and a 9.5 is much greater than the difference between an 8.4 and an 8.5. In the end, Ninja Gaiden doesn't deliver quite as great an experience as Halo and its depth does not match Knights of the Old Republic. It would have been helpful to have the ability to toggle a close and raised camera perspective and the story could have been more involving considering the length of the game. Really, all of those concerns are small potatoes compared to the overall experience. This is a great game, one of the best on any system, and worth more than one play through.", "date": "Feb 27, 2004"}
