Looking to fill one notch in that void is LucasArts' RTX Red Rock, a third-person action-adventure game that takes place on, you guessed it, Mars.  Gameplay  RTX Red Rock is filled with concepts and ideas that look great on paper, but are executed in a flawed manner. First is the planet Mars. Though the game is set in the future, much of the planet is left barren with the exception of a few structures that you eventually enter and explore. To put it simply, these surface levels are simply dull and provide little in ways of stimulating action, challenging platforming or gripping action.  Besides taking place on the planet Mars, RTX Red Rock has two big gimmicks that it attempts to use to separate it from the overflowing crowd of third-person action-adventure games: four spectrum (vision) modes, and a synthetic arm that can be upgraded with different tools and weapons. Each of the four vision modes (thermoscan, naviscan, electroscan, and bioscan) has a specified use, not unlike the varied visor modes in Metroid Prime. And while this concept worked fantastically well in the latter game, in RTX Red Rock, the execution and interface make the game more unwieldy than need be.   Take for example the Naviscan spectrum mode, the mode used to view mission objectives, and also maps. Say you wanted to check the most recently downloaded map to see your current position, and also where your next objective is. This process requires the player to select the vision mode, activate it and then hold L2 to finally see the map. The fact that you can't move while viewing the map forces players to constantly check the map, progress forward a bit, check the map again, and so on and so on. And if you couldn't tell, this is just as frustrating as it sounds. But the problem here isn't specifically the Naviscan mode. It's the way that the spectrum mode concept is implemented; the user interface is clunky at best, and having to switch between them as much as you do is simply chore-like and unneeded; a good example of a promising concept gone wild (volume 2, that is).    So we take it back: RTX Red Rock actually has more than just two gimmicks that it leans on for support. With the exception of the spectrum modes and interchangeable arm pieces, RTX also has controllable robots and a variety of vehicles that the player can utilize. Both become available as situations arise requiring the use of such tools, and lucky for us, the vehicles don't resort to some abstract new control scheme that requires a tutorial in itself. Rather, the controls remain relatively intact throughout the game, which goes a long way in creating a seamless adventure.      Like we mentioned earlier, RTX Red Rock sounds like a great game on paper. With cool-sounding vision modes, vehicles and robots, and upgradeable arm parts, not too mention that the game takes place on Mars, you'd think that RTX would be quite a memorable experience. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Numerous factors contribute the game's failed attempt at a compelling experience, but one of the more significant features is the poorly designed user interface. Rather than having necessary actions mapped only one step away, RTX forces to players to take several steps, ruining the pacing of the game. You're just too aware of the game from an outside point of view to feel any suspension of disbelief, and that my friend, is not a desirable characteristic.   Another considerable flaw in RTX is the sheer lack of motivation and excitement. It's somewhat hard to put a finger on as to why, but there is never a feeling of urgency or thrill throughout the game. Also, the level designs are either too straight forward or frustratingly obtuse. All of this boils down to the fact that the game is soulless and lacking in charisma in more ways than not.   Graphics RTX Red Rock isn't a bad-looking game. In fact, Wheeler's character model is reasonably detailed, as are some of the interior environments. Additionally, the FMV cutscenes in the game are extremely well done. But for every good visual element in the game, up come two negative aspects that ruin most of the game's visual appeal. The first thing that pops up is the dodgy framerate. While tame in certain areas, battles and outdoor environments take the game way below the 30 fps sweet spot. There are also random occasions where an empty hallway will cause the game to chug -- not a good thing.  But as much as we can forgive an unsteady framerate, we're much more hesitant to look past boring and monotonous environments. Granted, the physical surface of the game's locale -- that's Mars for those of you not paying attention -- is more or less accurately represented as barren, rocky and red, but a little imagination wouldn't hurt. Heck, even Total Recall did a decent job of creating a lively and arguably desirable red planet. But between the look-a-like space stations and sea of red rock, you'll have a hard time finding any sort of visual stimulation. And let's not get into the uninspired enemy designs and crude animations  A brief time with RTX Red Rock may convey a cool Mars aesthetic, but it's over time that the uniformity of the game's visuals begin wear on you. And wear they will.   Sound There seems to be a dichotomy in regards to the sound in RTX. The cutscenes contain great, cinematic scores and even some above-average voice acting, but the in-game music is noticeably of lesser quality. Consisting of a blend of ambient environmental sound effects and a weak future-electro soundtrack, the gameplay sounds leave a bit to be desired.   The worst sound offender, though, has to be the gunshot effects. When we think of a gunshot, we think of a loud, pain-inducing boom that has some power to it. Unfortunately, the gunfire effect in RTX is laughably weak; there's no loud boom, and there's definitely not any power behind the blasts. While it may sound (no pun intended) like a trivial criticism, the wimpy sound actually makes the game's shootouts feel emptier than they already are. Too bad.  RTX Red Rock has a lot of features and varied gameplay elements but fails to deliver where it counts. The gameplay is unfocused and bland, and from a purely superficial level, it has its share of technical problems too. It's hard to recommend this game for most players, though those with an interest in Mars may find some redeeming qualities about the game.", "date": "Jun 19, 2003"}
