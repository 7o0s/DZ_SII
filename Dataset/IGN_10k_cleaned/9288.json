Even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the original title, they named their new game, set in a fantasy world, Total Annihilation: Kingdoms to tell purchasers that they could expect the same level of excellence from this product as they enjoyed in the company's last release. Unfortunately this just isn't so. While there's no doubt that Kingdoms looks worlds better than Total Annihilation, the developers seem to have forgotten just how important things like unit design, game balance and level concept can be when putting together an RTS.  Kingdoms' storyline is actually pretty damn good. A powerful wizard/inventor, Garacaius, brings together the entire planet by flexing his magical and muscle and using his unequaled powers of leadership. Afterward he settles down to enjoy his efforts and fathers four children, all of whom are pretty remarkable in their own right (personally I'd have thrown back the one with bat ears, but I'm pretty weird about that kind of stuff). After many years, the Empress of the land died in a boating accident. Garacaius was never the same and eventually split rulership of the land, and possession of his magic items, up among his four children. To Elsin, the most normal looking of the lot (and an aspiring engineer of no mean talents) he gave Aramon, the fairest of the four lands and a pendant containing the magical Stone of Darien. To Thirsha, the dark haired huntress he gave the wild woods of Zhon and a bracelet containing Soul of Khandra. To his dark mage-son Lokken, Garacaius gave the volcanic and dangerous land of Taros along with a scepter forged around Angvir's Flame, a mystical stone. Finally, he turned over the island lands of Veruna to his youngest daughter Kirenna and entrusted her with the stone called Macha's Tear. After his land was split, Garacaius returned to his throne (which contained within it the last of the five great artifacts, the Eye of Modron) and hid away from his former responsibilities. Ten years later, he and the stone disappeared mysteriously from the castle.  Okay, there's a little mystery, but so what? You've got four lands and four kings all of whom are particularly well suited to govern their land. As a matter of fact, things do go pretty smoothly for the next 1,527 years. All of the kids are still running their prospective kingdoms, granted immortality by their artifacts and their kingdoms have grown to be even more prosperous since they have come under control of rulers who care only about the needs and demands of that specific region. Unfortunately (and perhaps predictably) it doesn't last. With their father out of the picture, some of the mage-kings (particularly Lokken) have decided that they are no longer satisfied with what land they have been given. As the game begins, the undead armies of Lokken are marching on Aramon. Now comes your part.  If you've played any RTS game, you have a pretty good idea of how Kingdoms works. Before each mission you are given a short cutscene, which looks like it crawled straight off a History channel documentary, that explains which army you will be in control of and what the current political situation is. Once the game gets rolling you collect mana (the game's only resource) from powerstones (which can only be placed on certain areas of the map), build units and then send them out against the enemy army. The entire game is portrayed as if you were hovering over the action from a fixed distance and the critters in the game are big enough to find quickly with your mouse when you need 'em. Furthermore, the entire game looks amazing, with impressively detailed 3D characters moving fluidly over an equally beautiful 2D map. So far, so good. Now let's take a look at why it doesn't work as well as it should.  The first problem I had with the game is its bizarre play structure. Instead of giving you the chance to play as each of the four kingdoms separately, taking your kingdom to victory through a connected series of battles, you play out the entire conflict from all sides at once. At the beginning of each battle, you are dropped in the role of either attacker or aggressor and given a task that pertains to what is happening on the political landscape at that particular time. While I applaud the attempt at something new, as a storytelling device it simply doesn't work. Since you never play as the same country from game to game, you cease to have a vested interest in what happens. While there's no doubt that the game's cutscenes make you want to finish a level and find out what happens next, after a few battles, you'll realize that you don't give a damn about the people that you're in control of. After all, they may be the enemy next time around... Why should I care when Thirsha finds herself in danger towards the end of a battle? She attacked my troops in the last mission. Worse still, since you're switching about so often, it's really hard to become an expert with any of the different sides and their units. After about four hours with this game, I was completely oblivious to who I was playing in a given mission and what their goals were. Each mission I would take a quick look at what units were available to me and where the mana sources were, then I started building without any emotional attachment whatsoever. Which brings me to my next set of problems.  In nearly every RTS that has hit shelves, making the best use out of the resources you have is one of the most important skills to master. In Command & Conquer, for example, if you waste all of your Tiberium on building useless units, you'll be screwed by the end game. The same can be said for Warcraft, Starcraft, and oddly enough, Total Annihilation. In Kingdoms, mana is unlimited. As long as you can get a powerstone on a source area, you can start generating the raw stuff that you need to make units. Once again, while I appreciate the design team trying something new, it just doesn't work in practice. With few exceptions, each mission consists of you building up a big defense and building as many units as you are allowed to (the game has a unit cap, which really bugs me... where's the suspension of disbelief here?) and then marching your huge army against the enemy fortress. This is really fun towards the beginning of the game (you get to see large troop masses right off the bat), but quickly becomes mighty dull after the fifth or sixth time you see it happen. Especially when you consider how similar a lot of your units are.  That's right, I said similar. Although it looks at first glance like Kingdoms has a ridiculous assortment of different units for each side, on closer examination you'll realize that many of them are merely variations on a theme. On the Veruna side, for instance, you have the Warrior and the Berserker. Both of them are hand-to-hand units that serve almost identical purposes. Since resources are unlimited, why on Earth would I ever want to bother building a Warrior (answer: I wouldn't). The same sort of thing can be said for Veruna's Crossbowman and Musketeer, Aramon's Swordsman and Barbarian, Zhon's Beast Handler, Beast Tamer and Beast Lord and Taros' Zombie and Executioner. Many of the so-called 'different units' are just stronger versions of the same unit that render their predecessor obsolete. It would be really cool to see an army constructed of five or six different units, but most of the time you'll see a large mass of foot soldiers, a large mass of archers and some flying creatures acting as support. Once again, after a few plays, this gets really dull and you have a feeling that you've seen it all before. Worse still, you'll find that most of the units don't seem to be play tested all that well, with defensive units holding a remarkable advantage over unbelievably weak offensive units that crumble after a couple of solid blows. Launching a successful attack becomes more about getting there before an enemy has created a defensive structure than finding weakness in that structure and overcoming them.  Which brings us to unit control. I had all sorts of pathing problems, but that's not the real issue here. The real problem is that hand-to-hand units, when told to move to a particular location, will not attack anything until they get to that location. This means that if you tell a group to move to certain area, you must watch them every step of the way. If you take your eyes off of them for a second and they run into enemy resistance, they'll be hacked to pieces by the enemy area as they shove through. You can almost see their little faces mouthing, ~Excuse me please, I just need to get through here.~ The drudgery of watching every move my troops made often became overwhelming and I would catch myself powering down for the night long before my allotted playtime was up.  There's plenty of other smaller problems with Kingdoms (like the lukewarm soundtrack), but I think I've hit all the high points. And the fact is, Kingdoms isn't really all that bad. The real disappointment is that a startup company, who seemed to have such a good grasp on what makes real-time strategy games work well, would take such a good looking game and ruin it with amateur's mistakes. If you've gotten plenty bored with Starcraft and are looking for a new strategy title to gobble up your summer days, you'll probably find some distraction with Kingdoms. If your money's tight though, and you can only afford to buy the very best, you'll probably want to save up for the next big thing.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jul 7, 1999"}
