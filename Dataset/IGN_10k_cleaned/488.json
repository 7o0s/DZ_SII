Usually the games don't even come out until months after the movie's disappeared, and then they usually suck. Casper is, sadly, no exception.  You are Casper, and while the prospect of being a ghost could be really cool, somehow the game's designers have managed to take all the joy out of it. In fact, the very premise of the game goes contrary to all ghost folklore, namely the ability to pass through solid objects. You must move Casper through a mansion, finding keys to open doors and secret passageways. Yeah, that's right, a ghost needs keys to open doors. Who knew?  The graphics are decent at best, but the skewed top-down view makes everything seem flat. Not to mention the utter sense of pointlessness you feel just wandering around, with nothing for Casper to do except look stupid. To their credit, the designers have thrown in some action, like when you get chased around by Casper's mean uncles, but Casper can't fight back, so all you can do is run away. What fun is that? Even little kids, who the game is presumably aimed at, won't like it.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
