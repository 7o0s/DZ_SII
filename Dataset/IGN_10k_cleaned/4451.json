It's the Xbox version of the PC sequel that appeared last year as a separate product from Unreal Tournament 2K3, which was very similar to the Unreal Championship that appeared on Xbox. Confused yet? Just know that Unreal 1 was never on Xbox even though Unreal II is the second appearance of the franchise on Xbox.  You may have to hop back to some of our initial UC coverage to refresh your memory but all of Xboxdom was giddy at the thought of team-based multiplayer games and vehicles scurrying about on Xbox Live. Now that Atari, Tantalus and Legend Entertainment have finally delivered Unreal II to Xbox, we know what all the fuss was about. All of those features do indeed make for decent FPS experience even if it does feel a bit dated and outgunned --so to speak-- by more popular shooters on Xbox. The fact that Unreal II feels too closely related to its PC counterpart from a year ago ends up costing the game a few points in terms of control and just overall tuning.  Gameplay  The single player campaign casts players in the role of TCA Marshal Dalton and takes you on a short adventure throughout the galaxy righting wrongs and handing out a lot of death to a lot of enemies. The rundown of weapons in Unreal II is very much in line with what you'd expect from an Unreal game and they all look, sound and feel very satisfying. The grenade launcher with interchangeable grenade rounds is hands-down favorite because of its versatility and owning potential. All weapons have secondary fire functions, and some are more lethal than others, like the bundled five shot slug the assault rifle spits out when all of those little fast bullets just aren't enough. There was a lot of fanfare about the quality of the flame effects in Unreal II for the PC, and that distinction carries over to this Xbox version thanks to all of the stuff you'll be burning with the fantastic flamethrower, our second favorite weapon.     While the weaponry is well designed and executed, the problems in Unreal II begin when you start using them. The aiming is not as bad as most PC to console ports with relatively smooth  and fluid control on the analog sticks. However it seems the enemy AI routines and animation haven't been enhanced for the console with their herky-jerky movements. You'll find yourself fighting the controls and cursing to yourself as you try to put the reticule on the bad guy and blow him away but it's really the way they move, not the way you're shooting that's the problem. The default sensitivity gives you a nice, intuitive feel but since there's never anyway analog sticks will be able to match up to mouse-and-keyboard controls, the enemy behavior has to be better adapted for the console player than this.       The story in Unreal II is presented well enough with lots of cutscenes and decent dialogue. Using the game engine to render the cinemas proves problematic often enough that it might've been a better idea for the developers to go in a different direction. The unnatural jerky animations of NPCs you get during gameplay end up ruining the suddenly less-dramatic cutscenes that are trying to advance the story. For the most part however, you're pushed and lead in the right direction both during real-time gameplay and cinemas. The only level that really got to us in terms of getting lost was the swampy Dagobah-like planet where every green and purple tree looks the same. Space marines just shouldn't have to do that much walking when there's a space ship around.  XMP is the name of the multiplayer component in Unreal II, and predictably ends up being the strength of the game. Teamwork, base management and vehicle deployment are the name of this game that can only be played over Xbox Live. You have three different classes of soldier you can use each with unique equipment and special abilities that are well balanced enough that you'll need plenty of people who are good at using all of them. Building temporary forcefields, maintaining generators to keep your team powered and managing spawn points and other battlefield valuables make XMP sophisticated enough for hardcore gamers but still rowdy and exciting enough for more casual players. The only thing that holds this game mode back is the number of players (8) and the number of maps (4) initially available. More maps should be on the way through Xbox Live download but adding more players or even bots probably isn't going to happen. The mode just isn't nearly as fully featured as some other Xbox Live shooters, but what it does offer is well done and a lot of fun. Running around in jeeps and tanks that can carry multiple players will appeal to Xbox gamers who also enjoyed the Tribes series on PC.   Graphics  The look of Unreal II is a mixed bag of good and bad that's initially impressive but doesn't hold up under closer scrutiny. The environments at times can be breathtaking with huge vistas and busy locales with flames, weather and stuff going on. The textures are marvelously done for the most part conveying the exact feel of the environment in question. The lighting is decent and works well with the rest of the game, but nothing too spectacular like the soft bloom lighting that's been all the rage in Xbox games in recent months.      The particle effects are also very well done in Unreal II. The weapons all fire unique rounds and there's no mistaking the secondary function when you hit the left trigger to unleash something special. When they come into contact with structures and enemies  the explosions or other effects do their part of looking realistic even if the critter in question doesn't. Nothing should keel over as unnaturally as the enemies in this game.  There's just far too much clipping, choppy animation and other shortcomings scattered throughout Unreal II for this game to be designated as a stunner. As a 2004 Xbox title, port or not, a game with this pedigree and this name recognition simply needs to look better overall. Had this been 2002 or even 2001 when we were supposed to get all of this Unreality wrapped up into one game, it would be a different story.   Sound  The sound is nothing outstanding but the voice acting is mediocre and the surround sound is well executed.  A lot of the humor and subtlety in the dialogue gets lost because of some of the voice acting, but for the most part we get where the developers were trying to go. The mixed-up transliterations of Dalton's alien pilot is funny but only when you squint your ears to get what he's trying to say. Overacting while voicing a videogame certainly isn't a crime.   The sound is done well enough so that you will have to listen and you will be rewarded for listening throughout the game. Communications from other characters can be crucial, especially in levels where you may start to get a little lost. Weapon and critter sound effects are all done well enough and don't hurt anything Unreal II is trying to do.    Unreal II is a decent first person shooter, but certainly nothing thats going to make you forget the cream of the crop thats available on Xbox. Pound for pound, I like it more than Unreal Championship because of the XMP mode, but thats only if theres a full complement of players to run with me. When compared to other futuristic first person shooters, its head and shoulders below the all-powerful Halo but its probably a good example of what Mace Griffin was trying to be.Even though theyre two completely different types of games, I couldnt help but compare Unreal II to a first person version of Brute Force in terms of art and emphasis on impressive environments above all. So somewhere in the middle of the isosceles triangle created by Halo, Brute Force and Mace Griffin lies Unreal II. If youre a sci-fi shooter junkie then say hello to your next adventure, otherwise Xbox fans dont need to jump all over this one.", "date": "Feb 11, 2004"}
