With the mass-market, stylish and trendy Game Boy Micro hitting the scene this year, the GBA library can use a bit of aging, and nothing attracts the older crowd than a batch of familiar names from gaming past. Gauntlet / Rampart is clearly an attractive package to the casual consumer because of Gauntlet: you couldn't hit an arcade back in the mid-80s without a crowd around one of those massive Gauntlet arcade machines. Rampart was a minor hit for Atari back during its original arcade release as well, but it still holds a place in the heart of arcade attendees of yesteryear.   As familiar and desirable as the games in the pack may be, Gauntlet / Rampart is, unfortunately, another DSI Games compilation that completely misses the point, misses the mark, and misses a huge opportunity. Once people spend the 15 bucks because of the names on the box, they'll be faced with a hollow shell of the games they're supposed to represent.   Gauntlet was a true Atari classic, taking the concept and popularity of the Dungeons & Dragons universe and moving a clone of it into a cooperative action dungeon exploration game. Four people as different classes (warrior, valkyrie, elf, wizard) blast their way through ghost, grunt, and demon-infested corridors, collecting treasures for points and food for health. Rampart was a clever combination of ~Missile Command meets Tetris~ where players defend their castles against opposing enemies in one round, building up their fortress with puzzle pieces in the next. Both games have been ported to gazillions of game systems since their release with varying levels of success.   The GBA version of Gauntlet, on the surface, looks and sounds absolutely spot-on to the classic arcade game. The development team lifted all the arcade artwork and sound effects for this GBA conversion, and got an engine that can handle the huge amount of on-screen enemy sprites. The game design features the dozens of maps from the arcade game. The problem: it's only single player. Gauntlet is a dreadfully dull game as a solo outing, and it was only when players worked together that the game actually became one of the greatest times ever had in the arcade. As a single player game, it never gets to be any fun, simply becoming a mindless romp. On top of this, players can't save their progress or even put the game in sleep mode when the action becomes overwhelmingly tedious.   Rampart, again, looks and sounds exactly like the arcade game. But unlike Gauntlet, the port of Rampart is entirely broken in comparison to the original design. First comes the dreadful lag issue -- every time you place a tile on the field, the game pauses for up to three seconds, most likely calculating if that piece is completing a wall circuit around the field. Second: the game doesn't follow the rules of Rampart. The original concept rewarded players with additional cannons for each castle they surround on the field in addition to the home castle, but on the GBA, each round simply offers two additional cannons no matter how many extra castles have been rescued. Players could also destroy land-based ~tanks~ by surrounding them with walls, but in the GBA game, these enemy tanks stay alive within your protected base and will destroy these castles even when they're within your ~safe~ zone.   But most importantly, Rampart, like Gauntlet, lacks multiplayer. The game was a passable single player ~Man against Ships~ design, but Rampart absolutely kicked ass when it was a three player fortress competition. This is the first port of Rampart on a multiplayer-capable system that lacks multiplayer (the Game Boy Color version had link cable two player), and the weakness of single player Rampart shows when multiplayer isn't even an option.  Its getting more and more disheartening to see poor GBA representations of the classic arcade games I grew up and loved back in the day. These games make for perfect plug-and-play portable titles, yet the team members responsible in porting them from arcade to Game Boy for DSI Games clearly don't ~get it.~ Rampart / Gauntlet could have been a truly must have classic compilation for the 15 bucks had the developers actually focused on what made these games great to begin with. That didn't happen here.", "date": "Sep 14, 2005"}
