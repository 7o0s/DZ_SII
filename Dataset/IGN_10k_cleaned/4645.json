However, the same level of quality we normally associate with the FOX Sports brand is indeed present in 3D Slam Ping Pong, an intriguing and ultimate fun timekiller.   Features:   Multiple difficulty levels  Quick, Deuce or Rally Mode   We know, you expect a game entitled 3D Slam Ping Pong to be boring. You moved past Pong, what, twenty years ago? Well, there's a reason that ping-pong is one of the most popular table games in the world, from China to the dorms: it's deliriously simple. And Sorrent's ping-ponger captures that simplicity, adds some good challenges, and comes up with a slick, addictive game.   The set-up is simple. You're on one side of the table, the computer -- represented by a small red triangle -- is on the other. While not the most stunning visual choice, it certainly keeps things clean. And when the ball starts flying across the table, you'll be grateful you don't have a graphic of a little man to worry about.   The goal is to rally the ball back and forth, hoping to make the computer miss. Expertly crafted AI insures that the computer is no push-over, but it's also no Forrest Gump, either. While keeping your eye on the ball and the triangle, use the 4, 6, and 8 buttons to smack the ball back whether it's coming from the left, center, or right. This takes some time to get used to, but hang in there.    Use the touchpad to return the ball in a specific direction, and with extra juice, if needed. The longer you hold on the touchpad, the more powerful your shot, but be careful. Get greedy with power shots and the AI will slam a fast one at you. Before you can take your finger of the touchpad and go for the number pad, you will have ceded a point.   The three modes offer great challenges. Deuce Mode, perhaps the most fun, starts the game with 20 points on each side. First person to pull a two-point lead wins. Quick Mode raises the value of each shot to two points, rather than one. Rally Mode is frustrating for beginners, but once you get the hang of 3D Slam Ping Pong, give it a go. In Rally, the AI never misses a shot. You only score if you are able to volley back.  Essentially, in 3D Slam Ping Pong, what you see is what you get. A simple little title that offers just a good game of ping-pong, nothing more -- which is fine with us. The different modes add a lot of replay to the game, so don't worry about get bored too quickly. The AI will keep you on your toes. Another quality Sorrent release.", "date": "Apr 14, 2004"}
