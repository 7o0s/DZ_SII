You know about Burton, right?  His movies, in the form of Batman, Nightmare before Christmas, or Beetlejuice always have an unmistakable visual style  this guy was clearly raised in and of the darkness.  Usually, the other elements of his films are on the uppity-up as well, although the visuals and quirkiness tend to outweigh most everything else.  Give me a second . . . I'm going somewhere with this.  I'm a firm believer in the recent adage that games are an art form to rival films.  A game doesn't need to have the strongest gameplay in the world, as long as it has a certain sense of style, whether it be through music, artwork, or maybe just plain quirkiness.  Two of my all-time favorites, Ys Book 1 & 2 and Panzer Dragoon fit the bill quite nicely, actually, and boy do I get upset when people deny the brilliance of those games due soley to their simple gameplay.  The fact is that, much as with a film, all it takes for a game to hook and reel me in is the more artistic aspects of the production.  And then I saw Sleepy Hollow, and my opinion wavered.  While it's true that Burton is in top visual form with this movie, the other elements tend to get in the way of things just a bit.  Well, rather, they got in the way enough for me to say, regrettably, after having seen the movie, ~I'm never getting' those two hours of my life back again, am I?~  Apparently, although visual style can save a film with not much else going for it, you run into problems when the other elements of the film get in the way.  In Evolution: World of Sacred Device, the other elements do manage to get in the way of things, unfortunately, and they, at times, form a friggin' road block.  This is what I like about Sting's Dreamcast RPG: the characters, the music, the cool, albeit simple, story, and the creature designs.  This is what I don't like: the game.  Evolution combines awesome artistic elements with problematic gameplay that will turn off people looking for a solid gaming experience.  Some will love it, but most RPGers should either look into that whole PlayStation RPG-flood thing, or wait until next year when the real Dreamcast RPGs arrive. Evolution is the tale of young Mag Launcher, the only child in the legendary Launcher family of adventurers, and his exploits in and about the small town of Pannama.  Years ago, a young girl called Linear Cannon arrived at the doorsteps of the Launcher household carrying with her a letter from Mag's father, Asric Launcher, who was out on an adventure.  The letter requested that Mag look after Linear, and was the last Mag heard of his father.  Since that time, the two children and the family butler Gre Naid (say it real fast!) have lived together, with Mag and Linear going off on archaeological treasure hunts in the nearby ruins, in an attempt to pay back the debt owed by the Launcher family to the Society, a world-wide adventurer's guild.  As the game begins, Mag and Linear are off on one such adventure, but things are about to get a whole lot more complicated, as the 8th Imperial Army arrives in Pannama Town, in search of a legendary artifact known as Evolutia.  It so happens that the Launcher family throughout the generations has been seeking out this very artifact as well; in fact, Mag's father was out in search of Evolutia when he disappeared and sent Linear with the letter to Mag.  Throughout the course of the game, Mag, Linear, and Gre, along with Chain Gun, a pesky female adventurer, and Pepper Box, a sexy foreign adventurer, will clash with the 8th Imperial Army as all try to figure out the mystery behind Evolutia.  You may have noticed that all the main characters have names taken from various forms of munitions (I told you, say ~Gre Naid~ fast!).  No, this isn't a silly translation artifact from Ubi Soft.  Actually, the funny names originate in the Japanese versions, and they fit the characters and the machine-based theme of the game world well (although, Linear Cannon sounds too harsh for the hyper cute and super quiet companion of Mag).  The characters themselves are brilliantly designed and crafted, easily some of the best and most unique characters I've ever seen in a game.  If some kind soul out there would make little dolls and stuffed animals of these guys, I'd be lined up outside Toys 'R' Us the day of their debut.  Thankfully, the power afforded by the DC allows for these guys to be more than just designs.  With exception to a bit of blurriness when viewed up close (something that seems to have been corrected in the sequel), the onscreen representations of the characters are solid, and lend themselves well to polygons.  You'll find animated textures, mostly used for comical facial effects, and inventive realtime antics when the characters call out a spell in battle.  The only complaint I have about the characters is the lack of voice.  Unfortunately, with exception to the shouts and taunts during battles (Ubi Soft has actually kept these parts in Japanese), you'll find no spoken dialogue throughout the game.  Oh well . . . I suppose reading the text isn't so bad, but voices would have added a lot to the game.  This gripe aside, though, the characters are still awesome, and they join the terrific music (by Two Five, the studio that did the music for Grandia), and the excellent creature designs for the monsters as the title's best elements.  I also like the overall control you're given over the characters as you move about the game world and dungeons.  Think of Evolution in this respect as a 60 frames per second Grandia, and you'll have somewhat nailed it down.  You view the action from a 3/4 view, and can move the characters around the game's environments freely, rotating the camera at will.  Best of all, you can jump with the tap of a button.  The game rarely makes use of the jumping for actual gameplay, but being able to do something extra with the characters manages to add quite a bit to the overall sense of control.  The progression of the game follows this general rule: first, Mag and Linear walk around Panama Town, speaking with villagers, buying goods and equipment  partaking in the standard RPG fare.  The two head into the Society building and receive an assignment from Nina, which will have them head off to one of the five ruins in search of an artifact.  You can actually choose which dungeon you're interested in going to, so the game isn't exactly linear.  After assembling a party of up to three, they head off to the ruins, make their way to the top floor, defeat the boss, and head back to the Society with the stolen artifact in hand.  Upon claiming their award money, most of which automatically goes towards playing off the Launcher family debt, the story progresses just a bit, and the cycle repeats.  The dungeons are, clearly, the main area of the game, and they are massive, ranging from ten to twenty floors.  Twisting paths loaded with traps abound, and stepping upon a trap will send characters into blindness or confusion, warp them to different areas of the map, or result in various other effects, some good and some bad.  An on-screen auto map feature makes navigating the dungeons easy, but the later dungeons become tedious after the tenth floor.  I constantly found myself saying ~For the love of God, let this dungeon end already!~  Interestingly enough, the dungeons are randomly generated, so if you leave a given floor and return to it later, you'll end up going through a completely different floor.  Does this help the game out in any way?  I suppose so, but one of the things that helps me to attach to other RPGs is a constant world, something that Evolution doesn't have.  Thankfully, part 2 will feature a mix of the random and the pre-planned type.  Lurking about the dungeons are various enemies that Mag and crew will have to fight in turn-based combat.  These aren't random battles, though, as the enemies are, thankfully, visible ahead of time, although it's usually impossible to avoid an enemy who has his sights set on you.  Once you're in battle, it's basically standard RPG fare, with you and your characters placed on a time line, taking turns in doing various moves.  You can have any given character attack with a standard weapon, defend, or attack with a special skill.  Fighting earns you Technique Points, which can be exchanged for more special movies.  Sting has added a bit of strategy to the battles by using a grid-based positional system, with characters and enemies placed in one of three positions: near, medium, and far.  A character in the near position will unleash stronger attacks, but is more susceptible to damage.  Likewise, a character in the far position unleashes a weaker attack, but is less likely to incur damage.  The positional stuff does work its way into the game system, as some characters can do moves that force opponents into different positions.  Battles are made further interesting through the use of the CyFrame, a mechanical device that attaches to a given character.  Located throughout the Evolution world are parts that can be connected to the CyFrame, and when doing so will give a character special powers.  Mag, for instance, can equip a Boulder CyFrame, which gives him a series of boulder attacks, or he can equip a restoration CyFrame which makes available to him a series of restoration moves.  You can go into a shop in tow and upgrade the CyFrame to include multiple slots and give an individual port more power.  The CyFrame is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game, but it's unfortunate that it's difficult to fully explore the possibilities of the feature due to the game's limited play time.  On the main body of your quest, you'll get through the title in sixteen hours but if you want to fully max out the abilities of a given CyFrame part, you'll have to site around fighting enemies, going in and out of the dungeons multiple times.  I suppose that's not too bit a deal, as to get everything in Final Fantasy VII, I had to often build up my character by fighting battle after needless battle.  However, in Evolution, backtracking in order to level up is a common occurrence, as it's used even during the main quest!  I wasn't able to get past a single boss without going back into the dungeon and leveling up my character  and this was despite my having fought and defeated every single enemy on every single floor of the dungeon.  The last boss is the worst culprit, as I was forced to level up Mag and crew around 8 levels!  This problem in balance is actually the biggest thing holding the game down, but when combined with other problems such as the cheapness of the bosses (why do they, out of nowhere, suddenly start making two consecutive movies?), and various little difficulties in movement on the over world (I still have difficulty opening treasure boxes and initiating conversation with people), and you'll think twice about actually playing the game.  And, of course, I have to mention the translation somewhere.  Ubi Soft has given us a very plain English adaptation of the game that rarely goes beyond the most plain text imaginable.  And I'm not even going to mention the few textual bugs here and there.  Beyond all this, though, even if the balance was perfect, the bosses weren't cheap, and Ubi Soft had provided us with a godly translation, the game would be only average at best, as it never makes an attempt at going into the levels of storytelling reached by Grandia.  For the most part, the game sticks to the dungeon  story  town cycle, the only exception being the final 3 or 4 hours, which blend the dungeons and story parts nicely.  In fact, the last few hours of the game look eerily similar in style to Grandia.  Hopefully, Evolution 2 will feature more of these sequences, as opposed to a system that tries to wholly separate gameplay from story-telling.  In the end, I'm personally glad that I played through Evolution, as I've now been introduced to the fantastic characters and the cool little story that started off their adventures.  These characters and the simple story that surrounds them will possibly keep you playing for a while and anticipating the sequel, but the major problems get in the way enough that I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  As a 1st RPG, Evolution is moderately good  certainly a lot better than I remember of Beyond the Beyond from early 1996, but my score below reflects the fact that it will be topped in no time.  - Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 15, 1999"}
