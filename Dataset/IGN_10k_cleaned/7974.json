Do you like Tri-Peaks Solitaire? Then there is no reason in this vast cosmos that you will not be completely thrilled with this devilish addictive hybrid of the two: Jewel Quest Solitaire. The game combines the winning mechanics of Tri-Peaks, but infuses every moment with Jewel trimmings and trappings. Between rounds of solitaire, you play a not-so-mini version of Jewel Quest, filling in the game grid with gold squares by matching trios of gems.   It's the way that these two halves are connected that makes Jewel Quest Solitaire such a winner.   In the Tri-Peaks segment, you are changed with assembling a series of cards in either ascending or descending order, such as J-Q-K-A-2-3-2. As you link cards, you turn over the cards hidden beneath them. When you reach a dead-end, you can pull a new card from a stock deck at the bottom of the screen and hope against hope it reignites a trail of linked cards. For every card you link in the field without going to the deck, you increase your point multiplier. If you get on a run, you can send your score into the stratosphere.   Undoubtedly, you'll notice that instead of using suits, the cards are emblazoned with gems. If you can link up a sequence of cards with the same gems, you'll not only earn even more points, but you'll also drop those gems into the small Jewel Quest grid at the bottom of the screen. If you drop three or more in a row, the squares behind the jewels turn gold, just like a regular Jewel Quest game. So, you now have two goals while playing: Link the cards, and turn the mini field as golden as you can.   When you finally clear the cards, the game switches now to full-blown Jewel Quest. The formerly small grid fills the screen. You now have a specific number of moves (instead of a timer) to turn the rest of the grid gold. If you manage to finish the puzzle, you earn a fat bonus. If not, there is no real penalty, you just move on to the next screen of cards. I was pleasantly surprised to find out this wasn't some hobbled version of Jewel Quest, as I had previously feared. Each module transitions back and forth extremely well so at no point did I get bored of doing the same thing.   As you play, you uncover wild cards that let you bridge a gap in the cards without going to the deck. When used wisely, these wild cards can also extend your incredible streaks and increase point multipliers. You have wild cards that increase your multipliers by three, five, or seven. Some wild cards affect the deck, such as showing you the top card without having to turn it over and disrupt your streak. But not all of these cards are cherries -- one wild card, for example, negates the effects of previous wild cards.   Jewel Quest Solitaire is divided into four chapters. Each chapter has eight puzzles. But don't be fooled by thinking you will blow through those 32 puzzles in an hour. As you progress, the card layouts get tougher, filling the screen with swirling patterns and oddly-shaped stacks. As you play, you're constantly bombarded with the choice of continuing a run with one gem family or using a card that sits on a pile of overturned cards to see what new options it opens. I really liked the puzzle designs, as I felt there was a real rhythm to the way you are supposed to link cards. There are multiple solutions for each puzzle, but there's always one that really gilds the Jewel Quest field.   Between puzzles, you get pieces of a story. The tale follows Percy Pack's mysterious journey through the jungles of Mexico. It's a nice addition for those that want to take the time to read it. After you play through a puzzle in the story mode, you can play it over and over in the ~Just Cards~ mode. And, yes, I actually did go back to replay some boards after I finished them because there were definitely a few I knew I could do better at.   And, for the record, I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson w810i.  I actually liked Jewel Quest Solitaire more than Jewel Quest 2 for a number of reasons. The game gets difficult, but never mean. The links between the card game and the JQ puzzle fields make perfect sense and when you're about four stages into the game, everything just clicks. There are multiple solutions to the puzzles, just some are better than others and if you pay attention, you'll soon discover (and maybe master?) all of the game's nuances. The game looks great, too.If you are a fan of either game that makes up the whole of Jewel Quest Solitaire, there is absolutely no reason not to download this game.", "date": "Jan 26, 2007"}
