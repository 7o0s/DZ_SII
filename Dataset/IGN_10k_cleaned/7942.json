It's a word that hints at hiding. Shielding your true self. Protecting your secret identity. But there's no obscuring the truth of what this game is  Totally Spies! 2: Undercover is shallow, superficial and more than slightly senseless. It's a loosely connected collection of mini-games that represents a poor handling of a license, one that could have lent itself to a much more solid style of gameplay. You'll want to totally stay away from this spy game  its cover is blown.    Alex, Sam and Clover are three young and worldly women. They've traveled the Earth on all kinds of adventures, as part of their double lives. On the surface, they're three normal students. But secretly, they're three super spies. In Totally Spies! 2: Undercover, it's more globetrotting treks for the trio. Five separate ~episodes~ see the girls repeatedly called into their secret agent headquarters, given mission details and equipment, and sent out to save the day.    The trips to HQ are a problem, as right from the start these spies are exposed as too slapdash. Cutscene story sequences are conveyed with still shots that appear to be frame captures from the Totally Spies cartoon show, and these are overlaid with talking head character graphics and dialogue. Spotty dialogue. Sometimes there are mountains of nonsensical text to scroll through. Other times, none at all  leaving you to just imagine what's being said as the frames parade from one to the next.    Besides introducing each episode, said frames are also meant to tie the ensuing mini-games together. These, too, are spotty. The mini-games form the total gameplay of Totally Spies, and are certainly varied in concept. The execution is universally poor, though. Whether the current challenge is chasing down a speeding vehicle, using a soldering iron for a slightly more advanced take on Connect the Dots, or tapping into your inner Snake to infiltrate a fortress in Metal Gear Solid style, the fun just isn't there.    The designs are just too shallow. None of them is fleshed out enough to really become engaging  each one is either over too quickly or too simplistic in how it plays. One early mini-game has Alex being chased by a gigantic, twisting tornado through a debris-filled public park. It's an impressive scenario with an interesting premise, but you'll be disappointed in how it plays  all you do is hold down the D-Pad to keep Alex running to the right, and every 20 seconds or so you turn around and fire a blast of air at the trailing twister. Five shots and it's over. That game is done. And in the time it took you to shoot the cyclone those five times, you will have heard the same piece of background music cycle over itself at least ten times more.    The soundtrack is another let-down in this spy kit. Each song seems looped after only a very short duration, like a cell phone ringtone that keeps repeating itself every 30 seconds. The effects work is equally lacking. With a potential to capitalize on the main characters' Valley Girl speech through voice clips, the game has none. Only generic exclamations of ~oof~ and ~ouch~ when damage is taken.    There are two different versions of Totally Spies! 2, one on the Game Boy Advance and the other on Nintendo DS. The games are not direct twins, as some other doubly-released titles are on the two sister systems. But they vary very rarely in most elements, really only seeing true difference in graphics and some instances of gameplay control.       Everything's 2D on the GBA, of course, but the DS edition brings 3D visuals into several of its mini-games. The extra D doesn't help. Any increase in interest brought by the added dimension is subtracted by other faults, such that both versions of the game end up with the same sloppy level of visual design. Totally Spies appears totally rushed, with some elements that look like they must have been whipped up through five minutes of taxing work in MS Paint. It's a graphical disaster.    The gameplay control differences are mostly stylus-centered, as several mini-games were clearly designed with the DS touch screen in mind. Those games are still in place on the GBA, but with the D-Pad and A Button simulating the stylus. The DS build gets a slight nod for being more intuitive in this area, but it's not nearly enough to salvage this failed mission. The Totally Spies license is one that could be adapted into a fun and focused video game experience. It's got the potential to be interpreted into an action design, or a fresh take on the stealth genre. But it definitely doesn't work as a tossed-together mash-up of mini-games. This game is a mess, in pretty much every aspect. Its presentation is lacking. It has graphical issues. Its sound is annoying and the mini-games themselves just aren't much fun. Totally Spies! 2: Undercover is a compromised agent. The government has disavowed all knowledge of the game's existence, and you should too.", "date": "Jan 18, 2007"}
