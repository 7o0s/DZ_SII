Are you ready to RIDE?! No, no you're not. If you're reading this and are thinking about purchasing this game, chances are that you don't actually own a Harley, and most likely, have never owned a Harley, or you'd be out on the road jumping dead dogs in Sturgis instead of purchasing PC games about jumping dead dogs in Sturgis. But the offer is tempting -- a chance for you to try out some of the hottest Harley Models in some classic environments like Sturgis and uh... the beach, while only spending a cool $20 of your valuable cash. Don't be fooled -- despite the fact that this is a sequel, and despite the fact that this title is definitely an improvement over the original Race Across America, Wheels of Freedom is one of the lamest racers of the past few months.  That's not to say there aren't some high points, however. You've got to admit that Wheels of Freedom is the best game name of 2000, hands-down. Whatever Alice, who cares Tony Hawk, and Ground Control my butt, Wheels of Freedom is so blazing that you can't help but think of the American Flag in ten-mile an hour winds, under an orange sunset, on top of Mt. Rushmore, or at least an elementary school. It's almost inspirational enough for you to start a cult with, and definitely strong enough make you take a second look at the packaging. Notice the peekable window showing off the free bandanna? I thought so. Don't be fooled by good marketing, though -- the only influence that department had on the design of this title was to give the developers King-sized Kit Kats and copies of Bring it On when deadlines were met.  I don't want to make it sound like G2M simply made more levels and plopped them onto the original engine -- the team actually tweaked the game around quite a bit, giving you more options, a full online component, and a free structure that allows you to choose what sorts of levels you want to play, and when. You've got four sets of courses to choose from, and each course has three different modes: Open Road Challenge, Poker Run, and Checkpoint Rally. Open Road is a straightforward race through a variety of environments, Checkpoint Rally is a sort of Motocross Madnes style romp over an open area, where you've got to follow your trusty arrow to the next checkpoint on the map, and Poker Run is... well, odd. It's the closest a racing game has come to emulating the last-level labyrinth of a shooter. Take the Checkpoint Rally mode, replace the spinning Harley checkpoints with spinning card icons, throw in a poker game, and you've got yourself a perfect way to extend the life of a game. You get a card for every checkpoint you hit, and at the end of the race, you receive a certain amount of points for your hand (you get to do one draw after the race), as well as for the place you finished the race in. The trouble is, most of the time you're stuck competing with some pretty high hands, forcing you to replay a race again and again and again and again until you get the right set of cars. Fun!  While it sounds like you've got a lot of options, in fact you can breeze through races pretty quick on Easy, and fairly fast on Medium, as long as you take into account the crazy physics/AI lameness. The bikes tend to ride like you're racing icebergs in Antarctica, bouncing and floating along the landscape, and sliding around like dizzy children. The powerslide feature usually spins you much farther than you'd like, bringing you down to a near-halt, and the Nitro feature only serves to pop you into an out-of-control wheelie that more often than not flips your bike completely over. The AI itself is erratic at best -- your competitors are just as likely to race into a pole as they are to cut you off near the finish line, and usually your coming in at first or third place has very little to do with how you actually performed in a race. The differences between the bikes are hard to figure out in terms of gameplay, though the extended character and bike color options are a welcome addition to the game. The courses themselves, while nicer and filled with a few more tricks (jumps, multiple paths), are still far below your average racing game, and tend to bore you before they frustrate you. The new additions, however, are high on the ugly meter, and do very little to convince you that new options like Checkpoint are even worth the bother, especially if it means running around one-textured hills for two minutes.  The Multiplayer game has been combined with GameSpy's Arcade, which should make finding other gamers a breeze -- that is, if there were any gamers online to play with. I couldn't find a race to save my life, and was stuck with the local boys over LAN. I wanted the best, and I got Tal and Dan.  Thank god the sound and music is still the same, with chunky muffler noises, revs, and inane grunts making the experience soft on the ears, if not on the eyes. The graphics themselves are an improvement, but still lack the sort of level design, architecture, and layout to actually make you happy in that special, special way. Keep your eyes closed however, and you can still imagine yourself cruising down the open road, wind in your hair, sunglasses on your face, and sweaty leather suctioning onto your warm butt cheeks.  Wheels of Freedom is an improvement, and by improvement I mean that you actually get a bandanna in the box instead of a special Harley Davidson writing pad this time around. If you're a Harley fan, and if you're the sort of person who purchased the KISS Popsicles back in the day and still have them in your freezer twenty years later because they're ~a valuable part of any collector's collection,~ then you should run out and buy this game pronto. If, perhaps, you enjoy spending your money on things of value, such as say... well, any other game on the market, than you should probably take the twenty bucks and get yourself Superbike 2001, or at least something a little more valuable.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
