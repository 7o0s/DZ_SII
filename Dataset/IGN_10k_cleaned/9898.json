After having snatched the handheld fighting crown with the outstanding King of Fighters for NeoGeo Pocket Color, SNK once again steps into the ring to show the competition what a good fighting game is all about. The genre of choice, this time: weapons-based 2D fighting. Based on SNK's long-running line of arcade fighters, Samurai Shodown 2 is an addictive masterpiece that fighting fans shouldn't pass up.Features 14+ characters. Three play modes. Two technique modes. Three difficulty settings. Customizable battle settings. Play head-to-head via the link cable. Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color. Collect cards and trade them with other players.The GameUp to two players select from a group of fighters (or let the computer choose), including samurais, ninjas, magicians, and knights. The initially available 14 fighters are: Asra, Taizan Morosumi, Charlotte, Shiki, Kazuki Kazama, Sogetsu Kazama, Haohmal, Genjuro Kibagami, Nakoruru, Rimnerel, Hanzo Hattori, Galford, Ukyo Tachibana and Yubei Yagyu. Each character has his/her own unique fighting style, but all of them either use swords, enlist the help of spiritual animals, or are masters of projectile attacks. In a departure from most fighting franchises, Samurai Shodown lets players determine whether their fighters are motivated by Evil or whether they believe in chivalry. Depending on which personality you choose, the characters' special moves differ. For example, only the chivalrous Taizan can pull off a storm attack -- and only his treacherous counterpart can unleash a flaming blast.Although Samurai Shodown looks and plays similar to King of Fighters, the controls are a bit different. Most attacks are executed via the stick and the A button. Quickly tapping A brings about a weak attack whereas pressing it longer unleashes a strong blow. The B button is primarily used for fakes, but some characters can also execute flying kicks while in the air. In addition to a host of regular and special attacks, Samurai Shodown also features plenty of combo moves that are executed through simple button combinations. Each successful hit during a bout fills up the so-called ~Rage Gauge~ at the bottom of the screen. The fuller the gauge, the more powerful the characters' attacks. When the gauge is full, players can also use up the energy to cause a ~Rage Explosion~ that stuns opponents and follow it up with a powerful flash attack. The built-up rage can also be used to unlock new special moves.When certain conditions are met (eg beating a chained boss monster), players receive a card depicting a new special skill. Collected cards can then be equipped to boost the respective character's attributes or add special moves. To give fighting fans even more incentive to hook to units together for link-up gaming, there is even a special collection mode that lets players trade cards with each other.Unlike most other handheld fighting games, Samurai Shodown not only has responsive controls, but plenty of speed to boot. Evading projectile attacks and blocking at the right moment is key to survival, as are quick counters and aerial attacks. The gameplay is so involving, you'll quickly forget that you're looking at a tiny handheld screen.The graphics are equally excellent. Samurai Shodown not only features beautiful Japanese backdrops ranging from temples to forest scenes, but each stage also exists in two variations. Sometimes, a second round is fought at night in front of a beautiful dark-blue sky, at other times, the same stage is reduced to rubble the second time around. As with King of Fighters, all characters are only two-colored (the color depends on the personality you selected). But it's easy to forgive this limitations since they're so well-animated, complete with weapons trails and impressive special move graphics. The music perfectly complements the scenery. At times, it only consists of a lone flute tone (you'll have to imagine that it sounds like a Shakuhachi -- since everything pretty much sounds the same on NeoGeo Pocket), at other times the music picks up and pounds away with a steady beat.The King of Fighters will have to scoot over a little bit on his throne and make room for the Emperor. I have a hard time deciding which game  I like more, King of Fighters or Samurai Shodown. If I had to pick one, I'd probably go for Samurai Shodown, mainly because I prefer the samurai and ninja characters and the ancient Japanese settings. If you've been waiting for a fast fighter with a large selection of characters and a tried-and-true fighting system, Samurai Shodown 2 is your game. Link up two NeoGeo Pockets and you'll never stop. Great game.", "date": "Jul 21, 1999"}
