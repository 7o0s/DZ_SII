Stepping to the plate is Acclaim's All-Star Baseball 2003.  Last year, ASB for the PS2 and GameCube had some major bugs.  The once dominant franchise (the N64 series was amazing), lost ground to 3DO's High Heat.  Some serious changes were needed if Acclaim expected to rise to the top once again.  The fielding and baserunning bugs had to be addressed, as did the ratio of home runs.  The overall feel of ASB last year just wasn't right.  Acclaim took the challenge seriously and has come out with one of the best baseball games in years.     FeaturesFully licensed by the MLBPA  Rosters accurate to within a few weeks (Shinjo is on the Giants, as he should be)  All Major League stadiums, plus classic and fantasy stadiums  Hundreds of motion-captured animations  Deep Franchise Mode that tracks player stats for up to twenty seasons  Three-man broadcast booth with Thom Brennaman, Steve Lyons, and Bob Brenly  Player cards that can unlock stadiums and special teams  Hall of Fame team featuring some of the best players in baseball history  Massive expansion team options allowing you to create your own team and take them to the World Series  Gameplay  ASB 2003 is one of the best baseball games I've played, and I've played them all.  Acclaim didn't do a massive overhaul to gameplay mechanics with ASB 2003, but they made a few tweaks and performed some major AI revisions to make ASB a World Series champ again.     The controls are intuitive and will be second nature by the end of your first game.  A, B, Y, and X throw to the different bases, with the white button throwing to the cutoff man.  The batting cursor represents both a contact zone and a sweet spot.  Putting good wood on the ball will give it more pop and greatly increases the changes of hitting a dinger.  You can easily switch from a contact swing to a power swing.  The power swing removes the contact zone, meaning you must hit the ball in the sweet spot to make contact.  Many major leaguers guess at the pitch and location in hopes of getting a better swing on the ball.  In ASB, you can be just like your favorite big leaguer.  Guessing the pitch type correctly increases the contact zone, guessing the correct location of a pitch increases the power zone.  The batting interface is easy to use and offers a lot of player control to allow for fly balls, grounders, pulling balls, or hitting to the opposite field.  And the game allows for drag bunts, so you can utilize Ichiro to his fullest.   Base running is controlled primarily with the left and right trigger.  Left trigger sends runners to the next base when the ball is in play, and right trigger returns them to their previous base.  By using the D-pad, you can control specific runners.  Swiping a base is performed with the D-pad and the Y button.     As is standard with most baseball games, a fielding cursor appears when a ball is put into play, showing where it will land.  It can be a bit confusing at first since this is not an indicator of where you should stand, but where the ball will actually hit the ground.  After a few flubs, it's easy enough to know you need to be a little in front of the circle.  The camera switches to some good angles once the ball is put into play.  I've yet to misplay a ball due to the camera.   And that ball is quite lively.  Fast balls go by in the blink of an eye and a sharply hit liner follows a realistic trajectory.  Balls zip past infielders, forcing you to react quickly if you hope to rob Nomar of a single.  Players have a variety of throwing speeds, from quick, hard throws across the diamond, to underhand tosses from the pitcher to the first baseman.     Fielders can be moved to fit specific situations or batters.  Each batter has a hit chart, showing their hitting tendencies.  A-Rod is a pull hitter.  So you'll want to shift your infielders and outfielders to the left as that's where he's more likely to hit the ball.  Players fielding stats seem accurate as Ichiro throws bullets to third base and Russ Davis throws gopher balls into the dugout.   Players interact with the ball nicely.  There are balls that bounce off the heel of a fielder's glove, or hit off the pitcher's leg, or go right at the third base coach (who must scramble out of the way).  Catches run from mundane pop-ups to diving snares to very, very rare over the wall grabs.  Acclaim Studios Austin put a lot of time into making certain the game had a large variety of realistic plays and it pays off.  The game is just plain sweet, with lots of ~oooh~ moments.     A.I. (not by Steven Spielberg)  The meat and potatoes of any baseball sim is the gameplay.  AI errors and graphical glitches take away from the experience and can sometimes be too frustrating to ignore.  While ASB 2003 is not free of such problems, they are very minor and rarely will cost you a game.  Let me assure you that this game is excellent.  Before dissecting every piece of this game, we're gonna get the AI problems out of the way, because, as I said, they are minor when compared to the goodness that is ASB 2003.   Having played quite a bit of ASB 2003, I have to admit that I didn't run across bugs very often.  No baseball game is going to be totally free of AI glitches, but Acclaim has cleaned out the majority from last year.  Most of the problems are actually from the graphics, with some poor object detection.  I'll get to those a little later when we discuss graphics.  The most notable error I came across dealt with baserunning.  Derek Jeter hit a double with a man on first.  The lead baserunner stopped at third, but Jeter passed second base and kept going for third.  Even after I threw the ball to third base, Jeter didn't attempt to turn back, resulting in an easy out.  This doesn't happen often, in fact, it only happened twice in over 40 games.  And that was the worst of any AI glitches I came across.  Not bad.  Especially when compared to the problems of ASB 2002.     One other big glitch happened on a ground ball.  The ball appeared to head into the outfield, but then suddenly was in the pitcher's hand.  This only happened once, but was still aggravating.  However, I can't really fault Acclaim too much as it was a singular occurrence.  Basically, if you play enough ASB 2003, you'll see some AI bugs, but they won't be too often or too terrible to forget about.   Something that is not a glitch, but is a bit annoying is how quickly plays end.  A play will end even if the pitcher doesn't have the ball.  So a runner may be stopped at second base and the third baseman may be about to throw to first for no reason other than that you pressed a button and suddenly it cuts to the next batter stepping to the plate.  It's not a big deal when it happens on plays that are essentially over, but occasionally it happens when you have a throwing error, denying the base runner the ability to advance one base.   Lastly, one thing that seems very consistent is a lack of pickoff attempts.  The AI just doesn't seem to care that Ichiro has a big lead off first.  The computer never, and I mean never, throws to first in Rookie or Veteran mode.  This makes it a little too easy to steal bases.  Even Giambi stole second twice in one game.  Pickoffs are an important part of the defensive game, and to not have them chips away slightly at the realism ASB is trying to portray.   While there are some minor blips, overall ASB is just plain fantastic.  With the exception of the Rookie difficulty, every game felt like real baseball.  Some games were low scoring affairs and some were slugfests.  Pitching isn't as simple as just throwing a ball at the plate.  You've got to outthink the batter.  Consequently, the AI pitcher will try and outthink you.  It's a nice little chess game that mirrors true baseball very well.  For instance, throwing a bunch of fastballs will only get you hurt.  However, throwing two fastballs and then tossing out a changeup low and away will often have the batter swinging too early.  You know, the changeup can be the nastiest pitch in baseball if used properly.   The AI is solid, minus those minor glitches.  As I said earlier, this is near the top of the all-time list.  What's really nice is that after so many games, I haven't gotten tired of playing, and ASB still manages to throw in a few surprises.  With passed balls, broken bats, players charging the mound, and Wrigley faithful throwing back a visitor's home run ball, ASB has plenty of nice touches that bring you right into the game.      Modes o' play  ASB 2003 features a variety of game modes to keep you coming back for more.  Along with the standard exhibition game and season mode, ASB features the best and deepest Franchise Mode to date.  Because Franchise mode is so cool, we'll deal with it separately.  Here's a quick rundown of the other modes:Quick play - Two randomly selected teams duke it out in an exhibition game.  Exhibition - Play against the computer or a friend in a single game to decide the fate of the world.  All-Star Game - Play as either the NL or AL all-stars in an all-or-nothing game.  Season -  Play a season (with customizable length) as your favorite team.  Make trades, deal with injuries, and pull rising stars up from the minor leagues.  Series - Screw the season and start in the playoffs with your favorite team.  Expansion - Create your own expansion club to be used in the other modes of play.  Warning: The first season as an expansion team is very tough.  Batting Practice - Get your groove on in the batting cage.  Hone your swing so you can sock the ball in your next game.  Home Run Derby - Smack the cover off the ball in a battle for the most dingers.   Trivia Game - Enter one of three setups (Classic Baseball, Home Run Derby, or Speed Game) and face a friend answering baseball trivia to drive in runs.  Franchise Mode  By far ASB's best feature, and the one that makes it stand out this year above the others is Franchise Mode.  Franchise mode tracks stats accurately over twenty seasons.  It's one thing to survive a single season, but handling minor league players, making trades, and balancing your franchise budget is a whole 'nother ballgame.  This is the best baseball Franchise Mode on any console to date.     As your season progresses, other teams will be very active, trading players and signing free agents.  There are tons of GM moves, helping to keep a lot of teams in contention.  You can only play 162 game seasons, unfortunately, but you can simulate games to avoid having to play all 162 to complete a season.  Injuries are about as common as in the big leagues and the severity of ailments range from minor ankle sprains to season-ending injuries.   The end of the season brings about a plethora of awards.  Gold Gloves, Silver Sluggers, MVP, Cy Young awards and more are included.  I've always despised games without seasonal awards.  And ASB has them all, which is satisfying.  Especially when you manage to win a few.  ASB will actually track the number of awards members of your team have won over the franchises history.  Truly awesome.   Player cards  Like Madden, ASB features trading cards.  Earn points by performing certain tasks on the field and trade them in after the game for packs of cards.  Players, stadiums, Hall of Famers, and the Development Team are featured on the cards.  Collecting different combinations of developer cards unlock new stadiums and teams.  Here's a few examples of the tasks you can perform and the points you earn:  Point list  2 Stolen bases from same player 1 point  6th RBI for same batter 2 points  Hit for the cycle 10 points  10 Strike outs 5 points  Shutout 10 points  No hitter 50 points  Perfect Game 100 points    Graphics  ASB is one nice-looking baseball game.  The models are mostly accurate, with Mo Vaughn looking much thicker than pencil-thin Randy Johnson.  While the faces aren't always smooth, they generally represent the players accurately.  Ichiro is instantly recognizable.  So is The Big Unit, who looks like a carbon copy of the real thing on the mound.  There are wrinkles in the uniforms and plenty of accessories.  Barry Bonds is outfitted with his elbow armor and Shinjo has his armbands.  Acclaim paid attention to the little details other games may neglect.   While the animations for ASB are not silky smooth, they get the job done.  Sometimes players won't set their bodies correctly when they throw, forcing them to make odd-looking arm motions.  For the most part, the game looks good, with speed appropriate to baseball.  Players adjust their gloves, check their bats, and tap their toes in the batters box.  You'll even catch pitchers wiping their brow from time to time.  All of this helps add to the overall feel of the game.  There's a bit of flicker when you're in the batters box, but it's not enough to distract you from the game.     There are nice touches aplenty here.  Umpires signal safe and out calls as well as foul and fair balls.  They actually stand in their correct positions and kneel to judge a close play at a base.  The first and third base coaches are also fully animated, motioning for base runners to slide, hold up, and head for home.  Pitchers point up at fly balls and outfielders wave each other off.  And, of course, mascots dance on top of the visitor dugout between innings.   The attention to detail needs to be noted yet again, because it really is impressive.  Being an A's season ticket holder, I can assure you Acclaim captured the Coliseum perfectly.  The placement of ads, even the color of the ads, is spot on.  There are yellow retired jerseys painted on the walls and even Valuestar hoops in the gaps in the outfield.  I don't think a baseball game has ever captured so much peripheral detail so well.  Another of those you didn't need to do this, but man am I glad you did additions are the planes which fly over Shea Stadium.  Another touch I noticed (and you seem to notice new things all the time) were the K's being placed on the stadium wall by the fans as Mark Mulder struck out more and more Mariners.  The atmosphere of this game is simply outstanding.   Now, it's not all good.  In fact, there's some rather ugly things in ASB.  Object detection is very poor.  Balls will be scooped up even though they appear to the side of the player's glove.  A lot of the plays at the bases look wrong.  Often tags on stolen bases come too early, with the glove swiping before the player ever reaches the base, but the player is still called out.  And sometimes it appears you are out and are still called safe.  If that happened once in a while, that would be okay.  You could just say that that's how baseball is.  But it happens quite a lot.  And while it's actually easy to accept, it's still annoying to watch.     My biggest gripe with the graphics are with collision detection.  There isn't any, really.  Players pass through each other like ghosts and you can even slide through the catcher (but will still be called out).  Didn't we gamers demand player collisions long ago, and haven't we had them in other games?  Yes.  And so there's no excuse to leave it out here.  It really looks silly to have Derek Jeter walk through Roger Clemens to catch a pop up.   Sound  Sound in a baseball game is split two ways.  There are the ambient sounds of the game (crowd roar, crack of the bat, umpire voices) and the play-by-play from the booth.  ASB is meant to be more like watching baseball on TV than down on the field, so many of the ambient sounds are toned down.  The crowd is a sea of similar voices for the most part.  However, they are somewhat intelligent.  They will clap in unison when the home team starts to rally and boo calls by the umpire.  Individual voices will stand out from time to time, which is nice.  Crowds chant for their home team and even for individual stars.  Hits sound real, though broken bat hits sound more like someone breaking some toothpicks in a sound booth than a player actually breaking a bat.  There are no umpire sounds, which leaves a bit of a void, especially when it comes to balls and strikes.  You have to love hearing an umpire shout ~Sttrrrrike three!~  Maybe we'll get that next year.   The play-by-play is handled by Thom Brennamen and Steve ~Psycho~ Lyons.  Brennamen does a good job with the play-by-play and the calls are almost always correct.  Sometimes you get some funky call that doesn't match the gameplay.  Lyons offers color commentary and gets old fast.  Do I really need to know Eric Chavez has improved his stats each of the past three years every time he's at the plate?  It's nice to have comments for a lot of players, but man, you hear about your team so many times it starts to grate on your nerves.  Bob Brenly isn't in the regular games.  He comments on the stadiums during the Home Run Derby.  Seriously, this is pretty much useless filler and an unfortunate waste of Brenly's talents.  ASB is far from perfect, but its successes easily outweigh its deficits.  Anyone who purchases this game, rather than waiting for Triple Play or WSB won't be disappointed.  I can't beam enough over the Franchise Mode and the great off season menu.  The Player Cards are a nice touch and should become a staple of all sports games.  Acclaim should be commended for the amount of care they put into this game.  Last year High Heat was the champ on PS2, but Acclaim may just take over that title with their latest outing.  If you love a good baseball sim and you want to invest some serious time in multiple seasons, this is the game for you.", "date": "Mar 1, 2002"}
