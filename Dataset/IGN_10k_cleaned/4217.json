Since his childhood was so miserable, he's been assigned fairy godparents that will grant him unlimited wishes as long as he adheres to the rules (the standard can't hurt people, alter their thoughts, don anything that would alert the world to their existence, etc.) It's a rather powerful weapon when in the hands of a ten-year-old with an active imagination.    Since the world's rules are so wide open (allowing for almost any sort of gameplay), it makes perfect sense that this Nickelodeon franchise would be turned into a game. However, the bane of most licensed content is that the gameplay is usually unimaginative and not too much fun. Is Fairly Odd Parents able to break the trend? Read on.   The Facts  First time Fairly Odd Parents appears on consoles   10 levels of jumping, climbing and blasting take Timmy Turner through his neighborhood, comic books, videogames, and intergalactic battles  Square off against your nemesis, Vicky   Includes eight unlockable, two minute clips, one full television episode, and an interview with the developer.   Gameplay  It's a dark and dreary day in the Turner household -- Timmy's parents left for the weekend, leaving Timmy under the iron fist of Vicky the babysitter. Hoping to avoid her long list of chores, he asks his fairy godparents to stall her. Unfortunately, Cosmo and Wanda (the godparents) can't reveal their existence to the world -- so in a stroke of genius Timmy wishes there were no rules. This causes a rift in the godparent magic continuum -- bestowing all of Timmy's wishing power onto Vicky. If Timmy doesn't reclaim all the pages of 'Da Rules,' then Cosmo and Wanda will lose their wishing powers forever, leaving Timmy in his own personal hell.    Odd Parents operates in hub world fashion. As Timmy wanders about his room, Vicky will interrupt his playtime with a mean spirited wish. She might wish that Timmy's favorite hero, the Crimson Chin, loses all his hero powers so that Timmy will see how pathetic comics are. It'll be up to Timmy to return Chin to his former super hero self. Timmy will also be forced to cross-dress as a Creme Puff scout so that he can infiltrate their camp and prove that Squirrelly Scouts are the better breed, get sucked into a computer game, shrunk down to microscopic, tub scum cleaning size, and several other adventures based on cartoon episodes.   While the scenarios are diverse and filled with the same humor found in the cartoon, every level is essentially the same -- even though there are different themes. The property allows for a lot of freedom, but most gameplay is based on simple platforming and collecting. If you can handle jumping across chasms, climbing up stairs, and walking across fallen logs, you're more than qualified. To spice up the mediocre jumping is each level's gimmicky trademark wish power. In the comic book level, Timmy gets various cleft super powers (since he's Cleft, Boy Chin wonder) that includes a grappling hook and a blaster. In the comic book world he'll race around in a hover craft and shoot down flying monkeys. He'll have to rely on stealth (avoid walking in flashlight beams) in the squirrelly scout level and practice his tight rope walking skills when he's crossing scummy, nose hair bridges. Even though there are a lot of creative instances (none of them truly original) in each level, you never think, ~Wow, this is really cool.~     It's not that the ideas aren't good -- fault lies in failed execution. Combat is very simplistic. All you have to do is be pointed in the correct general direction and mash buttons to kill enemies. The controls are also sluggish, which can often lead to death because of a missed jump or getting hit by boss attacks. The controls make Timmy seem as though he weighs an extra 50 pounds (or he's wearing iron boots).     Control and mind-numbing puzzles hurt Da Rules, but inane collecting is almost as damaging. Every level sends you searching for stars (five translate into a wish that will help you get past an obstacle). You're usually led straight to these stars by a trail of crowns (the other collectible that can be traded in for lives). Not only are there fifteen of them hidden in plain sight, but whenever you approach them, the stars run away from you. Chasing them is wicked annoying, but after 20 paces the stars are too tired out and stop running (making the chasing pointless). The star gimmick is there solely to extend gameplay -- never a good sign.   Boss battles are also easy (and often don't even rely on you killing it). Most battles require you to hide while the enemy attacks and fire during the rest phase. Some other fights are a little more ingenious, like making a helicopter crash by making sure you keep a meter in a certain position. These encounters never require much skill and are rather anti-climatic.    You can unlock video clips from the cartoon by finding Crimson Chin cards ~hidden~ throughout the levels, but this only extends your time spent in each area by two or three minutes.   Graphics  Fairly Odd Parents takes its art direction straight from the TV show. It's like the game is an interactive extension of the cartoon. The cel-shaded design is very simplistic with minimalist lines and character models look exactly like the show's art. Preview builds suffered from exaggerated character models, but these problems have been corrected to make Odd Parents a cohesive whole (although characters are still set off by some aliasing problems). Animation is pretty basic. There aren't any real complaints except for a general lack of visual flair, but at least the property has been represented correctly.   The camera usually tracks Timmy pretty well. When you need to see things from a different angle, you can rotate the camera to the needed angle. The only real problem is that the camera does get hung up in corners and next to walls.     Sound  The musical score isn't really noticeable unless you're actually listening for it, it gets lost in the various bounces, footsteps, and one liners performed by Timmy and his supporting cast. If you take the time to listen, you'll hear a bunch of orchestral pieces that usually reflect the theme of the level. They also tend to be jazzy remixes of the theme song sans lyrics. The sound effects themselves are fairly minimal and are repeatedly recycled throughout the epic.    Breakin' Da Rules has captured the humor of the TV show in its dialogue; however, the delivery of the lines isn't very good. Most of the time they're missing the same pizzazz and crisp delivery of the show -- often making you wonder if these are decent imitators or just uninspired voice actors.  Fairly Odd Parents is a fun property, but the game isn't. Since it is designed for the younger crowd, puzzles and platforming are all too easy. Anyone who can master the sluggish controls won't have a problem breezing through this title since all the hard to collect objects are in plain sight. It's just sad that the entire game feels so generic and similar when the license allows for so much creativity and freedom. Of course, this dumbed down gameplay is a result of Odd Parents' target audience: kids. Why kids games can't be fun continues to be a mystery to me -- boring, generic, franchise exploiting titles seems to be the bulk of what developers can come up with. At least THQ did a decent job representing the license. Children are the only ones that will get any enjoyment from Breakin' Da Rules, but be prepared to battle control induced frustration.", "date": "Nov 19, 2003"}
