What's funny is every one of those reviews of the N64 version say run -- don't walk -- to pick up the infinitely better PlayStation version of the game. And as I read those reviews, I couldn't help thinking, ~You know, guys, our worlds aren't quite so far apart as you might think.~  Not that Toy Story 2 on PlayStation is a bad game. It's a good game, better than the N64 game by infinity. The gameplay, graphics, and sound all work considerable better on the PlayStation. It's just that this game isn't great. In fact, if you remember the old SNES and Genesis games of the first Toy Story, you'll have an inkling of what to expect with this sequel (both of which were programmed by Disney Interactive's Traveller's Tales). The 16-bit games had fantastic graphics (one of the first non-Nintendo games to use the ACM technique of rendering characters and environments on computers), detailed animation, and a soundtrack that fairly reproduced the film -- they also had stiff controls, poor aiming of your weapon, vague and senseless mission objectives, and (perhaps worst of all) an arduously long and difficult quest that tested the patience of skilled gamers and drove children back to the sandbox. Guess what went wrong in the 32-bit sequel? Gameplay  Toy Story 2 follows the plot of the movie point for point (not that I've seen the movie already -- the game did a fine job of utterly spoiling the film for me by including cut scene FMV directly from the film, without a single frame of exclusive footage). Woody has been kidnapped, and it is up to Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andy's favorite toys to rescue him. Unfortunately for Buzz (and the player), your toy gang is rather incompetent, and so you'll spend most of your time rescuing them and doing menial tasks to win their favors rather than venturing forwards with your quest (kind of makes you wonder why the rest of them even went along on the journey). For instance, Mr. Potato Head seems to lose a limb or vital organ on just about every level, and you'll need to find the missing parts for him to gain a special power so that you can race your buddy RC around the level in order to collect a Pizza Token (which, of course, is your only way of getting to the next level). When I have a friend who is facing a life-or-death peril, I'd like to think my buddies would just give me a fricken' pizza token!  Actual gameplay in Toy Story 2 is pretty solid. Buzz has a number of mascot moves at his disposal (the stomp out of mid-air, the double-jump, the spin move, the ability to grab edges and pull himself up a wall) in addition to his powerful laser weapon (isn't his laser just an LED?). His gun doesn't auto-aim (the game would have been much better served with some of Syphon Filter's control features), but the weapon control is only occasionally bothersome. Buzz himself controls reasonably well, but the problem is that he just doesn't control as well as Mario, and yet he faces a quest that is just as daunting. Everything about the controls feels OK until you try doing something that Mario would have no trouble with. Ledges are always inches out of Buzz's reach, no matter how much you double-jump. In other mascot games (and most specifically Mario 64), the interaction with obstacles is a little forgiving -- if you see a jump that you are fairly confident in crossing, you will likely make it, and even tough leaps of faith often work in your favor. Not here in Toy Story 2. If you miss a ledge by a centimeter, Buzz won't even reach. Thankfully, the game has very few bottomless pits (unlike Mario or Prince of Persia), so very few of those leaps are fatal, but that just makes the game even more frustrating, as you will spend ten minutes getting back up on a ledge to try a leap that you are sure you can make, only to miss by a millimeter again. You'll try over and over again, never knowing that the distance of the leap and the geometry of the thing you are leaping to simply will not allow that leap to work. The game's settings all look manageable, but run Buzz around in them for a while and you'll find that your space commander hero is a flightless bird, a feeble zero.  This makes the game really frustrating, and ruins much of the appeal that this general audience title reaches for (which would have included the rarely pursued pre-teen, female, and older players who help make up the broad-spectrum fan base that a big-name license such as Disney's Toy Story brings with it). When Buzz swings on poles, you'd expect to be able to just stand back and watch him do something neat as he glides from pole to pole (like in Tomba); instead, Traveller's Tales puts the poles at just the wrong distance for Buzz to make an easy leap, so you'll need a lot of fidgeting with the controller and even more luck to be able to grab the next of, say, six or seven poles in a row. Sometimes you'll finesse the controller so much that Buzz will land on the pole backwards, in which case you might as well just drop off and start again rather than trying to right yourself and grab onto a pole in the process. The game's environments are all very nice looking and have a great variety in the terrain, but the vast majority of them are mostly made up of  tough jumps, narrow ledges, and misplaced poles to navigate. Graphics  Graphics are this game's forte, and here Traveller's Tales doesn't disappoint one bit. Comparisons to the N64 version should not even be made -- this luscious game should never be included in the same sentence with that hideous cart. The N64 game looked very, very bad. The PlayStation game looks very, very good.  From the hand-painted 3D crayon-drawn hub that lays out Buzz's mission, to the footprints that trail behind Buzz as he steps out of a puddle of oil, to the splashes and water ripples that ebb away from Buzz as he wades through water, to the hundred-foot tall trees (with bushes of leaves that Buzz can climb through), to the glimmering lighting effects that reflect off Buzz's plastic body, to the moving lawnmower that throws grass in Buzz's face, to the cavernous toy store with Buzz's face plastered on every surface, Toy Story 2 is handsome. Stages are varied and interesting, with five zones (Andy's House and Neighborhood, The Construction Yard, The Toy Store, Al's Apartment complex, and the Airport) represented that have scores of hidden areas and challenges to explore. Pop up is never a problem (baddies do pop in, but they are fairly far away when they do). Just try taking a seven-story fall out of the game's second stage tree to see just how well the game handles its architecture.   Detail is equally impressive in the textures and models. Cups have handles. Water spigot have natural-looking hoses running off of them that are actually polygonal -- Buzz will step up an inch when he walks on one of these thin hoses. Shelves have books. Rafters have poorly-hammered nails sticking out of them. Planes turn their props on the tarmac. Electric sparks run in puddles of water. Look out a window, and you'll see a vast landscape waiting for you (OK, a 2D vast landscape, but it's still very nice). It's all very clever, and the graphics are so good that they give the game almost enough charm to make up for the lack of inspiration in the game play.  The only mar on this smooth surface is the aggravating game's camera, which swings around Buzz at all the wrong times. Those difficult jumps are made much tougher because the game refuses to keep the camera angle that you want to use. Leaps that work best from a side perspective get wrecked by the moving camera (which can be switched to a passive mode, but is still invasive). The camera adjusts slowly, and gets stuck behind walls. It's almost as irritating as the parade of corporate logos (Activision, Disney Interactive, Traveller's Tales, Disney Pictures, Pixar, and the ESRB ~E~ emblem) that have to run their course before you can actually play the game.   Also, while the game is very good looking, it doesn't have the innovative design of the first Toy Story game. It becomes a rather lonely journey sometimes because Buzz is basically alone in his quest -- his helper friends look like the real thing, but don't do anything, and don't come alive. Being a Space Ranger isn't as fun as it would be with a buddy, but this time you don't have your Woody to play with, so the quest isn't as fun. Toy Story 2 could have done well with some of the more innovative levels that the first one had (like riding on the Skateboard Man and scurrying around in a soda cup). While games like Mario or Crash are also one-man affairs, the Toy Story movies are all about being with friends and having fun while you're young, and so without that aspect in the game, it loses appeal. Sound Thankfully, Randy Newman's musical score is not featured at all here (Note to Randy Newman: We hate you too. Sincerely, short people.) Instead, it is a fairly competent and energetic score done by Traveller's Tales' Andy Blythe and Marten Joustra. The music features the same folksy piano chords that underscores the film's more lighthearted moments, and also some brisk, brassy tunes when the game gets into the more suburban areas (the mall store, the airport tarmac). Nothing is too intrusive, and it plays to the film's pace better than the control does.  However, the voice samples are very intrusive. This isn't exactly the fault of Traveller's Tales, as almost all of the voices are grabs from the film rather than lines specifically recorded for the game (the stars are just too big), but the implementation isn't too well-done. Buzz has a number of trademark phrases, but often he repeats one in a matter of seconds. Other characters have phrases like ~Here's a hint~ or ~Hey Buzz!~, but they are sampled poorly, and characters don't speak the actual hint. However, the game is full of little sound effects and minute audio details (like arcade machines that play themselves and softly splashing raindrops) that add a lot to the game experience.Between A Bug's Life, Rascal, and now Toy Story 2, Traveller's Tales has proven that they know the PlayStation hardware stone cold. The graphics engines behind each of these games are so good -- so clean and crisp -- that one would think a good game could be made with such sharp technology and bright graphic designers. But alas, Toy Story 2 proves that all the time in the world could pass, and Disney Interactive would still never get a fully-3D licensed game to actually play really well. Again, Toy Story 2 isn't a bad game in the grand scope of things. It's just that while I was playing, I couldn't help thinking that if I was getting frustrated, and this is what I do for a living, the casual players will have a heck of a time with this one (and sure enough, my sister played the PlayStation last night for the first time since Crash Team Racing came out, just because I had a Toy Story game. Twenty minutes later, she swore off the system). It's a moderately fun game, and it's a fine stocking stuffer, but just don't blame me if your children's dental bill skyrockets from them gritting their teeth.", "date": "Dec 2, 1999"}
