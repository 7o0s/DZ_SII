At over $300 million domestic, easily topping ~Matrix Reloaded,~ it seems everybody else certainly has.  Well, now you can keep the quest alive in this Disney Mobile handset game, based on Pixar's monster hit.  But is Finding Nemo the cellphone game to break the string of pooptacular movie tie-in, started by xXx going right on up to this summer's Hulk.  Features: Find Nemo, fool! Three levels of difficulty  Well, allow us to answer that question right away with an emphatic ~no.~  Regretfully, Finding Nemo is another rushed cash-run, eager to hitch its wagon to the boffo big screener and hope for a little of the flow to go its way.  Finding Nemo deserves none of it, because it is a decidedly un-fun game, torpedoed by difficult control and boring play mechanics.  As Nemo's father, Marlin, you must first take to the deep blue sea and locate the mask that bears the dentist's address.  Once you locate it, you must then hunt down goofy Dory, who is able to read the address.  Along the way, you must use your tail to keep pufferfish and jellyfish at bay.  One quick swipe from your tail is enough to send it across the screen, where it will sit paralyzed for a moment or two.  (And if you're really lucky, it will manage to paralyze itself right in front of the passage you wanted to take.)  No two games are exactly alike, as the game randomly places objects and goals on each map.  However, the enemy placement seems to always be in the same place, so no surprises there.  Finding Nemo's first stumble is the control.  We tried it on a Motorola T720, and Marlin controlled like an oil tanker.  He's slow and unresponsive.  When you hit ~select~ to activate the tail flash, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  (At least you always hear the ~swish!~)  Of course, collision detection doesn't help in the least.  Marlin is pretty big for such a small screen, and he has a tendency to get stuck on coral reefs or on the corners of walls.  You have to position him completely out of the way of walls -- this fish does not like to swim very parallel to things,  The next problem is the aggressiveness of the enemies.  Now, this being Finding Nemo, there's an automatic assumption that this might be geared for kids.  Not with these controls, and not with these fish.  The pufferfish, even on easy, make a direct beeline for Marlin, ready to slam into oblivion.  And unless you throw your fin at just the right moment, you're done.  Worse, though, is just that it's not very entertaining.  Once you compound the game's trouble spots with just a fairly lame play mechanics -- collect this, find that -- you end up with a decidedly average experience.  One that's not made better by so-so visuals and uneventful audio.  The clownfish look fine, and Dory certainly looks like Dory, but the levels themselves are just plain dull to look at.  Sure, a lot of blue occurs naturally in the ocean, but Pixar was able to make it majestic and beautiful.  This is just a whole mess of blues.Oh, I found Nemo alright.  I found him to be a marginal, medicore movie tie-in game, only a few minor steps up the food chain from Universal's insulting Hulk puzzler and In Fusio's bizzaro idea for a on-rails Terminator shooter using the number pad.  The plucky fish and his father got a far better shake on consoles, thanks to THQ's well-made aquatic platformer.  This lame side-scroller has little charm, and I refuse to accept that the game fails because of the tech.  Sure, handsets cannot approximate console visuals -- but at least developers could try to put in the effort.  Just because we're paying four bucks instead of forty doesn't mean we deserve any less.", "date": "Jul 22, 2003"}
