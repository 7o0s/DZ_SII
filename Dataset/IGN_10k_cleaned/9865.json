Ring is loosely based on Richard Wagner's operatic saga Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelungen).  The legendary opera traces the origin and lives of the ancient Germanic gods, and their rise of power through deceit, betrayal and manipulation of earthly beings.  Now that's some heavy stuff that sounds like it would make a kick-ass game, huh?  Even if it is a Myst-inspired point-and-click adventure.  Well, while the opera is seen as one of the cornerstones of German mythology, the game is abysmal at best, with little to no gameplay offered over the course of four CDs, which you'll run through faster than Head Games can release a new Extreme title.   For starters, the story behind the game makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and I don't really understand what it actually has to do with Wagner's opera.  You begin the game as ISH, a ~Metascient~ and one of the last human survivors of an alien enslaved earth that was decimated years prior to the start of the game.  The aliens took away human creativity and expression, so that no form of art was left in the entire world.  Unlike most aliens who would be satisfied by quickly probing you anally, dousing you in rum, and sending you on your way, these otherworldly tyrants offer to grant ISH his freedom if he can perform Wagner's famous opera.  ~Wait,~ you say, ~that's impossible, right?  Didn't the nasty aliens take away all human knowledge of the classic arts when they enslaved the earth?  Why those nasty aliens are just trying to dupe poor ISH!~  Well, it seems a friendly goddess grants ISH special powers that gives him the ability to search through his primal memories and unlock the relics of mankind's ancient cultural arts. You following this so far?  No?  Me either, so let's just move on.  Your vision quest will take you through four chapters, each one focusing on one of the major characters from Der Ring des Nibelungen.  There's Alberich the despotic Dwarf, the mischievous fire spirit Loge, Siegmund the wolf-man, and valiant Valkyrie Brunnhilde.  Although this game is touted as a non-linear adventure, if you don't follow the game's chapters in a sequential order (Alberich, Loge, Siegmund and Brunnhilde), the entire story is thrown into even more of a confusing spin than it already sets itself up to be.  I found myself tripping over backstory that would have come in very handy during other parts of the game to comprehend the legend of the Nibelungen when I started out the first time on Brunnhilde's quest.  And there's hardly any background on the opera itself given during the game, so the player has no real concept as to why these events are played out or what they're supposed to do unless they know Wagner's work well.  Since the Ring is a point-and-click adventure game, you expect a fair number of mind twisters to figure out while you're progressing through the narrative.  Well, as if the story alone wasn't baffling enough, the puzzles themselves are utterly ridiculous.  Most of the so-called 'logic' puzzles involve little more than trail-and-error, and trying to comprehend any logic in them whatsoever will only serve to give you brain cancer at an early age.  Take for example one of the brain-teasers from the Brunnhilde episode.  Why, who doesn't know that it's just logical to point your magic lance at the frozen phoenix so it will burst into flames and melt the icy plains?  This, in turn, will allow the conch shell to fall into the sea reveling the piece of bark below that you'll need for a later puzzle.  I mean, we all learned that one in elementary school, right?  Solving most of the puzzles comes down to nothing more than moving your mouse over every inch of the monitor, looking for a hot spot to click on.  Then it's just a matter of trying every interface option or placing all of your inventory objects over the hot spot.  So, basically, if my dog could click the mouse button at the appropriate time (he can already move the mouse with his mouse), he could finish this game.  Of course, none of this really matters since there's a complete walkthrough included in the manual.  That's right, Cryo and Red Orb decided to just go ahead and tell you how to solve all of the puzzles in the game.  I guess you don't have to use it if you don't want to, but it just seems like they're really tempting you with a little too much information.  Even without looking at the walkthrough (to be honest I didn't even crack open the manual until I had gotten all the way through the game), it took me less than 10 hours to complete the Ring, which is appalling for a modern adventure game.  It's obvious that the Ring's design team spent the majority of their time focusing on the visual and aural aspects of the game ... if you can even call it a true game.  The highly-detailed fully-pannable 3D universe and beautiful, stylized still renders were created by award-winning illustrator Druillet, who also designed the sets and costumes for some of the more recent productions of The Ring of the Nibelungen.  Unfortunately, the beauty is marred because of the horrible compression routine used which leaves nasty artifacts when the pictures begin to move.  And you'll quickly tire of watching the same animation sequence over and over when you travel from one location to another.  Like the graphics, the sound is well produced but slightly contaminated.  The soundtrack itself is rich and full, comprised of pieces from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's recordings of the opera from the late 1950s and mid 1960s.  The big letdown in the sound, though, comes in the almost comical overacting as well as the sparse use of sound effects.  Overall, the graphic and sound work in the Ring is brilliant at times, mediocre at others, but who wants to shell out $40 for a 10 hour CGI movie with a horribly confusing plot?  So, even with its beautiful looks (at least the stills) and emotion-invoking soundtrack, the Ring was a complete travesty when it comes to gameplay and an entire waste of almost half a day of my life ... and I want it back!  I expect a full 10 hour life refund from Cryo within the next 6 to 8 weeks, or at least a half-day pass to Euro-Disney.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jul 21, 1999"}
