And when the ~sequel~ Machiavelli: The Prince came out a few years later, I really got hooked. The combination of a robust trading model with a simple political and economic model really resonated with me. I was one of those kids who made up graphs and tables and crap to squeeze a few extra bucks out of my trade routes. I didn't date much during college.  Merchant Prince is a turn-based economic trading sim where you take on the role of a 14th century Venetian trader. You compete with three other traders in establishing trade routes and exploring the world. But since this is Venice, you can't ignore the religious, political or military sphere either. In fact, you'll use your successes as a trader to broker for political preeminence, either in the secular arena of Doge politics or in the religious sphere of the Vatican. Political power can be used to increase your economic influence, which in turn allows you to buy greater political favor and so on...  The trading aspect is the real strength here. You'll begin with a little bit of cash and some ships. Starting at Venice you'll sail around the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa looking for cities to trade with. Each city has a unique supply and demand model based on the game's eighteen tradable commodities. Your job will be to trade the goods back and forth across the world for a profit. Grab iron in Danzig and trade it for wool in London. Take the wool to Tunis in exchange for silver that can be sold in Venice. Venice offers glass which can be sold in Antioch which offers relics. Relics are really big in Danzig I hear. Anyway, you get the idea.  From there you can use the money in several ways. Either you can invest the money in more galleys or you can spend it buying cardinals or senators. From time to time the Pope or Doge (the political leader) will die. All players who own either cardinals or senators will be able to vote on the replacement. If you get enough votes, you can become the new boss. Both positions have various responsibilities that you can use or abuse as you see fit. While it's been a while since I played the first game, it seems that the computer opponents are a little more ambitious than they have been. Or maybe I just suck.  Those of you who weren't fortunate enough to experience the previous games really missed out. At least until now. TalonSoft has decided to release an update to the original Merchant Prince, creatively titled Merchant Prince II. For the most part, the game is just a repackaging of the original Merchant Prince. Given that the original game is almost impossible to find, that's not too big a criticism. I was however a little confused that this sequel didn't really offer much in the way of new features. At least, that's the way it appears on the surface. Veterans of the original game will be hard pressed to find the improvements and newcomers will almost instantly realize that they're playing a game that's eight years old.  So what are the improvements then? Well first and foremost, the game now runs on Windows. And having witnessed the engineering resource Trent required to get an old copy of Master of Magic to run on his new PC, having a boxed copy of this classic that runs on Windows is no small thing. But as far as I'm concerned that's really the only significant change that's been made to the game.  The actual interface is sad by today's standards. I suppose that we should bear in mind that the game runs on a P166MHz but I still would've preferred a little better access to information in the game. The market screen gives you a look at all the commodities and the prices they're trading at in all the cities you've discovered. This is really great but it would've been useful to include a toggle for the cities you don't have access to. This can be a real pain late in the game when you're scrolling through dozens of cities, a third of which you don't even have access to.  The Venice city screen has other problems. This is where you handle most of the political negotiating. You can take measures to increase your popularity among the locals (by throwing parties and commissioning art) which makes your senators less likely to be bribed away. You can also hire mercenaries to attack cities that are closed to your commerce or you can hire assassins or slanderers to handicap the competition. The screens that all this takes place on are okay (if very dated looking) but my main complaint is in the navigation. I frequently prefer to handle all this stuff at the end of my turn, but when you back out of one area on the Venice screen, you wind up going back to the main game screen. Then you've got to go back to the Venice screen to conduct the rest of your business. It's a small thing, admittedly, but try doing it every turn.  And the actual game map on which you move your caravans and mercenaries is zoomed in a little too close. Being able to pull back and get a better sense of where the cities are situated in relation to each other would've been advantageous. The folks at Holistic have updated some of the other art for the game and included some new music. For the most part, the new art still looks like it could've come from an eight-year old game and the new music, while pleasantly exotic for the first few hours, grew a little aggravating in its repetitiveness. Remember, this is a game that's best when played for hours at a time.  A few editable text files have been included in the game so you can change the names of the commodities (although the actual icons still look the same). You can even change the slanders around to say more abusive things -- like ~Tal reads Redbook~ or ~Dan eats poo.~ You can even change the city names which allows you to change Byzantium to Constantinople in accordance with historical fact. And my advisor said I'd never have a use for my history degree. Shows what he knows.  So we get to the end and what have we got? A really excellent game that's showing its age. At a price of thirty bucks, Merchant Prince II can't compete with the current crop of games -- at least not in terms of production values. It's a shame that more time wasn't spent giving the game the facelift that it needs. That at least might make it attractive enough for players to spend time discovering the great game beneath the surface. As it is this seems like just a cheap reissue. Still, the mechanics of the game have held up much better and as a purely economic sim, it works. You'll just have to put up with the poor appearance if you want to play it.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
