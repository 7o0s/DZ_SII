Bug Riders goes for the latter, giving players the opportunity to do something completely new -- travel to a fantasy world and race flying bugs against other, similar competitors. Sounds like fun, but... ah... I'll talk about that later.  First, here's the plot and all that jazz. The game is set on the planet of Entymion. Rather than run elections to find a new emperor, the throne is given up to the greatest bug rider on the planet. It just so happens that the current ruler, Emperor Leptus, is dying, so the Great Race is to be run, as custom and law requires. This is basically an excuse for a series of races which take place in each of the Five Manors of Entymion. There are six tracks in all, and each is raced in a series of heats. Success in the early heats ensures progression to later ones, where new routes and short cuts open up to make the proceedings increasingly more challenging.   There are a number of characters to select. Each rides a different kind of bug, and each has his or her own weapons, strengths and weaknesses. There are also power-up weapons to collect that are used to blow competing riders out of the sky.   Racing itself is easy. Acting as an accelerator is the player's crop. The more a bug is beaten with it, the faster it goes. A meter, which slowly depletes over time, indicates how much the bug has been caned. The more it's hit, the more the spank-o-meter fills up. Care must be taken not to 'over-crop' the bug, which causes it to stop briefly while the thrash-o-meter completely empties. Then, the caning can begin again. If you're a sadist with a bug fetish, this game's concept will have you creaming the sheets tonight for sure.   Each race is played against a strict time limit. Extra time is gained by flying through blue gates that float above the track, and this has to be done to ensure the player has enough time to actually cross the finish line, regardless of position. I wouldn't mind this if all the other bugs had to do it, but they don't seem to at all. Cheaters.   So with all that out of the way, it's time to talk about the game itself. And I'm afraid this is where it all goes a bit pear-shaped for Bug Riders.   Graphically, it's weak. The 3D engine is fine, but the animation, the bulk of the texture maps and the models themselves just aren't very good. The characters are insipid, and so are their rides. It's all very 1995. The sound isn't that great either, particularly some of the rubbishy effects. I can forgive either of those things if the playability is good. But sadly, it's not to be. Bug Riders has flaws that make its gameplay lamer than a mule with rheumatoid arthritis on a freezing cold, wet day.   The control is awkward. The bugs often don't respond to the joypad and don't fly where you want them to. This probably has something to so with the fact that if the D-pad is not touched, the bug flies around the course on its own. Damn! Had it not been for the fact that the player has to fly through the pesky timer gates to top up the time limit, this could well have been the first videogame that blind people could play. The landscapes and courses aren't particularly good looking or well designed either. All too often the tracks are vague, so you don't really know where you have to go. The crop-o-meter concept is just a bad idea and isn't well implemented -- it's like having a racing game where if you go too fast, the car blows up. Doh! The pace of the game is slow, too. Oh, and the weapons aren't much fun to use.    So there you go. I'm sure you've got the message by now -- if you're after an exciting racing game, look elsewhere.
