The smooth-moving football game makes the most of its GameDay '99 engine, and throws in all of the college bells, whistles, and that undeniable, energizing college spririt.  With fully polygonal, texture-mapped characters, all of the college stadiums, team logos, and finely tuned essentials, such as multiple camera angles, hard hitting tackles, and classic college playbooks, NCAA GameBreaker makes all of the right moves.  As with its rivals, NCAA GameBreaker is packed with lots if gritty minutae, the stuff of any sports game. Different size players, various kinds of tackles, and a few items from last year as well. The now classic Blue Chip Trading is back, enabling you to pick and trade before your season starts, and another feature, create-a-walk-on, is especially enjoyable, providing you a few whimsical hopefuls who could pull through in the clutch or leave your in disgust with his miserable mistakes.  What is certainly one of the most refreshing ideas in the game is the Customize Play function, which does just what it says it does. Of course, this isn't that new, but after a bout of PlayStation NFL Blitz, with its limited plays, you'll really come to enjoy this featue. No pigskin showdown should be without this kind of excellent replay value.  But timing is everything. GameBreaker hits the retail stands about two months after five other football games have already kicked off the season, including two from 989 Studios itself. Most fans have already spent their money on football games, and are now looking into the hockey, basketball, and soccer seasons for more sports goodness. It may be that GameBreaker arrived too late to make a difference in this year's football battle.  NCAA GameBreaker is a one- to eight-player, multitap-compatible game that makes use of the Dual Shock vibration.This game revs up that 'ol college spirit and never comes down. From theminute the game flashes on, the crowd chants , the minute-by-minuteannouncer calls it like it is, the band goes wild, and all of the otheraudio-visual accessories are in place for a constant blitz of collegegoodness.NCAA GameBeaker '99 is an excellent game, with more of the great aspectsthat made last year's game so likeable. It moves great, it feels smoothand fluid, and hard hitting tackles and sensational post-touchdowndances all add to the atmosphere to make this as realistic as possible.The biggest distinguishing factor in your buying decision, however, isthe game's style. If you like GameDay, you'll like this. If you likeMadden, you'll like Electronic Arts' football entre.  It's as simple asthat. And if you like NFL Blitz, well, there's only a little of thatover-the-top gameplay here, but nothing like Midway's arcade monster.(But that wasn't 989's intent, either, this is considered a sim, afterall.)", "date": "Oct 30, 1998"}
