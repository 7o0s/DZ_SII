Especially mobile tennis, which is why it's hard to get excited about SEGA's Virtua Tennis. It bears the name of the series that, in my opinion, completely reinvigorated the boring category of vid tennis -- but due to the limitations of the platform, most of the great strives and game play mechanics that made Virtua Tennis such essential playing on the Dreamcast have been done away with.   Not that you should have really expected the exact same game -- just as it would be unfair of me to review the game as such. All I can comment on is what is there, not what I wished was there with zero regard to the current limits of mobile gaming. And what is there is a very watered down tennis experience that, well, feels a lot like Pong with a few bells and whistles.   Virtua Tennis lets you jump into the career of a faceless player and challenge a series of non-licensed players. Depending on how you fare in matches, you earn points that help you customize your player. For example, you can juice your power, which helps you get the ball over the net with greater shots. Speed gets you around the court faster. Angle helps you really slice the ball cross-court to throw off the competition. Once spent, you cannot take points back and apply them elsewhere, but after a while, I questioned whether any of that mattered. It seemed like even with my improved player, I was doing as well as I was in the very beginning.   Which brings me to the game's difficulty -- and its lack thereof. The opponents within the game don't seem that strong and their actions are predictable. What does make Virtua Tennis hard, though, is seeing the little ball. When the ball goes into the back half of the court, it shrinks to just a tiny collection of pixels. It's easy to miss, especially if your player is moving into it. You can misjudge whether the pixel, uh, ball is in front of the player still or in range for a hit. That gets frustrating.   There is only one button used for taking swings in Virtua Tennis. So, depending on how you are moving and how fast the ball is going, you can drive one over the net or lob it in the air. I appreciate the desire to keep things simple, but there are times when you'll lob an easy one at the computer player and he'll smash it in your face. At times like that, you want only yourself to blame, but Virtua Tennis allows you to be skeptical.   SEGA's Virtua Tennis is done up in 3D, and for the most part, it looks like a Saturn game -- muddy face textures and all. The polygonal players move around alright, although they do seem to float from time to time. There were times when I hit the button to swing near the ball and my player just sorta ~scooted~ toward the ball without moving his legs. The courts are in 3D, too, and they look fine. The game is augmented with audience reactions and some musical loops.  Virtua Tennis isn't a bad tennis game, but it sure isn't exciting, either. The game mechanics are bland, with little control over shots and character customization that doesn't seem to make much of a difference. The 3D work isn't too shabby, but there are certainly polygonal mobile games that look better. If you have an idea in your head of what Virtua Tennis should play like, try to flush it out before downloading and you might be satisfied with this overly simple tennis download. I felt successful on ditching my pre-conceptions, but there's no way around that sinking feeling that I just spent several bucks on Pong.", "date": "Jan 27, 2006"}
