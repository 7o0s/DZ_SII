While the plot is well thought out, no adventure game should be finished in less than four hours.  Road to India was too quickly completed for it to be anything less than disappointing.  The player is cast as Fred Reynolds, looking for his beloved Anusha, who has been kidnapped.  As the game progresses, it becomes obvious that Anusha's kidnapping is related somehow to the Thugs, a supposedly extinct group of men who perform ritual human sacrifices to the goddess Kali.    Road to India begins with a revealing look at this secret organization called the Thugs long thought dead in India.  A cut-scene tells of a man dropping a briefcase in the middle a busy merchant square.  As the man is walking away, he bumps into a beautiful woman, who is later disclosed to be a famous Indian actress, Laj Vanti.  Several seconds later, an explosion rocks the square and realization hits that there was a bomb in the briefcase.  Flash forward one year and Fred Reynolds, the protagonist in this game, is bidding farewell to his girlfriend, Anusha, as she is returning to India.  Several days later, Fred receives a Dear John letter from his beloved Anusha.  Stunned and heartbroken, he hops on the first plane to India.  On the flight over, he has a dream and so starts the game.  The game is broken up into dream sequences and reality sequences.  In the dreams, players are exposed to a classic India, with beautiful gardens and idyllic buildings.  It is always clear when a dream sequence is playing, as a white haze surrounds the screen.  Most dream sequences have simple puzzles to solve and there is no interaction with characters.  The reality sequences show an unattractive, modern India.  Hard stone and dingy buildings are a common sight.  In modern India, Fred investigates the kidnapping of his girlfriend and gets knocked out quite often, which leads to the dreams.  Deja vu sets in as the reality scenarios are played though since they do vaguely resemble the dreams.  The puzzles range from pretty easy to really easy to ~a lobotomized monkey with one eye could figure this out~ easy.  Speaking of monkeys, in one puzzle, Fred has to use a monkey to obtain a key from a desk after the guard becomes unconscious.  The puzzle involves using sounds a monkey would make to move the monkey forward in a certain manner so it can grab the key.  In addition to puzzles, interaction with objects is important.  Items must be retrieved from various locations and used in a certain manner to progress through the game.  On one occasion, I became extremely irritated because I could not see the item I needed.  The graphics are too dark in the area the item, which is a door handle, is located.  Other than the door handle, however, all other items are obvious and puzzles are completed in record time.  Interaction with the game is pretty simple.  Left click to interact with the environment.  The mouse pointer indicates when an action can be taken.  It changes to footprints when Fred can move into another location.  Lips indicate that a person can be interacted with.  Inventory items can be picked up and, if an item can be used in an area, the item is highlighted.  The game can be played entirely by pointing and clicking and there is no need to ever use the keyboard.  The manual gives the basic information needed to jump right into Road to India and start the adventure.   Right clicking brings up a PDA, which stores the inventory and keeps notes.  Every time something new is added to the PDA, the icon flashes in the bottom right corner of the screen.  You can interact with inventory items, combine items or use one with your environment.  Also, Fred periodically writes about his experiences, which can be helpful in finding the way because he writes down some things that might be missed.  Also, any time Fred picks up books or writings, he puts little notes about what they are in the PDA that can help.  All the cut-scenes can be viewed in the PDA and the game is saved or loaded from there as well.   The graphics are very well done.  Instead of the grainy video of yore, they are all computer animation, with many, many cut-scenes, which I love.  India is portrayed beautifully.  There is 360 degree panning so players can explore the environment thoroughly, although interaction with objects is very limited.  The viewpoint is first-person.  The sound effects and voice acting are well done.  The music only adds to the impression that Fred is in India.  The voice acting is believable, with Fred sporting no accent and many of those he encounters with India heavily accented.  The game was very stable and I had no trouble playing through it.    Road to India is not a complicated game.  In fact, it's pretty straightforward with a linear storyline and a limited number of things that can be done.  It is an adventure game, but it is not like the adventure games I am used to.  The game does not have longevity. I finished the game in about three and a half hours.  While I am an experienced adventure gamer, it will be a huge disappointment to anyone who thrills in adventure games and for newcomers, it will give a poor impression of the genre.  This game is entertaining, but much too brief.  The puzzles are simplistic.  Yes, the graphics are a sight, but do not make up for everything else lacking.  If you are an adventure gamer who enjoys a good adventure and cares little about complicated puzzles, then this is the game for you.  If you are a player who thrives on logic puzzles and complications, this game is not for you.  The brevity and simplicity would leave you hugely dissatisfied.  -- Staci Krause      Want to share your opinions with the world?
