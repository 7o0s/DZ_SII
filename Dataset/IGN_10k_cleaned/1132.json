Oh, there's a game in it, too.  With a host of actors, including Mark Hamill from Star Wars and Malcolm McDowell from Star Trek Generations, Wing Commander 4 sets the stage with an awesome line-up of movie hall-of-famers. The story takes place with Maniac, a confederation pilot, going off to a desert planet to get Col. Blair to return to duty, and put down revolutionary forces threatening to overthrow the Confederation.  The majority of the game is spent watching FMV clips of the actors. Occasionally, you're called to choose between plot points. It has to be said the video quality is excellent for the PlayStation, with hardly any artifacting at all. However, this does not a game make.  The actual game part is extremely poor. Navigate your ship from base to base while shooting enemies. Set in a first-person perspective, you can track ships by radar and blast them away with a small variety of ships and weapons. The graphics are laughably bad when compared to the quality of video.  Besides outstanding on-screen performances, Wing Commander 4 has no redeeming qualities. The game stinks. The on-screen battles are presented in low-res and  the control is simply horrible and painful to play. If you want to watch Mark Hamill in a bad movie, rent Corvette Summer. Otherwise, skip this $10 million flop.", "date": "May 22, 1997"}
