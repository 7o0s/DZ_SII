{"name": "Johnny Crash", "name_review": "Johnny Crash", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/johnny-crash", "text": "Digital Chocolate had a very strange debut in the mobile scene -- almost bizarrely muted with some really, uh, interesting releases like Bubble Ducky and Basbeall Heroes. But DChoc is certainly making a serious at turning things around, and the pick-up of Sumea is obviously a great way to start the process. The talented developer has created a suite of compelling cellphone games in the past, such as Pitfall! The Lost Expedition. And now they're working a little magic with Johnny Crash.   You only need one button to play this game, the ~OK~ key. The game is that simple to get started with. Now, getting huge scores with that single button? That's another story altogether.   Johnny Crash is a stunt dude that excels in the art of air surfing. After firing Crash out of the cannon, you use the ~OK~ key to make him ~flap~ and gain a little more air. Repeatedly jam on ~OK~ and Johnny will keep moving higher. Of course, get him too vertical and he'll stall out, greatly reducing your distance. Don't ~flap~ enough and Johnny will get going too fast on his descent that you cannot pull up. And that's it.   Well, unless you count the mid-air obstacles and ground targets. There are mid-air things like kits are lightning bolts that propel you further. There are birds that earn you extra points if you crash into them. And there are things which must be avoided, lest you crash into the ground sooner than hoped. And when it is finally time to fall back to earth, the goal is often to skid or far as you possibly can to make a little extra distance or smash into a target that racks up additional points.   Playing Johnny Crash is both an ease and a joy. Anybody can get through the first few rounds and rack up decent enough scores. That's what gets you hooked. Later levels really ramp up the difficulty, stretching the level goals to greater distances and throwing far more stunt-stoppers in the way.   Johnny Crash is accented by a series of little butt-rock riffs that really fit the character. The backgrounds a little plain jane, but that's not the focus of the game. Johnny himself is a decently detailed little fella, and you get to know him better in crash-tacular close-ups of when he piles into a hazard.Johnny Crash's one-button gameplay is extremely simple and refreshing. The concept is very basic, balance altitude with longitude, but Sumea gets a lot of mileage out of it by infusing the game with character and tight control. You'll likely just enjoy the game in spurts -- I never made a marathon out of it myself -- but bite-sized gameplay is the hallmark of good mobile gaming. This is a great release for DChoc -- it delivers on the kind of promise the company had a year ago. Better late than never.", "date": "Mar 12, 2005"}
