{"name": "Orcs and Elves", "name_review": "Orcs & Elves", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/25/orcs-elves", "text": "Last year, JAMDAT scored a major hit with the release of DOOM RPG, an innovative action-adventure that successfully translated the first-person shooter to mobile with zero sacrifice in atmosphere. DOOM RPG's engine surfaced earlier this summer in EA Mobile's new cellphone RPG, a traditional swords-n-sorcery affair that crams so many genre staples into a single download that even the most cynical dungeon master will have to roll a saving throw against squealing delight.   The core storytelling methodology, ghostly dwarves and foreboding parchment, is pure Dungeons & Dragons, which is no surprise, considering the idea stems from id's John Carmack, an avowed pen-and-paper player from yesteryear. You'll come across dragon merchants, giant rats, and skinless wraiths. If you geeked out over those old Monster Manuals and Fiend Folios, you'll enjoy the menacing menagerie that shows up in Orcs & Elves. Also from the D&D oeuvre: a host of magical potions and items, medieval weapons like swords and crossbows, rune puzzles, and the constant collection of gold.   Fantasy fans need no longer bring their Robert Jordan paperbacks to the airport -- there's a good eight to ten hours of dungeon crawling and turn-based battles. (Although, the official Orcs & Elves website says only five hours -- it's always good to undersell and surprise later.) You collect experience points for slaying monsters, leveling up to increase player stats like strength and defense.   RPGs have a reputation for being thick affairs, full of deep menus and time-consuming character management. These are not appropriate game mechanics for mobile, and developer Fountainhead, building on the DOOM RPG foundation, manages to keep movement and action very accessible. The game still plays out like a grid where you move one ~square~ at a time, allowing Fountainhead to preserve the effective first-person view without worry of the blurring that has plagued previous FPS mobile games. It also let them really draw up some nice sprites for the creatures which are large and full of color and detail.   Also a major plus -- which makes the game quite manageable -- is the save-anywhere feature. You can quickly record your progress anywhere in the game's nine levels, which is perfect for even the briefest of mobile gaming sessions.   There's no way you cannot be impressed with the overall look and atmosphere of the game -- especially if fantasy of your bag. The musty dungeons, the classic D&D-esque monsters, the sword that actually appears in-frame when you enter combat with a beastie.   The big question I have, however, after plowing through this adventure is: How many non-fantasy fans will want to see this epic through to the end? How many may be put off by the story and locations, heavily steeped in classic fantasy? (Not that this can be, in any way, held against the game. In fact, kudos to EA Mobile for branching out into fantasy.)   Perhaps Orcs & Elves isn't meant for the casual mobile gamer -- even though it has casual-friendly controls. Maybe this is just a hardcore game for the hardcore, traditional RPG fan set. But if it does reach out to them, does it not stand as a bridge into the mobile game landscape? After finishing Orcs & Elves, they'll see the phone as a completely legit gaming platform and be tempted to stick? On that level, Orcs could be a rousing success.  It's too easy just to recommend Orcs & Elves to mobile gamers that enjoyed DOOM RPG -- even though the games are remarkably similar in mechanics and control, but with Orcs enjoying what I think is a substantial boost in visuals. (I tested Orcs an on LG VX7000 and VX8100.) The core game play is definitely sound and quite a bit of fun, especially after you wade an hour or so into the adventure and start getting to the really good stuff. The impact may be a little lessened due to my more-than-passing familiarity with DOOM RPG, but on a technical level, this is an excellent production.That said, fantasy can be a tough sell: Heavy exposition and fantasy staples may prove a turn-off to casual gamers with an aversion to swords, dragons, and that brand of whimsy. However, if you are willing to spare a few dollars and want to try something different than puzzles are simplistic action games, Orcs is a good way to chart a new course.", "date": "Jul 25, 2006"}
