You couldn't quit while you were ahead, could you, dear? Or rather publisher Eidos didn't know when to retire their famous Ms. Croft.  But who could blame them...the played-out Tomb Raider series still makes mega-bucks around the world. Tomb Raider: Chronicles takes place after Lara's death in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, and is a collection of memories about previously untold adventures in Lara Croft's past. So, have developers Core made Chronicles a game worth adding to your Tomb Raider library? Distressingly, though not surprisingly, the answer is a resounding ~no.~ I'm afraid they've finally milked this cash cow completely dry.   If you've ever played a Tomb Raider game before, then you've played Tomb Raider: Chronicles. Sure, there are a few new moves for Lara, such as the hand-to-hand stealth attack, bar spin, and tightrope walk. Guns can now be fitted with laser sights to ~snipe~ enemies, but the view only comes across as disorienting, and is basically impossible to target perfectly. They didn't make anything more than a minor change to the regular Tomb Raider gameplay, which still consists mainly of falling off high ledges, reloading, and falling off again. At one point the Tomb Raider formula was fun, impressive, and even brilliant, but it's been shoved down our throats far too long to remain that way. Ladders and climbable walls are still 2D textures rather than 3D models, which makes the outrageous amount of time wasted hunting in the dark a ceaseless torment. While the levels are at times stunningly gorgeous, they've lost that magical sense of sheer terror and danger that was found is such heavy doses in the early titles.   Tomb Raider: Chronicles has four main levels, or areas, each tackling a different time in Lara's life we haven't yet learned about. The levels have nothing in the way of continuity between them, because they are all memories of Lara after her death. Level one, which is set on the streets of Rome, looks great and showcases the graphical improvements nicely. However, the ~flip-switch, find-key~ puzzles are pathetic and almost pitiable. Things start picking up a bit with level two, which starts on a submarine base and caries on into a Russian nuclear submarine. But, easily the coolest part -- the deep-sea dive outside of the submarine  is far too short and childishly simple.   Level three is a bit of a joke. You take control of a younger (yet still absurdly large-busted) early-teen Lara through an adventure that can only be compared with a terrible Nancy Drew novel or a run-of-the-mill Nickelodeon after school special. Lara is completely weaponless through the level, having to simply dodge all the miserable, slowly walking zombies and skeletons. Level four, on the other hand, is a wicked jaunt in a futuristic city, complete with black-suited baddies wearing colored sunglasses, a headset microphone a la Britney Spears for Lara, and a vicious HK assault rifle. It's incredible fun, and almost single-handedly lifts this title...almost.   The graphical improvements are easily noticeable, although not dramatic. The new Lara graphics are impressive, if a bit cartoonish, and the backgrounds, water effects, and cut scenes are quite dazzling even on a mid-level machine. But, the graphics certainly couldn't be confused with state-of-the-art, and although there are few games of the genre to compare them with, they aren't even close to what other genres are doing on the visual end of things. Even a lot of RPG's now have more impressive graphics, and although the improvements in Tomb Raider: Chronicles are noticed and appreciated, they are still quite mediocre. My major complaint with the graphics is the poor sense of scale, particularly with everyday items and places. Doorways can be 10 feet tall, dinner tables on the submarine level stand as tall as Lara's neck, and rooms have no sense of reality to them. In addition, everything has a flat look to it, from the walls to the mountains.   The sound work is overwhelmingly average. Lara's guns sound hollow, safe, and meek, and the enemies attacking her sound even less frightening, with the lions make a laughable little, ~Grrr,~ instead of the mighty roar that should be reserved for the king of beats.  The ambient background noises are nothing spectacular, with simple street noises for the streets and buzzing engine noises for the submarine. The music is as it's always been for Tomb Raider games  used only to punctuate a dangerous event, such as the appearance of an enemy. It's intended to add suspense, and while early on in the series it did succeed in doing that, it's no longer so effective.   The enemies, while usually quite nicely rendered, come off as looking a bit ridiculous. The gun-toting lackeys in the submarine levels are short, stocky ape-like men that aren't much taller than Lara. Oh, and the Gladiators in Rome are the real kicker. I'd feel like it was more plausible and believable if they'd had dinosaurs running around rather than half naked men in Gladiator armor with pet lions. At least, dinosaurs would have been cooler--and actually scary--instead of just funny and strangely creepy. The enemies in level three--the skeletons, demons, and ghouls--are also comical. However, nearly all is redeemed in Level 4, where at least the enemies are a bit more intimidating.  The level editor included on the second CD is nice addition, and goes some way in compensating for the lack of ingenuity in gameplay. Although it's doubtful to be used by anyone but the most rabid Tomb Raider fans, it is still an effective tool, and will hopefully result in the construction of some good user-created adventures. And, most importantly, with all my complaints against the gameplay, I still couldn't find a single bug in the game. I didn't have any crashes or hang-ups, either, so at least Tomb Raider Chronicles is stable and solid.   What strikes me as the saddest thing is that Eidos has actually begun to believe it's own press hype. They expect Lara to carry the entire series. Unfortunately, Lara is the only thing not holding up Tomb Raider: Chronicles. With the exception of a handful of dodgy looking middle-aged men and a few whiney, greasy-haired adolescents, I don't think anyone plays Tomb Raider games strictly for Lara. They play for the movie-like nonstop action, the escapist plots, and the difficult puzzles. Eidos quite obviously hedged their bets on people not caring about the (lack of) gameplay and fun as long as Lara was in it.    Lara is a superb protagonist, but even she can't save this title from critical damnation. For the sake of her, I truly hope Eidos doesn't push the Tomb Raider series in the same direction that the Police Academy movies went  eventually releasing sequel after sequel that people don't even know, or care to know, exist.  Lara still has a bright future, but it's going to take a complete and total overhaul of control, gameplay, and plot. Tomb Raider: Chronicles can be fun, particularly the killer final level. However, based on the price of the title, and the complete lack of ingenuity, I can't recommend Tomb Raider Chronicles to anyone other than the most frothy-mouthed, rabid Tomb Raider fans. The quality just isn't there.   -- Erik Peterson As a big fan of the Tomb Raider series and a person that often defends it when people argue that it sucks, I really hope that Core gives the series a major overhaul when it brings it to next-generation platforms like the PS2. And I'm not just talking about the graphics engine, either, because the problem with the series goes much deeper than that. The control scheme is severely dated and just isn't the most effective way to control a 3D character in a game being viewed from the 3rd person perspective. All Core needs to do is ditch the Flashback control and have Lara control more like Link does in the Zelda games on the Nintendo 64 and it'll have a real winner on its hands. Just imagine being able to jump from one ledge to another without having to plan it out, as if the simple jump is some sort of mission or puzzle. It'd be a revolutionary step for the series. As it stands, Tomb Raider Chronicles is the best game in the series. And for those of you that are just fine with the way Lara controls and haven't yet been bored by the series, you'll definitely want to pick up this game. On the other hand, if you haven't liked any of the games or got tired of the series after the 2nd, 3rd or 4th games, then there's nothing here in Chronicles that will revitalize your passion for the series or get you to like it for the first time. Tomb Raider Chronicles is basically more of the same, so you probably know better than anyone else whether or not it's something that you'll like.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
