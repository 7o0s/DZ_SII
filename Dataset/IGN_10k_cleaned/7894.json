Most gamers associate the classic cheat with Contra, wherein its entry granted players 30 lives. Here, though, was the code's first ever appearance, used to outfit your starfighter with a full compliment of weapons, options and shields. You'll probably need it. Gradius is tough.Arriving on the NES in 1986, Gradius was the first forced-scrolling shooter released for Nintendo's 8-bit machine. It kickstarted the genre well, establishing a set of gameplay conventions that would become the foundation for several future sequels from Konami, as well as providing inspiration for other companies' efforts.The star of Gradius is its starship, the Vic Viper. The fighter offers standard, slow maneuverability and a weak main gun to begin with, but is heavily upgradeable  a power-up meter is displayed on the bottom of the screen, and gathering glowing energy icons left behind by defeated foes activates a progressively more impressive array of optional abilities. Speed-Up increases the Viper's acceleration. Missile gives you missiles. Double splits your gun into a two-directional weapon, while Laser elongates each shot into a more damaging and penetrating energy beam. Options and Shields round out the offerings, the former giving you a tag-along partner orb that replicates your attacks and the latter equipping your ship with an ammo-blocking barrier.The depth and variety of the game's power-ups was an immediate draw for players back in the '80s, and still holds up today. Modern updates to the series still use the same basic formula now, over two decades later, and also pay homage to another key feature first seen in Gradius  the core. ~Shoot the core!~ is the series' call to action, referencing the pulsating inner energy chamber that serves as the weak spot for the vast majority of Gradius boss characters. The core is almost always protected by a stack of shielding plates, making each boss battle a delicate dance of dodging and destruction as you slowly eke away at each level of defense and clear a path for the final, fatal shot.Gradius is still a lot of fun to play today, though is does feel a bit sparse in some areas. Level design isn't as complex or engaging as later games in the series, and its relatively high level of difficulty could be a turn-off for some players. Only one player can challenge the forces of evil at a time, and the overall length of the game isn't too great  skilled pilots could fly through to the final boss in 20 minutes or less. The follow-up to Gradius on the NES, Life Force, offered a two-player co-operative mode and the SNES edition of Gradius III featured a much deeper and longer play experience. Those titles will certainly show up on the Virtual Console eventually, so gamers wanting a bit more value for their Wii Points may want to wait.The original Gradius is a great, classic shooter that set the bar high for later games in the genre. This Virtual Console release is an emulation of the NES version, the most popular and notable rendition of the game, and the version responsible for introducing the Konami Code to the world of gaming. This version hasn't been previously re-released anywhere else, so the Wii is a good place to grab it  if you'd like to experience the arcade original instead, though, it can be found in the recent PSP release, Gradius Collection.", "date": "Jan 9, 2007"}
