License-hungry and prepared to expand its sports kingdom, EA bought up nearly all of the great licenses for old greats and current belt holders. From Sugar Ray Robinson and Rocky Marciano to Sugar Ray Lewis and Muhammad Ali to Lennox Lewis and Oscar De La Hoya, the franchise Knockout Kings was essentially perfectly built.   But while the series immediately appealed to rapid boxing fans, hardcore gamers found the actual boxing to be awkward, slow and unsatisfying. Now, in its fourth iteration and for the first time on the PlayStation 2 Knockout Kings looks and plays better than ever before. With great Fantasy Fights between classic and modern contenders and Exhibition fights for true boxing fans and a deep Career mode for hardcore gamers, KK 2001 is a well-rounded boxing game that will satisfy most gamers without any excuses.   Gameplay Knockout Kings is well rounded and fun to play because it's a faster game than it's ever been, it's deeper with strategies, and because of a great new training system. It is designed for several kinds of gamers, without giving up any integrity to the core experience. And for anyone who has ever watched a boxing match or who has played a boxing game, the core experience is clocking the pudding out of your opponent. Knockout Kings delivers that experience with fast new punch combinations and superb looking animations that show the physical impact of those heavy-duty hits and puts a satisfying smile on your face.    The control is the heart of the game, and for the most part, they're solid. They're certainly fast when it comes to combinations, multiple jabs and cross-ups. But they're not good at all when it comes to moving the boxers around on the floor. In fact, boxers are slow and hard to move around when prompted. Likewise, the amount of split-second timing that is so much a part of boxing isn't found here. The overall speed of the game is not bad, but when was the last time you complained about Tekken or Dead or Alive being too slow, and for that matter, Ready to Rumble 2? Those games are fast, and therefore incredibly satisfying. Still in its defense, in the boxing simulation arena, EA's boxers are controlled with a decent amount of punching speed, with increasingly fast combinations, either with automatic moves or manual moves.   With several modes to choose from, Slugfest, Exhibition, Career, Fantasy Fights, and Boxer Bios, gamers have an excellent list that should enable them to fight in any way they like. Slugfest is set up for players to instantly go head to head, defense be damned. You start a game and pound it out. Exhibition enables you to play as your favorite boxer and lead his career into the starlight of success, or down into the dank alleyways of despair. Career enables you to create a boxer's key characteristics and then lead a totally unknown entity down the road of success. Built into this mode is a training mini-mode that works to grow your skills. Then there is Fantasy Fight, a pre-selected set of match-ups between well-known belt holders. In Fantasy Fights players get to read a little press conference in which the two boxers rib one another before the fight, creating rivalries, starting up the blood, and creating an aggressive tone.   Slugfest is essentially for folks who just get a quick fight in while having a few drinks. It's all about hammering away at each other for fun. Fantasy Fights are great for a little story and a re-creation of history. If you're a boxing fan, this mode will make you dance for joy. And Exhibition is really quite deep. It enables you -- for the most part -- to fight as your favorite boxer, using his or her special skills and fighting style to win the championship belt. It's a tough road to haul if you aren't skilled, and it's not necessarily easy.   That's where Career Mode comes in. If you aren't quite ready for the big time, Career will lead you to redemption. This mode is deep with subtle features that truly train you to box. Once players create their boxers, they can train, fight or save. It's always good to train first because the sessions teach you new moves and sharpen your skills. The session lessons range from teaching simple punches and defense techniques, like low and high blocks, to more difficult defense styles, such as ducking and countering with a flurry of upper cuts. In one situation, I had to fend off an opponent with more health than I had but who could potentially be knocked out if I blocked him right and threw the right combinations (combinations that the session had just taught me). When you train well, you can add a good sum of points to your roster of characteristics, like stamina, strength, power, speed, and so on. When you train poorly, fewer points are awarded.    Career is even more helpful and well designed than that. For instance, I won three fights before losing. In my loss, I was hammered with combos and hooks. When I went back to training, the session focused specifically on countering hooks and how to block combos. EA spent quite a bit of time coding the game so that not only is training helpful to build up points, but to truly train you where you are weakest. It's a clever, subtle thing, and it certainly was done on purpose. It's a great addition.   Another great thing about Knockout Kings, besides the new style format, is that players can throw the cheap stuff, too. By reading the manual or by playing through training, players learn the dirty, but realistic moves that make the pros so gritty. Hey! You too can learn how to fight like a pro with moves such as head-butts, kidney punches, elbows, and below-the-belt punches, and back of the head punches! After all, what can punch can you pull off other than a head butt or an elbow when you're in a clench?   Another thing I have noticed about fights. Each one is totally different. The AI is not nice, and it doesn't always fight the way you would expect it to. For example, in one of my first fights in the Career mode, I came out with a Haymaker uppercut and on my very first punch I knocked the opponent flat on his back! In another fight, I was winning in points but in the fourth round I was decked so hard, I couldn't get up.   But Knockout Kings isn't without its faults. There is a strange sense of collision detection in the game. In cut-scenes during intros, boxers magically splice their bodies right through the ropes. And during clenches, hands go through parts of the opponents' bodies. There are absolutely no boxer facial animations, and so while Muhammad Ali may look like his real self for the most part, his eyes are those of a lifeless zombie.   But those are minor complaints, really, because they don't affect the core gameplay in any dramatic way. What's truly missing is any real sense of speed and grace. Knockout Kings 2001 lacks any sense of fluid movement or quick freestyle boxing that's so readily and regularly apparent in the best games in the fighting genre. And because of that it, gameplay is often frustrating, annoying, and just too damn slow.   For instance, in Knockout Kings 2001 when you play someone like Muhammad Ali or Sugar Ray Leonard, both of whom fight with a bob-and-weave, dance-and-jab styles of fighting, you're screwed. It's not that you can't throw their punches or bob and weave, but the sense of fluidity and foot speed just isn't there. You can't move in, throw your combos and then get out quick. You move in and you get stuck there. And then you are almost assuredly going to get clocked. The foot speed of ~freestyle~ fighters of this sort, which should be lighting fast, is sorely absent and unfortunate.   Last, there are several woman selections in most modes. Women boxing is growing steadily popular in sports and EA has always been the first to exploit its own equal opportunity ways. I guess EA sees woman boxers as part of a potential market, so hey! Why not!   Graphics What is instantly gratifying in Knockout Kings 2001 is the graphics. Knockout Kings is the best looking boxing game I have ever seen. The skin textures are brilliant. Boxers have different colored skins, and the variations are realistic in subtlety, be they African-American, Latino, or Caucasian. The great variety of body shapes is also stunning. Boxers' shoulder, neck sizes, head shapes, mid-riffs, and stomachs are all substantially different. I mean, every boxer shows off a different size, girth, and shape of abdominal muscles that are totally stunning for a videogame. It's pretty rare that I get excited about stomach textures, but hey, when you see the bodies, you'll know what I mean.    No doubt about it, the skin textures in Knockout Kings are stunning. What's also incredibly likeable is that some of the in-game, and all of the cut-scene, motion capture work. What I mean by that is when you watch the characters in the menu and in the pre-game scenes warming up, punching, and stretching, they move with incredible realism. It's beautiful to watch. But then you get into the game and much of that beauty is lost. As I have said before, the boxers' footwork is incredibly slow, and while much of the punches are painstakingly coded, some of the punches that are thrown look robotic. Boxers punch with their shoulders, and their weight behind them. Even jabs activate several muscles in the neck and torso. But not in Knockout Kings. Here you can throw a punch and the rest of your body will stand perfectly still.   Still, the game has come a long, long way from its 32-bit cousin. The graphics are, for the most part, a world of improvement. The real life fighters have pretty damn fast punch animations that are quite satisfying to watch. In fact the animations department is very impressive indeed. Boxers can taunt in several different ways; my favorite is the Ali foot shuffle. They also get clocked -- knocked out -- in a surprising range of ways. My favorite knockout animation shows the opponent getting decked to the floor, instantly standing up, then weaving like a drunk sailor across the floor until he weakens in the knees and then slams face first into the ring. And who said that EA didn't have a sense of humor...   Players will find dozens of excellent animations through the game that don't show up in the first five minutes. For instance, some of the time, you'll close in on the opponent and you'll cut him. The blood, just like the sweat before it, flies off, this time it's just red. Other times, when you close in on a knockout, you'll knock the mouth guard right out of his mouth. It's incredibly effective.   And perhaps taking a nod from the fast, funny but shallow Ready to Rumble, Knockout Kings 2001 shows the deterioration of the boxers' face as he or she is pounded into ground meat. First you'll see a cut. Then maybe the eyes will start to well up with pinkish circles. Later on the eyes may get black and blue-ish. After that the face starts to swell, and one of the boxers' eyes might close altogether. You get a close up look at the boxer sitting in his seat in between each round, and when the guy takes on all of the effects -- swollen eyes, cut lips, pink marks, and all -- the overall effect is quite impressive.   The introductions are perhaps the most confusing aspect of the game. Everybody knows that when a boxer struts into ring, he comes in with a frickin' cloak over his head and his entourage surrounding him. It's not always the pattern that's followed, but it's usually what is done. In Knockout Kings, the boxers walk out without robes and without their entourage...and well, without much at all. Then, some boxers actually dance to their own intro music. In career mode, I watched the 15th ranked sucker, who was fat and a bad boxer, groovin' to his own intro music, with flabby stomach moving to the groove, just a moment or two behind the beat... What the heck is this sh@t? Hm? EA has apparently tried to knick a bit of the old wrestling charm from the WWF in its boxing game. It's not a bad thing, really. But it's not daunting, and it seems completely out of whack with the rest of the game.   The weakest part of the graphics is the crowd. The 2D flat pixilatted crowd at least moves. But I don't know, it just seems like it could be moving faster, or look better or something. The crowd here is no better than in any PlayStation game, and it detracts from the overall quality of the rest of the graphics.   Sound The music and overall sound effects in Knockout Kings is all very polished and produced with quality in mind. The crowd sounds are far better than their looks. The wave of sound crashes in likes waves, responding to big hits or mediocre rounds appropriately. The litany of grunts and moans are well timed and sound accurate and real, too.   The real sounds of the announcers and the refs are a big plus. And what's more, the commentary from Al Bernstein, Max Kellerman and Teddy Atlas is fluid and reacts to the game itself. The commentators react to the actual fights in general and the kinds of throws and patterns that are thrown. For instance, if you keep getting hammered in the stomach, the commentators will say something like, ~ Ohhh, ANOTHER hit in the stomach. How can he take so much punishment?~ So, not only do the announcers comment on your individual fight, they actually may help you recognize the opponent's punch pattern.   One last thing. The music is varied for many tastes. And players can select the introductory music for their specific intro. It's a nice touch among a slew of nice subtle options and configurations that make KK 2001 such a good game.After getting to grips with Knockout Kings 2001, learning the control set-up, and practicing my combinations, I have to say that Knockout Kings 2001 is a lot of fun. Simulation boxing games have been in the most part difficult to like. On PlayStation the games simply didn't look good enough or move fast enough. Now, with the first KK on PlayStation 2, EA has definitely looked at all of the most crucial aspects of the game and has done the best it can do. The result is a very satisfying boxing game. Playing in career mode is deep and truly teaches and trains you to box better, and the Fantasy Fights are perfect for fans of boxing who have always imagined boxing as their idols. The game isn't perfect, but it's well-polished and very well rounded in every aspect. Most combinations are fast, and boxers come at you with different boxing styles that you have to adapt to in order to win the match. I was actually quite surprised at how much fun this game is. If you're a boxing fan, or if you liked Knockout Kings but wanted more, then you should definitely go out and buy this game. Heck, if you're a big fan of great abdominals, then you should get this game. And if you want to see Sugar Ray Robinson beat someone who wasn't even alive when he boxed, like Lennox Lewis, you need to get this game.", "date": "Feb 9, 2001"}
