It joins two top-tier titles, Sin & Punishment and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, under the American Virtual Console's Import banner, but other than having some appeal through its quirky main character, Ninja JaJaMaru-kun feels completely out of place next to such excellent company. This little game is quaint at best, and you're probably better off passing its pricetag by  especially since it's elevated to the premium-charging 600 Wii Point level.   JaJaMaru-kun is a rugged little red-robed ninja, a small and shrimpy shinobi who's called upon to rescue the lovely Princess Sakura from the pirate lord Namazu Dayuu. The pirate lord Namazu Dayuu, wishing, of course, to make permanent his kidnapping, dispatches wave after wave of minions and monsters to keep JaJaMaru-kun from breaking through his fortress.   You advance through Ninja JaJaMaru-kun, then, by breaking through his fortress. Using your head, like Mario, you leap and break through barriers of bricks above you in each stage, clearing the way to get to each of the eight individual monsters who populate each level. You can attack Namazu's creatures by stunning them with a jump on their head, and you can eliminate them altogether by throwing a shuriken at them with the B Button.      When all eight foes are finished in any single level, you move on to the next  where the enemies will be a little more upgraded and a little bit tougher each time. Though the opposition starts off slow, you'll soon be faced by fast, resilient monsters that will take more strategy to take down, and more powerful boss monsters leading the way from the uppermost floor.   It's all very basic and repetitive, with a flair of design that's much in keeping with its originating era of the early to mid-'80s. Control will be your biggest trouble, as it's not nearly as natural and smooth to direct JaJaMaru-kun as it is other 8-bit heroes  but persistence pays off with a few funny surprises, like a giant frog.   Naruto must have taken a page or two from JaJaMaru-kun, because in addition to having the brightly-colored ninja outfit and love interest named Sakura in common, this little ninja hero also summons enormous toads. It's hard to accomplish, but if you manage to collect enough different power-up items through bashing through enough brick barriers, you'll eventually be able to call upon Gamapakun, the ultimate amphibian. JaJaMaru-kun will then leap up onto Gamapakun's back, as all active enemies slow into a frozen state and you easily hop around the screen eating them all up.   Finally, if you're possessive of exceptional diligence, you'll be able to take on Namazu Dayuu directly in bonus round competitions  defeat him, and the Princess is saved. Your love will flourish forever. Or for a few seconds, at least, until the game picks back up and keeps on going like nothing just happened  JaJaMaru-kun's an arcade design at heart, and it's not going to let something as sensible as completing the story keep it from throwing more and more monsters at you, endlessly, until you either hit a Game Over screen or decide to see what else is happening on your Wii's Channel Array.  With so many other Japan-only, unreleased-elsewhere titles in its own first-party back catalog, it's a bit puzzling to place why Nintendo would decide to make Ninja JaJaMaru-kun, an abstract arcade action title developed by Jaleco, its third Import category release. If you're a major fan of the fact that Nintendo's finally offering some of these previously-unseen titles on our shores, then it might be worth your while to continue supporting the practice by dropping 600 Wii Points on a download here. But most players would be better off not worrying about this little ninja, because Ninja JaJaMaru-kun, while cute, doesn't have the depth to hold your interest long.", "date": "Oct 23, 2007"}
