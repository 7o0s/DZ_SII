His fearlessness are only as formidable as his sharpness. Sheathe his blade, shackle his mind, and smite his body, and hope is lost. Noble cause or not, adventure is the test of the man. Adventure is a physical challenge, and the weak need not stand up and take arms. Those that do will die long before they can ever call themselves warriors.    Nine worlds with 15 areas to explore Cast spells against or battle by hand more than 30 fearsome monsters Only for Game Boy Color    This Warriors of Might and Magic hasn't the warrior's spirit. It hasn't got the strength, the cunning, or even the blade. 3DO betrayed its Warrior with an RPG / adventure hybrid that brandishes its weapon like a child and has the physicality of a buzzard, that approaches danger with its eyes closed and its mind empty.   The greatness of any adventure title is usually measured by the excitement of its combat. A wondrous story, a gallant cause... Fine fine. Give me a weapon and a worthy opponent, and I will take up any cause. The fighter of WoMM, alas, is burdened with a bladeless weapon. Sword strikes reach a pixel or two in length beyond the character's sprite -- imagine fighting with your arm bound to your body, and only the length of your wrist's stroke as an attack. Enemy intelligence hasn't the wit to avoid these feeble attacks, and their only course of action is to stand idle and absorb weak hits, occasionally delivering their own meager counters. These are absurd and awkward graceless battles where players stand near opponents and tap the button until their foe disappears. There is little reaction, little feedback, little action and excitement.  The adventure takes an upswing later on, when bows and arrows are introduced (although hand weapons continue to disappoint with better armaments), but Warriors still stumbles in the darkness of its control. Leaping is clumsy, with a short, stocky bounce in the character's jump that hardly clears the simplest of gaps (the ineptitude of which is compensated some by a drifting collision detection where jumps drift in the air before they land). In a world filed with bottomless chasms (that are easy enough just to slip into with the slippery controls), the hero meets far too many deaths at his own bungling hands.  This would be a daunting enough quest with a skilled warrior, and with WoMM's gawky hero, it's hopeless. And yet there still is no kindness granted players from 3DO  the game's unrelenting Save feature  dumps players back at the very beginning of every huge stage, no matter if they were a single step in or about to reach that last switch. Hours of effort can be ruined in a heartbeat. And similarly cruel, the game does not allow player to backtrack -- once they leave a town or stage, they cannot return for what they forgot --  and the shop keeps senselessly refuse to tell how much their goods cost -- players must guess whether or not an item is affordable, and accept the loss of however much gold is taken upon the sale.  In its visuals, Warriors of Might and Magic paints a pretty nothing. Graphics are sharp and detailed, but expressionless and devoid of character or style. The hero is featureless, the enemies equally vague (spiders and bats are well-drawn when they're not blending into the background, but common thugs are formless green blobs). It's a really clear picture of nothing. Large bosses do impress in their size, but flicker and animate  choppily. At least the dungeons, the forests, and the caverns are etched with vibrant colors and detail -- not always enough to make it easy to identify where one is in the world, but the churches and statues spotting this world are unique. And praise is due to the game's orchestral score, hearkening back to the Amiga system compositions of blending instruments and digitized organs. It's played a little too digital for this land, but the complex sound and stirring chords aren't something heard much on the Game Boy Color.     On the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, Warriors of Might and Magic was an intense melee combat action game only a quarter slot away from Gauntlet. The same was expected of the Game Boy Color version  in fact, the same developer as the lost Gauntlet Legends GBC is behind Warriors for 3DO. But the design clearly went somewhere wrong in the transition -- even the story is completely different, hinging on the same characters, but instead filling in the dull back-story instead of the wicked intrigue and treachery of the more compelling Might and Magic titles.Legend of Zelda since that's the greatest success story of the Game Boy system. This game abandons the promising roots of a brutal Gauntlet battle (which in and of itself would have been difficult to achieve depth with, but at least has its combat firmly grounded in ferocious action) for the impossibly elusive Zelda formula. Many have tried, and near all have failed -- Link may be diminutive, but he is still a warrior of unequaled caliber. Against even the good Zelda clones (Crystalis, Brave Fencer Musashi),Warriors of Might and Magic is armed only with a rusty, pitted, edgeless dagger.", "date": "Feb 8, 2001"}
