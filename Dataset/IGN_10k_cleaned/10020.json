For around twenty years the company has turned out computer versions of every conflict imaginable. Unfortunately, these days, not a lot of the new gamers understand just how much fun a wargame can be. The arguments are fairly familiar  there's not enough action to keep short attention spans happy, it's hard to learn how to play, and the games themselves tend to be based on historical conflicts that, no matter how sad it may be, younger players just aren't all that interested in. With their latest release, Warhammer 40,000: Rites of War, SSI is trying to change all that. The new title takes the engine and interface from the company's extremely intuitive Panzer General 2 and combines it with the rich and entertaining Warhammer 40K universe with the idea of creating a play experience that is both entertaining to those who aren't history buffs and easy for anyone to pick up and play. The result is pretty solid, but still isn't the gateway to wargaming that SSI was most likely hoping for.  The game's storyline is based on the popular Games Workshop pen and paper RPG wargaming system of the same name. In the single player campaign mode, you take on the role of the Eldars, a powerful race of psychics who have spent ages terraforming barren worlds into Edens. The technology used by the race to do this is slow to work (each world takes thousands of years), so the Eldars would seed a planet and then return to their home worlds. After a cataclysm that destroyed all of their home planets, the Eldars set off in giant ships they called Craftworlds to inhabit the planets they had seeded so many years before. Unfortunately, in their absence, these worlds had been discovered and colonized by Humans. Appalled by what they considered to be an act of outright theft, the Eldars launched an attack to take back their carefully made homes. You take on the role of one of the Eldar Commanders, ordered by your master to lay waste to the Human forces and take back the world that is rightfully your own. As you might imagine though, the Humans are pretty attached to this planet and have their own fighting forces, the Imperial Guard and the Space Marines, to protect it. In order to win, you'll have to keep your limited forces as healthy as possible while also making sure that they gain enough glory in battle to advance in the ranks of your military and gain terrible new powers that will help you achieve your ultimate goal.  For those of you who have played Panzer General 2, there's not much explanation of gameplay necessary. Although Rites of War boasts all new units and powers, play proceeds pretty much as in the original wargame. Each turn you move your units, attacking any enemy units within your range by simply clicking on them. Each unit can only move a certain distance each turn, modified by the terrain they are crossing (War Walkers, for instance, must spend two points instead of one to cross mountainous terrain where infantry has to spend all of their movement points just to move forward one hex) and once their points are used up, their turn is up (except in certain special cases). After all your units have moved, the enemy will take their turn(s). Each mission you have a set of goals to achieve, from assassinating an enemy unit to acquiring a hidden artifact, and once that goal has been accomplished, the mission ends and you move on. If all of this sounds pretty basic, that's because it is. Just about anyone will be able to figure out all of the nuances of actual field battle in about fifteen minutes and should feel comfortable with the game in about thirty.  Don't get too cocky though, there's a whole other side to Rites of War that's takes a good bit more learning to get down pat, the Army Management screen. Before each mission, you'll have to buy new units with Glory points that you've accumulated in your previous battle. These same Glory points can also be used to purchase new powers and weapons for your existing soldiers, or to buy 'strategies,' which are basically cheats that you can use at a crucial moment during your next battle to get an edge over the enemy. If some of your units have gained enough personal Glory on the battlefield, then you may be able to promote them to new and more powerful unit types. Even though the casual gamer may balk at all of this, it adds an amazing RPG feel to the game and also encourages you to take more interest in each of your battles. Unlike a RTS game, if you lose a really important unit, you may feel the bite for several missions. Best of all, even though this may all sound complex, Warhammer's well designed interface makes it all very simple and easily accessible to the casual gamer.  The units themselves are designed to create a sort of rock-paper-scissors relationship to each other. For example, Assault units are really good at taking out Artillery units, Artillery units are really good at taking out Aerial units and Aerial units are really good at taking out Assault units. As units increase in experience, they gain bonus to some of their statistics (chosen according to unit type) and so gain a little edge in combat. This means that just because you know what kind of unit you're facing, you can't be sure that the fight will go exactly the way you think it will. There are 70 different units in the game, each with their own special abilities, weakness and cost in glory points. All of the units are well designed and I found the game to be exceptionally well balanced in most unit to unit conflicts.  Rites of War also contains easy to use scenario and map editors. With these tools, you can create your own missions, placing the original units and setting up the enemy AI to attack aggressively, remain passive, or to rush the foe. In the map editor you are able to modify existing game maps shuffling around where different sides deploy their units and where certain objective goals are hidden. This is a particularly handy tool for multiplayer, where just about everyone in the game will probably know the lay of the land before you they get started. With these editors you can make sure that no one (er, except for whoever designed the map) has knowledge that they shouldn't have.  So why didn't this game get a 10? Unfortunately, for all of the things that Warhammer does well (most of which are due to its engine), there's quite a few things that it never really does at all. First off, the game's graphics, while based on fantastic original art, just don't do much to excite at all. When units are stationary, they just stand there like someone pulled their plugs, they move with the same set of animations each time, and they're so small that you can really see too much of what they're doing anyway. Worst of all, since all of the units are the same size, you get no real feeling of the scale inherent in the game. A simple foot soldier stands about as tall as a War Walker. The game's sound is a similar situation. The sound effects do a good enough job of letting you know what each unit has just done, but never go beyond the call of duty to get you really excited or caught up in the battle. Music is competent, but not designed to go along with what's happening on screen well enough to make it anything more than a backdrop  I would rather have had an option to put in my own CD.   The missions themselves are also disappointing, although they have different goals, all seem to play out pretty much the same. Move units forward, run into enemy, shoot it out, read win screen or start over. I never got a real feel that I was getting anything accomplished. Even the new weapons and experience bonuses my characters received always seemed to be balanced well enough by new enemy strengths that the actual fights didn't play out much differently. On the flip side, once I was able to get a full promotion to some of the more powerful units in the game, the missions suddenly became much, much easier. While the designers obviously took a great deal of time making sure that unit to unit combat balance was up to snuff, they didn't spend nearly enough time on making sure that each mission would have enemies that would balance it overall. On a final note, the Map Editor just doesn't let you do enough. I want to build maps from scratch, not just shuffle around goodies on the ones that come with the game.  In the end, Warhammer 40K: Rites of War is a good introductory wargame that could have used a little more passion in its creation. Players new to the wargaming arena or big fans of the Warhammer universe will find the game to be an entertaining, if somewhat tepid, addition to their gaming libraries. Experienced wargaming fans should avoid the title, as it's unlikely to provide them with the challenges and detail that they're accustomed to   -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jul 31, 1999"}
