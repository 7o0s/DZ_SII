Brain Juice was a solid performer, second only to Gameloft's Brain Challenge; IGN Wireless dinged it simply for following too close in the steps of the Nintendo DS Brain Age hit. It was a solid, entertaining game, but where was the patented Digital Chocolate flair -- the cleverness and ingenuity behind hits like Rollercoaster Rush and Tower Bloxx?   The mobile maker's personality shines through a lot more in Brain Juice Energy, the sequel that just landed on Sprint's deck and will soon expand across other major carriers. Everything in Energy, from the presentation to the quality of the mini-games, feels much more DChoc-y. It's by far the superior game to the original and now on par with Gameloft's still-excellent Brain Challenge. The only problem is that the category is saturated and the novelty has long worn-off. If there's one problem about successfully getting in front of a trend, it's that when you go for the sequel, you're wandering through the corpse-laden ground of Me-Too Land.   Energy's twelve mini-games are spread across three categories: Math, memory, and pattern. While you can just dabble in unlocked games, Energy is best enjoyed as a daily regimen. You jump in once a day to complete three events and win medals, ranging from bronze to gold. The more gold medals you earn, the more mini-games you unlock as your brain exercise schedule progresses.   When hiding three-quarters of your mini-games behind a curtain, choosing the trio to put out front is of paramount importance. Two of the three immediately available games are winners: Pairs and Higher Math. In Pairs, numbered widgets bounce around the screen. You press the number of the widget that appears only twice in the ever-growing horde. As you play, the colors and shapes of the widgets get more and more familiar-looking, requiring you to really use an analytical eye. Higher Math is your basic math game, but instead of just running through a series of equations, you watch numbers and math signs float into the screen on balloons. You never know which part of the equation will appear first or last. You may spy a 5 and 4 float into view, but you have to wait on the sign. Will it be multiply or add? Is the answer 20 or 9? It's a great way to change up the now-formulaic math game that pervades almost all brain training titles.   The dud is Door Code, a memorization game where you input number sequences in ever-growing length. Each time you get a sequence right, a new number is added to the end. If you get nine correct -- the longest possible sequence -- you earn extra time. It's boring, but it's fortunately the only boring game in the full twelve.   Highlights:   Banana Slip: This was a favorite -- you see a grid full of obstacles and then have to trace the same path after the hazards have been obscured.   Domino Math: Another good way to spice up the equation game. Two dominos appear on-screen with math signs between them. You have to add, subtract, etc. each half the two vertically stacked dominos.   Lock & Key: An antique key appears at the top of the screen and you must quickly pick out which locks it would fit from a field of four at the bottom.   If you like fractions, you'll also enjoy the Cheese Hunter game, where you must gather up cheese wedges. Grocery shoppers may score well at Market Price, which asks you to add up the price of different fruits in your basket.   In each game, you earn extra time for going on a tear and answering a specific number of questions or solving a set number of puzzles in a row. The longer you can stay in the mini-game, the more points you earn. (Points in Energy are measured as Brain Watts, which fits nicely with the electricity theme.) If you keep on keepin' on, you'll get enough gold medals to unlock the entire game over the course of a little over a week. You don't have to play Energy day after day, either. You can pop in and out of however you choose. You can go for the big test in Daily Exercise, or just practice a mini-game.   The game is hosted by Dr. Bulbert. Bulbert is decidedly more colorful and animated in Energy, as if Digital Chocolate realized that an entertaining mascot is a good way to set the game apart from the category leader, Brain Challenge. The entire game is rich in color and pleasing sound -- a huge step-up from the original, more clinical Brain Juice.  If you haven't suffered from brain training fatigue or are just checking out the genre in mobile for the first time, you only have two choices: Brain Juice Energy and Brain Challenge. Each game has a great collection of tests, good scheduling, and nice presentation. As I mention in the review, there is really only one dud event in Energy -- and the last time I checked, 11 out of 12 is still a solid grade... which is also what I'm giving Brain Juice Energy. This is a good use of $5.", "date": "Apr 10, 2007"}
