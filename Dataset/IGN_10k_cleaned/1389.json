MLB '98 has everything you could possibly want in a baseball game.  MLB '98 has the complete MLB license and features all the usual standards that belong in the dug-out: stat tracking, trade options, and our personal favorite, editing players. There is nothing better than putting yourself up to the plate against Randy Johnson - and hitting a homer.  As far as graphics go, the on-field players move exceptionally well. In fact, some of the star players have signature stances and pitching wind-ups. In addition to that, while at the plate, the in-fielders will kick dirt away and hit their gloves. Attention to detail was obviously high on Sony's list of what makes a good game great.  Gameplay is one of MLB '98's finer qualities. As opposed to pad-represented base throwing, MLB '98 uses a button-to-base throwing method. Pressing the triangle button to throw to second base, the X button to home, etc., offers an alternative play style that may take a little getting used to, but is one that we particularly prefer.  Next generation baseball games are finally starting to flourish, and MLB '98 is a fine example of how far baseball games have come. So slap on your batting gloves, ladies and gentlemen, this is the ball game to get.    PSX Staff", "date": "Jul 24, 1997"}
