{"name": "Half-Life: Blue Shift", "name_review": "Half-Life: Blue Shift", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/12/half-life-blue-shift", "text": "Half-Life was undeniably one of the best and most popular first person shooters ever.  So popular, in fact, that Sierra and partners are churning out Half-Life this and Half-Life that at an alarming rate.  You can't turn your head in a software store today without coming across a new Half-Life expansion, add-on, mod, gem-emblazoned precious metal edition, or Headcrab-flavored cereal (okay, maybe not so much the cereal, although Headcrab Crunchies sounds like it would do well with the New England crowd to me).    Now we have Half-Life: Blue Shift -- a stand-alone simultaneous telling of the orginal Black Mesa episode seen through the eyes of one of the security guards working at the facility.  What originally began as a bonus pack for the Dreamcast adaptation of Half-Life, Blue Shift has oddly enough come to the PC first, and may not ever see the light of day for the system it was originally planned for.     As you probably already know from the preview, in Blue Shift you play as Barney Calhoun, the nervous yet rugged security guard from the original, who happens to be working the rather chaotic day Gordon Freeman accidentally opened an inter-dimensional gateway between the alien world of Xen and rural Nevada.  Barney begins his journey to work much like Gordon did, in a tram that takes him deep into the secretive yet now well-known Black Mesa Research Facility.  As a matter of fact, you'll run across some familiar faces from the Half-Life universe, including Gordon himself, that creepy pale guy who works for ~The Man,~ and those pesky special service creeps from Opposing Force sent in to do a little ~clean up~ after all hell breaks loose.  Gameplay is pretty much what we've come to expect out of Half-Life -- lots and lots of aliens and gunplay. Developer Gearbox was responsible for Opposing Force, so they know how a Half-Life game is supposed to work.  While Blue Shift is a shooter at heart, there's plenty of tricks and puzzles to figure out as you continue to progress on your goal of escaping Black Mesa.  And all in all, these conundrums were all logical and well done, although some of the jumping puzzles were frustrating as you can't see your feet to tell where they should be when you land, plus I've always found Half-Life to be a bit heavy on the ~rollerskate~ feel.  Blue Shift also keeps up the epic feel from the original, and there's plenty of plot and scripted sequences to keep you grounded in the backstory, however the epic is much, much shorter this time around.  So short in fact that even novice FPS players will be able to finish Blue Shift in just a couple of sittings, or one sitting if they're so inclined -- and have a strong bladder.  Although I didn't keep track of my playing time to the minute, I finished Blue Shift in two sessions, for a combined total of about six hours.  Now I know that it was originally planned as simply a little extra for Dreamcast owners, but selling a six-hour expansion Half-Life to PC gamers for $30 seems a little excessive to me.  On the good side of things, Blue Shift does give the aging Half-Life engine a bit of a facelift with the High Definition Pack (HDP).  One of the biggest draws for Half-Life fans will be the HDP, because it boosts the visual quality both the character models and weapons in Blue Shift as well as in the original Half-Life and Opposing Force.  Speaking of Opposing Force, a full copy of the expansion is included with Blue Shift, so while there are no new multiplayer options to extend your gaming dollar, at least you can lengthen your play time with OpFor if you don't already own it.  And those of you who do will be happy to hear that Sierra is offering a $10 rebate if you send in your Opposing Force CD.  All in all, Blue Shift was a lot of fun, but it was just over too quick. It's certainly worth taking a look at if you're a fan of Half-Life, but you better keep your eyes open, because if you blink you may miss it.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?

When it comes to first-person shooters, Half-Life may indeed be yesterday's pop star, but Sierra's stunning first-person shooter hasn't aged a bit. The gameplay still represents some of the finest there is on the planet, and after 50 ~game of the year awards~ and ~best game ever~ trophies, it's quite unanimous that Half-Life is a one-of-a-kind title. On PS2, Half-Life also is one of the best-produced and best-looking games on the PlayStation 2. The menu and interface design are impeccable, and the load and save times are amazingly quick, which gamers such as myself are truly grateful for. The PS2 version, as I have said, runs at a crisp 60 fps, and looks clean, sharp, and unique in background and character design. And while I'm not a big fan of two-player deathmatches (I don't know a whole lot of folks who are), the Head-to-Head levels will entice some small group of folks, and if it's simply to just enjoy more of Half-Life's essence, then so be it. Decay, the co-op mode, is also sort of neat in its own limited way, that might engage casual gamers more than those known as the hardcore. All in all, Half-Life is the best first-person shooter on PlayStation 2 to date, tying Red Faction in score because of its rather old age (like I said, it is three years old). Gearbox has performed beautifully on every level in its delivery of the brilliant PC game; I would go as far as to say that this is the best PC port I have ever seen on a console. So yeah, if you own a PS2 and you dig first-person shooters, you should absolutely do yourself the favor and get a copy of Half-life ASAP.", "date": "Jun 12, 2001"}
