If you're not scared of it when you can see it and know what it is, why then should you be scared of it even if you can't see it?   There's a large hole in that logic though What if whatever is making that noise in the dark simply wasn't there in the light? What if it was laying, hiding, unseen, and only decided to make its presence known when you couldn't see? Do you shrug it off and investigate later, or do you risk trying to find the source of those noises?   Scratches, an adventure game developed by Nucleosys and published by Got Game Entertainment, decides to tackle that very question head-on. The result, ironically, is just what those psychologists were trying to tell us: once you turn on the lights and get down to it, the results tend to be a bit uninteresting.    Obviously it's a complete injustice to give away much of a story in an adventure game, but we'll speak briefly about the setup. You take the role of Michael Arthate, a novelist specializing in horror and mystery. After writing a decent debut novel and getting more than your fair share of attention and profits, you decide to buy an old and abandoned Victorian house in some backwoods village of England. Inside, you hope to find inspiration for the ending of your latest book, one which you trust will launch you into authors' stardom.   Arriving at the mansion, you're surprised to see that the house is in pretty rotten condition. Still, it has an odd allure, and being awfully curious, you begin to poke around and search the house. After leafing through some journals and other materials around the many rooms of the house, you start to realize that some very bizarre events had taken place to the previous owners.   And that's all we'll say about the story's specifics. Adventure games live and die by their narrative. As far as suspense and terror goes, we're happy to report that there's definitely something creepy about your environment. Although we'll elaborate more on the tangible things in a moment, know that the story alone will be enough to keep you on edge for the duration of the game.   Probably the biggest, greatest feature of the story is the absolutely delicious pacing. This isn't an award-winning piece of narrative -- it gets just a tiny bit predictable in places -- but from beginning to end it's a well-written story with essentially two (and only two) strange twists. One of the creepiest things about the narrative is how much it resides in the past rather than the present.   It's a good thing the presentation and story are strong because Scratches is your typical adventure game as far as gameplay is concerned. Click, click, find an item, click, click, figure out how to use that item, click, click. Even saving the game doesn't involve naming your save slot, so you'll never have to touch the keyboard. Although the box may say ~non-linear gameplay,~ the truth is that you have to click certain things at a time. It's only non-linear in the sense that, if you need to click ten things to advance to the next part of the story, you can click those ten things in any order you wish.   The gameplay fully revolves around the story and in trying to determine how all the items you find in-game relate to it. Can item X combine with item Y to make item Z? And then, where does item Z go? In this room, or the first room? Maybe a room you haven't seen yet?   Not all adventure games are created equal, and the problem with most of the bad ones is that the items are illogical, and/or not enough hints are given. Scratches is terrific about this: there is not a single red herring inventory item, and 99% of the puzzles are logic-based more than ~click a bunch of times and see what actually works~-based. There's only one puzzle toward the end that reeks a little of pixel-hunting, and even then it's not too bad.   That said, finding inventory items can be a little of a chore. Most items are rather obvious, but some things that seem helpful are not items while some things that seem pointless are necessary. Perhaps slightly for the worse, all items in the game are necessary to complete it (hence no red herrings), but that means some are easy to miss. Also, some items are clearly visible from the beginning, but you won't know they're necessary until late in the game. This leads to a lot of backtracking, which can be annoying.   In fact, perhaps the game's greatest gameplay weakness is, ironically, its setting. You'll never leave the grounds of the mansion, so you'll see the same rooms dozens of times until you're done, especially if you get stuck. There are a few buildings outside the house itself that you'll visit, but you'll only need to visit them each one or two times.    It's a shame, really, because the graphics in this game are very good. Remember back in the days of Resident Evil 2, developer Capcom used a creepy door-opening screen to hide the frequent loading times? In Scratches, you'll get to see a peek around the door every time you open one. It happens almost enough times to be annoying, but it stays just shy of the line and is short enough of a scene to be forgiven; not to mention, it's melded seamlessly with the rest of the environment.   This door trick is one of many minor graphical wonders that will help keep your pulse up. There is practically no animation aside from those door scenes, but each individual scene is beautifully created. You'll feel like you're in a physical old house, not a computer facsimile of one. All rooms look very ~lived in~ and detailed: you can almost see the dust layers covering every inch of the forgotten rooms, while the main rooms look fresh from the cleaning ladies that had been through it the few days before. Not mention that you'll be seeing all this in first-person; although, because it is all just art, reflections and shadows are non-existent, which breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit.   Pretty much the only problem with the graphics is that you cannot change the way they look. On a 15-inch flatscreen monitor, they're not so bad. But if you're used to having Windows on something like 1280x1024, it may start to look a little rough. I suppose that can't be helped in a game where art is static. That said, it's still good 2D art.    Helping to round out the atmosphere is the sound. The music is haunting, and it knows when to be gentle and when to crescendo into a blaring climax to force you to jump out of your chair. If you have your computer audio set up in surround sound, you'll really be in for a treat.   The sound effects are rather simplistic, but they need to be for atmosphere like this. Ticking clocks and your own footsteps will normally be what tickles your eardrums, although everything you interact with will make some sort of noise.   We only have two major complaints about the sound. First, there are times when the game is simply too silent. Perhaps that's a contradiction, but the fact is that the puzzles can be a little challenging and you may get stuck a few times, causing you to backtrack. Most pieces of the score tend to only play once or twice until you do something important, so if you get stuck and just explore a room a hundred times, you'll have nothing to break the silence. Perhaps it was an intentional design decision, but it's not one I particularly appreciate.   The second complaint is that Scratches relies on cheap tricks to get jolts. It's human nature to jump whenever a loud noise breaks silence. Horror movies tend to use the same metallic shriek that sounds like a rusty sword is being pulled from a scabbard made of rocks, and Scratches does the same thing. It's not precisely a bad thing, it's just unfair; one should be able to make us jump because of the situation, not because some loud noise got pumped through our speakers. To be fair, the absolute most terrifying moments of the game are from sight, not sound, which I believe is how it should be.   All interacting dialogue is spoken, and for the most part generally well-acted. Narration (such as your character saying ~I wonder what this does?~) is not voiced, which is just as well. The actor for your alter-ego overdid it, sounding more like he's mocking the genre's devices rather than living them. Everyone else who is voiced does a fine job, although this isn't exactly Metal Gear Solid work.Mediocrity is hard to choke down, especially in the gaming industry. All told, Scratches is a good game for what it is, but let's not kid ourselves here: it still suffers from the limitations of the strict point and click adventure genre. At best, it's an above-average interactive book though in the grand scheme of gaming, it is fairly average next to games such as Grand Theft Auto, Half-Life 2, God of War, et al.This is not an easy game. Even with hints enabled, first-time adventure gamers wont know what they're doing and will quickly become frustrated. If youve never looked at adventure games before and can stomach 1987-caliber graphics, head to Google and find the Rob Blanc or Larry Vales series. They're free, and a heck of a lot easier to deal with than this one. If you don't like adventure games at all, dont even bother.However, if you're an adventure gaming veteran, especially if you like the horror / creepy / gothic-type atmosphere, then Scratches is for you. It's a solid game although a bit on the short side as you may be able to get through it in less than a day. At the end, there are certainly a lot worse ways to spend the standard bargain price of $20. This is a pretty decent-good entry in the adventure genre thanks to some good presentation and interesting puzzles.", "date": "Mar 7, 2006"}
