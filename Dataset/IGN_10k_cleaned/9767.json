Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/14/girls-incteam-up-review", "text": "Video games don't exactly have a reputation for being the entertainment medium of choice for little girls, but as casual games rise and more and more families look to the console as a source for fun at home, this is changing. Guppy Games believes that change in the tide can also apply to mobile, and it's the driving force behind TeamUp, a puzzle game that bears the Girls Inc. branding, a popular destination for younger women. This is a game that emphasizes cooperation and problem-solving, as three girls with different talents work through a series of challenges together.   Admittedly, I am not the target audience for TeamUp, as I am an adult male, but I can certainly appreciate well-made casual games. TeamUp, developed for the PC by Large Animal Games and for mobile by Zio, is not the most revolutionary puzzle game ever conceived, but it has a real charm to it and I found many of the 50 puzzles inside the game very interesting.   The goal on each board in TeamUp is to get all three girls to the exit, so they can make a break for the next stage. The exit is, of course, immediately inaccessible. By utilizing the three talents of each girl, such as the ability to push a block or throw another girl over a gap, the path to the exit can be eventually revealed. The stages are littered with crates, rivers, switches, and collectibles -- none of these environments are dull or sterile.   I mentioned that TeamUp doesn't exactly break new ground with its main game, but certain handsets do support a very cool board creator toolbox that lets you assemble your own boards and challenges. You begin with a blank slate and get to fill in impassable water, place the three girls around the board, and add in all sorts of obstacles and interactive features. It's easy to create these boards on your phone -- the only real limit is your thought process. If you have a good head for puzzles, you can really put together some devious stages. Once finished, you can upload the map to a server so other TeamUp players can try it out on their own handset.  TeamUp is a pleasant little puzzler that doesn't rattle too many conventions, but is clever nonetheless. I like the emphasis on getting the girls to cooperate and use their talents in tandem. (This is the message I assume you are suppose to carry over into the real world.) The game is colorful and clean, and I think any puzzle fan will find something to dig into here.", "date": "Dec 14, 2007"}
