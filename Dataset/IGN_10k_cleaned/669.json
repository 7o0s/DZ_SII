Worms Armageddon is the latest in the continuing series that mixes the cutsiness of Lemmings with the violence of Saturday Morning cartoons. Unfortunately, if you've never been introduced to the whole Worms universe, the Game Boy Color rendition isn't the one to jump head first into  the game is so scaled back that the unique character is somewhat lost in the translation.   Features: Turn-based action/strategy For one or two players 14  weapons Only for Game Boy Color  Worms Armageddon is, at its core, a glorified redesign of the classic Artillery game that made the rounds on the 8-bit computers years ago. You remember the type: tanks on either side of the screen, taking turns calculating the pitch and power of the cannon to take the other person out. See, you control an army of brutal worms that weild some serious power under their hidden belts. Not only can each of these worms fire weapons from a distance, they can utilize their limited time to move into a more strategic spot to nail their opponents.   The whole deal is to eliminate the opposing worm army by doing all sorts of things to the soldiers -- calculating the trajectory of long distance weaponry, creeping up behind them and nailing 'em with a baseball bat, rebounding grenades and getting the heck out of the way. The game is turn-based, which means you have a certain amount of free time to plot out your single worm's strategy. If a worm's strength goes from 100 to 0, they're out of the game. You can also take them out by knocking them off the ledges into the water below.  The Game Boy Color rendition is sort of an abridged edition of the overall game. Sure it's got the worms and the quirky graphics, as well as the challenge,  but it lacks the exaggerated flair of the PC game. First of all, the game doesn't feature all the weapons or items in the game. Yes, it's got the exploding sheep and banana bombs, but the ninja rope (an important element that enables you to scale up walls and cliffs) has been omitted, as has some of the stranger weapons like the kamikaze old lady. The game's front end feels extremely thrown together, lacking any of the cool ~missions~ of the PC game  you simply jump into a battle with your oppoinent on a random field. The Game Boy Color game also lacks the personality of the cute, high-pitched worm voices, not to mention the explosions are very basic (almost to the point of non-existent) and add nothing to the brutal nature of the game.  Worms: Armageddon also features a two-player mode, but you have to play Hot Potato with the one system, passing it back and forth between the two when it's the other person's turn. No link cable mode? For shame, Infogrames.  Though the game lacks a lot of the PC design, Worms: Armageddon is still fun to play. I'm just bummed that the Game Boy Color, a system that's made for this type of game, can't handle all that the PC and N64 versions are. It makes me curious to find out if the omissions were because of a lack of time or lack of experience with the Game Boy Color hardware.", "date": "Jan 29, 2000"}
