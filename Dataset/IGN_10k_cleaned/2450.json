He died and left you a bit of money to spend on his one true dream -- building the world's greatest golf course. That's the premise behind this latest game from game guru Sid Meier. And while it's not the revelation on the level of Pirates or Civilization, it's a damn addictive game that will have you calling in sick to work and taking your meals at your computer.  There are sixteen different locations around the world that you can buy to create your course. Each course comes with one of four themes: Links, Parkland, Desert or Tropical. Each has unique geography and unique scenery objects. At first you can only afford the most basic lots for your courses but, as you earn more and more money, you can buy new lots. To start with, you'll have a small lot with few perks. But as you grow your course, you'll earn more money.  If you impress the county commissioner, he may even approve an expansion to your course. Once you have more land, you can build more holes and earn more money to buy more land to build more holes, and so on up until your eighteenth hole. At this point, you can save the course for championship play and move on to purchase an entirely new lot. It seems sort of strange to me but you can't go back and edit a course once you move on to a new one. It makes sense from a game design standpoint, because it forces you to keep a positive cash flow. But it really restricts your ability to refine and fine tune more than one course at a time.  In keeping with the Sim license, the game doesn't necessarily have a predetermined objective. Basically, you're sort of expected to make your own fun with this one. There are no scenarios as in Roller Coaster Tycoon or Theme Park, but the open-ended nature of the ~create a kick-ass golf course and have some fun~ game model is refreshing for me. The game becomes about whatever you'd like it to be about. Some players don't enjoy the whole ~do your own thing~ thing, but the game is straightforward enough that you can feel out your own standards of success.  The game does require you to make money however. (You can play in the sandbox mode, where everything is free but you run the risk of me calling you a lazy cheater.) Each course requires a certain amount of upkeep, which you must cover in green fees and tournament winnings. It seems like the medium difficulty setting is a little too easy, and the game is much more more satisfying on the difficult setting.  You'll be able to create your own pro to play through the various courses and tournaments in the game. You can customize your appearance and improve your varied golfing skills. With each career-accomplishment (such as creating your first six-hole course, or your first dog leg right) you get bonus points to increase your abilities.  Actually playing your course can be quite fun (although you can't play single holes for some reason). The interface is pretty basic and relies a lot on the environment and your skills. The player's reactions and skill don't affect the shot at all. You choose one of five types of shots (drive, draw, fade, backspin and punch) and choose the target. But although that's all there is to it, it's still pretty damn addictive.  But the real fun of the game is making your individual holes. The toolset for this is pretty straightforward. You start with a tee tile and a hole tile. Between them you can place different types of fairway or green, rough, sand traps, pot bunkers and all kinds of rocks and foliage. The basic setup is relatively unrestricted. You can design some really exotic or simple holes that are equally playable and enjoyable.  You can raise and lower the terrain the course is built on to create blinds, hills or valleys. Slopes can really add a layer of difficult to a hole that requires golfers to place their shots more strategically. Each hole is rated in terms of fun, cost and revenue but there are other equally important factors to consider. Each hole can possess one of three attributes -- length, accuracy and imagination -- that give an advantage to particular golfers.  Better yet, you can change all the features of a hole in real time, as it's being played. Move a sandtrap or add a tree; lower an edge of the green or run a stream across the fairway. The only things you can't do are adding more green or moving the tee or hole. To do this, you have to reset the stats on the hole to zero. You can even check the stats of each hole individually and find out what your golfers are saying about it.  We found that the game sometimes routed a path to the green by relaying off the fairway of another hole. Now, I'm no Lee Travino, but I'm pretty sure that's illegal in real golf, so it ought to be illegal in the game. Some other drive routing issues will plague you until you learn how the game operates. The ~face~ of the tee tile turns towards the hole. This is simple enough as it is, but it makes the creation of dog leg courses rely a bit too much on intuition. In any case, you'll get the hang of it after a while.  You'll also need to create a series of holes that flows well and offers a chance for golfers of all skill levels and temperaments to show off their stuff. If you've got too many easy or hard holes in a row, people get pissed. Place a hard hole right after an easy one and you'll get a back up of players waiting to play the hard hole.  The various holes have to be tied to your clubhouse with a network of paths. I really wish a drag option had been included for road creation, because placing each little tile is a real pain in the ass. (On the same subject a draggable bulldoze command might be nice too.)  While the game uses pretty much the same interface from The Sims, it could use a bit of adjustment here. First, you can't place objects unless you're in the zoomed-in view. This makes laying out large courses a bit of a pain as you can only concentrate on a small area of the course. You can't access golfer profiles directly from the main map if they're standing on a tee or the hole and, although this information is accessible elsewhere, it would be nice if you could check someone's attitude as they're driving or putting. Still, the interface seems much more familiar after the first few hours (but this is largely due to your understanding of how to work around some its problems).  It's worth mentioning that the game also comes in the new, smaller boxes. Right on. While it's still not the DVD boxes that I'm still waiting for, the new smaller boxes are much better.  It seems as if you're able to customize the names and appearances of all of the players on your golf course. I would love nothing more than designing a golf course and then inviting all the lovely IGN editors to come and play on it. Sadly, the customization options seemed to work rather sporadically, sometimes allowing me to customize the appearance or the name of a character -- sometimes both, sometimes neither.  The golfers play in pairs and you can monitor their progress and attitude throughout the round. Small comments appear above their heads to let you know what they're thinking. Most of these statements just let you know how a player feels about a particular scenery object or a particular hole. More humorous are the stories that play out between the players. If you get the right pairings, you can follow some really interesting stories, from transvestites discovering their mutual attraction to foreign spies selling weapons plans. If all goes well these two players can even have a ~happy ending~ that adds prestige to your course.  Although we haven't experienced them ourselves, there are a few substantial technical issues that we've heard about. A few gamers are experiencing crashes to the desktop as a consequence of beginning a tournament. Usually you can go back to a manually saved game and rerun the tournament again. But since not everyone habitually saves their game like I do, this could cause quite a headache.  There's been a bit of confusion about the tournaments as well. Some players have noticed that the tournaments stop running for no apparent reason. The reason is actually simple: until you meet the standards of the SGA you can't have a tournament. And the tournament requirements are very different depending on how many holes you have. Check that, how many holes your golf course has. Hopefully you just have the five.  Most of you can expect a bit of a slowdown here as well. It's not so noticeable until you've got a large course with lots of players. At that point, even on the ~recommended~ spec, the game starts to chug a bit. Since there's no way to lower the screen resolution in the game, there's not much you can do about it except make your course so crappy that half your members resign. It's not a great fix, but it works.  The number of games that cross my desk once and never return is considerable. SimGolf has managed to rework my review schedule so I can play some more. On the surface it's a very simple game with very few ~rules.~ But this is what makes the game so sophisticated and so addictive. It's almost instantly and intuitively understandable but the relationships between the various aspects of the game are quite complex. If you can put up with some small irritations in the interface (and the code) then you'll be rewarded with a charmingly addictive game that lets you make your own fun.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
