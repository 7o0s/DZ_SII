{"name": "WWF Warzone", "name_review": "WWF Warzone", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/13/wwf-warzone-2", "text": "As professional wrestling becomes increasingly more popular, more and more game-makers are basing their titles around the sport. THQ, utilizing the WCW (World Championship Wrestling) license, introduced the first wrestling game for Nintendo 64 last year in WCW/NWO: World Tour and the title consequently sold like crazy. Acclaim aims to do the same with WWF Warzone, its Iguana West-developed wrestler based around, you guessed it, the WWF (World Wrestling Federation).  The Facts   Nearly 20 official WWF wrestlers playable plus bonus hidden characters. Polygonal 3D engine. Motion-captured wrestlers. Game runs in medium-resolution mode. More than 300 moves plus signature moves. Finishing moves and taunts for each wrestler. Two-man commentary featuring Vince McMahon and Jim Ross. MIDI renditions of wrestlers' theme music. Nine gameplay modes including WWF Challenge, Versus, Tag Team, Cage, Weapons, Royal Rumble, and exclusive to N64, Gauntlet.  Grudge Matches. Hands-on Training Mode. Detailed Create-a-wrestler feature. Wrestler biographies. High Scores listing. Four-player multiplayer mode. Rumble Pak support. Memory Pak support.   The Wrestlers The game features nearly 20 wrestling athletes from the World Wrestling Federation. Notice that some, like Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels and British Bulldog, are still included in Warzone despite the fact that they defected to the WCW. Chalk that up to development time folks. Wrestlers featured include Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Mosh, Thrasher, Kane, Shamrock, The Undertaker, Owen Hart, Bret Hart, Ahmed, The Rock, Mankind, Triple H, Goldust, Faarooq, British Bulldog, as well as hidden characters Dude Love and Cactus Jack. And then, of course, there's the create-a-wrestler feature which we'll get to in just a bit. Overall, not a bad selection, but Warzone will still be very hard-pressed to compete with the likes of THQ's upcoming WCW/NWO Revenge in sheer amount of athletes, which boasts more than 80 official wrestlers. On the other hand, the WCW doesn't have Stone Cold.   The Game Warzone features seven gameplay modes. There's the standard challenge in which players must choose a wrestler and advance through the federation, eventually securing themselves a belt. The challenge comes complete with grudge matches and all. This mode also unlocks the game's secret characters and codes. In Versus mode, players can go a single match with a wrestler without the hassle of the WWF Challenge. Tag Team mode enables two-on-two matches. Steel Cage mode is somewhat self-explanatory. Players duel inside a giant steel cage and the first man to make it out is the winner. In weapons mode, wrestlers use a variety of different painful objects to their advantage, including chairs, tables, televisions and bells. The game's Royal Rumble pits two players in a ring and throws new wrestlers their way every 90 seconds or so. And exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version of Warzone, Gauntlet mode. With all of these modes of gameplay we do have one big gripe: players cannot select their computer-controlled opponent. For example, let's say that players wanted to pit Stone Cold against The Undertaker in a single-player game. There's no option to make it a reality. We're not sure what Iguana West was thinking when it failed to include such a simple addition.   Once players choose a wrestler and gameplay mode the match begins. Nintendo 64 owners will quickly notice that Warzone plays nothing like THQ's offering. The touch-and-go grappling system of World Tour is not present. Instead, Warzone relies on set button-sequence moves that must be learned to be performed. For example, to execute a neck breaker, players must press left, left and B in sequence. A DDT, on the other hand, is performed by pressing left, down and A in sequence. Many wrestling fans may be turned off by Warzone's system, but we prefer it. Button-sequence moves, once mastered, reward the skilled player. While wrestlers control precisely and move at a moderate pace, there are a few glitches that can be frustrating. The game's collision detection engine could have done better with a little more fine-tuning before release; depending on what direction wrestlers are facing they will punch through an opponent into another. To correct the problem, players must reposition their wrestler to face their desired opponent via the camera buttons. Once learned the problem melts away into a minor annoyance, but the system is highly unintuitive all the same. Other than that we have no complaints.  There are more than 300 moves including signatures. There's the Stone Cold Stunner, the Tombstone, the Mandible Claw, so on and so forth. And then there's an amazing selection of league moves including DDTs, Suplexes, slams, chokes and reversals -- more than 40.Each move is detailed in the game's helpful practice mode.  Graphics Let's face it, people sometimes watch movies for the special effects, people do judge books by their covers and people play games based on their graphics. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up for debate, but Warzone's realistic look and unsurpassed visuals are not. Put simply, Warzone makes WCW/NWO World Tour look like a 16-bit classic in comparison. How is this achieved? Motion-captured wrestlers, digitized texture-maps, well constructed 3D polygon models and lots of time perfecting animation routines all wrapped up under a detailed, flexible soft-skinned package. As if all of the above weren't enough, Warzone runs in medium-resolution mode. While the graphics outshine the PlayStation version during gameplay, cut-scenes are lacking animation and decidedly ugly. That said, this is still the best looking wrestling game ever made.  Sound Each wrestler sports his own custom theme music in MIDI form, but that's not what sets this game apart in the sound department. What does is its commentary, wrestler taunts and crowd reactions. Vince McMahon highlight the wrestling action with comments like, ~This is good old JR!~ and ~[wrestler] can't shake the cob-webs off!~ Steve Austin will shout catch phrases, ~Oh hell yeah!~ and ~Don't take this ass whoopin' personally son,~ at opponents. Even the crowd gets into the action, calling out, ~Oh hell yeah!~ or chanting, ~Stone Cold!~ repeatedly during a bout. If a player ~cheeses~ an opponent by simply punching him repeatedly the crowd will boo him and as a result his opponent will become stronger. It's all very well executed.  Create-a-Player Feature Hands down, Warzone's create-a-player feature is the game's winning moment. Not only does it enable players to keep adding more and more wrestlers to their league (30 custom wrestlers can be saved to memory pak), but it expands the game's life and replay value tenfold. All of the following can be customized: name, attributed, personality, theme music, gender, skin color, skin type, body type, head, upper body and lower body. Digging a bit more deep into the feature, there are six different skin colors; three skin types including plain, hairy and ripped; five different body builds including average, skinny, muscle, heavyweight and super heavyweight; upper body includes tanktops, shirts, jackets, gloves, armpads, accessories, tattoos, and neck; lower body boasts shorts, long shorts, pants, belts, shoes, boots, kneedpads, accessories and tattoos. Bear in mind, there are tens of choices for each sub-category. The end result are custom wrestlers  that can be tailored to look like friends and family, ultimately making for great wrestling fun One complaint: players can't assign custom-tailored moves to their created wresters. Rather, they can only choose an official wrestler's set move list. For example, players can't compile a DDT, a neck breaker and the Stone Cold Stunner and throw them all together in their own customized list. They can only select the complete move list for Undertaker, StoneCold and so on.  This is a great game with a few flaws. We admire Iguana's decision to go with button-sequence gameplay mechanics and visually, well, nothing even comes close. It even sounds great. That said, here's our gripes: a sometimes flawed collision detection system and the lacking ability to select computer-controlled opponents in a single-player match. Some may add a third complaint with Warzone's decidedly slim selection of official wrestlers, but considering the game's ingenious create-a-player feature we're more than happy. Highly recommended. I can't wait to see what Iguana West pulls off for the sequel.", "date": "Aug 13, 1998"}
