In some cases, a development team can come in, take a concept, and juice it up until there's no possible way you could ever go back to the original.   Then there's the efforts that make you wonder if the developer has something against old school fans that they neglected to mention to our friendly neighborhood publisher.  I played the snot out of the original pod, so I figured that with the early builds looking positive, the addition of weapons, and some shortcut-happy tracks, Pod: Speedzone could be nothing short of brilliant in light of its online aspirations and DC-enhanced look.  Of course, I forgot to factor in the developer's complete lack of a clue of what makes a racing game fun.  Silly me.  Actually, it's UbiSoft that should be feeling silly, truth be told.  This games was so close to being incredibly cool, but some key screw-ups along the way make it one of the Dreamcast's most disappointing titles of the year.  Visually, the game has a decent framerate, that runs along at an excellent clip about 90% of the time.  The texture work and lighting effects are above average, and even the weapons effects look pretty cool.  Then, we take a look at the cars, and things get uglier than the love child of Gilbert Godfrey and Linda Tripp.  I am not sure who got a hold of these vehicles, but they are just plain booty.  The original game's cars were nothing special, but at least some of them were cool-looking.  These things?  Like, one of them avoids looking like a ballooney, mess, and to be honest, I am not sure who thought these were hip.  No thank you.  To make matters worse, the way these globs of mobile metal move is just as frustratingly bad.  I am not sure how they managed it, but these things somehow manage to simultaneously too heavy for precise turns yet too light to avoid being bounced and thrown around the track every time you hit a pebble with the far edge of your tire. The game ends up controlling like a hyper-sensitive RUSH, and to be honest, it is a bit too frustrating for its own good.    Reason being that the game's tracks are often too narrow to negotiate without some serious turning skills, as they are extremely narrow. The cars themselves usually take up over half the track, which means they have trouble nailing a tight turn, and if they are in the middle of the track, can be very difficult to pass.  And when you collide with either another car or a wall, it is really hard to stay on course.  The end result is a race filled with one too many spin outs and flipped vehicles, which slows the game down.  This is too bad, really, because the game does excel at a few things, namely track design, which offers a number of shortcuts and interactive elements, as well as a great sense of speed. The secret paths can be hit with some practice, and add a lot to gameplay in that you never know where an opponent will go in an effort to avoid losing the lead, and this adds a lot to the online elements of the game.  Every moves by at an incredible pace, as well, so the decision making required to really give someone a good race is intense to say the least.  A lot of things get in the way here, however.  As I mentioned before, the tracks are narrow, and other cars will constantly get in your way, no matter how careful you are.  Each track features a number of random elements that can wreck the inattentive driver, and these end up doing more harm than good as the collision for most of these roadblocks is just horrible.  Bombs go off when you are nowhere near them, causing you to wreck.  Little robots crawl next to you car, and despite the fact that you clearly miss them, you'll smack right into them.  Things like this slow you down, and ruin one of the game's best elements, as well as eliminating another possible cool aspect to Speedxzone, a double whammy it does not need.    And then we have online play. Unlike most online efforts on Dreamcast to date, there was little in the way of guesswork for UbiSoft's Pod: Speedzone, as the racing genre is much more forgiving in the latency department, as it is much less of an exact science when it comes to player positioning.  In light of this, you'd figure the game would have tons of cool options to make speeding across the 'Net a blast.  Unfortunately, the game has some serious menu issues, and very little in terms of options.   Game lobbies are all ~lockable~ before you start a race, which keeps new players out.  The only trouble is, after you have finished a race, they stay locked, so if anyone leaves or gets disconnected, starting a new race with additional players requires killing that game, and launching a new one.  This makes playing an extended game with your friends a bit tricky.  Ubi did add a championship mode, which allows for multiple races, but if someone gets disconnected and wants to rejoin after a race is over, they are unable to do so because of this lock.  Bummer  The good news is, the online play that is here is pretty slick, and more than acceptable over a modem.  Unlike most other DC online titles, the framerate isn't dependant on your ping, as most info is handled on the clients side and bounced over, so your race will run really smooth. Due to the amount of wrecking that typically goes on, the games are usually pretty competitive, and we played more than one nail-biting fight to the finish, which was pretty cool  Another sweet aspect was the game's point system, in which you're rewarded a number of points per finish in each online race.  These numbers are displayed next to your nickname, as well as on a leader board accessible within the game, and the number of points determine your ranking.  This would have been a cool way to sort players by skill ranking, but much like other aspects we've already harped on, it seems to have slipped the mind of the pod powers that be. Ugh.  The lobby is also a bit lacking with no direct way to chat to other gamers while looking for a game to join, but overall, this is a nice introduction to online racing, albeit a limited, sloppy one.     Much like the newly introduced weapon system.  The original pod lacked weapon-based damage, but Speedzone decided to give it a try.  It might have worked if they had thrown a little variety in here, but a measly 3 power-ups simply does not cut it. The game offers a speed boost, a projectile attack, and a land mine, but no variations on any of them, and as a result, the game's combat system has been simplified to the point of an afterthought.  *sigh*  In the end, I am just let down by the whole experience.  Pod: Speedzone came in with some cool ideas, but ended up being an under-developed game that isn't that fun to play.  The online elements help matters somewhat, but even this side of the game seems like it was one or two simple changes away from being worthwhile.  What you're left with is an average game that could have been so much more, and I am bummed that a little more time wasn't spent with this game, because a few tweaks could have made it a show-stopper.  Ah well...at least there's still hope for Speed Devils Online...  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 14, 2000"}
