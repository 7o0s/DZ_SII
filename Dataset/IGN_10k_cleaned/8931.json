The two platforms are so different in their approach to gaming, yet there's really no reason why there shouldn't be more propagation between the two. X-Com is an excellent example of such cross-breeding.  The PlayStation version of X-Com is basically true to the original, with little or no changes apart from interface modifications (the PlayStation mouse is compatible with the game, and highly recommended). Perhaps a little more could've been done to enhance the PSX version, such as adding new music or punching up the graphics. But these are minor complaints.  As far as story goes, it's great. Aliens invade, and you fight back. Along the way you must also research recovered alien artifacts and handle finances for building new bases and buying new equipment. If you're familiar with PC-style strategy games, you'll undoubtedly pick it up in no time. Strategy fans will love it, and for gamers who've wanted to try something deeper, this may be the title you've been waiting for.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
