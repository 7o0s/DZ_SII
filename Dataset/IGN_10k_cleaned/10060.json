Sadly, that wasn't the case. Zack & Wiki seriously underperformed, while Mario Party 8 was one of the best selling titles of the year. It makes us feel a little sick to be honest.   Why? The Wii needs more titles like Zack & Wiki. It's clever, it's charming, it utilises the Wiimote fantastically well and it's one of the best puzzle games we've played in ages. Yes, a puzzle game. If you've glanced at the screenshots you could be forgiven for thinking that the game was a platformer, or perhaps an RPG. Uh-uh. Zack & Wiki is a puzzle game through and through. Each mission takes place in a single location, and the player's goal is simple  to work out how to get to and open its treasure chest. But we're getting ahead of ourselves.   Oh, and did I mention that Wiki the monkey who's also a bell is also a helicopter?  The story  not that it really matters beyond flavour  sees Zack, a fledgling pirate, and Wiki, a flying monkey who's also a bell (no really), joining the Sea Rabbits, a pirate crew, in search of fame and, of course, fortune. Early in the game they come across their first treasure chest, and what should be inside but the golden skull of the infamous pirate Barbaros, master of Treasure Island. As is the way in videogames, he has been cursed and his pieces scattered to the four winds. Time to track them all down, then.   As mentioned, each has been conveniently deposited in its own treasure chest in its own puzzle area. So far, so familiar. The gameplay, however, isn't. You don't control Zack directly, instead pointing the Wiimote at the screen and directing him using the on-screen icon. The player also has a unique window on the world, with each map viewed from one side. You can switch back to a zoomed out view to get a sense for the level as a whole or to move Zack across a large area, or you can get in nice and close for a good view of Zack's immediate vicinity. Interacting with something in the environment is as simple as clicking on it with the pointer.   So what will you be doing in this vibrant, pirate-filled world? Revelling in clever and engaging puzzle scenarios. Zack & Wiki very much represents classic point-and-click adventure game puzzle design for the modern age; it's all about exploring each area, taking stock of items you can use, then working out how things fit together and in what order. Sounds dry, but it's not at all  it's actually brimming with quirky concepts and plenty of design panache. After all, in how many games do you have a sidekick that can be used as a bell to turn creatures into useful items with a shake of the Wiimote? A centipede becomes a Centi-saw, a frog becomes a Frog Bomb, and a bat becomes a Batbrella. How to use them? Well, a Centi-saw can be used to saw through trees and other items, while a Frog Bomb can be used to blow things up or stun guards. It's the Batbrella, however, that best demonstrates how entertaining it is to solve this game's puzzles. In one scenario you may need to open it while falling from the sky to slow your descent; in another you may flip it around to use its handle as a hook on a flying fox; while still another ingenious puzzle requires you to use it to press an out of reach button, but making sure to nah, don't want to give that one away.    I was given to understand that pirates wore puffy shirts. What's going on Zack?  Items, then, can have a number of uses  not to mention the fact that items created using creatures and pirates can be turned back into their original form with the bell. Gee, I wonder whether that will factor into any puzzles? The Wiimote comes into play heavily too: not only are you shaking it to ring Wiki like a bell, you're using it as a lever and crank, as well as rotating it to align items correctly, making a sawing motion to cut through trees and even adjusting it to focus in the beam of a magnifying glass. Could be gimmicky, but it isn't. And best of all, the visual design is nice and clear cut  you always know what you can interact with and you'll always get feedback if something doesn't work.    Puzzles become more complex and involve more elements as the game moves on, and while the game never introduces time limits or anything silly like that, the team does a good job at introducing urgency in a few of the maps. One level, for instance, is set on a snow-covered area with a robot that regularly moves across the map, sweeping up any footprints you've made. Get caught outside a safe area and he'll whack you into the camera and you'll have to start again (or use a Platinum Ticket  more on that in a sec). It's a clever change of pace because you're forced to plan out each run as you madly dash about in the brief lulls between the robot's insane, sweeping rampages. Despite the pressure, you'll still piece everything together and work out how to beat the robot, and by necessity you'll discover ways to take the pressure off. Shaking a tree, for instance, will dump fresh snow on the ground, covering your tracks and creating an area temporarily safe from Metal Mickey. These kinds of extra layers really do a lot to shift up the gameplay.   Of course, you will fail levels, but in this case, replaying levels is very much all part of the fun when you die early on, that is. For the longer, more involved puzzles it pays to have a stock of Platinum Tickets handy. These puppies are purchased at the Sea Rabbits' HQ and enable you to rewind the game to before your last significant action. Without these the game wouldn't walk the line between fun and frustration quite so deftly.   The Metal Mickey level. Boogie boogie.  It all adds up to a puzzle game that's incredibly satisfying and gratifyingly varied, and importantly, challenging but not frustrating. Zack & Wiki really does succeed in creating a world that doesn't punish the player with needlessly abstruse puzzles  they're multi-faceted, certainly, and at times quite long-winded (massive icicle, I'm looking at you!) but they all invariably make sense within the logic of the world, reveal their elements gradually, and are rewarding to solve. And of course, as you progress, the gameplay changes and evolves.   Zack & Wiki looks wonderful too. The core art design is outstanding, and ably supported by crisp, colourful worlds and some incredibly charming animations. So it's not in high-def  who cares? This game looks great. The characters have a stack of personality too - there's the way Johnny Style zips away after you upend the pot he's in (yes, there's a character called Johnny Style  he's awesome), the way Zack invariably falls into each treasure chest, only to burst out, piece of gold in hand in a clear homage to Link. Hell, even the absurdly cute Wiki is endearing  I'll get you out of that ice block, little fella!   This level has the most elaborate set-up for a game of Whack-A-Mole ever. Zack & Wiki is very much what happens when talented Japanese game designers decide to revisit classic point-and-click adventure gameplay, and proceed to inject it with their own aesthetics and sensibilities, all with a modern coat of paint. Thus, you have super-kawaii characters (including a bourgeois schoolgirl pirate captain), zany, nonsensical voice samples, gorgeously colourful art direction and some of the best puzzles on Wii. It's not all that long, but dont let this one pass you by.", "date": "Feb 22, 2008"}
