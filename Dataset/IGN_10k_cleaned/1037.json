The system sure came out of the gates explosively with the superb rally challenge in the Top Gear game, but every subsequent title just eaked the bar down (except for sequel, which was actually pretty good for different reasons). And now we've arrived at Rally Challenge 2000, which is basically a racer that one might think fit for the beginning of N64's lifespan, not near the end.  The sequel to the slipshod MRC, Rally Challenge 2000 accomplishes a perfect state of average, just like its predecessor. It's perfectly and plainly fine for bottom feeders willing to settle for less without qualm. With graphics that bring back the pea soup left behind with Ridge Racer 64 (or half a dozen N64 racers before that), control that has the finesse of a gear shift, and sleepy track design, Rally Challenge 2000 keeps the N64 stuck in second gear.    The Features:   Nine courses in such countries as America, Spain, Brazil, Italy and other global locales.  Four player multiplayer mode.  Championship mode.  Arcade mode with check points  Versus mode.  Practice mode (Time Attack) to get familiar with car settings.  Officially licensed cars and sponsors like Castrol and Clarion.  Realistic accidents with car damage meters.  Varying weather effects such as snow and rain for all courses.   Gameplay As rally games typically live and die by, the biggest (and only) feature of Rally Championship is the careful detailing allowed over the car's engine and suspension. Taking a page out of the Hitchhiker's Guide to Gran Turismo, Rally Challenge 2000 licenses dozens of real-world automobiles for racing, from stock rally racers down to petty suburban putt-putts and up to swift supercars. Each car has differing talents in suspension, tires, gear ratio, and braking strength, and that further can be tweaked by changing up parameters in the car's options.  That was the best attribute of the original MRC, and again here it makes a world of difference. Choosing the wrong tires on a rainy day will leave you slipping all over the track, and gearing wrong will place you out quickly in the game's Arcade mode. In addition, the cars all take damage in the Championship mode, and that further affects the car's handling and raises the challenge. There isn't visible damage, and you can't be forced out of a race just because your back end is dinged up, but just try turning when your left side has been beat to red levels. You might as well make three rights than wait for your anchored boat to roll around a turn.  But aside from that, the rally racing is lukewarm. Whereas some rally games try to take the honest path in Championship mode (meaning that opponent cars are not on the track, just like real rally racing), Rally Challenge 2000 is the same game in either mode aside from the punishing time limit in the arcade game. The powersliding control is solid, as it was with MRC, but you don't get the same sense of on-the-edge steering that you would with a better rally racer because the tracks are very narrow and have invisible barriers on the edges. You can't spin out and lose control, or slip up the embankment. You simply rub up against the edge of the track and slow down or stop. Sure, it's frustrating in Sega Rally or Collin McRae Rally when you slide into the middle of nowhere, over trees and bushes and into a bog, but that will teach you the hard way not to do whatever you did wrong again. In this game, you're so limited by the width of the track that you can never find out what this baby really can do. <p . mrc suffered a dearth of tracks and rally challenge solves that problem only moderately. there are now nine courses but they dont have any the shortcuts exciting obstacles ridges top gear rally. its an honestly boring game perhaps in keeping with sport other games been able to really milk joy out seemingly dull sport. heck even nascar can be great if done right.  Graphics Yeah boy, we have another winner of the In the Blur contest. Rally Challenge 2000 is thick, hazy, foggy, muted, soupy, blurry, and overall not so sharp. The best draw distance attained is somewhere between 5-10 feet in front of you, and gameplay mainly comes in listening to the froggy announcer call the turns as they pop on screen. There are hazy objects out running somewhere in the cotton-filled horizon, but it won't take too much time before you come to the foolish realization that squinting at a 2D TV screen doesn't make your eyes work better like real life.  And then the developers have the gall to add motion blur to the already fuzzy textures. Replays are just plain pointless, because all you can see is a car floating somewhere lost somewhere Kirby's Dream World. Occasionally a tree or building passes, or rather blurs by, and you figure out that the car must be moving forward.  All this is disappointing, if only because the game has potential to look superb. The background paintings (in their hazy, washed-out state) still come across well, and there are plenty of nice water and building textures when the car is picnicking right by them. The sense of speed is golden, flashing by at tremendous speeds in the in-car view, with every bump coming across as a near-car wreck at this terminal velocity. Dust and water effects are well done, sometimes throwing up so much mess that drivers can get lost. There is also an incredible reflection mapping on the car's mirrored windows, transitioning smoothly in tunnels and off-road. It looks like they took the in-car rearview mirror and just mapped it on the windows (however, opponent cars do not show up in the reflection). Also, while the headlight effects are completely for show (the lights don't even light up the road -- they're just two big yellow polygons protruding from the car's front end, and don't show up in the in-car view), the ability to race any course at night or by daylight and in any weather is a nice option.  Sound Even if a game is average, I wouldn't suggest hiring an average guy to do its sound. The voice used for the navigator is flat-out embarrassing! It's as if somebody weren't so much copying the Ridge Racer voice, but mocking it for a goof. If you've ever done that voice where you pretend to be screaming by just scrunching up your face and making your voice gruff (and we all have), you have some idea of how fakey this guy sounds. His ~Go!~ sounds like he's in a toilet grunting at his turd to get going. [Could have done without that image -- ed]  Outside of the cornball navigator, the rally audio rises back to the level of strictly average, much befitting the game. The music played, and I noticed that it was there, but even when I set out to listen to it for this review, I couldn't even stay aware of it. It's that bland. The effects are a collection of everything you might expect in a rally game, not really nailing the nuances of rally racing, but still suitably leveled to keep you from falling asleep. Yeah, maybe there was a reason why SouthPeak Interactive took the word 'Championship' out of this game's title. It's not a miserable game by any stretch -- the bad fogging can be worked around, the sad audio can be drowned out without missing anything, and the lacking tracks are at least true to the sport. But the game can't rise above mediocrity at any attempt. Against all the other racers on the system, this game has little new to offer and less still besting over the system's champs.", "date": "Jun 22, 2000"}
