With limited availability and virtually no word about the title from Microsoft, it seems Sneakers is being swept under the rug.  While this may seem like a strange tactic for a first-party game, it comes with good reason -- This game is crap.    As Apollo, the alpha mouse leading a rag-tag team of buddy mice, you'll wander town looking to recapture food stolen by some rats.  At least, it seems like the rats stole the food you were going to serve at your big mouse party.  In any event, the rats are bad, the mice are good, and the game is terrible.  Featuring five stages, an endless supply of rats, and countless wasted hours of gameplay, Sneakers may just be the worst first-party game in console history.    Features  Mice looking for rats! Hide-and-seek gameplay using the power of the Xbox! Battle through five massive stages and watch as your will to live is destroyed! 5.1 Dolby Digital mouse squeaks!  Gameplay Eek a mouse! Sneakers is essentially a game of tag.  Your goal is to move around the various stages (Apollo's House, Back Alley, Central Park, Doshi's Cellar, The Bridge) and find the rats lurking about.  While the idea of hunting down rats may sound kind of cool, I assure you, it's not.  How bad is it?  Where to begin... The game is on a track.  You can move forwards or backwards on a line, but you can't move freely about the environment.  You'll come to crossroad points, where you'll be able to choose to go left or right and then continue to follow the track around a 3D environment.  But hey, you can press A and run!  Not only will you be looking for rats, but there are also some scraps of food to be found to help boost your ranking at the end of each stage.  Finding rats isn't so hard.  Many of them will be standing around, apparently scouting for mice.  Sometimes they will look right at you, but it doesn't matter.  They just stand there.  Never moving.  Press X to enter view mode, look at the rat, and press A to select.  Eep! The rat's been found out and he runs away.  One down, twenty-nine more to go.  Yes, the game really is this bad.  Some rats, however, are more clever.  They stand around motionless inside objects.  So when you pass a vase, you'll want to look at the vase and then choose one of your friends to enter a cut-scene where said vase is rattled or pushed over.  The rat then flees.  Twenty-eight to go.  You have a time limit, however, so do not dilly or dally.  But this large time limit increases every time you find another rat so don't stress too much.  Problem is, on almost every level you will get down to the last one or two rats and have no idea where to find them.  You must then try and maneuver your way along these criss-crossing tracks in hopes one of them leads you somewhere substantial.  It can get incredibly frustrating to have ten minutes left and have to waste all of that time trying to track down one or two stray rats.  Fail and you have to start all over again.  Ugh.  Watch the main gameplay in this movie.  Does it get any worse than this?  There's a rat in the kitchen, what am I gonna do? But that's only the first half of Sneakers, there's another, more exciting portion.  Mice, as we all know, love to rumble.  Each level will have you face a couple of different groups of rats in battle.  Fights allow you to roam freely across a small area as you and your buddies try to beat on some rat boys.  You can ~command~ your buddies to attack specific rats in some sort of half-assed attempt at squad-based rodent combat.   In a fight, you have a large variety of moves at your disposal (if you consider four attacks to be ~large~).  You can lock onto a target with the Left Trigger and then punch with A, punch-a-bunch by hitting A repeatedly, do a wind-up punch by holding and releasing A, or pull off a spinning combo punch with B.   The spinning combo is easily the most effective attack and sort of makes the rest of your options irrelevant.  Fights are boring, slow, easy, and boring.  Though the rats seem to be blocking (you can do this by holding down the Right Trigger), it looks like they are cowering.  This makes the sight of your buddies ganging up and beating on a rat, well, sort of horrific.  It's like a gangland street fight where everyone squeaks.  If there is excitement to be found here its -- no wait, there's no excitement to be found here.  After all rats are found and beaten, you'll have to find and beat the boss.  Finding the boss can be a pain in itself.  Though the map indicates which room the final battle is in, it doesn't tell you where to find the boss, exactly.  This means you could wander the room a good five minutes trying to figure out which track takes you the right way.  Fun!  Check out this movie of a Sneakers battle!    Graphics Though Sneakers has fur-shading, which gives these mice some realistic looking fur, it's a poor example of what Xbox can do visually.  With static rooms and characters on a fixed track, there should be no reason for slow down.  But some times, for no apparent reason, the frame rate disappears, dropping to about 2-5 frames a second.  Even the menu screen seems framey at times.  The settings aren't bad, but then, it's all just background filler anyway.  The animations are limited and despite the mice having different clothes and looks, none feel distinct.  Sound Well, it's in 5.1, but why?  I guess if you want to hear squeaks in surround, you're set.  Otherwise, it's pretty pointless to go Dolby Digital here.  The sound effects are minimal, the mice talk in high-pitched squeaks ( I guess that's based on how they hold conversations in real life?), and the music is horribly high-strung.  The score seems like an attempt to one-up Nintendo.  In fact, one of the tracks has an end note that sounds identical to Super Mario Bros..  Bad, bad sound. Sneakers reminds me a lot of E.T. for the Atari.  Both suck and both had you wandering around aimlessly collecting things.  Sneakers should never have even come to the U.S.  I can think of 2000 ways to spend $30, and none of them involve buying Sneakers.  An embarrassment of a game flawed from concept to finished product.  If this was meant to be for kids, it missed the mark.  I played E.T. on Atari, and let me tell you, it sucked.  It was boring and I would have rather been playing Space Invaders.  I was seven then, so I think the experience translates to what a 7-year old would experience playing Sneakers.  Kids want fast and fun (Pokemon and Mario anyone?), they don't want slow, plodding, boring, and unintelligent gameplay.  Just because someone is young, doesn't mean they need things dumbed down.  I plan on burning my copy so that it can't fall into the hands of impressionable children who might then come to think all video games are meant to suck this bad.", "date": "Oct 25, 2002"}
