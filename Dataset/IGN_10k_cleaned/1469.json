Two main divisions between fans of the genre who like their combat structured a certain way, presented a certain way, and played a certain way. Of course the two main schools I speak of are the Zen-like practices of Capcom and SNK; the duel masters of 2D fighting ferocity.  Famous for their line of Street Fighter games and perhaps even more famous for their number of sequels in the franchise, Capcom is considered by many to be the emperor supreme in all manner of the karate battle. Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, and Guile are world renowned for their arena-battle techniques, and to the general public are challenged on that level by no one. On the other end of the spectrum however, you have the SNK fanatics who lounge around in popular obscurity touting the abilities of their Fatal Fury warriors like there's no tomorrow. Andy, Mai, Terry, and Geese are but a few of these unsung champions battling for respect among the King of Fighters naive. But for those of us who have played multiple editions of both companies fighting games we know what the truth really is; Both fighting engines kick major ass.  So what would happen if these two powerhouses collided in a battle to end all battles? What type of unrelenting Jet Li action could be found if the two separate developers with decidedly different agendas were to team up and force their alter egos into a fist-on-foot mini-war? Could Ryu and Ken stand up to the fiery might emblazoned into the souls of Terry and Kyo? Could the god-like powers of Akuma best the evil fury of Iori so consumed by the pain of the Orochi Blood Riot that he can barely stand? Just how much slobbering geek drool could be produced from a single pairing of ~Me Bouncy~ Mai and her Capcom sister cop, Chun Li anyway? The answers were closer than ever thought possible before...  First seen on the ill-fated Neo-Geo Pocket Color, SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium was a critical and popular success. Precursor to the newly released NAOMI-powered arcade machine, the miniaturized version of the subject of our review had almost everything that the fans had wanted (including a large collection of heroes from both developers extensive rosters, arenas from some of the most well known stages in fighting game history, and a creative use for sub-games and team combinations). From the moment we played it, we knew that it would be hard to top that kind of successful collaboration, and even more demanding to do so on the Dreamcast. Luckily, the developers have come through for us, and have done so in spades.  Reborn on the Dreamcast as Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, this 2D pit fighter is an old-school sensei's dream. Essentially The King of Fighters meets Super Street Fighter II: Turbo, the disc seems to borrow all the right elements from its inspirations of the past. Sporting a hefty cast of characters from both franchises all-star team, most of the brawlers to be found will be immediately recognized. And though some of the more unusual fighters from the pocket version have been axed in favor of more realistic members (say goodbye to Haomaru, Felicia, and B.B. Hood), the overall coolness factor when squaring off legends such as these is untarnished. In fact, the experience is sometimes so surreal that you may find yourself asking mommy for a trip to the surgeon. It is perhaps the only way to remove that granite-like grin off of your beleaguered fan boy maw.  Not to say that there weren't a few omissions that had us somewhat taken aback at the fact that they weren't in there. After all, playing an SNK fighter without Shermie, Chris, or Yashiro is a bit on the weird side, and being able to fight as Vice but not Mature is even more baffling (she does make a quick cameo appearance in one of the special intros however). Furthermore the fact that both Dan Hibiki and Joe Higashi are in the game as illustrations and not playable characters chalks in as an immeasurable shame. Disappointing yes, but at least we got Nakoruru and Morrigan right?  Speaking of Nakoruru and Morrigan, they are but two of the game's impressive list of secrets. So large is the list in fact, that it will literally take you weeks (if not months) to unlock everything. Thanks in part to a very unforgiving point system; the player is forced to work their way through thousands of matches before the last of the 77 bonuses can finally be revealed. One of the few weaknesses I found while playing through the Japanese version a few months back, I had hoped that the point collection system would have been refined for its domestic release... Alas, it was not. We are instead set upon a journey that may discourage more players from finding everything than those it encourages. Bummer.  But I offer thee fair advice dear gamers; stay fast! As there a quite a few powerful characters, unique and entertaining stages, and even an alternate soundtrack to be unleashed should you remain diligent. That has to help motivate you if even a little bit, yes?  Graphically, the game would be hard pressed to look any better. With nearly half the Capcom crew redrawn and every last member of the SNK corps redesigned to compliment their crossover opponents (many of these characters have never looked this good). Appearing more like their Anime-inspired cousins, each combatant has more animation and detail than any other 2D offering before it (with the only exception of course, being that of Street Fighter III). Complete with idle animations, special introduction scenes between certain characters, and fluidity not yet seen in a King of Fighters game, the visuals are a definite upgrade.  The biggest of which are the pyrotechnic special effects (that have seemingly been rendered in a quasi-3D fireworks show of Fantasia-like quality). Whether it's Blanka's ~Direct Lightning~ attack or Kyo's ~Shaishuu Kessen Ougi Mu Shiki~ super, the lighting display that follows is truly spectacular. Even the common Fireball and ~Sonic Boom~ projectiles are a sight for sore eyes, as the sparks, embers, and other little details literally jump off the screen and make a b-line for your face. Macho!  And how about those backgrounds? Inspired very loosely by other well-known locales from both franchises, they are filled with personality, color, and the occasional cameo appearance (Yes that's Duck King and Goro Daimon in the Construction stage, and did you spot Yagyu Jubei under that umbrella at the cafe?). Purely two-dimensional like the fighting games of old, just about every arena is a full notch above anything you've seen in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or Street Fighter III. Who needs fancy 3D backdrops anyway?  Another stand out feature has to be the dual soundtracks, which are a combination of remixed favorites and heavy-bassed newbies. From the first Geese Howard tune (my personal favorite) to the remixed rendition of Ryu's classic stage theme, the complicated songs are airtight. My only real complaint in this area would have to be the removal of lyrics from the Final Fight stage anthem that could be found in the Japanese version. While I can understand the removal partially because of the inclusion of a few parent-unfriendly F-Words, I can't understand why it warranted the banishment of all the lyrics completely. Couldn't they have changed it instead of destroy it? Nitpick aside, it's a very involving score.  The real star of the show however (and the aspect that will keep them coming back in droves) is the excellent gameplay. A throwback to the days of yore, before the days of air juggles and 200-Hit combos, the fighting system is an effective mix of both companies' distinctive fighting engines. Eliminating the two strongest kick and punch buttons from Capcom's usual six-button layout, the mechanics are similar to the King of Fighters series. While the collision system and overall physics of the game lends itself more clearly to the Street Fighter breed. Whatever it is that you want to call this amalgamatory hybrid, I'm in love with it nonetheless.  Since veterans of both franchises have preferences on how they would like their super moves to be charged, you can choose between the styles of play you would most prefer to fight with. Be it ~Capcom Groove~ or ~SNK Groove~, experts from both series will be able to choose the right settings just for them. (Though I expect most will select the ~SNK Groove~ as it allows unlimited charging of the power bar, as opposed to waiting for it to gain size via blocks and special moves). Needless to say, once you've unlocked the EX versions of characters and the alternating run mode in the options screen, there's a real level of customization to be had in Millennium Fight 2000.  What I like best about the fighting system though, is how characters are broken up into different ratios. Assigned a power rating of one to four, choosing the right fighters for an oncoming battle can be key to victory. Is nabbing four Ratio 1 characters the way to go, or should you select two Ratio 2 scrappers? What if I go with one Ratio 3 guy and another Ratio 1 fighter, or just throw caution to the wind and select an all-powerful Ratio 4 monster? However it is that you choose your four ratio slots, one thing is for certain; It will make the game more than interesting.  Admittedly, there are some characters that appear to have been moved to the wrong ratio and could have been placed elsewhere. As anyone who thinks that Benimaru and Blanka are useless scrubs are in for one mother of a surprise. Furthermore, the idea that Yamazaki is powerful enough to warrant a Ratio 3 standing or the fact that Evil Ryu has a lofty Ratio 4 designation is definitely a bit absurd. Discrepancies in position aside, the game itself is still a hell of a lot of fun.  And fun is really what matters when it's all said and done. The target of some scrutiny by many a member of both arcadeophiles and press junkies, Capcom vs. SNK shouldn't be measured by what isn't... but instead, by what it is. A slightly flawed, if not terrific fusion of some of the best fighting games to ever grace our consoles, Capcom vs. SNK stands tall as one of the single greatest Dreamcast games ever released. And with the recent announcement of a sequel to this masterpiece in the works at this very moment, you can bet that we haven't seen anything yet!", "date": "Nov 13, 2000"}
