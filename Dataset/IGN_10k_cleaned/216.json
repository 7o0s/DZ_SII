The anticipation of the green light releasing him into a blur of landscapes causes him to reflect on his lifelong dream of being a world class race car driver.  He raced carts as child, and now has his chance behind the wheel of a multi-million-dollar dream machine.  As the race ignites, he takes off in the pack ready to endure several hours of racing for the checkered flag, and one can only wonder if he simply still isn't the same little boy inside from years ago.  Busting through the starting line with a very nice offering, in the racing genre, comes UBI Soft's Monaco Grand Prix.  This game is a Formula 1 racing title with (almost) all the trimmings.  As mentioned in our earlier preview of the same title, new to this version is the addition of an FMV introduction, checkpoints (a standard in US release racing titles) and the use of the classic cars form the games Retro Mode upon more current raceways.  These changes made, Monaco GP stands out as a strong title in a popular category, rounding out the Dreamcast launch line-up quite nicely.  One thing Monaco does manage to bring to the table is a plethora of options.  As I mentioned there is a Retro Mode that offers racing classic 1950's speedsters.  In addition to that, there are five modes including Single Race, Championship, Career, Time Attack, and a Dual Split Screen mode.  UBI serves up 11 racing teams, comprised of 22 drivers on 16 tracks.  The arcade mode makes things a whole helluva lot easier, and to some more fun but the game is at its programmer's best when you try it out as a simulation.   Of course, racing in the Simulation Mode would certainly benefit from the aid of an analog wheel.  Not to imply that the Dreamcast controller is not adequate, as for some it may be.  But the additional range of motion offered by an analog racing wheel is very crucial to getting the most out of the various car handling characteristics playing Monaco GP as a simulation.  The controller defaults are configurable, so you don't have to be stuck with something you don't like in terms of layout.  You can even use the D-Pad to steer if you so want.  This can be critical when traveling at insane speeds.  Everything else becomes critical too, from knowing when to pit and what to do (in terms of taking on fuel, tire changes, spoiler adjustments etc.) once there.  If you don't think this game is tight, factor in that prior to hitting the tarmac, you can actually determine your fuel fill level, the car's body height and gear ratios-to name only a few.  From an environmental standpoint, the tracks are well designed and seem to be a fair representation of real F1 tracks.  The process of environmental mapping, to simulate accurate reflections is used very sparingly, as the cars do not have an abundance of glass to show off such a trait.  The weather plays a significant role, so be prepared to load-out your hotrod with set of rain slicks when Mother Nature dictates.  But perhaps the most important aspect of the game is its sense of speed. Monaco GP is simply exhilarating, and the fact that there is no pop-up is nothing short of astounding!  The vehicles in this game pound out some horses, and in doing so tear shred some serious rubber in the process.  You can actually reach speeds in excess of 195mph!  The frame rate in this game never seems to bog down no matter how many cars are on-screen at one time, and the frame rate has to be above 30 fps or my name isn't ~Rico Suave.~  Well...my name's not Rico Suave, but that frame rate is kickin'!   And what better way to check it out than with the game's excellent camera system?  It's replete with all requisite views; in-car (with dash), nose cam, three-quarter overhead, chase and so on.  Several of these are actually playable, even the in-car views, depending on how well you are at memorizing landmarks as reference points for breaking.  You will get the best sense of speed form the nose or in-car cameras, so learning this discipline is important to getting the most sensation out of Monaco GP.  I would be remiss not to mention the manner in which the Jump Pack (Puru Puru in Japan) handles controller feedback.  Each shift of the gearbox causes the Jump Pack to nudge the controller in your hand; much like the way an engine shifts on its mounts when you tap the accelerator.  It actually feels like it is rocking forward. The Jump Pack also comes to life during encounters with grass, fences, spinouts and (of course) other cars.  Feedback is nicely implemented, and well worth the cost of the device.    Speaking of feedback from contact with other cars, Monaco GP's computer controlled vehicles exhibit many different racing characteristics.  While several games boast this feature, few have done it so well as this.  Some drivers are very non-resistant to aggressive moves by others, while some are downright mean. You don't get mindless zig-zagging AI here.  What you get is calculated, thought provoking cunning and trickery.  You'll have to play to really see what I mean, but let me just sya that it is pretty damned impressive.  The in-game sounds consist of pneumatic tools in use, techno music and what I refer to as the ~typically annoying buzz of F1 engines.~  Fortunately, the cars don't sound as bad as some I have had to endure-so I won't go off on a rant about the Flight of the BumbleBees.  In the end, Monaco Grand Prix is a very solid title.  Racing fans will find much to like about the game, from the lack of draw-in, as this often hampers relatively good racing efforts, to the sense of speed that the solid frame-rate conveys.  Purist will miss the fact there is no official licenses associated with this title, though anyone wanting a terrific racing experience should not miss this one by any means.  Fabian Blache III, Contributor Monaco Grand Prix took me by surprise. Early versions of the game I was able to play were promising, but framerates were so dismal that I wasn't exactly confident that Ubi could tweak the game to run at passable speeds. Well, the programmers pulled it off and put together a great Formula 1 sim that's easily the best on the console when it comes to handling and gameplay. The control is excellent and enables you to drive just like the pros.If there is one complaint I want to lodge against Monaco GP, it's that it doesn't exactly try to beat its competition by offering something new. The career mode is great, but a game that appeals to a specialized audience yet lacks the official licenses should offer a little more than just the usual lineup of modes. It would have been nice to for once see a four-player mode, a two-player championship mode, an in-depth story mode, or  if the N64's hardware limitations are simply too much to overcome  at least some extra goodies like a decal designer, a classic race mode (like the one found in the Dreamcast version of MGP), or perhaps the newly built Indianapolis track. And where is the Kuala Lumpur track that's part of the '99 F1 Championship? What N64 owners get instead is a bare bones, albeit exquisite F1 racing sim with a great career mode and outstanding control. With Ubi Soft and Video System now collaborating on a new F1 game for the next season, it will be interesting to see if the two companies can combine the attention to detail and wealth of features of F-1 WGP with the excellent handling of MGP to create the perfect F1 sim. Until then, Monaco Grand Prix remains the leader of the pack.", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
