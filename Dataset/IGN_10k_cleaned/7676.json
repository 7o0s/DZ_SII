Last year was a lousy year to be a PlayStation owner and a baseball fan  lets face it, all the baseball titles sucked in 1998. Whatever happened, 989 Studios picked itself up, dusted itself off, and went back to work. And what we have here is another incredible baseball game.   MLB 2000's obvious inspiration is Sega Saturn's own World Series Baseball '98. This game was arguably the tops of the current 3D baseball lot. Just look at many of the control interfaces and tiny nuances and you'll see the similarities. Gameplay  989 Studios makes a big deal every year about ~Total Control~ this, ~Total Control~ that. Last year it was Total Control Pitching, which was just a fancy word for its own specific pitching interface. This year, they coined the phrase Total Control Batting. What this means is simple  you're given the option to choose one of four areas of the strike zone ahead of time, guessing where the pitcher will throw the ball. Normally you have to move the batter cursor around the box to follow the ball as it's being thrown, but if you guess correctly, the cursor ~locks on~ to where the ball will end up  and it's just up to you to time the swing. The downside to this batting interface: you cannot check swing. Once you tap that button, it's a full swing around.  Fielding is as easy as it comes  once it's in the field, it's all a matter of tapping the button that corresponds to the base position. You know, O throws to first, Triangle to Second, Square to third...  The game also features the expected trade, free-agent, season, and create-a-player modes, which totally become useful for statistic freaks who must keep their line-ups as current as possible. Nowadays, a baseball game isn't a baseball game unless it has these features, and rest assured 989 Studios knows this.  But if there must be a complaint, it's in some of the corner cutting. 989 Studios wants to have the most complete baseball game, yet some of the little nuances are missing  things like players running off and on the field, or stepping out of the batters box. And don't get me started on the incredibly anti-climactic home run sequence. In terms of energy, Triple Play 2000 has this game beat.  And along the same comparison lines to Triple Play 2000, our biggest complaint of that game is in this game too: you cannot select a match-up based on the team abilities. Why the heck are baseball designers leaving this key feature out? Graphics  The graphics are definitely MLB 2000's high-point  the game features a 30 FPS 3D engine with extremely vibrant textures. All the stadiums look just like their real-life counterparts, minus a few minute details due to licensing issues.  There are some clipping and collision detection problems around the perimeter of the stadiums where players will disappear halfway into walls in a foul-ball dive.   Player animations are incredibly detailed, thanks to elaborate motion capturing. Just wait until you see a player step up to the plate, or an outfielder pump back to throw all the way to home and you can see how accurate the designers wanted to be with player animations.  Sound Commentary is provided by Vin Scully and Dave Campbell, and while it is certainly competent play-by-play, there's really no life in the voice, and the two announcers don't click well when they ~talk to each other.~ Obviously EA Sports has the upperhand when it comes to color commentary  but don't count out 989 Studios when they grab their guys for next year's recording session. Stadium noises are of standard fare, but for some odd reason 989 Studios insists on overusing the ~We Will Rock You~ thump-thump-clap chant about three times an inning. It's obnoxious. Damn obnoxious. MLB 2000 is a fantastic baseball game that has the unfortunate task of convincing you that it's the baseball title to have this year instead of the other hitters on the shelf. This year, it's just as hard to pick a winner in the baseball competition as last year. In 1998 it was tough to find one that was any good. This year, it's tough to find a bad one. Both Triple Play 2000 and MLB 2000 are winners in my book, but alas, you want to know which one's the best. Well, I'll let you have it.MLB 2000's graphics are a little more vibrant, and controls are a little tighter than Triple Play 2000. But, Triple Play 2000 feels more complete and it has more energy. You can't go wrong with either game, but my money goes to Triple Play 2000 this year.", "date": "Apr 7, 1999"}
