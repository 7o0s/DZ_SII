Drop a cute, cuddly teddy bear of a hero into a colorful landscape filled with gameplay-extending collectibles and then have that character set on a quest to save -- what else? -- a princess. To make matters worse, platformers specifically designed for younger players have sometimes been dumbed down, providing fewer clever puzzles and challenge in favor of more collectibles, a disappointing truth.But thankfully this is not the case with the THQ-published sequel Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams. The title, smartly developed by Avalanche, is carefully designed so that both younger and older players can enjoy it for different reasons. The kids growing up on other popular Nickelodeon tie-ins will naturally be drawn to the aforementioned cute main character and colorful landscapes while adults will appreciate the way the game goes out of its way to make fun of platformer  clichs through well-scripted, often humorous dialogue, and that it doesn't skimp on challenge. Indeed, some of the environmental-based puzzles Tak 2 delivers are surprisingly engaging.Tak is in a different league than Ty, in other words. And yet, a couple of the unfortunate technical drawbacks that have lingered over the platformer genre for years have in this sequel invaded the land of the Pupunanu people, which keeps Tak 2 from a slightly higher score.Nightmares and DreamscapesTak 2 takes place in and out of the Dream World, a new set of levels filled with intentionally warped, stylized landscapes and gruesome monster enemies. It's in the first area of the Dream World, overrun with surreal floating, sludgy platforms, that Tak encounters a guiding voice who explains what must be done. A princess has been kidnapped and unless Tak can save her, all will be lost. The would-be hero takes only a moment to ponder the proposition before turning it down in a well-acted dialogue that's sure to invite smiles. However, after the voice tells Tak that he will forever be stuck in the Dream World unless he embarks upon the quest, the character agrees to start off and the game begins. Click For More Images What follows is every bit the sequel and Tak 2 is what a sequel should be: a bigger, better version of the original. This is a larger, funnier, prettier game complemented by a host of new character moves, new gameplay types, and unlockable extras. Players will be able to indirectly manipulate some animals, a franchise staple, but they'll also be able to morph into and control some of them for humorous results. Tak can even harness the benefits of Juju magic for in-battle results.The gameplay dynamics in Tak 2 have for the most part not changed from the first title, which is acceptable given that they worked from the beginning. Tak still controls precisely with the analog stick and can be made to perform a host of valuable moves from jumping to swinging on vines and zip lines, striking with his Thwark, using his boomerang like Bolas, and dealing out powerful combos that can easily demolish groups of foes. As Tak acquires more Juju magic, he can enhance his move set, adding more power to blows, or injecting more speed into his run in short, but effective bursts. The enhancements in turn tie satisfyingly into the make up of levels. For instance, Tak might not be able to clear a chasm with his standard double jump ability, but the extra length gained by a preceding speed burst is just enough to get the job done.   Tak 2 eclipses its predecessor in sheer variety. There are standard platformer levels, yes. But the game also dishes out a wide variety of new level types, which in turn require new gameplay devices and controls. Tak will need to race down a roaring river in a barrel, dodging fallen trees and fending off enemies. And he'll speed a tank-like off-roader through the Dream World, all the while catching huge jumps over gaps in craters and navigating thing roadways to the end. Both are completely fun and entertaining additions to the franchise, and they represent only a portion of the extras that await players. Halfway through the game Tak gains the ability to transform into animals like the bear, boar and frog, which enable gamers' welcomed new play scenarios.Unfortunately, while Tak 2's play types have been expanded, the sequel's camera system has not seen dramatic improvements. Indeed, despite a fully maneuverable camera mapped to the second analog stick, there are points in levels where players will simply not be given a full view of their situation. Sometimes the camera collides with walls and refuses to go full circle. Other times it moves in an unexplainably jittery pattern whether there are obstacles in its way or not. Thankfully, neither happens commonly, only occasionally -- but that doesn't diminish the level of frustration players are bound to feel every so often.If the title sometimes lacks in camera robustness, it excels at delivering players a true, engaging sense of challenge. Some of the puzzles in Tak 2 are downright clever. Players will only be able to advance in some cases if they take into account both the environments and the animals that inhabit them. For example, early on Tak needs to gain access beyond a fallen group or boulders. Click For More Images To do that, players must trick a skunk into spraying Tak with its smell, chase a grossed-out bear to a nearby platform and finally coax the animal into hurling Tak across a valley to the point just beyond the boulders. Later in the game, gamers will need to devise methods of transporting explosive barrels through walkways littered by weight-activated dart guns. It's not always easy, but it is fun. And still later, Tak must use a machine that shoots blaster rays to clear a computerized runway of obstacles so that electricity can flow through. It took us several tries to figure out the correct way to get the job done, in some cases, but having finally completed the task we felt a strong sense of accomplishment.There are some trial and error moments, which are disappointing. Some obstacles can probably not be beaten without first going through a ~die and retry~ scenario, but these are mercifully few and far between.Meanwhile, gamers will appreciate the fact that Tak 2 doesn't end after a few hours. Players will be able to get a good 15 hours out of the game, if not more, which is a rarity for a title that could be labeled ~a kid's game.~ The huge, totally varied worlds in Tak 2 are brought to life thanks to a strong 3D engine that can usually spit out detailed environments with little slowdown, and very stylized, creative artwork. Many of the levels in the game, backboned by gorgeous painted backdrops, look extremely reminiscent of the stages in the Rayman games, a series respected around the globe for its graphic presentation. Between beautifully animated cut-scenes complete with flawless facial and body animation, vivid character models that look every bit as good up close as they do from a distance, a lighting engine that easily and realistically illuminates darkened caves with shimmering fire, and a particle system that believably realizes everything from huge explosions to magic spells, Tak 2 is a very pretty platformer.    The game never runs at 60 frames per second and indeed there are points where the fluidity stutters, especially in areas with high amounts of particles -- like, for instance, a roaring river with a waterfall. And there is the occasional clipping issue. But for the most part Tak 2 looks better than most platformers on the market.The graphics and audio come together for a presentation that's surprisingly amusing. Crisp, solidly voiced dialogue brings life to the spastic, animated characters in the game. THQ has contracted celebrity actors like Patrick Warburton (who played Puddy on Seinfeld) to voice some of the main characters in the game. While younger players will likely enjoy the characters themselves and their colorful interactions, the writing in the game features nuances and subtleties for adults to pick up on. There are lowbrow and highbrow jokes ranging from smelly armpit humor to a main enemy character that unwittingly reveals his identity to players by accidentally talking like a goat. Meanwhile, each of the Juju gods that Tak encounters is hilarious for different reasons. One of them in particular reminds us of the character Master-Blaster from the Mad Max series, except that the Juju god's ~master~ is a talking, sweet-craving stomach and its ~blaster~ a brain-dead head and body.To top everything off, Tak 2 features a collection extra that rewards players for finding all of the hidden secrets. Collecting the hidden goodies is by no means mandatory, but gamers who do will unlock extras such as concept art and gameplay-extending mini-games that can be enjoyed long after the single-player quest comes to an end. Click For More Images Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams is a great sequel to what was a fun, well-designed platformer. The sequel rules apply here: this is a bigger and prettier game. But on top of that, Tak 2Tak 2's intuitive control mechanics and colorful characters while adults will -- as we did -- be able to appreciate the underlying humor and the clever puzzles that lie in wait.That's not to say there isn't any room for improvement though. To be sure, the game's camera system -- occasionally disobedient, to say the least -- could use some work. The framerate sometimes stutters. And there are some trial and error gameplay moments, which always manage to frustrate.Still, Tak 2 remains a fun, beautiful platformer that both Nickelodeon and THQ can be proud of.", "date": "Oct 12, 2004"}
