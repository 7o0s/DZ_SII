It's a racer that promised to bring larger-than-life freestyle moves to a somewhat faithful representation of the sport of supercross and motocross. In the end, it's a mildly entertaining package that seems more suited for the pick-up-and-play audience. This is a good thing for those that may have found MX Superfly and Freekstyle too demanding in the area of control mechanics, but for a drawback to those that enjoyed the previously released GameCube racers.   Features Three gameplay styles include Freestyle, Motocross, and Supercross Enter the Challenge mode to conquer specific goals Entertaining physics model lets gamers pull off huge air with great forgiveness Tour six different Freestyle arenas and 20 different tracks Pull off over 30 wicked tricks as you catch monster airtime Supercross and Motocross circuits pit you in races with 12 riders on-screen at the same time -- all fighting for first place Intuitive controls allow anybody to pick-up a controller Challenge a friend in a head-to-head multiplayer mode   Gameplay Infogrames and Paradigm focused on Big Air Freestyle to make it more accessible than MXrider. The core gameplay offers up the same style of motocross and supercross racing, but does so without the FIM (Federation Internationale de Motocyclisme) license. As you might guess by the name, this gave it a distinct European flavor, which helped set it apart from some of the other racers out there. With Big Air Freestyle, this is all gone. The tracks and gameplay remains in tact, but some of the presentation is lost with this exclusion. Regardless of that detail, though, it's still a very straightforward package with several modes to choose from including Freestyle, Race, Challenge, and Multiplayer.     While the name implies Freestyle is the focus, that's not necessarily the case. Race, which pits you in a number of different motocross and supercross circuits, could be labled the deeper mode. You start with a small amount of cash and can enter into certain events. As you gain top spots in your races, you'll earn money and eventually be able to pursue more difficult circuits. It's pretty cut-and-dry, which leaves much of the gameplay variation divided up over the different courses. The style of the tracks vary to include dry dirt, mud, sand, and a number of other different surfaces. Naturally, you can modify (in a minor way) your vehicle's tires, suspension, and engine. For instance, changing to soft tires for a sandy track provides a great deal more grip and all around improved handling. You really do notice the difference, so it's worth it to tinker around with the setup. As a whole, the mode is entertaining, but the merciful control mechanics will prove tiresome eventually. Bikes feel very light and you feel disconnected with the track. There's just not a lot of weight to the bikes. In part, this seems the intention of Paradigm to give Big Air Freestyle a more accessible appeal. It will prove more intuitive for younger gamers, but older gamers that demand more would be better served to look elsewhere.     As for the Freestyle mode, it is completely different than the races. You take to wide-open arenas and perform totally impossible trick sets. There are a huge amount of stunts, which are pretty easy to pull off if you catch enough air. To perform the high-flying tricks, all you have to do is hold the L-trigger and than tap the face buttons in conjuction with it. For example, L+A, A, Y, would generate a fairly wild trick. Much like racing, it's very intuitive. Backflips are as simple as holding L and then tapping down on the control stick. In concept, Freestyle mode doesn't seem too bad. However, the execution of it is flawed. Yes, it's very cool to jump through flaming hoops, or launch yourself over a giant fishtank that houses a shark. However, the whole process of racing around the tracks and pulling off stunts is very stiff and listless. You don't feel like you're ~performing~ stunts, so much as you do feel like you're ~activating~ them. As you tap through the button combinations, the stunts will take place as you watch. Of course this is how videogames work, but it just feels robotic with Big Air Freestyle.   For its whole package, Big Air Freestyle is a decent offering by Paradigm, but nothing we could recommend to buy. Experienced gamers will find its shallow controls and rigid mechanics lackluster, and ultimately unlikable regarding the Freestyle mode. The race circuits are passable and amusing for a bit, but will most definitely wear off in appeal. For gamers looking for something very easy to get into, Big Air Freestyle is quite playable. Thanks to its intuitive and forgiving nature, it's especially recommended for any younger gamer who wants is into supercross or motocross scene.  Graphics Being a PlayStation 2 port that has been adjusted to GameCube, Big Air Freestyle is nothing spectacular. The character and bike models are nicely done, and blend nicely with the tracks as multi-texturing kicks in; dirt and mud will accumulate on riders as the laps go by. You'll see other subtle touches such as reflections off of puddles as well as track indents from weight of your bike. Lighting is pretty basic, but a nice shadow is cast from your player thanks to the sourcing.  One of the bigger improvements since the title evolved from MXrider is that it runs at 60 frames per second. It's not perfect, but it's above average and gives you a much better sense of speed. The camera is even pulled down towards the ground to heighten this sensation.   Overall, Big Air Freestyle's visuals are a little harsh, but the speedy framerate and extra touches such as reflections and dirt accumulation round them out.   Sound While sound effects can be churned out in mono, stereo, surround, and even headphones, indicating they were a focus during design, the end result doesn't quite reflect that. Audio effects are rudimentary. The buzzing of the bikes, spinning tires, and collisions are all rudimentary. The bigger aural sensation comes form the nicely matched soundtrack, which includes tracks from bands such as 311 and Sugarcult. There's a nice mix of punk to be found, and if it's your type of music, it can squeeze a few more ounces of adrenaline out of you as you race for first. There have been a lot of motocross/supercross, dirtbike racers on GameCube at this point; I've had my fill of MX Superfly, Freekstyle, and Jeremy McGrath. Unfortunately, for me, Big Air Freestyle brings nothing new to the table. The Race mode was certainly my favorite because I could fight against a crew of about 11 other bikers, but because of the simple control mechanics I lost interest quickly. That's why I recommend Big Air Freestyle to the less demanding and younger gamers. It is very easy to jump into, has a solid presentation -- making navigation easy -- and even a multiplayer mode if you have a friend over.", "date": "Oct 2, 2002"}
