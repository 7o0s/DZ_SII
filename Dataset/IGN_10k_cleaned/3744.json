Right now, World Cup Soccer '98 contends as one of the best soccer games on PlayStation, plugging the holes that Road to World Cup couldn't fill.  Without mincing words, I'll get straight to the point, World Cup features a bucketload of moves, an excellent sense of control, great options such as In-Game Management and Strategy, and music and sound that tops any soccer game. And yet, with all of these positive aspects going for it, we're perplexed that the frame rate is still so slow, and the load times are slower than snails on crank.  But let's get into the meat of the game, shall we? Bursting into your stereo (which you should have hooked up to your PlayStation for full sound immersion) each time you load World Cup Soccer '98 is Chumba Wumba's Thub Thumping. While that song may get old after about .5 seconds, its gets you in the mood -- it's rowdy, easily singable, and well, thumpin'. Along with this popular band is a good mix of quick, high-hat heavy techno that fills the air as you scan the menu bars.   What's also great about the CD format is that the announcer reads off the names of each player when the action is focused on him. Make sure to brag about this to your friends because this just doesn't happen in the Nintendo 64 -- the voices just won't fit on the lowly cartridge.  The game has moves and more than just bucketloads. It's got blimps full. The manual spots five pages for just moves! The best moves, at least in my opinion, are the Through Passes and First Time Through passes. These enable players to receive, instantly locate and pass off the ball to the next closest player. What you get is a ball that moves rapidly up the field, usually stunning your winded opponent. The goal free kicks are also spot-on. you can aim and bend or curve you passes up down, left or right. This is really sweetness -- and moves the game up to far more realistic standards.    The ascending difficulty levels are quite nice too, and although this seems like a given (as almost all games feature different difficulty levels), World Cup '98 gets all clever-tricky on you. Defensive players read your accurate passes and intercept them often; penetrating the defensive line takes more strategy and instant skill than just plowing power and luck, and you will get scored on more than you like. In short, once finished with the easy and medium levels, give the harder levels a try.  As for the innovation, World Cup '98 keeps itself afloat by incorporating the elements that were so crucial in Konami's Nintendo 64 game, International Superstar Soccer. Dubbed IGM (in-game management), the 'new' feature permits mid-play formation and strategy reformation. Getting whooped? Hit Select and move your players back 10 yards or so, or drop from a 4-2-4 to a 4-4-2, and then switch back later when you need to. As always, EA is the king of the million option features. Almost everything can be retooled, fixed, altered, or modified. Cool team management options that should be noted are positioning, kick takers, attacking bias, aggression, and man marking (for players like Edmondo the Animal, perhaps?).  So, when aren't I giving this game a perfect score? EA, as previously stated, just doesn't create the newest, most creative aspects to games anymore: it's become conservative and slow as it's become humongous. ISS64 paved the way for the next wave of soccer games to follow, and EA has done just that. Granted, World Cup Soccer is a great game, but it's not the first in its innovations.  Graphically, the game reaches near top notch status, and serves as an example of the 8 score. The characters yield a slew of move animations unsurpassed in prior EA soccer games, so when you fake left, dribble right, and then pass the ball through your opponents legs, the animation sequences follow the moves you performed.   The ball physics are also better now, too. While physics normally shouldn't be a graphics item, it's significant here. In previous EA soccer games, the ball looked like a crumpled lump of newspaper, while in World Cup '98 it appears and moves like a soccer ball, rolling down the field quite well, bouncing off heads, and spinning like it should on grass.  Finally, the game's frame rate is unfortunately not that great. It's not bad, it's borderline. Most people won't notice the little flickering sight of frames loading, but I did. The frame rate is equivalent to a bird in flight minus one third of its flaps -- you notice it, but you put up with it. (That poor bird!)  In any case, World Cup Soccer is a blast. It's a big game, full of little details, such as trivia games, real players, great strategy, and a deep, gritty feeling for the game.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Jul 16, 1998"}
