With Sega's popular NBA 2K series making the jump to all three next generation consoles last season, NBA Live 2003 pretty much had to do something great to keep EA in the game. This latest version of NBA Live succeeds because it allows gamers to focus on the most exciting and entertaining parts of NBA basketball but with all of the rules and realism you'd expect from an all out NBA simulation. Plus the new ~freestyle control~ system on the C-stick could actually be the gaming revolution that EA's marketing types have been hyping up so much.    FeaturesRebound logic has been tweaked to act more realisticly More motion captures than ever before, where multiple players were captured simultaneously Individual passing styles -- player specific pass animations dependent on skills and attributes Enhanced lighting, real NBA coaches, and dramatic camera coverage brings you closer to the game Classic jerseys from your favorite teams' glory days Situational controller vibration alerts you for important in-game moments, such as a winding down shot clock   Gameplay The most interesting aspect of NBA Live 2003 is that it somehow brings blatant arcade and simulation elements together to coexist peacefully in one game. Nine times out of ten schizophrenic sports games that try to force-feed wild over-the-top antics into an obvious basketball sim with rules and dimensions and everything end up pissing  off fans of either type of game. Live 2003's attention to NBA details, rules and style of play is completely legitimate, yet gamers are given the freedom to repeatedly create exciting highlight-worthy plays that would keep the crowds cheering and coaches stressed out. The arcade fun comes from the exaggerated speed of the game and the dozens of new moves you can pull of with players using the right analog stick. But the satisfaction comes from knowing that even when you're throwing down impossible reverse alley oops from behind the backboard you know you're still within the rules and conventions of the NBA.  Freestyle control is revolutionary in that it allows the player with the ball to pull off a variety of offensive moves in the blink of an eye and that you determine the direction and variation of the move. And when we say dozens of moves, we're talking about four versions of the crossover, three kinds of spin moves and all kinds of hesitation dribbles that can be performed with either hand. Furthermore, you have different moves available depending on the situation. Moving with the ball, in the triple threat position or with his back to the basket are the three main situations your player will be in, but then again you can quickly go from one to the other and string moves together. Quickly tapping up on the right analog stick when your player is moving will make him pull off a quick spin move but it's not the same spin move you get when you hold the right stick up. That spin move causes him to plant, set up the defender and whirl all the way around 360 degrees so that he's traveling in the same direction when he comes out of it. And neither one of those is like the spin move where the ball stays in the same hand but the player himself whirls around in a circle like one of those moves from the Nike Freestyle commercials. You pull that one off by moving the right analog in a semicircle from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock on the left side if the ball is in his left hand, on the right side if it's in his right. And it only gets deeper from there.  We could spend this entire review going over the moves and situations available to you in Freestyle control, but we won't. Let's just say you'll still be discovering new moves weeks after you've initially picked up the game. Try all of the quarter circles and half circle moves you remember from Street Fighter in a variety of different situations and then start doing them from south to north instead of east to west. The creativity shown by the developer's at EA Canada is reflected in the fact that many moves are intuitive and reflect of how you'd move a basketball with your hands in real life. And we haven't even told you about how the right analog stick is used on defense to swipe with your left or right hand, crouch down into defensive position and to passively stretch your player's hands up to avoid the foul on a shot.   When it comes to gameplay, you'd think the freestyle controls would give you an extremely unfair advantage against the CPU. But that's where Live 2003's other enhancements kick in because you've got to use some serious basketball sense against your opponent in this game, especially when you're playing against humans. First, it's important that experienced NBA gamers use the top two difficulty settings right from the beginning because the lower two are pretty much a joke and intended for novices to familiarize themselves with the game's new control style. On All-Star and Superstar difficulties you will acknowledge truisms of NBA basketball like ~defense wins championships,~ ~let the offense come to you~ and ~don't force it~ because failure to do so will mean plenty of losses.   CPU controlled players, whether there's a human controlling their teammates or not will push the ball on the fast break after a bad shot or a turnover like the 1990 UNLV Runnin' Rebels. That is, putting up a quick three pointer or forcing a shot before your offense has a chance to set up will lead to tons of fast break opportunities at other end for your opponent. In their efforts to re-create that realism, however, the developers may have overcompensated a bit because the CPU can create opportunities for itself on fast breaks that even the best human players won't be able to match. Somehow players on your team never show the burst of speed and intelligence that CPU players exhibit all the time on the fast break. The only way to combat this is to play solid offense and prevent fast break opportunities from even happening, which is always makes good coaching sense.  Those freestyle controls are only valuable when the ball is in the hands of somebody like Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant because they've got handles that Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal, as great as they are, do not. Likewise an adept defender like Ben Wallace or Aaron McKie will have no problem containing whatever spin move, crossover or hesitation dribble you can come up with if you insist on letting one player hog the ball. The game compels you to work the ball, at least a little, in the offensive scheme you call so that by the time you do get the ball to Vince Carter, for example, he'll only need one move or two to get a good scoring opportunity because the defense will be out of position or maybe even mismatched.  The D-pad has four default plays on offense and four default on defense that reflect how NBA basketball is really played in the 21st century. Acknowledging that few teams actually run Motion ISO High or any other play from the 1950s, you're given four sets on offense: Isolation, 3 Point, Post Up and Pick and Roll. None of them requires much thought, just the ability to recognize openings when they happen. Calling the 3 Point play doesn't make the treys automatic it just means that your perimeter players will stand behind the arc, as opposed to another open spot, when the defense double teams the player with the ball in the low post. You still have to make the magic happen. The defensive schemes are no more complicated than : man to man, 2-3 zone defense, full court press and half court trap. NBA defenses don't get more complicated than that.      The end result is that you'll be scoring on a totally unrealistic number of dunks and wide open jump shots -- we're talking 65%-80% shooting percentages for a game -- but it will look and sound like a real NBA game with uniforms and rules and all that. Playing effective defense is the real challenge you're after in NBA Live since blocking dunks, taking charges -- another new innovation, it has its own button -- and otherwise shutting down another team are extremely difficult. Again, though the best counter to a strong offense is an even stronger offense of your own. And it's true, even among basketball videogame competitors (Live and 2K3) that defense wins championships but offense puts the butts in the seats.  Live's franchise, 1-on-1, playoffs and other modes are all functional (unlike some of NBA 2K3's auxiliary game modes) and more or less give you extra ways to enjoy the game's mix of contained offensive chaos. The tutorial featuring Marv Albert's only appearance in the game -- he'll do play by play next year -- makes for a nice commercial but only scratches the surface in teaching you how to pull off some of the new moves in the game.   Graphics Live is silky smooth during gameplay but inexplicably chops up during the tons of cut scenes forced on you during a game. Plus the developers made a poor choice for the default camera setting. By all means, switch to one of the baseline cameras to get the proper feel for the game, because the default sideline camera is too close for comfort. Let's face it, playing sports games like football, hockey and baseball from a top-down, north-south perspective has become the standard. Leave the side-to-side stuff to soccer.  Live's personality is consistent in its cut scenes as well so that you get the idea that this game is serious, but only to the extent that it's necessary. Otherwise, it's all about the fun of players playing little practical jokes on teammates, the referees and coaches during cut scenes that pop up after every dead ball. They quickly repeat themselves so thankfully you can tone down how often they come up.   The models in Live are effective but still very blocky considering how far we've come in sports games. If any sport can have super detailed player models it should be basketball with only ten guys on a 94 foot court. You wouldn't recognize these players out of uniform if it weren't for some of their distinctive tattoos and hairstyles.   The animation is one of the strongest points of the game and the new control scheme is a big reason for that. There are multiple versions of the behind-the-back dribble and they're all lightning quick, but the animation in Live 2003 is clean enough to tell the difference between each move.  Similarly, the variation on dunks is outstanding considering how often you're going to be throwing 'em down in this game.   Sound It will only be a matter of time before Electronic Arts starts its own record label. It was late in the days of the N64 and PlayStation that they promoted a rising artist named ~O~ for the Knockout King franchise, but now NBA Live 2003 features original tracks and fresh new singles from artist like Angie Martinez, Snoop Dogg and Fabolous. Some of the performers -- we won't tell you who just yet -- are even unlockable players in the game. The tracks are playing in order pretty much any time you're not actually in an NBA arena playing a gamewith the clock running. Unlike Madden 2003, though, you can skip to the next song while you're in the main menu. For those of you who want these fresh tunes in your ride and you haven't installed your favorite game system into the headrest of your Oldsmobile Cutlass just yet, the bonus CD that comes packed in with NBA Live features the original tunes composed for the game.   The announcing is surprisingly good with free throw king and former Houston Rocket Calvin Murphy doing and excellent job on the color commentary. Marv Albert would've been better but the play-by-play placeholder they got for this year's game is decent.  The arena sound effects are outstanding with player chatter, crowd reaction and coach barking all adding plenty of authenticity. You can hear players talking trash, calling out plays and offering warning that really make sense in the context of the game. One of your guys may call out ~Let's dig in!~ late in a tight game. Or the home crowd will boo or stay silent if their team isn't putting up a good fight or losing by a huge margin. The best part is when they react to a particularly dazzling move like a stutter step crossover. They all go ~Oooooooh!~ as a defender gets his ankles broken and it sounds a lot different than ~Boooooo!~ when it's their defense giving up the points.I had plenty of fun playing NBA Live 2003, but you're not going to get the same depth that you expect from other EA Sports games. The Franchise mode is complete, but a good player will be able to win no matter what his roster looks like. And the thing is, the Freestyle control will make everybody a good NBA Live player sooner rather than later. The Freestyle system will at least be a revolution in EA's universe with NHL 2003 and FIFA 2003 both incorporating the new scheme and it's a welcome dose of freshness to the genre. Don't be surprised when Madden 2004 has stiff arms, hurdle and spin moves on the right analog stick next year either.The emphasis in this game is on scoring and creating spectacular plays, a job that once belonged to the NBA Jam/Showtime series. People enjoy watching Live 2003 as much as they enjoyed playing it. It's easy to pick up and play, making it very well suited for hours of head to head matches, the cornerstone of any sports game's value. With all of the highlight-worthy moves and action you can pull off, bragging rights for the best shake-and-bake dunk sequences will be on the line. With NBA 2K3's emphasis on creating the ultimate simulation, there's room for Sega's and EA's game in the same library since you're getting two entirely different approaches to the NBA.", "date": "Oct 8, 2002"}
