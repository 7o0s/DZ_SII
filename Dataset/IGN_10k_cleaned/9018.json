Konami now brings Pirate Poppers to mobile, but the transition has not exactly been kind. Pirate Poppers was already not much more than a clone of the Zuma/Luxor formula with pirate trimmings, but now it's been slowed down and most of its personality is still somewhere in the bitstream, waiting to land.   Across 60 stages, you control a cannon at the bottom of the screen, blasting colorful balls into a snaking line of cannonballs. Matching three or more cannonballs pops the like-colored group and the line responds in kind. If you remove a mid-section, the line does not advance until the back half catches up to the front. Seriously, you've played this game before many, many times -- the only marked difference between the Pirate Poppers and previous entries is the use of pirate and seafaring stuff.   When you clear out sections of the or pop special balls, tokens drop to the bottom of the screen. Catching them up offers temporary powers or affects the line of cannonballs. The spyglass grants you precision aim, showing you exactly where the ball will land in the line. A slowdown power-up is now called ~stern winds~ -- but the game is almost slow enough as it is.   The mobile Pirate Poppers seems even more derivative than the PC version because so much of the pirate theme has been lost. All you're left with in the mobile version is a screen decorated with some cannonball piles or a slight treasure island background. I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson w810i, which isn't a slouch of a game phone, so it's strange to see the muddied colors and unclear presentation.If you've played or are still playing Zuma or Luxor, there's no reason to download Pirate Poppers -- not even if you go to bed on Jack Sparrow sheets and bought a Blu-Ray player just to see the Black Pearl in high-def. The game is entirely derivative and the theme doesn't even come across very well on the smallest screen.", "date": "Sep 11, 2007"}
