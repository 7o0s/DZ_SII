As I loaded up Gameloft's 3D Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on an LG VX8000, it's obvious the bridge has been successfully built. Sam Fisher's latest adventure is essentially a port of the N-Gage game, released at the same time of the console games, but not on an MMC. This is a pure download (albeit, a heft one -- I had to disable several games to make room for it, a situation likely not helped by the presence of EA Mobile's Need for Speed 2 also in memory), and one that remarkably mimics the N-Gage game, save for some control issues that are less gameloft's fault than the antiquity of the thumbpad and number pad system of control.   Between the two abovementioned 3D games on V CAST, never has the need for an updated control mechanism on handsets been more necessary. Manufacturers can jam all the 3D chipsets into these handsets they want, but without better control, it almost doesn't mean a damn. In the case of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, players will indeed experience an unnecessary learning curve in their quest to control super-spy Sam. But that's not because of the need to memorize all of Sam's movements and gear, it's to get used to playing a 3D game on an old-skool sub-par D-pad.   Being a spy requires less-then-clumsy behaviors, but that's all I was able to eek out of Sam for a while. And that was long enough to get shot again and again, practically screaming in frustration at my handset. Moving side to side is not easy, as Sam tends to run in a curve. If you hold left for a while, Sam will actually jog in a complete circle. This would be great if he had a tail and needed to chase, but when I'm trying to avoid gunfire and instead of slipping behind a corner for cover I run in an arc too far out from the wall, I find myself starting to vibrate. In a bad way.   Many of Sam's movements and options are mapped to the number pad, such as using gadgets (the fiber optic cable, for example), jumping and interacting with obstacles and objects, as well as drawing your weapon. These are fine and make sense.   But this major complaint aside, I'm still agog at what's happening with cellphone games. This is a console-esque game on my handset, and that's a hell of a feat in such short time. The game comes complete with in-game cutscenes, facial textures, and decent sound effects. (I was hoping for music, though, but that's another handset limitation. Sound effects or music -- you gotta pick one or the other.)   This is a very full adventure for a mobile gamer looking for more than an ~I'll play for five minutes here and there~ game experience. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is something you can sit down and chew on for an hour or so, a great way to eat up a train ride or on an airplane with a flight attendant that understands what ~airplane mode~ is. The plot is a little reaching, but still quite good and decently told in the dialogue boxes. Gameloft hired a good writer for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory.   The visuals are certainly accomplished. Sam's model receives the most detail, complete with a face and uniform textures with greater resolution. Something the backdrops can get a little warped and ugly, reminding you of an old PSone game. The game's color palette is appropriately dark, which works for the mood, but forces you to hold the screen directly in line with your eyes if you want to see what's going on.  I've earned something of a rep for being more ~casual game~-oriented, which is valid as I enjoy games that are easy to slip into, devilishly addictive, and can be enjoyed by anybody I hand the phone to. The control scheme on today's phones are more conducive to ~one-button~ gaming. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is not an easy game for beginners to dive into. The controls are unforgiving and it requires a lot more time than many mobile gamers are accustomed to committing to a title. But the achievement is still there. I think the revolution is still coming, but games like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory are marching us there. The ball is somewhat in the manufacturers' court now -- update these controls, please. Then we'll be able to really take advantage of the 3D in a game like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory.", "date": "Jul 21, 2005"}
