{"name": "Guild Wars", "name_review": "Guild Wars", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/11/guild-wars", "text": "I've been following and playing MMO games for years now, and for the most part, they've essentially been the same type of game. Take a long time grinding, doing ~FedEx quests,~ and traveling; and dealing with server downtime and bugs. Guild Wars has slickly sidestepped most of these issues by being only partly an MMO. The cities and some far-flung locations act has hubs where players can socialize, trade, buy gear, sell loot, and gather up into parties, but everything outside of those relatively small zones is an instanced experience, where you either fly solo, with your four-person party, or with game-controlled henchmen.   While it's handy to be able to talk to people once you're outside of town, typically to get help with quests, it's also very nice to not have to compete with an unpredictable number of people for loot and quest-specific beasts and items. It's nice to not have to have eyes in the back of your head for power levelers who have nothing better to do than run around and interfere with you or assault you. For the most part, the frustration level is very low because of these design decisions, even lower than it was many a time when I played World of Warcraft.   But it's not all wine and roses. While Guild Wars is a beautiful game with an extensive story in the non-PvP mode, easy transportation, and more exciting combat than we're used to in RPGs, there are certain elements that suffer in comparison to WoW, its closest competitor. At the top of the list, for me, is getting a party together, and here the user interface is at its weakest. Inviting someone into your party who isn't close enough to be seen means manually typing their name in the chat window. Since all characters have a first and last name, this can be a little tedious, especially if you're racing to invite that person before someone else does.    When LFG (Looking for Group) requests pop up in the general chat channel, there's no way to find out what character class or level that person is, without seeing them in person--and proper team balance can mean the difference between getting through a tough quest on the first try and bashing your head against the wall a half-dozen times. There will be quests where you have to have both a strong melee fighter (~tank,~ in MMO parlance) and a healer.     All players in Guild Wars can add an additional character class to their profile, but there will be points during the game where you have a lot more spells available for one class than you do for another, and it can also be difficult to properly divvy up your skill points among the types of magic available to you. Each class will have four unique magic types, but you'll only have enough points to be truly effective in two, maybe three areas.   Then there's the matter of having only 8 slots in which to put your chosen spells. Compared to, oh, World of Warcraft, this is a joke. Considering that your character will have up to one hundred and fifty spells by the time he or she reaches Level 20 (the current cap), giving us only eight slots is either torture or genius--I haven't decided which. But I really would like a few more slots, regardless of the fact that the skill point system leads toward only two or three schools of magic being truly powerful. Even when I was only halfway to the cap, there was at least one spell I had to regretfully leave behind (as you can't swap out spells once you've left town).    But once you've gotten your party together, it's off to the races, and you'll be heading into an action RPG experience where the speed of health and energy regeneration is the fulcrum on which life and death balance themselves. Energy is always regenerating (barring specific spells that can be cast on you), but health doesn't regen until you've quit fighting. It comes back very fast, though, pretty much eliminating downtime, even more than WoW does. There are no potions for these two elements, and battle is fast and furious.   There really isn't a lot of room for strategy and tactics, for better or worse. GW has an especially high range in which enemies will see you and come running, and your party will often be outnumbered, sometimes significantly. It will get pretty darn hectic, what with multi-target attacks, life drain, mana drain, slowing attacks, et cetera. As monster agro range is so large, and many areas feature burrowed monsters, you will be fighting pretty much continuously during your mission--whether you like it or not. This can be good for experience and loot, but it gets a little tedious sometimes, to be honest. You'll also go through missions in the same order, so the non-PvP experience doesn't have a lot of longevity, despite the variety that dual classing provides.    As fun as combat is, and as pretty as it looks, plowing your way through low-level mobs can and will get tiresome, since they don't give much (if any) experience points and will be dropping items that are virtually useless to you. Monsters will also chase you for quite a good distance, which gets complicated when you combine that with the high ~aggro~ range. I've had a few sections where I was being chased mercilessly by over a dozen beasties, because I simply didn't want to sit there and fight my way through every fifty feet of terrain.   I also think it would be cool if the henchmen would be closer to my level when they join my party. You see, the henchmen are AI-controlled, and there will be one of each class clumped near the entrance of a town. They're free, which is great, and their pathfinding and combat behavior is actually some of the best I've ever seen, but the fact is that they're typically two or three levels below the enemies I'm about to go battle my way through. This means your healer will have fewer, weaker heals in a shorter amount of time, the fighter will have less health, less armor, and do less damage, and so forth. And unlike player characters, they don't have a secondary class, though this never bothered me much.    I'll go along fine through some open stretches, taking a few mobs at a time (they're almost always clumped, and seemingly separate mobs will get triggered when you attack one nearby). But there will eventually be a chokepoint, where you have to deal with a beefy patrol, and your Level 6 brethren probably won't make it against six Level 8 Axe Fiends. Melee fighters can really chop the crap out of a caster. That's nothing new, of course, but when all six of them target a caster, there really is nothing you can do to keep that person from dying. In fact, when a large group of enemies all target the same guy, there's pretty much nothing anyone can do, no matter how beefy the player's character is. I've seen it happen to elementals and warrior monks alike.   I should say, though, that mob placement makes a lot more sense in GW than it has in most other online RPGs. It always seemed odd to me that Stormwind, the stronghold of Azeroth's human empire, would be surrounded by a forest full of vicious animals, homicidal outlaws, and spear-throwing fish men--all just kind of hanging out, wandering idly, and respawning conveniently so that everybody could get their share of loot and experience. GW, on the other hand, takes place in an environment with a context of foreboding evil and sudden cataclysm. The monsters also stay dead when you kill them. You also don't have people spamming annoyances like ~wut iz the name of the guy im supposed to talk 2. any1 kno?~ in the chat window while you're trying to get into an immersive ~Huzzah! I'm in Azeroth!~ groove.     So there are a lot of things to like about Guild Wars, but it's not quite the complete package. It excises tedious travel, but the pursuant joy is hampered by getting bogged down fighting low-level monsters sometimes. Combat is much more satisfying than elsewhere, but I feel like I need one or two more slots for my spells. There's always at least one spell you need but will only (hopefully) use sparingly, like Resurrection. The compass map is quite handy because you can scribble on it, but it doesn't display the names of your party members when you mouse over their dots. A monk also can't resurrect or heal another player's pet.   There's also no auction house, which brings me to another item which enthusiastic early adopters of GW appear to overlook once they're basking in the glow of the game's genuine fun. The problem is that itemization is a little underwhelming. Monsters will never drop pieces of armor, only weapons or ingredients to make items. You also have to pay a hefty fee to an NPC armor crafter on top of gathering or buying the ingredients, and there isn't a lot of armor to choose from. You can differentiate yourself from other players by dyeing separate pieces of clothing, but there are only a few colors to choose from, you don't find them very often during a quest, and they're relatively expensive. World of Warcraft has awesome itemization, by comparison, with a huge amount and variety of stuff to wear and wield, and I wish I'd been able to see and experience some of this in GW. For those of you who come for the action, this won't be of much concern, granted. But those of you looking to do the RP part of an RPG might be disappointed.   Despite these issues, the game has a lot of spirit and energy to it. There are key non-PvP missions that drive you through a pretty long plot arc, and you'll get in-game cutscenes therein that dynamically insert your party into the footage, with the party leader even getting voice-acted dialogue. All of these missions are well crafted and tense. As a whole, in fact, GW missions are based around telling the story of the world around you, rather than telling you to kill a guy, gather a certain number of items and bring them back, or take this item to some other guy who's apparently too shiftless to get it himself.    I find this quite satisfying, and I think most people will find this system to be a refreshing diversion from the usual. The lack of respawn and the lack of other players milling around for their turn to kill Lord Badguy lends a sense of accomplishment to what is otherwise usually an ordeal you have to withstand because you want a chunk of experience points or a specific item. Instead of delivering items, you're usually retrieving them from places only heroic fighters like yourself can dare go. Instead of working your way through a dungeon so you can finally reach the big boss who drops phat lewt, you're working to eradicate an evil that's been plaguing the land. The mission setups become more than a pretense for character advancement and actually become the neat little adventures that MMOs promise but rarely deliver.   But I should also talk about PvP, which is an entirely separate game. You can have four characters per account, and you choose either the non-PvP game I've been describing, or PvP play, which puts you in a completely different environment with a character at the level cap. You can choose your two class types, your specific spells, armor, and weapons--the whole deal. There is one caveat with spell choice, though. If you choose to manually select your skills, you only get access to what you've unlocked in the non-PvP half. If you're starting right off in PvP, you'll only have a small selection of skills. They're still useful and comprehensive, but there's some neat stuff you'll never have access to until you've worked your way through the non-PvP half. You can buy some spells in non-PvP mode, but only at the rate at which you would discover them. In other words, at level 10, you'll have maybe a dozen spells you can buy that you might come across at that stage of character development, had you chosen the right quests.   Otherwise, you can choose from PvP templates, which give you access to spells you may never come across. The drawback of this is that you only get the pre-slotted extra spells, and the selection won't be as strong as it would for someone who'd unlocked everything in non-PvP. The popular warrior monk combo (a paladin, in other words) has a few niceties, but his template isn't something I would personally consider taking into battle.     Still, PvP can be a lot of fun. Right now, you have several different types of arena you can play in. There's two-team, eight-player deathmatch, where the teams are randomly slapped together, and the same game type where you choose you fight with, and a third DM type where you choose your team and have a game-controlled priest who will periodically resurrect dead players. Then there's the Tomb of Primeval Kings and a couple other neat areas.   The Tomb is a series of team PvP challenges you have to go through, like a gauntlet, and it includes game types highly reminiscent of first-person shooters, actually. You have capture the flag, king of the hill, straightforward team-versus-team elimination, and an exciting battle royale mode where up to six eight-player teams battle it out for supremacy. Europe, Korea, and America are also subdivided into three factions, and whoever completes the gauntlet earns ~the favor of the gods~ for his faction. When that happens, players in that faction have access to an additional area of the world where they can poke around and get some neat gear to gain the edge against those who don't yet have favor.   Being able to scribble and ~ping~ on the compass comes in very handy in PvP, and there's a large enough contingent of MMO-type players at this point that most people typically know what they're doing when they get in the arena. Focus on the healers, gang up on people, and don't give anyone enough time to think or regroup. Some people will stray, and others will mindlessly focus on whatever enemy that happens to be closest to them. But often you get a good group and you just beat the heck out of everybody. And you earn ~fame points~ that gradually earn you better items.Sure, there's no player-created items, or mounts, or housing, or auction houses. But there's also no monthly fee, a rapid patching infrastructure, very fast load times, a pretty engine, frantic but fun combat, drastically reduced FedEx and kill quests, and miniscule travel tedium. I still think aggro range is too high, though, and getting attacked by a steady queue of monsters whom it's virtually pointless to fight stacks on top of the aggro annoyance. I'd like to see cooler loot, more (and less expensive) armor, and more spell slots. As I've said before, though, these are annoyances that can be adjusted, rather than being or suggesting fundamental flaws in design. If anything, the core design of GW looks rock-solid.  ArenaNet huge team has a royal load of gaming experience--but not a whole lot of persistent online experience, and that could be why a few problems crop up in the game--for me, at least. At this point, though, with their roster and this polished production, I think both ArenaNet and Guild Wars have nowhere to go but up, and I'm already looking forward to whatever they cook up next.", "date": "May 11, 2005"}
