Take Tecmo for instance. It's a quirky Japanese publisher and developer that outputs all sorts of loony horse simulations on PlayStation 2 (three Gallop Racers to be exact), and then gives only Xbox players the pleasure of Ninja Gaiden, Dead Or Alive 3, and Dead Or Alive Ultimate. Then, in a stroke of weirdness, it teams up with well-renowned RPG maker GameArts and cranks out a potentially good game with so little flare, panache, or punch, you wonder who beat up GameArts' mech development team.   Enter GunGriffon: Allied Strike, the eccentric mech-action game that falls apart in nearly every category, but somehow manages to remain fun. Allied Strike has a backwards charm that one must fight to see. It's hidden somewhere behind the unimaginably poor graphics, sound, and presentation, and I might be going out on a limb here, but there is something about this game that's terribly likeable. Most folks will take one good look at it, hold their nose, and turn away. Can't blame 'em, really. But for those who like something a little old-fashioned and off-beat, Allied Strike could be their game.    Gameplay  Pinning it down is simple enough. Allied Strike features 12-plus mechs or AWGS (armored walking gun system) containing some of the most funky, bizarre, and downright silly designs you'll see in a mech game. In each of the 13 single-player campaign missions, you not only get to pick from the full roster of AWGS right away, you equip them and pick a ~friend.~ The picking and experimenting with AWGS becomes a small strategy game in itself, as they range in style from well-rounded to four-legged to snipe-heavy to highly mobile to jet-like in quality. The type of selectable weapons is decent enough to make a small difference in carrying out those strategies.    The game hinges on your AWG selections and how well you exercise their special abilities. So, if you've picked a unit with great flight ability, you should take advantage of flying to enemy pods, striking quickly, and taking off; after all, the excellent flying units are also known for their light armor. Likewise, if you select a four-legged spider, you'll want to use the rollerdashes to turn tail and run when overwhelmed with quick-moving enemy forces. It's really the flying and rollerdashes that distinguish Tecmo's title and bring out its best qualities. It might be a funkily presented game and it might look awful, but playing with blazing-fast flying mechs and quickly rollerdashing across large landscapes brings a lightning attack strategy to what could be an otherwise standard game. And, like I said before, it's straight-up fun.   The missions range from basic attack-and-destroy to protect-and-defend, and they seldom waver from that basic format. Usually destroying everything in sight and following the goals is the best way to go. Since there are no powerups at all, you instead rendezvous with a support helicopter to restock ammunition. The downside to the support copter is that it only appears for 20 seconds on the opposite side of the field, and it may be surrounded by enemies -- a strange design that makes one scratch their head and wonder if there weren't easily five better places for that copter to be. The other bummer is that if you're engaged in heavy combat, you could miss your restocking altogether, which almost always means you're screwed. (The copter comes two to three times a mission.)   Locate your enemy and pummel them with lead! Allied Strike is at its best when it asks players to defend bases. In several of these levels, enemy forces do a superb job of vexing your strategies, disorienting your plans, and potentially beating you quickly and easily if you're not prepared. Whether it's protecting a moving convoy, defending an airport strip, what have you, these missions provide the most intensity and greatest challenge.   But Tecmo's game is more often than not at odds with itself. Though there are 13 levels, they do not progressively become more difficult. Instead, the level designs are way out of balance, with some early missions being quite harder than suspected, intermingled with levels you can finish in less than two minutes (basically way too easy). Enemies are often represented by boxy outlines, which often cram the screen. Though these boxes look technical and cool at some aesthetic level, they're equally annoying. As for movement and believability, the framerate is chunky and sluggish, stuttering at the beginning of each level, and regularly ending levels at vague intervals.      The single-player campaign will take a dedicated player anywhere from six to 10 hours. The game only has two difficulty levels, easy and normal, starting by default on easy. The Normal levels are designed for better players, but they're just as unbalanced and wonky as the easy ones, only you just can't take as many hits. The game doesn't offer any upgrades, powerups or any progression rewards, other than opening up new AWGS. That's fine, but they aren't always better units -- they're often just different. So, instead of a logical evolution of better and better mechs, it's more like a tapestry of weirder and more experimental ones. Again, you can look at this as the provision of more strategy and experimentation, or just plain strangeness on the developer's part.     The game's potentially big addition is online play. You can connect with up to eight total players online in Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Players who want to connect with a buddy for a cooperative game can play through the single-player campaign mode online with a partner. The online game is as good as the single-player game but with more people and more technical snafus. In other words, all of the problems -- framerate, stuttering, poor visibility due to bad graphics, and chunkiness -- are enhanced two-fold online. So, if you struggled to like the offline experience, the online offerings can be brutal. On the other hand, if you liked the offline experience, this small set of AWGS romps could extend the fun.   Graphics  This is where GunGriffon: Allied Strike sinks big-time. There is nothing about the quality of these graphics that remotely suggest it's an Xbox game. Honestly, if you shortened up the landscapes a bit, this could easily have been mistaken for a high-res PlayStation game. The color palette is dulled with earthen tones, and then seemingly worn down by the low resolution and dull, unimpressive textures. It's easily one of the worst looking Xbox games of 2004.    The depth of field is small, though a realtime map and a long-distance scope helps to relieve the lack of depth. You can change your perspective from in-cockpit to over the shoulder, but by doing so, you'll then see your AWGS animate, which shows off how raw and basic even the animations are. There is no sense of physics, shocks or repercussion when a giant foot hits the ground. Instead, you'll watch a spider type mech walk perfectly smoothly across the landscape with its legs robotically moving back and forth. The 32-bit generation may only seem like a few years ago, but this game make one feel like it was built in the stone ages. Overall, the game's wincingly bad visuals, poor presentation, sluggish menus, and under-par animation will not win you over. It's just plain ugly stuff.    Pick from a wacky list of funktastic AWGS. Sound  So it's December and I've been playing this game for hours, right, because I don't have much to do, and I could have sworn there was only one song. But how wrong I was! There are lots of songs, as I discovered by checking the sound option. It's just that they all sound the same. Sure, there are some variances, and perhaps some decent mech-like tunes in here, but overall, the music, comprised of military-sounding strings and drums, sounds all the same. The ineffective and often muffled set of sound effects are equally poor.It appears that from the mail I've received and the low-budget hype from Tecmo, there isn't too much riding on the sales of GunGriffon: Allied Strike. As it should be. GameArts' sequel has some game chops, fleshed out in the meatier offline defense battles and in the Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, but this game won't thrill you for long. Or at all, depending on your patience for ugly, technically inferior games. But there are kernels of fun to be found, you just have to have a soft spot for GameArts, Tecmo or mech games in general. Or you could just buy MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf.", "date": "Dec 16, 2004"}
