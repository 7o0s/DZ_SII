First, that it's out. Second, that it lives up to 13 years of anticipation. While many old timers remember the good old days when Lucas Arts and Sierra were releasing loads of humorous adventure games, the genre has really been underrepresented over the last few years. Even when we do get a title that tries to recapture that magic, the results are less than satisfying.  We're glad to say that's not the case with the new Sam and Max: Episode 1 - Culture Shock. Here's a title that's done the seemingly impossible: faithfully updating a beloved franchise while creating something that feels entirely fresh and original. The first of a projected six-part monthly series, this initial installment is sure to please fans of humor, fans of adventure games and the legion of Sam and Max devotees who have been waiting like demented lagomorphs for a return of the deranged duo.   For the benefit of our readers who aren't familiar with the original Sam and Max: Hit the Road or the comics or cartoons, a word of explanation is in order. Sam and Max are an unlikely pair of freelance policemen, that is to say, opportunists with delusions of law enforcement. Sam is a suit-wearing dog who plays the straight (well, straightish) man in the team. His partner Max is a psychotic, encephalitic rabbity thing for whom the shortest distance between two points is often a violent, twisty squiggle.  Their first and only PC adventure, released in 1993, was a 2D point and click affair that saw them driving across America in search of, among other things, Big Foot. The long-awaited sequel perfectly preserves the things that we liked about the original game: the outrageous humor, the unlikely situations, and of course, the Desoto.  I don't want to give away any of the particulars of the story because the main point of playing the game is to experience the story, not to exercise your logic problem skills. Let's just say that it involves an incredibly popular Eye-Bo ocular fitness DVD, three brainwashed (and washed-up) child stars, a security conscious clerk at an inconvenient convenience store and a former tattoo artist turned psychotherapist. I will say that the villain here is kind of a letdown. He's easily the least funny, least interesting part of the game and the climax of the game suffers because of it. Still, the whole story leading up to the final showdown is hilarious enough to carry you through.   Even though the villain is a bit of a letdown, the whole script is fantastic with plenty of the zaniness I remember from the first game. From the VCR that smells like asparagus to the new concept of ~shopdropping~ (the opposite of ~shoplifting,~ naturally), the whole game is full of jokes and ideas that you're bound to laugh at. I only wish that the writers had been willing to go just one step further and bring a little more absurdity into the whole thing. While the talking dog and rabbit thing are odd enough, everything else in the game seems just one shade too sane for you to totally lose yourself in the experience.  Of the few dozen puzzles in the game only a handful will really challenge your problem solving skills. Most have simple one-part solutions and are as easy and as obvious as flipping on a light switch. In fact, flipping a light switch actually does solve one of the smaller puzzles in the game. In the rare case where you're confronted with a tougher puzzle, you can usually find the answer by rechecking the items in your inventory and imagining how they might apply to the situation in front of you. There's no way to break the game so you'll be able to try out various solutions to the problems until you find one that works.      Depending on how good you are at figuring these things out, this first episode of Sam and Max could last you anywhere from two to four hours. That doesn't sound like a terribly long time but there are no down spots here. Every object, every interaction, and every sequence has some sort of significance here, even if you can't spot it the first time you run through it.   The interface is much simpler than the one in the original Sam and Max (or in Telltale's Bone). Rather than relying on complicated inventory juggling, the interface in Sam and Max lets players use, examine, take or give items all based on context. Just click on an item and you'll do the right thing with it. This means you'll be using your brainpower to solve the puzzles instead of using it to wrestle with the designer's intentions.    If there's a low point for the interface, it's the short driving sequence. While I agree that a full on action mode wouldn't work for the game, the point and click controls for the car are just too sluggish and make the entire sequence a little unnatural.  Opinions will be probably divided about the voices. Those who have played the original game recently (or whose memories are unusually good) will notice that that the new voice actors for Sam and Max are just a little less goofy and manic this time around. It doesn't exactly fit with Max's character but, personally, I think the drier delivery helps the humor, particularly with Sam. The other voice actors turn in great performances as well, especially the three former child stars who find themselves in new and unexpected lines of work.  The music fits perfectly. The jazz soundtrack completely underscores the whole film noir, hipster atmosphere of the game, making it both wacky and strangely sophisticated at the same time. It's the perfect tone for the action and worthy enough to stand apart from the game.   It's hard to translate a 2D cartoon to 3D but the artists have done a fantastic job. The characters all seem soft and flexible and the textures have a real substance to them. It all looks a bit more substantial than the graphics in the recent Leisure Suit Larry game but it still retains a cartoon-like quality that works well with the humor.  There are loads of humorous details in the world, from the tire tracks on the wall of the office to the ~for rent~ sign over the Esperanto bookstore. Pretty much everywhere you look there's something to laugh at, and the characters will sometimes even offer amusing comments on their surroundings.  Finally, the game runs brilliantly. I'm really impressed with what the team has done with the engine. On a high end PC, you'll really be able to appreciate high-res graphics and a really stable, consistent framerate. Add to that the fact that there we found no bugs, no glitches, no mistakes of any kind, and it's easy to see why we're so impressed with the overall presentation. Now let's see if Telltale can maintain these standards and still deliver a new episode each month.Adventure gaming might not be back yet, but this long-awaited sequel does a lot to renew my faith in the genre. The point and click format certainly isn't going to supplant real-time strategy or first-person shooting as the PC's bread and butter but the gameplay here is almost incidental to the experience. The real joy of playing Sam and Max is in watching the hilarious interactions unfold and in spotting the throwaway jokes hidden in magazine racks and picture frames.The only real downside here is that the game doesn't quite approach the level of screwball humor sound in the original game. It wavers on the edge sometimes, like it wants to fall over into absurdity but just isn't sure enough to take the plunge. Since this is the first in a series of episodes, we're hoping that the developers are just getting warmed up.", "date": "Oct 17, 2006"}
