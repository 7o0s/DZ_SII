So what is it? Whether it's the hit animated cartoon show or the Hasbro toy line of the same name, the premise is unchanged, and that is for kids to compete in planned battles with their Beyblades, or spinning tops. The idea is to bump the tops into one's opponent and stop it from spinning or send it out of the arena. The concept couldn't be simpler, and this is largely why there's no need to do it in videogame form, especially if the videogame is as poorly conceived as this.  The Facts  Based on the popular Beyblade license Pit tops against each other in tricked-out stadiums More than 150 Beyblade customizations possible Send Bit Beasts dueling against each other in mid-battle Features animated elements that move along the gameplay Bargain bin price of $29.99   Gameplay Developer Takara made this game before. The previous version was simply called Beyblade and it was for the original PlayStation. The presentation of this new build, which may as well be a port, is identical, as are the gameplay fundamentals and the graphics. What we have here is a very archaic product and its age shows in just about every respect.  Take away all of the poorly introduced anime-style cut-scenes and near-useless customization options, and players are left with the meat and potatoes of Tournament Battle, which is, conveniently enough, taking part in Tournament Battles with the Beyblades. What this really means is pitting two spinning tops against each other in tiny, unvaried ~stadiums.~ Anybody not familiar with the Beyblade franchise will undoubtedly be awestruck by the shallow premise. Meanwhile, anybody who does know Beyblade will also know that they can play with the real franchise tops for far cheaper and to greater satisfaction.  These truths are pounded all the deeper with every minute playing Takara's redundant digital re-creation of the hobby. Control is limited. A gage charges and players are required to hit a button at the right time for maximum spin, and then the battle begins. By battle, we mean two dreidels that bump into each other in a tiny, unimpressive arena. Manipulation of these tops is once more limited -- it's impossible to move them quickly or with any great degree of precision; instead, one will have to settle for the generation direction of their tops' opponent and hope for the best.  The play is confusing -- disorienting even -- because gamers simply don't see too many games like this. It takes some getting used to and admittedly once one does there is some measure of fun to be gained. Even with the added complexity of being able to use Bit Beasts -- or magical apparitions such as dragons and tornados that can be summoned onto one's opponent -- the simplicity of it all will eventually drown over even the most undemanding gamers and boredom will settle in for the long haul.   Graphics Half of Beyblade consists of menus and unanimated cut-scenes. It's primitive stuff, but not so primitive as the actual play, which looks like something a 16-year-old kid might have illustrated and then coded in his garage just for kicks. Polygons have been used, shall we say, sparingly, and the animation of these tops is passable but just barely. Meanwhile, players can keep an eye out for dazzling lighting and shadow effects, reflections, multiple texture layers and much more. They won't find them, but they can look out for them.  Sound Like everything else, sub-par. Subdued music mingles with virtually no voice work for an experience that is every bit as aurally dull as it is visually. There's no point in writing any more.Beyblade is a baffling game that is both so niche and so ill-executed that I can only recommended to the true fanatics out there who devour anything the franchise has to offer. Everyone else will be downright insulted by the simple, stupid game mechanics and horrendously outdated visual and audio presentations. This title does not look, sound or act any differently from its PS1 predecessor, which is a travesty.Stay as far away from this unfortunate digital afterbirth as possible.", "date": "Nov 4, 2003"}
