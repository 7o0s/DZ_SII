Apple answered the call with the generically titled Texas Hold'em, a solid rendition of the ultra-popular poker variant that still holds considerable sway over pop culture.   If you're familiar with Texas, you know exactly what to expect out of the iPod game. Following a tutorial for newcomers -- or anybody that wants to be acquainted with click-wheel controls before sitting down at a high-stakes table -- you're dealt your cards and the game is on. Apple uses the high-gloss iPod screen to recreate a series of casinos and tables where you challenge a variety of opponents. There are two views in the game, but eschewing the top-down camera for a straight shot at the other players reveals one of the game's more interesting wrinkles: tics and tells.   Your opponents are played by real people (not profession card players, though) that have a series of tells they use while you play. I'm not going to give any away here, but if you watch the screen carefully after the cards are dealt, you should spy facial expressions and gestures that reveal strong hands or weak cards. This is a great feature, but it eventually becomes a weak spot, as the tells aren't terribly varied. Once you memorize a player's particulars, you can sail through a game with a degree of confidence that undermines the wild nature of poker. However, even with these tics under your belt, you still must occasionally deal with reckless behavior and absolute asinine moves, such as going all-in on a weak hand. Anybody who plays poker online, though, knows that even if this is irritating, it's quite accurate. Amateurs with too much time or money play poker like a bull in a china shop -- but you know they say about a fool and his funds...   The click wheel has been a thorn to some of the launch games, but the unique input works well in Texas Hold'em. Scrolling through cards or raising bets is easy and unobtrusive, something that cannot be said about the disastrous Bejeweled. The custom soundtrack feature in iPod games works in Texas Hold'em's favor as the music is this game is forgettable. Apple's Vortex may have to putting that new Scissor Sisters album aside for a few moments, but you'll be pulling out Jake Shears for a go when you sit down at these tables.  Texas Hold'em is one of the stronger launch games on Apple's service. I suspect that advanced players will find it way too easy to hold their attention for long, but amateurs like me can have a good time playing a few hands and watching for tells. The game looks good, the stat tracking features are a nice addition, and the game is smart enough to fast-forward through the remainder of a table after you go busto.
