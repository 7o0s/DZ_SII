After playing Glu Mobile's Kasparov Chess, I'm sitting on one tender bum.   That's Kasparov Chess as in, Gary Kasparov, the grandmaster and World Chess Champion who held the top worldwide rank an unprecedented 23 times and was also the last undisputed World Chess Champion from 1985 to 1993.  I know all of this because the game handily includes a brief bio.   I'm hard pressed to distinguish one chess game from another, so let me say this: Kasparov Chess looks and plays like a real chess game.  The game also covers the tedious function that most of my real, live chess opponents must serve; i.e. shouting, ~You can't move that piece that way!~   In the game, you select a piece on your side (you get to choose between white and black).  Any squares open to that piece are highlighted; move the cursor to select which way to move, or switch to a different piece when you realize you probably shouldn't expose your Queen on the second move.  This function handily eliminates my standard head-scratching, trying to recall whether it's the Bishop that moves in the ~L~ formation, or the Horsie.   You can see, perhaps, that I'm no match for Kasparov.  Nor am I a worthy opponent to the game for which the legendary chess master serves as advisor; even on the easiest setting, I was roundly trounced again and again by the computer.  (There is some irony in the notion that, as the namesake for this game, Kasparov is assuming the role provided by Deep Blue in their well-publicized man-versus-computer matches.)   As someone who can only play chess against a person who is also constitutionally incapable of thinking more than three moves in advance, I cannot speak to the uniqueness of Kasparov's game play.  Frankly, it played like chess to me.  The pieces moved the right way, the movements were intuitive, and I got pummeled.  So, maybe I should turn my attention to Kasparov's additional features.   To start with, you can select your own chessboard theme, choosing between Classic Ebony, Rosewood, Sandalwood, Alabaster, and Amethyst.  Each is pretty in its own right; I prefer the Alabaster, myself.  Choose whether you want a straight overhead 2D perspective or a great-looking, slightly tilted, 3D view of the board.  You can also save your games for those long, truly nerve-wracking, marathon sessions.   If you're a serious chess buff, the game allows you to access your move history, presumably so you can isolate that crippling, head-smacking moment where you biffed it (or, possibly, so you can pump your fist a few more times for the instant you outsmarted that know-it-all Kasparov muckety-muck).  You can also take back previous moves using an option from the game menu or the asterisk key.  Obviously, this is a distinct advantage over the real thing -- just trying taking moves back against a live opponent.   If the computer seems an impossible opponent to beat, you'll appreciate the online component of Kasparov, which enables you to play live or as a correspondence game, meaning you can make a move even when your opponents are not online.  I like this feature in particular, because it reminds me of all those movies where academic types (or supervillains) keep a chess board with an ongoing, long-distance game, usually against another key character (I've never seen this done in real life, only in movies).  You can choose to be auto-matched against any online player, or select your own by entering his/her User ID.  This should be easy, since anytime you play online, your opponent's User ID is automatically entered into your list (you can play up to 15 concurrent games at any time).  This feature means Kasparov Chess could, at least in theory, turn out to be a great online matchmaking program, too.   If you would rather test your luck against the computer, choose between Solo Play or Pass'n Play (pass the phone back and forth with a friend).  If you want my advice, find a friend who thinks the Knight is called a ~Horsie~ -- you stand a much better chance.While one chess game sure seems a lot like another, Kasparov Chess plays smoothly and attractively, with a nice plethora of options to offer a unique experience with each game.  The online feature offers a chance to play against an opponent that can actually be beaten.  What's more, the Kasparov endorsement can't be topped -- unless, of course, some lucky developer nabs the elusive Bobby Fischer license.", "date": "Feb 26, 2007"}
