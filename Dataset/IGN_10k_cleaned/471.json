There's nothing specifically wrong with the classic games themselves, but there are several side issues that get in the way of enjoying the combined Pac-Man, Ms Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Pole Position, Galaga, Galaxian experience. At such a cheap price --we've seen it for as little as $29.99-- and considering they're games that most of us have played to death, it may seem a little anal to pick on things like graphics and game saving features. However it is because Mass Media didn't have any gameplay issues or N64 specific innovations to worry about, that we can't understand some of the things that have been overlooked, left out and, in some cases, left in Namco Museum.  Gameplay We really shouldn't have to explain the ins and outs of this family of videogame forefathers but we'll give you a quick once-over for those of you that just arrived from Pluto and decided to pick up Nintendo's splendid 3D platform. Pac-Man and Ms Pac Man ask you to maneuver a big yellow dot around a maze, eating little dots while avoiding evil ghosts that kill on contact. Your only weapons are power pills that render the ghosts blue and suddenly edible. Quick decision making and development of so-called ~patterns~ provide the thrills here.  Galaga and Galaxian are a pair of Space Invader clones that up the ante in the strategy department thanks to a couple of key innovations in enemy abilities. Galaxian has you in a rocket-launcher mobile base thing that can slide back and forth allowing you to shoot at those tightly formatted packs of hovering alien critters. There're no shields like in SI, but your ship is a little more maneuverable. You'll need that extra mobility because the aliens in this one --gasp-- make attack runs where they break formation and come after you with death dealing bombs. Galaga has the same attacking aliens as Galaxian but this time they attack in groups and they have the cool tractor beam ability that lets them capture your ship. Videogame innovation wasn't what it is now back in the early '80s so the idea that you should let them capture your ship was way out there. Why would you commit such a treasonous act? Because you could reacquire your captured ship and pair it with the backup ship you'd been forced to use and have a kick ass double barreled attack. Brilliant  Pole Position was a racing game based in a universe where car damage does not exits. The rules are simple, complete the best times around the track to qualify for a good starting position in the real race and, oh yeah, you're not allowed to touch any other cars. The exploding cars are great considering the chase camera point of view continues at racing speed before steadily slowind down as you're car disappears into a ball of flame.  Dig Dug is still one of the most clever games to come out in the history of videogames. Your little Smurf like character has to dig underground to rid this garden of all the little fire-breathing dragons and goggled red balloons to advance. Armed with only a quick action air pump with considerable reach and a few precariously positioned rocks the action gets faster and more intense, like most of the best old school arcade games, once you get past the beginner levels.   And that is how you'll play the games featured in Namco Museum. The different games will allow you to alter the settings like the number of lives you'll start of with, how many points are needed for an extra life and difficulty. These are the switches your little 7-11 owner used to mess with to keep you and your buddies running back to the counter for change hour after hour. Pole Position allows you to change the controller configuration and qualifying requirements if you really want to get into the game's innards.  Tinkering with a game's settings should be a part of a classic games collection since many gamers will be out for the immediate challenge to find out if they've still ~got it.~ What we don't understand is why a Start Up Mode has been included other than to appeal to the most hardcore videogame purists. What does Start Up Mode get you? A bunch of squiggly lines and jibberish on screen that used to happen when the old cabinet games were first booted up for the day. Each time you start up one of the classic games with Start Up Mode enabled, you'll get the boot up screens and animations as if you'd just plugged the big old stand up arcade into a wall outlet.  While this was a great way to reset the high scores --that always seemed to happen as soon as we got the top spot-- back in the day, it's not totally necessary in Namco Museum. You have to save your top performances to a memory pak of all things. While carrying a little mem pak around as proof of your dominance is easier than lugging the whole machine, it seems a little silly that Mass Media couldn't implement a save feature that would keep high scores on the cartridge until you wanted to erase them. This is one of the things that should've been optimized for use with the N64.  Sound There's not as much here as on PSX versions of Namco Museums. The main title screen is the only new bit of music you'll get. You get a nice contemporary mix that includes well timed samples of key sound effects from each of the games.   All of the game sounds and music have been perfectly reproduced. All of the wakka wakkas from Pac Man and the ~pshew~ sound from the Galaxian missile launcher are all flawless. Dig Dug still has some of the most stimulating music in videogame history. Not many N64 games have flawless sound elements, but then again, not many N64 games have the advantage of being made up of a collection of wonderfully nostalgic, yet technically primitive mini games.  Graphics We're pretty much willing to let a lot slide when it comes to graphics in Namco Museum. A lot of the old style arcade games were run on extra long monitors that just don't fit on any television that you'd have hooked up to your N64. The compensate for this games like Pac Man and Galaxian have still graphics on the left and right sides of the screen that would seem to be mimicking the actual painted glass cabinets of the arcade machines. These graphics wouldn't be so bad if they didn't look so clunky.  We know the graphics from old school games were not the sharpest but it seemed to us that a little higher resolution wouldn't have been too much to ask for Namco Museum. Pac Man wasn't a perfectly round dot in the original game, but you almost wish he was now that he's on the N64. At the very least the text should be a lot crisper and cleaner so that ~HIGH SCORE~ doesn't look like ~Ml6M $OOBS~ on your screen.    The only thing that really irked us was the scrolling in Dig Dug. There's not supposed to be any scrolling in Dig Dug. The game originally ran on an extremely long screen and so to make it work on your rectangular television, the game has to scroll down ever so slightly to reveal the lower most parts of the playing field. It's a little thing but we wish it would go away.  Namco Museum may only be 30 bucks but I think a better time might be had running out and finding these six games in an arcade somewhere and blowing five bones on each of them. I wouldn't recommend it for a rental because there's nothing new to try out here. What are you going to do? Check to see if Pac Man has arms and legs now? You either dig these games or you don't and so you should either purchase it or keep walking. I would think that any older videogame player, the kind that only has World Driver Championship and GoldenEye, in his or her library would really appreciate Namco Museum. If you want some nice familiar games to help you unwind or something safe and simple to entertain undemanding friends then this collection of games is right up your alley. Plus it seems to be a quick 30 dollar symbol of peace between Namco and Nintendo and that bodes well for the rest of us that want to see Tekken on the next generation Nintendo console.", "date": "Dec 1, 1999"}
