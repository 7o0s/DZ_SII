{"name": "Bewitched", "name_review": "Bewitched", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/23/bewitched-3", "text": "Since mobile gaming is still relatively ~new~ to the average consumer, expectations are all over the map. For example, if you saw the name Bewitched pop up on your game deck, what kind of game would you expect it to be? A side-scrolling action game? A shooter that replaces a spaceship with a flying broom? Or a middling trivia game with barely enough hooks into the upcoming summer comedy flick to qualify as a movie tie-in?   If you guessed the last option, you're more than set to be satisfied with Bewitched. The game attempts to capitalize on the upcoming Will Ferrell-Nicole Kidman movie, but gamers that grab it will likely be surprised that the game has absolutely no elements from the movie in it whatsoever. Bewitched is based on the classic television series. This begs the question: Had there been no updated movie, would Sony have even bothered publishing this game? Doubtful. Which makes this less of a game and more of a marketing tool.   Bewitched is something of a rudimentary ~Trivial Pursuit~ style game, where you must wind your way around the board answering questions from four different categories, such as trivia about the old TV show, post-war pop culture, and the supernatural. Get an answer right and you continue, racking up points. Get three wrong and it's game over. But, not really, as you can play a variation on the ~shell game~ to restart, but with a serious hit on your point count. It's actually hard to screw up this mini-game, so there is no real consequence for answering questions wrong. The ultimate goal is to reach the center of the screen to rescue Darrin, who has been kidnapped by the meddling Endora.   The questions are a mixed bag. The supernatural questions seemed entirely too easy, while the queries about ~Bewitched~ factoids will likely stump younger players. No offense to his family, but is producer Sol Saks a household name?   The game itself seems like a rush job -- it's kinda messy. The images for Samantha and Darrin are fine little drawings, by Endora sure gets the ugly stick treatment. The board just sorta lays there, a winding line strung with colored circles that act as spaces. Is this Bewitched or Zuma?  Bewitched just comes across as too much of a shallow marketing tool to me. I doubt the game would have been produced had there been no upcoming movie because, well, nobody was clamoring for a trivia game that actually featured an entire category devoted to ~Bewitched~ factoids. And I think most gamers -- casual and hardcore -- can small tools like this from a mile away. The game feels a little thrown together, like somebody had decided at the last minute to hire a developer to create a game -- any game -- to support the upcoming movie.", "date": "Jun 23, 2005"}
