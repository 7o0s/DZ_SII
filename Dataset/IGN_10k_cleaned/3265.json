Bad rock 'n' roll game soundtracks have to be among some of the worst things on this planet. Techno just seems to work so much better in video games. Even bad techno is better than wailing guitars.  Johnny Bazookatone is your basic side-scroller. Sure the characters are well designed and the backgrounds are nice and colorful, but what it all comes down to is that this has been loads of times before, and ten times better. Add to that an unfairly high level of difficulty and you've got yourself a frustrating little game.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
