{"name": "Nightmare Creatures II", "name_review": "Nightmare Creatures II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/13/nightmare-creatures-ii", "text": "The Nightmare Creatures 2 box has an incredible cover.  The artwork depicting the torn and tattered Herbert Wallace, with Adam Crowley's despicable face visible as an image in the distant moon manages to scream out, ~Buy me, play me!~.  Unfortunately, if you dig a little deeper - ie, actually tearing off the wrapper, opening the jewel case, and giving the game a go - you'll find yourself with a title that disappoints on pretty much every level.  You take control of an axe-equipped Wallace through multiple stages of fighting-adventure, in an effort to exact revenge against your once captor, Crowley himself.  You wander the free-roaming levels by mostly running and jumping, but also by swimming, grabbing onto ledges and climbing ladders.  You're required to find keys in order to open up occasional doors, and even set dynamite in some areas to blow open paths. Along the way, you'll find health items and weapons strewn about.  It's the basic stuff of adventuring, but Nightmare Creatures 2 adds a bit to the formula due to its reliance on one-on-one fights.  Throughout the levels, the game enters into a cinematic mode as enemies burst through windows and doors, or leap down from ledges, some occasionally managing to scare you with their entrances.  Approach the enemy, and you'll find yourself locked into a battle, Kain-style.  You can unleash a kicking attack, two forms of slashes with your axe, a blocking maneuver, or toss out a number of special projectiles, and once you've reduced your foe's energy to the barest minimum, you're given the option of executing an ultra gory finishing move.  The battle system is more than just simple punches and kicks, as it allows for a few simple combos.  It's nothing too complex, though, and going through the game's ~therapy~ training mode will help you to figure out the system quickly.   The battle system is, alas, the start of the game's many problems.  The fighting is often reduced to the dastardly you hit the enemy, the enemy hits you, you hit the enemy, the enemy hits you form of repetition, something which isn't necessarily as bad as it sounds considering the abundance of health items in the levels.  However, I was never confident enough in the system's integrity to actually make use of the combos, and found myself achieving greater success by attacking, then blocking and hoping for the best.  Add multiple enemies to a fight, something which happens quite frequently, and you have a horrible mess, where the second enemy usually won't attack unless you're positioned in such a way that you're facing both enemies at once.  For a game where fighting takes so central a role, more thought should have been given to the actual fighting system.   Maybe it's the poor control over Wallace that gets in the way here.  I know this guy is supposed to be broken after undergoing years of torture, but it's difficult to get used to the control, and once you do it still feels choppy and unresponsive.  Even the adventure parts have control issues.  Moving Wallace through a level is a bit faster than in something like Tomb Raider, but still feels too slow and limiting, especially due to the lack of analogue control.  Jumping shouldn't be so difficult, and why isn't there some means of looking around at the level?  The overall feel of the game is one of boredom more than anything.  The levels go on and on, with fight after fight after fight, and you may find yourself tired before you get to the end.  That actually seems to be the only point of the levels, getting to the end so a cinematic sequence can take over and lead you on to the next level, and this grows old quickly.  Furthermore, there are so many inconsistencies throughout the world that you'll probably grow frustrated even before you've grown bored, asking such questions as ~how come I can break this chair when this other chair is invincible,~ or ~how come I can't grab onto this ledge when I just pulled myself up over that one?~.  The only redeeming factor that will potentially make you play through Nightmare Creatures 2 are its artistic elements.  The creatures are nicely designed entities, varying in shape and size, and as mentioned, their cinematic entrances are grand and nicely choreographed, although the occasional pause for loading does take away from the effect.  The game's graphics artists have done a great job in filling the world with atmosphere, as the levels are nicely made representations of the streets of London, her interiors, and her underground.  The sound team, while inexcusably giving us a minimum for sound effects, has actually done a nice job in keeping a constant humming in the background, rather than an actual looping soundtrack - it adds a subtlety to the surroundings that would possibly be ruined by a hard rock soundtrack.  Rob Zombie does provide some heavy duty tunage mostly for the cinematic sequences between levels, and his tracks fit nicely with the on-screen proceedings.  And let's not forget the utterly cool character that is Herbert Wallace.  I'm not saying I'm for the whole bandage-faced character thing, but Wallace looks the part of a classic gaming character (uhh... when he stands still, that is - see below), and there's something majestic about the way in which he finishes off an enemy with a barrage of axe swipes.  I also like how Wallace goes through a door - he doesn't just open it, he kicks it down and then proceeds.  If he weren't so ugly, he'd definitely get the chicks.  Unfortunately, these cinematic and artistic elements are hampered by Kalisto's making no mistake about the title's origin on the PlayStation.  Nightmare Creatures 2, while technically impressive on Sony's aging system, ends up looking downright ugly running on Dreamcast.  We're talking the same textures that were featured in the PlayStation version of the game (at least, that's what it looks like) and possibly the worst clipping ever seen on the Dreamcast, where Wallace will run through walls, curtains, chairs, and tables with nary an effect.  It's a crying shame seeing the broken (referred to by some as ~gimped~) animation of the main character and the enemy creatures especially after witnessing their wonderful design.  The production as a whole almost seems like an afterthought from the PlayStation version, like someone at Konami, Kalisto or Universal said ~Wow, that Dreamcast is selling well - quickly, recompile this thing for Dreamcast making use of these tools my friends at Bleem have developed for the upcoming Bleemcast.~  Not only is this a low point for Dreamcast graphics, but it feels like it was rushed out the door, what with the occasional freeze-ups and a few other presentation issues.  A Nightmare Creatures 2 cover that was more indicative of the game within would be a rough, half-finished, black and white sketch.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 13, 2000"}
