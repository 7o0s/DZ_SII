The first five questions are always dumb, the contestants talk too much, and Regis is annoying to the extreme. Even so, I have to admit that Who Wants To Be A Millionaire has quickly become one of my favorite shows on television. Everyone in the office feels just about the same way, for wildly varying differences. Steve likes the intellectual challenge of the later questions, Vincent likes the tension of the show, Tal likes the vicarious thrill of seeing someone actually holding cash. Me? I watch for people to blow their chances at winning a big pile of cash with the same enthusiasm that I used to watch the skier tumble down the face of the mountain at the beginning of the Wild World of Sports. No matter why each one of us watches the show though, we all think we'd be a hell of a lot better at it than the nimrods they seem to plop down in that seat each week. So when Disney finally sent us a copy of the new PC game based on the television show, we immediately began fighting for our chance at the big money. I won.  If you haven't ever seen the television show, don't worry  it takes about ten seconds to figure out. In short, Regis (that's Regis Philbin for those of you lucky enough to have missed daytime TV for the past few years) asks a series of fifteen questions, each worth an increasing amount of cash. If you get 'em all right, you win a million dollars. If you miss one, you don't. Let's move on to the more complex rules. Twice during your climb towards the big money - $1000 (the fifth question) and $32,000 (the tenth question), if you answer the question correctly, you'll be allowed to keep the money you've earned up until that point if you miss a question. Sadly, getting a check for a thousand bucks when you could have gotten one for a million probably isn't going to make that many people feel better. There's one other funky rule  during the course of the game you have access to three 'lifelines' that will give you a little help when you're having trouble. The first, 50-50, is pretty simple  it eliminates two of the four choices you have on the board. While it may seem like this would make things a lot easier, the computer is pretty adept at pulling the two choices that you weren't going to pick anyway. The second lifeline, ask the audience, is probably the most useful in the game. On the TV show, the audience all hit buttons in front of them indicating the answer that they think is correct. The player is then given the percentage totals of what was selected. In the video game it works pretty much the same, except that there's not really an audience (I hope). Instead, the designers conducted an Internet poll of 50 people for each question. Hopefully they're smarter than the average audience. The last choice, phone a friend, plays out a great deal differently than it does in the show. On TV, our heroes are given a chance to call anyone that they think might have the right answer to the question at hand. In the game, Regis calls up one of his friends. While I found this pretty annoying, I managed to fix the problem by allowing myself to ask a single friend what the answer to my question was if I used the lifeline. This worked pretty well until Steve threatened to kill me if I kept bugging him. Maybe I should move my desk.  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? the videogame plays (except for the differences noted above) almost exactly like the television show. Veteran quizmasters JellyVision have managed to impart the same fast paced feel and attitude that made their You Don't Know Jack series so popular while keeping the overall tension and feel of the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? TV show. Well, they almost managed to keep the same feel. The real problem with the game is that there aren't but a couple of hundred questions included. After ten plays, Steve and I started to notice repeat questions. After about twenty games, we knew most of the answers by heart. While this wouldn't really be a problem if you only played once a night, the real likelihood is that, like us, you're going to sit down and try to earn yourself a million dollars. After a couple of two-hour sessions, you'll have exhausted most of the questions available to you.  There's probably a good reason for this question shortfall. Each one of the questions has to have the appropriate data for all three lifelines, just in case someone tries to use them. This means that, instead of just needing a couple of K for each database entry, the game needs space for a Meg (I'm guessing here, of course) or so of voice files, percentage scores and 50-50 removal data. The obvious space hog here has to be the voice files and I wish that instead of trying to make the game more realistic by having each phone conversationalist ramble on for thirty to forty seconds about their home life, they had made the vocal answers more concise, leaving space for about two hundred more questions.  There are a few more annoying things about this game. While it's advertised on the box that you can play this game with, ~as many players as you can fit around the keyboard,~ this is really kind of misleading. As on the television show, multiple players are given a time sensitive question to answer. Whoever gets it right first gets to play the game. At this point, the other players are no longer involved (except for those who are standing behind you offering you help you don't want - thanks Jane). I feel like the publishers could have been a little more clear about this on the box. Second, although the game's intro and animations are excellent, there's no real way to skip past them. After my fifth or sixth time playing this game, waiting for it to finish up got pretty annoying.  In the end, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is a fantastic game that will entertain the hell out of the entire family for about four hours. If it's worth the purchase price to you to get the whole family gathered around for a quick break during the holidays, then by all means, go out and pick up this excellent product. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a title that will keep you entertained for more than a handful of play sessions, wait for the next version of You Don't Know Jack instead.  -- Trent C.
