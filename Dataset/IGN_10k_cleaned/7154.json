Everything's here: top-notch graphics, good control and playability, and amazing music. And when you consider that this was essentially a last-minute rush job, with Namco given just six months to learn the then new PSX hardware and complete the arcade conversion, they really did do a superb job.  You know the score: you race one of 13 cars around a nicely detailed track towards ultimate fame and glory (or something like that). All of the original arcade elements are here, including the integral, and now famous, power slide. There are a few surprises as well, including the bonus reverse tracks, and the ability to crash into the helicopter! Right fun!  However, it's not all sweetness and light. There's no two-player mode, and everyone knows there's nothing more fun in a racing game than driving against your friends. Also, the cars don't really vary in performance that much. Most are just middle of the road, with the exception of the fast yellow car. Power slides a-plenty! Overall, though, Ridge Racer has definitely stood the test of time. Think about it: Ridge Racer is almost two years old. And in videogame years, that's a lifetime.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
