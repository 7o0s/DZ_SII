While not very different from either game, what HSX does have to set itself apart from the other games (besides its low $9.99 pricetag) is an easy-to-use track editor.  Sure, other games have editors (including F-Zero), but few have been as accessible as the one found in HSX.  So, a great track editor is great, but how is the rest of the game?  Keep reading.  Gameplay This is a game you've seen before.  Maybe many times so.  You pilot a sleek, jet-propelled vehicle that hovers above track while competing against other opponents for first place; nothing new here.  HSX is more along the lines of say F-Zero in that there are no real weapons, and there are also paths along the track that you can drive through to power-up your shields.    In the way of racing modes, there is the Cup race and Time Trial races.  The Cup races are your standard race-against-the-others races.  There's not much to think about during these competitions.  Go forward, and go fast.  There aren't any weapons to use, there are no speed pads on the tracks, and the other opponents aren't too aggressive.  The only real button besides the gas you have to worry about is the boost button.  You pick up boost icons that will, er, boost your boost meter (say that ten times fast).  Using your boost becomes a necessity many times during a race because the CPU-controlled opponents rarely let up on the gas.    Even though the other racers are fast, they are rarely aggressive.  They mainly get ahead of you because they seem unfairly faster, not because they're a better racer than you.  But in all honesty, I found myself rarely thinking about the other opponents.  My concentration was focused on getting to the end of the track more than anything else, and this led to my placing in the top three or four each time.  It's almost as if the other racers aren't there.  You could say they're more like background noise than anything else.      I've never piloted a hovering jet-car before, but controlling one in HSX felt pretty good.  The control is tight and responsive, and it has that arcade feel to them.  The rest of the physics in the game also feel a little arcadey, but it works well in the game.  There's really very little of a learning curve.  By the time you finish your first race, you should have a good feel for the game.  This is good since anyone can pick up a controller and play, but it also makes the game feel very, very shallow.  Every future racer needs some wild track designs, and HSX does have its share of moments, but they are too far and few.  Corkscrews, near-vertical climbs, and big jumps are everywhere, but they feel dated and rehashed, rather than fresh and exhilarating -- we did see this sort of thing years ago.  Also, when making the jumps across the huge gaps, something feels off.  You get the feeling that you're not going to make a jump, and then all of the sudden your vehicle boosts forward the rest of the way.  It makes jumping the tracks easier, but provides little challenge for the player to gain the appropriate amount of speed.  Now let's talk about the track editor.  Usually, I don't care too much for making my own tracks, skateparks, whatever.  The process is often tedious and confusing, but in HSX, it's a breeze to get a basic track up and going.  You start off by selecting a location somewhere in the world (labeled through longitude and latitude points) to build your masterpiece at.  Then you take control of a small piece of track.  Using the left analog stick (or shoulder buttons), you can adjust the direction and bank angle of the next increment of road.  Place it, then repeat.  Because the tracks in the game are pretty much bare, with the only real variation being the twists and turns, all you really have to do to build a track is aim with the analog stick and press X.  You can also hold it down and guide the real-time creation of your track in one fluid motion.  Afterwards, you can set the beginning point and race your track.  That's it.  Simple and intuitive.    What's not so great about the track editor is that, sure, you can make twisty, curvy roads that extend into the sky, but that's about it.  There's just not much else to keep you interested for very long after you've made your first 3 or 4 wild tracks.  I guess this is inevitable considering the basic structure of the tracks in the game.  Like the controls, anyone can pick up a controller and use the editor, but there's only so much you can do with it.  It's often hard to find a balance of user ease and complexity, and HSX proves that.    Graphics Here we have a game that undoubtedly draws its visual inspiration from other futuristic racing, most notably F-Zero and Wipeout.  You've got your desolate future cities that, oddly enough, seem to be uninhabited; there's the pod-shaped ~cars~ that magically hover above the track; then you've got the loopy tracks that go every which way.  Just about everything in HSX is borrowed from one game or another.  Whether this is a good or bad thing is really up to your own personal taste.  So now that we know the general look and feel of the game, it's worth mentioning that HSX fails to pull off the style with as much polish or technical merits as the games it borrows from does.  Upon first looking at the game, things look pretty good; the game moves fast and there are a lot of flashing lights and particle effects onscreen.  Your first impression will be that the game looks just as good as any other futuristic racer.  But then you slow down and take a closer look.  Some bad textures and, at times, some very simplistic roadside models make HSX look like a PS1 game.  Just take a look at the static, single-layer water texture on the tracks.  It looks like some sky blue paint was smudged on the road, yet when you drive through it, water particles cover your screen.  And speaking of the water particles, I'm sure most of you are familiar with the ~water-on-the-screen~ effect found in many games today.  Well, HSX also has the effect, but the implementation is almost laughable.  Rather than having pseudo-realistic water droplets cover the screen and react in a natural way to your speed and direction, these plastic-looking bubbles suddenly appear onscreen and either move to the left and up before disappearing (this happens when it rains), even when stationary, or they all contract in place and vanish -- a completely unrealistic implementation.  More time should have been spent creating a more believable effect, because as is, it looks more like a cheap hack.  Not everything is that bad though.  As mentioned earlier, the framerate is relatively quick, though it definitely chops up in certain areas.  Also, the car models are decent if a bit utilitarian in look.  What this all boils down to is a pretty plain looking game that does nothing new, and in some cases worse than its predecessors.  Blah.   Sound With any futuristic racer comes the obligatory electronic music.  Games like Wipeout used some great licensed electronic music from established name, while other games would use original electronic tracks that varied in quality from excellent to atrocious.  Unfortunately, the music in HSX leans towards the latter.  Get ready for your ears to be bombarded with sounds pulled from the CD beside you labeled ~Electronic Music.~    Sound effects don't fare much better.  The roar of your jets sounds incredibly muffled, with no depth or detail, and other sounds, like when you boost or pick up power-ups are just as bad.  They sound like they were pulled from the CD labeled ~Racing Game Sounds,~ lying next to the electronic music one.  There's very little that is redeeming about the sound in HSX.  Too bad. HSX feels like a cheap game.  Y'know, the kind you find for bargain fare at your local super-mart.  And why shouldn't it?  The game's MSRP is only $9.99!  At this price, you can afford to pick up the game just for fun.  If you don't like it, no big loss.  It'll still make a great stocking stuffer for your younger sibling.If you're going to compete in this genre of games, you definitely have to go all out and not hold back.  Luckily, HSX is aimed as a budget title, so it's not really competing in the same class of games anyways.The game's best feature is its track editor.  It's a lot of fun making some really crazy tracks that no one in their right mind could or would race on, but after that's done, the fun ends.  The editor, and just about every other aspect of the game needs to be fleshed out a lot more to be a worthwhile game.  But hey, it's still only $9.99!", "date": "Jan 28, 2003"}
