Measured against Warcraft and Middle Earth the fantasy world of Eberron provides as attractive a setting for a fantasy strategy game. But rather than simply using the Eberron setting to create a straightforward RTS, the gang at Liquid have also added numerous RPG-like mechanics to help bring a little more variety to the experience.   Before we go any further though we should qualify Dragonshard's claim to be the ~first D&D RTS experience.~ While that's a powerful marketing message, its validity depends on how you define D&D. For some people, D&D is all about the mechanics: base-attack bonuses, will saves, spell memorization, etc. For others D&D is about the content: beholders, paladins, dungeon traps, etc. The truth is that D&D is made up of a mix of both of these elements. (For me personally, the rules are probably more important to the brand than the campaign setting. A Conan game run with D&D rules seems more like D&D to me than a Forgotten Realms game run with Hero system or GURPS rules, for instance.)   That said, Dragonshard reflects the content of the D&D world rather than the core rules. As such, it would be better marketed just as an Eberron game than a D&D game. Unfortunately, the new Eberron setting just doesn't have the draw that Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk have, so it makes more sense just to put D&D on the box and leave it at that. I don't mean to dwell on this point too much but, as a fan and player of the pen and paper game, the distinction between an RTS based on the D&D mechanics and one simply based in the new campaign setting is worth noting.  Rather than adapting the full range of 3.5E rules, Dragonshard merely merges the basic concepts of classes, experience levels and dungeon crawling to a more traditional RTS format. On the upper world players will have to create massive armies and lead them against enemy strongholds. Gateways to the lower world will allow players to lead parties of adventurers into battle against a wide variety of monsters proctecting gold and magic items.  Dragonshard captures the spirit of the Eberron campaign setting. The locales, races and overall backstory of the game fits well with the details found in the source books. Considering that Dragonshard was written by Eberron's creator Keith Baker, it's no surprise that it feels authentic at every level. The main features of Eberron -- dragon shards, warforged golems, scary lizards, etc -- are all out in force here. I will admit being disappointed in not being able to field massive armies of dinosaur riding halfing barbarians but I suppose you can't have everything.  Eberron was created out of the bodies of three warring dragons. While two of the dragons became the world itself, a third dragon took the form of a massive ring of crystals orbiting the world. These magical crystals sometimes plummet to earth where the peoples of Eberron to fight to gain ownership of them. In addition to the humans, dwarves, dark elves and the usual suspects of the fantasy milieu, Eberron also features wood and metal constructs known as warforged. Originally created as mindless warriors, they've since achieved sentience and taken charge of their own destiny.  Players take charge of one of two factions in Dragonshard - the valiant Order of the Flame and the tail-lashing Lizardfolk. Both forces are competing to gain control of a massive magical shard, the coveted Heart of Siberys. The Umbragen represent a third faction (playable only in multiplayer and skirmish modes) that stands in opposition against both player factions. Each faction has about a dozen units it can field and four different unique hero characters who can impart profound bonuses on their entire army.      The Order of Flame is your typical goody-two-shoes affair, made up of human paladins, dwarven warriors and halfling rogues, all of whom would love nothing more than to bring peace and harmony to the creatures of the world -- and they're not above busting some heads to make it happen. The Lizardfolk are a bunch of lizardmen, yuan-tis and troglodytes who have been mutated by the Heart of Siberys and are now racing the Order of Flame to gain ownership of the massive shard. Finally, the Umbragen are the remnants of dark elves, undead and the occasional mind flayer who have recently emerged from the lower worlds to shatter the Heart and absorb its power.   Though there aren't many missions here, there are plenty of optional quests everywhere you turn. There are even some choices to make in terms of who you help. You may get hold of a powerful magic item or a huge quantity of gold and be forced to consider whether or not to keep it or to turn it over to its rightful owner in hopes of some sort of reward. In either case, there's usually a compelling reason to go in each direction.  There are also compelling reasons to play both above and below ground. Each area has one of the two resources you'll need to drive your economy. Above ground you'll be able to collect the shards that fall from the sky. You'll have to venture below ground to obtain the gold. This precious resource trickles in at a very slow rate but in order to really kick your war machine into action, you'll need to head downstairs and loot cold, hard cash from monsters and chests. Since each building and unit requires an outlay of both gold and shards, players who focus only on one of these resources will soon find their strategy failing apart.  The third resource you'll have to manage is experience. As each unit takes part in battle, it contributes to a large common experience pool. You can spend experience points back at your home base to upgrade your units. Rather than picking specific upgrades for your units, they'll gain pre-determined upgrades at each new level. Each new level permits your units to recruit an extra henchman to aid them in battle. These henchmen become very important when fighting above ground because they don't count against your population limit. The only downside is that they can't venture into the underground areas to help out the rest of your heroes.  One thing that's really missing from Dragonshard is the concept of persistent characters. All the time and attention you spent building up your characters' abilities and equipment all amounts to basically nothing once the next mission starts. While the clean slate approach certainly helps balance the game, it fails to create the kind of investment in your character that you might find in more traditional roleplaying games.  To compensate for this, you'll find that you can buy new items and abilities for your main heroes in between missions. Using reward points, you can boost a hero's attacks, regeneration rates or a variety of other abilities. This aspect of the game definitely helps to build a sense of continuity as you move from mission to mission. Still, given the possibilities inherent in the D&D license, I kind of expected a little bit more flexibility in terms of upgrades.  In terms of upgrades, base construction offers one of the cooler innovations in Dragonshard. To begin with, each base, referred to as a nexus, can contain a limited number of buildings arranged in grids. Since there's a space limitation you'll need to choose your structures carefully. Making matters more complicated, you'll need to place multiple versions of the same building next to each other if you want to be able to advance the units they produce to higher levels. In other words, a lone Lorehold can be upgraded to produce level two clerics. To get to level three clerics, you'll have to build two Loreholds next to each other.      There are also additional bonus buildings, called Monuments, that will augment units produced in nearby buildings. Monuments of Vitality, for instance, will give units produced at nearby buildings a health bonus. Each of the three sides also has a unique monument that strengthens their basic style of play. The Umbragen monument gives units an invisibility bonus while the Order of the Flame monument lets you produce units faster.  While the monuments and the level requirements allow for some neat building strategies, I wish that more had been done here. When we saw the game over a year ago, the idea seemed to be that all of the buildings would affect the surrounding buildings. Clerics produced at a temple, for instance, could get higher defense if built next to a blacksmith or higher mana if built next to a building that produces wizards. Though the idea might be a little more unwieldy, it would definitely increase the extent to which you could customize your forces.   Unfortunately, Dragonshard falls a bit short in terms of length. With only two campaigns of seven missions each, most gamers will run through the single player content in a couple of days. Originally the game was supposed to feature four different factions, each with their own campaign. During development one entire faction was scrapped completely and the third had their campaign ripped out from under them. So now we're left with campaigns for just the Order of the Flame and the Lizardfolk. You still have a chance to play as the Umbragen but you'll have to get up to speed with them in skirmish mode or just take your chances online.  Happily, the game's longevity is helped somewhat by the skirmish and multiplayer modes. Not surprisingly, you'll find it much easier to manage to trigger-driven AI of the single player game than the unpredictable, adaptable mind of a human opponent. The wide variety of options in the skirmish and multiplayer will maintain your interest for a long while. Obviously, destroying your enemy and his structures will do the job nicely, but you can also compete for ownership of expansion bases, places of power or simply race to collect as many magical artifacts as you can find.  I liked the art style of Battle Realms a lot better but the graphics in Dragonshard are still very good. Since it's based on D&D, the touchstone for most fantasy games, the visuals look slightly generic. Though it's hard to say something new with the requisite knights, vampires, and company, Dragonshard manages to run through the gamut of fantasy cliches without making them seem like cliches. The real visual feast is found in the underground areas of the game. The range of details is impressive, from the skeletons of fallen adventurers to massive, frescoed columns.  The sounds in Dragonshard are a little better than average. While the cacophony of battle is suitably convincing, I could have done with a little more realism in terms of the voices. As it is, the caricatured voice work tends to give the game a bit of a cartoon quality that undercuts the rest of the experience somewhat. Theres a lot to like about Dragonshard, particularly so since were not seeing any more Lord of the Rings RTS games. I really like the way theyve introduced some RPG concepts into the genre. Sure, they could have done more to increase the significance of character advancement and they could have stuck a little closer to actual mechanics of D&D but the basic experience of the game is quite enjoyable.Though other games have managed to work in a multi-layered battlefield, Dragonshards approach makes each layer meaningful in an entirely unique way. Sending heroes down below to negotiate traps, battle huge monsters or collect loot  is as important and exciting as building vast armies, securing shards and taking the fight to the enemys base. And its just as fun too.", "date": "Sep 23, 2005"}
