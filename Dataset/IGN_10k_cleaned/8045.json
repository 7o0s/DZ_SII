Well, actually, no it doesn't, but since IGN AU is coming last to the party, after both the US and UK reviews (super-sloppy-thirds, I believe it's known as), we need to have some point of difference, and it looks like starting out with a grossly inaccurate translation is it.   We jest, but the reality is that there's been a huge amount of discussion about this game already on the interweb. Hell, IGN even gave Okami its coveted 'Game of 2006' award. What's left to talk about? Thankfully plenty, as Okami is probably the greatest action RPG to be released on PS2. This is a game that cries out to be played by every Australian gamer - hence another review - and is a true rival to the likes of Zelda.   In fact, while Okami takes many of its cues from Nintendo's legendary series, the difference is that when Zelda fans go into a new game, they know that they'll encounter many of the same core gameplay mechanics that have become hallmarks of the series. That's not a bad thing - the Zelda games are masterfully designed after all, but Okami is a whole new beast. It hits the ground running with refreshing and inventive concepts, effortlessly sweeping the player into a figuratively amorous embrace with its world.   What strikes us most about Okami is that Clover Studio has created a world where every aspect of its design resonates with every other aspect. Okami isn't just about a unique look - while the visual style is heavily inspired by traditional Japanese art, culture, folklore and mythology, so too is every other aspect. These influences are used to serve the story, to ground the soundtrack, and are tightly integrated into the design of the gameplay. This is a textured world, with multiple layers of tightly woven game design fabric moving as one, and it's nothing short of intoxicating - whether you have any knowledge of Japanese culture or not.   The world's best gardening sim, hands down.  Okami opens with a long series of minimally animated, gorgeously drawn cutscenes that tell the story of an eight headed serpent named Orochi, the terror of Kamiki Village for an age, who was eventually slain by Nagi the warrior, and Shiranui the white wolf. Peace settled upon the land for 100 years, but now a great darkness has once again surfaced, and a white wolf - the living embodiment of the sun god Amaterasu, must come to the rescue.    Okami starts the player off in Kamiki Village, and doesn't waste much time introducing one of the central tenets of the game - restoring life to the world. Okami is very much a game about contrasts - dead and alive, monochrome and colour. Each new area you come to will be afflicted by nasty grey zones pulsing with crimson rimmed black fog, with any inhabitants frozen like statues. To bring the area back to life, the player will need to find the nearby Guardian Sapling, and use the Celestial Brush to bring it back to life, causing a chain reaction of blooming life that bursts and streams through the world.   What's the Celestial Brush? I'm glad you asked and have somehow managed to avoid learning anything about Okami elsewhere. The Celestial Brush is one of Amaterasu's most important tools in the game. Hit the R1 trigger at any time and you enter into a monochromatic, frozen depiction of the scene. One analogue stick allows you to pan the camera around (which can be useful to get a better angle, or to move around an enemy during a battle to attack from behind), while the other allows you to literally draw on screen. Drawing a circle over a Guardian Sapling, for instance, brings it back into bloom, and the Celestial Brush techniques are integrated into every aspect of the game.   As you progress you'll learn new techniques (there are fifteen in all), putting a feeling of incredible power at your fingertips. Among other things, the Celestial Brush can be used to slash at enemies or cut down greenery, to grow trees, to create bombs, to draw in lily pads on water, to repair damaged bridges or paths, to draw the sun into the sky and to grapple using Konohana Blossoms. There are other, more whimsical uses for it too. Draw a Bloom circle around an NPC and they'll come over and give Amaterasu a pat, or slash at some candles to extinguish their flame, leaving anyone in the area puzzling over what just happened.   The Bud Ogre. Weird, we know a guy who calls himself that.  The Celestial Brush is a powerful tool that's integrated into everything from the most minor puzzles, through to epic, world-changing events, and from confrontations with the most cursory of enemies through to full scale boss battles. Amaterasu is hardly a one-trick-pony (or one-brush-wolf), however. He moves with glorious agility, wall-jumping up to high ledges, leaping across gaps with grace, digging into the earth to find hidden objects, and unleashing combo attacks during fights. Amaterasu can have two Divine Instruments equipped at any time as well. You start the game with Divine Retribution (which is the reflector on his back wreathed in flames that you'd be familiar with from most of the artwork) but will soon pick up more, each of which has different attributes depending on whether you equip it as the main weapon or sub.    The Divine Instruments really come into play during battles, which can be initiated by coming into contact with the Demonic Scrolls moving about the landscape. Doing so will make a sectioned-off area appear, rimmed by kanji characters rising up like ominous red flames. Enemies will appear, often slap their butts at you (no, really), and you'll proceed to slap them silly in return with claws or rosary, before switching to the Celestial Brush to finish them off. It must be said that these battles are rarely all that challenging, but the mythological apparitions you'll face are very cool nonetheless. Blue Imps, for instance, glide about attached to a kite ~tossing insults and rude language~ according to the bestiary, while the Crow Tengu is an unholy amalgamation of a crow with the soul of a samurai, so it strikes with speed and artistry. Other enemies play instruments, from flutes and lutes to big booming drums, which helps give battles the air of a strange demonic festival. Each creature that you face off against is added to the bestiary in the pause menu, complete with a gorgeous traditional portrait by Issun, and a short, often pithy description.   Speaking of Issun, he's your pint-sized companion for the journey, a wandering artist with more than a passing interest in learning the Celestial Brush techniques. Every game needs a wise cracking, hot headed sidekick, and fortunately Issun is genuinely entertaining; a good counterpoint to the ~furball~. While Amaterasu doesn't speak, he's certainly not the typical stoic hero type either, with plenty of personality expressed in his animations and quizzical reactions to events.   Seriously, every modern game fits dual wielding in somewhere.  In fact, Okami is packed with great characters. There's Mr Orange, the dancing elder of Kamiki Village, who has an orange balanced on top of his head which bounces as he speaks, and who lives in a house adorned with a giant orange on its roof. There's Onigiri Sensei, the owner of the dojo, who seems like a feeble old man at first, but becomes a warrior once you commission him to teach you a new technique. His head spins around on his neck, winding up upside down, transforming what was once an old man's beard and moustache into a snarling set of thick eyebrows. And then there's Waka the arrogant prophet/swordsman who swoops in to insult and then challenge you throughout the course of the game, sporting a lightsaber-style sword, effeminate looks and affected French expressions, such as ~Au revoir, baby~.   Of course, the characters (and narrative for that matter) wouldn't be half as good without such a brilliant translation from the original Japanese script. This is hands-down one of the best localisations we've had the pleasure of experiencing in ages. It hits all the right notes, with the right blend of humour, slang and gravitas. The team have also demonstrated a deft eye for knowing what to change and what to leave. Would most gamers know what ~onigiri~ means? Maybe not, but they left it in, along with a whole heap of other Japanese names and references, all of which add to the tone of the game, whether you understand them or not. Nice one.   Visuals so good you'll have a half husky to go with your wolf.  All this adds up to a world that you'll relish exploring, and believe us when we say - in addition to the epic main quest, there's a huge amount of other stuff to do. Let's see, there's fishing, feeding animals, killing monsters on Mika's wanted list (all of which have great names like ~Toya of the Short Temper~), trading Demon Fangs, finding and restoring all the four leafed clovers (with sound effects straight from the Clover Studio intro), collecting the 99 Stray Beads and more. Many of these activities will net you Praise (the game's EXP) which can be used to upgrade your Solar Energy, Ink Pot, Astral Pouch and Purse.    With all that out of the way, it's time to finally talk about the visuals. Screenshots simply can't do this game justice - it's gorgeous in a way that no other PS2 game has come close to matching. The entire game looks like it has been hand drawn on thick paper - the sky, the rocks and even Amaterasu's coat all have a coarse, paper texture quality, while wind swirls through the air like strokes from a brush and mountains in the background are little more than sketches. Amaterasu is wonderfully animated, too. A wellspring of life springs from his paws, leaving a trail of blooming flowers and grass behind him as he runs, autumn leaves wafting down as he dashes through the air, and lily pads floating behind him as he swims.Okami is a triumphant melding of great game design and hand-drawn aesthetics that successfully captures a mythical vision of Japan, where gods and demons are ever present aspects of life. While there are some minor annoyances  the camera movement can be a bit sluggish, particularly in battles for instance, as a whole this game is one of the highlights of the PS2s extensive catalogue.", "date": "Feb 14, 2007"}
