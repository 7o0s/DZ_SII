It's a top-down action RPG with plenty of fast paced button mashing, inventory management and character development just like we saw in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. And, like the title implies, it's even set in the same Dungeons & Dragons universe as Vivendi Universal's Baldur's Gate franchise. So what's a confused Xbox owner to do to distinguish one from the other? Simple, think of all the improvements you would've liked to have seen in BGDA and gauge whether you want to wait for the sequel --coming later this year-- or if you need your role-playing action now.   Gameplay  Whether you're playing alone or with up to three friends, you're one of four heroes brought back after 150 years to defeat a great evil that's threatening the world as we know it. You can rename your Fighter, Wizard, Cleric and Rogue characters and you will have to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each if you want to be successful. The first area where D&D makes a departure from the standards set in BGDA is in the control system. Beyond your basic melee attack button you will have customizable attacks on the other three face buttons of your controller. By pulling the left trigger you can slow down time (for all characters if you're in multiplayer) and use the D-pad to navigate through a customization mini-menu that pops up. It's here that you can assign the dozens and dozens of attacks, spells, finishing moves and other special abilities, so you're never more than a few button presses away from having just what you need to whoop ass.  This element of the control system is brilliantly implemented because as your character develops and acquires more specialties like venom arrows or fireball spitting staffs, you'll be able to easily manage your inventory on the fly without pausing the game. When playing with four players, the only drawback is all of the other players are in slo-mo as well, while you're looking for that perfect spell to demolish that giant dragon. Playing slower for a few seconds is a lot better than everybody having to pause to get new stuff. And you'll notice that we said finishers are among the special abilities you can map to your controller. The developers at Atari have built a system where after a successful sequence of basic melee attacks you'll be able to throw a devastating finishing move against any enemy in the area, even one you weren't melee attacking.     The net effect of all this control you'll have is that you'll be able to keep the game relatively fresh for yourself. The main challenge in this game, like in other games in this genre, is managing the different types of enemies being thrown at you and their vulnerabilities, all in the heat of a battle. You know shield wielding orcs are tough against melee attacks but vulnerable to most spell types. Quickly shifting to an area effect spell or a fire bomb attack is a piece of cake and your ability to read, recognize and respond to different threats and groups of threats will determine your satisfaction with D&D Heroes. It looks like something you've played before, but just under the surface you'll appreciate the differences. Multiply that times the number of players you've got playing with you and you could have a lot of fun in your hands.       You have your basic shopping and inventory system in place where the game will pause so you can buy new gear, equip new armor and handheld weapons and what not. You have the same weight limits on your character's carrying capacity that we saw in Baldur's Gate. You'll also see a version of that game's upgrade menu where you can boost your basic abilities from the D&D universe like strength and dexterity as well as character specific abilities like the Fighter's War Cry. These are the abilities that you will gain along the way that can be mapped to your face button. In this case, the War Cry stuns nearby enemies.  One other bit we loved was the Ancestral Weapon. Your character's default weapon isn't just what he or she gets because of their character class. It's automatically upgraded throughout the game and can never be sold or left behind for any reason. By the time you're late in the game, it should be the most powerful weapon in your arsenal to make up for the fact that you never bought or found a +5 fire sword or the +3 dagger. This is a very nice system for novices and veterans alike since you'll always get the sense of accomplishment you want but without being forced to make too many tough decisions about what to keep and what to sell/drop.  Strategy Guide Available! Slay the dragon, beat the dungeon! Can't fell the orcs? Lost in the forest? Or maybe you just need some cheats... IGN Guides can help. We've crafted the finest strategy guide from enchanted leather and elven metals. Well, really just words. But words of power! Get The Guide | See Other Guides  Graphics  Besides some occasional sluggishness here and there, D&D looks great and moves very well. Lots of enemies on screen, extra human players and too many flamboyant spells cast can all do horrible things to the game's framerate and this has to be considered a disappointment.  Beyond this, however, there's a lot of good looking lighting and other cool effects scattered throughout the game. Shooting arrows will lodge them in both enemies and in the wall when you miss. Heat effects rise from flickering torches that cast nice soft glows over everything nearby.   The animation on the characters isn't too fancy and they definitely get repetitive. The special moves, finishers and spells spread across four characters however does add up to plenty of different animations, just nothing that looks particularly outstanding. This goes for the enemies as well. You'll get basic enemy deaths and bad guys getting chopped into bloody pieces sometimes. It's easy to separate the badasses from the nonbadasses by the way they look and the attacks they make on you, but the way they move isn't too impressive.     Sound  There's not much to listen to during most of the gameplay besides a little music and the grunting and sounds of battling heroes. The musical score is well done and very appropriate for the D&D theme of the game. Lots of horns and chanting and stuff like that really makes you want to head to the nearest dungeon and slay a dragon.  The implementation of 5.1 Surround Sound is well done so you get great echo effects and advanced notice on enemies sneaking up on you. During the cutscenes there's some high drama and it all sounds great as well. A little bit more from the characters would've been nice, but for this type of game it's usually optional. We all loved Gauntlet in the arcade and D&D Heroes captures the adventure-filled essence of that classic but with a very clever new control system that can be enhanced and refined in all sorts of interesting ways. It's exclusive to Xbox as well, so it can be a good game to expand your offline multiplayer library.Considering Baldur's Gate on Xbox was a straight port, this is the first new game in the genre available on Xbox and it's just a whole lot of fun when you get a good multiplayer session going. The ability for players to hop in and hop out and any point and pick up the adventure at any point makes D&D super accessible. Waiting for Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 2 might be the way to go for fans of the franchise, but D&D Heroes is a lot of fun right now.", "date": "Sep 20, 2003"}
