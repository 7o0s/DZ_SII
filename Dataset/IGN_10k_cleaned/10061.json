{"name": "N+", "name_review": "N+ Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/22/n-review-3", "text": "Since the release of the 1985 film American Ninja, the world has been operating under the false assumption that the greatest threat a ninja can face is Michael Dudikoff. So for the past few years the small, independent game developer Metanet has been trying to set the record straight.   Although The Dude-ikoff is a formidable foe, Metanet presents the contrarian view that true ninja must overcome a far more powerful force: physics. Oh, and he'll also need to collect a lotta gold.   Metanet's radical ninja theory was first presented in a free PC Flash game called N in 2005, and the popular platformer is now available in a beefed-up form with all new levels called N+ on Xbox Live Arcade. Whether you're new to the N idea or are an old hand at the original, N+ is well worth your attention and is a welcome addition to Xbox Live.   N+ is a platformer in its purest form. There are two actions: move and jump. There's no story, save for the following: ~Like all ninjas, you have an unquenchable thirst for gold, a natural propensity for exploring rooms infested by lethal ninja-killing robots, and a devout belief in N.~    You better run.   N is the way of the ninja, which means using the game's physics system to your advantage and avoiding its sharp, painful bite. Master jumping, sliding and floating to reach your goals and avoid mechanized lasers and their ilk. Lose your touch even for a split-second, and you'll end up in a million particle-effected bits on the game's signature gray floor.   The controls in N+ are simple but nuanced. Although your only actions are running and jumping, you're in control of what happens from there. Tap the jump button for a short hop, or hold it down for more air. Grabbing walls on the way down will slow your descent. It's a move you'll use often throughout the 250 levels in N+.     Jump trajectory can be altered in mid-air, and the effects of running, walking and sliding are all affected by velocity. The result is a deceptively simple control scheme with near-infinite movement possibilities.   You'll have to master them all as you make your way through the N+ episodes, most of which are devilishly constructed. The object of every N+ episode is to make your way through the level to find a key and then use it to open a locked exit door. Tutorial levels aside, it's rarely a simple endeavor, and there are obstacles, enemies and puzzling predicaments aplenty along the way.    Bounce blocks can either help or hurt your efforts, robotic rocket launchers and lasers hunt you down, mines explosively block your way and secondary doors can make things downright nerve-wracking. As if all that weren't enough, each episode has a time limit, and you can only extend it by picking up gold pieces scattered throughout the stage.    Al least it will be an honorable death.   It's hard to pin a length on N+. Some levels will literally take you 10 seconds to complete, and some will have you locked to your TV screen for 30 minutes. In some levels, N+ embraces the storied platforming tradition of trial and error (you might not even know the right sequence of jumps until your fifth try). Other levels are more puzzle-based or speed-based, and the developers did a great job of pacing the game so that the most brain-bending episodes are bookended by breathers.   With that said, expect to die a lot in N+. There's an achievement for dying 1,000 times, if that tells you anything. The load times between deaths are nearly non-existent, and because the episodes are each confined to one screen you'll feel compelled to try particularly tough stages over and over again until you get it right.   N+ manages to be a picture of platforming purity without taking itself too seriously. Each episode name is funnier that the one before, and most contain pop culture references, gaming in-jokes and self-deprecating humor. Some of my favorites include: Jump at the Gold 2: Slope to Wall, One Jump to Rule Them All and Things That Make You Go Boom.    The music has a smooth, snappy elecro feel that keeps the game's momentum going without becoming grating or distracting  quite a feat in a game with so many levels and so many after-death reloads.   In addition to its addictive gameplay, creative levels, great humor and sexy soundtrack, N+ has a clean, modern look that's easy on the eyes. It's not a flashy game, but the developers have bumped it up from its Flash roots, adding particle effects, an independently scrolling background and an all-around sharper look.   In addition to its single-player mode, N+ includes both online and offline co-op and competitive race and survival multiplayer modes. Both are fun, but one of my gripes about N+ is magnified in the multiplayer modes.   N was designed for a small Flash window, and N+ retains some of that small-screen feel. At times, I wished my ninja was a bit bigger, as much of my widescreen TV's real estate was often filled with non-playable gray background. The problem is multiplied during multiplayer matches. With two players on-screen, the game stretches the view to accommodate both, and your little ninja can become even more miniscule.    Frustratingly, in the co-op mode, if your partner dies, the screen will keep his body in view rather than snapping back to a tighter view of your still-alive character, making it difficult to navigate the remainder of the level.   There's a level editor in N+ too, and I found it surprisingly easy and fun to use. From what I can tell, you won't be able to share your creations with other players over Xbox Live, however, likely to prevent people from making levels shaped like genitals.  Metanet's Flash-based ninja game transitioned well to Xbox Live Arcade and is well worth a download if you're yearning for a pure platformer. Sure, you can download its predecessor for free on your PC, but with more levels, console controls and a bumped-up look, N+ feels like a new experience.", "date": "Feb 22, 2008"}
