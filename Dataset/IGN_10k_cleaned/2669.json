Released as an add-on for The Age of Kings, it added tons of new units, loads of new campaigns and some thoughtful rebalancing to the existing game. I remarked at one point that Galactic Battlegrounds, based off of Age of Kings, seemed like little more than a Star Wars themed expansion pack. Not that that's a bad thing; I loved Age of Kings and I loved Star Wars. But now, concurrent with the release of the film, LucasArts has released the first expansion to Galactic Battlegrounds, The Clone Campaigns.  Like the new film, the game adds two new political factions to the Star Wars universe: the Confederacy of Independent Planets and the Galactic Republic. While both are centered primarily on the use of troopers and mechs, there's more than enough variety between the two sides, both of a practical and philosophical nature. The Confederacy workers, for instance, are upgraded with basic training automatically, making them more robust. The Galactic Republic doesn't have the same worker advantages but they do get cheaper air units and a reduced cost for mech upgrades.  Each of the two sides has a unique campaign, seven missions for the Confederacy, six for the Galactic Empire. Since they attempt to tell a single story, you've got to play them in order, beginning with the Confederacy. As in the previous game, the action within the missions doesn't overlap the action of the movie but rather supplements it by focusing on some of the side stories on the periphery of the film. It's a good approach that keeps things fresh while also giving you some ground to stand on.  While hardly surprising, it's significant that the game gives you a ~good guy~ and ~bad guy~ oriented campaign (although truth be told, both sides and their respective heroes seem kind of bad). I won't spoil the surprises by revealing any of the specifics of the missions but you get to meet up with a few of the characters from the film, visit a few of the locations (although under different circumstances) and see some of the action that took place behind the scenes of the movie. Once you're done with the campaigns, there's a single bonus mission that you can play. I won't spoil it either but simply say that it takes place right after Return of the Jedi and gives you access to a really cool unit.  Unfortunately the two campaigns are told too differently. In the first campaign you take on the role of Sev'Rance Tann and operate under the direction of Count Dooku. All the mission briefings are handled in the present tense and Count Dooku speaks directly to you in person: ~You need to go do this...~ While the second campaign has you take charge of jedi Echuu Shen-Jon, all the briefings are handled in the past tense. Mace Windu tells the story of Echuu to you as if you're not Echuu. It may be more effective from a story-telling standpoint but it's kind of an abrupt change after the immediacy of the previous campaign. On the same level, the fact that you don't control a main character from the film (like Chewbacca or Darth Vader in the previous game) is kind of a letdown.  The two new civilizations and the six existing ones all also gain special team bonuses that take effect when they ally with another civilization. The Confederacy and their allies receive a nova collection bonus while the Galactic Empire's allies benefit from increased mech movement. The Republic offers more effective healer units and faster jedis. Beyond these benefits, each side also gets a unique fortress bonus. The Rebel fortress has a longer range and wider sight radius while the Republic fortress offers garrisoned units a higher rate of healing. These benefits are a nice way to further differentiate the sides but they don't really start to shine until you start playing multiplayer.  All civilizations share two new units. The first available is the Power Droid. These little guys are absolutely fantastic and, trivial as they may seem at first, they might be the neatest addition to the game. They act as mobile power generators and you can use them to set up remote satellite bases in key strategic locations. I've used them countless times to supplement (and in a few cases completely replace) my existing power generators. The downside of course is that they're more vulnerable to attack.  At the other end of the spectrum lies the Air Cruiser. Best described as heavy assault air units, the air cruisers don't become available until quite late in the game. As you might expect they're slow and extremely vulnerable but can deliver massive amounts of damage from long range, well beyond that of the game's turrets. There are two other new, civ-specific air units in the game. The new Rebel A-wing is a great hit and run attacker (although it's too far down the tech tree to be as useful as it could be). The Republic gains access to the Jedi Starfighter which combines the mobility of the regular fighter with whatever Jedi powers and technology you've researched.  The small balance changes really help to offset a few of the deficiencies of the previous game. First and most significantly, turrets of all kinds are more expensive and require longer to construct. This ameliorates the turtling that characterized many of the battles of the previous game but, even so, a defensive strategy based on the thoughtful placement of turrets is still almost impossible to beat until you gain access to the tech level 4 units and abilities. The sight and firing range of air units has been increased, as has the strength of mounted units when attacking buildings. This also tends to minimize the effectiveness of a turret-oriented defense. To help supplement the decreased effectiveness of the turrets, anti-air troops have been improved. They're now cheaper and less likely to take damage from air units.      The second most significant change affects the jedi. Feeling that they weren't quite powerful enough in the previous game, LucasArts has brought the cost of jedi research down considerably. Better still, jedis regenerate health quickly over time. There are quite a few other balance changes of note. Animal nurseries produce food much more quickly now and units garrisoned inside a defensive building increase the firepower of that building.   But even with that reduction in the effectiveness of fixed defenses, it's still not too difficult to repel the attacks of your enemies. While it has improved the AI still doesn't have the hang of creating and moving large armies around. As a result, the AI uses trickle tactics, sending small groups of units against your base intermittently. One thing the AI is very good at is escaping complete destruction. As in Age of Empires, a single stray worker can rebuild an entire base if he has enough resources to begin with. This results in a lot of worker chasing as you're trying to eliminate your enemies.  As usual, the voice actors recruited to voice the roles from the film are really quite good. The Count Dooku and Mace Windu performances are particularly compelling. The individual unit acknowledgements can get out of hand like they did in the first game. This is particularly true of the noisome naval units and the incredibly irritating Confederacy fighter. I almost gave up using them altogether because I can't stand the sound they make when you select them. The score is a pastiche of motifs and themes from the movie and all are incorporated very well. The general sound cues for certain generic triggers (winning a mission for instance) are a little generic.  Things have improved a bit in the area of graphics but the engine behind Clone Campaigns is definitely showing its age. There's more detail and more variety here, but there's still no escaping the fact that this game is based on an engine that is getting a little long in the tooth. It has other strengths, to be sure, but looks are not among them. Apart from the added variety of the tiles and sprites, the explosions are the only aspect of the graphics that have been noticeably improved. Perhaps someday, we can see a clone trooper who can face in more than 8 directions.  There are a few new areas that you can visit in the game. The hot, lava world of Sarapin shows off one of the new tile sets included in the game. Small animations help to bring the lava rivers to life here. You can also visit the Hutt-controlled world of Tatooine and even stop off for a beer at Mos Espa. The rocky world of Geonosis, the ice world of Eredenn and the dusty moon of Krant, Aereen, round out the new locations.  What did you think of Clone Campaigns?  And if you're not happy about any of those, there's an awesome scenario editor. Featuring a full set of map editing tools, you can create just about any location you'd like. From those big Gungan head statues to little Ewok huts to Sarlacc pits; it's all here. It's not laid out as well as I'd like in terms of control and the inability to scale the map or paint with a large brush means the work is a bit more tedious than it should be. Still the robust trigger system and campaign link mode let patient players do pretty much whatever they'd like.  Two significant additions have been made to multiplayer as well. First, there's now an option to increase the unit cap to 225 or 250 instead of being locked at 200. This means you can have even larger battles involving even more units. All of the space maps start you off with a space transport. If you're into rushing, this'll help a lot (although a prepared player can still repel your attacks even at the earliest stage). Random maps have also been incorporated to keep things simple and fresh. While I enjoyed playing Clone Campaigns, I find it hard to muster up a great deal of enthusiasm for the game. Maybe it has something to do with the pre-E3 crunch we normally experience. What's more likely is that the Age of Empires/Star Wars mix doesn't seem as fresh the second time around. While the engine was already a little behind others in terms of appearance last year, this year it looks even more dated. But graphics aren't the way I judge fun.Maybe it's because it presents a world that few of us are as familiar with as we were with the action from Episode 1 and the original trilogy featured in Galactic Battlegrounds. This time around, I don't know the characters as well, I'm not as familiar with the situations and I find myself not as involved in what goes on. But I can have fun with games without any prior knowledge of the story.So maybe it's not the age of the engine or the unfamiliarity of the story. Maybe it's simply that the Clone Campaigns focuses more on quantitative rather than qualitative improvements. This approach can work (as it did with the superlative Poseidon) but an expansion has to add a lot of content in addition to adding lots of new units.Don't get me wrong; Clone Campaigns is a good expansion, but it's not for those who aren't already passionate about a Star Wars-themed RTS. I anticipate that there are a good many of you out there who fit this category and I'm sure the timing of the release will only help sales. Still the game won't win over", "date": "May 16, 2002"}
