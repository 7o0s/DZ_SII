{"name": "Stewie 2.0", "name_review": "Family Guy's Stewie 2.0", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/04/family-guys-stewie-20", "text": "The animated sitcom ~Family Guy~ has a storied history of getting cancelled and resurrected by the frothing demand of avid fans. They voted with their dollars, snapping up so many DVD sets that FOX couldn't deny them new episodes any longer. The reason for such attachment is easy to see, the off-color humor is usually jaw-dropping or side-splitting -- or both, and the characters are just so bizarre and likable. Intellectual dog Brian, possibly latent baby Stewie, strong-willed Lois, and borderline retarded Peter -- all memorable creations that rightfully deserve their fans.   So, if you were Airborne and had the rights to ~Family Guy,~ you'd create a mobile game that really put fans in touch with the characters, right? Imagine my disappointment when I first booted up Stewie 2.0 and discovered that instead of controlling Stewie or Brian, I instead was treated to a strategy game involving a robot army. The plot tries to segue into the robot army thing, what with a cloned Stewie bent on domination and the kidnapping of the family. But when it comes down to it, keeping the characters at arm's length was a mistake.   As Stewie, you must free the trapped members of your family by engaging the cloned Stewie's blue robot army with your red robots. Each battle frees one of the family members, which do offer ~board effects~ on the battle, should you employ them. For example, if you free Brian, he can temporarily confuse enemy robots into attacking their teammates.   To free the family, you must beat evil(er) Stewie's robots by moving on a grid, planning attacks in advance. Stewie 2.0 really isn't unlike your basic turn-based strategy game, you have different units that offer varying talents: melee attacks, repairs, projectile attacks, etc. You must use these talents in conjunction to defeat the enemy. For example, the repair robot cannot take much damage and cannot attack, so you must keep it out of harm's way, but not too far from the action, should one of your attack bots get in trouble. Terrain plays into the game, too. Living room objects present either obstacles that must be circumvented completely or at least slow movement.   Stewie 2.0 does use some assets from the show, such as portraits of the family members. Stewie is almost always on-screen. And depending on if you win or lose, you'll get little comments that are accurate to the tyke twisted mind. For example, after winning a protracted battle, I was informed that ~This calls for a sexy party!~ Okay, how can you not smile at that?  Stewie 2.0 is not what I was expecting from a ~Family Guy~ game -- it reminds me of those occasions when a publisher gets a license and either retro-fits an existing game or just figures out the quickest way to get a game to market. Turn-based strategy? How does that connect to the license? Why not a platform game with Stewie riding Brian? Or Peter chasing the greased-up deaf guy? Or Quagmire searching for the ultimate peep hole?However, rather than wonder why Stewie 2.0 isn't those things, I need to grade what we do have. This is a basic turn-based strategy game with some depth that you can easily slip in and out of for short sessions. And I did appreciate the quips and presence of the cast members. But there's no way around my disappointment with the design choice. Only the most hardcore ~Family Guy~ fans should apply.", "date": "Nov 4, 2005"}
