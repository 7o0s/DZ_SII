With a huge development cycle and years worth of delays, nobody can say that it was rushed.  Developer Wolfpack has taken the time to craft the world the way they imagined it - a Guild vs. Guild environment with siege warfare, complimented by a complex class system.  With such a long development period and vast expectations, does it deliver?  Is this game really the ultimate Player vs. Player experience?  Read on to find out!   After logging in and a short full motion video movie, you find yourself at the character select screen.  Here you can create your character as well as customize various options such as sound and graphics.  A total of five character slots exist, much less than in any other mainstream online world.  After selecting a free slot and game world, you are taken to character creation.  First, you must choose your gender.  In most games this choice does not matter, but in Shadowbane it affects multiple things.  A few races cannot be female, such as the Half Giant.  Also, certain classes are male or female only - these will be addressed later.   Having selected your character's gender, you must then choose his or her race.  Shadowbane has a total of 10 races.  Each race has specific advantages and disadvantages and some also have unique talents.  For example, while the black skinned race of Shades may have low spirit, they also are given the natural ability to see hidden things.  Every race also has different starting statistics and a max amount, or cap, for each base statistic.  Another rule of thumb:  The more bonuses a race possesses, the less attribute points it receives for character customization later in creation.  This makes picking a race an extremely difficult choice.  Once you have picked gender and race, you need to pick a base class.  There are four base classes, the Fighter, Healer, Rogue and Mage.  Each class gives a few minor attribute bonuses, as well.   Once you have chosen a class, it's time to distribute attribute points.  This is one of the most interesting features of character creation because you can customize your character in a thousand different ways.  Each character has five base statistics - strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, and spirit.  Attribute points can be put directly into each statistic to raise them, and each statistic can be lowered by 5 to receive extra attribute points.  If you want the best character though, you have make use of the Runestone system.  Runestones increase many different attributes, or even provide a character with new ones, at the cost of attribute points.  For example, a base Rogue class cannot use a bow, but if you spend the points to do so, you can add a runestone that allows your Rogue to fling arrows with the best of them.  Runestones can range from adding 5 points to your sword skill all the way to adding 10 to your Spirit statistic and increasing its max by 10.  A well-built character must have a good balance between runestones and direct statistic increasing.  You can also customize the appearance of your character, although some races are severely lacking in the number of choices.   After you have entered the world with your character, a window will pop up asking you which town you would like to start at.  This window lets you choose between many different areas on the ~newbie~ island, as well as a few locations outside of it.  Unfortunately, new players will have absolutely no idea where they should start due to the lack of any tutorial.  Once you select a starting area, you enter into the world.  Shadowbane's interface is hit and miss.  All windows can be customized and moved around, but the clumsy manner of doing so will leave many players in the dark.  While the interface is better then many recent online titles, its not the best either.   Characters in Shadowbane move via a point and click interface.  Players of games such as Diablo and Dungeon Siege will feel right at home. One of the more unique features is that special attack and spell ~gems~ can be dragged anywhere on the combat screen and in an unlimited quantity.  Combat is very simple, pressing the C key enters combat mode.  When in this mode, all you have to do is double left click on any monster and you will start auto-attacking it.  During this auto-attack, phase skills and special attacks can be used by clicking the appropriate icon on your screen.  Finally, at default run speed it's impossible to get away from monsters, but all classes receive the sprint ability, and many receive run speed boost skills or spells.     Leveling in Shadowbane is extremely fast and pretty fun.  The Player vs. Monster side of Shadowbane is just as complex as most other games.  A wide range of spells from Crowd Control to Damage over Time can help you and your group defeat monsters.  One great thing about Shadowbane is the grouping system.  Grouping provides nearly no penalties.  A full group of 10 people will get nearly the same amount of experience per monster killed as a group of two people.  This promotes grouping and generally makes groups extremely easy to find.  Unfortunately, some people that enjoy soloing may find this a turn-off - but soloing is indeed still possible, just not nearly as fast.  Each time a level is gained, you receive attribute points and a set number of skill points.  Attribute points can be used just like in character creation.  Skill points are used at NPC Trainers to increase skills such as weapon proficiencies and magic attacks.     Upon reaching the 10th level you can promote to one of 18 classes.  Each class is totally unique, and provides something different to the group.  The classes are as follows:   Fighter classes: Barbarians are high-damage, high-hitpoint tanks.  Barbarians cannot take as many hits as other heavy tanks, but they are unparalleled in dishing out melee damage.  The Crusader is a heavy tank, with plate armor and a number of group-effect chants; they can become one of the best tanks in the game.  Templars have both offensive and defensive spells to aid them, as well as heavy armor. Warriors in Shadowbane are just like in most games, great tanks and can deal pretty good damage.  Fighter-based Warlocks, which can only be male, supply decent melee attack as well as spell casting attacks.  The Ranger has group-effect chants, as well as ranged attacks via bows.  And finally, the Huntress is adept in both bows and spears, as well as having the ability to use spells and call pets to her side.   Healer classes: The Channeler is a direct damage attacker which when in the healer line has buffs and heals.  The Confessor is a cross between a healer and a magic attacker, and receives great spells in both areas.  Priest-Crusaders are much the same as their fighter brothers, but have heals and buffs in place of higher melee attack power.  Druids are one of the main healers in the game.  They receive great heals, as well as Damage over Times and some minor crowd control spells.  Prelates are much like Priest-Crusaders, except they focus more on spell casting then melee damage.  Last, but not least, is the Priest.  They are the main healing class.  They receive many heals, including Heal over Times, as well as a variety of single and group buffs.   Mage classes: The Wizard is a pet-user with decent direct damage attacks and a few buffs.  The Warlock is much like his fighter-based cousin, except he has markedly weak attack and defense skills in return for greatly increased magic skills.  The female-only Furies have many different types of attack spells, including a wide assortment of Area Effect attacks.  Channelers, who like their Healer counterpart, also deal in direct damage spells, but they lack the healing and buffs Healer-based channelers have in return for a wider variety of magical based attacks.  The Assassin, a threat from afar and up close, due to magical attacks and high-power melee attacks.  And finally, the Bard has many group-effect chants.   Rogue classes: The Assassin, unlike his mage-based friend receives no magical attacks, but instead he or she receives higher melee damage and ways to hide from view.  Barbarians, much like fighter-based Barbarians, can do massive damage in a short amount of time.  Rogue-based Bards can do decent melee damage as well as having many group chants.  The Huntress and Ranger are both like their fighter-based counterparts.  They do a bit less damage in return for rogue-based abilities.  The Thief does average melee damage but has the advantage of sneaking up on players and stealing directly from their packs.  And lastly, the Scout can detect hidden and sneaking characters, as well as do average damage with his or her bow.   After the 20th level of experience is reached, you can choose a Discipline.  Disciplines are obtained through runes, found all over the world.  Each discipline can provide unique benefits to your characters, such as skills and abilities.  For example, a rogue class can find the ~Black Mask~ rune and apply it as his Discipline to allow him to use skills such as backstab.  Each discipline has a trainer located somewhere in the huge world, who can help you train the skills and abilities of the discipline.  Finally, once a discipline rune is applied, it is permanently equipped unless you erase the character.   At level 21 you are booted off the ~newbie island~ where Player vs. Player conflict is not allowed.  The most common area for new players to venture is the desert town of Khar.  This begins the first major change in Shadowbane - Player vs. Player is enabled.  Stepping outside of the town gates will allow you to be attacked by anyone and everyone, even people 35 levels over you.  ~Ganking~ as many people call it, consists of high-level players attacking low-level players, usually working to gain experience.  New players will likely encounter this usually a couple times, but blind luck usually dictates how often you are ganked.  Most major guilds I have come across outlaw this behavior and even hunt any players that do this.  Still, this can be an unfortunate deterrent for new players that are not used to the harsh reality of a fully Player vs. Player game.   Most completely new players will experience levels 21 through 36 in and around the town of Khar.  Groups are easy to find, and the town provides access to all trainers and merchants.  After you have reached the 36th level though, another major change takes place.  Players must leave the computer-controlled guild and have to find a player-created guild of their own.  Usually by this time, you will have had experience with players that have invited you to their guilds - and it seems like everyone wants you.  Guilds provide protection, player-created towns, and most importantly, friends with whom to hunt.  Guilds also have game-created bonuses, such as experience and health regeneration bonuses when in a guild-only group. It's likely that you will encounter members of the ~big guilds~.  Each server tends to have 2 or 3 main guilds, with hundreds, even thousands of people in it.  The ability of a smaller guild to pledge loyalty to a larger guild results in the creation of these mammoth organizations.  This allows the smaller guilds who would normally have no chance in creating and defending a huge town to have access to many more resources.     The Guild System allows large, city-owning guilds to create Nations.  Nations consist of multiple large guilds that are allied and working towards the same goals.  Advantages of being in a nation can vary, but generally guild cities and hunting areas (and sometimes resources) are shared in common between the partner guilds.  Being ~guild-less~ in Shadowbane is nearly impossible and will cause a player to miss a significant portion of the game.  Of course, this does not mean anything unless guilds have towns!  All cities need a starting point, and in Shadowbane the town-building cycle begins with the Tree of Life.  The seed for this tree can be purchased for a large amount of gold and planted to grow the foundations of a city.  The Tree of Life is the root and main point of any city, so guarding it is extremely important.   City building is one of the most unique features of Shadowbane.  Cities are required to train and buy high-level items.  Computer controlled towns can only supply the needs of a guild up to a certain point.  Creating buildings is accomplished by purchasing deeds that are then used by guild members who have permission to build.  When building, you are taken to a screen, much like in a simulation game, where you can place the building, rotate it, and select numerous other options.  Once placed it acts like any other building in the game.  Each building can be classified by three basic attributes: Type, Class, and Stage.  Type determines what sort of tradesmen can work in the building and what purpose the building serves.  An armorsmith is cannot work in a Wizards Tower for example.  Rank determines what how many tradesmen a building can hold and how fast they work.  Finally, stage determines the actual appearance of the building.  Stage is increased as the buildings rank increases.  For example, a building at Rank 5 will be at Stage 3.   All buildings cost gold to maintain. In addition to maintenance, buildings cost money to upgrade.  Upgrading is not an instant process; it takes time like everything else.  Another interesting feature is that each building can furnished.  Furniture placement is very similar to building placement, by using deeds you can place the furniture inside buildings.  Finally, all buildings have a hit point value.  Gold can be used to repair buildings, although like most things, the process is not instantaneous and it takes time.   Tradesmen are hired via employment contracts purchased from Stewards.  Like buildings, tradesmen require gold as pay, and also can be upgraded, which in turn teaches your tradesmen more skills.  For example, a Priest trainer may not teach a certain healing spell until he is Rank 5, so he would have to be upgraded five times.  Upgrading tradesmen also takes time.  Tradesmen can be hired for just about everything in the game, including class trainers and merchants.  One fun thing is that high-ranked merchants randomly generate magical items, much like in Diablo.  Much fun can be had checking them all out each time you journey into town.  Players are also given the ability to set the profit margin on tradesmen, and in turn, make money on them.   Finally, all towns need a defense, and the first key to any defense is walls.  Walls are placed much like buildings, in that you are required to purchase a deed.  While walls are the first step, many other things are needed to create an adequate defense - walls cannot stop everything.  Flying classes, for example, can fly right over them.  Towers can also be placed, as well as numerous wall segments.  Wall segments are special areas in the wall which are slightly different.  For example, the Gatehouse is a long stretch of outer wall with a large gate, surrounded by towers.  Other segments such as stairs to the upper levels can also be placed.  Finally and most importantly are the minions.  Minions are hired from specialized tradesmen.  Three types of minions exist - Adepts, mage classes who attack with spells, Archers, who attack from afar, and finally, Guards who attack with melee.  Just like other tradesmen, minions can also be upgraded in power.  While these minions are no match for powerful players, they can help defend the city fairly well.     The main aspect and selling point of Shadowbane is Guild vs. Guild warfare.  While leveling and city building will take up some of your time, they can only entertain for so long.  The ~end-game~ so to speak, consists of sieging opposing cities and guilds, while defending your own.  The keys to sieges are Bane Circles and the Tree of Life.  Bane Circles represent the attackers, and the tree of life Tree of Life represents the defenders.   When sieges start, there are three phases.  The first phase is the Challenge Phase.  This begins as soon as the attacking force summons a Bane Circle.  During the challenge phase, the defending guild may set a time for the second phase to begin.  The second phase begins at the designated time, or 24 hours after the bane circle is summoned.  The second phase involves readying an army on both sides.  During this time, both the Tree of Life and the Bane Circle are still invulnerable.  This phase ends 72 hours after the bane circle is summoned, or at the time set by the defending guild.  The third and final phase is the War Phase.  During this time, both the Bane Circle and Tree of Life are vulnerable, and the Tree of Life's protection on various city buildings is also removed.  This phase has no time limit, and ends when either the Tree of Life or Bane Circle is destroyed.   The sieging system goes much deeper then this, and includes siege weapons, many commands, and a host of various options for both defenders and attackers.  Unfortunately, during the time I played it was extremely hard to get adequate playtime in the siege system.  This is due to both the newness of the game, but even more so, the constant crashing of the client when in highly populated areas.  Granted, this system still seems to have promise.  Many interesting tactics have already been pioneered.  For example, the Fury class can cast group flight and allow an entire group to fly right over the walls into the defending town, making for an interesting surprise upon those waiting inside.       The graphics of Shadowbane are a mixed bag.  Some buildings and landscapes are fairly detailed and look very good at higher settings.  The character models, however, are severely lacking and some are just downright ugly.  The graphics are also severely unoptomized. Shadowbane can take its toll and slow even powerful systems down to a crawl at times.  In my experience this happened only in specific areas, where often there was absolutely no reason for a slow-down to occur.  I could run through the exact same area over and over, and every single time my frames per second would drop to a crawl.  Spell effects are not bad at all, but they are also nothing to write home about.  The background music, on the other hand, is very well done for the most part.  The music shapes the feel of the area, be it swamplands or the desert.  The sound effects are good, but you will often get tired of hearing the same chants over and over if you are a spellcaster.   The game itself demonstrates mediocre performance on a high-end machine.  As stated above, graphics can slog down your system's frames-per-second in some areas, and client crashes happen far too often.  In large Guild vs. Guild battles, it's not uncommon to crash every few minutes.  Wolfpack claims they are working on patches to solve these problems though, but so far nothing has come of them.  Our primary test machine is an AMD Thunderbird 2100+ with 512 megs of ram and a GeForce 4 Ti4600.  On this machine, framerates were normally between 25 and 35, sometimes reaching as high as 60, and sometimes as low as 2.  The game also has a windowed mode, as well as alt-tab support.   Unfortunately there are some major problems with Shadowbane.  The first is the lack of a decent tutorial for new players.  The 176-page manual helps a little, but the in-game tip system is extremely useless and at times burdensome.  A totally new player will be completely lost without the help of outside sources such as fansites.  Another issue also deals with Shadowbane's ~newbie-friendliness~ (or lack thereof).  One of the unfortunate side effects of being on the newbie island is that when you die, anyone can loot your corpse.  When on the main-land, you can hunt and kill the looter, but on newbie island there is nothing that can be done due to the lack of Player vs. Player.  The lack of skill resets is also an extremely large problem.  Most skill-based games currently have a way to reset, or ~respec,~ skills.  Already, after only one patch, a few classes have been weakened due to skills being changed.  Currently, the only way to fix this is to delete and remake your character.   Another issue with Shadowbane is the question of longevity.  Many people I have met in my experience are already starting to get tired of the Guild vs. Guild aspect.  While extremely complex and interesting at first glance, normal, casual players will not be taking part in city-building or guild management.  They will just be a normal guild member, or in army terms, a grunt, that collects gold and hands it off to those that are higher in charge.  Yet another issue that has already reared its head is the fact that large guilds can completely overpower smaller ones.  On some servers, one guild could totally wipe out every one of their counterparts, if they so desired.  With no safeguards in place, it's possible that this could become a very common problem, and guild vs. guild amount to nothing but crushing smaller, new cities.Overall Shadowbane is a decent game.  Its not great by any means, but it does provide one of the most satisfactory Player vs. Player experiences of any current online world.  The fast leveling is great to get right to the action, but without skill respecs it means you will be erasing and remaking the same character multiple times if you want to be at peak efficiency.  Most casual players will never experience how in-depth the city creation and guild system is, so it removes a large part of the game for them.  Shadowbane is a good game for hardcore MMORPG fans.  Unfortunately, this is not the game for someone who is new to online worlds or for anyone who detests Player vs. Player combat.", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
