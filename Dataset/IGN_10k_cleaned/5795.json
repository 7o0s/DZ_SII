The damn game boasted no less than 11 full-functioning radio stations covering just about every genre imaginable from rap to country to reggae, electronic, and classic funk. The track-listing alone was massive beyond belief and set a benchmark for videogame soundtracks.That the Rockstar crew and Interscope records had the additional balls to release an 8-disc box set that encapsulates roughly 75% of the in-game music deserves additional kudos. Trying to review such an endeavor, on the other hand, is nothing less than daunting. Not only that, but it also boils down to a simple matter of taste and more or less griping about what did and didn't make the cut. For in essence the GTA:SA soundtrack box set is nothing more than a massive mix CD teeming with classic tracks that most devout popular music aficionados will already own in some configuration or another. Then again having more than 80 tracks conveniently boxed together sure as hell makes for a great party platter of sound that's tailor-made to be placed in the multi-disc player, slipped into ~shuffle~ overdrive, and just allowed to play continuously until it's rotated through the entire set.Disc 1: Playback FM/Radio Los SantosSadly, the first disc on the set is a combo of two of the game's radio stations, Playback FM, which specializes in classic hip-hop, and Radio Los Santos, which focuses on predominantly West Coast, mostly Los Angeles based, rap. That the box set is devoid of two separate discs devoted to what are ostensibly the more popular radio stations from the game is a crying shame. That small complaint aside, this disc packs some pretty solid choices. Tracks from Public Enemy (~Rebel Without A Pause~), Brand Nubian (~Brand Nubian~), Slick Rick (~Children's Story~), Eric B. & Rakim (~I Know You Got Soul~), and Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock (~It Takes Two~), unfold like a beginner's history lesson of New School rap. Anyone not familiar with these tracks or the artists who made them is indeed in for a serious wake-up call. The latter portion of the disc drops the needle on latter period New School from the Left Coast, boasting numbers from Kid Frost, The D.O.C., Da Lench Mob, Compton's Most Wanted, Cypress Hill, and 2 Pac. The inclusion of artists like D.O.C., Frost, CMW, and Da Lench Mob, who have more or less become cult legends, all but forgotten by today's Eminem/Nelly/50 Cent brigade of rap fans, is not only brilliant, but shows that the cats who put the game together knew a thing or two about the genre.  Sadly, the disc is devoid of some of the in-game classic by the likes of Kool G. Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Old School legend Spoonie Gee, Gang Starr, the diabolical Biz Markie, and proverbial underground living legends Ultramagnetic MCs. The latter half of the disc is missing prime cuts from Too $hort, Dr. Dre, N.W.A., Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and Above The Law, perhaps some of the most important West Coast artists to leave their impression on the rap world. Their omission from the box set is almost enough to make you forget that isn't a single Ice-T track anywhere to be found (either in the game or in the box set). Still, as a primer and a soundtrack to the action packed game play, one could do far worse.The disc is more or less set up like a loose radio show, complete with station IDs and commercials, which are inserted between tracks just as they would be on a real radio broadcast. This shtick is repeated throughout the various albums included in the box set, with the DJs and commercials being ribaldry over-the-top and expressly tailored to the specific demographic of the GTA radio listeners (i.e. the commercials on this disc have an urban slant, those on the country disc have a ~redneck~ vibe, and so on). Really the only complaint is that most of the discs feature two or more ~commercials~ tacked on at the end. It would have created a smoother flow had they been evenly spread out on each disc.Disc 2: K ROSENothing but country music, baby. This is perhaps the most surprising and as such, most entertaining installment of the entire box set. 10 slices of classic country from a wide variety of legends including Willie Nelson, Hank Williams, Jerry Reed, Merle Haggard, and others. As with the previous rap oriented disc, this one is more or less a ~greatest hits~-styled jukebox compilation featuring a bevy of old familiars like ~Crazy,~ ~All My Ex's Live In Texas,~ ~Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys.~ But there are some nice surprises, as well, especially for those not honed into the whole classic country repertoire. Conway Twitty & Loretta Lynn serve up the wonderful duet ~Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man,~ while Jerry Reed (best know to pop culture vultures as ~Snowman~ from Smokey & The Bandit) kicks it out on ~Amos Moses.~The joy of this disc is that it serves up real country music, eschewing any of the overly slick, pop oriented pap that has dogged the genre for the past 20 years. Let's face it, when most folks hear the term ~country music~ they cringe with involuntary expediency. Yet the Rockstar folks have managed to present the genre is a solid light, crafting a sweet mix of tunes that will not only appeal to the closet redneck gamer, but also to the open-minded music head looking for something a little different with which to feed their hungry ears.  Disc 3: Bounce FMOld School-meets-New School funk. That's what this disc is all about, whether it's dishing out the sublimely pervasive swing of Kool & The Gang (the seminal ~Hollywood Swingin'~) or the squiggly whine of The Ohio Players' ~Funky Worm~ mixed with newer fangled efforts from the likes of Cameo and Maze. The Kool & The Gang, Ohio Players, The Gap Band (~You Dropped A Bomb On Me~), and Ronnie Hudson (~West Coast Poplock~) are a bit redundant in that they are known staples of the genre. Picking lesser known, though still seminal, numbers by Rick James (~Cold Blooded~) and Roy Ayers (~Running Away~) helps round out the disc and make it, like Playback FM/Radio Los Santos, a good primer for those unfamiliar with the genre as a whole. Though one can't help but wonder why the Fatback and Lakeside tracks, which are included in the game, didn't make the box set cut.Disc 4: K-DSTAs with just about all the discs in the set, the Rockstar definition of what comprises the genre of ~Classic Rock~ is both to be applauded and questioned. Tracks by the likes of KISS meld with numbers by America, The Who, and Rod Stewart. Inclusions like ~Free Bird~ seem both clich and ironic (although wouldn't each of those cancel out the other?), while Grand Funk Railroad and Humble Pie prove to be wonderfully left field choices. And if hearing Eddie Money's ~Two Tickets To Paradise~ doesn't get you lip-synching and raising your lighter into the air, well then you've not only lost that loving feeling, you've forgotten how to imbibe in the joy of forgotten arena rock bliss. Given the overall vibe of this disc, it can be said that the presence of America, KISS, and Rod Stewart are a little out of place, but then they also add to the aforementioned clichd irony factor.Disc 5: Master SoundsThis disc kind of picks up where Bounce FM left off, albeit it goes for much more of a classic funk/soul vibe that is heavily laced with the work of ~the hardest working man in show business,~ Mr. James Brown himself. Brown and/or one or more of his prodigies dot the disc from Lyn Collins to The J.B.s, and Maceo Parker. Some veritable nuggets are included, though, like Sir Joe Quarterman & Free Soul's horn heavy shakedown ~(I Got) So Much Trouble In My Mind,~ The Chakachas' slinky Latin-tinged, sweat drenched, hot summer slide ~Jungle Fever,~ and ~Smokin' Cheeba Cheeba~ by the Harlem Underground Band, which features some moist harmonica and swanked out verbal patter from the mojo infatuated hootchie-cootchie man who narrates the dusted groove. Next to K ROSE's country mash-out, this is perhaps the most essential disc in the entire set and deserving of multiple repeat listens. And like the earlier rap numbers, this disc is a history lesson of sampled beats. Heads with an ear to the street will pick up on beats and breaks that have been jacked by PE, Dre, EPMD, and others. Another great and essential primer for those who wish to bone up on their funkafied history.  Disc 6: CSR 103.9A full disc of New Jack Swing, baby! That's what this one brings to the table. So, if you hanker for a hunk of Joe, a slab of Bobby Brown, and a taste of Boyz II Men, as well as side dishes of Bell Biv Devoe, Aaron Hall, and Ralph Tresvant, then this is totally your bag. If you despise the super slick, contemporary R&B shuffle, well then you best steer clear. Then again, even if you do, it's hard to pass up, let alone ignore the infectious use of James Brown's ~Payback~ as the underlying thrust groove coupled with tasty flute loops on En Vogue's catchy hit ~My Lovin' (Never Gonna Get It).~ Interestingly enough, the ladies from En Vogue are the only femme fatales representing on this disc other than SWV. Hmmm, what's up with that?Disc 7: K-JAHJoining both the K ROSE and Master Sounds discs to create the triumvirate of essential GTA:SA soundtrack discs is this reggae stuffed gem. As with the country joint, this one serves up some wonderfully nice surprises, especially for those new to the genre or in need of a serious tune up. Everybody from Max Romeo & The Upsetters to such well-known players as Black Uhuru, Barrington Levy, Augustus Pablo, Toots & The Maytals, and runs the gamut from more down-tempo traditional numbers to the more rowdier boom-bap of dancehall bangers like Pliers' ~Bam Bam~ and Reggie Stepper's ~Drum Pan Sound.~ The Rockstar crew again earn serious kudos for not going the predictable route (i.e. Bob Marley or other more well-known to the masses reggae artists) and for covering a wide range of the genre, whether it's the serious dub reverberations of ~King Tubby Meets The Rockers Uptown~ by Augustus Pablo, the old school soul shuffle of ~Funky Kingston~ by Toots & The Maytals or the drug addled patter of Dillinger on ~Cocaine In My Brain.~ Again, this is a sweet primer to the genre, illustrating that the Rockstar posse has a firm grasp on one of the more important (and often overlooked) genres of modern music.Disc 8: Radio XLike so many of the discs in this set, the one dedicated to Alternative/Modern Rock is a mixed bag. Dwelling rather heavily on the more heavy rock oriented elements of the genreSoundgarden, Helmet, Faith No More, STP, Rage, Danzig, and Living Colourthe album tends to skew a little to one side. Sure, there's the almost bizarre inclusion of Depeche Mode's ~Personal Jesus,~ which seems downright misplaced sandwiched between ~Mother~ by Danzig and ~Been Caught Stealing~ by Jane's Addiction (never mind that the Jane's number is a poppy retreat from the otherwise skirling guitar dominated disc). And while L7 fit nicely into the rawk vibe, they are the only femme fatales represented, which is a shame considering how many woman fronted groups have existed (and continue to exist) within the confines of Modern Rock. Granted the disc does avoid obvious choice from FNM (they could easily have stuck in ~Epic~ and catered to the mainstream, but thankfully went for the lesser known ~Midlife Crisis~), but for each of these nice sidesteps, there's at least two, often three no-brainers (~Killing In The Name~ by RATM, ~Plush~ by STP, ~Cult of Personality~ by LC). For a genre that is so rich in eclectic rock anthems, this disc could have been a serious ball buster. Instead it's just a run-of-the-mill sampling of Modern Rock.In the end the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Official Soundtrack Box Set is primarily geared toward hardcore fanatics of the game as it's essentially a massive ~best of~ broken into eight different genres, featuring a plethora of music, most of which, while great, is still predictable. Granted there are some wonderful surprises in the form of the K ROSE, Master Sounds, and K-JAH discs, but on the whole the surprises are few and far between. Top that off with the erratic way each disc has been formatted, specifically in terms of track-listing transitions, primarily the annoying practice of continually tacking on not only a final station ID, but two commercials, at the end of each disc, ultimately makes the entire box set a somewhat uneven listening experience.Even with the blemishes Grand Theft Auto is a surprisingly fun and extensive game on the Game Boy Advance. The portable rendition retains much of what has made the series, starting with Grand Theft Auto III such a success on the PlayStation 2, and it's clear that Digital Eclipse understood the idea of the series...even in its 2D design. It's definitely one the most ambitious games created on the Game Boy Advance.I have no problem admitting that I thought that the original Grand Theft Auto and its sequel sucked; they were boring games on the PlayStation, and it was only when the series moved to 3D on the PlayStation 2 with Grand Theft Auto III that I really appreciated what the series had to offer. This 2D Game Boy Advance design, at the very least, vastly improves on the originals, and fixes the game so much that it's now a great, recommended action title. It was definitely worth the long wait.", "date": "Jun 8, 2005"}
