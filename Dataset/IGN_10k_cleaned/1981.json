The team is very big in the sound driver department, providing impressive sound technologies for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance in games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and Earthworm Jim. But the team's also a game designer, and its first title for the Game Boy Advance is also a launch title. Like the team's sound drivers, Iridion 3D is an amazing technology demo that pushes the Game Boy Advance in several impressive directions. But in gameplay, the title is flat, redundant, and lacks the necessary variety to keep the action interesting. Great graphics and decent sound are only half the job -- the game has to be fun, too, and Iridion 3D just doesn't have the goods in this department.  Features Seven levels Seven boss battles Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Iridion 3D rewinds back to the old-school shooter days where bullets were plenty and ships could only move on a overhead or side-view plane. The design here puts the advanced capabilities of the Game Boy Advance to use, as the game is a little more like Sega's Space Harrier or Panzer Dragoon. The camera is fixed in a behind-the-ship perspective, and all the enemy threats are coming in head-on -- with quick thumb movements, you'll need to rapid-fire your way through the game's seven levels and seven boss battles to be victorious in Iridion 3D.  Graphically, Iridion is incredibly slick -- those folks in Germany have created a game engine that gives the impression of 3D while only exploiting the Game Boy Advance's 2D capabilities. So when you're zooming down an enclosed corridor, it's actually a pre-rendered, looping sequence to give the illusion that it's an advanced 3D technique. This effect is used all over the place in Iridion 3D, as is the smooth sprite scaling and rotation that the GBA can handle -- enemies zoom and rotate in and out of battle, and the action never slows down even with so many bullets and enemy ships on screen. The audio soundtrack is also equally impressive, offering upbeat pieces of classic ~shooter~ music that'll encourage the use of headphones for the full effect. Even the menu sequence is overwhelmingly cool, with a 3D effect in place for selecting game options.  Unfortunately, that's where the first impressions end, as the title's gameplay and technique is as basic as you can get...and it's this that just sucks the fun out of it. All you can do is move your ship in an up, down, left, and right fashion, and shoot. Other than the basic gun power-ups, there are no super weapons, bombs that will destroy everything on-screen in a last-ditch move, or any special ship maneuvers to escape a serious onslaught of enemy fire. All the levels are of the ~shoot everything and weave out of the way when they get close~ fashion.  It would have been to the game's advantage if there were more levels that required more maneuvering than shooting -- like the trench run in the classic Star Wars arcade game. Some level feature this gameplay element (like the lava levels with the columns of fire to avoid), but it's few and far between.  It's also the perspective that also makes the game very frustrating to play -- it's extremely difficult to judge distances on the Game Boy Advance's small screen, so bullets and ships that may look like they're out in the distance can actually hit your ship. Sure, it makes the game a challenge to play -- but when you're more frustrated than amused, you'll just not want to play the game...and in the case of Iridion 3D, there's just no incentive to continue forward when there's no real change in level design other than impressive background animations.  I commend Majesco and Shin'en for approaching a title such as Iridion 3D -- the game is, visually and aurally, one of the most impressive titles on the system. However, pretty pictures and an amazing soundtrack does not make a great game, and where this game falls apart is in its redundant and flat gameplay -- it's just not exciting to play. I think Shin'en is completely capable of pulling off wonders on the Game Boy Advance, but their first attempt at an original game design is just a little too weak for my tastes.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
