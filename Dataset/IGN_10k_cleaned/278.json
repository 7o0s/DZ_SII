Ever since I had a nasty fall as a child skiing,  I've had an aversion to anything involving snow. But there's something undeniably cool about snowboarding.   The game is all downhill boarding (there aren't any freestyle sections, like half-pipes), and your only opponent is the clock. Without other racers to distract you, the focus is set squarely on your performance. You are judged on two accounts: your time down the mountain, and the amount of points you've racked up for doing tricks, like three-sixties and fakies. The tricks look great, although no matter how difficult a move you've just done the announcer is never quite satisfied!   All of the tricks and speed wouldn't amount to anything if the feeling wasn't there. But Cool Boarders has some of the best racing physics this side of Jet Moto. Like Jet Moto, turning takes a little getting used, but once you've got the ~carve~ down you won't have any problems negotiating trees and rocks.   While there are only five tracks, Novice, Advanced, and Expert, each getting progressively harder than the last, plus two hidden ones, the tracks do have a lot of replay value when you throw in the tricks. Also, an interesting little feature in Cool Boarders is the ~ghost~ racer, actually a replay of you racing your previous race. It's a little confusuing, seeing yourself meging in and out with a second boarder, but it does help push you to beat your previous time.   Cool Boarders should have gotten an 8 out of 10 with us, but the graphics seem to have been slapped together at the last minute. The snow on the tracks is nicely textured, but the racers themselves are chunky and stiff. And there's no getting around all the thick, black seams in the track, made worse by the fact that the ground is all white! The Expert Level is especially glitchy.   Physics aside, Cool Boarders shows signs of being a very rushed game. Which is a shame, as it could've been a top-notch game. As it stands, it's just good.", "date": "Dec 14, 1996"}
