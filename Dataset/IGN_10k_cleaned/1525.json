After waiting so long, after hundreds of screens and dozens of moves, a month of Countdown features, heaps of hideous questions, reading e-mail after e-mail with lines like ~can u do the 3d thru a table answer plz.~  It's done, it's here, and the torment of Marc Nix is over.  WWF Smackdown 2: Know Your Role.  We know that this is a momentous occasion for PlayStation-owning wrestling fans the world over, but please pardon us if we can't quite work up the energy to cheer.  We, I'm afraid, are Smackdowned out.  We ought to be able to muster some kind of enthusiasm, though, because after the tortuous months of covering its development, the game has proven to be what we'd hoped it would be all along, clearly the best wrestling game on the PlayStation and packing a feature set much larger and well-rounded than the original Smackdown.  THQ delivered gameplay last time, and now we've got almost all the trimmings to go with it, including a very complete, up-to-date roster and a much-improved create-a-wrestler mode.  The season mode is still, to sum things up bluntly, pretty whacko, and the absence of audio commentary remains a serious sticking point, but all the other odds and ends in this game should be more than enough to keep you happy until the PlayStation 2 hosts its own WWF outing.  Gameplay  Smackdown 2 employs the same grappling engine used by its predecessor, a modified version of the system developer Yuke's designed for the New Japan-licensed Toukon Retsuden series some years back.  There are two basic buttons - grapple and strike - which perform all of your attacks.  Variations are performed by combining the attack buttons with a single D-pad direction and attacking your opponent from different directions while they are in different positions.  As in something like No Mercy or Attitude, there are also basic motions for blocks and reversals to learn, although they can always be circumvented by careful timing or positioning.  The computer AI seems fairly well-balanced in that regard, by the way.  You have to be aggressive and position yourself well, but the game doesn't take an unfair advantage - you'll never see yourself being slammed and not understand why.  A nagging problem remains the fact that the Smackdown grappling system is just a little bit too simple.  It's based on the Toukon Retsuden system, but for uncertain reasons (to represent the more limited movesets of American wrestlers, or on account of a mistaken belief that Americans suck at wrestling games, I don't know) they've taken out one of the grappling buttons.  Toukon Retsuden has three attack buttons: one for strikes that works just like the strike in Smackdown, and two for grapples, one that performs power moves and one that executes submissions.  In Smackdown, they've taken out the submission attack, so you run out of moves to perform comparatively quickly.  Counting variations of directional control and opponent positioning/status, any given wrestler can only have about a dozen different standing grapple moves - which may sound like a lot, but it's easily beaten by the movesets in something like Toukon Retsuden or one of the better Fire Pro games.  If the movesets are somewhat limited, though, the match options are anything but.  Once you've unlocked all the goodies in Season Mode, almost any gimmick match you'd ever want to play is available (along with some that I can't see anybody bothering with, like the casket match).  Ladder matches, table matches, and tables-ladders-chairs matches are available for those interested in brainless violence, and you can re-create the grudge matches of old with options like Iron Man and I Quit.  At press time, we have found no way to gouge your opponent in the eye with a sharp piece of wood, but that's an NWA thing anyway.  Unlocking those modes can be a bit of a tricky matter, though.  The Season mode, where you find most of the game's secrets, and which is one of the biggest selling points of Smackdown 2, remains a textbook case of unused potential.  In theory, it's an excellent idea, letting you explore the kind of extended narratives that make wrestling so interesting in real life, but in practice the implementation has just grown too complex for the developers to get right.  Progression is slow, disjointed, and features hardly any interesting dialogue.  The problem seems to be that there are just too many wrestlers to keep in the mix, so the game takes the simple route of ignoring most of them.  You can enter the season mode with any number of different wrestlers, head to the first card, and find that you aren't actually booked on it.  All you can do is sit and watch the game cycle through AI-controlled matches, brutal load times, and cinematic bits that don't seem to lead anywhere, hoping that something more interesting lies around the corner.  Now that I think about it, it's a pretty good simulation of what life is like for your average WWF midcarder, but that doesn't make it fun.  The atmospherics of the game in general, though, and its representation of the WWF, are superb.  The gimmicks and personas of most wrestlers are accurate up to fairly recently, including elements like a mostly-complete Right to Censor, and almost everyone has a perfect introductory movie.  The Undertaker and Steve Austin have their old unlicensed theme music, but that's not such a great loss, and I like to think that the Shawn Michaels introduction more than makes up for that lapse.  Wrestlers have plenty of their signature mannerisms in the ring and in their introductions, and while the season mode is more than half a slog, it occasionally features moments of visual brilliance.  The 3D through the table that you all want to see so badly is there.  Graphics  The overall quality of the polygon models in Smackdown 2 hasn't changed a great deal, but they didn't necessarily need to - they were always very smooth and detailed.  The new models adhere to the same standards, with plenty of nice touches of detail (writing on Tazz's taped fists, the Hardy Boyz's torn-up sleeves), and the character animation is extremely good, despite the huge number of wrestlers and moves available.  There's very refined collision detection on almost all moves with all different sizes of wrestlers, and the motions are nearly perfect.  The game includes complex animations for things that you'd think they wouldn't even bother trying to replicate - an entire Worm, a perfect People's Elbow, and awesome cinematic animations in season mode like Too Cool dancing and a frantic table-destroying assault by the Dudley Boyz.  Smart camera direction adds to each move, especially when you perform the same one repeatedly - varying angles stop the repetition from being quite so dull.  The arenas are definitely improved, and the addition of massive backstage areas rather puts to bed any potential advantage WCW Backstage Assault might have had on the competition.  There is a LOT of space for hardcore-title brawls in Smackdown 2, and a ton of things to do there.  There are rooms where you can drive a forklift.  You can get run over by cars, or slam opponents on the hoods of cars, or dive off cars onto other wrestlers.  You can smash tables, hit people with tables, brain guys with sofas, knock them against soda machines and wallop them with the cans that pop out.  A heck of a lot of work went into this component of the stage design, and it's paid off in a mode that beats anything on the market for sheer geek-show value.  The main arenas aren't quite so creative, but they don't need to be - just refined, and they are.  The weekly show and PPV sets convey a good feeling of size, the crowd is detailed (even including specific signs for each wrestler in the ring), and there are extra touches of interactivity like breakable announce tables and ~ka-bong~ effects for the ringposts.  Customization  Smackdown now has a create-a-wrestler mode to match the now completely-forgotten WWF Attitude.  To answer a painfully common question, you can now store at least 10 different custom wrestlers.  To replace the simple suite of Duplo-block character chunks from the first game, there's a complete suite of cosmetic options that let you build almost any character you'd like, from a grotesquely mutated parody of Edge to remarkably faithful likenesses of past stars like Scott Hall (with a tip of the hat to my old colleague Chris Hoffman).  Their movesets are also completely customizable, naturally.  That's the customization mode that you're likely to spend the most time in, with Create-a-Stable close behind.  This doesn't sound like the most interesting of modes, but the gag potential is massive.  Essentially, you can take a few wrestlers and give them any name, intro movie, and intro animation set that you want.  In other words, any tag team can dance like Too Cool, or hop on a bike and ride to the ring like the Undertaker - with a little creativity you can come up with some hilarious stuff.  Create-a-PPV and Create-a-Taunt give those with a mind to tinker some room to maneuver in, but they're less versatile and user-friendly than the other modes.  The PPV editor doesn't let you come up with anything particularly interesting, though (you can invent your own card, but what of it?), and Create-a-Taunt, while it has an awful lot of potential, is harder than hell to get the hang of.  Sound  Kinda quiet for a wrestling game, isn't it?  I'm glad I'm not hearing Michael Cole, but it would be nice to have commentary from the classic Jim Ross/Jerry Lawler team (Tazz is too much to hope for, I know).  The musical accompaniment for most matches is generic hard rock, nothing much to write home about.  The sound effects, on the other hand, add plenty to the atmosphere, even just the sound of the bouncing mat after a hard slam or suplex.  The crowd is less dynamic than in some wrestling games, but the shouts and cheering definitely vary during the course of a match.  The vaunted speech elements in the game, just by way of covering all the bases, are a disappointment.  Basically, you'll just hear a few catchphrase snippets here and there in the season mode.  It's a damned shame that good voices keep eluding Smackdown, because that remains the principal element keeping it from completely erasing the memory of Acclaim's wrestling games (and goodness knows we want to forget them). The best wrestling game around, and when the comparison to the first Smackdown comes up, it's clear that THQ is giving you a lot more for your repeat business than buyers of No Mercy on the N64.  Smackdown 2 is worth buying for the beefed-up creation modes alone, but with that you also get a heap of new wrestlers, most of them ones I'd actually want to play as, the awesome backstage brawl levels, more moves, more cool FMV, and all the other odds and ends.The wish list is still there, though, if only because we've spent so much time with this game that the flaws tend to stand out a bit in our eyes.  By next Christmas on PS2, we'd like to see audio commentary (JR on play-by-play and Tazz on color, thanks) and a career mode that actually works properly.  A wider variety of moves would be nice too, to provide the best possible bang for our create-a-wrestler buck, 'cause I'm danged sick of seeing that inverted DDT over and over again.Let's get out of the quibble zone and back to reality, though.  Smackdown 2, if it's the last wrestling game on the PlayStation (which is likely), is a fine high note to go out on - no WWF fan is liable to be disappointed by what they get when they pick it up, as they undoubtedly will.  Yeah, you know you would have bought it, no matter what we said.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
