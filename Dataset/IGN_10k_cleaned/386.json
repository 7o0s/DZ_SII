{"name": "Tail Concerto", "name_review": "Tail Concerto", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/10/tail-concerto", "text": "With yet another kooky anime game under its belt (following the RPG Thousand Arms), it comes as little surprise that Atlus has whipped up another great game for the PlayStation. Boasting a cute cast of anthropomorphic cats and dogs, Tail Concerto has a phenomenally cartoonish appeal and interesting character design to follow it up. Essentially a platform game with little tidbits of RPG and adventure thrown in here and there, Tail Concertow -- which hit release shelves about 18 months ago in Japan -- has finally arrived in North America. Story  Tail Concerto takes place in a time and place when human-esque felines and canines dwelled together, when the cat-people felt hostile toward the dog-people, and when the legend of the Iron Giant was familiar with creatures the whole world 'round.  In this realm five very powerful crystals existed; when collected, the user of them could wield either diabolical or fantastic powers. Seeking this extraordinary power, three felines by the name of the Sisters Pris wreak all kinds of havoc to obtain them. This trio has at its every whim a band of ruthless kittens (the Black Cats Gang), whose mischief is notorious among the lands of the dog-people.   Enter Waffle, a police-officer mutt whose day off is ruined by a random attack from the vile Black Cats Gang. Like the good dog cop that he is, Waffle crashes into the scene with his mighty robotic vehicle to set things straight. Ahem...although the plot isn't that stunning, the game is involving enough to entertain those gamers who love cute, platform style games with quirky characters. The more aged gamer, however, will most likely require a little more complexity than this.  Gameplay As a cop dog in a robot, your tasks involve wandering around short levels with the aim of capturing and sending pesky kittens back to headquarters. Keeping you on your toes all the while are confrontations with the three Pris Sisters, who always have some strange contraption with which they do battle. The levels are made up of very linear goals, and interesting bosses, but unfortunately, there is not much more to the main focus of most levels than capturing cats. It's amusing, but it's rather shallow.   When Waffle isn't busy catching cats, several areas are available for him to explore and people in them to meet. The scenes add a peculiar pace to the game, often turning the gameplay into a cartoon, and requiring less and less gameplay and more and more listening. The RPG elements are interesting for awhile, but usually the information is rather useless in regard to solving the level. Sometimes Waffle meets up with his grandfather, and at others he tries to figure out why the Black Cat Gang is doing what it does, but either way it's a mixed bag of interesting exploration and rather boring conversations. The good voice acting helps, but it often feels like there's more to listen to than there is to explore.   Still, when there is fighting action, it's thick and fun. The Pris Sisters' kittens swarm the levels like a viral infection, and it's up to you to beat and capture them. The unusual robotic vehicle Waffle pilots is capable of many tasks, many of which are innovative and surprising. For example, in fights against many of the bosses, you can use the standard attacks, and if you're really good, you can catch the boss' projectiles and throw them back. You'll need to use all of the contraption's features to attain the goals set before you. And like any platformer, there is lots of jumping (that goes without saying, right?). But instead of punching or hopping on your foes, you have to either catch them with your long robotic arms, or use the strange bubble ability to either destroy or encase them.   As you go from stage to stage in hopes of tracking down the three Pris Sisters and their impish minions, you'll come across numerous red starred blocks. While collecting these pictures to your photograph inventory adds a little depth, the attempt at solid replay value doesn't make up for rather linear and sometimes simplistic gameplay.  Tail Concerto has lots of good voice acting, a light-hearted tone, numerous environments, and a cute atmosphere, but because it's a hybrid between action/adventure and even RPG elements, it's hard to think of this as a long game. As a platformer, it's kind of short, but as either an adventure or an RPG, it's extremely short.   Precise control of the vehicle can sometimes be difficult with either the analog or digital functions. Controlling Waffle takes practice; it certainly doesn't feel as flexible as it should.  During the mine cart and flying levels (must every action/adventure have a mind cart level?), the control is without flaw, but maneuvering on land and even on your own can be hazardous. Performing a running jump can feel awkward, and stopping on a dime is impossible.   The one part where it truly becomes entertaining is the end. There are loads of anime video that illustrate the strange, yet predictable plot change, and gameplay itself takes a turn for the better.  But that leads me to ask, why didn't the creators incorporate these aspects all the way through?  Graphics If nothing else, Tail Concerto is visually pleasing in all aspects.  The graphics are detailed to perfection, and the cartoonish appearance flawlessly captures a unique mood and look. Atlus' game is completely smothered and wrapped with tender care as far as its appearance is regarded, and it shines with brilliant force.   Packed with both realtime and hand-drawn cutscenes, Tail Concerto's production quality is nicely well rounded. From level to level, each environment is heaped with bright and numerous color-filled landscapes.  Snowy regions are blanketed with white powdery snow textures, while forested lands are covered in dense foliage.  From the inside of a mechanical weapons factory to the main square of a bustling town, well animated and large graphics all look wonderfully detailed and appealing to the eye. Sound The music fits the style of play with impeccable precision. Tunes will keep things jogging along no matter in which place you happen to be, and although they're not amazing beyond belief, they set a feel for the surroundings.   As the story continues, the text translation becomes curiously awkward, and more often than not poor incorporation of the voice samples makes for a painfully wincing experience. While the voice itself had no errors, the placement of the speech was odd. For example, Waffle would be talking to his grandfather, and instead of saying what he should, one of his grandfather's samples would play. These are not critical mistakes, but they could have been avoided.   The spoken dialogue is very well done (the exception to the aforementioned exceptions), and each character has perfectly matching enthusiasm, no matter whether that particular one is supposed to sound enthusiastic or not.  And there's a truckload of it! Almost every significant dog-thingy or cat-person you run into has something to say, and chances are that he or she will have a small conversation with you.   As far as effects themselves go, the kittens' squeals go along with their fears of being captured, Waffle's actions attach themselves to worthy noises, and so on.  Take your hand off the volume control, because there's nothing to fret about here.Beyond the cute exterior of Tail Concerto lies a fun game that is just too short for its own good.  Great graphics and sound effects manage to make it entertaining, but there isn't enough to attract a huge audience outside of young gamers.  How short is it? It's childsplay compared to what it could have been!  Had it been longer, it would have been much more enjoyable, and perhaps could have struck a wider variety of customers. As it lies, it's a questionable buy, and an easy rental.", "date": "Nov 10, 1999"}
