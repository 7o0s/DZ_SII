Being able to place a cinderblock on a teetering plank and have it react realistically was something that few games had been able to present effectively. Switchball follows in this same vein by giving players a world driven solely by physics and what you can do with those physics to get to the end of the stage. You'll have to think creatively and precisely to succeed, and while Switchball may not be for everyone, if you have an interest in meticulous puzzlers then it should be right up your alley.   As with any puzzler Switchball begins easy enough with a quick introduction to the mechanics of the world. There are five environments in all with six levels to play in each. While the environments themselves sound more diverse--with names like Sky World, Ice World, and Lava World--they're actually a bit too similar in their design. The levels all feel very familiar once you've gotten through the majority of them, even if the game does do a good job of populating them with new objects and materials to mess around with, the underlying construct is generally the same.   When the lights go out on Switchball.  If you couldn't tell by the name ~Switchball~ you'll be commanding a rolling sphere (fancy phrase for ball) in order to traverse from one end of a stage to the other. The thing that differentiates the game from the rest of the ball-centric crop of puzzle XBLA games is that you have different forms that you can take in order to succeed. Throughout the play experience you'll be able to utilize an Air Ball which makes you lighter, a Metal Ball which magnetizes you and makes you heavier, as well a few other forms (we haven't mentioned the coolest) that we'll let you find for yourself. In your way are obstacles like cloth that can only be stepped on if you're lighter than your standard form, magnets that will suck you in if you happen to be made of metal, and fans that will push you off of a ledge if you're too light. Utilizing these different powers is a huge part of the fun factor of the game and is surprisingly effective once you get passed the first few, slightly mundane levels.   Despite the fact that Switchball's five environments feel similar at a macro level, the action feels fresh in each by introducing new forms for your ball to take, which means that you'll have to learn how to advance using your new ability. Not only that but the obstacles in each level stay nice and varied with new switches, swinging pendulums, and railways that need to be traversed.    The single player will take you a handful of hours to run through, and to supplement that experience--as well as to justify dropping 800 Microsoft Points--Switchball also includes the requisite online offering. There are two ways to take the game online: two-player cooperative and a competitive race with up to eight players; sadly there's no local multiplayer available. There are four levels for each mode and they all differentiate themselves nicely from what is seen in the solo game. The co-op is especially interesting as it presents several situations where you and a buddy need to do things like strategically press switches to advance or coerce a metal ball down a series of shoots using innovative teamwork.   The real star of Switchball throughout the entire experience, online or off, is the physics system. Everything behaves realistically with speed, mass, inertia, and the characteristics of the materials around you must to be taken into account to progress.     But just as soon as you think the game is without that one fatal flaw that strikes to the heart of every awesome play experience, you mess with the camera, and therein lies this game's kryptonite. So many third-person perspective games get the camera wrong, and while Switchball's is decent there are far too many situations when it gets stuck behind pieces of the environment or is just plain tough to maneuver to get the proper vantage point. There's the option to have the AI take the reins of the camera, but that doesn't work all that well either as you'll likely feel more constricted than with the free roaming camera.   As we said earlier the environments don't differ that much in their general structure, but where they do vary quite a bit is in their visual presentations. They're lit differently, colored differently, and each has a solid personality because of that. While the graphics in Switchball won't blow the doors off your neighbor's house, they do a good job at presenting an attractive world. Reflections are well done, with the metal ball showing everything in the surrounding world just as it should. The only true issue that we found in the aesthetics of the game was that v-sync was turned off for no real reason. There's a good amount of tearing in the game and with as slow moving a title as Switchball we don't really see the need for it.Theres no doubt that Switchball is worth your hard-earned Microsoft Points if youre into puzzlers. It offers an innovative look at ball-centric XBLA games with its different abilities that stay fresh throughout the five separate environments. The multiplayer and single-player come together to provide for hours of enjoyment, now if only the camera were a bit more forgiving. It has its faults, but for 800 Microsoft Points you could certainly do much worse.", "date": "Nov 8, 2007"}
