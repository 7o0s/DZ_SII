This follow up fixes many of the things that gamers had a problem with in the original BattleTanx game, namely graphics. It seems this improvement wasn't enough for the folks at 3DO since they went ahead an jacked up the overall speed of the game and added a fine two player cooperative mode. All of this adds up to an improved ~battle tanking~ experience but in the case of the game's increased speed, perhaps they should've left well enough alone.  Gameplay Modes:   Hold 'em - In this single or multi-player mode of play, one queen is in a central location on the battlefield.  The first team to rescue her, return her to their fortress, then defend her for a set amount of time wins. Tank Wars- In this single or multi-player mode of play, players have teams of tanks that battle for three minutes. At the end of the battle whoever has the most kills wins. Convoy - In this single or multi-player mode of play, the objective is for one player to protect a fleet of tanks while the opponent tries to obliterate the convoy of tanks. Frenzy - In this single or multi-player mode of play, the objective is to capture Queenlords on a certain level. The first player to touch ten Queens wins. Deathmatch - In this single or multi-player mode of play, the objective is to be the first army to have a set number of kills. BattleLord - In this single or multi-player mode of play, the objective is to rescue the opposing gang's Queen Lord and then return her to your home base. The enemy will be trying to capture your Queen Lord at the same time, which makes this a game of intense action as well as battle tactics.  Campaign - In this single player mode of play, the game player will experience the BattleTanx II story.  The Campaign consists of (17) seventeen action-packed levels with graphic illustrations and full motion video sequences that bring to life the BattleTanx II story line throughout the game.  Family Mode- This is an alternative style of Deathmatch play, where you have unlimited main cannon ammo, and power-ups are automatically armed in sequence when you pick them up. Power-up weapons are used in preference to your main cannon. Single button contol is utilized; all weapons are fired from the Z Button.      The Vehicles  The Rattler--Built for speed and uses gattling gun as primary weapon. The M1A1--Your basic tank that balances speed, attack and toughness. The Goliath--Slow, heavily armored behemoth with the familiar cannon that rocks. The Hovertank--Slides over any terrain and uses dual turbo fans for propulsion. The Hornet--Uses twin rocket launchers as primary weapon. The Marksman--Uses laser as primary weapon. The Inferno--Uses flamethrower as primary weapon. The Rhino--Lots of heavy armor on the front but slow and vulnerable to rear attacks. The Mototank--Super quick runabout with dual machine guns that can't take any kind of beating. The M2 Hydra--Turret has dual cannons with alternating firing pattern.  The Flip E Tank--Very evasive tank with rolling/strafe maneuver.    The Story In the year 2002 the world has turned into a diseased, post-apocalyptic wastelands. As the human race struggles to rebuild society, a young boy who possesses rare tele-kinetic abilities holds the key to a better world. However, an evil QueenLord wants this boy's powers for her own so that she may destroy what is left of civilization. Using a variety of tanks and weapons, players must rescue this powerful child from the hands of evil and deliver him into the safe arms of the allies. Only then can peace be restored upon the land.  Gameplay It's all about destruction in Global Assault because of the cool new explosion effects. Not that it's  necessarily a big part of the game, but blowing up buildings will give you a lot of satisfaction as you watch the all of the building's windows light up and the whole thing appears to jump up before it crumbles to bits. Because you'll be battling in great cities of the world this time around, you'll have to be careful not to blow up the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, if you're into national landmarks that is. If you don't give a damn about the White House then by all means don't hesitate to tear the roof off of that mother.  The specifics of gameplay are tied to the variety of tanks you'll be using, which are tied to the specific team you choose to battle with. We mentioned speed could be a problem in Global Assualt. It's not often that we say that a game has too much speed but there are some vehicles in this game that are pretty much too fast for their own good. The Rattler, Mototank and Hovertank are extremely difficult to control and master. Not that it can't be done, but you will definitely have to apply yourself to get your timing down.  With those three tanks you'll have no problem zipping around getting where you need to go, but lining up a shot is one of the toughest things to do. Likewise, because of their speed, they were made extremely fragile and can't take much punishment. With the Hovertank, it's as big as the regular tanks and makes a nice target for someone that's far away who may think you're driving a Rhino. The little tanks don't seem to be too good at anything other than getting blown up when you're trying to engage any enemies. However there is a reason for every tank in the game and you'll really need that speed when you're playing missions or head to head matches where you need to move in, pick up something and get out quickly. For the multiplayer matches though you can't use these very often since nobody will show you any mercy as you oversteer and fly by your opponent out of control. And when you use the turbo powerup with those vehicles....forget about it.    Fans of the game will be familiar with the team format from the last game, where certain teams will have specific group of tanks at their disposal  and access to certain weapons when they battle. Griffin's Army for example is the default team and you will have the M1A1, The Hovertank, the Goliath and the Marksman available. In the case of the Hovertank, you're best bet is to move in quickly avoiding shots and use the old point-blank method where you unload on the enemy as much as possible before you get destroyed. And you will be destroyed too with the Hovertank's flimsy armor. All of the tanks and weapons in Global Assault are very well balanced so as not to give huge advantages to any one player. This is truly a strength of the game.  The great equalizer in the game is the Nuke. Rolling that giant barrel out there is one of the most satisfying experiences on the N64. This is because you never know when you'll be lucky enough to find one, even if you're using the team that specializes in them, and the thing turns the entire screen yellow and wreaks havoc on everything whether friend or foe. This highly recommended.  Multiplayer Modes The multiplayer modes are even more fun than last year. We'll say you're guaranteed to get into any multiplayer match using any of the modes mentioned above. The one situation you should avoid is a four player match where everybody is using one of the three quick tanks. Just avoid it for you own good. Spending time inside of a blender would be less hectic than this madness.  There's a little repetition with some of the modes. With Battle Lord and Hold 'Em you've got to do the same thing basically but one gives you an extra little challenge. We enjoyed all of the modes with the exception of Convoy. Not that it is poorly done, it's just that when you've got so many other cool gameplay options, protecting some slacker convoy of super slow trucks is a pain in the butt. When you have to do in the campaign it's the level you finish quickly enough.   With all of the new weapons like the more comprehensive guided missile and the Jumping Betties --a fine jumping mine that shoots lasers-- the multiplayer games may end being more of a showcase of who can use weapons the best rather than an all out war. You won't get by just using the basic default guns on each tank. Finding, picking up and appropriately applying the variety of powerups provides endless layers of strategy for the serious Global Assault player, while those who play conservatively will make nice fodder.   The two player campaign mode is a nice addition to a game that was already fun. It's more or less you and a friend running through accomplishing the tasks that you'd normally have to do by yourself. The drones are a little more plentiful and a little more aggressive since there's two of you to deal with. Oh and you have to be sure not to shoot each other if you want to advance.  Sound The sound is improved over last year's game but still nothing outstanding. The music is nice and  post-apocalyptic but nothing you'd ever want to buy. Still it fits the mood of the game and doesn't take anything away from the overall fun of the game.  There's still no extra voice sampling or chatter from computer opponents. Instead of that woman announcing  ~power up~ every time you pick up a goodie, you get a strange hydraulic ratchet sound.  The lack of voice may be due to the fact there will be so many explosions and other bangs and booms going on when the action heats up. These are all done very well and tend to match the visuals of the explosions  Graphics Very impressive. Not only is BattleTanx Global Assault better looking than its predecessor but it moves even better. The tanks all have more detail and look more like the war machines you'd expect from a futuristic society trying to stay alive. In the missions where the tanks are painted one color, it's not the same schlocky green or blue that you saw last year. Now the paint looks dry and cool and you can even make out the logos of the different teams in the game. The griffin for Griffin's Army looks crisp and sharp and stays that way as you move around the battlefield.   The framerate is silky smooth especially in the one player modes. When you bump up the number of players even with all kinds of enemies and special effects going on the screen the game continues on smooth enough to keep enjoying it. This is truly an accomplishment for 3DO considering all of the things, both seen and unseen, that can be going at any given time.   The game is all about destruction so you know fire is an important part of the graphic content. There's lots of it and it looks marvelous. The flamethrower on the Inferno is a great example of how well this team has nailed down fire. This is the same company that likes to burn teddy bears in their ads so they've got to be good at it.  We knew Global Assault back when it was still BattleTanx II and we liked it then. So when the final version came out looking sharper and moving smoother we couldn't help but be impressed. From the new tanks to the new powerups to the new battle modes, this game improved in nearly every area over the original and as we said, BattleTanx was a pretty fun game. Even with Vigilante 8: Second Offense on the way, Global Assault is a nice choice for you vehicle combat game of the fall. Pick it up, invite your friends over and be sure to have plenty of snacks for the party that ensues. One word of warning, though. We're very serious about avoiding those super fast tanks, because it drove us absolutely nuts trying to get the hang of it. We're not saying that you're going so fast that you can dodge bullets. What we're saying is, when you're good enough at this game and using powerups, you won't have to.  Global Assault can't compare to a giant quest of a game like Jet Force Gemini, but for the vehicular combat genre, you can't do much better than this improved sequel to an already strong franchise.", "date": "Oct 14, 1999"}
