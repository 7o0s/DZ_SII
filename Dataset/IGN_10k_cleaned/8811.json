And by 'untimely demise', I mean 'flying through the windshield, crunching down the road'. This is FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, a game that - like the previous titles in the series - doesn't put you behind the wheel of a gleaming, highly tuned, blinged up street racer from the off, instead starting you out in the sticks, racing derby cars that would look more at home at the wrecking yard than in the showroom.   Even if you're a car whore you'll no doubt appreciate this approach. Not only is it a fantastic introduction to the game's handling and down and dirty racing style, but it means that when you've worked your way through the derby class and on to the racing class and beyond, you've actually earned the right to use the higher performance cars. First things first, however; some introductions.     If you've never played the FlatOut games before, that's cool, they're not as well-known as the Burnouts of the world, but they certainly have their charm, and Ultimate Carnage is a great place to start. It's basically a next-gen reworking of FlatOut 2, but this isn't a lazy redux, this is a complete overhaul. In the past the series could never really lay claim to being one of the prettiest racers around - the visuals had a rough edge that actually complemented the style of racing quite well, but that's all changed for FlatOut's inaugural 360 outing. It's now quite the looker, with a great sensation of speed and a number of crisp, detailed environments. Thankfully it also offers up a pretty decent single player challenge and robust online play.   As I mentioned before, in the game's main event - FlatOut mode, the game starts you off in the derby class. As is the way with racing games, you're given some token cash at the beginning of the game, and a small selection of derby class vehicles to choose from. Any cash you earn can be spent on a whole host of upgrades to your motorised shopping trolley of death, and as you progress you'll unlock more cars that you can purchase. So far so standard, right? Where FlatOut distinguishes itself is in its career structure and its reward system. Simply put, winning the multi-event tournaments that the game offers you is only one way to earn cash. There's a whole reward structure based around kicking ass during the races. Every time you do a number of things, such as slam another racer or ram someone hard enough to completely wreck their car, the game tallies it up. Not only do you get cash rewards for combative moves during the races, a number of awards are also given at the end of each race - Best Wrecker, Blast Master, Fastest Lap and Bulldozer, each of which comes with its own cash prize. Special mention must go to the Bulldozer award which rewards the player who drives through the most scenery. That wouldn't mean a great deal in most racing games, but FlatOut is somewhat special in this regard. More on that later.   The point is that Ultimate Carnage goes out of its way to reward you for aggressive driving tactics. In fact, you could cruise through the entire game on second and third place finishes and still earn enough cash to buy and upgrade the vehicles you want, simply by driving like a maniac.      FlatOut mode is comprised of sets of events to try and win, but that's not all. For every GP, you can also unlock a bonus event, whether it's a destruction derby or a time trial. Each of these comes with cash prizes too, so you're constantly earning money and upgrading your vehicle, and it's not long before even your derby class car is feeling less like a brick with wheels, and more like a lean mean racing machine. Ultimate Carnage has three car classes - derby, race and street, each of which has a large set of tournaments, and you don't have to finish derby off to move on to the race events; you just have to buy yourself a race class car.    The feel of the game fundamentally changes as you move through the car classes - obviously the racing gets faster and faster, but as you move up through derby and into the race class, you'll find yourself with much more precise control. Whereas at the start of the game it can sometimes be a battle just to keep your car on the course, requiring deft use of the brake to get around corners, it's not long before you're flying along, handbraking around corners with impunity. Then you move on to the street cars, which bring their own challenge to the fore - they're light and fast, making it very easy to lose traction and spin out of control. The changes in handling, however, aren't necessarily for the best; I definitely preferred the feel of the early game, fighting to get the most out of the slower derby cars and eke out a first or second before it falls apart.    Even so, the AI provides a pretty good challenge throughout, and coming first is very rarely assured. More often than not you're only near the top spot throughout the race, battling to get ahead of the sometimes superhuman-feeling AI. This can be a little frustrating, but makes getting a good hit in, or watching one of the other drivers career off course, all the more satisfying. It's also mediated by an overall lenience on the player. Sure, it might be next to impossible to come first on a certain course with a certain vehicle, but you don't need to. As I said before, you can cruise through the tournaments by coming third overall, which, because you're in a field of 12, means that you could be coming fifth or sixth in half the events, as long as you place well in the other half. And of course, you can re-try each event until you've achieved the result you want anyway (which is definitely a good thing - Ultimate Carnage has a tendency to somehow screw you over when in sight of the finish line). The end result is a game with enough content to keep you racing for days if not weeks, but that won't necessarily prove to be a massive challenge along the way. Unless you're determined to come first in every single event.     Ultimate Carnage has a pretty wide array of environments to blaze through. Suiting the early game well, you'll race through farmlands and along massive stormwater drains, but as you gradually get behind the wheels of more sophisticated vehicles, the environment also change, throwing in an array of city courses with gleaming skyscrapers, winding freeways and construction sites. The course design is pretty good on the whole, but some settings definitely have more personality and better racing lines than others. We weren't huge fans of the desert courses or the aircraft graveyard for instance, and some of the courses are definitely better suited to particular vehicle classes.   It's not the course design or crisp visuals that will jump out at you the first time you play Ultimate Carnage mind you. It's the debris. Simply put, this game has more detritus than the apocalypse. Almost anything smaller than a house in this game is fair game for you to send flying. Hell, most races open with the pack knocking down the billboard above the start line. And from there it just gets silly, with literally thousands of physics objects on every course. It's not uncommon for there to be so many tyres, twisted bits of girder, signs, fence palings and traffic cones scattered about that you can barely even see the course. The previous games had this aspect, but Bugbear has really cranked it up to 11 on 360. And there's no doubt it's pretty cool watching literally forty or fifty tyres bouncing all over the track as the entire field ploughs into a barrier. It's less cool when you clip an object on the track the wrong way and get sent flying, but thankfully that doesn't happen all that often. Best of all though, all the outdoor settings, chainlink fences, watermelons, hay bales, logs, boulders, street lights, tractors and more actually play a role in the gameplay too. The more crap you run into, the more nitrous you get, which makes Blues Brothers-style detours through shops or warehouses all the more rewarding. Nitrous is also gained by ramming into other racers and catching air. Again, it all ties into driving aggressively. And the more nitrous you earn, the more you can use it to take out your opponents.      As you'd expect, Ultimate Carnage has plenty of online functionality baked right in. After every race your time or score is ranked on a worldwide leader board, which gives you an extra incentive to shave precious seconds off every lap. And of course, you can compete against other players online, whether in single races, race tournaments or in the zany mini-games. A word to the wise though - don't bother with open car class races; this game is a whole lot more fun when everyone's evenly matched and not careening out of control because they chose the fastest vehicle on the menu.   The other major mode in this game is Ultimate Carnage, a collection of single events which bring together destruction derbies, races and explosive time trials with a variety of ragdoll-launching mini-games. As entertaining as the idea of launching your driver through the windshield at a giant dart board or mechanised baseball bat may sound, chances are you'll quickly label them 'gimmicky' and return to the racing. That's what we did. Still, a nice bonus nonetheless, and you can easily set up a party game tournie with friends after a night out at the pub.All in all, Ultimate Carnage is a breath of fresh air on the 360 racing scene. Were huge fans of its blend of high speed racing and duelling, especially the way youre rewarded for more than just where you place in the pack. That said, we did find that repeating some of the weaker courses over and over became a bit of a grind, and that the game lost some of its distinctive personality in the later car classes. Still, FlatOut deserves your attention.", "date": "Jul 23, 2007"}
