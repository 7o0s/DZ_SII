But while wanting to scream as you simultaneously pull your hair out and snap your controller in half could be found in several NES titles, few adventures so perfectly packaged the pain as Capcom's Ghosts 'N Goblins. It was so tough that it required true dedication and a lack of common sense to master its madness, as time and time again your hero found himself reduced to a dead and dormant stack of bones.   The adventure tells of Arthur, a knight in shining armor who sets out across a somewhat-cartoonish land of horrors to rescue the kidnapped Princess, Prin-Prin. Unfortunately for her, Arthur doesn't have many skills to save her. He's a hero whose only abilities are to run, jump and duck, as well as to throw his current weapon either directly left or directly right. Additionally, he takes two hits before dying -- the first removes his armor, leaving him exposed and in his underwear, while the second kills him outright. Sure, he can find an upgrade to restore his plate mail if he's lost it, but that collectible appears so rarely that you may never see it show up at all. Arthur's a restricted warrior, friends.   This massive Cyclops is no match for my many dinky daggers! These gameplay limitations can sometimes be oppressive. Arthur runs, crouches and jumps incredibly stiffly, with no fluidity at all to his movements. Plus he can't change directions in mid-air after he jumps (as he could do in later sequels), so you'd better hope that you placed his leap well before hitting the A Button.   The enemies are much more mobile, swooping down in diving arcs, carving sinusoidal waves in the air or rushing straight at you head-on -- it's nearly impossible to dodge some of them, so you have to hope a well-timed strike with your flying lance, torch or dagger will do them in. Many foes take multiple hits, though, and will plow right through your assault to kill you anyway. And even worse are the parts of the game with no enemies at all, but moving platforms instead. That locked-in jumping style that forces Arthur to commit to the initial direction of any leap turns out to be maddening when crossing bottomless pits, and there are enough of those scattered throughout the quest's six levels that you'll certainly be seeing Arthur tumble into quite a few before the end of the journey.   One thing that does help to counterbalance Ghosts 'N Goblins intense challenge is its unlimited continues, which let you start over again and again on the same stage even if you get a Game Over. And most of the levels have mid-stage checkpoints, too, so you aren't thrown all the way back to the beginning when you fall. Still, be warned that even with those helpful elements in place, Ghosts 'N Goblins is a truly difficult game that will very likely cause you more frustration than fun.In future installments, we've praised Arthur's adventures as difficult, but addictively fun -- which they are. Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts are solid games, and are definitely worth your consideration. But this first stab at being knightly is more difficult and potentially frustrating than the other titles combined. Check out the 16-bit installments first and see how you like them. Then, if you truly enjoy the challenge they offer and want more, come back to this one -- just remember to take slow breaths between every continue.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
