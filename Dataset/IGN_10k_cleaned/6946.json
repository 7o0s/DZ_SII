The Cabela franchise has finally made the jump from console to handheld with Cabela's Dangerous Hunts: Ultimate Challenge. If the title sounds familiar, it's because Cabela's Dangerous Hunts actually shipped in 2003 for consoles. This new version, Ultimate Challenge, takes the console version and adds a few mobile-friendly modes. But for the most part, the console and handheld titles share everything from specific animal types and gear to a near-identical hunting system.   That's good news for fans of the series. But for anyone looking for a revamped version of the console version then Ultimate Challenge definitely isn't it. It doesn't really change much or add anything in terms of PSP exclusives. Developers tweaked the control scheme to make it run, so that's good.  Apart from that and a slightly modified 'quick action' mode, nothing here really appeals to owners of the console version. Having said that, if you want a portable hunting game, there's not much choice out there.   Also, Ultimate Challenge takes a far more action-oriented approach to hunting. More so than other games in the Cabela series, at any rate. True aficionados of virtual hunting will most likely find this to be a negative thing. And honestly, it just doesn't feel like your old-fashioned Cabela game. Hunting, more than anything, is about strategy and patience. And here, it's simply way too fast. The system isn't entirely broken, of course, but it serves to note that Ultimate Challenge doesn't play like earlier games in the series. Now, if you want a handheld first-person shooter with bears and wolves to shoot at, then this may be your type of game.   The whole thing splits between two modes. The first, Story Mode, weaves a standard tale of peril and rescue. You need to visit a bunch of different locations, blast the hell out of 20 or so different kinds of animals, and then ultimately rescue an old friend from the clutches of nature. It's a dull story, as far plot goes. But that's to be expected from a game were you spend most of the time pumping birds and bears full of buckshot. Still, it does lend the game some structure, and it's somewhat entertaining. Of course, it does have a few issues. Your AI partners, for instance, are the dumbest human beings on the face of the Earth. When presented with danger, they mostly just act as walking meals. They often refuse to shoot or fight. Not good.  The second mode, Quick Action, has more than a dozen missions you can play without having to deal with burdens of narrative. This mode is definitely one of the best parts of the game, as it lets you hunt in short bursts under a variety of terrain. You can try almost everything Ultimate Challenge has to offer by just playing through most of these modes. You can try everything from sniping inside a helicopter to blasting dingos with shotguns. You can also try vanquishing African elephants with handguns, though it doesn't work too well. It's still damn funny, though, and IGN strongly suggests that you try it.   Ultimate Challenge doesnt really offer anything different from the console version. Having said that, it does let hardcore fans of the series take their virtual hunting to go. But theres a good chance that some of these fans wont like the revamped, action-oriented pacing very much.", "date": "Jun 1, 2006"}
