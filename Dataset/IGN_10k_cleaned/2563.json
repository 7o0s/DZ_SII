Handled by gaming giants Capcom and later Virgin Interactive, the license that Walt built was an imaginative treasure trove of gameplay delight.   Whether it was Duck Tales, Aladdin, or Castle of Illusion, if you had yourself a Disney title you knew you were in for something special. In the latter days of 32, 64, and even 128-bit however, finding a quality Mickey Mouse offering is about as likely as the wicked stepsisters becoming runway fashion models. Too bad that that statement still rings true with Disney Interactive's latest character romp, Peter Pan in Return to Never Land.   Gameplay Similar to just about every platformer-on-rails that you've played before, Return to Never Land doesn't offer anything fresh at all. Confined to the easily beaten stages, Peter Pan flies around the enclosed areas at a sluggish pace while swiping too-stupid A.I. foes with the greatest of ease. Despite the somewhat unresponsive movement of the world's oldest boy-warrior, slashing the bajeezus out your dim-witted opponents is way too simplistic. I do realize that this one is aimed towards younger children, but I have to wonder how long they can take the sparse combat environment before shutting everything off. ~Boring~ is probably the best way to describe it.   Maybe the game would be fun if only the developers had done a little bit more in terms of things to do. The barren battlefields find your Pan swooping too and from chasms, jungles, and other such locales with little else to do. Birds, fish, and the occasional wimpy boss character pop in now and then to try and stop your progress, but their easy-to-remember patterns are overcome in no time.   There are supposedly other obstacles to reach, like collecting feathers, solving puzzles, and pressing switches, but doing all this while staying interested is the real challenge at hand. Playing as Tinkerbell may excite some of you out there, but what's so cool about flying around keeping a torch lit? That's right nothing.   Graphics Graphically Peter Pan fares a bit better, with impressively designed backdrops and colorful levels throughout. Peter himself looks mighty good, with some sweet animations that aren't too shabby and a style straight out of the Disney cinema. Night-based stages especially are worth mentioning and the clean presentation helps to sell the cartoon inspiration. Now if only Peter's foes were as nicely animated as he is.   The cut scenes aren't that great, with clunky and poorly directed film breaks reeking of amateurism. Sparkle, break-up, and a myriad of other classic PlayStation video problems seem to rise from their graves to haunt every short without mercy. And God help us what about those load times?   Attacking in killer bee-like formation, the constant loading between stages, films, and overworld maps is so prevalent, that you will literally spend a third of the time used in defeating the game waiting for it to appear in the first place. Not a cool way to spend your evening.   Sound My favorite aspect of Return to Never Land is probably the music. Taken right out of the movies, every tune is instantly recognizable and fitting to whatever situation that Peter is thrust into. Underplayed to an annoying degree it's a shame that the score wasn't a stronger focus of the game, it might have helped.   Vocals on the other hand are a mixed bag. While Smee and Captain Hook are surprisingly convincing, Peter Pan is horrible. Worse than Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker speeches, listening to our games hero spout off like a scared little kid is enough to drive a man to drink. Luckily for us, most television sets have a convenient volume switch. Ah, much better. Taking it for what it is, Peter Pan in Disney's Return to Never Land may be enough for the younger sect to use up one of their free rentals at Blockbuster, but for the rest of us trudging through a game we've seen a million times before (and done better at that) isn't worth even a stitch of our time.
