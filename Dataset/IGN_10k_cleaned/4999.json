After downing about four PBRs and a basket of onions rings, I felt that I was in the right state of mind to really get down some bowling action and, to my surprise, I actually enjoyed playing Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling.   Circuit Pro Bowling is your basic bowling simulation with a few nice extras.  For instance, you can create your own professional bowler or pick from one of several genuine pro bowlers included in the game.  THQ has included video player bios so you can learn a bit about each before playing as or against them.  However, these bios are really just about talking smack, like when Ricky Ward tells you, ~Guys with lots of titles don't scare me, I eat them for lunch.~  There are six types of gameplay (including exhibition, skins, and tournament) as well as a multiplayer mode.  Multiplay allows up to six players to compete on a network or the Internet and you can even play on Mplayer for free.  But I think one of the coolest modes is Cosmic Bowling (also referred to as 'Midnight Bowling' at some alleys).  In this mode, the standard flourescent lights have been replaced with black-lites and you toss your orange day-glo ball at neon pins.  Very trippy.     All bowling variables and physics are re-created accurately in Circuit Pro Bowling.  Pin movement appears accurate and you can adjust the amount of spin you want on the ball, effectively changing the arc of the ball as it speeds down the lane.  Players can choose from one of six balls and can switch balls for each throw.  Throwing the ball is controlled in a similar manner to several of the golf games on the market with a rising power and accuracy bar which players must stop at the appropriate point with a click of their mouse.   The graphics in Circuit Pro Bowling are fairly bland and uninspired, with the on-looking crowd never making a move.  It's like the spectators have just been painted on the walls.  But the excellent soundtrack in Circuit Pro Bowling ranges from funky fuzz guitar jams that remind me of Interstate '76 to AC/DC inspired heavy-metal licks.  Although it sounds clear and actually made my booty shake a few times while playing, this may not be the kind of music your average bowling enthusiast has in their collection.  The sound effects are extremely sparse and consist mainly of pin noises and polite clapping.  Ongoing game commentary or even a hearty ~Hell Yeah!!!~ after you make a strike would have added to the bowling experience.    Overall, Circuit Pro Bowling is a mildly entertaining game.  About the only part of the bowling experience that it lacks is the funny lookin' shoes and it does offer a nice diversion from the slew of ultra-violence so prevalent in video games today.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 14, 1998"}
