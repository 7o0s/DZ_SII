And so begins Black Stone: Magic & Steel, the latest Gauntlet knock off, this time from Xicat Interactive.  While it's no shocker that the plot is nothing we haven't seen in 99% of all adventure/action games, I was sort of hoping for some originality to be lurking somewhere within the confines of this rather sizable game.  And I'm proud to announce -- err, well, I really didn't find any.  Features 1-4 players go at it Gauntlet style 26 levels packed with nasty monsters Easy to learn control system Lots of unlockables Ride a dinosaur and snack on the baddies In Stereo  Gameplay Known as Ex-Chaser in Japan, Black Stone has a deep story -- according to the tiny print stuffed into the manual.  In gameplay, however, the story is told minimally between each level.  With a static screen, small text scrolls by quickly while an obtuse voice drones out a history lesson.  In the end, with a game like this, the story is relatively inconsequential, but the presentation of that story could have been a lot better.  Gauntlet all over again Black Stone lets one to four players play on a single Xbox (no split-screen worries), a la Gauntlet.  In fact, just about everything in the game is reminiscent of the party game classic.   You choose one of several classes of character to play.  You've got enemies who spawn endlessly from ~huts~, which you must destroy to stop them from swarming your party.  You pick up magic scrolls (as opposed to potions), which offer powerful blasts.  You've got both a ranged and a melee attack.  You open chests for goodies and often you'll be yelling at your buddy that you need that food health pick-up more than they do.  That's not to say Black Stone doesn't try and throw in a few wrinkles of its own.  There are some pretty cool power-ups you can nab that will affect your melee and ranged attacks.  Like a triple ranged attack and Berserker rage that causes 50% more damage for a limited time.  But these wrinkles are no kind of innovation and are rather just an extra coat of paint on a genre in need of some inspiration.    Control Controls are fairly easy and there aren't any problems with getting your character to do what you want.  However, there's really not much they can actually do.  You've got A button for your one melee attack, X for ranged, B for magic when you have a scroll, and Y to attack another player in your party.  Yeah, you read right -- there's a button specifically devoted to hurting your buddy.  Fun!    The right trigger can be used with the face buttons for more powerful moves, which is a definite plus and the left trigger can dodge.  There's even a handy dandy map that can be toggled with the white button and you can scroll through character info with the black button.  Wake me when it's over Controls, camera, and typical problems for adventure games aren't really a concern with Black Stone.  The problem is the game just isn't very exciting.  It feels slow.  Your character moves slow, the enemies move slow, and the game itself seems like it's taking place slightly outside of our own dimension, in some place where a minute lasts 80 seconds.  Even moments where you ride on a dinosaur just aren't very exciting.  It takes a lot to make a dino ride feel pedantic, but it sure does here.    Black Stone does have some fun spots.  I mean, it's basically a slower, less exciting version of Gauntlet.  So when you pile on three friends and go adventuring it can be a bit of a hoot.  But that hooting really isn't enough to carry you through the 26 levels.    What could have saved Black Stone was some greater insanity in the levels.  Scores of enemies are cool, but adding some smart AI would have been a blast.  Instead you get a lot of foot soldiers who stand around with their jaw slack like a boy stood up at prom.  Combo moves, even ones chained by pressing the same button again and again, would have also added a bit more flavor.  In the end, Black Stone is just too ho-hum to be worthy of a smile, a laugh, or a Booyah.    Graphics There's not much visual excitement here.  The mediocre textures and the poor level design conspire against awe and amazement.  Really, there's not enough imagination in the worlds and the levels are just a variety of ~oh, this ones in a forest~ and ~ah, this is indoors~ but none of it makes you go ~Yowsa, this is the dope shizzle!~  None of the levels really promote the idea of a unique world and really don't seem to tie into the story in an integral way.  A lot of the colors blend in and the enemies don't stand out.  A perfect match for the slow & go gameplay.  Sound Xicat packed in a variety of music themes for each level, which is a good thing.  Bad part is that most of the soundtrack is actually unappealing to the ear and will cause the mute button to be hit within the first few hours of play.  The sound effects are incredibly weak fare and you get none of the charm of Gauntlet and it's ~Warrior needs food badly~ voiceovers.  It's like every effort was put into designing the game and then there just wasn't any time or money left to worry about sound. Yawn.  Good party games are hard to come by on Xbox and, unfortunately, Black Stone doesn't buck the trend in any way.  It's definitely more fun with your friends, but in the same way that eating broccoli with a saltine is better than eating the green alone.  This one might be worth a rental when your buddies are coming over for a few drinks, but it's not worth fifty large.", "date": "Mar 27, 2003"}
