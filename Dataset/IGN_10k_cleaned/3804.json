Perhaps you already own one of the previous F1 titles from EA, and you're looking for something new and different, or maybe you see that the title implies 4 seasons worth of racing and that seems like a good time to jump in.  In fact, this will be the last F1 title from EA for the PC, at least unless something changes their minds.   Is EA trying to go out with a bang or a whimper?  The answer is honestly: a little bit of both.   First, let's dispel any notions you might have regarding the feature set.  As the title clarifies, there is nothing from 2003 in this title.  There's nothing in terms of tracks, cars, or drivers you have not seen before if you've played any one of the previous years' titles.  The track changes are included, so depending upon the season, you may race either version of Hockenheim, or either version of the Nurburgring.  The cars' strengths and weaknesses are mimicked by the game.  If you drive a Williams in 1999 using Alex Zanardi, you'll find that it is well off the pace, while a current BMW-powered Williams car will put you near the front with its capabilities.     Even though the title might imply some kind of career, there is no Career Mode in this title.  You simply change the year in your driver profile, and voila, the tracks and driver list changes to reflect this.  I would not blame anyone at all for drawing the conclusion at this point that EA chose merely milk their license for the last time by repackaging 4 years worth of old stuff into a new box.  That is the risk they are taking by not introducing anything particularly career-like into the title.  There are no ~best moments~ for you to recreate on the track, no training modes or tutorials, and generally no other frills.   The things that make this title worth considering are the things that EA have done to the core title, making it stronger in many respects, while adding almost no bells and whistles. These can be summed up as improvements to the graphics and the beefing up of multiplayer.  Yes, there are physics model improvements, but the people likely to get the most out of the advanced physics are the hardcore purists who like to drive with no aids of any kind on (and you know who you are!).  For the run-of-the-mill desktop racer, who tries to leave things in some kind of default state, and sit down and run with a minimum of setup or practice laps, the game will feel much the same as last year.    In all the time I drove with and without aids, I was hard pressed to say ~Oh yeah, that's MUCH better than last year~ at any point.  If anything, with the aids off, the game is cruel and unforgiving to a fault.  Thankfully there are enough driving assists and preset difficulty levels to allow you to find a kind of comfort zone for yourself regardless of your skill (or lack thereof).   Starting with the graphics, they look much the same as they always have.  However, they are indeed better, because the average frame rate is higher.  You can have more cars on the screen, at a higher level of detail, and not see the frame rate take a nosedive. I was able to drive from the back of the grid, with all 21 other cars in front of me, and not feel that the realism was compromised by a stuttering frame rate.  Bear in mind, this was with everything on.  My computer is probably considered mid-pack, with a 1.6 Ghz Pentium and a GeForce4 Ti4400.  Given the extreme importance of a good frame rate in any kind of precision racing sim, this is to be praised.  And being the last F1 title from EA for the foreseeable future, it will only get faster with time.   Although I have some issues with the tracks, they are mainly small, and not having been to each of the tracks in real life, I can only say that from comparing them to the races I watch on Sunday, they look realistic enough to me in their design to pass for the real thing.  At any rate, I don't think there are any unrealistically wrong showstoppers here.   The cars are drop-dead gorgeous with full details on.  I have a large diecast model of a Williams F1 car (Ralf Schumacher's car) and having pulled it down to compare paint schemes and bodywork details, I came away highly impressed with the authenticity of the cars.   Weather and its appropriate graphics effects are fully enabled, with various levels of lighting and weather available.  Wet tracks behave as they should, making driving the car more difficult as the front wheels claw at the water soaked track and refuse to get the kind of traction you get in dry weather.  The weather does change somewhat, but not at any kind of alarming rate.   Force Feedback is fully supported for wheels and other controllers.  I can't say I'm overly impressed with it, as it seems little effort was made to really dial the spring rate into the grip level of the car.  It would also have been nice to get a more realistic sensation when hopping curbs in a chicane, too.  If you've ever put a racing-kart wheel on a curb while coming in fast, you know what I mean.  It can pitch the car a bit sideways (which is sometimes desirable in difficult chicanes) and wrench the wheel a bit.  But it's not in the game, sorry.  You'll get the bumpity-bump feedback effect on the curve with perhaps a little pull, but nothing that will make make you feel more like you're driving the car.  In fact, if I have a single big complaint about the handling in this title, it's that I don't feel as 'attached' to the car and the road as I feel I should, even though I know from what I do see and feel that the physics model is quite good.    The back of the box brags about the sound as if it were some kind of new feature.  It doesn't sound much different than previous versions, which is good, but not quite as nice as the sounds in, say, the PS2 version of Grand Prix Challenge, at least from within the car.   The game modes number all of 4:  Test Day, Race, Championship and Multiplayer.  That's it.  Each one does exactly what you think it does, with nothing in the way of extras.   For your 'average' PC racer, the level of detail in each mode might feel overwhelming, so EA has done some things to make your life easier.  As with last year's version, there is a 'simple' version of the setup screen that just lets you adjust 4 sliders to improve car handling.  You can adjust oversteer/understeer, softness/stiffness, acceleration/top speed, and grip/speed.   With these four settings you can at least come into the pits and tweak a bit at a time without understanding a thing about telemetry, dampers, ride heights, differential lock, and so on.  My problem with this implementation is that if you so much as go into the advanced screen to dial down the fuel load, when you come back out to the 'simple' screen, you see no slider position, only the 4 slider backgrounds with ~Custom~ written inside.  So where was the slider last?  You can't know.  Does the game make ~center~ the 'current' setup you're working on?  Or should the slider be where you left it?  Again, you don't know.  The only way to get the slider back is to click on it, and then you're back to starting from the middle, but you don't really know what your starting point was.  Not good.   Add to this the fact that ANY adjustment to fuel load causes this to happen, and this becomes a nuisance.  And what if you should adjust the wing up or down a couple of degrees?  Again, you get the ~Custom~ in the sliders, and if you choose to soften the suspension after manually tweaking the wing, you don't know whether the middle of the slider means ~where I left off~ or ~back to this setup's default~.   Although there are 5 coarse levels of difficulty which flip the various options on and off to provide an aggregate difficulty level, dialing in the right difficulty level for each individual person is nothing but trial and error.  Take a guess, do a race, Take a guess, do a race, and so on.  There is nothing in the way of adaptable AI here.  The AI is a straight percentage slider.  The 5 difficulty settings will adjust this, of course, but trying to find the right combination of realism, aids, rules and AI settings is time consuming and tedious.  The fact that you have to actually go out and experiment on the track to see just where you stand just makes it more so.  EA could definitely have broadened the appeal of their title with some 'auto-sensing' difficulty capabilities that would monitor practice laps for average time and consistency, and provided you with a few options that would give you a good challenge.  In their last NASCAR Title, Sierra has an AI option that will slowly adjust the AI difficulty percentage in real time while you're on the track, and this will be persisted across racing sessions on that track, so just by playing the game your skills and the AI skills will converge.  Not so, here.  You're on your own.   There are some nifty features, such as head panning which will turn your head to look into turns automatically the more you turn the wheel, and that works pretty good for me, although some people find it a bit disorienting.  It's a slider, as well, so you can dial it back partially or all the way, depending upon your preference.   Once you finally find the level of difficulty that's right for you, and the aids that will allow you to drive the car around the track without it spinning around on your for no discernible reason, the game comes into its own.  Running a race requires focus and commitment.  The AI aggression level is another tweakable option (with a slider, of course!), and the AI generally does a good job avoiding you even when you're side by side in a corner with them.  They will dive into openings if given them, again, based upon their personality and AI aggression level.  Even if you are loathe to tune your car at all and just want to drive default setups, you can just experiment with aids and difficulty level to find yourself a challenging race level, and it's realistic and fun to stalk someone lap after lap, drawing ever closer, and finally making the move on him to make the pass.  This is how Formula One racing really is (although admittedly their favorite method of passing is known as ~the faster pit stop~).   But again, there are just a number of small things that EA did wrong which prevent this simulation from being F1 nirvana.  The inability to accelerate time during qualifying is absolutely painful.  You have to just choose to end the session or play it out in real time.  They did add the ability to ~hop into~ another car from a camera perspective during qualifying so you can monitor your opponents as they qualify, and if this helps you or provides enjoyment, that's fine.  An option to accelerate time until some condition is met would have been great.  Imagine saying ~drop back to real time if I get knocked off the pole~, or ~If I lose 4 positions on the grid, drop to real time~.  Now that would have been a lot nicer than the all or nothing approach EA took.    If this was where the review stopped, I'd say that unless your frame rate really stunk last year, you probably aren't getting a lot for your money THIS year.  However, I have to turn to what most PC simulation racers find important: multiplayer.  If you have followed this series at all, you know that the game's multiplayer support has been a cruel joke.  After playing full grids in Grand Prix Legends and Papayrus' NASCAR 2003 (and previous versions), not having a workable F1 Multiplayer title was just awful.  And the previous efforts from EA were indeed laughable.  The cars warped all over the place with lag, adding another driver to the game would often ruin it for everyone, and the thing was just generally unplayable outside of a LAN environment.   This year, EA integrates with Gamespy from WITHIN the game, and have solved bandwidth issues by lowering the amount of data that the each client has to be able to receive from the host.  This allows for larger fields.  (I think 8 players is still all I'd want to risk on most broadband connections, but that's a lot better than the 2-3 in previous years' versions).  The warping is still there a bit, but is not as bad.  Also, the game checks for mismatched EXE files so that people who have patched their game with cracks can be found out.  The only problem is, it seems that any number of people have used the NO-CD patch that allows you to finally put your copy of the original CD on the shelf.  This doesn't affect gameplay at all, but now you can't tell the difference between a cheater and just someone who is tired of having to insert their CD everytime they play.  Every game I joined told me my EXE was mismatched, and I double and triple checked to ensure there were no patches or updates from EA.  A quick chat online revealed that it was indeed the No-CD style of patch that was causing the mismatch.   You also cannot chat in multiplayer while you're on the track, not even with hotkey combinations that would send predefined messages like ~Pitting~ to everyone else.  Bummer.  You can set the rules for your online game, forcing everyone to drive with all aids off, for instance.  However, some people online should perhaps know that traction control *IS* realistic and used in every F1 team, as well as auto-shifting, at least for upshifts.  I have had a few really sweet races online with little lag or other online hiccups to disturb me, and the replay captured it all (see images accompanying the review).     Finally, the game is definitely customizable.  Last year's title saw award winning mods like the GT-R mod, the Le Mans mod and the Ferrari 360 series mod.  Other tracks (even my beloved Laguna Seca) have been created or converted and put into the game.  Setups, paint schemes, and custom carsets are all out there for the taking, and now with online multiplayer finally a viable option, this is a no-brainer purchase for any F1 fan wanting online action to at least become doable, even though it still falls short of Sierra's NASCAR series and Grand Prix Legends in this regard.   If you're a casual driver and you're considering picking this up, ask yourself how much time you wish to spend on the game.  You'll get out of this game what you put into it.  You can't just pop it in and say ~race~ and expect everything to be great the first time out.  Most likely the AI will dust you off, and you'll probably spin your car every time you lift and turn in a slow corner, thanks to bad default setups.  You will have to spend some time practicing and tweaking your opponents, your car handling, and your realism settings to find the right spot for you.  If you are willing to do all of this, then this is a fine F1 simulation that will ultimately reward you.  If not, you should pass on this one.  It is definitely geared more towards the hardcore, and EA didn't go far enough in getting people into it quickly.
