Sega isn't new to the realm of the retrogame compilation, but Sega Classics Collection is the first one the company's produced for the PlayStation 2 system. But instead of bringing back a set of original games, Sega has instead revived its properties in completely remade and revamped versions of the game designs.  Sega Classics Collection is a compilation pack that certainly offers a lot for very little, but when that offered batch is nothing more than bland and flawed representations of the actual classics, it's almost a videogame rendition of a bait and switch. Most of these ~remastered~ versions are awful, buggy 3D recreations couldn't stand on their own by themselves, and Sega would have been better off simply throwing the actual originals on a disc instead and calling it a day.   Each one of the ten games put on the Sega Classics Collection disc began its life several years ago as one-off budget games produced and published by an off-shoot company of Sega's: 3D Ages. The idea of the 3D Ages project was to delve into Sega's backlog of classic games and revive them in more contemporary 3D engines and designs at a budget price. Games like After Burner II, Alien Syndrome, Golden Axe and other Sega brands were given additional life as new developments on the PlayStation 2.   The problem: the games in the Japanese series were clearly budget titles right from the boot up. Game engines were incredibly sloppy with slow-down and framerate drops, textures were bland and low resolution, character animations were lifeless and amateurish. And what's more, the original feel of the classic games, for the most part, weren't retained in the updated editions,. These classic remakes didn't even offer the original game to appease the people that may have fond memories of when these games were first available in arcades.   Sega Classics Collection bypasses the individual releases of the 3D Ages single disc distribution, and instead takes ten of the Japanese releases and throws them on a single PlayStation 2 DVD with no additional enhancements. The package includes Outrun, Space Harrier, Virtua Racing, Monaco GP, Golden Axe, Columns, Fantasy Zone, Bonanza Bros, Alien Syndrome, and Tant R. All told, the package is quite beefy with a huge assortment of game genres that certainly has something for everyone. It's just a shame that the quality varies from game to game, from ~absolutely terrible~ to ~playable but dated.~   The most disappointing game in the pack is, by far, Golden Axe, a game that would have definitely been the shining star of the collection. Sure, the original game couldn't stand up to today's elaborate presentation, but what Sega did for its remastered mode is an absolutely terrible recreation of one of the company's more remembered classic arcade properties. What was once beautiful 2D sprite and background artwork is now sub-par 3D, with awful character renders and animation fronting a very sloppy gameplay port of the original fantasy hack-and-slash game. Anyone who's spent a single quarter on the arcade version can nitpick a laundry list of issues, problems, and bugs that pop up in the Sega Classics Collection version.   On the other end of the spectrum, Virtua Racer and Alien Syndrome end up the best of the bunch. Virtua Racer was one of the earliest 3D racing games in arcades back more than a decade ago, and on the PlayStation 2 the conversion has come off somewhat better than the original thanks to a smoother framerate. But still, compared to today's offerings, the flat-shaded, low-detail polygonal engine will not impress, but like Hard Drivin' in Midway's Arcade Treasures 2, the old-school look and play of Virtua Racing definitely has a bit of charm in a classic context. Alien Syndrome is a far more realized action game in its updated form, with the Gauntlet-inspired arcade game moving more into Loaded territory with its dual-analog move-and-fire control added to the simple and fun gameplay. In two player mode the action tends to clunk up with slower action and fewer enemies, but in solo play Alien Syndrome is surprisingly satisfying for as long as the action -- or your patience for repetitive action -- lasts.           Everything else in the package fits somewhere in between. 2D games like Columns and Bonanza Bros. have been left alone in the collection, but since the original designs are ~love it or hate it~ affairs it's hard to get excited for their addition. Outrun and Space Harrier are simple 3D replacements of the 2D designs, and when you experience these games in action it's never clear why the development teams bothered to put man-hours into producing them in 3D to begin with; the gameplay is never ~enhanced~ in the move from 2D technology to 3D, and the bland, sophomoric production values simply draw attention to the fact that these simply aren't the real deal.   And you just have to wonder why Sega didn't throw in emulated versions of the games that have been ~remastered~ in the package. Those are the true classics, not these 3D arcade wanna-bes.   Sega Classics Collection is the ~Muzak~ of old-school gaming. Only a couple of these titles are the real deal; the rest really aren't worthy enough to carry the classics' moniker because, for the most part, the teams responsible for the recreations clearly didn't understand what made the original games great to begin with. Some of the updates have their own playable charm, but for the most part the retro ~magic~ has been almost entirely stripped out in the move.", "date": "Mar 23, 2005"}
