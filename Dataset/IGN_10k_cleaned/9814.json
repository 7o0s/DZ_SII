You'd think that after the immense popularity of the original Donkey Kong Country and the high praise awarded its sequel, Diddy's Kong Quest, almost everyone would have naturally wanted to play this game  the third installment in the DKC trilogy. But even if that was the case for most loyal Nintendo players around 11 years ago, this concluding chapter in the SNES series was still missed by many, passed over because of its release date. Donkey Kong Country 3 first hit store shelves in November of 1996, over two months after the hardware debut of the next Nintendo system, the N64. Those most loyal Nintendo players had already migrated, and playing Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 and Wave Race 64 that holiday season meant no time to go back and revisit the Kongs' Country.   If that was you, then here's your second chance. DKC3 arrived in the Wii Shop on Christmas Eve, just in time to be available during the holiday break for anyone who might have passed it by in the same end-of-year stretch back in '96. The game is a great one, too. A direct follow-up to the two pre-rendered platformers that came before it, DKC3 is a hop-and-bop side-scroller that offers up a new playable character in the form of the overgrown gorilla baby Kiddy Kong, while also pushing ponytailed sidekick Dixie into the titular starring role.   Donkey Kong himself is once again absent, and this time Diddy's also nowhere to be found  the quest for Dixie and Kiddy is to track down the wayward apes and bring them home, all the while continuing the battle against King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The setting takes a shift northward, away from the jungle and pirate ship environments of the first two titles and into the Northern Kremisphere, a region of DK's world that seems a lot like certain regions of Canada or Alaska. Lots of forests and log cabins, snowy areas, caves and run-down old lumber mills. It's a fine new scene.   Pawning your babysitting off on me? Yeah, thanks a lot, Funky.  It's still disappointing, though, that Donkey Kong isn't playable here. It never made sense why he was removed  DKC2's plotline held that he was captured and needed to be rescued, so that's forgivable. But this time around it's not even justified. Donkey and Diddy are just absent, off on a fishing trip or somesuch thing.    It seems like the developers at Rareware might have intended for him to return, because Kiddy Kong handles in a very similar way  he's large, a heavyweight, and boasts the same style of forward roll attack that Donkey wielded in the first DKC. So it's possible he was planned to come back, and only later was replaced by the baby gorilla. But, regardless, he isn't here. And it's worth noting because Kiddy isn't as accessible or compelling a character. All of those Nintendo fans who bemoan the Big N's image of being a ~kiddy~ company got pretty much slapped in the face by this pajama-clad, pacifier-sucking little Kong.   Dixie stays true to form, at least, retaining her ability to descend slowly after jumps by spinning her ponytail in circles like a helicopter blade. And it's a necessary technique for finding hidden areas, which is a big focus in DKC3  you could certainly run straight through every level without exploring and looking for the concealed bonus barrels and bananas bunches hidden strategically throughout each stage, but you'd miss a huge portion of the game if you did that. And exploration is emphasized even more in this installment.   Especially in the overworld. DKC parts 1 and 2 held totally straightforward map screens that simply served as a visual intermission between action stages, but DKC3's map is interactive and a part of the adventure. You have to rent boats from Funky Kong to explore lake areas, uncover hidden caves to search for lost Banana Birds, and sometimes scout around just to find the right way to go to get to the next side-scrolling level.    It's a hit or miss feature, depending on your style. If you want non-stop platforming action, then you'll likely be annoyed at having to slowly swim your way around the map on occasion to make forward progress in the game. But if you've got a bit more patience, you'll be able to find secondary characters like the Bear Brothers and mini-games like Swanky Kong's carnival tent, and ultimately discover new places for more platforming like the ~Lost World~ of Krematoa.Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble holds up very well as a great SNES side-scrolling platformer adventure, even 11 years after its original release. And while its predecessor, Diddy's Kong Quest, is likely a better game overall, DKC3 probably holds more value as a Virtual Console download for the large amount of Nintendo fans who early-adopted with the N64 and therefore missed this final installment in the Country trilogy in its first mid-'90s appearance. If you enjoyed the first two Donkey Kong Country games and never got around to this one, confidently put down 800 Wii Points and give it a download. If you're completely new to the DKC series, start with either the original or DKC2 and see what you think there. Then, if you like what you see, come back here and then confidently put down 800 Wii Points to give DKC3 a download. It's a game that deserves to now be noticed, where once it was overlooked.", "date": "Jan 5, 2008"}
