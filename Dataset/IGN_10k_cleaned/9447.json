Apparently, nobody told this to Vivendi Mobile Games, which has commissioned a lush, visually appealing side-scrolling action game starring the purple puffer. The game doesn't exactly break any new ground -- there's still lots of running, jumping, and gem-collecting. It also trots out the trusted (and somewhat hoary) mechanic of using elements in a paper-rock-scissor manner to defeat enemies and open gates. Fire works best on the wooden enemy, you need ice breath to open this door, on so on.   However, even though Spyro's newest game doesn't advance the ball, it's still an enjoyable little romp for fans of both the character and the genre. It starts out with the tale of an Ape King seeking to resurrect the Dark Master from the Temple of Souls. Spyro and his dragonfly friend Sparx are, of course, the only two that can defeat the menace.   From an overworld map screen, Spyro moves through short levels, defeating enemies and seeking out secrets. Each section of the game is typically made up of a run-and-jump stage, a flying sequence, and a boss battle. From time to time, Spyro earns a new breath, such as ice and earth. He must then backtrack across certain levels to use this power to unlock elemental gates that previously remained closed. In order to smash open a gate, Spyro must switch to the breath that matches the color of the gate and use the special powers of an amulet (usually placed near the door) to unleash a special elemental volley.   The flying scenes are brief shots through caverns full of gems, enemies, and the occasional dead-end unless you have the right breath to unlock a gate. Controls in these scenes are a bit touchy, but it rarely took me more than two or three attempts to complete them.   The boss battles are the game's strongest point. These nefarious foes are screen-sized and loaded with great detail. Like any classic 8- or 16-bit adventure, you must watch for patterns and seek out of the boss' weakness.   I played the new Spyro on a RAZR V9 this week and was very pleasantly surprised by the game's absorbing visuals. The sprites are very sharp and the use of color is excellent. There are occasional cutscenes that move the story forward with completely serviceable text. (Mobile games really need to step up the writing.) The game is accompanied by a good score, too.  The Legend of Spyro: Eternal Night is a great-looking mobile game. But unlike Vivendi's previous great-looking mobile side-scroller, Crash of the Titans, Spyro is a good play. The mechanics may feel a bit common to platforming fans, but the entire package is crafted well enough that Spyro fans will get an hour or so of enjoyment out of this download.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
