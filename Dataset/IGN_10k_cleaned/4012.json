It leads to hyper activity, tooth decay, fat cells, and being stuffed into ovens by evil witches. Much like the old fairytale of Hansel and Gretel, the two kids that found a house made out of sweets in the middle of the woods, couldn't resist gorging themselves on sugary treats, and were almost cooked as a witch's snack, Dreamcatcher's and Wanadoo's Spirits & Spells takes two kids on an unpleasant, candy seeking adventure.   What group of average kids wouldn't think it's a good idea to search dark and spooky woods for a mysterious house that could score them lots of treats? The kids of Spirits & Spells certainly think it's a good idea. Unfortunately for these sugar hungry tikes, as soon as they gaze upon their discovery, they're turned to stone by the Bogeyman. This evildoer whisks away to a mad scientist's lair with the kids' souls -- and it's up to two non-stone, soul intact kids to save their friends.  (No, it doesn't make much sense.)   Features  Play through a spooky adventure to rescue your friends with two characters, Alicia and Greg.  Utilize their special powers like Alicia's ability to control ice and Greg's mastery of fire to make your way through the land of the dead.  Battle skeletons, ghosts, imps, spiders, and other enemies throughout your journey  Gameplay  These two pre-pubescent kids follow the Bogeyman into the Land of the Dead (which conveniently allows one mortal to pass through the gates on Halloween.) This mechanism explains why you'll be able to warp (via magical stones) Alicia, who's decked out in witch's garb, out of Dead Land and replace her with Greg, a boy dressed as a devil. Why would you want to swap between these characters? Because you have to.   Alicia better be careful -- lava is no place for an ice witch. Sprits & Spells is a platformer that relies on the unique features of these two characters to solve puzzles. While both characters can jump and perform simple attacks (Alicia throws her hat like a boomerang and Greg can stab ghouls with his pitchfork), their paths soon deviate. Alicia, since she's disguised as a witch, will be able to pass by real witches for a few seconds without any notice (whereas Greg would be pelted with energy blasts). She has basic control over ice -- so she can tolerate ice where Greg will freeze -- and using magic pumpkin switches she'll be able to turn segments of water into ice. Later on in the game she learns how to shrink herself to pass through small spaces and a powerful hat attack that will damage all enemies in close proximity.   Her opposite is found in Greg, who has mastery over fire. He's able to withstand the hot places that would harm the ice witch and pass by imps undetected. His magical power is a super jump that allows him to clear high obstacles or large gaps. This is later modified into an earth shattering rocket slam.   With these abilities in mind, you'll traverse through a cemetery, haunted mansion, and a mad scientist's laboratory in the Land of the Dead. While you'd hope that you'd encounter all sorts of creative puzzles that require you to utilize these skills in challenging ways, most puzzles are as simple as hitting a pumpkin trigger switch with the correct character or knowing to avoid ice with Greg and fire with Alicia. These puzzles are easy, and so are the other challenges you'll encounter in the game. Get past open coffins by shooting the occupants, which forces them to drop the lid. Avoid stepping in the shadow of a falling rock. Escape nasty falls by walking only on stone instead of rotting wood.   Considering that this is a kid friendly title, it isn't surprising that most gamers would find Spirits & Spells gameplay simple platform fare. The ideas are easy and accessible to kids, but what doesn't make sense is that it's not an easy game -- instead it's frustrating.  What seems like gameplay common sense is tossed out the window making Spirits & Spells a challenge of patience rather than skill.   The first thing you'll notice is that neither of the kids has a health meter. If something so much as touches you, you're dead. While you can hop on enemies or kill them with one of your attacks, they usually don't die. Something is off with the collision detection or depth perception because you'll hit or hop on someone -- without actually hitting or hopping on them. The same goes for several of the platforming puzzles.     You'll jump across a chasm, but unless your timing is perfect and you've mashed as hard as you can on the jump button, your character will plunge into darkness. Occasionally the camera locks at a 2D side scrolling angle for ~complex~ jumping puzzles. However, the side view jumping is complicated by the fact that the platforms are 3D -- you somehow have to line your character up on the edge of a platform so that he jumps onto a narrow opening on an adjacent ledge without being able to judge the depth of the platforms. Because the camera is fixed, you'll usually be jumping onto platforms or into environmental hazards you can't see. My personal favorite is running straight into an enemy because they're lurking just off screen (you don't see them until you've died).   A lot of time is spent rejuvenating at one of the checkpoints scattered throughout the level for reasons that are beyond your control. If you haven't seen enough of an area from constantly dying, you'll familiarize yourself by constant backtracking. Spirits & Spells' reliance on the pumpkin triggers means you need to use magical stones, which you usually don't have enough of if you encounter a few pumpkins in succession.    The concept is cute, but the concepts in Spirits & Spells are painfully simple and equally as frustrating. The storyline and production is aimed at a younger audience, yet the gameplay flaws make this title almost unplayable.   Graphics  The art style could fit perfectly in fairytale illustrations. While the enemies become repetitive, they hold a certain amount of charm in their design. Small touches, like Alicia holding onto her hat to keep it from blowing off her head while she runs illustrates that Wanadoo put a lot of time into creating the characters. However, the textures are fairly bland and overall the title looks more at home on the Nintendo 64 than the GameCube.   Greg unleashes on a skeleton. Also not much care was put into the camera. Perhaps Dreamcatcher thought that a kid's title would benefit from a static camera, but the camera angles make platforming impossible. The added complexity of controlling a camera would more than outweigh the frustrations of dying because you can't see platforms or enemies lurking off screen.   Sound  The music in Spirits & Spells is excellent, it seems perfectly matched to the title -- unfortunately you'll soon grow sick of it because there are only two or three variations continuously looped. But, what there is is a mixture of eerie and light hearted tunes that's pleasant to listen to and completely drowns out most sound effects -- which is welcomed since the effects are kept at a minimal. The most noticeable is the high pitched cackle of witches or the flapping of imp wings. If you listen for it, you can hear exclamations when the characters attack or scuttling of creatures. Cutscenes are accented by the animal sounds made famous by Nintendo instead of actually hiring voice actors. Sound's not horrible, but there just isn't a lot of variation.  Spirits & Spells could have been an entertaining platformer, especially for younger gamers. A lot of care went into crafting the tale and making loveable characters. It's cute -- but that's where the fun stops. The puzzles are unimaginative and simple, yet they're complicated by bad camera and collision detection. The even have a slightly cool play mechanic with the swappable characters, but the potential is never exploited beyond basic color matching puzzles.Even if you're able to enjoy the simplicity of the title and dig the storyline, you'll be frustrated by constant dying due to artificially inflated difficulty. There's little reason to pick up this title unless you're looking for a Halloween oriented game that teaches kids it's not wise to go seeking candy in the woods.", "date": "Oct 14, 2003"}
