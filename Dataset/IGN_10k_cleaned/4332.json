I'd love to be more politic here, but Monolith's new overhead shooter Get Medieval is so incredibly derivative that there's really no other way to get my point across clearly. But if making a direct clone of another title was something that really bothered people we would never have seen Command & Conquer, Unreal or any adventure game at all released after King's Quest. The fact is, the entire industry is based on ripping other people's ideas off. Let's move on.  Even if you plan to treat Get Medieval as a title separate and distinct from the Gauntlet series, it's impossible to avoid looking at the similarities between the two titles. As stated earlier, Get Medieval is an overhead shooter that gives you control of one of four different characters as they roam through a dungeon slaying monsters, grabbing treasure, and looking for power-ups. The characters, a warrior, a sorceress (read: wizard), a thief (read: Elf) and an amazon (read: Valkyrie) all have different skills that set them apart from the others. Play consists of running around killing the different monsters (which range from pesky spiders and bats to fire-lobbing demons and axe-wielding goblins), destroying the generators that spawn them, and picking up different keys to open the various doors of the dungeon. Monsters can be attacked either by running into them face on (which constitutes a hand-to-hand attack) or shooting them from afar with the projectile weapon specific to your character. Unfortunately, as in Gauntlet, power-ups can also be destroyed, promising a bleak future for gung-ho adventurers who lay down a blanket of cover fire every time they walk into a new area. Like I said... pretty damn derivative.  Fortunately the folks at Monolith were clever enough to add a load of new features to the game to give it enough personality to stand on its own. First off, the game looks a hell of a lot better, boasting art and animation that really brings the monsters alive and delivers a better insight into the characters' personalities. And oh boy do they have personalities  each of the different explorers has loads of humorous (well, kinda) messages attached to them that expand on the basic concepts of the character's design. Sadly, these voices are pretty derivative as well, with the warrior cast as a Conan era Schwarzenegger, the sorceress a typical video-game vixen, and the amazon a hard-nosed Xena wannabe. Scattered around the dungeon you might find one of the many power-ups in the game which range from simple potions of health to the more entertaining Mask of Evil (which scares all of the monsters in the level so bad that they run away from you) and Boots of Speed (which allow you to walk around REALLY fast). Finally, one of the most impressive differences from Gauntlet is the addition of level bosses  huge monsters that you must face in a one-on-one fight to the death every so often. This adds a much need break to the basic actions of shoot, kill, grab, walk which can get pretty monotonous after about half-an-hour of play.  In the end, Get Medieval is trying to serve up Gauntlet to an older, more sophisticated set of gamers by adding improved graphics, some bad jokes and a few new play features. Sadly it's not enough. While I had a few nostalgic minutes with this title after loading it up, it wasn't long before I realized that this is a game better left in the annals of yesteryear. Bottom line? If you're an absolute Gauntlet fanatic, you should pick this title up to get another take on your favorite classic. The rest of you will be able to find better gaming elsewhere.  -- Trent C.
