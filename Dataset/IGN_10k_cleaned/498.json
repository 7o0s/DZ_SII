I was looking forward to Unreal Tournament, but only because I thought that it would hold me over until Quake 3's release. Now, after two weeks of almost uninterrupted play (if someone figures out a way to get food delivered directly to their computer, please drop me a line) I think I may have been excited about the wrong game. Unreal Tournament is the closest thing to a flawless game I have ever played. With it's incredible game options, fantastic weapons, and matchless performance, this is the first person shooter for the next few years. I realize that this isn't going to be the most popular stance with those of you out there who are die-hard Quake fans, so let me warn you right off the bat that this is a review of Unreal Tournament, and not a comparison piece. Next week Tal and I will get together and put together a head-to-head comparison of the two games (after his Quake III review has gone up).  Options, Options, Options  What really makes Unreal Tournament stand out is its tremendous number of game options. Where most other first-person shooters release with a handful of standard deathmatch selections and ask players to start whipping out the mods themselves, UT ships with a number of cool play options each more entertaining than the next. The four basic games included are DeathMatch (which also includes Team DeathMatch), Domination, Capture the Flag, and Assault. Let's take a quick look at how each game works and what makes each one so much fun to play...   DeathMatch - Okay, you should really know this one by now. You can either set things up so that it's every man for himself, or you can split the players up into teams and duke things out that way. Since this is such a basic category, this is also an excellent place to chat for a second about all of the cool 'Mutators' that can be turned on for every game. In addition to the six different weapon specific Arena options that can be selected (Chainsaw Melee, Flak Arena, Pulse Arena, Rocket Launcher Arena, Shock Arena and Sniper Arena) in which players are limited to one weapon type, there are also a number of other options including InstaGib (a one-shot, one-kill mode that will make you very nervy), Instant Rockets (which disallows the grouping of rockets (I'll cover this later)), JumpMatch (where every player has GravBoots that never wear off), Low Gravity (kind of like the previous match but you fall slowly as well), No Powerups (no Damage Amplifiers here), No Redeemer ('nuff said), and stealth (all players are invisible - very weird). There's also a final mutator, Fatboy, which is a brilliant option that has become very popular with our crew. In Fatboy, every time a player gets shot he gets a little skinnier. Every time he kills someone else, he gets a little bigger. This means that really bad players get harder and harder to hit while really good players get to be easier and easier targets. Most of these different modifiers are available for every type of gameplay, and when used in conjunction with one another, offer a nearly endless source of gameplay types.  Capture the Flag - Another old standby, Capture the Flag is just like the game you used to play as a kid, only this time everybody's armed to the teeth. You have a base with a flag, so does the enemy. The goal is to steal the enemy's flag and bring it back to your own. If your flag isn't there (it's been stolen by the enemy) then you can't score until one of your team recovers it. Loads of fun.  Domination - I got addicted to this type of game in Tribes, but it works even better here. Basically there are several symbols spread around the level that you must capture and hold. You capture a symbol simply by touching it, and for every second you hold it (keep the enemy from touching it) you get a point. When a predetermined amount of points has been reached the game ends. This is a high stress game where teamwork and knowledge of the map really pays off.  Assault - Our favorite option here at IGNPC were the assault maps. In these mission-like games, one team has to attempt to accomplish a set of goals (take out the gun tower, open the prison door, etc.) while the other team tries to stop them. Once they finish, the sides are reversed and the other team has to try and accomplish the same goals in less time than it took the first team. This is totally addictive, and some of the assault levels (like the Normandy Beach recreation) are among the best I've ever seen in a game.   In addition to what's been mentioned here, there are also other options, like how hard are the bots you're playing against, hardcore mode (game moves faster and weapons do more damage), and turbo mode (game moves a lot faster).  It's The Weapons, Man  The next area in which Unreal Tournament really excels is weapon design. While most of the weapons are the same or have evolved from those found in the original Unreal, they're still a lot cooler than anything else I've seen. Here's a quick and dirty guide to what you can expect to find in the game and why we think it's so damn cool.   Impact Hammer - Okay, every game has to have a hand weapon that doesn't require any ammo, but few games have one that's as badass as the Impact Hammer. This little beauty, like all of the weapons in UT, has two functions. First, is a charge function where the Hammer gains power. When you run into an enemy, the charge instantly goes off and kills whatever was standing in front of you. Yes you have to be close, but it's well worth it. The second more delivers a quick slam (no charged power) that does a fair amount of damage. It can also be used to deflect incoming shots. Cool.  Enforcer - This basic pistol weapon may not seem like much, but I've managed to rack up quite a few kills with it already. In addition to primary fire and secondary fire (just like primary fire but it shoots a little bit quicker and a little less accurately) mode, the Enforcer can actually be picked up twice offering player a John Woo style combat advantage.  Shock Rifle - When used in its primary mode, the Shock Rifle sends a beam of energy that pops distant foes instantaneously. Secondary mode sends out a slower ball of energy that does a buttload of damage to whatever it hits. This is the only weapon in the game to boast a tertiary option as well. If you send out an energy globe and then shoot it with your beam, the globe will explode in a mega-blast that should do in anything in the neighborhood.   Ripper - My absolute favorite weapon in the game, the Ripper is a tool that requires a practiced hand to really master. Basically it fires high speed spinning razor blades that bounce off of any surface that they hit. This allows you to reach enemies around corners or those intent on hiding behind boxes. Sadly, if players are dumb enough to fire it directly at the wall, they'll discover that it is also a very dangerous weapon to the wielder. What really makes the Ripper stand out though is its instant death option - if you hit an enemy (or yourself) in the neck, it will decapitate them, killing them instantly. Once you get good at this, the Ripper can become an incredibly lethal weapon. The secondary mode adds to this lethality by offering special razors that explode on impact doing splash damage.  Rocket Launcher - Tal's favorite gun has a whole host of different fire options. While first-person fans should be very familiar with the explosive power of standard rocket launchers, the launcher in UT offers up a new fire mode in which the fire button can be depressed and held to load up additional rockets (up to six). Once the chamber is full, or the player releases the button (whichever comes first), all of the rockets currently loaded go flying at the target. The raw carnage of six rockets flying into a room full of dueling players has to be seen to be believed. The second option on the rocket launcher allows the same loading option, but rather than propelling the explosives at a target, it lobs them out like grenades. An amazingly destructive weapon.  Flak Cannon - Steve's favorite weapon is the intelligent answer to the shotgun. The Flak Cannon fires a whole bunch of hot metal in a spread pattern that will seriously mess up anyone whose anywhere close to the front of your gun. Since the shrapnel pieces bounce a little bit, you don't even have to be all that accurate. The second option lobs a shrapnel grenade at your enemies. Believe me, if they're nearby when it explodes, they'll be respawning soon.  BioRifle -  This is the only really lame weapon in the game, and even it has its uses. This gun fires out a big blob of toxic sludge that sticks to whatever it hits. Since it doesn't fire very far, and since it explodes when anyone touches it, I usually ended up hurting myself. According to the manual, the BioRifle can be used to slime tight areas that enemies are running through, but I haven't mastered it yet. The secondary function of this weapon releases a really big blob of the goo all at once. Big deal.  Sniper Rifle - Vincent's favorite weapon is the Sniper Rifle. Clicking the secondary mouse button and holding it zooms in a scope at whatever you're currently looking at. Clicking the primary button fires the gun. If you hit anyone in the head, they die. Very deadly as long as no one finds you while you're scoped in on something.  Minigun - Every game has to have its plain old gun, and for Unreal Tournament, that's the Minigun. Not much to explain here, it shoots a whole bunch of bullets really fast and hurts whatever they hit really bad. It's secondary mode fires more bullets but fires them less accurately.  Redeemer - The BFG of Unreal Tournament. This fires a small nuke that will kill anyone in the room where it hits. The secondary mode lets you guide the missile yourself. I didn't find this weapon all that often, so my experience with it is limited. When I did find it, I had a bad tendency to kill myself. In the right hands though (read: not mine), this is the most deadly weapon in the game.  Pulse Blaster - This cool little gizmo is a combination of the Plasma Gun and Lightning Gun from Quake. In its primary gun mode, it fires fast energy bolts that tear up an enemy. In the secondary mode, it sends out a continuous beam of energy that will drop a foe in no time flat.  Chainsaw - A nice little hand weapon that you can use to saw up your foes. Primary mode thrusts the weapon, secondary mode swings from side to side. The latter is good for cutting people's heads off.   As Entertaining As They Come  Unreal is extremely smooth, and the graphics, while not quite as crisp texturewise as Quake III's are impressive to say the least. Fortunately, the game's unbelievable level design quality more than makes up for any deficiencies in overall appearance. My favorite levels  all seemed to be designed by Cliff Bleszinski (which comes as no real surprise) but other levels like Fractal Reactor and Koos Galleon are also brilliant and offer a play experience that is fast paced and furious - the single most important part of any action game.  While this may seem a little odd, Unreal's sound is really more effective at delivering a powerful play experience than its graphics are. When certain big moments occur in the game - you get two or more kills in rapid succession, or you get five or more kills without being killed yourself, a Mortal Kombat like voice will announce your accomplishment to you. Two kills quickly will earn you a 'DOUBLE KILL', three gets you 'MULTI KILL', four, 'ULTRA KILL' and five, the elusive, 'MONSTER KILL!' I found this effect to be very addictive indeed...  The Game Works Like It's Supposed To  Unreal is one of the most polished titles I've ever seen from a functionality point of view. While it seems like this would be a given, in today's market of rushed releases, games that work exactly like they're supposed to straight out of the box are getting to be quite an oddity. Unreal Tournament worked perfectly on every single machine we loaded it up on, no matter what type of sound or video card they had. No patches, no downloads, no anything. I hate to get up on a soap-box here, but this is the way games were meant to be - finished products that are just as easy for a complete novice to start playing as they are for computer adepts.  Once you're actually in the game, you notice this same quality workmanship. Unreal Tournament runs extremely smoothly throughout, even when the screen is filled up with loads of people firing rockets at each other. The built in net play options and internet setup screens are easy to understand and to modify, so getting a multiplayer game started against your friends is a complete breeze. Stopping to change the rules is also easy, and never caused any of the lockups or server issues we've seen with other first-person shooters. The bottom line here is that this is a game that is open and available to everyone who has a computer, not just hard-core computer freaks.  Complaining About Perfection  Okay, so I wouldn't be doing my job as a game reviewer if I didn't bitch about a couple of things that bugged me. First off, there's that same slowdown that I see in every single shooter, the first few times I use my mouse wheel to switch weapons. While it's not really all that bad of a problem, I did have a few lag gibs occur when I was trying to grab another gun in the middle of a shoot out. Next, as I stated above, the game didn't boast nearly as many player models and skins straight out of the box as I thought it should have. While the ones presented are nice, they're nothing in comparison to the vast number of really cool player options available in Quake III. Finally, I really wish the game had come with better documentation. While there are read me and help files available on the two disks that come with the title on how to use all of the included tools, it would have been a lot nicer if the company had just included a complete manual. The amazing thing about all of these issues is that they're all just minor problems. Even with my bitch-meter set to high, I just can't seem to find much about this title that I don't like.  Summing it All Up  Unreal Tournament is getting the highest score that IGNPC has ever given a game. Simply put, Epic has earned it by delivering a title that is as close to flawless as I've ever seen, both in its ability to entertain and in its finely honed technology and presentation. While there's no doubt that Quake III is a powerfully addictive game with some advantages over Unreal, I feel like, in the long run, Unreal Tournament will be the better of the two games. Still, Tal is currently working on his Quake III review and you'll have to wait until next week to see our head-to-head comparison of the two games. In the end though, none of this really matters - this is a title that will keep you (and your friends) busy for a very long time to come. Go buy it.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Dec 7, 1999"}
