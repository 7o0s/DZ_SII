{"name": "Amok", "name_review": "Amok Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/11/17/amok", "text": "This game has been through so many incarnations, I suppose it's a feat in itself to be so good after all this time. Originally designed for the ill-fated 32X, Amok has grown gracefully into the extra power embodied by Saturn's hardware, doing things more gracefully and smoothly than thought possible.The graphics and animation are fantastic. Your sub/walker moves with a disturbing lifelike motion, and your enemies, from the sharks to the mushroom saucer, have personality. Most enemies and architecture are gloriously 3D, with no hint of slowdown except when missiles fill the screen.Level design is more than adequate, with logical objectives and borders, such that you never ask ~How come I can't do this?~ The music rocks, with a fine arrangement of techno-gothic music to flesh out Amok's atmosphere. All the elements of a great game, yet it never reaches greatness because of Lemon's tendency to focus on details, and not game as a whole. Amok's appeal starts to deteriorate when you start the game.There are two skill levels - Easy, and Hard. Easy is already no walk in the park, and Hard is difficult to the extreme. There are no continues and players only get one life, which means frustrating starts from the beginning until you obtain a level password. Likewise, the graphics at first will amaze, then slowly frustrate. Lemon trades in detail and speed for depth of view.At first, while in the ocean, you won't notice it, or even for the first few land levels, but eventually, you'll notice that the world around you fades into nothingness a short distance away. Not a fog or anything. Just darkness. Eventually, all missions feel like night missions, and players will spend time looking at the radar than the intricately designed and planned 3D polygons around them.This small circle of light has other, more subtle effects. All too often, the graphics look washed out, more grey than anything else, cancelling the impact of great 3D. Explosions are indifferent, and the architecture palls. The game is still compelling, though. The controls respond well, and learning to maneuver your vehicle is a pleasure. However, with only seven levels and a rather indifferent graphical impact, it isn't a game to be remembered for long.", "date": "Nov 17, 1997"}
