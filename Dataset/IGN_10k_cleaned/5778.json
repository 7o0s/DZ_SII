It's an unfinished, unpolished, and un-fun game that I thankfully never have to play again. My plan now involves placing it in a paper sack, lighting said sack on fire, placing it on old man Jocob's doorstep, ringing the bell, and watch him get the dirty thing all over his shoes when he tries to stamp it out. Finally I'll get some entertainment out of this ill begotten RPG. There are so many problems that it's hard to know where to begin. Should we talk about simple things like collision problems or perhaps the lack of imagination in the art? How about the missing character customization and automap features? Maybe we should instead focus on combat and why it's not fun? The bugs could also present a fun topic. Wherever we start, it's not going to be pretty.   The game is set in a fantasy world of dragons, goblins, elves (half of whom seem to be Asian), and wizards. There's an evil threatening to wrap the land in its oh so gloomy embrace and only one man, woman, and/or monster can stop it. An evil wizard is conspiring with a malevolent entity in order to grow in power, but like most evil wizards, this particular one can't see the $#!*storm brewing on the horizon. The story itself isn't terrible and I've certainly heard worse. But the fact that there are no memorable characters to interact with makes the progression wholly uninspiring. The lack of wit, humor, or real drama in the writing and voice-overs simply helps waning interest levels fall faster than they would have otherwise.   The absence of polish and attention to detail is a big reason for Dungeon Lords' failing. Rooms are filled with next to nothing (actually nothing in the case of inn rooms that don't even have beds for crying out loud) giving the impression that some thief just scurried out with a gigantic bag of goodies without anyone noticing. Huge halls that should be decorated with statues, items, candles, and banners are completely empty of the stuff that makes worlds come alive as are most other inhabited areas. In an herbalist shop, you'd expect a cramped room with stacks of stuff on the shelves, not a giant room with one bare counter and dully textured walls. Perhaps more amazing are the long load times to get into one of these boxy and bare bones interiors.     The outdoor world is a pretty big environment, but when it's filled with nothing of real interest, it's hard to care. Running from place to place (until you can teleport using the abnormally nifty looking Moon Gates) is tedious as can be. There need to be points of interest scattered along the way, close enough to the road to attract some interest. Exploring the environment is as unrewarding as can be, especially considering the lack of an automap (which makes me want to punch things) to help navigate confusing areas. The paper map that ships with the games helps a little, but only so that you can find a boundary and follow it in a direction to the ~road~ or one of the horrifically bad bodies of water to get some real bearing.   Once outside of the decent starting city, the journey immediately turns depressing. The mighty city of the elves is only four or five buildings strong, each of which is a big blocky blight on the landscape, with no pathways or signs leading from place to place and a population of around nine elves. There was just no attention given to designing the world to make it fun, interesting, or real. When you can't make an elven city or dragon roosting ground exciting or recognizable compared to the rest of the world, there's something seriously wrong with the creative process being used.    The absence of art could also stem from the lack of technology to support it. The draw distance is one of the shortest I've seen lately (which can compound the ~get lost in the forest~ routine) and environmental detail isn't the spectacular. All you need to do is look at the water for the heartiest laugh the game wasn't supposed to provide. Water in large bodies like lakes, as a general physical rule, tends to lay flat across a surface aside from waves. But somehow Dungeon Lords has you swimming uphill and downhill in the middle of a lake. It's absolutely bizarre that someone would see this and think it looked good in any way shape or form.     I don't know how big the art team working on the game was, but it clearly wasn't big enough. There wasn't enough time to create content to fill out the world, even with all of the delays. The best looking parts of the game are some of the characters and monsters. My hero dwarf certainly looked decent, at least until he was running around in form fitting plate armor, which simply made him look ridiculous.   While most models look okay, they're animated without any real personality for the type of creature they are. The relative void of imagination in the enemy types could have been saved by fluid and detailed animations, but that's just not the case. Even the main character is sadly underwhelming, especially considering the animations are stock for each of the races available for play (aside from a little tail swinging for those with tails). Zooming the camera out as far as it goes helps a bit in the outdoor areas, which makes me think that maybe Heuristic Park should have considered creating an isometric RPG like Dungeon Siege instead of a third-person action game. Being up close and personal in Dungeon Lords does nothing to help visual impressions.   The lack of lively animations helped contribute to some seriously sad combat. I know these guys may not have the resources as the guys that created Blade of Darkness, God of War, or even Oni, but if you're going to have an action combat game today, there has to be a more visceral appeal to melee combat. You can feel the combat happening in those other games, even if the systems weren't always the best. It never even comes close here.   Melee combinations involve three or four moves strung together in different ways that end up in a twirl and stab motion that made me embarrassed to play the game. The combos are too weak and the impact of hitting someone with a powerful sword stroke just isn't there. Even Fable, which doesn't have the most advanced combo system in the gaming world, feels worlds better than this. You need knock downs, decapitations, stabbings, and the like with combos or some kind of special abilities. Melee combat basically boils down to hitting the button a lot while running in circles and hitting the quick button for healing potions when necessary, especially considering the amount of enemies around you much of the time.     Melee is backed up with both ranged martial skills and magic. Shooting a bow or throwing weapons was even more boring than melee and I quickly abandoned it. I was never able to find a bow to do damage strong enough to make that option worth the price, especially considering that there was no over-the-shoulder manual aim option for targeting heads for quick kills. Magic is broken up into several categories that make combat a little more fun, but doesn't seem balanced particularly well. It was simply easier to hack through people with a sword than summon pathetic creatures as help or throw spells around that ran out of charges too quickly.   What's especially frustrating is that instead of fighting intelligently designed creatures a couple at a time in interesting situations, Dungeon Lords simply randomly spawns most of its creatures in gigantic packs on the fly. Every time that happens, the game chunks visibly and you'll be assaulted. There's barely a hint of real intelligence from enemies making combat an unfortunate exercise of fast clicking without thinking. In comparison, Blade of Darkness (or even Gothic, which has a debatable combat system) presented designed situations where more skill than blind luck and click speed matter and those are both several years old. There's something to be said about having some random encounters, but they're just awful at timed intervals and shouldn't even be an issue in dungeons, which should all be designed down to the details.  The lack of detail and polish simply killed this game. Things like no breath indicator when swimming underwater, bats that fly underwater to attack you while swimming, no simple animations for doors opening from the outside of buildings, easily differentiated environments, a quest log that can't be sorted, options unable to be reached from in game, resolution problems at the menu, and are all just small examples of ways this game failed to live up to today's standards along with everything else listed in the review above.With enough bugs that it would take a while to list them (including some that caused me to have to reload to a save hours before) and missing features that are listed in the manual and game help text, it's impossible for me to recommend this game to anyone but those absolutely dying for something new on the RPG front until they patch the hell out of it. They've done some, but Dungeon Lords needs a serious overhaul before it's worth anywhere near the $40 price tag.", "date": "Jun 1, 2005"}
