Nintendo spawned a spin-off game based on Wario aptly named Wario Land. Wario went up against the corrupt Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island and their leader, Captain Syrup, and stole their treasures and bought himself his own castle. Seeking revenge, special agents snuck into Wario's castle, stole back their treasure, and left the place a mess. That's where you pick it up in this enjoyable and fun platformer that is Wario Land II. Features: 52 Levels Mini-games  Battery back-up For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Wario Land II delivers in so many ways, its hard not to be entertained. Its appeal ranges from the earliest of gamers to the veteran players. It's easy in its design, but does bring up an occasional challenge that'll boggle the mind of anyone of any age but at the same time won't detract from the overall experience. Wario Land II moves at a rapid pace that'll keep you going and yearning for more, adding a certain aspect of excitement as you finish each level.  There are 12 chapters (stages) to explore, each split into five stories (levels), but to beat the game, you only need to get through five chapters. Each story has its own unique theme and end-boss to defeat, displaying a great deal of diversity that is lacking in most of today's releases. In each story, there'll be a number of puzzles you must overcome to move on. The puzzles aren't very difficult and do take a bit of critical thinking but won't have you ripping your hair out. No puzzle will ever stop the momentum of the game and that's what keeps the game interesting throughout: intricate level design and continuous gameplay.  Wario is an easily controllable character. He has the basic jump command, but he can also do a high jump and a step jump (where Wario grabs extra elevation by using his enemies as a springboard). Wario attacks enemies by charging into them with his fists flailing and can stun them by jumping on their heads. While stunned, enemies can be picked up and used as a weapon. Finally, Wario uses a butt-stomp to shake up the earth to either knock out bad guys or reveal secret passages. With the help of his owl friend, he can fly over deadly obstacles and can roll down steep hills to knock down certain walls.  Now here comes the weird part. With all these maneuvers and special attacks, Wario is, and always will be, immortal in the game. There is NO way for Wario to die. Now it sounds like a good idea, but when you finish the game, you kind of have an empty feeling in your stomach that lets you know you didn't really do it by yourself. Nonetheless, once you get into Wario Land II, you'll forget about your infinite lives and still try your best.  Just because you're immortal doesn't mean the game is easy. Many times, if an enemy touches you or if you fall of the edge of a cliff, the game's environment will send you all the way back to the beginning of the story, so you still need to be on your toes to avoid this and conquer those baddies. Also, some bad guys can affect Wario's condition in different ways. If a ghost touches him, he'll turn into a zombie that can only pace left or right. If a bee stings him, his face puffs up and forces him to float upward. There are many other ways Wario can be affected and is something you should watch out for.  Wario Land II is another reason why Nintendo is best at creating entertaining platformers. It has been a while before a game had me craving for more and Wario Land II had me doing just that. It's the perfect game to accompany you on a long road trip because of its lastability and replayability. I can honestly recommend this to anyone and everyone.", "date": "Feb 16, 2000"}
