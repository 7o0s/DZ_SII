Few games (aside from Konami's Gradius) have surpassed it in its time, and not a single game has come close to it in the next-generation era of 3D games.   It's no surprise that after several years of industry hype about the advantages of polygonal graphics over 2D sprites, very little has been done by developers to surpass, or at the very least match the sidescrolling shooters of the past. Gamers have looked to the traditional sidescroller to satisfy their appetite, and the release of R-Type DX couldn't have come at a better time.  With the launch of the Game Boy Color in late 1998, Nintendo was looking for classic titles fill its library.  R-Type was the perfect game for the new color handheld.  Features: Classic R-Type/ R-Type II Color modes for R-Type/ R-Type II Color only R-Type DX   For  Game Boy and Game Boy Color   An evil alien empire is ready to invade the planet Earth. As the only one who can save the world (surprise, surprise) the gamer must fly their fighter to meet the alien hordes and stop them before it is too late. R-Type DX doesn't break any shooter conventions.  It follows the classic shooter formula of ~blow the alien armada to bits first then ask questions later.~  Therefore, gamers can expect to pit their R-Type fighter against hordes of alien ships and boss creatures.  Inherent in the R-Type series is strategy.  Unlike the hordes of R-type rip-offs which have made their way into my gaming library over the years (believe me, I have more shooters than there sands on the beach), R-Type requires dead on precision, a plan as to how to engage the enemy, and last but not least, timing!  A gamer cannot expect to go very far simply by firing randomly into the screen.  The flying patterns of the enemy ships and their projectiles were designed to be hard to defeat in the original arcade incarnation and the same holds true for R-Type DX.   A neat feature in R-Type DX is the options available in the options menu.   Gamers can toggle the difficulty, game music, game sound, firing speed, and starting level (it depends on how far gamers have progressed).  It is worth noting that all these options applied to all five versions of R-Type in the cartridge.  Despite all its positives, R-Type does have its downside as well. Chief among these is hit detection.  There are times when it feels like I'm driving a truck trough space.  The R-Type fighter's vulnerable spots seem to extend beyond what is graphically displayed on screen.   It could get annoying especially when playing in the higher levels where enemy ships fill the screen and every spare pixel counts.   Another problem lies with the nature of the Game Boy Color screen.   The square nature screen doesn't give players enough time to react to incoming enemy ships, and there are occasions when the computer can get a cheap shot in while the gamer frantically move around trying to avoid obstacles.   R-Type DX reminded me of a lot of 16-bit shooters in its color, style and look and shatters the notion that the Game Boy Color is simply a portable Nintendo Entertainment System.  While upon closer inspection, it is clear that the game isn't quite as beautiful as a 16-bit shooter, the handheld's rich color palette of 32,000 colors allowed for color combinations that were simply not possible on the NES.  What Bit Studios has done in the graphics department showcased a considerable amount of Game Boy Color's hidden potential.  Beyond color, the power of the GBC can be seen in the sheer number of on-screen sprites thrown at the gamer, which is a step up from what we've been used to with the NES, and is a lot closer to what gamers have come to expect from a 16-bit Super Nintendo title.   And yes, there's parallax scrolling too.  R-Type DX is one in a handful of Game Boy and Game Boy Color games that have executed parallax scrolling (layered backgrounds moving at different speeds to created illusion of depth) with ease and beauty.  The moving double layer star fields and hi-tech space station walls all move with a level of smoothness unseen on any Game Boy game before.    If you've seen the movie Aliens whose design was headed by H. G. Giger, you'll find R-Type strangely familiar.  The H. R. Giger inspired art designs in the R-Type DX evoked a kind of spooky 'Alien' feeling which goes a long way on setting tone and mood.    Chief among the drawbacks in the graphics department are flicker and slowdown.  They occur mostly when the screen is packed with enemy ships, something that some gamers might find distracting and annoying.    I remember first hearing the music for R-Type in the arcades and feeling really impressed with the composition as well as the quality of the instruments used.  Bits Studios has done a great job of faithfully recreating some of the tunes on R-Type DX.  The music evoked a certain amount of foreboding fear in the game, and at the right moments, while in other moments, it simply helps raise your heartbeat to all time highs.  As for sound effects, Game Boy Color's limits start to show.  While upgrading the handheld's screen and processor, Nintendo apparently opted to keep the audio component of the original intact.  The results are somewhat primitive blip and blop effects that has become familiar to Game Boy gamers.  There are however some exceptions, such as supercharging shots.   R-Type's audio shows an attempt by Bits to create an epic soundtrack and accompanying sound effects for a hardware with obvious limitations in its audio capabilities. R-Type DX is a solid port of a classic shooter.  If you're looking for a gaming experience similar to the ones you've experienced with 8-bit and 16-bit shooters, then look no further.  R-Type DX, with is plethora of modes, and game variations will satisfy even the most discriminating gamers.  Being a shooter maniac since the days of the good old NES, R-Type DX is one of the best Game Boy Color games I've ever played, and it lives up to the shooter tradition.  Your Game Boy collection would not be complete with out it!", "date": "Oct 23, 1999"}
