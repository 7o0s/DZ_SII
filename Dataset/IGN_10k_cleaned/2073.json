{"name": "Star Monkey", "name_review": "Star Monkey", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/21/star-monkey", "text": "Inhumanly greasy and covered in soot, your keyboard, in controlling Star Monkey, becomes an extension of your computer that'll eat down your hard-earned quarters faster than the neighborhood peep show. What I'm getting at is that Star Monkey will transform your crap hole, as your girlfriend so lovingly refers to your computer den, into the arcades of yesteryear; the ones where some loony ten-year-old with a death wish would hover around you, a fly to his proverbial poo, a constant and gloating reminder of your humiliating loss at Dragon's Lair just minutes prior. Star Monkey brings all this back, (well, sans the ten-year-old, and the filthy keyboard part you've already got down cold). It's a trip back in time, something previously only accomplished via Delorians and a whole lot o' liquor. But has the four man team at Small Rockets pieced together enough that's new and innovative to make the trip worthwhile, or is it just traversing the same loser road in a newer car?   A vertical scrolling shooter on a 2D plane featuring 3D graphics, Star Monkey is classic old-school shooter in the truest sense of the words. Top-wise it moves. Top-wise, I say! That means the game's levels scroll downward, that is, your ship is facing the top of the screen and you move upward, shooting stuff. That's pretty much all you need to know about the game, the rest of all these crazy letters between now and the final score comprise what will essentially amount to pillow talk: a bunch of useless crap that's interjected between the main activities for which the bed was intended to be used.   As main draw for the title, Star Monkey's graphics are really rather impressive, a fact that's pretty astonishing considering the title was developed by only four people and features absolutely nothing the way of graphical options.   As far as I can tell, it displays at 640x480 resolution and 16-bit color, figures that, on paper, seem rather low. Thankfully there are literally never instances of jaggies or aliased artifacts normally caused by low-res graphics. There is, however, some degree of noticeable color banding on the bottom most scrolling layer of the game world though.   As mentioned, Star Monkey is a 2D/3D shooter where all objects, enemies, and effects are done in three dimensions. In fact, not only is the bulk of the game constructed of polygons, but it also features polished real-time lighting, which serves to be the single most impressive factor of the game, visually speaking. Every shot from your vessel and explosion of what you're shooting at will vibrantly and brilliantly light the environment. Cast shadows will even move depending on a light source's relative position to the object being lit. Very sweet and colorful stuff.   Unfortunately, all this candy can, at times, cause an upset stomach. For one, the screen, in an intense fight, will become so cluttered with flash and movement that it's almost impossible to tell just what the hell s going on. If you don't want to constantly die in the game, you'll really have to train your brain to process the seizure inducing, epilepsy causing input your eyes are being exposed to; stuff that would make the minds of lesser men implode and liquefy.   Another problem this game has, one that has also plagued the genre since its inception, is that it's often impossible to tell what can and can't be flown over. As a rule, all background objects are passable; however, enemies come in both landlocked and sky bound flavors, something that makes judging what is and what is not passable a real feat. Though, after only a few plays anyone who can remember how to tie their own shoes will easily be able to recall which enemies in a level are down or up, but once the action heats up and instinct takes full control, you're subconscious will revert to staying the hell away from everything, regardless. It's not exactly the best tactic as some of the fights become so hectic and tight that they necessitate the flying over of things, a prospect that has the 50/50 chance of resulting in death, which of course sucks ass extraordinaire when it happens toward the end of level.  In summary, the game, graphically speaking, consists of vibrant and varied visuals that should prove to be impressive enough where even the staunchest of MechWarriors, Quake'ers, and Max Payne fanatics won't find much to complain about. It's got enough little details the likes of puffs of smoke that get caught and pulled along as your ship passes through them, and a scrolling background that exhibits scorch marks and lighting changes in keeping with the action that do well to deliver a well rounded, polished visual treat.  In terms of gameplay, Star Monkey is classic twitch shooter action, involving shooting, dodging, and still more shooting. Though the game is a vertical scroller on a set path it does leave a little lee-way for players at the left and right sides of the screen. The screen is not static, that is, when your ship moves to the far left or right the screen will move some too. There's then always a small chunk of the screen on either side that you won't be able to see until you venture over there. Don't worry though, thankfully for us it seems the problem of enemies shooting at you from beyond the confines of the game world, that has been a thorn in the genre's side for-seemingly-ever has been remedied in Star Monkey. Now, whenever a horde of baddies want to attack you, they have to be in your visual range first, something that's indeed a welcome touchup to the genre. Why, and as I can remember when getting killed from off screen was the sign of the times. It seemed like back in the day every other game that came out featured this. They called it adding to the longevity of the game as it took you twelve or twenty tries to overcome a level. I called it craptastic. Anyway, it ain't in here.   Control over your ship is broken into forward, back, left, and right movement as well as fire and use. Firing, oddly enough, is accomplished by pressing a button on the keyboard/joystick! Can you believe that? What the hell they were smoking I don't know. As far as I'm concerned the only was to shoot in a game is by waving your feet at the monitor. Even this, the simplest of functions has been somewhat tighten up by the four blokes behind Star Monkey. Pressing the button as fast as you can will result in a firing rate corresponding too your blurry finger, though your phalanges are likely to become the consistency of ass warmed Jell-O after only a little amount of time spent on the keyboard (just put your left ring finger on the left control key and hit it as fast as you can). Thankfully, you can just as easily hold down the button to shoot continuously. The kick here though, is that if you choose to hold the key down your firing rate will progressively slow to a crawl. It then becomes necessary to press down the shoot button for a second or two, let it go, and then repeat. A simple endeavor to be sure, but one that surprisingly adds that little extra oomph to the fundamental play mechanics of the game.   Another touch on play is the range of your firepower. See, your vessel is essentially strafing the ground. After a certain distance all of your shots will inevitably hit the ground. It then becomes necessary to engage hostiles at sometimes dangerously close ranges, depending on how you've augmented your vessel via the power-ups (discussed in a second). There is also no separate fire buttons for shooting downward and shooting directly ahead like in some other vertical scrolling shooters. One fire button is all that Star Monkey needs to effectively vanquish foes both beneath and at eye level to you.  Probably the most innovative aspect of the title (though still not entirely original) is how the game manages ship power-ups. Influenced from the classic Nemesis, Star Monkey power-ups are handled by way of accumulating small power orbs that certain enemies will drop (like if you destroy an entire formation of ships than the orb will fall). This has the welcome side effect of necessitating some of the more dangerous assaults where you would normally simply let the enemies pass. These orbs, once gathered by the player, can be spent on immediate upgrades during play.   There is, on the lower right side of the screen, a basic list of the different categories of upgrades your ship can accommodate (four to begin with, eight in total). Upon collection of your first power orb, the first category on the list will become highlighted (which happens to be ~speed~). You can then choose to spend your power orb on this category effectively upgrading that characteristic of your ship, or you can continue to collect more power orbs. Each subsequent power orb accumulated after the first causes the highlight to move up the list. So, collect one and spend it on ~speed,~ or wait, collect two and then upgrade ~extend.~ With each new orb you move one place higher in the list. Upon passing the top of the list, the highlight will cycle back to the first upgradeable component (~speed~).   Upgrades include, but are not limited to:  Rockets: Adds homing rockets to your arsenal. Extra: Adds, and then increases left/right, back, and diagonal mounted weapons. Laser/Shell switch: Switches the type of ammo you fire to either lasers or shells. Extend: Increases the amount of forward mounted weapons. Speed: Increases your speed.  The speed, extra, and extend power-ups are all cumulative. It is possible to upgrade your ship to such a level where it shoots a whole lot of firepower in eight directions simultaneously; however, with each additional upgrade you put on your ship the negative effects are two fold. First of all, the vessel becomes that much bigger. Every time you choose to extend the ship will physically grow larger and larger as additions are snapped on to it to accommodate the extra firepower. The second negative impact is that additions to the ship not only cause it to grow, but also cause it to slow. Obviously, a big, slow ship is not the best thing to have in a game where there are about a thousand ways to die at any given moment. It's then important to balance where you'll want to allocate power orbs to; the heavier you get, the more that are going to have to spent on speed, and so forth. This tightrope act really accentuates the experience and makes Star Monkey's nonstop relentless shooting a passable play.   It should be known that this game is not for the squeamish though. Star Monkey is hard. I mean really *cough* Interject lowbrow profanity *cough* hard. The reasoning behind this? It's a shooter, goober. That's what shooters are all about: longevity through difficulty and score. You need to have hair on your chest (preferably only if you're male) and chew cigars used to get through this one. This is the type of game people should force their children to play if they wish them to become beings filled with rag, possessing superior hand/eye coordination.   Two things serve to ease the frustration inherent with the difficulty level though. First, checkpoints are spread throughout the game's levels. Dying after a passed checkpoint will cause your next life to begin at said checkpoint. I honestly don't like this particular feature though, because once you die you begin again with absolutely nothing. It's then sometimes really bleeding hard to build your ship back up again if you start in the middle of a level. There should have been checkpoint objects in the level so if you hit those checkpoints and then dies you'd start there, but you could just as easily avoid them if you so wished. The other method by which the game alleviates difficulty and difficulty associated stress is by allowing immediate access to any of the levels you've started from the main menu (beat the first level and the second will be accessible from the main menu).  Once you beat the levels and open up the next, there's no real reason to come back though. Sure, you got the whole score thing and global ranking deal, but who really cares? In terms of longevity, all the game has going for it, aside from its ridiculous difficulty, is its story. Oh, that's right. I forgot, there is no story. That's right. None. I ain't picky either, for a game like this I totally would have settled for a, ~Hey, some shiznit is attacking go shoot at it!~ but we don't even get that. You run the game, navigate its simplistic, but well lit interface that features little in the way of options, start the game, and immediately start shooting stuff. The only reason you even know that a level has ended is because a little screen displaying various statistics pops up and the next one loads. In fact, you can play through the entire game and never even know what the hell a Star Monkey is, or even what you're shooting at! The only reason I know is because I looked at the website, which some poor PR person probably had to write the content for due to the development team's utter laziness in this respect. C'mon man. I wrote this 2,500 word review in a few hours; it is not hard to crank out something, anything, for a twitch shooter called Star Monkey.  The sound is all traditional shooter stuff, laser blasts, explosions, weird beeps and noises, whatever. The music is orchestral sci-fi, space theme stuff. Nice, and not really repetitive, both the sound and music serve as a solid enough compliment to the action. Both, while decent and unobtrusive, are also nothing special. You'll notice them, but you won't care. Not a bad thing in my eyes.   The style, gameplay, and little details in terms of graphics, control, playability, and polish (the VCR esque pause screen comes to mind) make Star Monkey enjoyable, but it's sheer lack of substance, longevity, features, options, and a somewhat hampered interface make it a novelty game at best. Cool to ease the shooter twitch that's been digging at so many of our sides for quite a while now, but still nothing more than a way to kill time between assignments at work, Star Monkey is fun, but runs out of that new car smell pretty fast. Considering it's only a 15 dollar, 10MB download (which you can try before you buy), I don't see any glaring reason as to why anyone should not check it out. But, if you play the first level and go, ~Meh,~ then be forewarned that the rest of the game is just more of the same. Not for everyone, but easily appreciable.  -- Ivan Sulic      Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or Want to share your opinions with the world? send some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Aug 21, 2001"}
