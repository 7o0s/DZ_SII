It's the best game in its genre I've seen in a long time, and I've been getting paid to review games for what, close to five years now.  So yeah, Space Empires IV has a lot going for it, not the least of which is its underdog status. The publisher, Shrapnel Games, is a small little outfit that sells quality niche strategy and wargames exclusively online. Even more remarkably, the ~developer~ of this game, Malfador Machinations, is essentially one guy (Aaron Hall), programming the game in his spare time, after his regular job. Flipping through the credits you can see there's a couple others that helped out with some art and programming, and about thirty (!) people credited for playtesting, with nary an executive producer in sight. Certainly makes you think about the way they do some things in this industry, doesn't it?  Of course this bare bones approach does have a down side -- the multimedia glitz here is essentially nil. Most of the graphics are fairly serviceable (the stars, the planets, the nebulas, and many of the starships look good), but some of them, like the splash screens or the alien faces, are a few years behind the curve, to put it kindly. I was equally annoyed by the audio: the .WAV files would sometimes squeal and hiss or simply drop out altogether during the combat phase, and I never did get the CD music to actually play.   If ever there was a game that should have foregone its own music and had a built-in .MP3 player, this is it. How nice it would've been to cue up some Star Control II MIDIs or the Imperial March to set the mood! (Of course it also would've helped if there was event-specific music tied to meeting each race, ala Star Control, but more on that later...) And anyway, I had no trouble getting my own MP3 player to run in the background.  Most strategy gamers could give a toss about sound and graphics, but the bare bones approach does have another, slightly more serious drawback -- skimpy documentation. The paper manual that comes with the full CD is a monument to terseness; the bulk of its entries give a one sentence explanation, and then refer you to the electronic documentation! And the last ten pages or so do nothing but reprint the Q&A text file included with the demo, possibly confusing into thinking you bought a demo instead of the full thing!  The electronic documentation is slightly (and I emphasize slightly) more thorough and better organized, and at least it's in color. It's in HTML format too so it's reasonably easy to navigate and consult, and since Space Empires IV is a Windows 95 native application, you can minimize it to your desktop safely, consult the HTML manual, and then go back into the game without worrying about a crash. Then again, the electronic manual is also a model of brevity and a master of stating the obvious when it comes to explaining every button in the game, but important information like system requirements I had to find in a separate text file. Arrgh!  The Actual Game  What, we're 500 words in and I haven't talked about the actual game yet! Don't worry, that was just a dodge to get rid of all the real-time ~strategy~ gamers, who don't have the attention span for this kind of game anyway.  Kidding!  Anyway, Space Empires IV is a turn-based space strategy game, a genre usually called ~Galactic Conquest~ or 4x (as in Explore, Expand, Experiment, and Exterminate, or something like that, I can never remember). It's like Master of Orion and those kind of games -- you start off on your home planet, you must build ships to explore other solar systems, found colonies on other planets, research advanced technologies, encounter and either trade with or fight other alien species, and make sure you don't fall too far behind everyone else. The challenge is basically doing all these things at the same time, and the turn-by-turn decisions you have to make based on limited information and planning for the future. It's a lot of fun, even if it is basically Civilization in space.  Space Empires IV is a strong entry in this category. Its interface (apart from a few maddening peccadilloes like not putting number of unused facility slots on the main planet screen) is clean and easy to use, once learned; the game rules are very straightforward and logical and without any major imbalances; and it's extremely thorough, by which I mean nearly every 4X trope you can imagine is touched upon in some way, from having special abilities for your different races, intelligence projects, ruins of alien civilizations that give you a tech jump, to random events, a reasonably sophisticated diplomacy model, lots of trading, begging, and tribute-giving, and even super-advanced technologies that let you make and destroy whole planets and even the stars themselves.  Custom is King  But the game's greatest strength, the one that puts it over the top in my mind, is its sheer flexibility through customization. You don't like how one technology impacts a game? You can take it out. Don't like how the AI ~navigates~ around Black Holes? You can alter the start-up file to create maps without them. I'm already debating getting rid of the sun-destroying weapons because they make it too easy to wipe out the AI, and I don't think they're appropriate to the setting, either.  For me to do that will be easy, because the game includes thirty or so different text files governing everything from the cost of components, the capacities of planets to house resources and facilities, to the layout of the cluster maps, fleet formations, and dozens of other diplomatic, economic, and military factors. You can even change what the AI says to you when it declares war on you and so on. It assumes a modicum of computer literacy on your part, but that's about it.  Best of all, adding a new race to the game (there are about twenty unique alien cultures that ship already) is as easy as using a graphics program to make the ship graphics and editing some text files to describe the empire. Want to stick the Klingons against the Rebel Alliance? Bring the Cylons against the Minbari? Very easy, and already a number of fan sites have produced some excellent custom sets (in fact, when you see Star Trek and Star Wars graphics in my screen shots, that's because I'm already using a ton of these mods and I wasn't going to take them out just for this review). So this game is great news for those who wanted more flexibility in Birth of the Federation, and those of you holding your breath waiting for a playable turn-based strategy game set in the Star Wars universe can open your mouth and start breathing again before you fall over and turn blue.  The Artificial Idiot  I would be lying if I pretended there weren't problems with the game, there are. I've already talked about the graphics, the sound, and the manuals. More serious though is the problems with the AI. It really, really struggles along. Now of course this is true of almost every single strategy game out there, some developers just do a better job of hiding it. Virtually all game AI's still mechanically follow pre-programmed rule-sets.  Wish List  Race-specific MIDIs and MP3s and built-in player (or point to an external player).  Optional tech plateaus affecting all races.  Special techs like cloaking tagged to just one race initially -or- perpetually.  Customized naval doctrines: lots of carriers, no fighters, etc.  Affinities: pre-set cooperation/likeability quotients between empires.  The promised Map/Scenario/Race editor.  Accurate astronomy! There ain't that many black holes or habitable planets in one place.    Here though, particularly since there's an option where you can change which empires are controlled by the player and which are controlled by the computer on the fly, in the middle of a game, the poor AI's glaring weaknesses become readily apparent.  Things the AI isn't very good at: moving additional population to a colony to get it growing (and manufacturing) faster; navigating ships around black holes; fighting in tactical combat, particularly when missiles come into play; upgrading its ships to its most recent components; grouping enough ships together to make up a fleet that has a chance of winning; and -- this one baffled me beyond belief when I first started doing it -- refusing the demands of a stronger empire that it turn over its homeworld to me as a ~gift.~  Yet for all that, it can put up an effective fight at times. The first time I blundered into an AI minefield I lost six ships. And more to the point, because of all the rules and text files that you, as a player, have access to, you can with some investment in time and effort, see if you can make some rules for the AI that give it more of a chance, altering settings (like the black holes) that it has trouble with, turning off stuff like intelligence and gifts, and so on. And if you can't be bothered yourself, there are more patches forthcoming as well as custom AI mods that other players have created or are working on.  Final Score  If you love this kind of game and above all love to tinker, customize, modify, and otherwise play with a software toy the way it was meant to be played with the way I do, then by all means, you should get this game, it deserves about a 9.5 as a final score. If you're less into tinkering with rulesets and what not but still enjoy a good space strategy game, and don't mind downloading a bunch of mods and such from other users, then you will still get lots of enjoyment out of it, maybe enough to rate it a 9.0.  And finally, if you're just going to play it right out of the box and refuse to download any patches, then the score is probably closer to 8.5 or so -- it's a very solid game, if a bit dry in parts, with lots of end-game sprawl and some AI problems, but still remarkably thorough and flexible and a whole lot of fun.  As far as multiplayer goes, currently you can only play it (unless I'm mistaken, with up to nineteen other people!) through the cumbersome method of e-mailing turns back and forth. As typical games run for several hundred turns per player, obviously I didn't have time to test that for this review! But the developer is also working on a TCP/IP patch as you read this.  I could easily have gone on for another few thousands words talking in depth about any number of the game's features -- the diplomacy system, the tactical mini-game, the ship customization screens, the research tree, et. al., but by now you're probably chomping at the bit to try it yourself. So what you should do is visit the Shrapnel Games website. Look at the player forums and learning more about the game's various issues or ask any questions you have, download the demo to try it yourself, and then buy it for yourself, right online, if you so decide.  -- Jason Bates      Want to share your opinions with the world?
