THQ Wireless's WWE games have ranged between mediocre and numbingly awful. Hudson's D12 Pro Wrestling, which is closer in spirit to the subject of this review, was decent -- but I can only imagine that time and changing expectations have not been kind. EA Mobile's new wrestler, Def Jam Fight for NY, is better than all of the aforementioned games. But better than mediocre isn't really saying much, now is it?   The Def Jam wrestling series was a solid attempt by EA to muscle in on the lucrative video game category. Starring a line-up of Def Jam rappers, such as Method Man and Redman, instead of big men in tights, the games were over-the-top pleasures. And now EA Mobile has brought the series to mobile, preserving the core aspects of the franchise -- big name rappers, urban settings, and punishing moves -- but it's hobbled by slow pacing and seemingly shallow game play.   I know, I know -- it's mobile. I shouldn't expect a literal port of a PlayStation 2 game. And I don't. But this just isn't a very compelling fighting game. The controls have been streamlined for mobile -- as well they should be -- but the end result is over-simplification that isn't inspiring for fans of the Def Jam series nor exactly exciting for mobile action fans. For example, you have a single punch key and a single kick key. Whether you tap or hold the key determines the severity of the move. The variety comes in which rapper you play as, since each one has a different fighting style.   (For a better example how to take a streamlined move set but make it feel deep, check out Super KO Boxing. You don't really have that many punches, but the rhytm of the game shores things up perfectly. Every opponent has tricks and tics that help you strategize.)   You can grapple with your opponent and drive them to the ground or beat them while holding them in an iron grip. (Grappling is not easy to pull off, though. Not that it's complicated to hit the grapple button, but because your AI opponents are adept and getting loose.) Weapons in the ring, such as bars, can also be picked up and used against opponents to do extra damage. The more blows you land, the faster you fill your Blazing meter. When it's full, you can activate Blazing Mode and unleash supermoves on your opponent. Unfortunately, few of these special moves really wow.   Def Jam has a basic fight mode for quick matches, but challenge mode is the meatier part of the game. You must work your way through a stable of opponents without losing in order to emerge victorious. (However, it's important to note that unless you play challenge mode on normal or hard difficulty, you won't unlock any extras.)   The rappers in Def Jam include Redman, Fat Joe, D-Mob, and Ice-T. Rapper sprites are vaguely reminiscent of their real world counterparts, but not faces are used. You only know it's Fat Joe because, well, he's heavy. For a personality driven series, this is disappointing. Arenas include places like a scrap yard, a temple, and an underground garage. Only a few of each are available when you first download the game. The longer you play, the more rappers and venues you unlock.    The game opens up to Ludacris' ~Get Back~ (the rapper is also in the game) before mellowing out into basic fight sounds. Too bad every blow is accompanied by what sounds like that digitized hand clap noise on those old Casio keyboards.  Def Jam Fight for NY is certainly better than many previous wrestling-esque mobile games, but if you're looking for good fighting action, you should turn your attention to Glu's Super KO Boxing or hold out for EA Mobile's Fight Night Round Three, which is a deeper, more satisfying experience than Def Jam. I honestly just didn't really enjoy this game on a visceral level -- it's passable. Def Jam on mobile gets some of the trimmings right -- the licensed rappers, the music, the big moves -- but the lack of detailed models, deep move sets, and slower pacing dampens the impact.", "date": "Nov 3, 2006"}
