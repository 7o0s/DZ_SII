Then Brain Age 2 came out and all of a sudden we're looking at a torrent of titles that try and fail to capture what makes the original games appealing in the first place. The latest of the bunch is Master Jin Jin's IQ Challenge, an Ask developed mess that finally came to America after trying its luck in two other continents.   Master Jin Jin's IQ Challenge was a game in both Japan and Europe before it came here. The Europeans may know it as MinDStorm. In Japan it was called Akiyama Jin Kyouju Kanshuu: Zennou JinJin, which as far as we can tell with our rudimentary grasp of Japanese means Autumn Mountain for Progress of Custom Teaching: Whole Brained Man of Virtue. This supposed man of virtue, JINJIN, is an elderly Japanese man, and the guide to the game. For the American version, he's been changed into Master Jin Jin, a creepy looking, blonde haired man with a distinct lack of stylish headband. He looks like a high school choir teacher.   IQ Challenge is designed to exercise five aspects of the player's gray matter: Reasoning, Observation, Analysis, Endurance and Intuition. By playing the games the player can level up in each of the categories. The ultimate Brain Level is a sum of the five categories. Each section has two different games pertaining to it. Doing the math in our heads that's... 10 games. This brain game title has a whopping 10 games.   It doesn't take long to play through 10 minigames, especially when most of them are about 30 seconds long.   A new brain game has to include some sort of innovation to get people to want to play, and IQ Challenge includes a couple things that set it apart. Scene mode, a set of consecutive minigames, offers a variety of choices. Players can select their location - at home, on a break, in transit - and the game is supposed to give them a set of minigames appropriate for the location. We say supposed to because the differences in the game choices are so minor it's hardly noticeable. It's a cool idea in theory, especially since so many people play their DS on the go, but it just doesn't work very well. Maybe if there were more than 10 games to choose from we could see a distinct difference.   No Master Jin Jin, we're really not. It also would have helped if any of the minigames were any fun to play. The problem with so many of these brain game Johnny-come-lately titles is that they seem to forget they're making a game. Brain Age and Big Brain Academy manage to be entertaining while making the player feel like they're learning. IQ Challenge has some games that obviously have some sort of cognitive benefit, but it's about as fun as doing busywork homework. The games in the Reasoning category are actually multiple choice and written answer test questions, making the game feel like one of those boring standardized tests schoolchildren have to take.    The rest of the games are equally boring, or just plain stupid. 15 Pzl is just a slide puzzle minigame that only has a few pictures. We got the same picture three times in an hour of play. Other games ruin any chance of fun by having poor recognition. Search requires players to trace shapes in a fractal image. The game is overly anal about how close the line is that it will mark the player wrong most of the time.   Players can't even accurately track their progress because there is no built in calendar or records system. IQ Challenge does show the player's levels in each category, but there's no way to see when the experience was earned or how well the player did in any particular game. The comments provided by the all too lecherous looking Master Jin Jin are contradictory and unhelpful. He told us we're making ~some progress,~ ~great progress,~ and ~not enough progress~ in a single evaluation. Which is it Master? We're trying to make you happy, but nothing seems good enough! Or maybe it is good enough, we don't know! The game does not have that encouraging feel that other brain games do. It's not so much of a, ~You can do it, keep going!~ as it is a, ~Not good enough, try harder!~   When players actually do well the game lets them watch their experience meters rise up. The sound the meters make is somewhere between the television's Emergency Broadcast screech, and a cat dying. The reward for building up levels is to unlock up to 50 ~riddles.~ These are those riddles most kids do in elementary school, and they're not even interactive. Players can read it, then tap a button for the answer. Woo.It's a real shame that no other company has been able to recreate a game that can capture the feeling and benefits of Nintendo's brain games. Cheap knockoffs only serve to hinder the advancement of this new genre. The biggest insult is that these games always cost just as much as the title's they're ripping off. Why should anyone go buy a game that has wonky controls, barely any games and a poorly designed progress system when for the same amount of money they can get one of three games that do all of these things (and more) a lot better.", "date": "Oct 20, 2007"}
