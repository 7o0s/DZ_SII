But Neversoft, the development team responsible for the skateboard-videogame upheaval of the late 1990s, has indeed handed over the controls to the kids. Tony Hawk's Underground (THUG), the fifth title in as many years as its existence, gives players more customization, more control and more to do in this year's model that it's become a tough task to get it all down on paper.   So let's be quick about it. Tony Hawk's Underground is both a departure and a return for the series. New to the fold is the Story mode, a handful of Create-A-You-Name-It modes, and the ability to get off the board. The same rock solid gameplay, replete with superb control and surprisingly deep levels, is back. For PS2 owners, AKA a bunch of lucky bastards, there's a skateshop full of new online games to play, such as the ability to scan your own face, and to bring everything you have created (your deck, skater, tricks, and park) online, and then to play online. That's really just scratching the surface.    There is no doubt about it, though. After four years of making the same game and perhaps yearning to do something genuinely different, Neversoft is stretching its brilliant but aging franchise beyond the boundaries it defined in October 1999. A story mode? Are they nuts? Face scanning? What happened to all the pros? What can they possible do different?     All respectable concerns, and all soundly taken care of. Tony Hawk's Underground is no revolution. It is a logical extension of every possible facet in the game that succeeds in delivering a rich skateboarding experience. The new off-the-board moves are strangely addictive, the story mode is light but earnest and funny. And the Create modes are rich with possibilities. But the game also disappoints. With the exception of the short-lived but inspired Aggressive Inline, there is nothing that compares to the series. And with such high standards -- set out by the very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater -- Neversoft has made its own job harder than you could imagine.   Shining Skating Star  So it's expanded in every way possible, presenting the same recognizable skateboarding experience with a new narrative and by giving players an overabundance of things to tinker with, tweak and modify. PlayStation 2 owners, without a doubt, score the biggest in this year's iteration. Claiming that Microsoft's Xbox Live system prevents the free flow of changing content and by simply ignoring Nintendo's minute online efforts altogether, Activision's PS2 version gets skaters online to play, but also sets out to get them involved in a braoder fashion.    Head-to-Head Comparison! Don't know which version of T.H.U.G. to buy? We tell you in this point-by-point breakdown, which details the differences between GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox with side-by-side screenshots.  Buy or rent smart.  Read This Now   Using its own proprietary scanning technology for the PS2, THUG enables players to flesh out the story mode to its fullest. It's a simple matter of sending in a digital photograph to faces@thugonline.com. Within less than 15 minutes, players have a low-res texture that's downlodable to their memory cards. The oval image is fit onto a character model, after which players can then go to town customizing their new babies.    This gimmicky feature, which has been available on PCs for years, works. Very well. It doesn't work so much because it's that accurate; my face never looked exactly like my own. But it functions well enough because of the customization I did afterward; because there is something magically connective and gratifying about seeing oneself in a game. In conjunction with the Story mode, it all fits together. You work your way up from local punk to a skateboarding pro. You really do feel like a skateboard star.     The Create-A-Skater mode is robust enough on its own, however, to give Xbox and Cube owners a run for their money. The models are scalable in size, and the laundry list of options is immense. There are dozens of skin textures, eyes, faces, hats, hair styles, shirts, pants, pads, shoes, and sheesh, the list goes on and on. It's deeper than that, though, you can tweak the hue, contrast, saturation and other elements to create a skater that is entirely unique. Like tattoos? Pony tails? Green Mohawks? They're all in here. You can be as ugly, messed up and disturbing looking as you want -- or as cool and tattooed as you want.    Create an Everything   Creating your character is really just the beginning. These expanded features are so deep and robust that Neversoft actually flew us down to its offices to spend the day looking at every aspect of the game, so we really saw, felt and played every new facet. After you have created your skater, you can create your own park, deck, trick and, in the Create-a-Park mode, you can create your own goals.    The Park Editor is really an expansion to last year's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 feature. Only this year, it's geographically larger by about 1 1/2 times, and it's filled with new objects and tools. The two best features, however, are that players can set their own goals, be they simple ~Collect-the-letter~ lists (SKATE), or races, timed or not, or off-the board climbing sessions. You can even set the time of day, morning, noon or sunset. The new car races are a nice diversion, but the physics and handling are so terrible, they're not worth pursuing for long.    OK, there is one more excellent tool, the Rail tool. Super easy to use, it connects everything with a realtime pin tool that stretches from tall buildings to telephone poles to well, whatever. It may be the coolest part about Create-A-Park.    Creating a deck is a superficial task, which simply adds to the overall feeling of customization. Creating a Trick is far more interesting, yielding results entirely functional or absolutely outrageous. If you've ever wanted to do a new trick, one that's never been in any of the Tony Hawk games, you can do it here. Want to make a 540 stalefish flip trick? Fine, do it. How about a triple McTwist? Oh yeah! Quadruple spin, triple flip? No prob. The menu works a little like MTV Music Generator in that players select a trick, represented by a horizontal bar, and then extend or retract it, then add new moves, sounds and finally by giving it a name. With an empty memory card, you can save about 20 of these. Along with several new moves, this is an excellent new function that deepens the game for long-time fans.    Multiplayer  Even though the Xbox and GameCube versions lack an online function, there's an abundance of two-player games, including some old favorites. The list includes Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Slap!, King of the Hill, Graffiti, Firefight, (sorry, Goal Attack and Capture the Flag are online only), Horse, and Freeskate.    The silliest and perhaps most fun new mini-game is Firefight. It's best described as Twisted Metal Hawk, or Tony Hawk Black. You shoot fireballs from in front or behind you. By completing combos, players can shoot two, three or four fireballs simultaneously. It's insane! The only problem with this game is that players immediately try to blast you where you respawn; it's not so much fun getting pummeled right when you return over and over.    Gameplay  Suffice it is to say, the gameplay hasn't drastically changed. There are new tricks, especially in the special category, the new ability to get off the board, and then there is the surfeit of rail, flatland, and vert tricks already introduced in the fatty Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. What THUG does superbly well, however, is to incorporate them into a cohesive, skate-able whole. Neversoft has created moderately big to some bigger-than-THPS4 levels, letting you loose to use every single trick accumulated from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1-4. The designers' influences range from loose, open slates (San Diego) to more tightly designed, packed levels (Hawaii), all of which reach higher into the sky than ever before.    Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, THUG is open in design. Not every goal in a level must be completed, and players are free to find secret tapes, gaps and hidden areas by simply exploring by constant trial and error. There are eight levels in all (ranging from Vancouver, Manhattan, San Diego and Hawaii), plus a bonus ninth.     The Story mode is a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature, and by playing it players are led through a linear, single-ending narrative. The best part is seeing how Neversoft has replicated skaters, from the yo-yo-in-your-face brashness of Chad Muska to the super coolness Tony Hawk to the send up of Stacy Peralta. All of the pros helped craft their scenes, and all performed their own voices. Neversoft's sense of humor is painted thickly over everything, from the bulging, corrupt Tampa police to the bikini girls in Hawaii to the shaky drug dealers in the slums of New Jersey.    Since you play as ~yourself~ or whomever you decide to be, less emphasis has been placed on the pros. No worries, THUG has all the skaters from the fourth game, plus three new skaters. The list includes Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Glifberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reybolds, Paul Rodriguez, Geoff Rowley, Arto Saari, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Mike Vallely, plus several others who appear in Story mode.     Getting off the board is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, getting off means you're free to climb all sorts of areas on foot, many of which are unreachable by skateboard alone. It's tough to get into, because aside from the goals you pick, it's not forced on you. Which is good, to be honest, but it never seems like an absolute necessity. Sure, there are areas such as Hawaii (and later levels) that require it, but it's sort of there if you want it, like an extra. No doubt, late night levels will find you exploring the possibilities the second time through, but the first time around, getting off the board is almost an afterthought.    On a positive note, off-board play makes you think about the game with an entirely new perspective. All of a sudden you're looking around and trying to figure out where you can go, what you can do. The little combo clock adds that tense, time-based factor so players can incorporate their newly found move into a bigger combination. Getting off the board seems a little unnatural at first, but with time, like everything in Tony Hawk, it becomes clear this new ability has potential.    Unfortunately, the sense of control of a character off a skateboard is vastly different than it is on a board. You finish a clean line and feel psyched up, flowing with confidence, and then you get off and feel like you've stepped in concrete. On-foot control, compared to any action, platform or adventure game, is poor. It's awkward and clunky. Jumping is hard to gauge accurately. Just walking around and turning isn't fluid, comfortable or all the much fun. It functions, but it's nowhere near as smooth as it should be.    Because I'm open-minded, I can see why Neversoft added car racing... I think. In the Create-a-Parks, the ability to just goof around is kinda fun. It's light-hearted, and it just gives you a little break from constant line-bending. That's as far as the ~fun~ goes. The car physics and control are otherwise terrible. I won't miss the car races in the next version. They don't work into any kind of rewards -- i.e. better handling, faster cars -- and they don't do anything cool, like skateboard tricks!    Graphics  THUG benefits from its own design team's necessity to stay ahead of, or at least, current with technology. For PS2 owners, the face scanning technology is solid, quick and effective. The result is a low resolution face sample, and it's not always pretty, but it works. The Create-A-Player options and textures are much better. Following that thread of technology, each of the console versions offers progressive scan options, as well as standard, letterbox and widescreen support (16X9).    Both the Xbox and GameCube versions look better than the PS2 version. The textures are smoother in nature, with less sharp, aliased edges, and they boast brighter, more vibrant colors and cleaner textures. In most cases the framerate is the same for them all, but there seems to be more times that the PS2 version's framerate chugs down. Overall, there are big levels, with workmanlike graphics that do the trick.   But to be honest, the graphics in the Tony Hawk series have never been the game's drawing point. In fact, the series has consistently remained in the spotlight because of gameplay and innovation alone, with graphics being more of an afterthought than anything. The face models of the pros look respectable; the addition of the day/night cycle adds a slight variation to the level's vibes, though it's not an active realtime diurnal/nocturnal system.    The addition of new bail animations is always a welcome treat, and this year's effort gives us longer, funnier ones. As flailing players fall to the ground, their boards zip off into the distance; they kick their boards in disgust, or they slowly pick themselves off the ground groaning. Lovely.    Sound  Techno-philes should be pleased. According to Activision, THUG offers PS2 and GameCube owners Dolby Pro Logic II, while Xbox owners get Dolby 5.1. These means the great set of sounds offered up in this game come through cleanly, with no crackling, and straight sharp sound.    I don't know if it's me, but the sound effects are more effective this time. Bones breaking, crunching, snapping and the like, damn, it's like the bailing sounds are so hilariously hurtful this time around. Could be just me. Along with the likeable sound effects, which include ambient sounds, and people saying stuff to you as you pass by, the music list is, as the wannabe kids say, off the hook.    There are literally about 80 songs in this game. The range is the largest in the series' history. I mean, where do I start? There are three frickin' Kiss songs for God's sake! Jane's Addiction has songs, there's a version of Rebel Yell by Assorted Jelly Beans, there's The Clash's White Riot, Social Distortion's Mommy's Little Monster, and well, about 75 more.    While Xbox owners can rip their own soundtracks from outside tracks, there is hardly need for it. The pickiest of listeners can dig into this one and find a handful of songs to like. PS2 and Cube owners can create their own song lists from the provided list.There is a big gap of opinions in the IGN offices concerning Tony Hawk's Underground. On the one hand, there are the fans who love just about everything about the new game. On that same side are the PS2 owners, who feel like they got the best deal, with face scanning technology and an immense palette of online games with which to endlessly celebrate. On the other side are the slightly disgruntled Xbox owners who feel like they should have those damn online capabilities. Xbox live is flourishing, well handled and most good games on the system are online. So why isn't THUG? No reason is good enough.  Then there are the Cube owners who have generally given up on seeing any new online games, and who are happy about the graphics, but seem to, at the very least, admit the game controls better using the PS2 controller.While still catering to the hardcore fans, the game should indeed appeal to the mass public. The Story mode is a light pleasure the first time through. Along with the face scanning technology, it creates a real sense of being in there, however trivial it might seem to an outsider. The Create a-Trick/Park/Skater/Deck additions are robust and long lasting. The trouble comes with the off-the-board moves, which are a mixed blessing. The controls are rough and awkward. They serve the purpose of creating new combos and more of an adventure element, but the mechanics stall the fun. At best, of-the-board moves are an acquired taste, like monkey brains or raw squid. Some people like them...most don't. Overall, however, Tony Hawk's Underground is a solid, if not a perfect, outing. The level design is virtually flawless, with a honed mixture of wide open and tight designs. The gameplay is still as stellar as ever: Neversoft's brilliant collage of on-the-fly experimentation and lighting-fast trick-popping is still as addictive as any drug and as intoxicating as any exotic woman.", "date": "Oct 28, 2003"}
