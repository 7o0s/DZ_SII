It's an assassin simulator. No, it's better than that, it's a ninja simulator. Second, after so many Shinobi titles that we wanted to like more than we did (and sold back for to EB), we can actually feel good about Tenchu. Shinobi was always good, make no mistake, but Tenchu brings the assassin game to a completely new height. Of course, Metal Gear Solid should rock everybody's world, but it's not out just yet.  Tenchu's the kind if game you would only find on a system such as PlayStation -- a brand new kind of adventure game that has never been done before.  You are a ninja and must operate strictly in the ways of a ninja  quietly, in the shadows, unnoticed, with cunning intelligence and speed.   Interestingly enough, most of the levels only give you a guideline of what to do, without really describing exactly what steps to take. This may frustrate some gamers, but it's just like being an assassin, you don't know exactly how to proceed. Instead, and we know it sounds corny, but you need to use your instinct. Tenchu blends adventuring with puzzles, forging an intelligent set of campaigns into a game like none other in the market (save, perhaps, N64's Goldeneye).   You're provided with many tools to carry out your missions. A grappling hook (Another first in videogames. It quickly pulls you straight up on old temples and buildings), Shurikens, smoke bombs, poison rice, grenades, Caltrops, a sword or two, a map, a few wise words from your superior, and a few others little things. Activision has done a fantastic job in carrying over the essence of the game, steeped in Japanese imagery and music, without making it Western -- with the exception of course, of language. If you own the Japanese version and could never read anything, well, now you can read everything. Activision has also left in the Japanese characters at the beginning of each level, another nice touch.  What the company added to the Japanese version are two new levels (totaling 10), each varying in their purpose, better graphics, and smoother animation. The Japanese version in many ways appeared slightly rushed, and the finesse and tuning that was put into this is admirable.Tenchu is the kind of game that'll steal days of your life without you even noticing. It's absorbing, puzzling, and it's absolutely the quintessential PlayStation game. Hard-core, smart, bloody, and fun as hell.Having said this, it's not a game for everyone. It's frustrating as heck, and many people who like arcade style titles won't necessarily dig it. It's hard too, with few explanations or aids.It's all about stealth. Before I became a big PlayStation nutcase, I was a giant Nintendo 64 fan. So, when Goldeneye arrived last year, I simply fainted. And I played it to death, and then played some more. Tenchu takes on Goldeneye, but Eastern style. It's far more Japanese in style, mood, and most importantly, in gameplay. But like Goldeneye, it's all about stealth, being sneaking, sticking to the shadows, killing people before they see you. Again, Metal Gear Solid promises to be the king of these kind of games, but Tenchu is still different enough to make it stand out from MGS. There are no games like this, thus it's unparalleled in almost every aspect. I highly recommend buying Tenchu for a serious challenge.", "date": "Sep 19, 1998"}
