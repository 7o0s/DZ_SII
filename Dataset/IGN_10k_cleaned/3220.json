Developer Rare's GoldenEye came out for Nintendo 64 in 1997 and in the five years since, on more powerful next-generation consoles, competing software houses have still been unable to make a significantly better Bond first-person shooter. Look at publisher Electronic Arts' track record, though, and you'll know that it's not for lack of trying. The company has released several 007 follow-ups, a few of them noteworthy, but none of them good enough to officially dethrone Nintendo's gargantuan success of old.  There's good news though. Eurocom Entertainment, working closely with EA's Need for Speed racing team, has delivered what is easily the best 007 offering in years. James Bond 007: NightFire is spilling with the spy license, from the perfectly realized digital likeness of Pierce Brosnan as Bond to the huge wealth of varied weapons and undeniably secret-agent-worthy locales. It's also got a spot on control, a strong selection of different play styles, from first-person shooter areas to driving levels and more. And yet, it's not perfect, and it's not quite ready to take down GoldenEye. Keep reading to find out why.  Gameplay NightFire, unlike Eurocom's other big project for the year, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is not based on any particular book or movie. Rather, it takes inspiration from several of the best 007 moments across the years. In the completely original storyline, the super-spy finds himself on the trail of a corrupt businessman who's hatched a plan to use a secret weapon to destroy the world. Bond's quest to stop the terrorist before he can do any harm takes him across the world through a variety of first-person shooter and driving levels, deep into the ocean, and soaring into space. You'll recognize elements from past movies, including one or two familiar faces. The truth is that with so many great locales and scenarios to fully explore, we don't care that this game has nothing to die with the latest Bond movie Die Another Day. As in with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Eurocom has done a commendable job of capitalizing on the license. Everything about the game, from the slick opening video to the FMV cut-scenes and selection of gadgets and guns, screams Bond cool, and there's so much to see and choose from that NightFire is easily the best realization of 007's world yet.  Gameplay is split up into two three categories: first-person shooter areas, which make up most of the title, driving levels, and a couple on-rails stages. The shooting stages are significantly better than the racing and on-rails ones, in our experience, but none of them are poor. Eurocom has done a fine job of balancing action with stealth elements in most of these levels. In the second stage, for instance, Bond must infiltrate a castle located deep in the snowy mountains, and it's up to you to figure out a method to do this, of which there are two: you can simply run directly ahead with guns blazing and take your chances or you can go a sneakier route around the castle and slip in unnoticed.  In later levels, you'll have to devise ways to successfully take out a series of rooftop snipers, to unlock several security systems, to make it to the skyscraper without harming a single innocent guard, and more. It's all good fun, particularly the sniping bouts, and it's broken up brilliantly by objectives that have Bond opting for all sorts of handy gadgets, including his laser, grapple, stunner, micro-camera, night-vision and heat-vision glasses, and more. It's easy to see some of the inspirations in the weapon choices, too, which include everything from a briefcase sentry gun to a weapon that enables you to shoot missiles and them guide them with a camera. Very well done.  The driving levels lack the polish of the first-person ones, there's no doubting that, but they're still fun enough too. In these, you'll have to do everything from speeding down snowy roads while ejecting missiles from Bond's V12 Vanquish to taking the car for an underwater romp to the bottom of the ocean and into battle against enemy vehicles and submarines. There are several branching paths in some of these areas, and at times you'll be treated to a satisfying in-game cut-scene as 007's car soars over a chasm and races on. There's a very stylistic 007 appeal to these levels -- they're very much part of the Bond universe, and still we would be glad to sacrifice them for more pure first-person gunplay. There are also stages in which the action unfolds ~on rails,~ or guided by the camera. Here, all you'll have to do is point and shoot. One of the better types of these offerings involves flying around a canyon inside a small plane and blasting at foes. It's mildly entertaining for a bit, but it seems to go on forever and proves to be the least enjoyable of the play types.   NightFire features 12 stages in all, each with sub areas, so the selection is decent, but it's also still one that's likely to be beaten quickly by seasoned FPS players, and that's a consideration. The game can be played on three different difficulties, but there are no new objectives between them, as there are in a game like TimeSplitters 2, or, for that matter, in GoldenEye 007, and that's disappointing, especially since the game falls on the easier side. It probably took us less than 10 hours to whip through the game. To its credit though, we enjoyed it while it lasted.      For the most part the FPS stages are brilliant. They're fast, control is almost TimeSplitters 2-like responsive, there's lots to do and loads to see, the objectives are entertaining and challenging, and the enemy AI is respectable. At points, in fact, foes will take cover behind objects, duck and roll out of harm's way, and strafe around while shooting at Bond. There is even a pesky Ninja character that flips and summersaults all about and then rushes 007 with a sword, which is extremely deadly. It's very impressive. But we do have two major gripes: the first is that occasionally when you shoot an enemy, nothing happens. We've put a bullet dead center into an opponent's chest and he didn't even blink. We're not sure if it's a rare collision detection issue or if these enemies are momentarily immortal, but there's something not right with it. Second is the speed of characters in the multiplayer mode, which we'll detail greater momentarily. For some reason or another, you move more slowly than you do in the single-player game -- to the point, in fact, where we sometimes check to see if our character is crouching. It's never bothersome to the point where it ruins the experience, but it is a complaint all the same.  The multiplayer mode rounds out the experience here and save for the issue mentioned above it's a solid one. Eurocom has included a host of modes including everything from standard Arena deathmatch to Team Arena; Capture the Flag, a last man standing of sorts called Top Agent, a bout in which players must retrieve blueprints before the opponent called Industrial Espionage, and more. There is even a mode called 'GoldenEye Strike.' Several of these additions must be unlocked through the single-player mode, which extends replay value. On top of modes, there are at least eight levels to play in, the ability to add four AI bots (even in multiplayer), the option to customize bots and set their personality types, and more. It's a very complete package in this sense, and while the PS2 version doesn't keep up a perfect framerate in four-player split-screen, it's more than playable enough.  Graphics NightFiredraws a solid environment at a smooth framerate on PS2, with more than enough texture and model details to create a realistic world around its inhabitants.  The Japanese stages have some particularly nice landscaping and architecture, although as a trade-off, those not familiar with Japanese interior design may have a little trouble telling where the doors are.  Those levels also have some of the best lighting, although the game's interiors in general have decent atmospheric lighting when it's warranted, and the opening Paris stage is also an excellent showpiece.  The weather effects, though, are a strangely mixed bag.  NightFire proper opens with Bond infiltrating a snowbound castle.  Here, the weather looks great -- the snow has a great sense of depth to it, which helps fill the expansive spaces around the castle.  Later on, though, there are some rain effects that look terrible, with no depth at all.  It looks as if someone's sprinkling Christmas tinsel in front of the camera, and it unfortunately mars some of the better outdoor environments.  Character animation, on the other hand, is one of the game's strong points.  There's a huge array of different NPC models, and they move very well in and out of the many cinematic sequences.  The bad guys have such fluid animations that I wish they'd use them more, but unfortunately, they prefer to stand toe-to-toe and shoot it out.  Oh, well, they certainly die very nicely (or collapse unconscious, if 007 is kind enough to put them down through nonlethal means), which is sometimes all you can expect of a Bond extra.  Sound NightFire sounds great from beginning to end. The game features a virtual ton of voice dialogue, lots of cut-scenes that explain the story, and huge selection of gadget-specific sound effects. On top of everything else, the music is great. The opening theme song, for instance -- very cool, nails the very essence of the franchise and sounds wonderful doing it. Later, as you pick up the Phoenix laser gun, you'll smile at the crunch and thump the powerful weapon emits as it blasts opponents down with a single shot. From the clank of the grappling hook on metal to the boom of the shotgun and the echo of the sniper rifle, everything sounds exactly as it should and it all runs in surround sound.007: NightFire is a game with a lot to live up to, both past and present.  On the one hand, being a Bond game, it will invariably wind up being compared to GoldenEye.  As a first-person shooter on PS2, it has to go up against contemporary competition as well, games like TimeSplitters 2 and Red Faction 2.  Pretty stiff opposition all round, which makes things a little harder than they ought to be for what is honestly a decent Bond adventure.NightFire, like its predecessor Agent Under Fire, is straightforward and heavily scripted, leading the player carefully through a series of clearly-connected locales and objectives.  It's fun as far as it goes, but the experience can't help but feel a little limited at times -- you go there, you do this, you whack a few bad guys in between, and do it all over again once a new objective arises.  To its credit, though, it makes good use of its wide variety of settings, as well as that certain Bond je ne sais quois, which helps uplift some of the potentially tired mission designs.  And the multiplayer mode comes very close to living up to the legacy, with a huge selection of different modes, areas, and customization options.Call it a successful mission for 007 then, even though there's still some room for improvement.  This isn't quite Goldfinger, but it's a solid Roger Moore effort, and EA's Bond franchise looks like it's on track to achieve greater things in the future.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
