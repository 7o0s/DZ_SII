The hunt-and-seek board game has been played (and duplicated) for decades, and now it's Sony's turn to clone the evergreen strategy game.  Two Cities, sounding a lot like a Frankie Goes to Hollywood song, pits two sides in eternal conflict.  Only through strategic armory placement and clever scouting will you outwit your opponent.  Features: Classic Battleship-esque play Three game modes: Basic, Standard, and Tournament  Two Cities sets the scene on a calvary-era battlefield, replacing destroyers and submarines with stables and light artillery.  Before play begins, you must set up your home base, strategically placing necessarily armaments and supply depots as to confuse and thwart enemy attacks.  Once the pieces are in place, it's time to fire the first shot and hope for the best.  If it's a simple Battleship style game you want, choose Basic mode.  It's a strict copycat of the board game, with piece placement and one-at-a-time lobs between sides.  Thankfully, Sony did more with Two Cities, by including extra modes like Standard and Tournament, or else this would be a short review with a terse closing paragraph.  In Standard mode, you actually use the abilities of your pieces in warfare.  The infirmary can heal units -- unless it's been severely damaged by an enemy barrage.  And the fog of war is lifted by sending horseback scouts to the other side.  Choose your scouting locations correctly, and you'll uncover the placement of your foes artillery batteries or hospital, which will prevent him for using their special techniques against you in later rounds.  Tournament mode opens up the battlefield even further, as multiple cities engage each other in war.  You must choose which neighboring city to attack from a three-by-three map, hoping against hope you'll damage their forces before your city goes up in an inferno.  Should you manage to level an opposing city, it's on to the next, fighting until you have control of the entire board.  Defeating all eight enemy cities is quite the feat, and it will take even the most experienced players some time to divide and conquer.  It is a shame that you cannot play Two Cities with a human opponent over the phone.  Perhaps a later upgrade will include this needed feature, but as a single-player game, it's certainly more than playable.  Two Cities is certainly not pushing the visual limits of your phone, but the quality of sprites and colors is certainly something to be applauded.  Sony could have taken some serious shortcuts and just dropped in placeholder textures or bland hues, but instead, somebody took the time to produce some quality pieces and battlefields.  Kudos, we say.  Too bad the same TLC wasn't applied to the audio, because this is one war that does not inspire aural shock and awe.When I first booted up Two Cities, I was ready to razz Sony for creating a crap clone of an old game.  Then I played Standard mode, where not only do you really see the differences between old and new, but the also understand the challenge offered within.  Use techniques properly and at the right time is a skill to be mastered, especially if you want to make a dent in Tournament mode.  A worthy DL for strategy gamers looking for something more than a quick, five-minute distraction on their handset.", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
