{"name": "BlowOut", "name_review": "BlowOut", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/05/blowout-2", "text": "Ever since Bill finished his last assignment, wiping out hordes of aliens in the Shattered Soldier mission, the two of us (you may remember us as Bill and Lance from the campaign that's codenamed Contra) have turned our combat-hardened brains to a much more meaningful and life-affirming career choice. We've decided to become gaming journalists.   While many of you in the gaming community have appreciated our exploits in the simulated realm of videogames, we have been admiring you, the gaming public-- and especially gaming journalists, for your insightful comments on everything from whimsical plumbers to gun-wielding felons. That's why we attended the excellent Creative Writing workshop at Iowa University... to hone our writing craft as we previously honed our ability to dismantle extraterrestial terrorists. Our first assignment is the very review you're reading now. We hope you'll agree that this review is just as impressive as our triumph over the Red Falcon, or our victory in the Alien Wars.  The game we were chosen to review (hopefully as much for our writing prowess as for our familiarity with the subject matter) is the side-scrolling action game Blowout: Military Fighting Unit, from Majesco. A budget title that debuts at retail for $19.99 on the Xbox and $9.99 on the PS2, this one is hard to pass up at that price point. It may be mind-numbing twitch action, but it's cheap action, and the game is actually pretty fun, even though it lacks variation. Although until you've faced down a bunch of drooly-lipped, pointy-toothed aliens in person, we defy you to say that killing aliens is boring and repetitive.  Gameplay The story goes roughly like this: your name is Cane, a cigar-chomping space badass. You have a bunch of big guns, and an army of aliens stand in your way. You must kill them. Along the way, you will pick up even more guns and even bigger aliens will stand in your way. When it all lies smoking and dead, you will win. Not an original concept, to be sure, but one that's worked in the past.  Blowout is a traditional side-scrolling action shooter, in the vein of the very adventures we made famous--the Contra series. It would have been right at home on a previous generation console, but here it is. Like Shattered Soldier (we had to learn to snowboard for that game!), it features 3D graphics put into a 2D atmosphere. The effect works for gameplay, which is all about running side-to-side while aiming at any angle to drop approaching vermin.     The movement is handled on the left analog, and the aiming is done with the right stick. There is a full range of motion on the right stick, meaning you can aim your weapon at any of the 360 degrees of a circle at any time. If only we'd been able to aim in more than eight directions in our heyday. All of the controls feel slick, from the shooting dynamic to the jetpack, which allows Cane to get to the top of airshafts that jumping just wouldn't reach.   There are also elevators stashed throughout each level. Aside from killing, finding the appropriate elevators and triggering the correct switches to open doors that allow you to move on makes up the majority of gameplay. This can get tedious, but there is a decent map system in place to keep things from getting downright frustrating. There are also destructible walls and floors in some locations, allowing you to get to secret parts of the level that hold the best weapons and power-ups. Healing is handled by regeneration stations scattered throughout the environment. Step on one to regenerate, and use it as many times as you want. Part of the fun and challenge of the game is trying to get back to the healing stations before the aliens catch up to you.  The enemies are pretty relentless, and can be tough to kill. Of course, they range in difficulty and appearance. None of these encounters are all that original, but taking down some of the nastier foes is still rewarding. The boss fights are pretty unimaginative, but the general difficulty level ramps up well. You'll find yourself replaying levels, but it never gets so difficult that you're tempted to abandon the game. Although there isn't a whole lot of variation in levels and design--after all, alien extermination doesn't require a lot of setup and explanation--there is a decent build-up of various weapons. Weapons range from the standard machine gun, to more exotic fare, like the nailgun. Perhaps the most unique weapon in the game, the weapon's discharge sound is fulfilling in a way that we can't fully explain.  All in all, the gameplay is about what you'd expect: carnage and lots of it. Co-op play would have been a really good addition, and could have increased the game's replay value a lot. As it stands, this is a one-and-done sort of game. Not that that's bad. At twenty bucks or cheaper, this is a pretty fulilling play-through.    Graphics The graphics are gritty and dark, as you would expect when scouring abandoned space outputs crawling with vermin. Luckily, there's a built-in brightness control in the options menu, allowing you to shed some light on your adventure. This was a smart inclusion, as the default setting was uber-dark on our TV. Once you do illuminate things a bit you notice the following: the levels are all very similar in look and design. All of them look like decaying dens of extraterrestial garbage. There is little variation to the areas, but luckily there is a well-done map graphic to follow.  The character animation is a bit on the herky-jerky side, and that goes both for Cane and the creatures you encounter. The alien models are nothing to write home about. They are, for the most part, pretty standard insectoid fodder.   One thing that is nice graphically is the lighting. Cane carries a small light around with him and it does wonders for adding to the atmosphere, as it creates little pockets of illimunation in the otherwise dark space stations. It almost looks like the shaky cam lighting that makes movies like Blair Witch Project look creepy.  Sound When a game is loaded with big weapons, as this one is, you expect them to sound decent. Thankfully, they do. The chatter of the machine gun and the pneumatic ~thunk~ of the nailgun are well-done. The other weapon sounds and ambient sound effects are just what you'd expect.  There is very little voice work, and most of it comes from either the gruff main character, or his commanding officer, over the comm. Some of their banter is funny, and thankfully, it doesn't occur too often. Music is atmospheric to a large degree, so it adds to the experience, but isn't all that memorable.   While this game isn't quite as fun as any of ours, itis a worthwhile experience, especially at the budget price point. Ifyou're a fan of this kind of shooter, you owe yourself at least arental. It's lamentable that there's no co-op, as Lance and I had tokeep switching the controller back and forth between levels. And thelevel designer that was rumored to be attached to this game would havebeen a joy to mess around with. As it stands, though, Blowout is betterthan we thought it would be, and definitely worth a once-through.", "date": "Nov 5, 2003"}
