Features  Classic Looney Tunes characters, including Tweety, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn, Rocky, Wile E. Coyote, Little Ghost, Pepe Le Pew, Marc Antony, Yosemite Sam and Tasmanian Devil. Lots of items, such as bombs, cork guns, invincibility, hammers, axes and shields. Four principal worlds divided into 60 levels. Save via passwords. Compatible with both Game Boy Color and Game Boy.   The Game The background story: Witch Hazel has cast a spell on a few Looney Tunes characters to help her stop Bugs Bunny from finding the fabled ~Treasure of the Old Castle.~ Bugs read about the treasure in an ancient book he found in an antique shop, but isn't quite sure where to find it. The book read: ~Somewhere in the Old Castle, there's a treasure that will bring great happiness to its finder.~ The book stirred up Bugs's curiosity so he set off immediately to search for the treasure. Not a very original story to set up the game, but it gives developer/publisher Kemco an easy excuse to use many of the traditional Looney Tunes characters as bad guys Bugs Bunny has to evade. Graphics and sound are adequate and all the characters are recognizable, but the game doesn't break new grounds in either category. As a matter of fact, scrolling is somewhat jerky and the character animation is dated when compared to other Looney Tunes titles.  Players control Bugs via the Control Pad and try to collect eight keys in the game's 60 levels, ranging from a garden stage to an underground treasury. Although he can't jump to avoid enemies, Bugs can use a variety of defensive items to get rid of his attackers.  The defensive items range from bombs, over cork guns, lightning bolts to 100-ton-weights, which can be used to crush opponents.  Sadly, Crazy Castle runs a bit low on strategy elements and originality. Gameplay is mostly just a matter of dodging enemies by pushing weights into them or avoiding opponents by running into doorways. Why Bugs meets his maker when he touches a small yellow bird is beyond us, by the way... Power-ups like hammers to crush ~breakable blocks~, a pickaxe to climb over blocks or speed boots add a bit of variety, but can't cover up the fact that Crazy Castle 3 doesn't really offer anything new over its predecessors. Nevertheless, it's easy to pick up and offers simple fun. Just don't expect anything really new.", "date": "Jul 9, 1999"}
