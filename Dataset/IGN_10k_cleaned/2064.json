There has been a ton of hype for this game which doesn't help VC who has about 10 months to develop a baseball game that would make up for the mistake of WSB2K1. Of course, VC could've been like other video game companies out there; they easily could've used the same engine as WSB2K1 plopped in the new line-up of players for this year, and shipped the game out at the beginning of the baseball season.  But VC, chose the long and tough road - limited to 10 months of development time, they threw out last year's game engine (even though it looks great), designed one from the ground up, concentrated on what makes a baseball game great, improved the visuals as much as they could, and attempted to add online play within their time frame.  So, it's just astounding to me that within this small amount of time, Visual Concepts has delivered a fun baseball game that is definitely better than last year's WSB2K1; while World Series Baseball 2K2 is far from perfect, it's definitely a lot better than many of the baseball video games out there on ~next generation systems~, as well as being a glimpse of what is to come from in the future from Visual Concepts.  Now, let's bear in mind that while I'm totally able to review a Dreamcast video game, I'm not the most apt student went it comes to baseball.  I understand how the game is played and totally respect the historic tradition of baseball, but I'm not the smart baseball student of statistics nor can I recite the entire lineup of the 1989 World Champion Oakland Athletics.  In fact, if it wasn't for one of the greatest baseball games ever made, I probably would give baseball a half-second glance on television... that game being World Series Baseball '98 for the SEGA Saturn.  A good friend of mine, a diehard Giants fan, forced me to play WSB '98 by ~borrowing~ all my good games and threatened never to return them. So, I spent a good weekend with this Saturn baseball game and was amazed at the great batting interface, nice visuals, and overall solid gameplay.  Though we've had to wait a long time for that good old feeling from this great Saturn baseball game, Visual Concepts has stepped up to the plate knowing full well it's the last inning for the Dreamcast.  To lead off (pun intended), WSB2K2 has great overall visuals.  Player models are the some of the best in any baseball game and while the faces aren't modeled exactly, there are some really nice animations as batters blink, pitchers shakes their heads from a pitching call, and many more.  My favorite is when a flustered batter gets a called third strike flips his bat in the air and walks away in annoyance.  Most of the big name players have their well-known stances and animations like Mark McGwire holding the bat low before the pitch and El Duque's high kick when he pitches.  However, batting stances and pitching animations are about where the individual characteristics end - you won't be seeing Sammy Sosa doing his little hop after a homer. But you'll get some pretty cool diving animations as fielders dive for flyballs, outfielders making high leaps to steal homers, and even have base runners ram into catchers hoping to dislodge the ball and score.  Stadiums look really darn nice as everyone of the MLB parks are authentically represented in this game.  The texture of the grass looks very good and there are some weather effects; I haven't had a game rained out yet though.  Of course the crowd hasn't changed too much from the days of the Saturn, but I didn't expect fully polygon crowds either.  To nag, there are a few slowdown issues that are totally apparent when you see a runner get forced out at first base.  Also, there are some limits to the animation of players; there are about only three or four homerun victory animations.  By the way, when you see your outfield jogging back to the dugout after the third out of an inning, it's weird to see them trotting in synchronization.  But overall, the game looks very good, is presented in a clear fashion, and the interface will keep casual and hardcore baseball fans very engrossed.  Let's not forget a fully controllable instant replay that allows you to freely move anywhere on the field!  When it comes to gameplay, WSB2K2 delivers a great hit, but not necessarily a home run.  There are some issues in that make WSB2K2 play too much like a video game rather than a baseball video game.  In the game of baseball, there will always be the human judgment that will lead to errors, badly thrown balls, and pitches that hit the pitcher.  Some of these are intentional and some due to human error.  While you can hit batters with pitches (using the somewhat awkward ~pitch out~ mechanic), WSB2K2 is pretty much error free.  Occasionally, an outfielder will drop a fly ball, or a shortstop will try to field a grounder that hits his toe, but when it actually comes to throwing to bases, I have yet to see an outfielder overthrow to a base.  Additionally, the computer doesn't make too many errors, especially when it comes to baserunning; whether it's tagging up from a pop-fly that's caught or stealing second, the computer makes few baserunning mistakes.  I suppose that's good because the computer is way too easy on Rookie difficulty setting and even on Pro difficulty, it won't be long before you start winning several games in a row.  Also, there's really no disparity between players that play the outfield; I don't know how many times I've made diving catches with Manny Ramirez and he seems to be just as good as a rightfielder as Jermaine Dye of Oakland (yes, I know Manny is the RBI machine).  Baserunning might take some time getting used to, especially if you have more than one man on base.  If you want all baserunners to advance, you simply press the X button, but to get an individual baserunner to run, you use the Analog pad (up, down, left, right being second base, home plate, third base, and first base respectively) and press the X button to get a specific player to run.  So, there are still a few gameplay issues to work out but for me, it doesn't take away from the many great points WSB2K2 smacks home.  Although the pitching/batting mechanic of WSB2K1 wasn't bad, VC has decided to make it a bit easier to handle while making it even more tactical.  When it comes to pitching, each pitcher has an array of different pitches that he can select from by moving the Analog pad to the available pitch in his arsenal and selecting that pitch.  Once down, a baseball cursor will appear inside the strike zone box.  Just like WSB '98 you can move the cursor up until the point where you release the ball.  This enables you to ~disguise~ where your pitch goes as you can select an area of where your pitch will go and keep moving the cursor up until the ball is released from the pitcher; this comes in real handy when playing two player games.  Placement of your pitch is also dependent on what type of pitch you throw and what level difficulty your playing.  Obviously, throwing a fastball will head straight to where the area you selected, but throwing a curve ball will have the ball coming through the strike zone a little bit under the selected position - obviously, it's a good idea to know how your pitcher's curve ball or splitter flies.  When playing Rookie difficulty, almost every pitch is right where it should be and as your progress to higher difficulties, you'll notice the pitches being thrown with a little less accuracy.  This also depends on how tired your pitcher as; under the box showing your pitches, there's a yellow stamina bar that tracks the endurance of your pitcher.  This goes down bit by bit every inning and will go down further if you decide to add a little more ~sauce~ to your pitches.  For example, if you want the Big Unit to throw a little more heat to his fastball, hold down the A button as he pitches and the pitch will gain anywhere from 3-7 mph, but it also decreases your stamina quite a bit.  Also useful is the batter's chart that shows hot and cold zones (very similar to WSB '98).  Every pitch thrown will show up on this chart, red for strikes, green for balls.  The overall speed of the pitches isn't quite as fast as All-Star Baseball but it's hardly slow at all.  What I really like about WSB2K2's pitching mechanic is it seems much more tactical than any other baseball game; I've learned that even though there's something very impressive about throwing a 102 mph fastball, there's nothing quite like making the batter look like a fool by swinging early on the sneaky changeup pitch.  Equally as fun and as cerebral is the batting mechanics.  Like I stated above, each hitter as their cold, neutral, and hot zones divided up nine areas of the strike zone.  Obviously hitting a pitch in their hot zone will really send a ball searing across the field with a greater possibility of a home run, while hitting it in the cold zones will likely have the ball being poped-up in the air for an easy catch.  In homage to WSB '98, batters can concentrate and hit the ball hard by pressing and holding the R Trigger.  While moving the cursor while the R Trigger is being held, if a batter guesses the correct position of a ball's path and highlights it with the cursor, you'll wack the ball even harder.  As for the direction of a hit, it all depends on the placement of your cursor as the ball enters the strike zone.  Placing the cursor right in the ball's path will result in a hard line drive, while positioning the cursor under the ball will launch the ball high in the air.  Yes, you can perform a practice swing up until the pitcher begins his wind-up and you can definitely bunt.  Two small details missing is the ability to switch-hit with different batters and the lack of a distance measurement when you happen to hit a dinger (which will occur too often when playing Rookie difficulty).  While it's too bad these options are missing, considering the depth of batting system, I can easily overlook these small faults.  Of course, one of the biggest faults of WSB2K1 was the lack of fielding, especially since the AI of your fielders was just horrid.  That's changed in WSB2K2 as you can take total control of your fielders or you can allow the computer to auto-field for you (adjustable in options).  Although it's a godsend that you can manually field, there are a few things I don't like.  As aforementioned, every fielder seems to have the same diving and leaping ability.  Sometimes, when a ball is well hit deep in the outfield, I'll a fielder running to grab the ball, but two other fielders are running right behind me instead of trying to be a cutoff man.  Catching errors occasionally happen, but I have yet to overthrow to a base.  Additionally, when a batter hits the ball, sometimes the ball screams so fast out of home plate, it's really hard to make diving stops with the infielders - then again, that should be pretty hard to do anyways.  Finally, there aren't a whole lot of different fielding animations like sliding catches or behind-the-back catches, but that's a bit nitpicking on an overall solid fielding mechanic.  For baseball fans, there are plenty of options in WSB2K2 that will keep all but the most insane baseball fans happy.  Obviously, the online play is one of the biggest features and while lag occurs infrequently, I've only experienced like half-second durations of lag at any given time.  One big change when playing a two-player game online is the pitching/batting interface has one small change.  Unlike a normal two-player game, where a batter can see the pitcher's baseball icon, you won't be able to see it in an online game... that's fine with me, since it's just like playing the computer and it makes the game a bit more realistic.  One of the best things with online play is the new ranking mode that keeps track of your wins, losses, and drops if you decide to disconnect when you're getting beat by my A's 8-2 in the fifth inning.  Unfortunately, if there's some reason the server should disconnect you or if Spot trips over the phone line and disconnects it, that also will track that as a dropped game.  For those not in the online frame of mind, there are plenty of other play modes that will definitely keep you happy.  Season mode allows you to play an entire season with one or several teams and you can adjust it to your playing time and level of immersion - you can choose to play the full 162 game season where you have to play every single game, or you can opt to play a 30 game season and choose exactly what game you want to play.  Furthermore, with a flexible schedule, you can jump ahead to play a specific game series.  You can perform changes to your line-up by moving minor players up.  Franchise mode takes this season mode on to another level allowing you to manage and play as a team for several seasons.  Both franchise and season mode keep track of all the major stats, but be advised that if you use created players and decide to erase a season/franchise, you also erase a created player as well.   There is a trade function available in the game and while there's no financial model tied with the trading in WSB2K2, there are clauses and policies you have to follow.  Still, trading is quite difficult in this game; out of 10 tries, I've only been able to successfully trade four times.  Sometimes I was throwing tons of players to trade just for one player and still got the big ~X~ from a disagreeing computer.  I suppose this keeps it on a realistic level since trades never happen very easily in the real world of baseball.  Still, it would be pretty cool to have Pedro, Randy, Roger, and El Duque all on the same pitching squad.  Lastly, there's the homerun derby that's pretty nifty though I wish there would be a distance meter that would track the flight of the ball, rather than getting the final distance of the homerun.  The likelihood of another WSB2K on the Dreamcast are about the same as seeing Half-Life resurrected for the DC - not going to happen.  WSB2K2 is far from being the ~end all~ of baseball games and that might disappoint the hardcore DC baseball fans that were hoping for a grand slam of a baseball game.  Expectations are quite high for this game, especially since baseball freaks are the most critical when it comes to the smallest details of baseball. World Series Baseball 2K2 doesn't guarantee every minute detail of baseball.  Sure, the create a fielder mode could've had a lot more attributes to edit, and yes, it would've been really nice to see Sosa perform his little hop after a homer.  Of course, it would've been nice to have a fully integrated financial mechanic for the trading system, and perhaps it would've been pretty cool to have batters rush the mound and have each side empty out on the field.  But I think the most important thing, and what many critics tend to forget, is whether World Series Baseball 2K2 is a thoroughly entertaining baseball game.  When you consider the deep pitching and batting mechanics, the improved fielding aspects, the solid control, the awesome visuals, and the online play, WSB2K2 is one of the most solid baseball games on any system and a great sign that the WSB2K series is headed for an almost Yankee-like dominance in the future.  And when the next Visual Concepts baseball game releases, it'll be dj vu all over again.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 17, 2001"}
