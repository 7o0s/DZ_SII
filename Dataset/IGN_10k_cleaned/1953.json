It was definitely a bit strange to hear that they would be bringing a first person shooter to the PC based on the animated film Atlantis due out in a couple of weeks so I was pretty interested in getting a look at it. Now, the catch here is that the game is for Disney. That pretty much means good ol' family values. Which also means an inherent amount of non-violence, which is hard to consider in an FPS. So when I saw their preview game under the title Atlantis: Search for the Journal which was released for free, I got a chance to glimpse what was to come in the retail Atlantis: Trial by Fire. It was as I had expected. A little cheesy with good production values and very little violence. It didn't really bother me. Although it wasn't the prettiest game ever (the look and feel was fairly Disney cartoonish) it looked as though Trial by Fire would definitely have the chance to at least make some kind of mark. Unfortunately I was wrong. It missed close to every mark leaving me with a bored and stale taste in my mouth.  One of the main concerns for Disney when creating this game was the ability to target a really large audience of people and bring those uninitiated in the ways of a first person shooter into the fold.  The problem here is that people are going to get this game, play through it in a matter of a couple of hours (well, maybe a couple more for those unfamiliar with the controls) and wonder what all of the fuss over FPSs has been about. This game is remarkably simple and lacking in almost everything that has been making games in the genre something to like. And my opinion on this has nothing to do with the goofy weapons and way the enemies warp away instead of dying a bloody death. I'm actually glad that someone made the effort to make a game with less violence. But there were plenty of other reasons that this game fell on its face...  Let's start with the visuals since this is based off of an animation. Disney grabbed a license to the Lithtech engine and let Zombie create an environment that looked much like the style of art and animation that was used in the movie. There are some times when it actually does look okay and give that feel, but more often than not, you'll find yourself running through clunky architecture and environments with a ton of harsh angles and ugly enemies. Their need to put this game out to people that might not have the best system in the world has landed them an subpar attempt at graphics that will most definitely alienate any hard core gamer on the market. And the sad part about that is that the specs still aren't that low. Disney had better hope that their marketing campaign with the free discs of Search of the Journal did its job with the casual and non-gamers out there.   Now, looks aside, I was still looking forward to playing this game, thinking that someone might have finally come up with a good FPS that is more suitable to kids and adults with weaker stomachs. But that isn't even the case. At thirty bucks, I would expect a game that would at least take me around twenty hours to finish the single player game with more time devoted to multiplayer. Well, it took me about 2 1/2 hours of basically just running around aimlessly to beat this game. That's just sad and disappointing. I know that there is reason to make it a little simpler at the beginning to appeal to more casual gamers, but I can't imagine this game taking more than 4-5 hours for people that aren't used to playing a game like this.  The levels in the game are incredibly short, small, and fairly uninspired. Let's take the first level as an example. You're in a mad dash to reach a power switch in order to turn the life pods on so that you can get out of the sinking Ulysses sub that has been attacked by a giant creature of some sort. I thought there would be more wandering and challenge, even in the first level, but it literally took me thirty seconds to a minute to finish the level. It was stupidly straight forward and boring as hell. Sure the level tilts like the sub is rocking back and forth and there is some steam poring out of a couple of pipes. But there was really no great sense of fear that you wouldn't get out alive, mostly because it was over so fast that I didn't have time to get nervous. There was no ticking clock with a time limit or anything, just a ~hey, the ships sinking. Better get to a pod.~ Boring.  In the level following that, you get the chance to play around with their vehicles. The control for these was pretty sad in general giving you almost no chance to turn around quickly enough to fend off creatures that you didn't know were there. I died a couple of times not even realizing that I was being attacked. Collision detection was also really terrible in these situations, as there was no real way to tell how close you were to the walls of the caves you're cruising or flying through. Shadows would have helped, but they weren't there. It wouldn't have annoyed me so much if running into a wall didn't hurt so much.  Some of the later levels are a little more creative, but to solve some of them, you don't really need to even look around. You just run up and solve some extremely simple puzzle and continue on your way. There are usually very few enemies to contend with and these enemies have AI just about as dangerous as jello. I think that I got hit once during the entire game. Anyway you look at it, the levels are just slow, way too straight forward, and designed with five year olds in mind.  The story was kind of a no-brainer as it follows the plot of the movie, but in order to really get any sense of being involved in the story, you're going to have to go see the movie to find out whats really going on. There's no cut scenes really so that you get no real sense of interaction between yourself and the other players in the story. You're on one side and then all the sudden, you're fighting on the other side. Sure, it was made to go along with the story, but more effort could have been made other than sticking the same voice acting in the game.  I'd also love to tell you that multiplayer gets better, but it doesn't really. Mostly because the most people I have seen on the servers was two, and one of those two was me. You can't pick a nickname that you want because Disney was afraid of people using cursing in their family game so you get stuck with lame names with weird numbers and letters attached at each end. Part of the appeal of multiplayer games is that you can actually forge a sort of gaming relationship with other players where you see them online and develop into a bit of a team. Not having your own immediately recognizable nickname keeps that level of interaction from taking place. Aside from that, the few maps that I managed to make myself run around in were also fairly dull.   So I can't recommend this game even though I was really hoping that I could. It's just uninteresting, incredibly easy, and not worth the thirty dollars they're trying to rip out of your wallet. Save your money, go by an old Nintendo and play the old Duck Tales games if you need something Disney. Just stay away from this one. It just isn't fun.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Jun 7, 2001"}
