{"name": "Survivor", "name_review": "Survivor: The Australian Outback Interactive Game", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/14/survivor-the-australian-outback-interactive-game", "text": "is a recently released game based upon the reality-based television show from Infogrames.   There have been games released based on television shows that haven't been too bad, like The Weakest Link, but Survivor isn't one of those games.  It is horribly boring and repetitive.  The graphics are weak and even the greatest survivor fan would break the CD in two after playing it for 20 minutes.  There are three modes of play.  Choose from a short season of the final 3 episodes, a half season starting with the merge or a full season of 13 episodes.  Each season can be played with three difficulties, Easy, Medium and Hard.  Difficulty determines the statistics of other Survivors in comparison to the players.  Each episode consists of 2 survival periods, a reward challenge, an immunity challenge and tribal council.  Characters can be selected from any of the Survivors from the first two seasons, Palua Tiga or the Australian Outback, or can be customized and personalized.  There are quite a few models to choose from and players select their own name and occupation.  Also, there are 10 characters skills that can be altered.  Skills range from Assertiveness, which affects how other characters will respond to the demands and desires of the player, to Running, which affects speed and endurance.  After selecting a character to play, a tribe and a season length, the game of Survivor begins.  There are two survival periods in each episode.  The survival periods consist of watching the character complete whatever role the player chooses, like cooking or tending the fire.  The character has physical and mental ratings that are affected by how well the entire tribe carries out their tasks.  Also, during the survival period, players interact with other survivors.  This interaction involves clicking on a dialog choice.  I found dialog to be repetitive, boring and useless.  The conversation is supposed to be a critical part of the game, by attempting to influence other survivors' feelings about the character or other tribe mates.  However, I saw absolutely no evidence that any conversation influenced anything.  Also, after the first few dialogs, it becomes quite boring.  Each episode contains two survival periods, which are 3 minutes long.  When playing a full season of 13 episodes, the survival period becomes torture.  The challenges, which are by far the best part of this game, range from boring to dumb.  After each survival period, there is a challenge, alternating between a reward challenge and the immunity challenge.  The challenges are all familiar from the show, but the way they are implemented in game format is not at all entertaining.  One type of challenge involves using a sling or a bow and arrow to hit static and moving targets.  Another challenge has the player managing the fatigue of a character by increasing and decreasing effort, usually in the form of a footrace or pulling a log.  In playing the game over, the challenges are exactly the same and even in the same order.  As there is not a great variety in the types of challenges, this becomes much too painful much too quickly.   Reward challenges involve food or items that will affect the player or tribes -- depending on the point in the game -- physical and mental ratings.  Immunity challenges give the winner immunity from being voted off during Tribal Council.  During the first half of the season, the tribe that loses the immunity challenge has to vote a member off.  During the second half, when the two remaining tribes are merged, the person who wins immunity cannot be voted off during the tribal council that occurs each episode.  Before each survival period, the player can manipulate how other survivors feel about their character using the Emotional Energy Interface.  The number of points available is affected by the player's physical and mental ratings and the feelings each survivor has toward the player can be raised or lowered.  Alliances can be made with players who have particularly strong feelings towards the player.  The final part of each episode is the Tribal Council.  Tribal Council involves clicking on the picture of the person to vote off and watching as the votes are tallied.  The survivor receiving the most votes then leaves the game.  There is no tension whatsoever.  At least The Weakest Link game attempted some of the humor and tenseness that is found on that show.  Survivorfails to convey even the slightest amount of tension between players during Tribal Council.  Also, who will be voted off in Tribal Council is a complete mystery and appears arbitrary.  There is a multiplayer aspect of the game, which begins after the merge.  Multiplayer is similar to the single player, but instead of a specific challenge in multi-player for immunity, players earn immunity points in the challenges and the person who has earned the most points before each tribal council has immunity.  Good luck trying to find someone to participate in the multi-player with though, as there is no connection interface or centralized location for players to connect with each other.  The graphics are really lacking.  There are cut-scenes from actual moments in the television show.  The rest of the game is computer animated, but it is very poorly done.  The character models are one step ahead of stick figures.  The lack of interesting visuals is a major drawback, but what's one more failure to this game?  The only part of the game that even comes close to being adequate is the sound, with the voice of the host from the television show recognizable.  There are no other real voices in the game and the sound effects only succeed in not being annoying.  Survivor is a very poor translation of a television show to a computer game.  The amazing thing is, according to the manual, there are plans for expansions.  The Survivor: Africa season cast is apparently going to make its way into this Survivor game.  Perhaps while they are at it, they can add an interesting and fun game as well.  -- Staci Krause      Want to share your opinions with the world?
