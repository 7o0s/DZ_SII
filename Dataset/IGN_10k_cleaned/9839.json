It utilized trippy visuals to paint a picture of the inside of a computer and was one of the first full-length motion pictures to use CG visual effects extensively. While it might be known more for its odd presentation values than its enthralling plotline, Tron became a videogame that will forever be remembered in the annals of gaming. It was one of the first movie-to-game tie-ins and one of the only ones in history that actually played fairly well after making the conversion to an arcade cabinet. But how well does it translate to an Xbox 360 controller? That's a slightly different story.    What made Tron such an innovative experience for its time was its four game modes and the rotary dial that coupled with a convention eight-direction joystick to give aiming a slightly different feel than in other games. Sadly none of that comes through in the Xbox 360 rendition. While you do still get the same four game modes  including  Input/Output Tower, MCP Cone, Battle Tanks and Light Cycles  none of them perform as well as you might remember. Because you're confined to the right analog stick swinging your cannon around can be plain old confusing at times as you struggle to orient yourself.    The best mode in the game.  That would be bad enough but occasionally maneuvering your character around the screen can also be a bit of a challenge thanks to some seriously sluggish controls. This shines through even more when playing online with or against someone. Despite the game's lobby system telling me I had a solid connection I still suffered some pretty significant lag in the majority of my matches. Even offline moving around was too slow and methodical. Couple that with the chore of aiming and frustration can quickly set in.   Of the four game modes, and this should be no surprise to Tron veterans, Light Cycles was my favorite. In this mode players must maneuver their vehicle around an environment with a ray of light streaming behind them all the while avoiding an opponent and their own ray of light. Run into the opponent, their stream of light, your stream of light or the surrounding walls and the game is over. It took a few attempts to get the timing of the controls down, but once we found the sweet spot things performed fairly well. That might not be saying much for this iteration of Tron, but at least it was more fun than the other three modes.   Luckily Tron does offer a bit more beyond the standard single- and two-player experiences. Not only can you play in a versus game, but you can play cooperatively where you and a friend can work together for the highest score possible. Then there's a game mode called Pressure Cooker. Essentially it's the same as the versus mode but if you complete stages faster than your opponent then their game speeds up, making it that much more challenging. Not earth shattering but still fun.  This XBLA release makes it clear that Tron is better left in the early 80s where it belongs. The visual style will bring feelings of nostalgia to those who are old enough to remember the original, but like most classic XBLA releases the notion is fleeting. Once it wears off all youre left with is a game that controls poorly and isnt all that much fun to play. There are worse things you could purchase for five bucks, but there are certainly better cheap XBLA offerings out there.", "date": "Jan 10, 2008"}
