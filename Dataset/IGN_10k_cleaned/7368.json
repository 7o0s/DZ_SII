Enter The Getaway and its sequel, Black Monday, Sony's bullet and blood ridden crime dramas through the streets of London.  But while those titles focused much more on character driven tales, the latest racket from the series focuses much more on the seedier underbelly of the town as it makes the leap from the console to the PSP.  Gangs of London focuses on an impending gang war that threatens to tear the grand city apart; however, the game has so many game flaws that this gang war comes across more like a lame skirmish.   Players select one of five gangs to represent in the story mode.  The leaders of each gang has their own particular reason for deciding to wage war on the other crews, ranging from avenging the death of a loved one to the loss of family heirlooms and destruction of personal property.  Over the course of more than 60 missions told in a graphic novel format, you'll wind up squaring off with other rival gangs, exacting your own revenge for various actions taken against your members and taking over the turf of other mobs.  You're never forced into a linear path as you assert your will over London's streets; players are given the ability to pick and choose which missions they want to take on at will, giving you the option to systematically crush one attack multiple gangs at once.  Of course, the only way that you can eliminate the threat of these rivals is to launch a massive attack against the leader of a gang once you've weakened his forces significantly, sparking a massive struggle.    London's caught in a crime war in Gangs of London. Because this is all out gang warfare, you aren't going up against large numbers of criminals by yourself.  You'll have up to three ~associates~ that wear your colors helping out during some of the missions you'll embark on.  Each one of them will have an assortment of weapons, ranging from melee and short range weapons to long ranged automatic rifles and hand grenades.  While you can switch between any one of your gang members at will, you'll immediately be switched between remaining allies if the character you're controlling happens to get killed.  Fortunately, there are a variety of ways that you can potentially avoid losing characters, such as taking cover from incoming fire and blind firing at enemies from safety or taking human shields.  The regenerative health system from the Getaway returns as well, and while you're only given about three recharges to your life meter of varying strengths, you're no longer forced to lean up against a wall to engage the system.  As long as your character is still for a few seconds, you can restore some life to your wounded gangster.  All of this is important because at least one of your gang members needs to survive to successfully complete each mission and get the story to progress, as well as gain experience.   Unfortunately, a large amount of this progress is mired in inconsistent game mechanics and continually repetitious gameplay.  Let's look at the experience system for a second: technically it's designed to improve the skills of the soldiers that you happen to have under your control, but actually noticing an improvement in shooting abilities or resisting damage as you play the game is non-existent across the board.  While there are supposed to be specific strengths and weaknesses of each gang that you should have to take into account, the differences between the five groups are so negligible that it doesn't make any impact on the game itself. The only distinction that you'll actually pick up on is the fact that you don't have access to other kinds of weapons that some gangs tend to favor, but that's about it. However, perhaps one of the largest flaws to the experience system comes in the fact that killed off members in one mission return in the next without any appreciable penalty to their skills or to the player's gameplay experience.  Instead of having to worry about your ~most experienced~ fighter dying and being replaced by an newcomer to the gang, they're miraculously revived for another mission.  This turns every teammate into an expendable shield that has no consequence on the overall game itself.   Unfortunately, there's a ton of gameplay issues that screws up the story mode. While you have the option to give instructions to your teammates as well, the computer will often disregard these choices in favor of what it wants to do (or thinks you want it to do), which will hasten their deaths and potentially endanger the life of your controlled character as well. For example, there are some missions in which one of your allies will have grenades.  While you can tell them to remain in one particular place (especially if they have a great angle to lob grenades at distant attackers), they'll often run directly into the line of fire or hurl grenades at threats closer to your other party members, often damaging both sides.  This is clearly idiotic, and yet you'll find issues like this on almost every single group attack level.  This isn't the only game issue that's flawed; during stealth missions, an enemy can fire a gun in a room next to another one filled with reinforcements and no one will come to investigate.  Other enemies won't attack until the game triggers them to move forward and recognize your character either, and as a result, they'll blatantly shrug off damage that would easily kill them four or five times over.  It's ridiculous to throw four or five grenades into a room or pump one or two clips into a thug only to have him finally start moving and taking damage when you cross his line of sight. And will someone please explain to me how someone blocking a meat cleaver, lead pipe or sledgehammer with their bare hands can shrug of damage from these implements to perform a two or three punch combo consistently?  It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Problems like these and others sucks a lot of fun out of the game.    Mission gameplay issues aside, the overall stories themselves are flawed with constantly repetitive play.  There are essentially three kinds of driving experiences, and you'll inevitably wind up finishing most of them in around five minutes or less, regardless of whether you're trying to lose people following you, destroy a car or deliver someone or thing somewhere.  What's more, the handling of the cars is truly abysmal.  It doesn't matter if you've got a truck or a mid-sized car, because either way you'll have a certain degree of difficulty getting it to accurately turn and maneuver around many of the traffic filled streets. Although Gangs of London constantly touts its 25 square miles of recreated London Streets, you'll rarely experience them thanks to the brevity and linearity of these missions: you don't actually have much of a chance to deviate from a specific path and explore the city or different ways to accomplish your goals.     Ditto to many of the assault or infiltration jobs, which are constantly moving you through similar looking environments with narrow halls and wider rooms.  While I've never been to London, I'm seriously doubt that every building scattered around the various districts of the city have the same kind of layout.  Even worse, you never get a sense that the other crews are actively trying to retaliate against you: while there are defense missions, you never have a sense that you're going to lose ground or see the actual response from other gangs that are resisting your attacks. As a result, once you look past the tenuous plot connections thanks to the graphic novel format, you discover that you're basically playing the same game over and over five separate times with only the accents and weapons to differentiate what you're doing.     At least you can play snooker and drown your sorrows at a virtual pub. When you complete Story mode (or become bored of it entirely), you'll find that Gangs of London tries to add a lot of extra content to keep your interest.  It's more of a toss up whether or not it succeeds though. Just like the console titles, the Free Roam mode lets players actually experience the 25 square miles of London that they won't really get a sense of from the Story mode.  Unlike the console games though, Gangs of London includes a map of the city streets, so you can actually find out what street you're driving or running down. You're also given a variety of things to do within this Free Roam Mode: some of them, such as Speed Trap, Riot Control and 4 Weeks Later (a zombie send up), suffer from the same issues that I mentioned earlier, while other unique ones, such as London Tourist, actually puts the formula on its head by having you travel around the city, taking vacation photos of landmarks.  While the tourist mode is the most interesting one of the Free Roam Modes, it probably won't captivate you for very long. The same can be said about The Pub, which is full of diversionary games, such as Darts, Skittles, US and UK 8-Ball and an arcade machine that's a hyped up version of the old (ever expanding) Snake game. It's nice for a while, but you're not going to spend a large amount of time playing these games on the PSP when you could easily head down to an actual pub, grab a beer and play them in real life.    At least the Gang Battle modes is intriguing.  Gang Battle is a turn based Gangs of London-style game of Risk, with the overall aim of taking over all of London with your various troops.  You can move characters from one territory to another, and purchase cards of three various levels that you can use to augment your strategic takeover of turf.  It's an interesting diversion, and one that you may wind up playing for a while, potentially more than the story mode since there's actually ground won and lost here, even though it's much more of a numbers situation and left up to the luck of the draw at times.I have to admit to being rather disappointed in Gangs of London.  There was a lot of promise with the game, particularly because it touted five perspectives on taking over the city, as well as a game sharing feature that would let friends play a demo that would be unique to their personal PSP.  But after playing the actual title, there's no way that I'd want to subject friends to the bland missions, continually infuriating AI and gameplay issues and repetitive story structure.  While Gang Battle and some of the Pub and Free Roam modes are engaging for a while, they won't make up for the exceedingly sloppy play of the Story Mode.", "date": "Oct 14, 2006"}
