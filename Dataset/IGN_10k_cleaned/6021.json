It can be said, however, that in a genre this cramped, it takes a lot to make one game stand out from the rest. Whether it is through quantity of cars and tracks, technical advances, refined gameplay, or overall design, it's imperative that any current generation racer possess something that its competition doesn't in order to warrant play. Motorhead shows that this is a lesson its UK-based developer, Gremlin Interactive, has clearly failed to learn.  Rather than invest time in any of the above areas, Gremlin instead opted to differentiate its game through visual design alone, which, in this case, sets this game in a sort of quasi-futuristic world with oddly similar concept cars in which to race. While it succeeds in looking different from its competition, its environments are also extremely sterile in comparison.  The game presents players with 10 cars from which to chose (three initially selectable, seven hidden) and eight courses, only two of which can be selected right off the bat. In addition to the standard fare of time trial, single race, and league racing play, the game also offers a ghost mode in which you compete against a replay of your own past runs. There's also a two player split-screen mode.  Offering a 60fps mode (three cars on track) and 30fps mode (five cars on track) it's definitely a fast game, but at what cost? In addition to the sparse environments, it suffers from an inexcusable amount of pop-in close to the screen given the extreme amount of fog that's poorly attempting to hide it.  From a gameplay standpoint, Motorhead comes up equally lacking, proving nothing but average across the board. Rather than aim for realism, Gremlin has instead opted to follow the original Ridge Racer model, which makes for floaty control and an unnatural reliance on power slides.  In a category that has come to necessitate innovation, Motorhead offers little. In the end, it's strictly average, and that's not enough to recommend it in the presence of genre-progressing titles the likes of Gran Turismo. It's not the worst racing game we've ever encountered, but it is quite possibly the most generic.  Randy Nelson", "date": "Dec 3, 1998"}
