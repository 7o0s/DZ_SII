The studio even managed to get the engine a first decent project, the solid GBA port of Wing Commander Prophecy. The second production, however, didn't have the luxury of an existing game design; Ozzy & Drix is the team's first original game release to use the 3D technology. And it's bad. Really, really bad. Ozzy & Drix is a seriously flawed platformer, and even the novelty of 3D on the handheld can't rescue it. Perhaps Midway put the pressure on the team to get the game out before the license went stale. Whatever the reason, this game, like the diseased enemies in the storyline, should be avoided. Or exterminated. Either's fine. Features Two playable characters Two styles of gameplay Password save  Perhaps it's appropriate that Raylight Studios put its 3D technology, dubbed Blue Roses to use in Ozzy & Drix as the game's based upon the cartoon spin-off of the hybrid 2D/3D feature film Osmosis Jones. The team definitely isn't shy showing off what the game can do, since every little nuance -- from the platform and driving sequences to the storyline cutscenes -- features realtime rendered 3D objects. Ozzy & Drix attempts to be what Crystal Dynamics did in one of the first ~official~ 3D platformers, Pandemonium. And like Pandemonium, Ozzy & Drix  fixes the perspective to adjust for the lack of processing power in the GBA. It's a 3D environment, but in reality it's just a 2D platformer with 3D graphic elements. But while the team may know technology, their knowledge in game design, or at least the ability to implement gameplay ideas into their engine, isn't nearly as strong.   As impressive as the game looks, the fixed camera causes adds a ton of problems and frustration to the game design, mainly in the side-scrolling environments. The camera focuses on the player controlled character and never frees its lock on him. As players move through the area, the first problem arises: there are far, far too many blind jumps in Ozzy & Drix. The level designers put a ton of bottom and bottomless pits in the game, and without the ability to force the camera to look down, the only way players are going to know if it's a ~safe~ or ~deadly~ fall is to, well, fall into it. There are also a lot of one-tile platforms to leap across, but since the camera always puts the character in the middle of the screen, players will, many times, have to guess where that platform is, off-screen. Astoundingly annoying.  And then there are the control issues. The designers kept the game design as simple as possible...it is a kid's game, after all. All players need to do is to run and jump from right to left in each of the scrolling environments. Characters even have a double jump to get up higher ledges or leap across extended chasms. But the double jump is incredibly unresponsive that doesn't get triggered nearly half the time. On top of this, the collision detection when blasting enemies is also very sketchy, with bullets that look like they simply pass through their targets. On further inspection, this mostly happens when firing the weapon after turning around...and since the character's a 3D object, the ~turn around~ animation points the gun in the angles either toward or away from the player, which sends the bullet off into a direction that the enemies aren't. This is incredibly bad game design since 99 percent of the gameplay takes place in a left-right fashion, and there's simply no reason to have a bullet zing off into a direction where the platforms (and enemies) don't go. When a game makes you extremely frustrated by the end of the first level, you know something's not-quite-right, but that's exactly what happens after playing Ozzy & Drix for the Game Boy Advance. Midway hasn't been the brightest gem in the pile of GBA game publishers of late, and this game doesn't do anything to buff 'em to a shine. The only real feather in this cap is the Blue Roses engine, which Raylight has already established as a significantly powerful 3D technology for the GBA hardware in Wing Commander Prophecy. It's a sugar coating with no substance: frustrating controls, bad level design, wonky collision detection...technology alone can't save it.", "date": "Jan 15, 2004"}
