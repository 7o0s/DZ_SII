{"name": "Super Runabout", "name_review": "Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/27/super-runabout-san-francisco-edition", "text": "While there are a lot of video gamers who prefer driving games with super-realistic controls, I'm not one of them.  Sure, the super realism of games like Gran Turismo and SEGA GT have a certain ~sim~ appeal about them, but I prefer the arcade-like feel of such driving games like Daytona, Ridge Racer, and, of course, Crazy Taxi.  These arcade-like driving games, while still retaining the basic physics and driving mechanics that make racing enjoyable, aren't worried about the technical details that can hinder the all-important aspect of a video game - fun.  Crazy Taxi, specifically, throws out all the manner of driving civilities, and gets away with it because its addictive, controls solidly, and even though driving underwater may be a bit strange, it never goes way over the top.  Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition takes the same model of Crazy Taxi, where the wild driving gameplay you experience comes with a warning right when you boot the game: WARNING:The car driving experience you will have in this game is possible only in a virtual world and is very dangerous.  Please do not try to duplicate  Funny that this warning is unnecessary; even though Super Runabout: SFE has some of the craziest driving situations and crashes in any racing game, the floaty control, overdone physics, mediocre visuals, and buggy gameplay will make it impossible to duplicate in real life.  If Super Runabout: SFE gets brownie points, it's the good number of options the game has.  Starting a game, you get to select from two types of scenarios.  Scenario A places you in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of ~messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service~ rolled up in one, while Scenario B has you playing the role of some laid-back San Francisco police officers.  The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, collecting bombs for disposal, or delivering condiments to City Hall... yeah, weird.  And the missions get weirder and weirder as you progress through the game.  Also, I can honestly say that Super Runabout: SFE has a strange selection of vehicles for you to crash with.  From mopeds, vans, police cars, and a truck straight out of the TV show ~Sanford and Son~, these are some of the weirdest cars vehicles I've seen in a video game and certainly add a lot of character to the game.  You can also modify parts of each vehicle in your preference of grip, suspension, and brake power.  Not that it really matters, since the game lacks any sense of normal physics.  It's quite evident that Newton's Laws were thrown out of the drawing board when Super Runabout:SFE was being designed.  For a driving game that has collisions as a normal experience, the way cars spin, flip-over, and collide are not only unrealistic, they are beyond reason.  One crash I experienced had my car spinning like a top for at least 2 full minutes.  While at first it's humorous, it happens all the time with every car, van, truck, and motorcycle... and that gets tedious.  And during these times when you're spinning forever, there's no way to stop it short of pausing the game and selecting to restart.  Combine this with car controls that feel like your driving over oil slick all the time, and you'll get bored after the initial hour of humorous collisions.  The overall look of the game seems like it was ported from a PlayStation or N64.  Textures have a washed out look and despite a frame rate that runs quite smoothly, it's nothing near the speed of Crazy Taxi.  Pop-up occurs with frightening frequency and there are some definite collision problems; even with the craziness of crashes throughout the game, there are times where the collision detection should be solid... and it isn't.  And then, we have buggy gameplay; while driving the Scenic Drive track with Red Fox's truck, I came upon a small bridge and right as I was about to drive past it, my truck ~teleported~ a few spaces back behind the bridge.  I tried to drive over the bridge again, only to be ~teleported~ back to the same spot.  This is only one example of how buggy the game can be.  I can see the appeal that Super Runabout: SFE can have with younger players who don't know any better.  But to those wishing to make a smart purchase, Super Runabout: SFE may have enough gameplay for a couple hours romping.  But if you want a Dreamcast game where driving and crashing and the norm, go for something like Crazy Taxi that has some sensibility in being both a solid game and fun.  --Anthony ~Warning: Do not get this game~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 27, 2000"}
