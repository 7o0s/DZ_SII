Oh, and there was some backstage drama with marriages and mistresses, but this site doesn't peddle in that kind of salaciousness. (We peddle in this kind.) Thanks to Glu Mobile's relationship with 20th Century Fox, the movie has become a mobile game, allowing players to slip into the loafers and/or pumps of the titular couple.   The plot, much like a ~War of the Roses~ with sniper rifles, has John and Jane Smith on the defensive in their home. Apparently their decision to exit the assassin business has been met with some resistance -- the only way to end their contracts is to die. (Talk about your ~Non-Competitive Clauses.~) So the honeymooners team up to take out the enemy agents infiltrating suburbia, using cameras to sniff out fellow hitmen and guns to neutralize threats. The game takes place over three days, and as the ammo counts dwindle, tension between the sexes heats up, resulting in some witty (and not-so-witty) one-liners.   There are two weapons in the game. The pistol is your basic weapon, and it does only minimal damage. The rifle can execute enemies, but you have only a few shots per level. And both John and Jane have their individual talents. John can withstand more abuse from enemy agents while Jane has access to more ammunition. But playing as either one really doesn't have a large effect on the outcome of the game.    As you spy people walk down the street outside, you snap their picture with your camera. The camera will identify enemies, and then clue you into how much health they have. Once you spot an agent, you must switch to your gun and try to line up the crosshair to get in a killshot. If you miss, you alert the agent that you're on to him (or her), and then they return fire. You must then try to snipe them quickly, lest your own health meter run out.   The biggest problem with Mr. & Mrs. Smith -- and it's a doozy -- is that the game really isn't much fun. The game feels kind of like a carnival shooting gallery with a little Sam Fisher-style recon to add depth where none exists. Switching back and forth between the camera to blast similar-looking agents walking back and forth across the exact same backdrop -- outside your home. The game play just gets old way faster than it should.   Mr. & Mrs. Smith becomes repetitive quickly -- as the shooting action changes about as often as the background. The enemies never really behave differently. They just run from side to side and shoot when shot at. After two or three levels, you may struggle to keep with it.   Mr. & Mrs. Smith isn't a bad-looking game, just a boring one. The suburban street looks fine -- but it's the only one you've got. The enemy agents both look the same, no matter how many you've shot and left in the middle of the street. Neither the likeness of Brad Pitt nor Angelina Jolie appear in-game.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a snoozer. Not bad -- but boring. After Glu's excellent mobile take on Fox's Kingdom of Heaven, I had high expectations, but what the firm delivers is a one-note shooter that offers none of the variety needed to keep a game like this going. The same level? The same enemies? Even Deer Hunter offered more variety than this. Pass.", "date": "Jun 17, 2005"}
