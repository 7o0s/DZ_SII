Requiring very little work, Konami -- holding a vast backlog of classics -- has been able to release four of these titles in the space of a year. While this seems to be an obvious cash-in, the releases have actually been of a surprisingly high quality: a generally worthy choice of inclusions have demonstrated that older games can be just as worthy as the new blood, far more skillfully than any other company's retro-compilations. The forth title, however, could be said to demonstrate that Konami's running out of classics, including two sequels to games from the first installment. Also present are two games from 1985 -- is Konami clutching at straws, or can these games still make the grade?  Features: Gradius II, Castlevania II, Antarctic Adventure and Yie Ar Kung Fu Variable levels of difficulty.  Password Save. For Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Konami GB Collection Volume 4 is divided into four specific games, the majority of which existed on the Game Boy back in the dominating black and white days  Gradius II -- Return of the Hero: The first of the sequels, Gradius II is nothing new. Though it's not necessarily a bad game, it follows the formula laid out by the original to the letter: complain all you want about the first two Tomb Raiders holding only superficial differences -- compared to this and its prequel, they're two entirely different games. There's nothing here to make it a worthier choice than any of Konami's other shoot-`em-ups. Five levels must be blasted through, four of which can be played freestyle in the training mode. Power-ups can be collected from defeated enemies, such as extra speed and pods that float alongside your ship to add their firepower to your own. All the items are pretty much identical to those found in the prequel, so there's little in the way of surprises. In terms of difficulty, it's slightly harder than most shoot-`em-ups I've played, due mainly to the frustrating scarcity of restart points. As with most such games, one hit means death, in addition to the loss of any neat weapons acquired. The backgrounds may be a touch more detailed, and the bosses that await you at the end of each level might be slightly more fearsome -- but playability-wise at least, this in no way exceeds the quality of the original. That's not necessarily a bad thing: if you love shoot-`em-ups, you'll love this. Just don't expect any innovations. Still, it's the gameplay that matters, and Gradius II can more than hold its own. So far, each GB Collection title has been opened by a near-identical shooter. Konami may want to stop being so predictable.  Castlevania II -- Belmont's Revenge:  This, on the other hand, is a brilliant example of why many believe the Castlevania games to be Konami's flagship series.  With the vampires, ghouls and other creatures of the night yet again causing trouble, Christopher Belmont, vampire hunter, must fight his way through the four castles that have appeared over the land in an attempt to reach the final battle against Dracula himself. A man's work is never done, especially if he's the chosen one. The game is set up very much like one of the classic Mega Man titles: the four castles each comprise a stage, and they can be tackled in any order, giving the player an impressive amount of freedom. Once they have all been conquered, Dracula's Castle can be entered, granting access to the final three levels. Castlevania II is roughly twice as long as its prequel, the main improvement being the handy password system that makes an otherwise Herculean task remotely possible. Each stage is long and packed with some incredibly tricky set pieces, which lead to even harder bosses. The game borrows the idea of separate weapons from the original NES outing: some candles, when destroyed, reveal either holy water or a cross, which can be used, at the cost of a heart, in projectile attacks. Holding one of these hardly guarantees victory, however. As I said in my review of the original, it's easy to see why Castlevania 64 has been accused of watering down the series.  Fortunately, the game has been put together well enough to ensure that deaths are only ever the fault of the player and that gradually working your way through the levels is always enjoyable. Unlike in the prequel, the screen never flickers and, despite the many enemies, there is no slowdown. Though small and lacking all but the simplest color-schemes, the graphics are fairly detailed and appropriately dark and atmospheric. The music, also, helps to maintain the gothic atmosphere -- the tracks have a lot of variety and, unlike in most games, suit the action perfectly.  Why can't the games made today be this much fun?   Antarctic Adventure:  A Konami GB Collection title simply wouldn't be complete without the inevitable dud -- and it becomes clear a few seconds into the game that this is it.  You control a penguin, which has decided, for some reason, to run across the world from country to country, perhaps on an ambitious pub-crawl. The game is viewed in basic third-person, looking very much like a racing game. The penguin sprints into the screen, its speed controlled by the up and down arrows on the pad. Your job is to reach the end of the level before the time limit is up, avoiding the many obstacles on the way.  Unfortunately, that's all there is to it: there's all the complexity of a Game and Watch title. It's simply a matter of moving the penguin left and right at the appropriate time to avoid the cracks and holes in the ice. The speed isn't really an issue, as you need to run at nearly full pelt to meet the time limits anyway. All the levels are pretty much identical, save for such innovation as a different colored sky every once in a while. Grabbing the fish that leap from some of the holes gives you extra points, but the dull gameplay offers no incentive whatsoever to do this.  The graphics must have been fairly impressive back in 1985. The surprisingly fast scrolling creates a worthy 3d effect, despite the fact that it seems to jerk in stages rather than run smoothly. Other than that, though, there's little of note: save for the penguin sprite, which is anything but detailed, the screen remains pretty bare throughout. It must be said that the game can become fairly absorbing; though I suspect this is due to the monotonous gameplay and the slow, repetitive music putting the player in a trance-like state, in which quitting and playing Castlevania II instead takes too much effort.  An insomniac's dream.   Yie Ar Kung Fu: Though the Street Fighter series is widely heralded as the one that made fighting games as popular as they are today, the first recognizable one-on-one beat-'em-up, Yie Ar Kung Fu, came many years before. It's a surprising, somewhat brave inclusion -- but one that is likely to get retro-gamers drooling. The game appears, at first, to be incredibly shallow. The graphics lack all but the most basic details, and the control scheme allows only simple punches and kicks. Combining these with presses of the d-pad executes high and low attacks, but there are no special moves or flashy techniques. Each match lasts for only one round; if you win, you advance to fight the next opponent.  You'll soon realize that this simplistic formula fails to stop the game from being addictive, almost more so than it deserves to be. The action is incredibly fast-paced, and the soon-discovered ability to bounce from the arena walls adds more depth than is originally apparent: the later enemies, able to fire different sorts of projectiles, require some skill in beating. It's intensely playable -- great, hectic fun.  Despite there only being five enemies, the game has a surprisingly long lifespan, due to it being more about high-score chasing than merely defeating all the opponents: once the last one has been overcome, you return to the beginning of the game, only now everything is a touch harder.  A definite winner. Once again, Konami has come up trumps. Of the four games included, only one is a waste of effort -- the others have all passed the test of time admirably. If you have fond memories of playing these games when they were originally around, or if you're simply looking for a collection of excellent titles at a great price, you should definitely consider getting down to your import dealer.Note: Konami GB Collection Vol.4 is currently only available in Europe -- Konami has no plans on bringing this game to the US.
