Courtesy of Konami's Osaka-based KCEO team, Yasuo Daikai and Kazuhiko Uehara's Hybrid Heaven may look like an action game clone a la Metal Gear Solid or Mission: Impossible, but gamers looking for arcade frills will find very little to like in this sci-fi drama that's part X-Files: Fight the Future and part Futureworld.StoryDecember 2000. US President Weller is slated to arrive in New York City to finalize an anti-nuclear weapons agreement with his Russian counterpart. Little does he know that a secret invasion plan is underway, orchestrated by a race of genetically engineered hybrid clones that are hiding in a giant underground facility somewhere underneath the city of New York. But when the clone of secret service agent Johnny Slater heads out to aide the invasion forces, he has a fateful encounter with another hybrid named Diaz who is waiting for him in a subway station along with two men in black. Driven by mysterious voices in his head, Diaz pulls out a gun and shoots Slater, much to the surprise of his two accomplices. What's going on here? That's up to you to find out as you jump into the role of the disoriented Diaz and explore miles of underground tunnels and cloning facilities.GameplayHybrid Heaven is indeed a hybrid of action and roleplaying. However, the action elements are fairly straightforward. Controlling the main character, players run around the 3D environments much like in Konami's own Castlevania. The whip and sword have been replaced by a painfully wimpy weapon called the Defuser (don't get your hopes up, it doesn't get more powerful), enemies that can be ~defused~ are limited to floating laser probes and mouse bots, and the deadly guillotine traps that plagued Schneider have made way for equally pesky flame barriers.Controls seem inspired by Metal Gear Solid. The protagonist  let's call him Diaz to keep things simple  can walk, run, dash (all done via the analog stick), jump (A), hang on to ledges (automatic), climb up ladders and boxes (push forward), talk to NPCs [non-player characters] (A), examine and pick up objects (push forward), look around (hold C Up -- again, the same control scheme as in MGS) open doors (push forward), aim his defuser (holding down R), shoot (A) and even crawl to get into tight places (Z). B switches on a small, Zelda-style map display in the lower right corner and C Left and C Right let you look around. The somewhat adjustable camera usually stays behind Diaz, but also shows side and top views during key sequences. The controls work fine most of the time, but there are also quite a few moments where the player will end up getting hurt because the view gets forced into a particular perspective, leaving you disoriented and running into the wrong direction.The action during these exploration sequences is only mildly amusing. Avoid the traps, climb a box, shoot an electronic lock, update your key card and get to the next area. If this was all the game was about, Hybrid Heaven would really be in trouble. Luckily, there's more to this game than first meets the eye.Whenever Diaz encounters an enemy (human, robots, an ~biogenetically enhanced~ creatures), the game's RPG heritage becomes apparent. You can usually see your opponents from far away, but there are also times where an enemy will beam into the room from a designated ~spawning point~ (if you leave the room, another one will appear in the same location) or drop in on you from the ceiling. If you don't want to fight, you can try and run away or around your opponent and get to an exit before the creature catches up. However, doing so means depriving your character of valuable battle experience.Once you get close to the enemy, the game will switch to a cleverly executed battle sequence. Unlike in menu-driven RPGs like Final Fantasy, players can still move around  similar to a 3D fighting game. Like in Bushido Blade, you can even hold down the Z Button and run around the room without facing your enemy, although this will cost the player valuable stamina points. While you're moving (or standing), your character's power meter will slowly fill up. Once it passes a certain point, you can attack. Pressing the A Button will bring up a series of menus that let you select the attack of choice. For example, you can press A, then select ~Punch~, then the type of punch you want to execute. If you're close enough to your enemy, the punch will hit and cause a certain amount of damage. The amount of hitpoints you will cause your opponent to lose all depends on your power and stamina meters, the enemy's condition and your character's status. Hit your opponent on the same spot a few times and he/she/it will become injured and more susceptible to attacks in that area (the spot will start to flash in red). In addition to kicking and punching, players can not only evade, reverse or block attacks and use items to heal themselves (or attack the enemy), but even pull off combo moves once their power meter is expanded to at least two units. If you don't like the pre-made combos the game's developers put in the combo menu, you'll be happy to hear that you can put together your own ones as well.But there's more. If you get close to your opponents, you can grab a hold of them and pull off a number of wrestling and martial arts moves. You can attack opponents both from the front or from the back (different moves become available depending on your relative position to the enemy) and even follow up with back breakers, neck locks and foot stomps once the opponent is down. Your opponents can of course do the same to you, so correct timing and balancing of the power and stamina meters is key to kicking your adversary's butt without losing too much energy yourself.As a special little twist, players have to learn every one of their attack moves by having them done to them first. It may hurt if your enemy grabs a hold of you and pulls a screwpile driver on you, but if you survive, you will add this move to your own list of attacks. This learning system adds more incentive to wanting to battle opponents, instead of simply running away. Another element borrowed from many traditional RPGs is the level-up system. Killing creatures will earn the player experience points that will eventually upgrade the main character's stamina, offensive and defensive powers, speed, reflexes and hitpoints. Ever played Quest 64? Remember how you could basically beat the whole game by using one single magic spell? Hybrid Heaven's designers came up with a neat little idea to lessen the danger of ~repetitive attack syndrome~. Every time you attack with a certain body part (head, arm, leg), that body part's offensive power goes up. Every time you get hit on a certain part of your body, that part's defensive power goes up. It's important to maintain a good balance and keep both legs and arms equally strong as some of the later opponents, for example, resist punches rather well. After each battle, players are ranked and see what new moves or powers they have gained.This battle system will no doubt please RPG aficionados who have been looking for a serious RPG since the release of the N64  but it will also turn away just as many action fans who don't like their battles to be ~frozen~ every time they decide on an attack. To make things worse, Hybrid Heaven lacks the variety of attacks found in many other RPGs. While there are a huge number of punches, kicks and moves, don't expect to see any magic attacks or permanent weapons in this game. Sure, there are five types of weapons that players can pick up during the game (flame shot, poison shot, ice shot, hurricane shot and ion shot), but they are sparse and confined strictly to one-time use as items. The total lack of a barter system and an equipment system also hurt the game, but our main complaint lies elsewhere.~I can't wait till we finally go over ground,~ says one of the bad guys in the game, referring to the imminent invasion. I couldn't agree with him more. In my opinion, RPGs are primarily driven by three different factors: Character development, story/scenario and location. While Hybrid Heaven's story isn't all that original, there are quite a few impressive cutscenes and story twists that keep the game interesting. However, where the game truly fails to deliver is in the ~location~ department. Yeah, we're underground, running through sometimes spectacularly lit metal tubes and hi-tech facilities. What's next? An elevator to a lower level, leading through differently textured tunnels and hi-tech facilities. What's behind that door? Why, could it be a whole level of ducts and tunnels and hi-tech facilities, this time lit by green lights? Where then, would this exit lead to? I think you know the answer. There are a few memorable locations in the game (running along catwalks underneath a giant space ship's fuselages comes to mind), as well as some truly original gameplay sequences (defeat two giant monsters without ever attacking), but after seeing hi-tech ducts for 10 straight hours, players will REALLY be ready for a change of scenery. When it finally comes, the game is over. A city, a waterlogged mine, an old bunker  anything but another hi-tech facility with motion-detecting probes.In the end, players are left with a sometimes very original, but often repetitive RPG/action hybrid that fares well in two genres, but is master of neither.MultiplayerWhat, an RPG with a multiplayer mode? Well, don't expect a co-op quest, but Hybrid Heaven does sport an addictive little bonus mode for monster battle fans. You can take any of the creatures you have unlocked in the one-player mode and send it into battle against a human opponent. While the combat is similar to the single-player mode's battle system, the controls have been changed so that the second player can't see what attacks you choose. An additional Creature Battle mode (for one player only) lets you do battle against the computer if a second player isn't available.GraphicsEven though Hybrid Heaven looks nothing like the two renders Konami chose to put on the box (it's time Konami of America got the ability to take its own screenshots, methinks), the game manages to impress with mostly smooth framerates and some excellent lighting effects. On the downside, the game suffers from some of the same problems as KCEK's Castlevania. Especially the earlier levels are home to blurry and unappealing texture design and the larger areas can cause quite a bit of slowdown  considering the fact that Hybrid Heaven isn't an action game per se, the slowdown isn't really a problem, though. Later on, the increasingly darker environments are often doused in eerie lights, with cool looking neon glows and some truly impressive machinery. Character design ranges from ridiculous to pretty good. Diaz himself wears perhaps the most ugly clothes I've ever seen in a videogame, but thankfully, players don't have to look too long at his '70s-style duds. The other human characters and robots mostly look great, but the 30 or so creatures in the game will make you laugh more than inspire fear. My favorites are still ~Red Pajama Man~, a seriously silly looking Elmo gone bad who drops down from the ceiling like Resident Evil's ~licker~ -- and of course Lama Man. Oh, then there is the skirt-wearing Naos who drops health power-ups when hit. But I still have nightmares over Lama Man...Some of the larger areas in this game really push the N64's abilities in terms of drawing power, a fact that becomes painfully obvious when using the optional hi-res or hi-res letterbox mode. Why these were included is anyone's guess, as the added RAM doesn't help a bit when the game chugs along at 15fps even in letterbox mode. But who cares, the game looks fine in low-res. Play it in the standard resolution.Like most of Konami's games, the game is loaded with narrative cutscenes that drive the story along. Although most of the in-game scenes don't contain speech, the long opening shows what can be achieved with realtime cinematics when it's done right. I'm still not sure whether the Hybrid Heaven designers were deliberately trying to be funny when naked Johnny opens his apartment's door and listens to his boss's speech in the nude (notice the guy's blank stare?), but it's obvious that a lot of work went into these cutscenes  and the effort definitely pays off.SoundIf there's one company that delivers great sound no matter what storage media it's using, then it's Konami. Hybrid Heaven is no exception, with great sound effects all around and some of the eeriest music on N64. With the exception of the defuser gun sound (seriously, shooting a gun that sounds like a someone getting whipped with spaghetti noodles is not fun), the game's stereo audio impresses on all levels. The background music (usually a carpet of strings with plenty of low bass notes and the occasional choir or creature scream thrown in to make it even creepier) perfectly sets the tone for the whole adventure. And when the action really gets going, the soundtrack teeters somewhere between Final Fantasy and Terminator. Good job.Peripheral SupportHybrid Heaven is the first US Konami title to support the Rumble Pak. Although the Japanese release of the game featured a built-in EEPROM, players will need a Controller Pak (and at least 53 notes) to save their game. Additionally, players can save their creature data and even copy data between two memory paks.Hybrid Heaven really grew on me. At first, I was a little disappointed by the ho-hum action in the exploration mode, but once I got into upgrading my character and learning new moves, I was hooked. If you're the type who easily gets bored with the turn-based battles in many of the Japanese roleplaying games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy, then you may want to stay away from this game  the action is not enough to carry it. But if you're a sucker for ~battle and training~ games  and you would like to see a game unlike any other on Nintendo 64, then Hybrid Heaven is definitely worth a look. Like most of Konami's games, Hybrid Heaven doesn't last too long, so bear that in mind before you decide on whether to buy or to rent.", "date": "Sep 11, 1999"}
