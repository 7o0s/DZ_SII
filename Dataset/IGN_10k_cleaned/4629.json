Developed by the talented Amplified Games, bolstered by THQ's strong oush into the wireless gaming space, does The Punisher continue the trend of good movies-to-games? Or is this just another Fury of the Hulk?   Features:  Full Marvel license  First-person perspective  Story Mode and Arcade Mode  Follow's film's storyline   If you aren't familiar with the Punisher and his skull-bearing t-shirt, you have a gift for avoiding media onslaughts that we'd love you to share with us. The Marvel comics character, a vigilante on the warpath after his family is viciously gunned-down, is a welcome change of pace from the fire-shooting, lightning-causing mutants and freaks that have made it to the screen lately. The Punisher has no superpowers, just a lot of guns and a talent for killing.   So, naturally the mobile game is an action title. But rather than a side-scrolling platformer/shooter, as you might expect, Amplified Games zeroed in on the shooting portion of the Punisher's moves list. What they have created is essentially Silent Scope, without the scope. And even though that sounds derisive, it's not -- because The Punisher works.   There are eight locations that Castle sets up shop in, dealing out death to an almost endless supply of henchmen. (Where does villain Howard Saint find so much cannon fodder?) From shootouts in the street to shootouts on the docks, players control Castle's crosshairs, training them on bad guys. This being The Punisher, there is a variety of boom-boom on hand, including a shotgun, machinegun, and a face-removing .45.   The environments are static-screen, but players do control the view with their thumbs. As you move the crosshairs to one side of the screen, the level scrolls over to reveal more real estate. Should a bad guy pop up on part of the environment not currently on-screen, a little red arrow alerts you that trouble is just beyond the periphery.   There are two play modes in The Punisher: Story and Arcade. Arcade is just a quick game, throwing you into one of the levels and allowing you to blast away. Story Mode, however, does indeed follow the events of the film. Should you wish to remain spoiler-free, then maybe you shouldn't play too far into the game just yet. (But c'mon, do you really think Castle won't live to see his revenge?)   The Punisher looks pretty good for what it is, a shooting gallery. Have we seen better-looking mobile games? Of course, but that doesn't distract from the fun at all. The game is about shooting people in the head, not gazing at the horizon. The game does open up with a little tune, but then quickly falls quiet -- the silence punctured by the uninspiring ~crink!~ of gunshots.  The Punisher reminds me of an old SEGA Master System shooting game called Gangster Town. I enjoyed that game immensely when I was a kid, and I enjoy The Punisher now for what it is. Does Amplified Game advance the ball with The Punisher? Not really, but they keep the bad rep of movie games at bay, and that's an accomplishment in itself.", "date": "Apr 7, 2004"}
