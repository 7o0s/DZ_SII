And with good reason. The game, which is like a digitized impression of every Los Angeles based cop movie you can think of, just beckons for the proper whoriding musical accompaniment. Thankfully, the likes of Snoop, Suga Free, Warren G., Bizzy Bone, and the West Side Connection step up to the plate and deliver a spate of bass tweaking burners.   Where The Streets of LA True Crime: The Soundtrack really succeeds is in the fact that the 20 track album features all new material written specifically for the game. That means when you plunk down your hard earned cheddar for this CD you're getting brand spanking new bumps for your trunk.   The album pops off with the slick and creamy smooth exploits of Snoop Dogg on the laid back super soul slink of ~Dance Wit Me.~ It's one of Snoops better recent performances, as it rolls along to a decidedly '70s Curtis Mayfield-era blaxploitation vibe (although the song is actually comprised of a Marvin Gaye sample) while Snoop drawls about movin', groovin', and soothin'.    While the lead off track may be purely mellow, the next track kicks the gangsta lean into overdrive. Aptly titled ~Terrorist Threat,~ it presents the triple threat of Mack 10, Ice Cube, and WC in their incendiary Westside Connection configuration. The track begins with a recorded voice extolling ~An open microphone can be dangerous,~ then scratches and chugging synth kick in as WC takes the first stab, followed by Mack 10, and culminating with Cube. A chugging, thuggish blast of low-n-slow boom bap.   Nickel slick Suga Free gets swivvy over a freaky Kevin McCord interpolation of squiggling synth on ~Don't Fight The Pimpin',~ an upbeat jammy about livin' the high life. Free flexes with a slight verbal nod to the king of Cali rap pimps, Too $hort, and that's fine by me, as it's bugged out and fancy free.    Warren G. and RBX come with the eerie twist on the ~Funky Worm~ wash of electronica on ~What U Wanna Do.~ The track is dark, creepy, and hearkens back to the second wave of LA gangsta rap, when cats took it into the nether realms of Stygian murk and gloom. RBX's commanding verbal lope offsets Warren's laid back sneer rather well. If you like your tunes on the evil tip, this will hit you righteously.   Police sirens blare in and out of the chunky thunder blitz of ~True Crime Remix (The New West Edition)~, which features Young Dre, Bishop Lamont, Black & Sixx John. But just as the album seems to be dipping into the darker side of West Coast rap, Damizza and N.U.N.E come with the uncharacteristically upbeat ~I'll Do Anything.~ Owing a huge debt to the early Egyptian Lover, electro-rock days of LA rap, as well as to the inventive vocoder drenched funk of Roger Troutman, the track comes off like a cross between roller disco funk and new wave madness. Truly bugged.  Jay-o-Felony takes it back to the low-n-slow grind on ~Thug Night (Let Me See Something),~ a somewhat lascivious ode to the female form and wanting to see more of it exposed. Bizzy Bone follows up with ~Hollywood,~ yet another track that incorporates samples of sirens and police scanner gaga underneath a chunky, electro reverberated beat. Bizzy's high pitched delivery seems a bit out of place with the deeper octaves of some of the other emcees that have preceded him, but he rides the beat tightly.   Interestingly enough an MC/singing combo by the name of Hollywood, follows the aforementioned Bizzy track. ~Drinks In The Air~ is a cool, almost refreshing blast of post-modern R&B slink, a sing-song wisp of romance and sex set to a flamenco guitar loop and throbbing bass. But the good times, lady loving vibe is quickly shattered by the thug chug of Kam, Cavie, and Above The Law on the turgid ~Don't Do The Crime.~ The cadence of this track is simplistically relentless, pounding into your body with non-stop piano plinks and boomin' bass.   The Boo Yaa Tribe represent with the orchestrally inclined ~Legends,~ which is wrapped in stutter serpentine synth and interweaving basslines. The music is a confusing rush of intermingling rhythms and leftfield whirs and funky blips. Captivating as the beats worm their way underneath the various flows of the Tribe members.    The rest of the album features turns from Dee Dimes with Big Swoop (the hypnotic ~They Don't Know~), Sly Boogy (the gurgling burble slank of ~Flow~), Lil  Dead, Showtime, Kon-troversy & Quicktomac (the call-and-response driven ~This Is How We Live~), Soul star ( a femme fatale who delivers the herky-jerky groove of ~We Don't Stop~), Big Tray, Short Khop & Threat (~Can't F@#k With Us,~ a track that suffers from one of the emcees sound an awful lot like Eminem), The Pomona City Rydaz featuring Lil  Dead (~Do Time~), and Stylistik  (the swervin' ~Cali Folks).   The album's two most interesting cuts come from some definite young guns. First up are the Young Billionaires. Let's just say that the youthful pre-teens sound unintentionally funny as they deliver their best gangsta strut on ~Roll Wit Me.~ And the album climaxes with Lil' Eazy E, the son of the infamous N.W.A. member. Lil' sounds a bit older than the YBs and he's lackin' the high-pitched twang of his pops, plus he spends a fair amount of time copping the ~izzle~ inflections of Snoop. But the faux Middle Eastern groove that runs underneath him is pretty sweet.   The most interesting thing is that for all intents and purposes the West Coast gangsta scene, musically speaking, has more of less run its course, succumbing to the bling and blitz of the Dirty South. But this album proves that it's still alive and well. Whatever your take on the gunz-n-thugs mentality may be, one thing can't be denied: the 20 tracks included here are rife with game, style, and serious funktafication. The tracks are form fitted to be bumped in the ride, tossed into the mix at the club or for bonus booty shakin' fodder at your next house party. Just keep the guns locked down on safety, fool.", "date": "Nov 1, 2003"}
