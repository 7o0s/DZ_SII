But there's nothing quite like the original, so Konami is bringing the professor's first romp to the smallest screen.   Fizzwizzle fans will find fewer stages in the mobile edition, but the core game play is intact. As the professor, you must negotiate a series of ledges by manipulating boxes and barrels. There are sci-fi toys to help your endeavors, such as freeze rays that make crates slide across sand and electromagnetic pulse guns that temporarily undo the hold of any nearby magnets. The ultimate goal is to somehow get from Fizzwizzle's starting gate to an escape pod of sorts, but this only sends the professor off to another stage for more action-puzzle antics.   I had a pretty good time with Fizzwizzle, actually. The first 20 stages are designed to get you familiar with the game mechanics, such as how to run on barrels and use items. These stages pose little challenge, but once you graduate to the second batch of 20 stages, look out. The difficulty is significantly boosted, but not to the point of hopeless frustration. The solution always feels just within your grasp, you just may have to replay a stage several times (pressing zero restarts the puzzle) several times to discover the solution. Just use the look feature to check out the entire board and try to work your way backwards from the exit.   With 60 puzzles, you should get a few hours of play out of Professor Fizzwizzle, making it a solid value. That's nowhere near the 230 stages found in the PC download, but for a portable edition at a fraction of the price, you're getting some good puzzle thrills. My only complaint is that the game looks like minimal effort was put into the Professor's appearance. The itty-bitty Fizzwizzle sprite shows zero expression. The levels sport a small amount of detail. The game isn't ugly by any means, but you'll never confuse this with the grade-A visuals found in Gameloft or Digital Chocolate productions.   I spent a few nights deciphering the puzzles in Professor Fizzwizzle, downloaded to my LG VX8600. I enjoyed the game quite a bit (I love puzzle games where you have to deconstruct a scene), but was really disappointed with the so-so visuals. Fizzwizzle deserves better because it is a good game -- and good games deserve a nice visual polish to impress players that are swayed by graphics as much as game play.", "date": "Aug 14, 2007"}
