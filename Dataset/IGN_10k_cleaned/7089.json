They're no stranger to the Game Boy Advance, or Activision for that matter. The latest in the long line of mutant powered action brawlers is X-Men: The Official Game developed by Wayforward Technologies. With so many X-Games to choose from, this genetic defect is doomed for obscurity.   X-Men is a run of the mill sidescrolling platformer. You control Wolverine, Iceman, Colossus, and Nightcrawler to fight through 17 levels and 10 bosses.   X-Men: The Official Game attempts to bridge the gap between the films X-Men 2 and 3. Professor Xavier's gifted mutants return to Alkali Lake to retrieve pieces of Dark Cerebro. The story is told through text scrolling cut scenes. Each character's lines are accompanied by a stylized drawing of them not unlike what you would see in the current comic books. The story itself is flimsy, at best and is certainly not necessary to enjoy the newest film. The story attempts to offer an explanation for Nightcrawler's absence from the movie, but that too is pretty weak. You will face a variety of super villains in your mission. Sabertooth, Juggernaut, Mystique and even X23 (for those of you that don't read the comics, think Wolverine as a girl) all make appearances in the game. We may seem nitpicky complaining about the story for a handheld game, but for an officially licensed movie game, we expect the story not to create gaping plot holes for the film itself.   Each character has their own abilities, and you are able to switch between the characters on the fly. This is a nice change from the average platformer and the game encourages you to switch between the characters. For instance, powerups will be hidden in places that only Nightcrawler can teleport too, or there will be large objects that only Colossus can break open. By holding the left shoulder button, you can pick which of the four superheroes to choose. By tapping the shoulder button once, the previously selected character is automatically switched in. This makes it easy to rapidly switch between just two characters, which is all you really need. While the four characters do have unique abilities, the only ones of interest are Wolverine's healing factor, and Nightcrawler's teleportation. Wolverine will slowly heal as he fights, which makes him pretty much the only character necessary for fighting. You'll find yourself fighting a few bad guys, then standing back to heal before continuing, and this will become the formula for the rest of the game. Sound dull? Well it is. Having three other characters to choose from is great, but they're all either substantially weaker (Iceman, Nightcrawler) or slower (Colossus) to be of much use. The ability to combine characters for special attacks is a missed opportunity that would have helped spice up the gameplay.   Like many platformers, the team of superheroes is forced to work their way through the overused long hallway levels, sprinkled with ledges to jump between. The design for the levels is pretty monotonous. Except for one level, the entire game takes place in the military compound, and all of these levels are very similar looking, making the game feel repetitive. The design is basic, bordering on the overly simplistic. The challenge is not in the levels themselves, but is instead presented by way of hundreds of bad guys to kill. Because there are only about a half a dozen different enemies, you'll be fighting the same generic soldier guy over and over.   Having four characters to play as offers a chance for a variety of gameplay elements. Sadly, X-Men is monotonous, each character playing nearly identically. You'll be mashing the attack button the entire time, slowly making your way though the levels. Power ups are scattered through the levels, including tokens to revive fallen members of your team. Since defeated enemies drop health packs so often, reviving your team becomes unnecessary as they will probably never even run out of health. Fighting bad guys increases the character's energy bar, which can be used to unleash a type of ~fury mode.~ The hero's attacks are increased four times, allowing them to plow through enemies faster. This mode becomes useful in the boss battles. With a simple tap of the right shoulder button, long drawn out fights become 15 second slugfests. Seeing some of the greatest villains in the X-Men universe go down so quickly is disappointing. The entire game is too easy and offers no real challenge, something expect more from a kid's title.   The only time that you will come close to dying is when your character is surrounded by enemies, and that's because the controls for X-Men are unresponsive. The attacks are slow, even for the quickest character. To make matters worse, when your character gets hit they immediately stop attacking, jumping, or running. It's possible to get hit three or four times before you can manage to get a swipe in. Fighting feels more like a scripted fight scene, or a turn based RPG. Good guy attack, bad guy blinks. Bad guy attacks, good guy blinks. Repeat. There's no strategy involved since the attacks cannot be combined.   Considering the game's short length and lack of extras or gameplay variety, we'd hope that the title at least looked nice. Unfortunately X-Men's graphics manage to be anything but super powered. The character models and animations are decent, but lack a level of fluidity. The enemies are even choppier, only having a couple poses. Soldiers will stand up, and then lay down, with no frames in between. There is a nice layered effect in a few levels with the backgrounds being set slightly off from the foreground. It creates a neat effect when running down the many hallways. The cut scenes, while simple, have a nice comic book feel. The characters could have used a few more poses though, especially since they're not even animated.   X-Men has a soundtrack that actually changes through the level. The songs will rise or fall in pitch and tempo as you encounter enemies. However, this really isn't noticeable. The sound effects of the characters attacking becomes all that's really audible, and after hearing each slash, punch, ice beam, bamf and gunfire hundreds of times over, you'll probably be sliding the volume down. The complete lack of voices is also a disappointment. A couple phrases would have been nice, especially since the other official X-Men games boast voice work by the actors.  License games have a habit of being terrible and gamers have come to expect that any game based on a movie (especially a summer movie) is going to be worthless. X-Men isnt the worst game weve ever seen, but that doesnt mean its worth buying. The game shows potential for a suitable platformer, but is missing the flair and fast paced action needed to stay interesting. For people dying for an X-Men game on the GBA, go search out X2: Wolverines Revenge at a garage sale or the internet. If you need to play a current X-Men game, theres an official game on all the major consoles right now and is more worth your time.", "date": "Jul 27, 2006"}
