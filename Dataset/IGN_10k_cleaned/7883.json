Rocky Legacy allows fans to chart the boxer's storied history, acting out the fights from each film, such as the re-match with Apollo Creed and the back alley brawl with Tommy Gunn is the near-universally loathed Rocky V. (Hey, if this is going to be a complete Rocky experience, you must take the bad with the good.)   1.5.07 Update: Just so you know -- there are multiple Rocky mobile games. Rocky Balboa, which is different from Rocky Legacy or Rocky: Apollo's Fall, is launching soon. Expect a review of that game (a 3D boxer based on the actual sixth movie) shortly.   The biggest problem with this formula is that SkyZone's boxer is almost entirely scripted. This is fine for passive entertainment, like a film, but it fundamentally goes against the concept of a video game -- user interaction. If it happened in the movie, it's going to happen that way in the game. The first fight with Apollo ends in a loss, so you only have to survive five rounds without being knocked out. That's a fine objective, but when you first fight Clubber Lang, you are going to be savagely beaten, no matter what. And by no matter what, I mean that I brutalized Lang with vicious body blows and took him to the mat twice via teeth-rattling haymakers. But then, Lang suddenly hits me with five punches that cleave huge chucks of Rocky's stamina -- far more than any normal punch up to this point -- and knocks me out with no hope of getting up, no matter how quickly I jam the button to climb to my feet.   Yes, that's what happened in the movie. But then why waste my time with the preordained fight? Why not just show the highlights of the fight in a cutscene and then let me play through the training Rocky needed to get back in the ring with Lang? I complete understand the decisions that lead up to Rocky Legacy's design, but I just believe that predestination belongs in Calvinism, not video games. Other plot points in the movies are told via dialogue scenes, such as Mickey's heart attack or Rocky's downfall that leads to the circumstances of the unfortunate Rocky V. In many ways, Rocky Legacy is like a highlight reel, and perhaps ultra-fans can roll with that and be perfectly content.   Rocky Legacy strays from the plot when you play challenge mode, which lets you play individual contests with boxers unlocked during story mode. You'll see Apollo in his America flag trunks square off against Tommy Gunn in a back alley, for example.   Between fights, you must step into the ring with trainers to beef up Rocky's three stats: Speed, strength, and stamina. The more you train, the more better ~hurtin' bombs~ you develop. You must train at least once between the fights to unlock the next challenge, but you are allowed as many times as you like in the training ring to increase your stats up to the next ceiling. Rocky has a limit on how much speed or strength he can have before a new fight, and once you reach it, you're maxed out until the completion of the bout. For example, you develop strength through body blows. Every few successful body blows you land grants Rocky +1 strength. If the cap is 40 and you achieve that, you can keep on using body blows in training, but you no longer see +1. Does training really matter? To some degree, yes -- as long as the next fight is not one that has a preordained outcome.   The boxing mechanics are simplified -- maybe too much after playing Glu's superlative arcade-like Super KO Boxing or EA Mobile's sim Fight Night Round 3. Pressing up jabs, pressing down unleashes a body blow. You pull back by pressing to the right or block by pressing left. Be careful about pulling back too much, because you can get pressed up against the ropes and then you're at a considerable disadvantage. The only time you can use a haymaker punch (mapped to OK or 5) is when you've sapped your opponent of health and they look dizzy. This punch knocks the other fighter to the mat. You can never use any other time to maybe catch the other boxer off-guard. Once you get a rhythm, it's not too hard to pummel your opponent with a few quick jabs and a pair of body blows before throwing up a block.   Rocky Legacy looks a lot like a classic 8-bit game, with decently detailed sprites (Rocky's appropriately muscly, Drago's hair defies gravity) and little character portraits that deliver dialogue snippets. On some handsets, such as the Sony Ericsson w800i, the game is letterboxed to look more cinematic and display more of the ring -- but the boxers are smaller. Music plays over menus, but during fights, you hear little cracks when punches land, a grunt when a haymaker makes contact, and a bell at the end of each round.  I confess, I'm something of a Rocky fan -- I'll defend the clichs in Rocky IV any time. But I didn't have much fun with Rocky Legacy, thanks to the predestined fight outcomes in the story mode that must be played to unlock boxers and the too-simple controls. With two other rock solid boxers available on mobile right now (Super KO and Fight Night), recommending Rocky legacy gets even harder.", "date": "Jan 4, 2007"}
