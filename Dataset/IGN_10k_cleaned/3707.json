Whether surfing the Internet, listening to music, watching DVDs, or compiling the latest Linux kernel, game consoles have evolved into hybrid multimedia machines through intention, and not. One of the more notable software releases that melded game consoles with music creation was Codemaster's MTV Music Generator for the PSOne. With the said ~game,~ users could create beats and loops without the use of, say, a PC or a dedicated drum machine. Players could even output and record the sound using the console's audio I/O interface. As the market for this sort of thing is relatively niche (anyone dedicated to such a hobby assumingly has more flexible/powerful software), there has never been much competition in ways of like titles, but that hasn't stopped Magix from releasing Magix music maker for the PS2.  Magix music maker is more or less the equivalent of MTV Music Generator, sans the MTV license. Players can create beats, arrange loops, and even make corresponding music videos, though the videos are nothing more than Winamp-like plug-ins that produce bright colors and epileptic lighting patterns. All of this comes in a nice $10 package. Yep, you read that right. Walk into your local game store and you should be able to find Magix music maker for the same price as a night at the movies. Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.  The main navigation ~hub~ for music maker is the Studio. Here players will find a control panel of sorts that is divided into six virtual screens, each representing the interface for one of the six equipment selections. They are: the Work Screen, Control Monitor, the Mixer, the Video FX Screen, the Beatbox, and the Sampler. Let's start with the Work Screen. Think of the Work Screen as your canvas. Here you can arrange samples, choose sounds, see the video components; just about every general function is handled here in a timeline-based horizontal format that is relatively easy to use and analyze.   Then there is the Control Monitor which is really nothing more than a text interface used to load/save songs, start tutorials, fiddle with options, etc Exciting, we know. Next comes the Mixer, which lets you take individual tracks and tweak their volume, add effects, adjust the panning and the like. Again, very straightforward stuff, especially if you've used any similar programs or equipment. Moving right along, we get to the Beatbox. Using the Beatbox, you can create you own beats using the built-in samples and kits. Like the Work Screen, the interface uses a horizontal grid-like layout where you can assign different sounds to their proper place in the beat. The Sampler is the remaining piece of ~equipment,~ and it lets you create your own melodies by arranging and tweaking different notes on a timeline. For those who've used it, think the Piano Roll (though a bit simpler) in the excellent Fruityloops.   Now, as mentioned earlier, anyone who's used a music/beat recording/creating program like Fruityloops, Cool Edit, whatever, should not have too much trouble understanding what is going here. In fact, even those who've only used analog four-tracks, drum machines or similar devices should get a feel for things very quickly. So let's get to the good things about Magix music maker. First off, from a general standpoint, music maker is actually quite powerful. There are plenty of options, effects, and dials to toy with, making creating a unique and personal sound not too difficult. Of course, music maker can't quite compete against stand-alone products specializing in each of the corresponding areas, but there's more than one would expect in this very unassuming title. Also, the other big draw of the game is its price. At a measly ten bucks, you can pick this game up just for the hell of it without really feeling guilty if you don't like it. If you do, great. If you don't, well, who cares? You can keep it around strictly for novelty's sake.  Now the bad. First and foremost, what may restrict players from becoming the next Prefuse 73 is the unwieldy interface; using a controller to navigate through menus and such is just not very intuitive. If there were keyboard/mouse support and a more traditional window--styled interface, life would be much easier. But then again, that would somewhat defeat the purpose of making such a product for a console. Regardless, while not unusable -- far from it -- those without the patience to learn and understand the interface may get frustrated and give up. Fortunately, there are voiced tutorials that help, but oftentimes the tutorial will end or not go into enough detail.  Another big complaint, not necessarily about the game but more the limits of the console, is the inability to bring in and edit outside samples not included in the game. This may limit users from creating their ultimate opus, but then again, I doubt that the game was made for such a purpose. On a plus note, you can hook up the ~audio out~ of the PS2 to your PC or stereo and record your works for the entire world to hear. Overall, Magix music maker is a great buy at its price -- you get a lot and only pay a little. Its main competitor on the PS2 is MTV Music Generator 2 which can be found for roughly twice the price, but also offers a slightly easier interface and brings a more ~fun~ approach to the whole concept. Anyone seriously wanting to learn how to create beats, sequence loops, and pick up a few things about mixing but doesn't have the means or availability of more specialized programs/hardware should give Magix Music Maker a look. Even those already in the musical know-how may want to pick Music Maker just to try it out. After all, there really isn't much to lose.", "date": "Jun 10, 2003"}
