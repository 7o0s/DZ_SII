The Olympics are upon us once again, and it's time for the entire world to throw away their worries for a few weeks, and become predominantly engrossed in humanity's neverending conquest of athletic perfection. (Olympic participants will note that said perfection may be traded in for celebrity tie-ins, your face on a Wheaties box, and bucketloads of cold, hard cash, but we won't get into that.) And with every Olympics comes Olympics games from the four corners of the globe! Konami of Japan has fueled the Olympic torch with the release of the patriotic Ganbatte! Nippon! Olympic 2000 (or Go for it Japan! Olympic 2000), which winds up going head-to-head with Hitmaker's Virtua Athlete 2000 and Eidos' Sydney 2000 (neither of which are particularly hard acts to follow). Nevertheless, Konami has deftly managed to gum up the works, and has delivered a painfully average Track and Field knock-off that's roughly as productive as hitting your fingers with a hammer.  Upon starting the game, you're given two choices: Olympic Mode, where you can practice each of the game's twelve events, and Championship Mode, which forces you to go through the events in order. Before each event, the game gives you a quick tutorial, where you watch a liquid-metal athlete demonstrate how the event is played. Most events amount to ~mashing buttons then hitting another button,~ though there are a few interesting additions that manage to break the mold. Let's see how the mini-game stack up ...  100-Meter Dash The traditional staple of the track and field game. Alternate pressing the X and B buttons to run faster. Massage your crippled fingers afterwards. This is the nastiest of the events, requiring almost supernatural button-mashing skills  I had a miserable time placing in the top three with this event, and my chances of acquiring Carpal Tunnel Syndrome have increased by a factor of thirty-eight.   Long Jump Alternate pressing X and B to build up speed. When you reach the line in front of the sand pit, hold down the action button until the angle meter reads 30 degrees. This is basically identical to the Long Jump in both Decathlete and Virtua Athlete, but with a tick-mark at the 30-degree mark to eliminate some of the guesswork of the actual jump.   High Jump Almost identical to the Long Jump, Gameplay-wise  but with the ability to choose the height of the bar.  Pole Vault Alternate pressing X and B to build up speed. Once your vaulter reaches the line, he'll automatically drop the pole. Your job is to hit the action button when the ~timing~ bar reaches its apex, then hit the action button again when the ~recovery~ bar pops up. You don't do very much in this one, and I would have appreciated the ability to drop the pole myself. Ah well.   Horizontal Bar This one digresses a bit. After you hit the action button to start your routine, your on-screen persona starts swinging around the bar in a vomit-inducing fashion. A timing bar will zip up and down, and if you whack the action button at the right time, you initiate an aerial maneuver. Five arrows appear at the right of the screen, and you have to input them with the D-pad before time runs out (similar to the dancing in Bust-a-Groove). When you run out of time, your gymnast automatically does a perfect dismount. I only wish that the player would have the opportunity to screw up, since launching yourself twenty feet in the air and landing face-first equals uproariously funny (as long as it's in a game, you sickos). One of the more enjoyable events.  Vault Nearly identical to the Horizontal Bar  but with a chick jumping around instead.  Hammer Throw Work up your power by mashing X and B, then hit the action button when the swing meter hits the center. I find this one to be strangely addicting, not unlike the Jalapeno pepper-flavored Chee-tos you can only buy in Japan. Nevertheless, the grunts your character makes during the throw are somewhat disturbing  poor guy sounds like he's constipated. The post-event ~taunts~ are also some of the stupidest things you will ever see.  110-Meter Hurdles Essentially the same thing as the 100-Meter Dash, but with 10 extra meters, and hurdles to jump over. Timing your jumps seems pretty flaky as a result of the analog triggers, and this one gets annoying real quick.  Javelin Throw Infuriating. After building up your speed, you have to use the action button to throw the javelin  but there are no visual cues showing you just where you're supposed to throw it. Worst of all, the camera gives you no indication of where the throwing line is until it's too late. Rubbish.  Weightlifting Kill me now, please. I'd have an easier time hoisting 200 kilos over my head than getting perfect scores in this event, which requires insane amounts of button-mashing stamina. As expected, you mash X and B to build up the power level for the lift, then work up enough energy for the jerk. After this, you have to build stamina to lift the weight clear over your head, in a gameplay sequence programmed by Satan himself. You frantically smash X and B to get a slo-oooow moving power bar above a certain level, and if you lose the button-alternation rhythm for a half-second, the power bar flies backwards,  your weightlifter drops his weight, and you smash your Dreamcast with your fist. This is an evil, evil mini-game.  Triple Jump Build up your speed, then hit the action button at the jump line to propel yourself forward. Oddly reminiscent of the other leap-themed mini-games.    Trap Shooting Blast clays with a shotgun using the analog pad. Not worth the trouble.  Hermmm. As I read over that list, I'm not particularly blown away by any of those mini-games. It's not that they're done badly, they're just done boringly  it's akin to being escorted through a cool amusement park attraction by a terminally bored teenage host. So gameplay is merely average  but can the visual presentation make things more exciting?  Considering the twenty minutes of effort that Konami seemed to put into this graphics, I believe the response to that query is ~hell no.~ It appears that the majority of Konami's work went into the Playstation2 version, since this particular version has been whooped with the proverbial ugly stick. Though the game runs at 60fps and features cool Metal Gear Solid-style motion blur and dissolves, the character models looks like they were pulled from an N64 game. The character joints distort in a notably weird fashion, and the attempts at facial expressions are laughable  when your athlete wins an event, he gets a ~happy texture~ pasted over his face. And the crowd? Oh, sweet lord. Note to Konami: two alternating pink blob textures does not accurately represent a realistic crowd.  The character-creation mode is pretty weak (if not nonexistent)  all you can do is choose a country and assign a name. On the plus side, there seem to be different athlete texture sets for each country, so everyone doesn't look identical.   Yet the biggest sin is how Konami uses the right trigger as the universal action button. If you haven't noticed, this button is analog, and hitting it with split-second precision is not as easy as using the digital buttons on the face of the Dreamcast controller. It also requires you to hold the controller in a really uncomfortable position.   The final verdict? Blah. Despite the game's importer-friendliness (almost everything is in English), Ganbatte!'s cons far outweigh its pros, and the end result is a futile exercise in mediocrity. It's a bummer that all three of this year's Olympic-themed Dreamcast titles have fallen short of the gold  maybe we'll get a decent game in time for the next Olympic Games in 2004.  -- Colin ~Wedgie Champion~ Williamson, IGN DC", "date": "Sep 16, 2000"}
