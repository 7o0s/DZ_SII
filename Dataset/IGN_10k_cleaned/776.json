Games on two wheels are the videogame equivalent of John Tesh records -- lots of flash, a pumped-up excitement level, noise out the yanni, fast pacing, and a guaranteed fan base, but none of this is enjoyable for you, the player, and as you dully snooze through the experience you can't help but wonder why everybody keeps buying this crap long after realizing it will never again regain  the greatness of its simpler days. In Tesh's case, that's E.T.; in superbiking, it's Hang-On, the only motorbike game to really be enjoyable.   But it is EA's corporate mission to create videogames based on anything ever mentioned in the same breath as the word ~sports~ (except, of course, lacrosse, which has led many lacrosse players to think this is EA's idea of mockery -- kind of like their treatment of Dreamcast). Therefore, we have yet another sporting franchise from EA making its debut on the PlayStation: Superbiking. While Superbike World Championship and Superbike 2000 on the PC were sim games that focused on precision and details, the PlayStation counterpart (Superbike 2000) is one of those annoying arcade / sim hybrids that succeeds in neither category and pleases nobody.   Gameplay  Not sure who to aim for, the gameplay in Superbike 2000 is a bland arcade experience with far too many realistic restraints for speed freaks and far too little effective variables for purists. The sim functions of the game are fine for a console -- bikes can be chosen from six professional brands, and each cycle can be modified in front and rear forks, suspension, tire quality, and gear box ratio. Unfortunately, while all of this can be tweaked to perfection, real racing seems distant from the set-up you choose. Even when racing in the rain, the slick road hardly drags the bike out like one might expect. Bike handling is just not as realistic as necessary for such a game. The motorcycles hardly turn at all, and riders don't lean sharply enough to get an edge on the competition. That makes this game a sport of racing the proper lines, which might be fine for top sim racing game, but takes away the feel or motorbike racing. It ends up steering just like any other racer, and even worse that that in most cases.  The chief problem here is, of course, that bikes cannot crash. This affects both sim and arcade game players. For arcade gamers, the lack is obvious: crashing rocks! There's nothing sweeter than piling in a corner, spinning out of control and flipping end-over-end on a flat front tire, or sending a wheel wild into the grandstands. Without crashes, Superbike 2000 is wimpy. And for sim fans, the lack of crashing is even more injurious to the gameplay. Without crashes to put fear into the race, there's nothing stopping players from pushing the bike over its limits every turn, or even slamming corners by ricocheting off other racers. Sure, the bike takes damage, but that's noting compared to the life-and-death circumstances that face real riders when they tangle up with each other at high speeds. Even in rainy conditions, there's no reason not to slice a turn at full speed and low to the ground. Now, it's quite feasible that EA was under restraint by the SBK (who officially licensed this title) to remove crashing from the game. But, the game suffers considerably from the omission.     Graphics While the last EA motorbike game, Supercross 2000, had graphics that could only be described as butt-ugly (due to the complicated tracks and animation), Superbike 2000 looks clean and fast. Short of a solid 30 frames per second (about par for the EA course), the game still looks good in motion. Bikes are modeled accurately and sharply, riders are equally well detailed (with a few extraneous animation routines, such as a jerk rider flipping you off when contact is made), and the tracks are crisp.  Unfortunately, this is all cosmetic and not too interesting. When it comes to gameplay against graphics, neither wins. For instance, the graphic engine is so bogged down in simply running that two-player racing can only handle head-to-head -- no other riders can be on the track. Rain effects are a cheesy overlay with a darker game contrast, and the graphics in the game (roadside trees, signs, crowds) are just as sunny in a gray downpour as they are in summer weather. There are no puddles to avoid on the road. The driver's eye view is fresh (you see just over the steering wheel, and all the gauges are onscreen), but the view approximates more of a belly-button view than driver's eye, and the distortion can throw racers off their game.   Sound Again, far too simplistic for an EA game. Engine sounds are made of very small samples that loop irritatingly. You can hear the engine repeat and top out at its highest rev, and the noise is terrible. Not helping this at all is the 8-bit quality of the sound effects -- I'm not talking 8-bit sample rate, but 8-bit gaming. It's almost that bad.  And what's up with the game's commentator. A dead ringer for Monty Python's Eric Idle, (just listen to the included movies and tell me Keith Huewen is not Eric Idle!) the game suddenly gives him the rest of the day off once he's set up the race. There's swell commentary at the beginning of the race, and then it's suddenly gone. Very unprofessional compared to EA's portfolio.If you're a true motorcycle racing fanatic and you want absolute authenticity in your superbike game, Superbike 2000 on the PC is all yours -- have your jollies and leave me out of it. But even if you are that guy, the PlayStation game will not cut it. It's very sim-based but not perfectly so (the game doesn't even feature separate front and rear braking). If you're even slightly less than a true pro, there's no great reason to buy this, because there's no training mode or coach teaching you how real racers ride. Unless you're Mick Doohan, Superbike 2000 will not appeal to you. (That reference was for Mick Doohan).", "date": "Mar 14, 2000"}
