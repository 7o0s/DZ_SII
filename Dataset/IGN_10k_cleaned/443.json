Playing with the 'ole ~Sit-n-Spin.~  Riding The Beast at King's Island a good six times in a row.  The first time I saw the Teletubbies.  But regardless of how long it has been, I would have never thought the next occurrence would end up being a game.  And know that I don't mean in a ~this game is so friggin' bad it makes me sick~ sense.  Oh, no.  I mean in the ~if I don't stop playing this, I am going to literally throw up all over the place~ sort of way.  Despite all my hopes and dreams, this is the one thing I took away from Mindscape's mind-numbing Soul Fighter, but considering the alternatives present in said title, the developer should be thankful.  Oh yes, my friends.  It is that painful.  And because I love each and every one of you (well, except those of you who ask me about Dragon Ball Z), I will try my damndest to help you understand just how painful that is.  Let's start with my aforementioned Soul Fighter-induced stomach problems.  The sad truth is I used to make fun of my buddy George for the same stuff, and never thought I'd see the day that I was in the same boat with my motion-sensitive friend, but leave it to the game's hellacious camera system to throw both my figurative and literal points of view all outta whack.  I mean, this is a beat-em up game, but I never expected the cameraman to come representin' the drunken master.  It just seems like the camera never stops moving, and it swings at the most inopportune times.  You'll think you're hitting the guy in front of you until the view flips around until left is right and right is left, and the next thing you know you're running away from the bad guy.  This leads to one hell of a mess in mid-combat.  Not only is finding your intended victim near-impossible at times, but connecting with 'em once you've located them...now that can get downright nasty.  I wouldn't harp on it so much except that you simply cannot play this game without both noticing and despising this madness.  I mean, you know you have a problem when you can only tolerate a game for ten minutes at a time...that's all I'm saying.  Not only is the camera so wobbly that the game is unbearable, but the game's level design is nothing short of lifeless, and you do so much back-tracking that it becomes downright evil. Enemies will only appear after others have been vanquished, meaning that you can walk right by an area, think it is clear, then run into a world of hurt that you never saw coming thanks both to the deceptive nature of the enemy population and the wonderfully confusing camera system.  ARGH!  OK, in all fairness, in some games going back to an old spot makes sense, but with Soul Fighter, it just seems like you're running around for the hell of it, and I hate to break it to the developer, but this game isn't that pretty. I have no desire to see this much of it more than once.  The game does have its visual highpoints, however.  I'll give it that much.  Running at a fairly constant, high frame-rate, Soul Fighter can juggle several characters at once without skipping a beat.  There are a wide variety of enemies and bosses. The graphics are smooth and the animation is nothing to scoff at by any stretch of the imagination.  Perhaps if you sit on top of your washer during the spin cycle while playing, you might actually be able to ignore the camera long enough to enjoy them.  The same sort of ~close-but-not-quite~ short-comings plague the game's control scheme as well.  The combo system can be cool, weapon use is seamless and interesting at times, and the way you can attack enemies in multiple directions is something that any action developer would do well to make note of.  The problem comes in when you factor in character movement which, due to the fact that it is set on some type of  circular rotation (read: you turn like you have one foot nailed to the floor), it can be hard as hell to get your character lined up just right.  Throw in the camera problems, and you're looking at one of the more frustrating combat experiences in recent memory.  Speaking of frustration, there is one thing I simply must mention in this review.  Why in the world is this a one-player title.  Any fan of the beat-em up genre can tell you it is all about laying the smack down with a friend, complaining about who gets to pick up the chicken, and screaming bloody murder when you accidentally finish up a combo on your partner instead of the bad guys.  The game's engine could clearly handle the polys, so it's not like it wasn't possible for SF to be 2-player...it just seems like they didn't bother.  In my book, this sin goes right up there with the addition of music videos to Sifl and Olly.  Developers simply must learn that certain conventions are good for gameplay, and when you're out to copy a genre, it's best to keep in the things that make said game type enjoyable.  Two-player would be that thing to the Streets of Rage/Golden Axe clone.  What were they thinking? Ugh.  There is only so much enjoyment one can get out of a game where you do the same thing over and over.  With the exclusion of two-player action, a criminally heinous camera system and control that is nothing short of annoying, Soul Fighter has managed to earn the distinction of the worst title on the system to date in my book.  After some of the doozys I have seem this month, that is saying something.  Let's hope the next offering in the genre has a little more in the way of innovation, because this is the type of game that really helps to show the genre's age.  Disappointing.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 24, 1999"}
