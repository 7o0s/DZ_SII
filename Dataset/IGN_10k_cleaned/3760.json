Not only has the developer managed to create a bevy of brilliant and popular games, but it also has followed each of these titles up with an equally impressive expansion pack. Thankfully, Blizzard's trademark for quality doesn't seem to be slipping in the least. If The Frozen Throne expansion pack fails to satisfy fans of Warcraft III, I'd be a bit surprised.   The expansion picks up right where the original game left off. The evil bad mean nasty demon guys have been banished from the world (for the most part) and each of the races is busy creating a new home for themselves on the parts of the world that haven't been overrun with undead creatures, which really isn't a whole lot. All of Lorderon is still in their clammy clutches.   The Frozen Throne campaign starts you in the shoes of the Night Elves. Most of this natural nation is consumed with trying to bring the forests back into the loving embrace of mother nature. The demons managed to leave quite a stink that Lysol can't fix and the forest creatures are corrupted and some have turned evil. Amidst the forest cleansing sits an overzealous warden out to catch the betrayer Illidan that was let out of his prison after 10,000 years. You can imagine that he's a little pissed. Unsurprisingly, he decides it's time for a little payback. After finding a new employer, Illidan raises the Naga, a race of marine creatures, to do his bidding. So begins the struggle that will once again shake the foundation of the world.   While the story begins looking fairly black and white as usual, it quickly begins to meander from the straight and narrow as characters begin to lie, cheat, steal, and backstab everybody else. But that's really where the fun sits and Blizzard does a good a job as always telling the tale with class and style. Voice talent is once again very good, if a little over the top in some cases, and lets players get grounded in this world without a hitch.    Strategy Guide Available!

Get The Guide | Warcraft Message Boards   Through the campaigns, you'll get to see all sides as usual, with chances to play each faction as the different sides of the story are told. Through the campaigns, you'll be introduced to the new units on each side as well as some extra races that aren't quite as rounded as the existing four, but come close enough to be pretty interesting. The Naga in particular are as close as we'll get to seeing a full fledged race without having it playable in the multiplayer. They can build, have their own advantages, such as being able to swim through deep water, and have a variety of units including their own spellcasting set. Not only that, but they just look cool when they move. It's just too bad they couldn't have been balanced enough to sit in multiplayer as well. Either way, they certainly make the campaigns, which are already very good, better for their existence.   Those that prefer normal RTSs should know is that these campaigns don't usually play like traditional RTSs. Yes, there are some of the ~build base here and then conquer base there~ types of missions, but a lot of them take out resource gathering altogether and even building at some points. As was the plan for the original, the game really focuses on smaller, well put together groups. Some of the missions can probably even be thought of as dungeon crawlers akin to Diablo, only with more units and tactics involved. In the past, well frankly, I found these kind of boring. But Blizzard kept enough of the production side in these missions to retain more strategy about unit types and groups rather than forcing you to use only units found while wandering the fairly linear dungeons. There were very few missions where there was no production at all, which I'm thankful for. And what do you know? I found them enjoyable.   Outside of the main three campaigns, which follow the Frozen Throne story arc, sits the Orc campaign. This is mainly because Blizzard just didn't feel that they had anything to do with that particular struggle. It works out well, not only because things weren't forced, but because we now get a good glimpse into the future of the Orcs as they begin to rebuild their civilization, this time without the yoke of the demons dragging them down. This campaign is definitely more RPG than the rest of them, almost too much so when enemies start to respawn. Regardless, I still had some good fun with the quests and campaign in general even if it was tiresome at times.   The campaigns also actually give rise to the new units instead of the new units just being there. Most of them are explained through one occurance in the world or another, and in the Blood Elves case, are an integral part of the equation. Regardless of how closely twined to the story they are, the new units certainly change the game quite a bit for the races. The Alliance (formerly known as the Humans and those other guys) have probably been changed the most with their new anti-magic stance. The Blood Elf units that round out the playing field are very important and will definitely give those players using a lot of buff spells (you shaman addicts know what I'm talking about) pause. The Spell Breaker unit may not be incredibly powerful as a unit by itself, but when and enemy using them starts transferring your Blood Lust off of your units and onto their own, you'll suddenly realize just how much a difference they can make.   Not all of the units are so ground breakingly new and cool for their sides, but they all add more gameplay and strategies. Take the Night Elves and their new Mountain Giants for example. Not only can they take a beating, but they can also taunt units into hitting them instead of other units. This can be a major boon in the middle of a melee where you have a lot of those glass jawed archers and not much else.   Almost more interesting than the regular units are the new heroes. Each faction gets one new one, each of which is interesting in its own way. They're well designed, artistically fun, and manage to balance the game out further. But along with the new faction specific heroes are the new mercenary heroes that can fill one of your slots in the multiplayer portion of the game. Many of them have roles in the single player campaigns as well so that you can get used to them a bit and will be scattered around the various maps for those on Battle.net. Not all of these heroes seems especially useful, but many of them will appeal to players that need a little fresh air in their line-up. If you look carefully, you'll find a Pandaran running around in there as well. That April Fool's joke turned out good enough to warrant an appearance by one of them in the actual game   As if all of this wasn't enough, Blizzard also went ahead and added new tile sets (which are very pretty by the way), items, spells, and buildable shops so players can load up on items before they leave base. Add to this new sounds for all of the new units and buildings, new interface improvements, new abilities of units like the necromancer being able to raise a skeletal mage, and you've got a full load of goodies. The Frozen Throne is a good example of why Blizzard has retained its fans for so long. They don't skimp. When you think about it, most expansion packs that are released just kind of give new shoddy campaigns with less of a story and little production value. The Frozen Throne could almost stand by itself with the engaging story and gameplay. This expansion pack does exactly what it was supposed to do, it extends the life of the original game by expanding the content considerably without cutting corners in story, voice-overs, or presentation.Now if you're one of those people that didn't like what they did with the Warcraft series when they made it more centered around heroes, then you still aren't going to like this, so stay away. For my money though, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne is an excellent expansion pack. Fans of should head on out to the store and pick this one up.", "date": "Jul 2, 2003"}
