None of those that came afterwards could match the thrill, challenge, and maddening frustration of Dragon's Lair. The story was simple: Dirk the Daring must rescue Princess Daphne from the clutches of evil dragon Singe, and then there was something about some jerk named Mordroc. Throw in a few skeletons and bam! Instant classic.   Dirk, a bit of a klutz and a goof, must brave a gauntlet of traps and enemies to find and save Daphne. Two things made this adventure unique and groundbreaking. Everything was hand drawn (by Don Bluth), making it feel like you were in control of a Saturday morning cartoon, and your only control over Dirk's success or gruesome death was pressing the joystick in the right direction the moment an area onscreen flashed (or hitting the sword button). It wasn't free-roaming at all, in fact it was even more limiting than a game on rails, but it was unbelievably addictive.   Two decades later Dirk has landed on the PC and multiple consoles in a recreation of the original Dragon's Lair. But as the new title, Dragon's Lair 3D suggests, Dirk is no longer confined to prescripted movements. With full control given to players, Dirk enjoys the same hand-drawn appearance but allows for full platforming freedom. Running about in a fully realized 3D castle with all of the famous original scenes remade with incredible accuracy, Dragon's Lair 3D is a fantastic remake that will please fans of the old game despite some of its nagging problems.   While Dragon's Lair 3D shares many common elements with its predecessor, it's important to note it's absolutely its own game. Though you'll see plenty of familiar areas, villains, and puzzles, having complete control of Dirk and having fully-rendered 3D environments to explore offers a different type of gameplay experience. Don't think you're getting some rehashed Lair game -- this is the real deal. Dirk the Daring in 3D.    For a game that once simply relied on a person's joystick reflexes, Dragons' Lair 3D sure has a plethora of controls: attack, use, jump, target, block, draw sword, draw crossbow, run, crouch, and even tuck and roll. And I haven't even mentioned movement and camera control. You can even speak to Princess Daphne via an amulet, and check things out in a first-person mode.  Essentially, Lair is a puzzle game with heaps of action/platform elements thrown in. Controls should then be rather simple, a throwback perhaps to what games of the type were just a few years ago when four buttons got you through anything. But instead of focusing on a simple, intuitive interface, the developers at Dragonstone have put too much emphasis on giving Dirk a dozen possible actions, but then only ever requiring one or two. It's not bad, but it really doesn't seem to fit the game and will possibly frustrate younger players whom Dragon's Lair 3D will likely appeal to.   Your primary actions in Dragons Lair 3D are jumping and attacking. The evil wizard Mordroc's castle, made up of over 250 rooms, is filled with endless amounts of traps and beasties. The traps come in various forms and create a castle that is your classic fantasy dungeon gone into overdrive. Floors disappear, flames shoot from walls, bricks magically appear forming new walls to trap you, platforms rise and fall, bookcases move back and forth, chairs float through the air, books zip past you, explosive cannonballs crash at your feet, and pools of acid bubble and boil in anticipation of your first careless step. As Dirk you'll do tons of jumping, swinging off ropes and chains, riding moving platforms, and dying. But don't mistake for a classic platformer. Most of the falls in Lair are lethal. Not passing a room doesn't mean taking damage or losing a lot of coins (there are enemies for that). No, not passing means dying and restarting at the beginning of that room.   To keep the death varied, your platform skills will be put to a lot of different tests. There are quite a few timed puzzles where you must do one thing, for example hit a bell, and then get to the other side of the room before time runs out and hit the other bell. This is what makes up the bulk of the game. Looking at a room, dying, understanding how to beat a room, dying again, and then circumventing a room's traps with platforming elements is what Lair is all about. It's not always clear that's what you need to do though (I guess we still play expecting to be able to overcome things on skill and reflex alone), and so sometimes Dragon's Lair 3D becomes a bit too much about trial and error just to learn your objective. And it's strange that it doesn't work so well here, since trial and error was what the original Dragon's Lair was all about.       Good news is the platforming is varied enough that it doesn't get boring (though it can get frustrating). Bad news is the control scheme, camera, and collision detection. As mentioned, you will die quite a lot (don't worry, you have infinite lives) and quite a few of those instances will have nothing to do with your jumping or fighting skills -- the camera, control, and collision detection will be responsible for your undoing. Ever leapt for a chain or rope swearing you were in line to grab it, but somehow still managed to plummet to your death? Ever tried running around a corner to get stuck on a rail and beaten to death by a beastie? Ever had a camera inopportunely switch suddenly to a fixed perspective so that you would run straight off a cliff? It'll all happen.   The best way to get by it all is to play with a mouse and keyboard and turn that bleeding console camera the hell off. Even though it'll take a dexterous hand to pull off some of the run, leap, roll combos, mouse and keyboard play is by far the preferred choice. Playing out much like a third-person shooter, the camera becomes far less of a problem and the control is more stable. The less twitch, the better.  Still, as a platformer and Dragon's Lair fan, I can live with the difficulty (and boy is it difficult) and some of the frustrations resulting from the camera because this is about as intense a platform experience as you can get these days, especially on the PC, where we're always salivating at our next chance to experience a big name platformer. Obviously, anyone who's not into platform games can start edging away now.     Platforming is only half the non-puzzle oriented Dragon's Lair puzzle, with the other half being fights with numerous enemies. While there isn't the greatest variety of bad guys, there's enough to keep it from feeling like all you do is fight the same monsters each room. Fights are pretty simple, with Dirk blocking, attacking, and running away. You can lock on to enemies (useless with the mouse look in effect), but there's only two types of attacks initially, a standard swing and an overhead swing. You'll earn a few more power moves which use up mana but it's not much. How hard would it have been to add a couple of very simple single button combos to help fill out animations and give a better sense of a fluid fight? As is, the fighting gets pretty redundant rather quickly. Fortunately, you also gain a crossbow, which adds a bit more to the experience, but that doesn't save the uninvolved, flailing combat system, thrown in merely to switch up the pace.   As stated just moments ago, you need mana to perform some of Dirk's special moves. Both mana and health can be found as little blue and red orbs respectively. Fallen enemies drop them and random barrels hold them as well, meaning you've got to smash everything you see in true action-platforming fashion. Both mana and health come readily and even if you do happen to die, you'll always respawn close to where you departed. This is a good thing, because you do seriously die a lot.   To mix things up even more, Dragonstone has included a few upgrades for Dirk that can be found throughout the game. For example, Dragon's Wing gives Dirk the ability to float when he jumps and Dragon's Eye lets him see invisible objects. There are six upgrades in all and Dragonstone made a good choice in adding them into the game.   Personally, I like challenging games, and that's why I've enjoyed Dragon's Lair 3D. However, there's a difference between a challenging puzzle and one that's tough simply due to control and camera issues. While Dragon's Lair 3D certainly has some well-designed and tough quests, some of them seem difficult simply because of the camera and touchy controls. That holds Lair back a bit from being a true triumph, which is unfortunate, because after 20 years, Dragon's Lair is deserving of some new hype.       Despite its problems, it's amazing how accurate Dragon's Lair recreates some of the most well-remembered scenes of the 80's arcade era. Anyone who played the original Dragon's Lair will recognize almost every room. Remember those rolling balls in the half pipe? The robot knight and his checkerboard arena? The flying books in the library? All are redone here as if Dragonstone crammed the Dragon's Lair arcade cabinet into some mystical 3D creation machine and out came the latest version of the Lair. But the machine needs some oil.   Sure, Dragon's Lair 3D looks so much like the original arcade version, it's kind of hard to believe, but environments, while crisp and clean, can be less than exhilarating, and the somewhat stiff animation transitions (like jumping to grabbing a ledge) really hurt the intangible immersive quality the game so diligently attempts to deliver. Dirk does look as daring as ever, Daphne still has her pointy nipples and crazily risque princess outfit on, and Singe is the same fire-breathing dragon you remember from when you were seven, it's just this is not what we were all hoping for in terms of the latest in cell-shading and next-generation technology.   Most of the Dragon's Lair visual standards are here too. All of the cut-scenes were hand-drawn by Don Bluth and each area is a faithful recreation of the arcade original. Dragon's Lair 3D can easily stand beside its beautiful arcade counterpart. One thing curiously missing is the gruesome death scenes for Dirk. While a dead Dirk will still drop in front of the screen, turn to skeleton bones and crumble, the arcade version had much more gruesome detail. You'd see Dirk being eaten alive or seared with acid. None of that is here, which is unfortunate.   What did you think of Dragon's Lair 3D?  All of the classic sound effects and score from the original are back, including some new music and a few new sounds as well. The classic score gives flashbacks to days gone by, and the additional music also sounds great. But there are some oddities mixed in, like the monkey sounds the giddy goons make -- it seems out of place, despite the fact the goons are some odd mix of baboon. Probably because it's a high-pitched monkey squeal, not something you'd expect from a bigger, squatter baboon. The sound effects are good and again the score is nice, but somehow the sound field doesn't seem as full as it should be. Not quite a platformer, not quite a puzzler, Dragon's Lair attempts to take the classic appeal of the original's ~beat a room and then continue~ formula and shovel it into a game that relies heavily on platforming elements that just aren't polished enough to be perfect or even strongly competitive. As a platformer it pales in comparison to something like Rayman 2: The Great Escape, still one of our best and only efforts worth mentioning. As an action or an adventure title, it can't hope to a surmount Soul Reaver. As a daredevil, rope swinging, demon hacking, trap avoider, it doesn't best the old Prince of Persia. Still, these comparisons are somewhat frivolous, for though any one part of Dragon's Lair is uncompetitive, its whole is a memorable, nostalgic, vivid, and entertaining ride through an entirely trial and error puzzle broken into some 250 rooms. Every other element of the game is in place to further the challenge, interactivity, and believability of these puzzles, which have themselves been ripped straight from the original. See a puzzle, beat a puzzle, watch a story unfold. It's simplistic and addictive.Take it like this and enjoy it. Take it as the next Heretic II or some kind of beat 'em up meets Mario and be sorely disappointed.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
