After all, If you've ever picked up a controller, you've played around with an incarnation of the Street Fighter II series...and if you haven't, you're a liar. The game that Capcom has produced for the Game Boy Advance is, at its core, the absolute final, finished, we're-all-done-let's-move-on-to-version-number-three edition of the classic Street Fighter II series that wound down in arcades back in 1994. And it's a testament that a existing game can both work so well and not-so-well on the GBA hardware, as the system on the inside has the right stuff, but on the outside you'll be cursing Nintendo until they get it that in many games, more buttons equals better control.  Features More than 16 fighters Eight modes of play Battery save Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  The package that Capcom produced for its final return to the classic Street Fighter II series is definitely a complete one -- the team went back and recreated much better artwork for the non-fighting portions of the game, producing extremely detailed hand-painted portraits for every single one of the ~more than~ 16 combatants...giving SSFIITR a much more polished appearance. The rest of the game lifts most of the art assets from the arcade and SNES versions of the fighting series, give or take a handful of animations, all the while throwing in some really nifty graphical effects generated by the extremely capable Game Boy Advance hardware.  And then, there's the gameplay. Now, admittedly, I'm not a Street Fighter II junkie, but I am a big fan of the series regardless...and there's a reason why Street Fighter II is such a good game: absolutely tight action. And the Game Boy Advance version of the game brings the final revision of the fight engine to the table, arguably tweaked as far as the game can possibly go without encroaching on the established elements unique to the future versions of Street Fighter Alpha and Street Fighter III. Characters have enough change in control to give them their own feel, strengths and weakenesses, and even though a couple characters have lame designs, each character is liked enough by the fanbase that they all have their own niche...no one is universally shunned. And it's the series that established the familiar fighting control scheme, so Street Fighter II is a pick-up-and-play game if you've got it on a system that accurately mirrors the arcade's controls. And that's where the Game Boy Advance version falls a bit.  You can't blame Nintendo entirely for the mucked-up controls in Super Street Fighter II, even though the company was responsible for the decision of creating a new game system with only four action buttons. Capcom is also at fault by bringing their game to the system to begin with -- maybe the game shouldn't have been attempted due to the fact that the GBA just can't support the series' established six-button configuration. Whatever the case, SSFIITR suffers quite a bit due to the two fewer buttons on the system. Capcom does remedy the situation somewhat by allowing for the user to configure the controls the way they want to (which is, thankfully, saved to the cartridge by use of the battery-backed SRAM), as well as giving players the ability to change the controls on the fly to a configuration that enables gamers to pull off special moves with incredible ease. These factors do make it so the game isn't a complete loss due to the controls, but true diehards will definitely voice their distaste for the use of the shoulder buttons on the cramped GBA system.  Everything else about the game is top-notch, for Street Fighter II standards. Admittedly, we're getting a much older game than some of the better Street Fighter games available on other systems -- Capcom's definitely playing it safe in the Game Boy Advance's early years by porting existing games rather than go a little more ambitious with more advanced titles in its library. But Street Fighter II still holds up even when it's been more than a decade since the design was upgraded. The game has a ton of features, including one that encourages single player mode -- gamers collect points by defeating opponents in certain ways, and when enough points have been accumulated, special modes and characters will unlock...which is, again, saved to the battery in the cartridge (go Capcom!). It also has a two player mode through the use of the link cable...always a welcome feature, and a required one for a portable fighter. But admittedly, most players will only be able to access the single player mode, and to be honest, playing Street Fighter (or any fighter) by yourself can only go so far before you've learned all you can about the computer AI. Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival is definitely a good game for the GBA, and it's a no-brainer as a purchase if you're itching to get a little one-on-one action in on the handheld...especially if you dig the Street Fighter II series as a whole. The port went over smoothly in most all areas except controls, as the four button configuration and layout just doesn't cut it 100%. But give it time...it's not a perfect compromise for the hands, but your fingers will definitely find the zone after a few rounds.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
