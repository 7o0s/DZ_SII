I played at least two of them several years ago in my 16-bit heyday. One of them (Herzog Zwei) is still considered today as one of the greatest Genesis titles ever to grace our shores. The other, (Utopia: Creation of a Nation) was the perfect blend of Sim-City meets Space Combat this side of Asteroids. Unfortunately, the quality for such games has faded into oblivion unless perhaps, you've had yourself a nice keyboard and mouse combination on the PC.   Naturally there's been a couple of computer to console ports over the years; with StarCraft, WarCraft, and Red Alert stomping our way a generation ago. But in not a single case, did any of them recapture the fun and depth that their Windows brethren possessed. It's almost as though there's an unspoken curse for genre-hopefuls that keep them from getting the product they deserve. When will RTS fans finally get a respectable offering and end their phantom troubles?   Enter 3DO and the Army Men series. Originally conceived as a real-time competitor for computer giants like Command & Conquer and Total Annihilation, Army Men appears to have branched off into every genre but its intended one since the inception. Whether it's a helicopter actioner or a squad-level blast fest, the series has certainly evolved into a diverse collection of titles. Too bad that the lot of them range from bad to mediocre and sometimes worse. Needless to say we were quite a bit skeptical of the spanking new Army Men RTS review copy that came our way over the weekend, and sad to report rightfully so.   Don't get us wrong, the level design and concept were pretty cool. Anyone who says they don't think that playing green against tan in a backyard battlefield isn't the epitome of all things righteous, is pulling your chain. Blasting ladybugs, blowing up toy bunkers, and hiding behind rubber duckies for cover is a nice change of pace from the usual strategy fare. Not taking itself too seriously is certainly one of the game's strong points and lends a refreshing look at the archetypal strategy set. Oh, and if any of you out there have ever seen the Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece Apocalypse Now then you'd certainly appreciate the madman behind it all back-story (Think Kurtz with a melted toy head and you'll get the idea).   But concept isn't what makes an RTS game enjoyable; if it were then there would be literally hundreds of titles on PC worth picking up in that genre alone. In the real world, gameplay is what separates the dung from the beetle, and that my friends is what Army Men is seriously lacking.   Selecting your units is surprisingly easy to accomplish; with a quick button press, a sphere surrounds the soldiers that you want to command and grows with each additional click. From here, you can then tell your guys where you want them to go, what you want them to attack, or just have them stand there like a bunch of plastic statues. I was glad to see that the simplified interface wasn't clunky or awkward, and I felt confident that perhaps for the first time in awhile we had ourselves a console RTS worthy of our precious succulent time. My confidence quickly faded.   The main reason being of course, the complete lack of balance or strategy involved in winning a particular mission. Made up primarily of ~move from point A to point B~ type objectives, you can literally run to the finish line in the early missions without worrying about tactics at all. Later on when the situation becomes heavier, the premise shifts to ~who has the most units~ and a war of attrition begins. If you have 50 dudes and they have 15 chances are you're going to win. If they have more guys, we might as well stick a fork in you.   The strange thing is, if there is a slight difference in numbers (say your 30 to their 20) the computer has an automatic advantage and will annihilate your commandos in orderly fashion. Apparently an attempt to make the action more exciting, the tan side is obviously stronger with two of their warriors equal to three of yours. Make sure you stack up on the infantry because unless you do, you're in for hours of frustrating swearing sessions. A Russian-style blitzkrieg is the way to go.   Bulldozers, Dump Trucks, flamethrowers, bazooka men, and all sorts of not-so regular units are yours to command, but other than a firepower issue it doesn't really make much of a difference. A crowd of bazookas and three times as many machine gunners are all you need to accomplish nearly every mission. Play testing apparently was not a priority here.   Which is what makes us wonder why this Army Men installment is even considered a strategy title. Basically a standoff between two opposing forces, a defensive and offensive plan of attack is pretty much a moot point. Stand in front of each other and fire until one of you is dead, and on to the next mission to do it again. Whoopee!   There are a couple of extra PS2 features we could mention, like the exclusive levels the PC version doesn't have, an information database, and the well-polished graphics, but after spending an entire weekend disappointed why bother? Is playing a strategy game devoid of strategy even worth it? A one-time rental for die-hard fans only, Army Men RTS is the classic example of a superlative package with nothing inside.From the bad rep the Army Men series was getting on the Nintendo 64 and PC, I was a little reserved in playing the Game Boy Color game. But I was pleasantly surprised -- the portable game is a heck of a lot of fun to play. It's not entirely difficult since you can get hit plenty of times by gunfire and find a health pack nearby almost like clockwork -- but after two hours of straight play I only managed to get through half the available missions. I also wish there were more opportunities to drive the vehicles in the game -- I only found two jeeps in the first 12 missions. If 3DO is continuing the series on the Game Boy Color, we've got two suggestions: two-player link cable support, and more variety in the missions. Otherwise, it's a fine Game Boy Color product and worth picking up.", "date": "Apr 1, 2002"}
