The fact that EA Canada is behind EA Sports' marvelous NHL 2002 is satisfying because nothing smacks of hockey like the word ~Canada~, eh? Rather than being salty and upset the United States has stolen several of their teams and usurped the spirit of their national sport, the folks at EA Canada has simply delivered the best hockey simulation anywhere on any platform with NHL 2002 on Xbox. When you ignore Midway's NHL Hitz because of its arcade leanings, you realize there's no hockey sim competition for EA's game. So they didn't have to make the game good, but they did because of an obvious love of the game.   The Features    Six gameplay modes including; ~Play Now,~ Season, Career, Playoff, Shootout, and Tournament Official NHL and NHLPA licensed product including all 30 NHL and 20 International teams  Commentary by new announcer Don Taylor joins play-by-play call of Jim Hughson  Create-a-player feature Emotion Meter allows you to keep the crowd in a frenzy with big hits, goals and brilliant play  NHL Cards will give players even more incentive to keep playing NHL 2002.  All New GameStory feature will track and present in-depth game information and trends All New Breakaway Cam will seamlessly shift the action to a real-time first person perspective during breakaway attempts  The music and likenesses of Toronto-based musical artists Barenaked Ladies will be featured throughout NHL 2002   Gameplay Where do I start? The sense of speed and fluidity is as important to a hockey game as the ice or the skates. It's a defining characteristic of the sport and it's easy to duplicate in a videogame. Even with all of the adjustable settings and difficulty levels, the flow of NHL 2002 stays consistent. The animation of the players, so you can see what the heck is going on goes hand in hand with the speed of the game. You want to be able to appreciate Jaromir Jagr's strength, agility and grace when you slash through the defense and NHL 2002 allows you to do just that with amazing articulation and authentic moves. All of that motion capture technology has finally paid off because we're playing EA's games on systems that can faithfully reproduce the moves.   The level of hockey accuracy in NHL 2002 is so detailed that you can learn how the sport is supposed to be played in real life. It's a combination of the animation and outstanding physics that will make you appreciate this game and professional hockey players. If you make a pass to a streaking center for a one timer and you don't put it on his strong hand, your center will spin around to put the puck in his wheel house before letting loose with a slap shot. This ruins your chance for a one timer, but it's what would happen in real life NHL action and you should've known better than to make such a sloppy pass. This is one example, but there are plenty more times where I had to hit the replay button to make sure I saw and understood what I thought I saw while playing this game.   We know NHL 2002 plays an outstanding game of hockey but they went nine steps further by including plenty of depth to keep us playing. The NHL cards, a brilliant ripoff of the feature first introduced in Madden football, are nice rewards for playing well and playing often. Unlocking new post-goal celebrations with NHL cards is a stroke of genius and enough motivation in and of itself to keep playing. Can't wait until we can unlock celebrations in other sports games like football and baseball.   They call it a TV style presentation but the use of camera angles and replays in NHL 2002 doesn't look like any telecast I've ever seen. Sure we all expect to get nice replays when we score but in this hockey game they'll break into the live action with a sophisticated three part replay whenever you land a big check or your goalkeeper makes an outstanding save. The puck is still live but the developers did an amazing job of timing the replays so that you won't feel like you're missing anything or being put at a disadvantage. Not only that, but the all-new breakaway cam is an innovation that you knew you always wanted but didn't think was possible. If you get your guy with the puck outside the blue line charging towards the keeper with no defenders around, you'll switch to a nearly first person, ice-level, slo-mo perspective where you're still in control of the player. It's still up to you to take the shot, but you'll be able to see an opening in the goalie's setup a lot easier. It's as awesome as Max Payne's Bullet Time feature, but well within the rules of hockey. You'll finally be able to see what Pavel Bure sees when he breaks free of the defense.   The comprehensive season mode comes with all of the stats, info and roster management you can handle. Teams will propose trades to you throughout the season which is something that's been lacking in many of EA's other sports titles over the years. Most of the CPU's trade offers are as lame as the ones you try to pull off yourself, but that's the charming part of it. Random hot, cold and fatigue streaks all shape the flavor and strength of your team from game to game. All of this stuff is top notch. When you want a little international flavor the different national teams offer up some realism that shouldn't be missed. A game between the Czech Republic and Slovakia or Russia and Ukraine will not only have all kinds of national pride at stake, but they'll play with the style those nations are known for. Hook up a game against Team Canada and you'll get a clinic in beautiful offense with all of that precision passing they do. It's partly due to the talented players but there's obviously a system at work with the best team in the game. I think EA Canada made the Canadian squad the best team in the game as a way to get even with all of us unappreciative yankees, but that's neither here nor there.  You know the multiplayer mode is going to rock the house without me even mentioning it. But it does in fact kick ass all over the place.  Graphics The nuts and bolts of NHL 2002 are so complete that it's easy to overlook the gorgeous graphics and outstanding audio. Cuts in the ice, animated crowds and rink ice that reflects players and shadows without so much as a flutter make the live action hockey look better than the replays most of the time....and the replays aren't that bad. Name another game where this is true.   The animation is so detailed and precise that you will notice things like a guy switching his body around to get the puck on his strong hand but there's more than that. Big shooters will have a bigger wind up on their slap shots. Small, agile puck handlers will always keep the pill closer to themselves. And goalies make full use of their blockers, pads and sticks because they should and because NHL 2002 allows you to see them do it. Plus it's a great way to pump up your Emotion Meter. The first few rows of the crowd are polygonal and they'll wear team jerseys and crazy hats while they're jumping up and down, booing and cheering the two teams. Hockey should be the first sport to feature polygonal crowds because of the relatively small arenas.  The jerseys and players could've had a little more detail because even in the letterboxed replays the textures are a little bland and flat. EA Canada went for more activity in their replays and the game itself rather than great textures on the players. You do leave cuts in the ice that only get worse the longer the game goes, but with the default camera setting (the same great top down perspective we've seen since the Genesis days) you'll hardly notice.   Sound To the untrained ear, the commentary in NHL 2002 may seem silly and below average, but if you're a sports videogaming junkie, it's a welcome breath of fresh air. The attempts at comedy may flop from time to time, but the fact that Jim Hughson and Don Taylor are constantly interacting and trying to evoke a certain mood is what counts. They'll both chime in on a play that was just made and get specific down to the kind of shot you took and where the goalie was beat. They'll refer to general trends in the game by saying things like ~Anaheim didn't take enough shots in that period to get back in this game~ when you're outshot by a wide margin.   The best part is when a guy reaches a milestone during a game in season mode. 600th career assists, 200th goals all get a nod from the fellas and you'll love it. The more of this we see in sports games the better.  The Barenaked Ladies, a Toronto-based band getting all kinds of promotion from EA in this game, provide the soundtrack for NHL 2002. While I'm a big fan of their namesake, I can't get too excited by countless tracks by the Ladies since they tend to run together in my mind. But they love their hockey so who am I to get in the way? It could've been worse. EA could've dug up Loverboy, Snow or some other Canadian act  nobody wants to hear from again when they went to package this game.   All of the sound effects are top notch. From the pinging of a puck hitting the post, to the lulls and crescendos of the crowd, to the slicing shooshing sound of 10 guys on skates, NHL 2002 has what it needs.  I think it's significant that NHL 2002 even as an enhanced port of the original on PS2 is good enough to scare off all potential competitors. For some reason, anybody can throw together a football game and roll it out there and expect to make money (as we've seen) but hockey tends to separate the men from the boys. Even though it's a sport --along with soccer-- better suited for videogames because of its fast paced nonstop action, hockey gets kept in the back because of the NHL's second class status in the American sports scene. In any case, NHL 2002 is an excellent sports game. It's more satisfying to hockey fans than Madden is to football fans because the essence of the sport shines through all of the glamour and polish. Not that there's anything wrong with the extra stuff EA loaded into this game, but one of the truisms of videogames is that when all of the fancy stuff is said and done, there's nothing but you the player and the gameplay. NHL 2002 is fast fun and highly recommended to all sports fans, not just hockey fans. Casual sports fans and non sports gamers may not be able to appreciate the depth and intricacies of hockey so NHL Hitz 2002 is definitely an option for these folks. But if you know your Habs from your five-holes, and don't flip to TNT's 9000th airing of The Witches of Eastwick when SportsCenter runs its NHL highlights, then  NHL 2002 is for you.The only nit to pick is that you can't load info from your memory unit, only the hard drive. Having to copy your saved game from the MU to the hard drive is an unnecessary extra step.", "date": "Dec 12, 2001"}
