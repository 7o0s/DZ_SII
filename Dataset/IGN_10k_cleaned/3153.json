Between the months of September and January we are, on a professional whole, bombarded with too many titles too quickly. The resulting mayhem and editorial stress works to our detriment and your betterment. In this hectic season, review assignments come on a daily basis (they're taped to the Tylenol, which is conveniently left in chilled bottles of Jack for maximum effect).   During this time, we need to pick and choose what we play wisely. Which game do you want, Dan? Ivan? Steve? More foolish editors (Dan) avoid golf titles like the plague or Tal after a sink-free trip to the bathroom. Fools! I happily volunteer for a little clubbing under the hot Hawaiian sun whenever the opportunity presents itself. It's because of this selfless sacrifice for the good of the team -- a secret indulgence -- that I'm allowed to consistently experience what's quickly becoming one of my most cherished sports subgenres.    There's nothing quite like awaking in a car after a long and rejuvenating freeway nap upon completing a hearty but arduous fourteen hour day of work to saunter into the front door of a welcoming home and turn on a little interactive golf. It bores the children into a rare silence, stymies the wife's futile attempts at intimacy, and soothes the souls of weary players until the frustration from losing yet another hole to an amateur sets in and the keyboard accidentally gets shattered against the monitor with surprisingly flammable results.   But which golf game to play and become infuriated by? We have Links. We have Tiger. For a hardcore geek, the decision is tougher than picking between that regretless one night stand with a somewhat acceptably attractive neighbor and cuddling up with a bowl of Dryer's Peanut Butter Ice Cream in front of always alluring episodes of Star Trek. In the end, both are valid choices capable of pleasing and effortlessly finding happy homes in the hearts of avid players, but the young Millionaire with the oversized smile manages to barely edge out his competition this year with a slicker presentation and a more robust, tantalizing offering. Even if he fails to perfect all he attempts, and indeed falters when it comes to standing head-to-head with the Microsoft funded giant in some departments, Tiger does offer that appreciable extra amount of spice to make a purchase super nice. Again, Links is still great, clean fun regardless.  Golf is considerably different than other sports. It doesn't have the high impact thrills of football, nor does it feature the competitive back-and-forth mechanics of basketball. It is a one-man show, a game defined by skill, strategy and patience, and as such it's also a sporting genre that has always made the transition to videogames very well. Over the years there have been countless golf titles -- some flawed, some good and some great, but few that could be called the true Madden of golf with any validity. Leave it to developer Headgate Studios, though, to change that.     From Sierra's PGA Championship series, to last year's Tiger, to this, Headgate helped pioneer the art of the analog swing and 3D golf game, and now the company is showing what experience, patience, and the funding of the largest third-party publisher in the world can do for you.   Over the years, True Swing has been all but perfected. Naturally, classic 3-click and other swing types are still around, but pulling back and following through with the grace of a real golfer is only possible with a solid mouse and the now standard analog control setup. In this respect, a lot of the differences from last year come in the form of physics and animation. The retooled engine allows for some startlingly smooth swings, always responsive and fluid. Violent lunatics will still find ways to jerk up the golfers (it's not that hard to do), but decent computers and serious players will rarely find a hiccup.   Getting the ball off the ground was always a bit of a problem for the last version. The inconsistent motion and steep requirements prohibited most players from truly enjoying the then relatively new ~mouse~ play. Such is not the case here. One of the main priorities throughout the development of Tiger 2003 has been to keep the requirements low and the game scalable. This approach ultimately benefits the title and its players. The lower settings, tweaked engine, and refinements make for a far more stable, enjoyable experience.  Ball physics are not quite up to Links' polished levels, but seem to have made a drastic leap forward over last year's odd bounces, sometimes tar-like grass, and brick trees. The tops of elms and maples are not impassable barriers, and most swings, especially those more complex ones unraveled with deeper play, are fairly accurate. There are a few collision detection issues (thudding to a jarring and inexplicable halt when hitting a trunk in full flight), and a few troublesome quirks, like the intentionally slowed down and hampered movement of the putt, but it's otherwise stellar, and an easy usurper of Microsoft's crown.   But what are physics and play without modes? Even though this game has a potentially awesome, but somewhat suspicious and dubious multiplayer component, it does come with plenty of modes and options, but a first revision plagued career, however cool, isn't perfect.   EASO. After the initial free trial runs dry, playing online will cost 5$ a month. But, that subscription carries over to other EA Sports titles and you get the first few months of love free of charge. It's a solid deal, seeing as how one profile can be created, managed, and tracked with all games. As whole, this latest rev of EASO (the first one of substance), still has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out, but it's an awesome feature nonetheless. It's not nearly as stable as Links' instant email tourneys, but good nonetheless.  19 Game Types, 12 Courses, 15 PGA Tour pros, ball types, club types, and rudimentary character creation develop things nicely.           RPG elements come into play during the career mode where gamers start as rookies and then buy their way to glory by completing events as they arise in a basic calendar. Play in challenges (a lot of which are somewhat dry) and all the while learn and earn more advanced shot techniques. The career mode is a solid addition to seasonal play, but isn't as involving from front to back as it could have been. First, character creation (which doesn't just apply here) is sorely limited, especially when compared to other sports games where things like weight, height, and so forth are taken into consideration. Then comes the steadily progressing, static calendar. The challenges it drops differ, but don't come with nearly enough variation and special game modifiers to hold interest as setting up several seasons would. What the team has planned for the future (weather and such that play upon the game's ability to attain data from actual locations and represent it in the game) is impressive, but not yet here.    But where are the extra additions? Just because ours is the version that is more simulation, doesn't mean it has to completely omit the extra goodies like the Scotsman in the kilt, or the fantasy courses. More mini-games and the ability to relive golf's greatest moments by replaying them in-game would have been awesome.   Last year was luscious, this year is stunningly luscious. Ample self-shadowing, even more impressive character models, excessive use of preset idle motions, still immensely detailed environments, sharp textures, and infinitely improved animations are big, big bonuses. On top of all this, the game surpasses Links in two major areas.   1) Up close detail.  2) Liveliness.  Getting up close and personal with balls, shoes, and grass is no longer an unwelcome eyesore, but rather a pleasure. Clubs are meticulously detailed, shiny and solid. Balls are rendered with each and every groove and visible logos. The soles of shoes have even been remarkably cared for. To top it all off, clothing loosely sways and drapes off players as if it were an entity separate from the body itself. Rain, moving clouds, wonderful shadowing, and more top it all off. Animals still aren't plentiful, and it'll never get cloudy, then sunny, then rainy, then dark, but the trees sway and the gallery claps, albeit poorly.  But, what pulls it all together and propels the game light years ahead of the competition aesthetically is how everything moves. The motion of the ocean is intoxicating. The cinematic, TV style camera and presentation really add a new dimension of flare and immersion to the genre. Arcing cameras that can always be controlled with the push and hold of a button follow the action, snap to, pan around, tilt over, and follow everything with precise detail. Because of the uncanny amount of detail put into each and every object, Tiger also isn't afraid of using powerful and absurdly zoomed in camera angles that would make other games shudder in disgust.   What did you think of Tiger 2003?  The aural component is far more hit and miss. Commentators and play-by-play are cool buzzwords, but often times more ruin an audio component than help it. Such is the case here. David Feherty and Bill Macatee turn what is otherwise great atmosphere and environmental noise into aggravating, stuttering, sometimes nonsensical, inane, or just plain there and bothersome audio. It's a shame since all of the game aside from this and the extremely inappropriate heavy rock and roll music that plays in the intro (it's as if at any moment Tiger would turn around and scream, shattering the golf ball with his vocals like Paul Atreides would have a man's chest in Dune), are pretty good.  This is where I normally try to condense the entire article into one or two paragraphs and close with something witty. Instead, I'll leave you with this bit of profound wisdom...Tiger Woods 2003 reminds me of nuts in a sack. It's that good. And, just like nuts in a sack, you should have it or at the very least know someone who does so that you can use theirs.", "date": "Nov 6, 2002"}
