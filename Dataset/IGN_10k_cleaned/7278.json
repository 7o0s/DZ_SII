Though Guilty Gear X2 #Reload and this compilation's brawling namesake are too old or too limited to stand on their own, when taken together they provide rather satisfying bangs for their buck... even if they do feel a little too familiar.   To be honest, using the term ~familiar~ when describing a Guilty Gear game feels weird since the series has never really benefited from the same play as other ongoing franchises like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. Despite its lack of popularity, though, the gameplay in Gears has usually been exceptional -- boasting blindingly-quick combos and a weapons-heavy emphasis aimed at fans of anime art styles and old-fashioned butt rock. Hell, some of Guilty Gear's characters are even named after famous bands or front men (Eddie, Axl, Dizzy, Slayer, and Testament to call out a few). Inspirations aside, this is definitely a pretty good series to get into if given the chance despite the fact that Isuka, the franchise's last effort, left most of us disappointed.    Speaking of Isuka, the idea of that title's side-scrolling mini-game has been poached and expanded on with this set's Judgment portion. Reminiscent of classic side-scrolling fighters like Knights of the Round, Double Dragon or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guilty Gear Judgment is a traditional brawler dressed in unworn clothing. The best news is that, in contrast to its PSP counterparts of similar origin, Judgment isn't an old coin-op ROM; it's a brand new project that hasn't been seen before.   What we get here isn't on the light side either. In fact, the beat 'em up segment is pretty lengthy compared to most titles in its category and more than 20 different characters can be used to hack through the action (five initial fighters, 15 unlockable ones, and one super secret combatant can be found to be exact). The stages aren't very short, the boss battles can be tough, and you'll learn a few little tidbits about the characters that you may not have known before along the way (expect several personalized conversations too). Of particular note are the crisp 2D graphics. They're fantastically drawn and have great animations to boot. As an added bonus, players can enjoy these visuals in two different modes (Story and Survival) or hook up with an ad hoc buddy and enjoy some co-op baddie thrashing.    As strong as Judgment's mechanics are (thanks to Arc System's decision to use a fighting game's move-set while simultaneously eliminating the god awful turn-around button from Isuka), this title still falls prey to a number of hitches that limit its fun -- specifically with its high repetition. You see, extensive as the story mode may be, its selection of enemies is extremely limited and regardless of who you use to get to the end, it's still essentially the same experience over and over again. The rewards don't necessarily merit the journey either, as there aren't any big story revelations and some boss fights can get particularly frustrating thanks to cheap moves and irritating loads.   Despite the fact that the title of this package takes its namesake from the beat 'em up segment of the equation, Judgment's best feature is still its fighting game half. Based on the Guilty Gear X2 #Reload console and arcade releases, this fighter is a fully-featured high-combat experience. All the same combos, Psych Bursts and Roman Cancels have made their journey from bigger screen to smaller with good results, and the speedy, ~take no prisoners~ Guilty Gear gameplay translates well to the PSP... even if the onscreen moves don't always cooperate with what you do on the D-pad (if you have one of those Tekken directional add-ons, use it).   Granted, there is a little pixilation with the visuals and some of the modes available in other versions of #Reload didn't make the transition (bye-bye online play and tricky missions), but Guilty Gear X2 still stands as one of the best fighters of the last five years and getting it in portable form for our PSPs isn't a bad thing. Besides, PSP players do get the benefit of ad hoc competition even if Infrastructure and Game Sharing options were left out (along with the Guilty Gear Slash upgrade that Japanese users got with the package, but that's another story).Though limited and repetitive, Guilty Gear Judgment's side-scrolling story mode isn't a bad way to pass the time for an hour or two before moving on to the real reason you paid admission, Guilty Gear X2 #Reload. While somewhat stripped down compared to its console equivalent, it still offers one of the best fighting engines on PSP and its occasional directional pad woes are the fault of the system's design, not the game's. The only major disappointment here is that we've played Reload before in other incarnations with more options, leaving diehard fans of the series (who are, let's face it, the main target audience) with little incentive to pick it up again. Still, it's fun stuff if they do.", "date": "Sep 23, 2006"}
