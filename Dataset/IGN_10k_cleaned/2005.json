One feels bad knocking its faults, but vaguely guilty going the other way and praising it.  It's not a bad game exactly, but so curiously limited in its ambitions for this day and age that a recommendation seems like just a little bit more than it deserves.    If you remember reading something like this before, it was probably the notice for World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks, a game with which War Jetz shares far more than a nascent brand.  This is, essentially, Thunder Tanks with planes, adding a third dimension to the original model of arcade-style destroy-everything tank combat.  That extra dimension is something new, but we'd be surprised if you didn't feel more than a little dj vu here regardless.  You fly around the arena; you blow everything up; you collect weapon power-ups; etc.  It's fun for a while, but the appeal wears, and the lack of four-player deathmatch removes what was one of the first WDL game's greatest assets.   Gameplay  War Jetz isn't a flight sim, even in the unbelievably loose Air Force Delta sense of the term.  It controls a little like Rogue Squadron, for lack of a better comparison, combining a fixed behind-the-back perspective with simple control and a few handy canned maneuvers for evasion and negotiating tight spaces.  Like I say, envision Thunder Tanks with altitude control and consistent forward velocity.  You won't be very far off.  These controls work quite well for the game they've been designed to suit -- it's deeper where the problems start.  War Jetz tosses you into a variety of arenas alone, with one of a handful of different mission objectives to complete.  Most of them fall into a few basic categories: capture the flag, collect ~Bux~ (money), or search-and-destroy, where you're given a particular target or targets to kill.  The latter are the most fun, because sometimes the objectives are genuinely original.  For example, in the San Francisco region, there's a mission where you have to kill all the BART trains as they cruise in and out of tunnels -- great fun for a veteran commuter like me.  But CTF and grab-the-Bux inspired a sinking feeling every time they came up after the first territory.  Collecting money in particular is deadly dull, especially when the enemy planes you're theoretically competing against win the level for no reason you can immediately discern.  Is the actual combat entertaining?  The variety of aircraft is interesting, particularly since you can bring in two planes to a battle and swap between them with a certain pickup.  But while their characteristics vary, the ends to which you direct them are not.  There are ground targets to destroy and enemy planes to bring down -- lather, rinse, repeat.  Health power-ups abound in case you take much ground fire, and the targets that aren't stationary may as well be.  Enemy aircraft go down with hardly a fight, especially if you're in a plane with a good air-to-air special weapon.  The A-10's Vampire Ray is hilariously powerful, for example, since it fills your life while killing an enemy with a solid two-second burst.  The special-weapon recharge rate needs to be much slower than it is.  Long and the short of it is, while killing stuff is a hoot for a territory or two, there needs to either be more stuff to do here or a higher learning curve for what little there is to do.  The two-player mode is a disappointment simply because of the fact that it's only two players -- Thunder Tanks wouldn't have been much fun as a multiplayer game without its four-player split-screen.  It's an unfortunate loss, presumably due to technical constraints.  Graphics  Visually, War Jetz is held back more than anything by its resolution.  Perhaps the closest analogy would be a 60fps Nintendo 64 game -- it moves as smooth as you'd wish, but the textures everywhere are dull and muddy.  The postapocalyptic future is very brown, green, gray, with a few ruddy tones the one infrequent attempt to brighten things up a bit.  The explosions throw in some nice oranges, but their jagged resolution is jarring, and they're over with quickly.    Special effects for things like contrails and lighting work a little better, but the overall appearance of the game is still rather garish -- compared to the finely-tuned atmosphere of Twisted Metal: Black or the icy purity of Ace Combat 4, this doesn't measure up in either the air combat or the pointless-vehicular-violence arenas.    Sound  Sound?  I could hardly notice it most times.  War Jetz has very bland musical accompaniment most times, when it has any at all, and the sound effects bleed together into a continuous dull roar of explosions.  The in-game commentary is seemingly limited to just a few phrases for the two announcers (Kate Maxwell, and Jimmy ~Hellcats~ Jackson), and the endless repetition should send you to the options menu sooner rather than later -- thanks to 3DO for letting me turn it off, at least.  One aspect of the voice acting that does deserve some respect involves the FMV cutscenes, though.  The announce team, respectively, are the chick with huge breasts and no personality, and the demented veteran pilot OD'd on Benzedrine.  Guess which one's more entertaining.  Jimmy is, I kid you not, VERY funny now and again, giving the impression that there was somebody on the dev team who liked to practice his stand-up act while he waited for the new builds to burn.  Watch for the 78RPM rant about the girls at the Blue Moon and see if you can make any more sense of it than I did. So give Jimmy Jackson his own game and we'll see what happens.  He is, sad to say, not quite entertaining enough to carry this one.War Jetz isn't harmed by failed execution so much as limited ambitions.  It's a game where you fly about and shoot things, but its particular way of presenting that classic design has neither the gripping realism of a sim or the nostalgic purity of a classic shooter.  The variety of craft and mission types helps a little, but you still wind up repeating yourself far too many times before the game is over.I'm serious about the Hellcats Jackson game, though...", "date": "Jul 3, 2001"}
