When I used to work for Next Generation magazine, we would drink beer at a place called Knuckles across the street from the office in Burlingame. We would drink and play, and some people got worse, while others got better. My skill improved with beer, and I could beat anybody. A few years later, I bet Tom Russo, the EIC at Next Gen then, shots of Jaegermeister who could win. I spanked him, and it got ugly (he denied it, wanted a rematch, etc.). I smiled and drank some more. It was good. Ah yes, those glorious Pac-Man days, they touched us all. Before I was allowed to drink beer, Namco's original arcade game started a weird craze back in the early 1980s. In the effort to re-awaken the public's mind to the spirit of Pac-Man, last year Namco brought out Pac-Man World 20th Anniversary, a happy little platformer that was so cute and likeable it was hard to ignore. Well, I managed to ignore it, but Namco has created a sequel for PS2, and it's here, ready for Pac-Man fans to have at it. Pac-Man World 2 is just as cute and adorable as the first, and it's remarkably solid in all of the important areas -- the platform-style gameplay manages to incorporate elements from Mario, Klonoa, Sonic, and just about every other platform game ever made. The graphics are basic and cute. The sound remains chirpy and so simplistic that there aren't more than four bars per song. The game appears harmless and wonderful, and for the most part it is, except it's harder and crueler than it appears, and the camera work is pathetic. That's the game 's biggest weakness, though there are a few others. What's amazing to me is how a game that's obviously borrowed every platform trick in the book didn't also manage to steal someone else's good camera work, too. Pac-Man World 2 is surprising that way.  GameplayWith dozens of worlds that feature every  clichd level in the book, it's amazing that my cynicism meter didn't immediately ring like the Liberty Bell when I first played this title. But that's like saying that Kermit the Frog is a sell-out. He's a fuzzy, goofy frog. He's innocent and sweet and funny. He's genuine. The charm of this game is that it stars a smiling golden sphere with arms and legs. The star character is Mr. Pac-Man, a yellow volleyball painted with a panting tongue. He's irresistible. I had a blast playing this game because it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a simple, 3D platform game starring Pac-Man. Oddly enough the oldest platform character in videogame history is a breath of fresh air. The story that propels Pac-Man into his adventure is silly and irrelevant, but it's worth knowing somehow. In the middle of Pac-Village grows an ancient tree with golden fruit. As long as nobody touches the fruit, Pac-Land will remain happy and carefree. But late one night a troupe of ghosts sneak into the village and steal the fruit. Abruptly, the tree shakes, the earth moves, lightning strikes, and the universe for a moment may crumble into nothingness. From the darkness, Spooky the ghost laughs his evil laugh. He's been freed! He orders the ghosts to hide every last one of the fruits from the Pac-People, rendering them helpless...unless, of course, you save them. Ah yes, it all rests on your shoulders to save Pac-Land! Thus, you embark on the journey of a lifetime. Players are treated to seven major worlds, each with a handful of levels inside them, and they range from Pac-Village, Forest, Tree Tops, Snow Mountain, Lava, Ocean, and Ghost Island. While nearly every single one has been in every single platform game ever made, they remain serendipitously enjoyable. Actually, I can't remember any platform games that had a Tree Top level like this, and I would say that this level is one of the better ones in the game. It brings the Sonic Adventure and Klonoa jumping aspects into play, but it's done in a lush green forest high in the air. The ice-skating levels and Snow levels are also particularly enjoyable, with well-balanced timing aspects worked in and solid ~platform physics~ to boot.Pac-Man has all sorts of abilities, and I'm quite surprised and pleased to know he's so versatile. In addition to the standard walking, running, jumping, and head-bonking stuff, Pac-Man can swim above and under water, he's capable of a spin-dash a la Sonic the Hedgehog, and he hangs on the edges of objects, able to shimmy like Lara Croft. In short, there's pretty much nothing he can't do, that little guy. New to this Pac-Man World 2 are the abilities to ice skate, inline skate, swim with flippers, and swim and fire a weapon in a submarine level. Oh, and when he finds metallic balls sitting around? Well, he grabs them and becomes heavy, sinking to the bottom of lakes and picking up the items down there, becoming invulnerable to heat, flames, and baddies, too. He also shrinks and enters into miniature crevices, too. Super Mario 64, anyone? Needless to say, the levels put his abilities to the test. Pac-Man must fight all sorts of bosses, jump on trampolines high above the forest treetops, swim through rivers, and man, does he jump a lot. All the while he is collecting dots, fruit, and tokens for various reason. This game has more jumping than any platform game in recent memory, which is not a bad thing, if only the camera were a little more flexible. It is also filled with neat little tricks and gameplay gems. One little trick that Namco pulls off is the flying Pac-Man thing. Upon revealing a big red ball, Pac-Man eats it and via a cut-scene he flies through the air eating a corkscrew line of dots, landing him in another, usually useful, location. It's cute and fun. Surely the very best aspect of the game is the way in which the old-school Pac-Man games are weaved into the gameplay. When players find little special items or they enter into special locations, Pac-Man enters into the maze games. Players then start playing a 3D isometric Pac-Man game in the same style as the original arcade game. Of course, it's 3D and it's not quite the same, if truth be told. The controls are a tad less responsive and the course design isn't as ~fresh~ as it once was. But it's still fun to go from platform gaming to old-school Pac-Man, regardless. Also, by collecting enough tokens, players can return to pac-Village and play a handful of old-school Pac-Man games, including the original Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Attack, and Pac-Mania. These games can be found in the arcade in Pac-Village, and each retains a little sentence or two, providing historic setting, al of which is nicely incorporated into the game. With all of this fun to be had, the other side of the story isn't quite as pretty, and Pac-Man World 2 does have its fair share of problems. The first and most prominent is the camera system, which apparently dates back to 1274 B.C. One of the most prominent principles to follow in a videogame is to reward the gamer for learning the skills the game has to offer, and not to punish him or her for playing well. The game shouldn't punish the gamer for performing well.  In Pac-Man World 2 the camera acts in some cases as the player's worst enemy. It sticks against objects in the world, it collides with objects and locks up, it actually moves while the Pac-Man is in mid-jump, and in general, it is simplistic, tedious, primitive, and sometimes non-functional. In some cases, the camera won't show you where you're supposed to jump. In others, it switches into automatic mode during some of the most crucial times that it should actually permit the player to manually move the camera. Often times players can't see because the camera is hidden behind leaves trees or some other object. For all of the great things that are going on in Pac-Man World 2, the camera is ridiculously behind the rest of the game's techniques and achievements. There are other concerns, aside from the camera. The underwater submarine level requires that players avoid some objects, shoot others, and with a targeting system that only appears at the last second, the game challenges you to death far too often and cheaply. It goes on forever, without checkpoints and then at the end it offers a checkpoint. There is no logic behind this, since the checkpoint IS the end of the level. This level comes in well below the skill and balance that went into the TreeTop level. And another thing, I love a challenge. I was surprised at how challenging this game is. To pass a level is generally easy, but to collect everything? That takes some skill, and I don't think that little seven-year-old Johnny is going to be doing that anytime soon. Heck, collecting everything in this game is a surprisingly daunting task. In the end, while the game is fresh and fun about 75% of the time, the other 25% of the time may be the time you remember most, and not fondly. GraphicsPac-Man World 2 is a lovely little title with graphics that are based in the old school theory of visuals -- the more simplistic the better. Every object is based on the concept of basic building shapes, mostly circles and spheres, sometimes squares, cones and rectangles, but only when things get really fancy. Visually, this game is sweet and simple. The textures are plain and often mere shades or primary colors, and since the cartoon world of Pac-Man is sweet and simple, the graphics not only present the game without much fuss, they don't detract from the fun, just like Pac-Man did in the old days. Honestly, if you step back for a moment, you'll see a million similarities to Nintendo's Super Mario 64, from the character design to the world levels themselves. Pac-Man World 2 does its job well when it comes to visuals. It's not a stunning piece of graphic wonderment or artfully designed to the extent that Picasso (or even Rothko) would be proud, but it's not meant to be, either. The game stays true to the innocent ways of Super Mario 64 and with the few exceptions of slowdown, there is very little to complain about visually. And honestly, I instantly loved little Pac-Man. He's so simple it's uncanny that he could be so cute. Did I mention his standing animations? They're adorable. Heck, the load screens of Pac-Man walking are cute. SoundThere is even less to talk about when it comes to sound. The sound theory behind this game is even more old-school than the graphics and gameplay. If you remember the 16-bit age of music, then you already know the music in this game. What can I say? It's arcade game music that's couched in four-bar progressions. It's repetitive. It's circus-like. It's childish. If you're playing the game, the music is a little repetitive but it's bearable. But if you're just sitting around reading and not playing the game, it's unforgivingly tortuous. And yet, despite all that, it felt like home. When it comes to 3D platformers, Pac-Man World 2 doesn't bring any new ideas to the table, but because the game is straight and true in its purpose -- it's a straight-up 3D platformer built to mimic Super Mario 64 -- it's hard to resist. And aside from the irresistible charm of Namco's little yellow beach ball, there are enough platform techniques, tricks, and ways to play the game throughout it that it warrants immediate inspection.Old-school gamers will be challenged and newbies may very well love it. There are some cheap tricks and the camera will annoy you to the very end, no doubt, but if you're forgiving and persistent, you may just spend the next 12 hours in Pac-Land.", "date": "Feb 27, 2002"}
