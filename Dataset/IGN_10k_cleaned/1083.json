{"name": "Duck Dodgers", "name_review": "Duck Dodgers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/07/duck-dodgers", "text": "Infogrames, long awaited Duck Dodgers delivers some fine platform action/adventure gaming despite the fact that it doesn't add much to the genre. We've all hopped from treacherous platform to treacherous platform, collected those precious super collectibles before and danced around those impossible boss characters before, but Duck Dodgers has everything going for it in the presentation department. As we mentioned in a previous feature, this game defines what our ~Presentation~ sub-rating is supposed to be.  If you've ever wished Daffy Duck would go left instead of right, or begged for him to use common sense, this is your chance to make it so. The Paradigm developed Duck Dodgers takes you into the Looney Tunes universe so effortlessly that you may want to watch for falling anvils and pianos when you're done. It's available for rental now, which we can definitely recommend, and it will be available for purchase later this year, which we can recommend only after you give it a rent.  Features  Play as Daffy Duck in his first interactive adventure for Nintendo 64. Use Porky Pig's hints to help Daffy defeat Marvin The Martian  Explore five huge planets and battle five ruthless bosses in more than 30 levels of fast, fun gameplay. Utilize  gizmos galore including the ACME jetpack, raygun and Instant Martain Decoys Classic Warner Bros. gags center around the ever-unreliable ACME products.  Familiar Looney scenes -- including Daffy's bill spinning around his head when shot. Rumble Pak support. Save the game directly to the cartridge with the battery back-up.   Story After positioning several ~PU-36 explosive space modulators~ in an unknown region of the solar system, Marvin the Martian is poised once again to destroy the universe. As Daffy Duck's futuristic alter ego, Duck Dodgers, players must work together with Porky Pig to uncover the powerful devices planted by the doomsday alien and thwart Marvin's dastardly plan.  Gameplay As we said, you'll hop from teetering platform to teetering platform, kick a few enemies, jump-stomp some boxes open and figure out a few puzzles every so often, so there's not much new to veteran platform gamers here. The fresh highlights will come from the mini-games, boss battles and side quests that allow the Looney Tunes universe to breathe and come to life.   Hassan, (known for his fondness of chopping things with his single-edged sword) has always been a favorite cartoon character of ours, so the chance to fight him was like a dream come true. It's not a dream that we'd  had very often, mind you , but a dream nonetheless. Likewise taking on The Crusher the boxer/wrestler that's known for taking lumps from Bugs Bunny is another great character from the good old days of cartooning that we were happy to come across. The thing is, when you meet Hassan or any of the other boss characters for example, they're very well done and completely in character, but you defeat them the same way you would any boss from Donkey Kong 64 or Banjo-Kazooie.   The level of difficulty is only there at all because of the game's poor control. It's actually a deadly combination of the game's control and the loose camera system. These two crucial elements of 3D platform games seem to disagree with each other throughout Duck Dodgers. Far too often, we found ourselves falling off of ledges and running around pickup items as the analog stick and floating camera always seemed to be pointed in the opposite directions of what the situation calls for. Extremely bad, loose control was one of the charms of 2D platform games of the past, but it's absolutely infuriating nowadays.   We know however, that the team at Paradigm didn't just push this game through the development process to get it out to market, because there are so many other details that they did pay attention to. The swimming controls were thought out very well and almost make you wish a bigger part of the game was underwater. Holding R and pushing the analog stick you can make Duck tiptoe around, complete with accompanying pizzicato violin notes, so you won't go sprinting off of narrow pathways. But even with great innovations like this, the control of Duck Dodgers is far too loose for our tastes. It's hard to get a feel for the physics of the game's world even when you're deep into the game.   Graphics The game looks a little blurry at times, especially some of the character faces, but for the most part, we're pleased with what this game does with the N64's graphics capabilities. You spend most of your time looking at the back of Daffy's head anyway, so it's important that the rest of the environment looks good. Also the animations are very cartoonish in nature, just the way you want them to be.   Daffy runs and walks like he did on television back in the day. In fact, all of the great Looney Tunes characters, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, the Abominable Snowman, they all move and act like they're Saturday morning counterparts.   The in-game cinemas are a very nice treat as they advance the story and give you even more lunacy while clearing hurdles in the game. If you strung all of those cut scenes together, you might even end up with a decent cartoon fresh for the year 2000. Who cares if it wouldn't make any sense?  Sound The audio elements combine with the great animation and cinemas to deliver that great Looney Tunes feels we're so in love with. Daffy runs his mouth throughout the entire game. His comments are nice and varied too. It's a good thing, because nobody else in the game says as much as he does, that is, if they say anything at all. ~a-HA!~ and ~mother,~ are just examples of the tiny little quips made famous by Mel Blanc (he's been in the big Acme factory in the sky for some time now) that define Looney Tunes. Nearly every Daffy Duck utterance is included in Duck Dodgers. And we're talking about ones that weren't even part of the Duck Dodgers cartoons too. ~Yoikes and away!~ was a catchphrase we remember from the Robin Hood cartoon and....  We're sorry, but we just get all fired up when we get a chance to use our knowledge of such trivial things.  The music is also a dead-on match of all those Looney Tunes favorites. In the old days, the music of the cartoons told the story as much as the zany characters. Our hats are off to Paradigm and Infogrames for re-creating the most obscure background music loops for the sake of accuracy in Duck Dodgers.  I am honestly very impressed with Duck Dodgers in how well it accomplished what it set out to do. From the get go, this was supposed to be a cartoon that you finally, after all these years, were going to get to control. While I know the next generation of systems will make that even closer to reality, in Duck Dodgers we have come as close as possible to that ideal. The music, voice samples, animations and overall Looney feel go a long way towards drawing my attention to what is otherwise an extremely average platform game. It's definitely worth a rental because some gamers out there may not be as fond of cartoons as they'd need to be to appreciate this game. When it comes to buying this game next month, that's another matter. A couple evenings of hardcore gaming should get you through this game in a jiffy and the luster of playing a cartoon will wear off quickly, so owning Duck Dodgers might not be necessary. Plus it's one of the few new games sitting on the shelves at Blockbuster anyway, so why wait?", "date": "Jul 7, 2000"}
