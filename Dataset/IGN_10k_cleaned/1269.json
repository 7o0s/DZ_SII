But just when you thought you've seen your last N64 football title, NFL Blitz 2001 comes running out of the locker room ready to rock your world.  Like those other football games, the Blitz series is nothing new to the N64. Every year we get our latest upgrade to this arcade classic, and this year is no exception. But for those unfamiliar with the series, be warned: this is not your standard game of football. Forget trying to outsmart your opponent, the point of Blitz is to break some teeth and to do it in style.  Features  1-4 players simultaneous Fast and furious arcade football action Fully licensed NFL teams and players for the 2000-2001 season Four modes of play: Arcade, Season, Tournament, and the new Party Games Create your own plays with the Playbook Editor Fully customizable playbooks and audibles Gameplay tips presented by the lovely Midway cheerleaders Designed for the N64 Expansion Pak Rumble Pak support Save data via N64 Controller Pak   Gameplay Like the years before, this latest batch of Blitz is absolutely out of control, and it rocks. Once you snap the ball, you've got a mix between a WWF match and a three-ring circus on your hands. Players fly through the air like human cannonballs and tumble across the grass in all directions. Quarterbacks scramble like mad and receivers fight to get open. Honestly, it's pretty much identical to last year's version, and that's not so bad -- unless of course you already own last year's version.  In addition to over-the-top action, NFL Blitz 2001 again packs all the attitude you can shake a defensive coordinator at. Nothing remotely sportsmanlike exists in this game; it was designed to get in your face and tell you when you suck. Players will point and laugh at you when you're down and even drop some late hits if they can. In fact, half the fun of the game is scrambling around after the whistle is blown and pile-driving the opposing players into the turf or knocking them into the sidelines. And if you don't like it, you can just get up and return the favor -- that's what this game is all about.  Blitz also strays from the traditional game of football in the technical aspects of the sport. A first down is 30 yards, not 10. There are no penalties whatsoever -- none. The best defense against a pass is to knock the receiver down early and often. Players can also enter secret codes prior to kickoff to earn even more wild features ranging from unlimited turbo to weather selection.  Gameplay in Blitz strictly revolves around the air attack since running plays are nowhere to be found in the playbook. And while there are plenty of offensive and defensive plays to choose from, strategy is really just a novelty in this game as you try to plow your way down the field as fast as possible. The Play Editor does allow you complete freedom to craft your own plays and is perhaps one of the best we've ever seen, but it seems that all plays are equally effective no matter how creative they are. The lack of strategy is easily overlooked, however, since it's almost more fun to forget the rules and tactics of the sport and simply play good smash mouth arcade football for a change.  The play control is appropriately simple, intuitive, and responsive. It's easy for newbies to grab a controller and go, yet it has enough subtleties to keep the hardcore fans mastering the moves for a while. All you really need to learn is how to turbo boost, but if you want to go further you can use that boost in combination with other buttons to throw stiff arms or spin moves. Again, it's 100% identical to last year so returning fans shouldn't expect any innovative control updates.  If you were hoping for some new play modes this year, then don't look here either. NFL Blitz 2001 brings back the standard choices including Arcade (i.e.: Exhibition) , Season, and Tournament (for up to eight players to compete alternately). So what's new for 2001? Well, last year's Trivia Challenge is now gone and replaced with three new Party Games. ~First and Goal Frenzy~ and ~Goal Line Stand~ both test your skill on offensive and defensive efficiency, while the ~QB Challenge~ attempts to sharpen your passing reflexes. These games help stretch the life of the single player experience to a degree, but honestly aren't enjoyable enough to keep you interested more than a few times.  Graphics This year we find that Blitz is actually a bit better looking than its predecessors. This is undoubtedly due to the use of the RAM Expansion Pak, which allows it to run at a slightly crisper resolution. But the difference is negligible and those playing without the system upgrade won't be missing a thing. The player models are still chunky as ever, but as always they manage to have a great sense of personality and style of their own due to the spectacular character animations.  You'll also be glad to hear that the framerate is again very good this time around. The Blitz games have always been loved for their fast action and blazing gameplay, and none of this would be possible without a slick framerate to go along. Since this is the first year Midway has taken advantage of the Expansion Pak, some may wonder if the graphics have been boosted to the point of dragging down the action. Rest assured that this isn't the case, and that the game runs just as smooth both with and without the pricey add-on.  Sound If you've heard this year's Blitz title, then you've heard 'em all. The effects are good but still remain identical to those of years past. Each play is filled with satisfying grunts and collisions when delivering the hits. The in-game music has been updated, but it still gets old just as fast as it used to. We ended up squelching it before halftime during our very first game -- it's kinda like something out of a swanky porn flick, unfortunately. You will hear the occasional player taunt after a big play, but the crowd is practically nonexistent and barely audible over the sounds of mass destruction on the field. And of course, what would any Blitz game be without our favorite Midway announcer there to rant and rave every time we deliver a punishing blow? Despite the fact that most of his lines sound oddly familiar, you gotta love that guy.  Multiplayer While the single player experience rocks, multiplayer is where the Blitz series really shines. Nothing is more satisfying than slamming your best friend into the dirt, and then showing him you really care with an extra clothesline or body slam. The same goes on offense as you bruise your way past defenders and hurdle into the end zone for a little celebration dance. Like last year, four players can now take to the field with up to two players per team. The personality of Blitz makes it the perfect game to pack four guys onto the couch for a little trash-talking and shoulder-punching fun.  If you want to get into the huddle and Under the Helmet of real NFL football, head over to NFL.com. With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. It's like they say -- ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it.~ But in this case I say -- ~if it ain't broke, don't buy the upgrade.~ For those of you who own the 2000 version of Blitz, I just can't recommend picking up NFL Blitz 2001 without first trading-in your old one. Both are very sweet arcade football games, and both are practically identical in terms of gameplay. Only a few minor features separate the two, and that just isn't enough to earn my fifty bucks. (NOTE: If you do plan on picking this game up, be sure you have an extra Controller Pak handy -- it takes all 123 pages of it.) For those of you who are new to the Blitz series and are interested in a little hardcore football, then look no further -- Blitz 2001 is ready to keep you entertained to the Super Bowl and beyond.", "date": "Sep 21, 2000"}
