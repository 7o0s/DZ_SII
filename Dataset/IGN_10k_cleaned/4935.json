{"name": "Baseball Heroes of the MLBPAA", "name_review": "Baseball Heroes", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/31/baseball-heroes", "text": "When Trip Hawkins throws his hat into a ring -- any ring -- there is a certain air of expectations. Electronic Arts was (is) big. The 3DO was a huge flop. 3DO as a software company produced some excellent games, but ultimately fizzled. And now Hawkins has thrown his lot in with the wireless industry -- a market that has its fair share of Capcoms and Konamis, but no Electronic Arts just yet. Will his new wireless firm, Digital Chocolate, become the behemoth?   Baseball Heroes, DChoc's first game to handsets, is a promising -- but slightly underwhelming -- start.   Features:   256 MLBPAA  5 game modes  customizable season/game lengths   Anybody looking for a deep baseball sim on their handset has no business downloading Baseball Heroes. This is arcade-style baseball with a bullet. The only things you need to trifle yourself with are pitching and batting. Base running and fielding are completely controlled by the game. For some players, such sacrilege will be just too much to bear. But for those that only want a five minute blast of baseball, Baseball Heroes offers some solid play.   Baseball Heroes' hook, besides delivering bite-sized play, is the presence of history's greatest ball players. Up to bat is Yogi Berra. Pitching is Rollie Fingers. Each player has pitching and hitting stats that relatively mirror their real-life achievements. That kind of old-school will give big baseball fans a little smile.   There are five game modes: Single Game, Home Run, Batting Challenge, Pitching Challenge, and Season Play. Baseball Heroes offers plenty of customization, such as adjusting the length of a season, or truncating a single game to a mere three innings. Tiny portions like this, and the Home Run derby, are perfect time-killers.   DChoc has purposefully gone against the grain with Baseball Heroes, concentrating solely on the batting and pitching. They believe that phones are best for shorter experiences like this, even at a time when other wireless developers are trying to stuff console-esque features into their titles. After all, look at the playbook depth of JAMDAT's NFL 2005. There are arguments to be made either way right now. Sure, Gameloft's excellent Splinter Cell titles are impressive, but JAMDAT Bowling is one of the top-selling handset games for a reason.   What game play there is, though, is pretty decent. Batting is all about timing. Starting your swing early enough to get the most out of the ball. Pitching is equally simplified, as you have a choice of pitches (depending on that classic thrower's strengths) and can use the number pad to put the heat in a specific zone over the plate. There's also an auto-pitch mode that takes it completely out of your hands, but using this features effectively halves the game play that was halved already.   At least the game does offer some additional baseball nuances, even if they aren't under your control, such as sacrifice flies, double plays, and errors. While it's frustrating to be the victim of an error when you have zero control over the fielding, at least it isn't a simple game of hit-catch-safe-out.   What surprised us most about Baseball Heroes, even more than the simplified play, is the look of the game. This game could have easily come out two years ago. The sound suffers from a similar ~last year~ syndrome.  Baseball Heroes is not a bad game. If you just want a simple baseball game that can be enjoyed for a few minutes at a time, then DChoc has you pegged. However, I suspect that gamers may be turned off when they find out there is no fielding or base running. There's just something about having options taken away from you, versus turning them off yourself. There's a reason people crapped all over SEGA's GameCube baseballer, Home Run King. However, I did find myself enjoying the simplicity of the game (once I took it off of the cakewalk rookie mode) between other tasks, like cooking dinner or waiting to upload a series of files to a slow FTP server. And that's probably the ~zone~ where Baseball Heroes succeeds best.", "date": "Aug 31, 2004"}
