The latest late 80s acquisition? Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden, one of the more exquisite, venerable games in the NES catalog. Does it stand the proverbial ~test of time?~   Features:   First of four planned chapters  NES-quality visuals  Original soundtrack   Ninja Gaiden is an extremely accurate translation of the classic ninja slasher. The story of Ryu Hayabusa has entranced gamers for well over a decade (witness the excellent revival of the franchise on Xbox), and on this newest screen, the game play is still very compelling. if you were a fan of the original NES game, this mobile game will be impossible to resist on sight alone.   However, there is something which must be pointed out immediately -- something to keep in the back of your head before you hit ~buy~ and beef up your phone bill. This is not the complete Ninja Gaiden game. Just like Upstart Games is parceling out Castlevania, Tecmo Mobile has split Ninja Gaiden into multiple acts. Each act consists of a few levels. Only by buying all of the acts will you be able to complete the game.   Now, if you're okay with multiple purchases that will inevitably surpass the $13 mark, then downloading this first chapter is a no-brainer. The game is as playable as ever. All of the enemies, weapons, jumps, and environments are true to the NES classic. Even the between round cinema sequences are intact -- complete with stilted dialogue.   The control is fantastic, even with the omission of the duck feature. Pressing down on the touch pad (or stick) now unleashes special attacks. Fortunately, you don't really need to duck to fulfill your duties as ~ninja extraordinaire.~ With a quick jab to the designated action button, Ryu slices enemies in half.   Ninja Gaiden includes three action stages and a boss battle. Plowing through these levels is still a challenge, as your enemies are no legion of morons. It still takes time and practice to burn through a level. And the boss battle? Extremely entertaining.   The game is a near mirror of the NES game. Ninja Gaiden's levels look exactly the same, including a very loyal color palette. The animation is limited, but it looks very close to the original. The game also includes the same music, but it seems very dialed down for handsets. The audio is missed, but that's no fault of Tecmo Mobile.If you are anything of a fan of the original NES game -- or even a newcomer that first bloodied your sword on the Xbox neo-classic -- then downloading Ninja Gaiden will be almost instinctual. The fact that the game is only a fraction of the original may cause some hesitation, but there's no contract saying you have to buy the later chapters, too. So, if you can get past that -- and I recommend you find a way to -- there is much fun to be had with Ninja Gaiden. There's a reason why this series is considered such a seminal video game franchise. And for a few bucks, you'll be reminded why.", "date": "Jul 16, 2004"}
