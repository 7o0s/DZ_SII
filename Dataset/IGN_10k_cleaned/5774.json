We had the distinct displeasure of downloading MFORMA's Elektra this week, a paint-by-numbers actioner without soul, without inspiration, and certainly without fun.   Now, let's disclose this right away. We downloaded the game on a Sanyo 8200. Not the fanciest phone, but one in very wide use. At E3 2005, we took care to mentally note the kinds of phones basic users have and saw no shortage of 8200s on the showfloor in very regular use. So, naturally the edition of Elektra we played on the 8200 was graphically behind some of the lead handsets that MFORMA had in mind for the game. See the screens we have at the bottom here? The 8200 edition is way behind them with itty-bitty sprites and far less detail to them.   But since the money of people who use 8200s is as green as everybody else's, we're taking a few cracks at this edition of Elektra. (We did this once before with Gameloft's Asphalt: Urban GT. We were surprised by the positive feedback from readers who appreciated that we played a game not on the finest handset.)   Anyway, back to how boring Elektra is. You play as both the titular heroine and a mysterious child -- using a number key, you can switch the characters out on the fly. Each has a specialty. Elektra is stronger. Her sidekick has greater range. But guess what? You won't die as either character because the game puts up very little challenge.   Elektra's foes are numerous -- masked ninjas from The Hand, a nefarious organization. But few of these ninjas behave with any measure of skill or stealth. They simply run around, left-to-right and back again, waiting to be stuck. Some of the ninjas drop health power-ups, some drop throwing stars, while others drop increases to the clock. (The ninjas with power-ups glow, so you know which ones you absolutely have to kill versus those you can simply run past.) Time constantly trickles away, you must complete a level before the seconds are zeroed out or else Elektra fall down go boom.   There are boss encounters, but they are very uneventful. Several of them were downed by simply laying on the action button -- without moving. You can also fill up Elektra's rage meter and unleash some special attacks, with make mincemeat of boss ninjas and The Hand executives. Too easy to be remotely engaging.   Control on the 8200 was a little iffy, but sometimes that's the fault of the aging handset, so it's hard to level that complaint completely at Elektra.   As mentioned, the visuals were muted and unimpressive, but at least there are different level backgrounds. After several levels in the forest we were a little nervous that we might never get out, but after a while you will start seeing other locations, such as a mansion.  Man, Elektra is a downer. If we come across the game on a more powerful handset, we may download it and give it another look, but the basic mechanics -- showcased by the limited tech of the 8200 -- prove the game to be remarkably shallow. After seeing some of the upcoming games at E3, it's hard to be easy on games like Elektra. Mobile games have finally come into their own, and review scores need to now reflect that. Sorry, Elektra, that you had to be one of the first games to be reviewed after the shift.", "date": "May 28, 2005"}
