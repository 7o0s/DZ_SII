Pyramids before turning back the covers. Because there's the distinct possibility you will look over at the clock, see it say 1AM, and then let loose with a grumble of curse words that would make your mother cry.   Yahoo! recently stated its commitment to provided mobile games, and if they have any more in the back room like Yahoo! Pyramids, they stand to make a boatlad of money. Yahoo! Pyramids is a wonderfully addictive little card game that takes about three minutes to figure out (like we're about to read the instructions) and about forever to master.   It's a ~sorta-like~ take on solitaire. There are three triangles of cards on the screen. The bottom row is all face-up. The remainder of the cards are face-down. If you eliminate the two cards in front of a face-down card, it turns face-up. You get ride of face-up cards by linking them to a card at the bottom of the screen. If the card is one increment greater or lesser than your card, you can link it, regardless of suit.   You have a deck you can draw from, but you can only go through it one time. Investigate all options before burning through the deck. Don't just hope against hope that one of the last few cards will magically unlock a chain for you. Chances are it won't.   Yahoo! Pyramids is freakishly addictive. In fact, the more games you lose, the more you want to play because you know you could have done better if maybe you had scanned the screen better or not been so impatient with diving into the deck.Between Yahoo! Pyramids and Zuma, my hand hurts. It's been curled around a cellphone more in one sitting in the last few days than I can remember. This is a very cheap download (I paid $1.99 for the subscription) and I know I'll certainly get my month's worth -- and there's a rock-solid chance I'll keep it another month. Come to think of it, maybe I should have just paid for the whole download at once. You should. Learn from my mistakes.", "date": "Mar 12, 2005"}
