Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Destruct-o-Thon is a pretty rudimentary way to force the license into the mobile space. The game essentially relies on your ability to press the ~5~ button. If you can do so in rhythm, even better.   The goal is to hit objects as far as you possibly can with the three heroes. Apples, radios -- whatever. Every level has a specific point goal, which is reached by adding your distance to any collected point bonuses on the smash course.   To begin, you select your mission and character. Then, a meter at the top of the screen appears, which a tick mark moving back and forth. You build up speed before hitting the target by tapping ~5~ when the mark is in the center of the meter. Once you reach the edge of your running space, an angle meter starts rising and falling. You tap ~5~ again to select the angle at which you want to hit the object. 45-degrees is usually best.   Then the object goes soaring across the course. If your angle is too low, the object will skid to a stop way early. If it's to high, the target flies up in the air and lands with a thud not too far from your starting point. While the object bounces across the course, it can use the occasional spring to give it more loft. There are also little point bonus spheres on the course. Unfortunately, your object can be slowed or stopped by fire patches.   And that's it. Sixteen levels of this. One of the biggest bummers about Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Destruct-o-Thon, other than its limited scope, is that because you always have your eye on the meters, you never get to enjoy the fact you're playing as a member of the team. But at least the goals and little dialogue boxes are as off-kilter as the show. And when you do spy them, the Aqua Teens' sprites are clear and detailed.  The name alone, Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Destruct-o-Thon, should clue you into the fact that this is a brief, but silly, affair. But despite my affinity for the show, I couldn't help but be disappointed by how short-sighted the game is. Hit stuff? Use a single key to fill meters? What is this, 2002? Macrospace is a talented house with some outrageously good games -- sadly, Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Destruct-o-Thon just isn't one of them.", "date": "Dec 10, 2004"}
