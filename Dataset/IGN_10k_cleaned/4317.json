{"name": "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King", "name_review": "Return of the King", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/10/return-of-the-king", "text": "On December 17, New Line is releasing the final chapter of Peter Jackson's epic, acclaimed ~Lord of the Rings~ trilogy, ~Return of the King.~ Will Frodo successfully make it to the fires of Mount Doom? Will Aragorn lead humans to victory at Gondor, reclaiming his throne? Will hobbits cry a lot? All will be answered in your local multiplex, or if you're really impatient, JAMDAT's new adventure game based on the film.  Features: Eight levels Seven members of the Fellowship Uncover items to aid in your quest Post your scores on JAMDAT's leaderboard Find the Precious!  Needless to say, attempting to tackle the epic nature of Tolkien's classic on a itty-bitty handset took some guts on JAMDAT's part. The book and film contain some of the largest, most intense battles in fiction. The real surprise here, though, is that the game maker manages to not only pull it off, but also craft one of the best cellphone games we've ever played.  Return of the King is a side-scrolling action game with some sturdy adventure and RPG elements. As you complete the entwined storylines, from Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring to Aragorn's last-ditch stand at the Back Gates of Mordor, you move from left to right, hack and slashing at familiar enemies like Orcs and Uruk-Hai. Use Gandalf's staff to repel Trolls in the White City. Sam's bravery saves the day at the castle of the chief Ringwraith.  Being able to play as all of the characters from the film, as well as encounter many others, such as Gollum, really lends to the game's authenticity. Each character is armed with the specific weapon, such as Aragorn's sword, Frodo's dagger, and Gandalf's white staff.  As you explore the levels, battling enemies (with a fairly decent control set-up, mind you), keep an eye open for two things: traps and items. Traps, such as pits and spikes will drastically injure your character - or even lead to certain, immediate death. There are also exploding barrels that you can use against hordes of foes, if you hit them with a projectile from far away. Make a barrel go boom from to close, and you'll bear the brunt of the blast yourself.  Items are liberally sprinkled through the levels. Extra projectiles will replenish your ranged weapons (such as Legolas' elfin bow) and power portions replace spent special powers. Also keep an eye out for treasure, Kingsfoil to refill your health bar, and 1-Ups to extend game time.   Return of the King looks fantastic for a handset game. Far more detailed than JAMDAT's previous Two Towers, title, Return of the King's detailed backgrounds really do approximate such locations as Mordor's Gates, Minas Mongul, and Gondor. The characters are easily recognizable, and the animation, while limited, is still fairly fluid.  Return of the King begins with a rousing score, but cannot keep up the aural pleasure during game play. Once you're in the game, all that's heard are weapon clashes and enemy cries. And Sam's screams as he falls down a hole. Silly fat hobbitses. Return of the King is quite easily the best handset game I have played this year. Does my affinity for the license affect my judgment? Probably, but keep in mind, if it had been a horrid, cheapie port, my love for the books and films would have resulted in the kind of nasty tirade I leveled at Looney Tunes Zany Race. Developer Imaginengine deserves Ent-sized kudos for making this game work, and showing other developers not only not how properly craft a licensed game, but also just how to craft a game, period.", "date": "Dec 10, 2003"}
