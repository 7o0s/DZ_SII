So if EA Sports is the New York Yankees of computer baseball, then perhaps Interplay is the Oakland A's--they've got enough resources to field a team, but will always come up short when it counts. Such seems to be the case with VR Baseball 2000, the only baseball game this year that managed to come out after the season ended.  Once you get it installed and fight your way pass the nag screens (this game is more insistent on you registering it than most shareware programs), you'll find a no-frills, fairly basic arcade baseball game. The character animation is fluid but Spartan, and there are no coaching or simming options to speak of, so the game's only selling point is standout gameplay where it matters most--the duel between pitcher and batter.  Much has been made of VR Baseball 2000's use of the Messiah technology--the 3D engine developed by Shiny Entertainment--to power the character animation. And indeed, the characters are sharply drawn, with a depth of detail on par with this year's other baseball games. A little jaggedness crops up along round surfaces like the bat's edge, shadows are starkly angular, and legs float in quite a few of the frames, but overall, the players flow smoothly.  What they lack is animation variety. For example, the player will get up to the plate, take a few cuts, and then swing. If he gets a hit, he'll run to base. If not, he snaps back to the dugout. There's no angry kicking the dirt or wild gesticulations. No pitcher checking the rosin bag, or shaking off a sign.   The infielders maintain a singularly simian crouch for the better part of the game, only turning and leaping at the last second as the ball enters their invisible 'catch box'. This isn't graceful gameplay but starkness. These players are singularly robotic.  In contrast, this year's crop of football games, which by definition have more players doing more things than baseball games, have plenty of end zone celebrations, wild tackles, all sorts of moves that help create an NFL atmosphere, but there are just enough animations in VR Baseball 2000 to round out a Cactus League game. It doesn't feel done.  The same can be said for the audio. There is no play-by-play announcer or color man, just a stadium guy who rattles off the player's name, and an umpire who sounds like he has a ferret in his throat. The crowd cues are all off--they'll cheer a foul ball in the third but will croak nary a peep if the home team pulls out a win in the ninth. Cheesy stadium rock cues up at random and won't let up even after a play starts.  Where VR Baseball 2000 starts to do things right is when a batter faces a hitter, and there are enough options let you tailor this part of the game to your own tastes. The ball can be thrown in two speeds--fast or normal, and the hitting mode can be set to either arcade or sim, the latter being more realistic and so more difficult.  The ball comes across the plate at a pretty good clip, and you use the D-pad to indicate what part of the plate you're trying to protect with your bat, essentially guessing where the pitch is going to go. Three kinds of swings are possible, as is typical--a normal swing, a home run rip, and a bunt.  What is not modeled is aiming the ball with your bat after the swing, so you can't really pull the ball to one side or try to keep it down for a grounder. Nor can you adjust your batter's position in the box or try to check swing. These omissions oversimplify the hitting game.  This is not the case with pitching, which is the most fully realized part of the game. Besides the genre standards of choosing your pitch type and location, you also can choose pitch speed. This is a great touch because it expands your pitching repertoire, letting you vary speeds on fastballs and sliders, hanging on to hard throws for the better hitters, husbanding your stamina over the course of a long game.  All the information you need about your pitcher can be found by hitting F2. Here you'll find your current stamina rating, pitch count, and a breakdown of the types of pitches you've thrown (though unfortunately not a rating for the quality of each kind of pitch you throw; for that you have to go digging through the menus).   You'll also find a sharp scouting graph that maps locations for all the pitches you've thrown and color codes them by type. Furthermore, the game actually models pitchers working from either the windup or the stretch. So as far as pitching goes, VR Baseball 2000 is outstanding, the best I've seen this year, even if you are forced to pitch from the catcher's point of view.  Baserunning approaches pitching in the amount of detail involved. You have the power to have all players take a long lead, or just a specific runner. The same goes for steals or a hasty return to the bag; and when the ball is hit you can choose to advance, return or slide all baserunners singly or as a group.  Unfortunately fielding is not handled as well. For fielding, there's no auto-field option, meaning you have to control your fielders, and due to the way the camera tracks the ball in flight, you can't always tell which fielder is currently under your control. A toggle lets you set AI assistance through nine increments, meaning the computer will move the appropriate player towards the ball, but you're still expected to take control at the last second.  Defensive playcalling is limited strictly to positioning your outfielders. Now why would you be able to position your outfielders and not your infield? There's almost no point trying to pick off the runner at second base, since you won't have anyone at the bag trying to hold the runner on. Want to cheat down the third base line to stop a bunt? Well you can't.  There's little incentive to position your outfielders either, since the option again is buried under a mouse menu. You have to hit escape and then use the mouse to reposition your players, and then go back in the game. Why isn't this accessible through the gamepad?  And for would-be managers, stats nuts and simmers, forget it. There is no trading AI--it's up to you to move players around. No career mode, no training camp, no draft, no salary cap--little but a season long schedule that you can sim fairly easily. All-Star balloting is included, which is kind of nice, and there's the standard home run derby.   Altogether, there's just enough of a game here to play arcade baseball but little else. If that's enough for you, then VR Baseball 2000 is probably worth a look. But if you're expecting more out of your gaming dollar, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.  The majority of the complaints leveled against VR Baseball 2000 are problems that could have been solved had more time been spent on the game. The depth and care spent on the pitching interface, for example, is in sharp contrast to all the other aspects of the game--it's as if pitching had been done first, and similarly detailed models for batting and fielding were left out because the developers ran out of time.  And though a game should be evaluated solely on its own merits, independent of its publishers previous efforts or future endeavors, one cannot help but wonder if Interplay's current financial problems played any part in this game's unfinished look and feel.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Nov 6, 1998"}
