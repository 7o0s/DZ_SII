Despite the fact that there have been recent movements in this country to try and bring F1 to the masses, it won't likely compete with the likes of NASCAR any time soon until there's at least some kind of real American presence.   Even still, with the recent 2001 SAP United States Grand Prix in Indianapolis still on the minds of some, the popularity of world's most popular motor sport is likely at its highest point here in the States since Mario Andretti won the Formula One world title in 1978.    With the release the Studio Liverpool developed Formula One 2001 that's being shipped under the 989 Sports brand name, Sony is surely hoping to bring its world-renown F1 franchise to new fans of the sport that might not have cared about an F1 videogame a few years ago.   Gameplay The problem with this is that if you haven't played an F1 simulation before, you'll be in for a serious shocker here. Even with this game set on the novice difficulty level with the driving aids for things like abs and traction control turned on, Sony's racer has a pretty steep learning curve that will likely be too much for most newcomers.  And don't even think that your mastery of the Gran Turismo games will help you out the least, because it won't. Despite the fact that GT3 offered an accurate representation of driving real-life automobiles and sports cars on a track, it was extremely forgiving as a racing game and driving an F1 car is a completely different monster.   You brake too late; you can expect a tire to lock and your car to slam uncontrollably into a wall. Sure, turning the driving aids on will help you out a bit in taking turns and braking, but you're going to want to learn how to brake at the right time, taking correct racing lines, and accelerate properly if you don't want to spend the majority of your time in the grass and in last place.  Accordingly, we can't really suggest picking this game up unless you're a hardcore F1 simulation fan or willing to put in the time needed to become one. The learning curve is really steep and the sad truth is that it has some control issues that might even disappoint the most hardcore of simulation freaks. Using the Dual Shock 2 controller, steering feels a bit overly loose and squirrelly and it often feels like you're racing on a completely slick surface instead of pavement. For instance, when making hard turns in an F1 car, it will shake and stutter a bit going through the turn -- in this game, the car just smoothly floats through the turn, as if the tires and road aren't even making any contact.  It can be argued that looseness of the control might more accurately represent the responsiveness of a real F1 car, but if that's honestly the case, it's sometimes better to side against reality if it's for the sake of making the game more enjoyable. Aside from the squirrelly control, users may find that using the standard buttons on the controller for gas and brake simply don't get the job done, especially when playing with the more advanced gameplay settings.   The pressure sensitive buttons don't give you nearly enough leeway to gas and brake correctly through the more advanced turns and if your preference is to use these buttons, you're going to find yourself out of control more often than you'd like. Things are handled a bit better when you use the right analog stick for the braking and gassing duties as it's easier to feather the gas coming out of turns instead of flooring it, which is what usually happens with the button -- causing you to spin out of control, but if you're against using the stick, you're simply SOL.   Using the Driving Force/GT Force steering wheel is probably the best way to play the game as it gives you the most precision with the gas and brake for going into and coming out of turns. The steering is still a bit loose for my personal tastes, but if you spend enough time with it, it definitely is learnable.   For those that don't have a problem with the squirrelly steering or don't mind using something other than the face buttons for gas and brake duties, there's a lot here for F1 fans to be excited about. Not only are all of the current F1 drivers and tracks represented, but there are a wide variety of play modes, and the tweakable options are pretty deep, as things such as tire compound, tire setup, front/rear brake balance, ride height, fuel load, steering angle, front/rear wing angles, springs, anti-roll, and cambers can be adjusted. There are also three different camera views -- nose, TV-pod (behind driver), and exterior -- so you can race from any view that you wish.  Graphics Outside of the issues with the game's control, the biggest complaint that people will likely have with Formula One 2001 is its graphics. While it does run at what appears to be 60 frames per second in single player mode with a full F1 race field of 22 cars, it comes at a serious cost as far as texture quality is concerned. The tracks and backgrounds are poorly textured and lit and subsequently put forth a very flat and lifeless feel. The cars aren't all that much better, as many of the flat panels on the vehicles look to be a flat-textured polygon and not a part of an actual car.   There rain effects are actually quite nice, though, and the game does have a lot of nice touches such as the bobbing of the driver's helmet when you play from the TV-pod view and the shaking of the steering wheel. However, you'll be hard pressed to find many people that find these visuals to be impressive. Sure, you're not likely going to get a game that looks as good as something like GT3 if you have 22 cars on the track, but you should be able to get something that looks better than this.   Sound The biggest problem with the audio in Formula One 2001 is that the engine noises seem to be a bit too clean and the changes of the engine sounds while shifting gears or braking aren't really all that noticeable. On the other hand, the engine noises from car to car are actually noticeable. It's a very minor difference, as it should be, but a noticeable difference nonetheless. It's also worth noting that the sounds for things like downshifting and riding over the rumble strips are almost unnoticeable at times, especially when the annoying music is on (we suggest turning it off before you even start).   The announcing seems typical of what you'd expect from an F1 game, but there doesn't seem to be any improvements in the delivery. The annoying British announcer will scream stuff like he would on a television broadcast, which is fine, but the lines delivered are broken up when names are said, as they don't seem to mesh together all that well.  Having never driven a real-life F1 car, it's hard to say whether or not Formula One 2001 really is an accurate simulation of Formula One racing, but in comparison to EA's F1 2001, it definitely feels like it's more of true-to-life simulation. The learning curve is really steep, but patient users will be able to learn to be successful in this game if they put some effort into learning its nuisances. It's just that most people will probably give up before they ever get to this point.", "date": "Oct 8, 2001"}
