It nailed its entry into the genre with 1998's Motocross Madness for the PC and has been improving upon its formula ever since. With tight controls, great level design and an adherence to the sport it simulates that most other developers can't quite get, Rainbow's ~franchise~ has been king of the hill for years now.   Its seventh offroad game is upon us in the form of MX vs. ATV Untamed, with Tantalus handling the PSP take on the release. The game takes most of the elements from Rainbow's previous games and continues to refine their design. Nearly a decade after its initial offering though, the studio, and its partners like Incinerator, seem to be running out of ideas on how to further the experience. Considering the options that have been in its games for years, that's not too surprising. There are new modes and event types, sure, but the core gameplay hasn't changed in a while, so while it's still strong, what you'll find here will feel very familiar.    What MX vs. ATV Untamed does very well though is retain Rainbow Studios' excellent control mechanics. Every vehicle in the game controls in a very arcadey manner, but with full simulation influence at your disposal. What we mean by this is that you can turn on a dime and the game is rarely punishing, allowing you to land some crazy jumps and cut corners like a knife, but at the same time you can use your clutch for cornering and acceleration techniques or master the art of preloading your jumps in order to hit hills properly.   It's this mix between arcade and simulation controls that has defined the franchise for years now, and MX vs. ATV Untamed keeps this in tow quite well. Each of the vehicle types, be it a bike, ATV, buggie, truck or what have you, controls differently, but quite well.   Though the game features the X-Cross championship like the PS3 and 360 versions, it's a vastly different setup. A number of divisions are present, and once you've earned enough points in one division you'll unlock the next one, with more intelligent AI, better vehicles and so forth. It works reasonably well as you don't need to finish first in every event.   The other main career mode drops you into a level and has you exploring the lands to find event markers. Or, you can press Start and choose an event from a list, which works much better because you can't really tell which events you've completed while on the course nor can you tell which icon is which event until you get to them.   You'll find plenty of events to race in, though they're not without their problems. A number of these events has issues, however. The computer assist in the races is pretty bad, with the computer falling behind and then speeding up to pass you again and again. This can be frustrating when you've been basically perfect but still manage to fail. The Stunt Attack has you take a number of ramps, each of which have a point total you must beat in order to open the next ramp, all while a timer counts down. This is fine in concept except that some of the ramp placement is poor (like sending you through a group of trees). As well, the manner in which you land your bikes gives you anywhere between an ~Ouch~ and ~Perfect~ rating, which affects what percentage of the total possible points you'll receive for the trick, but it's really difficult to see how level your rider is just before landing. It almost became a random game of ~Hope He Lands It Well~ again and again until we'd finish the events.   We also have issues with the vehicle unlocking system. Different rides have different statistics, and many are earned through a milestone achievement system. You earn medals for things like your total career airtime, total trick points, etc., which earn you new vehicles, gear and so forth, but you can't tell what's going to unlock what before you finally get there. When you've started to fall behind in races and really need a new bike, you may find it difficult to figure out how to earn a new one.MX vs. ATV Untamed on the PSP is a solid racing title, though it has plenty of flaws. The control mechanics are great, but there are issues with landing a trick cleanly, item placement for some of the goals and sometimes frustrating computer assist. If you're into offroad racing then it's certainly worth a look, but don't expect perfection.", "date": "Dec 19, 2007"}
