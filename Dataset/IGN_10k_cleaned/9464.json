The disc-based add-on peripheral allowed the TG-16 to support games pressed onto CD-ROM media, and those games that shipped on disc instead of the traditional Turbo HuCard format often benefited from significant boosts in graphics and sound. That's the case here for Gate of Thunder  because though you've had the chance to see several side-scrolling shooters come from the Turbo system to the Virtual Console before, you've never seen (or heard) any quite as good as this.Gate of Thunder sounds spectacular. Its soundtrack is amazing, and fully capitalizes on the potential of the CD media the game was originally developed for  you'll be stunned to hear how good it sounds, especially if you've never played a Turbo CD game before. It's rock-based, heavy on the guitar, fast-paced and full of rich bass. It's a perfect compliment, actually, to the recently-released Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock  if you've already got your sound system turned up to 11 after a few rounds of Slow Ride on Expert in that game, you can just keep it cranked while you jump over to Gate to let your whammy hand rest.Though your thumbs won't get much of a break, as Gate demands quick action on the triggers to keep up with everything the alien enemy forces are dishing out  unlike some shooters which only task you to constantly hold down a single fire button while dancing and dodging around unfriendly fire, Gate of Thunder additionally asks you to juggle three different alterable aspects of your ship.Still shots do little justice to Gate of Thunder's dynamic scrolling backgrounds.The first is its speed, and three different settings are available there  normal, slower than normal, and way too much faster than normal. The Minus Button toggles between them, and you don't have to collect any power-ups or anything like that to activate the feature  speed-switching is always available, and you can always adjust your ship's maximum velocity to your liking, adapting to different situations as they arise.The second customizable feature of your ship is its direction of attack. While your main vessel will always fire its weapons straight ahead to the right side of the screen, a double-tap of the 1 Button will make your accompanying options turn around and fire behind you. You can send some ordnance out to cover your aft, switch back to fire full force to the front, switch back to attack behind again ... and so on and so forth, as often as you want.Finally, there are three different styles of primary weapon that you can swap between with the 2 Button at any time, after you've collected them as power-ups. The beginning gun is a straight, no-frills laser, but you'll also come across a wider-ranged green wave projector and an explosives sheller called the Earthquake. Most other games in the shooter genre allow only one active weapon at a time, and will usually replace your current gun when you grab a power-up of some different type. But Gate of Thunder stacks them all up, keeping any extras in reserve for when, and if, you choose to toggle over to them.So there's a lot of variety and possibility in Gate of Thunder's gameplay, and you feel more engaged in piloting this ship than you would behind the flight stick of others, in other games. There are only seven levels to fly through and conquer here, which is a bit disappointing but also about on par for the shooter genre  and if you find yourself getting cocky at having too easily cleared the game on its Normal difficulty setting, there are additional maddening levels of challenge to face. Hard Mode makes things quite a bit tougher, and the even more insane Devil Mode will likely have you tearing out your hair in clumps. So fair warning there.Gate of Thunder was an absolutely excellent choice to become the first game in the Wii Shop to have come from the TurboGrafx-CD. And while its branding there and on your Wii's Channel Array won't reflect that, it's undeniable once you launch the game  the soundtrack is explosive, and sounds amazing even when adapted into VC digital distribution form from its original CD source. Gate's gameplay, too, separates it from other side-scrolling shooters by keeping you more engaged, with more choices to make in the middle of tense firefights  will you take things slow, or set the ship to maximum speed? Will you attack all out in front, or split your focus to cover the rear as well? Overall, Gate of Thunder is just a very solid, satisfying and musically impressive title that is well worth your 800 Wii Point investment. So check it out.", "date": "Nov 9, 2007"}
