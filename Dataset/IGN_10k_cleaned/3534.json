A few have come close, but none has kept its appeal for me long enough to do so.     When Grand Prix Challenge came out, it seemed to slip under the radar  (my local Electronics Boutique only got one copy in).  Further, it was priced at $29.95.  Not a promising sign for me as someone who generally adopts the ~you get what you pay for~ philosophy.   When I popped it into my PS2, I expected sub-par graphics, with framerates that dive whenever more than a few cars are on the screen, arcade-ish handling, braindead AI and all the other horrors we've experienced in release after release.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself sitting at the back of a grid in a quick race, and all 22 cars roared off at a liquid smooth frame rate, from the cockpit or airbox view, with animated flags waving in the grandstands and tire smoke being churned up.  Whoa.   OK, well, the replay just HAS to be awful, right? EA's title only gives you the last several seconds of replay, or maybe a few sections of ~race highlights~ comprising less than a minute of viewing time.  Instead, I get the ENTIRE RACE.  Now in this case this was about 10-15 minutes of game time.  I haven't yet tried to run a full-length race to find out where the cut off is, but all of the 10 lappers I've run have replayed in their entirety!  Oh, and the framerate stays totally smooth throughout.  What's more, the image quality isn't crap, either.  Flags are waving smoothly from the grandstands; there are some kinds of smoke-pots among the crowd churning out colored smoke, which waft into the air, and a helicopter overhead tracks above whomever the leader is.   The car models are at least as polygon heavy as any car I've seen from the competition, and the tracks are spot on.  The asphalt surface is varied and has some reflected sheen off of it when it's lit up.  Track surfaces are irregular enough to keep life interesting.  Going down the front straight in Monaco will loosen teeth, and try to overdo the shortcut at the Variante Alfa chicane in Imola and you can literally flip your car.   Draw distance isn't a problem, either.  It's been quite some time since I've really crowed about the graphics in a PS2 game.  Admittedly, these graphics aren't perfect, but they are the best I've seen in a F1 racer on a console, and they don't slow down the machine as well.  I think many people seeing both the Xbox and the PS2 in front of the TV could be forgiven if they assumed I was looking at an Xbox title.  It's just that smooth.   There IS one big ~BUT~ that rears its ugly head:  NO MIRRORS.  The sound helps make up for this, by clearly giving you the additional engine sounds around you.  Usually I really miss a mirror, and I do miss it here as well.  However, it's the least bothered I've ever been about its absence, perhaps because I do feel situational awareness well enough to drive competitively here, due to the sound and the overall sense of where things are you get from the various cameras.  A glance back button is available, and it's useful to take a peek down a long straight to see whether someone is trying to slipstream by.   The sound is also right off the in-car sounds of an F1 broadcast.  There is the familiar in-car buzz combined with the shriek of F1 cars at high revs.  There isn't a great deal of difference between cars.  But what's there sounds very nice, right up through the rev range.  Shifting by sound is definitely doable here.  The whacks of the cars bumping one another is lousy, but then so is everything about the cars bumping into one another, and I'll cover that in more detail later.   The next major thing is drivability.  The best looking, best sounding game will fall apart if it doesn't ~feel~ good to drive.  This game has a split personality in this regard.  Using a standard dual shock analog controller, steering the game will take a fair bit of getting used to.  Using a Logitech FF steering wheel, the game just vaults up the charts and becomes incredibly responsive and feels great.  The dual shock sticks have a problem in that most people crank the stick around a great deal.  Here, finesse is at a premium.  The barest nudge is all that is often necessary to do things, and gaining that level of sensitivity is quite hard.  This is far more sensitive than Gran Turismo is.  As a result, the beginning of gameplay here will be frustrating as you constantly bump the car left and right just trying to make it go straight.  I have a particular problem since I drive the racing line fairly religiously and try to use every single inch of race track.  Trying to align the wheel with the white line on the edge of the road will more often that not cause me to put a wheel off into the dirt.  This would be incredibly obnoxious if ~flypaper grass~ were implemented to prevent cheating.  Thankfully it only slows you down a little bit.  Cheating is instead prvented with a solidly implemented rules system and well-placed curbs that will punish you for abusing them too badly.   With time and effort, I got competent with the dual analog controller, but nothing is better than a Logitech wheel here.  If you get this game because you're interested in F1 racing, you really should snag a Logitech wheel to get the full effect of it.  PS2 fans have something that Xbox fans conceivably never will, and they should enjoy it.  I can position the car pretty much where I want with the wheel, and cut smooth, flowing lines around the track.  The wheel shudders and wrenches over the curbs and when I touch other cars.  The feel is addictive and superb.    The physics model is obviously going to be less than the ones you'll find in the better PC F1 sims, and here, that's not a bad thing (imagine that dual shock controller situation combined with an already-difficult physics model!).  The sense of weight transfer, over steer, and under steer, is incredibly good.  The car can fishtail when you jump the throttle too hard, or when you bang off the curbs while turning too hard.  It will over steer through hairpins if you push too hard.  Only the snobbiest of PC sim fans will turn their nose up at this game.  Arcade fans will find it to be fun, too, thanks to three levels of control which allow you to enjoy various combinations of braking assistance, anti-lock brakes, and 2 levels of traction control, which can be toggled on the track (an indicator flashes during gameplay to show you as the traction control engages to correct your sloppy driving!).  Lap times are very comparable to actual real life lap times on the F1 tracks, with no cheesy driving techniques needed as has been the case in some competitors' titles.   The AI is one area that could use some work, although it's not the worst I've seen by any means.  They are aggressive.  They will seldom concede a corner to you, often going wheel to wheel with you through it.    They fight with each other, weaving around the track, trying to get an edge on each other, and will occasionally cause a mess on the track.  Drafting is actually implemented nicely here, and you really need to tuck under a car during long straights to get a good slingshot.     The damage model could also use work, as even when activated, you have to hit someone multiple times with your car before your front wing pops off and you develop terminal understeer.  A little wireframe indicator on the bottom left of your screen changes color from green to red as you slowly beat the snot out of your carbon fiber wing.  It does serve to encourage you not to win by rear-ending your opponents, while at the same time keeping you out of a high frustration zone because the AI takes off your wings in the first turn of a race.   One of the biggest problems with these titles is that delicate balance between realism and fantasy.  If the AI is going to be pathetic, you better not punish the user too much for the bad AI.  Similarly if the damage model is realistic, you better make good AI.  Also, you don't want the user spinning out so much just trying to drive a lap, or falling depressingly far behind the rest of the pack.  The game's 3 difficutly levels seem well balanced for this.  I can win races on medium, but the hard level is still too tough for me.   The game's modes are fairly simple.  There are time trial, season, single race and challenge modes, as well as split screen multiplayer.  The challenge modes are varying distance races at different sets of tracks, eventually adding pit stops.   That brings up another feature.  Instead of randomly assigning pit stop times, you can use a triple-click golf-swing style control to try to get a faster stop.  You put more pressure on your crew by holding the gas down as the bar fills.  Then as it drops you try to stop it in the sweet spot in the center.  The better you do, the faster your stop.  This all happens during the auto-drive down pit lane.   The setup options for your car are limited to downforce, tire type, overall gearing, transmission (auto/manual) and suspension stiffness.  For this game, that's all that's needed.  Some tweaking can help out if you generally know what kind of surface you're on.  But you don't need a degree in mechanical engineering to use it.   It really is hard to believe that this game sells for $30.  I feel at this point like I got away with theft.  For many games I review, even those to whom I give good ratings, I am often relieved to finish the review so I don't feel compelled to play the title anymore.  Not this one.  My biggest problem here was STOPPING playing long enough to write this review.  As someone who likes a great driving feel, great graphics and sound, and a really immersive racing title, Grand Prix Challenge fits the bill.  If you are at all interested in a well-executed licensed F1 title that shows what the PS2 can actually do with the license, get this game.   This is now the best PS2 F1 title, indeed the best console F1 title, I've played, and EA's coders have some serious work to do in order to beat it.The race driver wannabe in me is very happy to give this one a ~Thumbs Up.~ It's not a full blown sim, but definitely more than typical arcade fare, this one should appeal to those who, like me, have been disappointed in recent F1 titles. It's unquestionably the best F1 console game on the PlayStation 2. In fact, I'll go one step further: It's the best F1 console game ever.", "date": "Mar 27, 2003"}
