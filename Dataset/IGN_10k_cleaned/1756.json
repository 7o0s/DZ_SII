I mean, I'm used to the crappy ~Extreme~ series from Head Games, but with the coming of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 late last year, we're actually getting some good alternative sports games on the PC.  So when Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX floated into our office a few weeks ago, I was eager to take my turn at flying high into the air on 12 pounds of metal and rubber.  I mean, Tony Hawk is the man when it comes to skateboarding, and his game rocks, so you would assume that Dave Mirra, the king of high-flying BMX stunts, would have his name attached to only the best of the best BMX game.  Unfortunately, my theory didn't hold up.   I know what some of you are saying, ~You haven't even gotten into the review yet and you're already slamming the game for not being as good as Tony Hawk.~  Well, the controls and gameplay are so similar it's impossible not to compare Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.  The biggest difference between the two is that Dave Mirra rides a bike while Tony Hawk employs a skateboard...oh yeah, and Tony Hawk is a really, really good game.  You'll find all of the familiar game modes in Freestyle BMX -- Freeride, Session, and Proquest.  They don't really offer much different in terms of gameplay variety though, and the Proquest mode is where you'll do most of your riding -- completing challenges, pulling sick tricks, and unlocking special features in the game. You'll start your career in Dave Mirra's own backyard and progress through 12 levels, some based on real-life locations, including the world-famous Woodward complex in Pennsylvania and the Vail Trails in Greenville, NC. Level design itself is pretty solid, albeit lifeless, and offers a lot of new trick possibilities as you figure out how to link grinds, jumps, and manuals together in certain spots, but the overall feel of Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX just comes across as clunky, slow, and bland.   One thing that twitch-heavy games like Freestyle BMX rely on is constant action and graceful movement.  Freestyle BMX just lacks the sense of speed that makes Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 so fluid and fun, and it's this major downfall that ultimately turns what could have been a really fun game into a pitifully mediocre title.  Invariably you'll encounter the same slow down and dropped frames that plagued the Dreacast and PlayStation versions of the game, even when you're traveling down a ramp or falling out of the sky after catching big air. It's actually more fun to go back and watch the replay of what you did because it runs so much smoother than when you're actually controlling the game.    While I was generally impressed with the tight control system, which is almost identical to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 in both responsiveness and design, I had a real bitch of a time trying to set up any customized controls.  I could input my desired buttons fine, but after I customized my controls, I couldn't get any of the computers I played the game on to recognize them.  I could only use the D-pad, none of the buttons would work for me.  And even if I reset the controls to their defaults, I was still relegated to only being able to move left, right, or forward.  No jumping, no tricks, no manuals...no nothing.  This happened to me on no less than four machines -- every one I tried the game on.  Don't get me wrong, I was generally happy with the default controls, but if you offer a user-defined control system, shouldn't you at least test extensively to make sure it works properly?    The physics model is wonky as well, and sometimes you'll perform such ~wacky~ stunts as falling off your earth-bound bike onto the top of a house or peddling straight up a wall.  Sure, trucking up the side of a house is cool and all, but it's not very realistic.  This did set me up for some pretty crazy tricks, though.  There's also the sporadic ~teleporting bike~ problem in which your BMX magically attaches itself onto a nearby object that's five feet away in order to complete a wall tap, nose pick, or the like.  Collision detection is equally as unpredictable, as occasionally just getting close to -- not hitting -- an obstruction causes you to bail.   The poor graphic quality makes it obvious that Freestyle BMX is a nearly direct conversion of its Dreamcast cousin.  After seeing the plain textures, blurry text, and lifeless environments, Vincent was screaming those two evil words that all PC gamers cringe at: ~Console port!!!  Console port!!!~  The characters are varied enough so you can tell a difference between the various riders -- which include Ryan Nyquist, Troy McMurray, Mike Laird, Chad Kagy, Tim Mirra, Kenan Harkin, Shaun Butler, Leigh Ramsdell, Joey Garcia, and Dave Mirra himself -- but all of the models look plain, simple, and severely jagged, and the much-hyped skeletal animation system turns out to add little to the experience save a few good laughs.  The skeletal animation system was a good idea in theory...just like Communism.  Unfortunately, things are a bit different in practice, as the designers seemed to have forgotten a muscle animation system.  When you bail during a flubbed trick, your body sputters, shudders, and vibrates as you slide along the ground in a horrific dance macabre that resembles a wet rag doll with epilepsy.  Sure, it's good for chuckles, but it looks ridiculous to say the least.  With the exception of the occasional chain rattle and skid, sound effects are pretty much non-existent in Freestyle BMX.  What the audio portion of the title does have going for it though is a kick-ass complement of bands including Cypress Hill, Deftones, Sublime, Primer 55, Social Distortion, Rancid, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphys, 59 Times the Pain, and Swinin' Utters...should I go on?  Acclaim really got the music license right, and the music tracks really put you into the high-energy, adrenalin pumping feeling you should get while playing Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Unfortunately, the game just doesn't quite live up to the soundtrack.    Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX had the potential to ramp off the half-pipe and catch massive air, but instead bails into the pool of mediocrity and grinds to a halt.  It can be an entertaining game in short bursts, but it lacks in comparison with other games in the same genre, and it just lacks the momentum and fluidity to make it shine.  All I could think when I was playing this game was, ~Man I wish I was playing Tony Hawk right now.~  I can overlook the lack of sound effects, I can overlook the poor graphics, I can overlook the customizable controls bug, and I can overlook the lack of multiplay -- but I can't overlook the most important ingredient: graceful and smooth motion.  Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX just doesn't live up to its older cousin Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and when you can get Tony for less than 30 bucks, who would want Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX?  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
