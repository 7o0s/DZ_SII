It's their right and their duty to do things in their own, distinctive way. Well, firstly that's perhaps giving a little too much blind credit to the mysteries of the East - lately, FF games have kept themselves aloft more from sky-high budgets than from faultless design. Secondly, when a Final Fantasy game borrows quite as much, and quite as blatantly, as this one does from Star Wars, that most Western of all fantasies, surely all bets are off.   The charming sky buccaneer's tall, furry alien co-pilot might happen to have a heaving bosom and be clad in fetish gear, but she's quite obviously still Chewbacca. There's also a rebellion against a corrupt empire, a feisty princess in need of rescue from a spaceship, an angry green alien crimelord hunting down the sky pirate for an unpaid debt, presumed-dead old heroes reappearing to aid a new saviour, and even spooky baddies in voice-distorting helmets. There's no two ways about it: this is Star Wars, but mercifully without C-3PO. Of course, Star Wars itself ripped off any number of myths, Westerns and Japanese movies, but FFXII even borrows some of its visual tics. For goodness sakes' there's even a Lando character in there.    No matter how much it's copied from George Lucas' book of bedtime stories, this is the best Final Fantasy in quite some time - since the hallowed VII, in fact. Though the underlying, unmistakable formula remains fundamentally the same, it's grown up quite a bit. Strange that it should pick the twilight years of the Playstation 2 to do it, but it certainly atones for the stilted, bloated sins of FFX (XI, incidentally, was the MMO version, which did do things very differently but never really felt part of the series).   Its major progress is allowing its player a little more choice. Traditionally, the 3D Final Fantasies have been a mostly straight line you're forced along, fighting, purchasing and gaining skills only when the game allows you to do so. The story was all, and what buttons you pressed were only a means of getting to the next cut-scene. FFXII realises the journey is as important as the destination, so combat and skills have been given a major overhaul - not a revolutionary one, but certainly a modernising one. While previously, combat was triggered not by engaging visible foes but by random interruptions from hitherto-invisible enemies ATTACKING OUT OF THIN AIR, an archaic system that outstayed its welcome, now it's more logical. See a bad guy, get close enough to him and he's going to fight you.   In dungeon areas (well-disguised as anything from jails to spaceships), clearly you'll need to get into a barney with pretty much everything you see. In the downtime between plot-forwarding missions though, FFXII becomes an MMO. Only without other people bellowing 'OMFG LOL GHEY' over chat channels constantly. There's an open-plain structure, upon which monsters intermittently appear. They'll attack if you get close, but you can circumvent them easily if you like. Most likely though, you'll want to attack them, as they'll drop loot, which you can then sell for better gear for your party. Basically, it's grinding, and the influence of those Korean MMOs that involve killing the same things over and over again is clear.    It's a fairly bland implementation of the model as it goes, but because it's just an extra element rather than core to the game, it works. Most pertinently, more than any other element of FFXII, it offers you genuine choice (between storyline chapters, at least) of where to go and what to do. There are optional sub-quests to hunt specific uber-monsters, while chaining together multiple kills of the same type of beastie will yield better rewards. In the dungeons, you go where you're told and are stuck there until the game has the good grace to place a save point. Outside, you're your own man (and rag-tag collection of comrades).   Combat in any case is much improved for a bold change away from the age-old turn-based system. Again, MMOs have had an effect - fighting is in theory in real-time, but each action is on a timer. Any attack, from standard thump-with-sword to rain-the-very-heavens-down-on-their-heads, takes a few seconds to kick-off, so underneath the quick-fire action and greater fluidity, it holds close similarity to the turn-based combat of yore.   In any fight, a grid of coloured lines shows who's doing what to who, but in practice it looks too busy and the fight's over too quickly for it to be of any genuine use. If you've set up your party correctly, you shouldn't need the lines anyway - the fight should play out exactly as you planned it. This is thanks to the new Gambit system, which we've mixed feelings about. Setting up preconfigured reactions for each party member (for instance, Vaan will heal any comrade whose health drops below 30%, while Balthier will automatically attack whatever the leader does) certainly takes away a lot of the hard work, repetition and endless menu-fiddling traditional to FF fighting. It becomes more of an action game, and gives autonomy to what formerly were mindless puppets in need of a master.     On the other hand, set up enough Gambits and you won't need to do much of anything in most fights. The option to intervene and perform a specific action is there, but so long as your party's suitably levelled up and with decent gear, most fights are over so quickly that there's simply no need to. It makes for a faster, smoother game, but does mean a whole lot of cool spells and abilities will often go entirely unused, and even that all you'll need to do in many fights is dole out emergency potions. The fact that Gambits must be bought, rather than simply being available for you to customise your fight-style as you like, also re-introduces some of the artificiality that the otherwise more natural combat had shooed away. Nevertheless, it's a change for the good, but if you don't like it you can go entirely without Gambits. It'll make the game about three times longer and harder, but hey, your call.   Developing your party's skills is similarly loosened up. Mage-girl doesn't have to be mage-girl if you don't want her to, while big-sword-guy can also be really good at healing if you so choose. New licenses (skills with a funny name) are earned by spending points accrued for each kill, rather than being bound to what level you're at. Each character has access to the same grid of Licenses, so it's entirely up to you which ones they buy. They could all turn out the same if you want, though a balanced party will always perform better. It's not quite as flexible as it sounds, though - you might have chosen Dark Magic 6 as soon as you could, but the corresponding spells won't be available for purchase from vendors for another 10 hours of play.    And that's because of the storyline, the essence of any Final Fantasy game, but also its greatest hindrance. As well-told as it may be, it restricts the game so that certain items, places and people are only available when it allows them to be. Obviously, it'd upset the game dynamic entirely if you can get the best sword there is early on, but some restrictions are so clumsy and rigid that frustration can't be helped at times. Does it really, honestly matter if we fly back to Rabanastre right now? Will being able to run around a low-level area we've already visited just because the game wants to push us onwards really upset something? Why, then, is there an immovable guy stood in front of the flight desk, purely to stop us talking to the ticket-seller? Our party's defeated building-sized monsters, is in the middle of bringing down a global empire, but they can't politely ask a guy to budge over a few inches? There's a certain immaturity to it - these kinds of artificial restrictions have been in Final Fantasy games (and pretty much any other JRPG) since the year dot, but in this newly-fluid, more liberated game, they feel like an archaic throwback. If they have to be there, at least come up with better narrative reasons for it.   Similarly, there's no choice within the story itself. Yes, it really wouldn't be Final Fantasy if you got to pick your own ending or somesuch - the game is there to tell a specific tale, after all. But why not allow conversational options with NPCs or even other party members? It would be a break from FF tradition, but when there's so many others in this game, it's not a crazy idea. But no, it's always siddown, shuddup, watch this.   Worse still is the regular persistence of that age old punishment - long cut-scene, allow you to walk a handful of yards, long cut-scene. This is just a failure of design - yes, the story is paramount, but what end is served by letting the player think he's back in control, then snatch it away again only seconds later? Again, it's the way FF has always been, but the fact that it's finally grown up beyond an aged model in other ways makes continued, arrogant adherence to tried-and-tested in other respects that much more irritating. All that said, FFXII is far, far better at letting the player actually play than the often insultingly long waiting periods of X were.    Its iron grip aside, FFXII's tale is a fine one. After a few games of overblown, sometimes oddly soulless tales, this reclaims, and often exceeds, the genuine heart and easy charm of VII. Not that its lead hero is anything like the tragic figure of Cloud Strife - generic, spiky-haired blonde J-teen Vaan is really just a slightly whiny cipher for you to steer. Most of his supporting cast, though, are much more compelling, largely thanks to surprisingly adept voice-work and a really bravura use of the PS2's hardware to express facial emotion. Occasionally, an actor fails to squeeze something entirely intelligible out of a mangled English sentence that's an awkward fit into the few seconds an originally Japanese line of dialogue allowed.   For the most part though, they're very convincing. Rakish sky pirate Balthier comes across like the foppish Han Solo he's supposed to be, while fallen soldier Basch has the sort of sad-eyed grit of a late Clint Eastwood character. The group's tale is pleasingly direct and mature, far less prone to the spikes of craziness and corniness of former tales, and the towns it's set in feel much more alive than before. There's very much a sense of world, rather than series of linked locations, here. And it's a big, big world - depending on your pace, it takes anywhere from 60 to 100 hours to complete. And that's without uncovering every side-quest and bastard-hard optional beasts for dedicated secret-scourers to battle.So, the grandiose claims that its the best role-playing game on PS2 do ring true. Its a grand, epic, beautiful achievement that has the cojones to build on, not just rely on, what this series has been doing for years. However, the PS2 isnt a platform served by a huge choice of RPGs  most follow this same model, where role-playing is limited to increasing skills by hitting things and going where youre told, rather than ever actually inhabiting a character. FFXII takes giant leaps from an established formula and is without doubt a fantastic game, but as the clear pack leader, it has a duty to push a style thats still set in its ways even further.", "date": "Feb 14, 2007"}
