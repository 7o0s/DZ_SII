{"name": "Squad Assault", "name_review": "Squad Assault: Second Wave", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/01/27/squad-assault-second-wave", "text": "There was a time when wargames and real-time strategy games were obviously different at a glance. One was typically top-down, 2D, and turn-based, while the other was isometric 3D and, well, real-time. Then along came Combat Mission, offering 60-second turns, a 3D environment, and the number-crunching stats that wargaming grognards love like a fat kid loves cake. It wasn't the most beautiful game in the genre, but it was creating a subgenre of its own, and it was fun and challenging, so we didn't mind so much. Squad Assault: Second Wave has done much to advance in the cosmetics department -- in fact, it looks pretty much identical to SA: The West Front, which came out two years ago. In a nutshell, what Second Wave adds is more maps, accessible in the form of a few new campaigns or as individual engagements. You have over 50 maps you can jump into in any order, and you can play them in 15 minute rounds, or take as long as you want. If you don't mind Squad Assault's lack of shininess, then it's a great way to enjoyably kill some time. It's too bad that it doesn't add much more than the last game.     But this is not to say that there isn't a lot of detail on the battlefield. All the units are meticulously rendered for authenticity and animated for liveliness. From reloading a bolt action rifle to wheeling around a tank on uneven terrain, the game knows its stuff. The environments are relatively rudimentary, but you'll immediately appreciate this as a bonus when you need to pull back and survey the entire battlefield at once -- which you'll be doing constantly. Since this is a wargame, you'll be dealing with a much different economy of scale. Those German snipers halfway across the map really can take out your commanding officer, if there's a clear line of sight. Those mortars camped out on the opposite edge will chew up your infantry if they go running into an open field way over yonder. Once you get a handle on the tactics and the strategy, though, like laying down smoke grenades and prioritizing targets, the initial aggravation gives way to a compelling flow that feels more honest and realistic than the RTS gamer is used to.   For those of you who haven't played a Squad Assault game before: this genre diverges from the RTS by removing individual control of units and adding a morale layer, among other things. Instead, you give orders to groups, and they have a certain degree of initiative that's affected by their state of mind. Keep them close to high-ranking officers and other units, and they'll do better. Let a Panzer roll up on their flank and take a couple guys out, and your men in that group will get just a wee bit edgy. They may break and run or freeze up. It's not a huge part of the gameplay, but it is an important consideration. You'll want to treat your units like people if you want to have the best chance of success.     Before you start the battle, though, you typically have the opportunity to select what groups you want to send in. Sometimes you'll be able to send in an extra tank, and other times you'll only have extra infantry. You'll be allotted a certain number of points to spend, and the better units cost more money. Your average tank will cost a whole lot of money, while a sniper can be added in almost as an afterthought. Unfortunately, the pre-selected units don't give you points back if you decide to return them to the pool, and the game doesn't do a good job of telling you how many units you can send in. It's possible to pile up a bunch of small, inexpensive groups and end up with more people than the game will let you control, and the ~Next~ button just grays out when this happens. It's a small but frequent annoyance.   Once you get on the battlefield, you can move your guys around a pre-defined grid before you actually start. You won't be able to teleport a tank behind enemy lines, but you can move your line around like, well, pieces on a game board. You'll also have the option to show enemy units and allow individual initiative (instead of the group ~thinking~ as a whole), if you want to have a quicker, simpler round. As a whole, though, there isn't much to this phase of the game, since the maps almost entirely consist of hedgerow-packed French countryside. The lack of environmental variety tends to make the sheer amount of maps less compelling. You get the impression that you could whip up one of these maps yourself without too much trouble -- and the game comes with a built-in editor. Sure, it's nice to have over 50 engagements to start with. It's just too bad that so many of them feel the same.There isn't much more here than we saw with Squad Assault: The West Front, when it comes right down to it. And with no facelift in the intervening years, it's going to have that much harder of a time appealing to the non-bearded types. They've also done nothing to smooth the introduction to the game mechanics, choosing instead to stick with the ~read along with the printed tutorial in the manual~ deal. It's a bit awkward, since SA isn't the most intuitive strategy game. I had a lot more success with just playing the game and braving the learning curve, which took me an hour or two. If you're really starved for more Squad Assault, then I recommend it. But don't come crying to me if this honeymoon isn't as fresh as the last one.", "date": "Jan 27, 2006"}
