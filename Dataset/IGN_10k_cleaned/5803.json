With the company's dinosaur at the helm, Nintendo produced Yoshi's Island, an official-yet-unofficial sequel to the company's outstanding Super Mario World. The company continued to headline this greenmachine in other successful game designs, including Yoshi Story on the Nintendo 64, and more recently, the love it/hate it Yoshi Touch & Go on the Nintendo DS. But Yoshi Topsy Turvy is such a turn for the worse, pardon the pun; this original Game Boy Advance platformer is a major step backwards in production and presentation from past Yoshi game designs, and even the embedded ~tilt~ technology can't change the fact that this title is a major disappointment.   Yoshi Topsy Turvy isn't really a sequel to previous Yoshi platformers. Instead, it -- like Yoshi Touch & Go, is an original concept spun out of the universe created in Yoshi's Island. Developed by Pinobee and Blinx development studio Artoon, Yoshi Topsy Turvy puts players in a situation where our beloved dinosaur hero, and the entire Yoshi Island, becomes trapped within a giant pop-up book. To get out, the challenge is to complete the task set forth by the different spirit characters that control each page: eating apples, collecting coins, or defeating enemies. Each page has a specific quota to meet which will reward players with a medal if performed at the minimal level. Exceeding the quota will net players a Silver or Gold Medal depending on how far beyond the quota players go, which will also trigger a chance to play a mini-game for an extra life.   Clearly, the concept isn't structured like your usual platformer. More importantly, neither is the way the game controls; embedded in the cartridge is a sensor that recognizes when the system's being tilted to the left or right, and this control function is utilized within the game's levels by altering the ~gravity~ of the situation. By tilting the system, players can conceivably slide or unravel platforms, rock objects back and forth, and enable Yoshi to walk on walls due to the change in gravitational force. In concept, this sounds like a very cool idea. Unfortunately, in action this concept is a dud.   The tilt sensor is nothing like what's included in Wario Ware Twisted; the unit only recognizes three specific system positions of tilt. It's too rigid for its own good, since it boils down to players slowly tilting the system further and further until the tilt's being recognized. It feels too harsh with its digital-like on/off tilt sensing, where it should feel more fluid and natural, much like Kirby's Tilt 'n Tumble did on the Game Boy Color. Yoshi Topsy Turvy is clunky in feel because of the sensor, which is a shame since the game depends entirely on this technology for its gameplay and level design. The harshness of the tilt sensitivity feels almost as if the game should instead be using the L and R buttons for the world-tilt mechanic. After all, Topsy Turvy doesn't even use the shoulder buttons in-game.   But it's not just the tech that makes Topsy Turvy a bland game experience. The levels are segmented into single room parts instead of extensive elaborate constructions as in past Yoshi platforms. This adds to the overall rigidness of the presentation since challenges can literally last only a couple of seconds, leaving players scratching their heads upon completion thinking, ~that's it?~ Sure, some levels are more complex than others, requiring players to perform tasks like rocking buccaneer boats to reach coins, or sliding platforms in such a way that will get Yoshi to higher ledges unharmed.   But then you've got some challenges that are designed in a way that seems like the designers are pulling a fast one on players. Take, for example, a portion of a level that starts with Yoshi freefalling, and if players don't immediately tilt the system left or right, or jump at exactly the right moment, the challenge is over and it's already onto the next portion. You can almost hear the designers laughing, ~haha, you weren't paying attention, aren't we clever?~ The answer? No, no you're not clever. On top of this, Topsy Turvy has some really loose collision detection that causes Yoshi to miss enemies or power-ups while jumping. It's something that's learned over time with the product, but it really does feel like the game could use a serious tuning.   The game's style borrows from both Yoshi's Island and Yoshi Story with its combination of pixel art backgrounds and objects with rendered character sprites. It's a mishmosh of art direction which wouldn't be so bad if the character animation looked as good as either of the two previous Yoshi platformers. Along with the clunky animation are some horridly designed original characters that just don't fit the whole Yoshi style...at all. I suppose that's the whole point, since Yoshi's been whisked away into a whole new universe, but these creatures are frightening when paired up with the ~voice~ given to them during the cutscenes.   Though Nintendo's the one publisher people can depend on for A+++ titles on the Game Boy Advance, even it isn't immune to producing the occasional clunker. Yoshi Topsy Turvy isn't among the ~terrible~ batch of GBA titles, but it's certainly the worst game Nintendo's published for the system. The tilt concept most likely looked great in a design document, but in practice the idea makes everything feel forcefully clunky. The level designs are all over the quality spectrum, from somewhat challenging to ridiculously stupid, and as a whole this portable game is not a worthy follow-up to previous Yoshi-headlined platformers.", "date": "Jun 10, 2005"}
