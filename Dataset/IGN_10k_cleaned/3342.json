You know, the guy who's supposed to drop in with his supercilious accent and proclaim ~Now, see here!  That's just silly!~  That is, after all, the adjective which describes so much of this game, this series, and everything related to it.  Guilty Gear is 100% pure, unadulterated silliness.  With which there is nothing wrong at all.  I don't mind a serious fighter -- I enjoyed Virtua Fighter 4 a great deal, and its grim-faced realism is a substantial part of its appeal.  But there must be balance in all things, and to balance a game like that, you need the occasional dose of underage transvestites beating people up with yo-yos.  The videogames industry is growing bigger every week, month, and year, with more and more mainstream exposure and influences causing it to take itself more and more seriously.  I'd like to thank Arc System Works for reminding us to lighten up a little bit.  Gameplay Once upon a time (well, actually, it was one night in grad school when I was putting off my homework), I conceived a grand unified theory of fighting games.  It argued that there are two basic categories of components to the design of any fighting game: elements of memorization, and elements of improvisation.    Elements of memorization are those aspects of the game that can be mastered beforehand and performed at will, like canned combinations and special move commands.  The fireballs in Street Fighter and the 10-strings in Tekken are both examples of memorization elements.  More ephemeral are elements of improvisation, tactics which have to be adjusted and implemented according to a particular situation.  Virtua Fighter's combination theory has a strong element of improvisation, for example, and the psychological tactics employed in any complex fighting game also belong in this category.  A bad fighter is one that consists entirely of memorization elements, like Mortal Kombat 3.  A good fighter is one that blends memorization and improvisation in balanced measure, like Tekken, VF, Soul Calibur, or the better Street Fighters.  Finally, a fighter that consists of nothing but improvisation may not be, traditionally speaking, good, but it will probably be an awful lot of fun.  The classic example is Family Soft's Asuka 120% Burning Fest series (which I once dubbed ~the fighter for shooter fans~), but Guilty Gear follows a similar path.  Guilty Gear shares Asuka's combo theory, if not necessarily its practice.  In both cases, almost anything can combo into anything else -- Guilty Gear just makes it harder to get into the necessary range.  XX, this latest maybe-sequel, further complicates the matter with some new features designed to make momentum shifts more frequent.  The result is still more than hectic enough, but just a little less...streaky, perhaps, than the original Guilty Gear X.  Anyway, it's harder for Jeremy to stick me in the corners, which has to be some kind of improvement.  New defensive transitions include Dead Angle Attacks (which let you buffer a quick attack out of a guarding state) and Psych Burst, which expends the stock of the new Burst Gauge to knock an opponent away briefly.  These make a nice counterpoint to the game's speedy and lengthy combos, giving a defending player more options and demanding a little more care of an aggressor.  There's also a new attack button, technically speaking, but all it does is provide a separate input for the old Dust Attack launchers, which formerly required a double input from two existing attack buttons.      The addition of four new characters adds even more variety than you'd normally expect -- Zappa and Bridget in particular have very quirky offensive styles.  Bridget has a huge tree of off-beat special attack links stemming from his ability to launch his yo-yos, while Zappa's selection of attacks varies according to the ghostly avatars he summons to assist himself.  Slayer and I-no are more straightforward in comparison, but they still have their own peculiarities.  Slayer has some cool different mobility options, for example, because his dash can teleport him short distances.  Guilty Gear will never replace Namco and Capcom's offerings as the tournament fighter of choice in the states, but the changes to XX's gameplay make it an even better party game, which I think has always been the point (or at any rate, that's the manner in which I have enjoyed it).  It's a little fairer now, a little more balanced, and showoffs can still master all kinds of ridiculous parlor tricks.  There will always be a certain appeal to inviting a friend over and then splattering him with 12-hit air combos.  There are also plenty of extra single-player modes, although the game's absolutely savage CPU difficulty level may prove somewhat daunting.  Arcade, Story, Survival, Mission, and M.O.M. modes all offer slightly different challenges, but one constant remains throughout -- more often than not, the computer is going to beat you like a gong.  Arcade and Story feature brutal concluding bosses, most of which can only be defeated by judicious application of the Instant Kill attacks.  M.O.M. and Survival, roughly similar in structure (M.O.M. adds power-up items a la Dead or Alive) get very hard very quickly, with few health power-ups to extend your streak.  And Mission mode, a selection of specialized challenges similar to Soul Calibur's mission mode, is ridiculous even by Guilty Gear standards.  How would you like to fight an opponent moving at double speed and dealing triple damage while your own health gradually decreases and you can't do damage with anything less than a four-hit combo?  That would be one of the average challenges.  Running down the handicaps in the harder ones would take several lines.  These design choices continue an established theme.  Arc System Works has always enjoyed making its concluding challenges brutally cheap -- XX just takes the trend to a new extreme.  Whether this is a problem generally varies according to whether or not one is trying to overcome one of these obstacles.  Perhaps you can think rationally about it right now, but I'm pretty sure the Mission mode can inspire anger in even the most cool-headed fighter.  These features are icing, though, in no way central to the game's appeal.  If they prove too hard, just play some more versus games.  Unless your friends are Japanese tournament champions, there's no way they'll be meaner than the AI.  Guilty Gear XX, then, is clearly the best game in the series so far, and definitely worth looking forward to as its February release in the states approaches.  Unlike the first PS2 Guilty Gear X, we won't be getting stiffed in comparison to the Japanese releases.  The US version will also have Kliff and Justice, the two characters omitted from that first release, as well as all the galleries of artwork unlocked by completing missions and Story Mode.  Graphics This series continues to define the territory when it comes to 2D graphics, if only because no-one else seems interested in said territory anymore.  Heck, its nearest contemporary competition is on the Neo Geo, until Capcom comes to its collective senses and decides to make another 2D game.  It would be nice if there were just a little bit of competition in the sprite-based arena, so I could come up with something more meaningful to say than ~Wow, it looks really, really good.~  Que sera.  It does look very good, though.  XX is not as much of an improvement over X as the Dreamcast/Naomi title was over its PlayStation predecessor -- much of the animation for the existing characters and backgrounds is the same --  but it's not as if anyone else has raised the bar in the meantime.  The sprites and backgrounds are still as sharply drawn as a well-made animated film, marred only by some aliasing problems when the camera zooms in and out, and there's just a touch of 3D and realtime lighting flash to spruce up the backgrounds and especially powerful attacks.  Progressive scan support creates a downright stunning picture, if you have a television that can take advantage of the feature.      There's something inherently cool about the fact that just about everything in this game was drawn by hand before it was translated into pixels.  Before all the ones and zeroes got involved, someone used a pen and a piece of paper to create all this madness.  The credits reflect this fact, running down lists of key animators and inbetweeners rather than 3D modelers and texture artists.  They could easily be mistaken for the credits to an animated movie, if you happened to walk in during the middle.  And it goes without saying that the people holding those pens have some of the most fertile imaginations in this business.  Not enough games feature the use of yo-yos as weaponry, ditto gigantic scalpels and teal Gretsch hollow-bodies.  The broad design concepts are backed up by meticulous animation, too.  Slayer's animations (as when he lies back on his little animating cloud while blocking an attack) convey the perfect impression of studied vampiric disaffection.  Even the existing characters have gotten a little refreshing, too, thanks to new alternate color sets.  A big thumbs up for Millia's new outfit in white and teal green -- it suits the dark hair very well.  Sound Guilty Gear XX is such a leap over its predecessor in terms of sound quality that I'm not sure what to do with my copy of the old Heavy Rock Tracks album.  XX includes re-arranged and re-performed versions of every track from the first game, on top of a dozen or so new songs, and they are all miles better than what I heard and enjoyed before.  If you want to know what difference a live drummer makes, listen to this stuff.  The soundtrack to XX was performed with live drums, in addition to more complex and layered guitar parts.  The effect is remarkable, lending weight to the bass and depth to the melodies above it.  This well and truly crosses the line from ~entertaining cheese~ to ~quality heavy metal,~ covering a tuneful selection of variations from speedy to bluesy to power-ballad-y to harpsichordy -- yeah, I dig the synthesized harpsichords in ~Writhe in Pain.~  Want to make something of it?  If you don't enjoy metal, of course, ignore all this gushing, but then if you don't enjoy metal, what kind of fun are you?  The voice acting is also quite good, provided by a wide selection of notable Japanese names (plus series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari, who takes a forgivably narcissistic turn as Sol).  There's a certain set that's going to get a real kick out of Takehito Koyasu spewing gibberish and animalistic screams as Eddie, while those with more traditional tastes can enjoy the dulcet tones of Kikuko Inoue as I-No.  I enjoy Guilty Gear XX so much that I wonder whether I'm the appropriate person to review it.  I love its speed, I love its character design, I love its music, I love its general wretched excess in nearly every category.  It's more or less the antithesis of every staid, accepted notion in games these days, with throwback gameplay and visuals straight out of left field, and to someone who sees so much of the same go in and out of the office every day, that's a breath of much-needed fresh air.Prospective buyers must be warned that Guilty Gear can be a bit on the punishing side, especially in the single-player game.  Well, actually, let's be blunt about it -- stuff like Mission Mode plunges headlong into the realm of Cheapness Personified.  But in the versus game, which is where it counts the most, this sequel does improve on what's gone before.  The instant-kill attacks are still there, sure, but it's no trouble at all to ban those from a friendly game.Importers can pick this one up right now, but it couldn't hurt to wait a bit for the American release, coming up on February 4.  Sammy Studios deserves support for taking a chance on an oddball title like this, since no major publisher would go anywhere near it.  And Arc System Works certainly deserves support for making something this silly in the first place.", "date": "Dec 18, 2002"}
