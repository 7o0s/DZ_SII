At one time they were the pinnacle of computer gaming.  Myst was a mainstream mega-hit that utilized Apple's brand new QuickTime technology with the seemingly limitless storage capacity of the CD-ROM for a stunning experience.  The puzzles in the game were difficult, but the game drew so many people in, that players were eager to unlock the secrets of the island no matter what obstacle got in their way.  Fast-Forward to 2002.  The dominating computer game genres are First-Person Shooters, Real Time Strategies, and Simulations.  Other genres once popular like action games and point-and-click games have been relegated to bargain bins or consoles.  The Feeble Files fall into the former.  It's part of the MacPlay value series and contains all the classic point-and-click elements you may or may not miss from games today. Features 16-Bit Stereo Sound Silicon Graphics rendered animation Around 80 Locations to visit more than 6000 voice lines to interact with Dozens of citizens to meet and laugh at Professionally rendered characters Over 20 actors used for recording the soundtrack  Doesn't sound too impressive, right?   The Feeble Files has had a bit of an interesting history.  Adventure soft released this title in the UK a few years ago for PC.  Epic-Interactive released a Mac version in the European market in the summer of 2001, and now Feeble makes his debut on US shores as a pseudo Mac exclusive.  Keeping in mind that this game is at least four years old, I'll try to show some mercy in reviewing it. Meet Feeble, Crop-circle master Feeble is a prototypical green alien with gigantic eyes assigned to burn circles in crop fields on Earth.  While flying back home from his latest mission, rather than take the easy way home, he decides to have fun and fly through an asteroid field.  As soon as he exits the field, however he crashes into an object that looks a lot like a NASA deep space probe.  The probe goes off course and crashes into the office where Feeble works.  This critical event sets an epic adventure into motion.  Once he gets home, we find out that Feeble's world is an oppressive ~utopian~ society reminiscent of George Orwell's novel 1984 or Sega's RPG Phantasy Star II.   Everything is run by The Company, and the company is run by the Omnibrain.  Feeble's character matches his name, as he blindly takes orders and allows his family and friends to walk all over him.  The everyday language uses cold and scientific terms for common things.  For example, everyone calls each other ~citizen~, days are referred to as ~cycles~, and laws are known as ~directives~.  Despite the dark overtones, the world is surprisingly colorful, and the characters are a tad humorous.  Feeble sets out, to explain his accident to his boss, but instead is thrown in prison for ~behavior modification~.  Here he discovers the Freedom Fighters, and things begin to get interesting.  Since The Feeble Files was developed in Europe, virtually all the voices have a British accent.  There are a wide variety of dialects however, from the prim and proper Fibble (Feeble's brother) to the almost hard to understand strong accent of SAM (a sadistic error prone attack droid presumably run with Windows XP).  When I visited the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, I never imagined that aliens would have such accents.  The only western accent I encountered in the game belongs to Delores (that name always makes me think of that episode of Seinfeld), a stereotypical ~tough chick~ that introduces Feeble to the underground rebellion.  The voice acting is very well done though, and makes up for a lot of the games shortcomings.  Graphically, this is an old game, so expectations shouldn't be very high.  During gameplay, it uses static pre-rendered backgrounds that look ok, and the characters are animated pretty well, but then the game gets truly ugly when it presents 3D rendered FMVs at key story points.  The super fat pixels and artifacts were so atrocious on my cinema display, that I started playing on my iBook so it wouldn't look nearly as bad (it didn't help much).  The sound isn't much to write home about either.  It's clear enough to be functional, but it won't make you want to turn your speakers up.  As far as gameplay goes, The Feeble Files is very frustrating.  The puzzles are very difficult and often make little sense.  For example in the beginning of the game, your space-bike is waiting outside for you to jump on for a ride.  When you attempt to climb on it, Feeble complains to you that he can't ride it because he needs a helmet.  Once you find the helmet, and try to ride the bike, Feeble then tells you he needs a Leather Jacket, but there is no leather jacket in site.  The solution involves finding a doll, and placing it in a broken transporter, which makes the doll grow.  Then you remove the jacket from the doll, so you can ride your space bike looking like Fonzy.  All of that is just in the first room.  MacPlay was nice enough to include a solution for when you get stuck, but even with the cheat sheet, I've only managed to get about 2/3 of the way through it (later puzzles are random).  I guess the argument for this is that since point-and-click games have little replay value, making the puzzles super difficult, adds to the time spent on the game, and in turn adds to the game's value.  My gripe with this is that since this game feels more like a comedy than a serious fight against oppression, I don't feel like working this hard just for a laugh.  (Since I have gotten this far, I do plan to eventually finish it.)  Other than the difficulty, the menus, options, and controls are pretty self explanatory.  You have a small wrist computer named Oracle, that stores your inventory, has an in-depth encyclopedia of terms in Feeble's world, keeps a tally of directives that Feeble has broken, and lets you save your game.   During the game, you move your cursor over an object, press your spacebar to decide what action you wish to take with that object and click your mouse to confirm.  To move, you point your cursor at an area, select the walking cursor type, and click your mouse.  To access Oracle, click on the icon at the upper left of the screen.  Everything is pretty straight forward.     The Feeble Files has been an interesting re-introduction to the point-and-click genre.  With a game like this, the payoff lies in the story.  With its Euro-centric characters, and strange combination of a totalitarian society and humor (for example, a lady gets killed by a ~happy bot~ for crying in public),  it keeps me interested just enough to keep playing.  Since this game isn't a graphic powerhouse, it will work just as well on an old G3 or iMac as it does on a newer G4.  At $19.95, it may still be a bit over priced, but it's a decent adventure if the point-and-click games of the past were your favorites.", "date": "Aug 30, 2002"}
