Sure, Nintendo jammed all of our favorites into the spectacular Super Smash Brothers, but a guy like Kirby, still one of the most original characters in the world of videogames, is certainly worthy of a game all his own. IGN64 has already reviewed the Japanese import version of this title known as Hoshi No Kirby, and we're happy to report that the game made it out of Japan intact and in good shape. Now that there's no language barrier to worry about, we were able to get a little more enjoyment out of the Kirby's adventure. You'd be amazed at the features you can find when you can read the menus.  The Story Ripple Star is full of happy smiley rosey-cheeked little fairies. You know they were just asking for it when the evil Dark Matter shows up one day to take the Power Crystal, the source of the fairies' magic. The heroic fairy Ribbon however tries to save the Crystal, but in her efforts to protect it, the darn thing shatters into a zillion pieces that are sprinkled throughout the galaxy. Enter our hero. Kirby has a soft spot for fairies with crystal problems, so, since he literally has nothing better to do, he joins Ribbon's quest to find all of the crystal shards and bring peace to the happy fairy people.   Gameplay Kirby 64 is rated E for Everyone, but it could just as well be rated E for Eleven-Year-Olds. It may be cute and bright and fruity, but this game has more depth and edge to it than you'd think.   This is side scrolling platform gaming at its best. Kirby is in 3D, but the camera and playing environment are limited so that it feels like an old NES title. You will have to run, attack, jump, jump and attack, run and jump and so on, but your main character's abilities in this game are many and varied. Kirby is capable of limited flight and has two gears of running, but this game is all about his copying power. His ability to inhale enemies, swallow them and take on their powers has already established Kirby as the toughest pink S.O.B. in videogames. In Kirby 64 he gets even tougher.   As a mild mannered pink blob, Kirby can inhale any one of the dozens of enemies he encounters. When he does, de can simply spit them at enemies, he can carry them overhead or he can swallow them. But it gets more complicated. When he has them over his head he can just throw them to the left or right, shoot them straight up in the air, or he can use their offensive attacks to his advantage. One of the flying critters, for example, will carry Kirby up into the air when he puts them overhead. If you inhale an enemy that likes to throw bombs, when you hold them up in the air, they'll continue to throw bombs...at your enemies. But when it comes to one of these more powerful enemies, the ones that can throw bombs or shoot electricity at you, you really should make other plans for them.   Swallowing the powerful enemies gives Kirby their powers. The difference in Kirby 64 is that you can combine the powers of two different enemies for an all-new specialized attack. For example, when you swallow a bomb thrower, you'll be able to throw bombs. Nice and simple. However if you spit up the bomb icon and throw it at another powerful enemy, say a rock-type, it'll destroy him and leave a combination rock-bomb power combo icon that Kirby can then scarf down. When he does, he's got an all-new power: Dynamite. Kirby throws a bundle of TNT, you push down on the D-pad to put his protective little yellow helmet on and watch everything get blown to bits.   Getting to know each individual power as well as the various combinations is extremely important. Needless to say, a recurring theme throughout the game is finding the right power combos in the right situations, and believe us, it's a lot more difficult than it sounds. There are dozens of possible combinations since every power can be combined with itself and any other of the other six abilities.    The Powers Available   Stone Cutter Spark Bomb Burn Ice Needle   This is one of the most innovative ideas we've seen in a videogame in a long time. You will inevitably spend the first few hours of Kirby just trying out different combinations. We do recommend that you try to clear some levels first --since all you have to do is just walk to the end-- and forget about collecting the Crystal Shards. This way, you'll come across all of the different creatures that have powers since certain kinds seem to populate certain levels. You can get Burn and Stone from every other creature it seems early on, but Spark, for example, can be pretty hard to find unless you're on the industrial level towards the end of the game. There are a total of 81 different kinds of enemies in the game including bosses, but when you need an Ice and a Spark to get the awesome Refrigerator power, you'll go nuts trying to find them.  Some of the coolest, most useful combinations we've come across include the aforementioned Dynamite (Stone + Bomb) and Refrigerator (Ice + Spark), and the Flaming Sword (Cutter + Burn). The Fridge is especially cool, because you can watch Kirby spit out steaks, cartons of milk etc. as projectiles and kill enemies, but you can also eat those food items to replenish your health. The Flaming Sword is like the one we saw in Super Smash Brothers and competes with the double bladed Darth Maul style lightning blade for most kick ass weapon available.   We've uncovered a few very lame weapon combos as well. We're sure somebody, somewhere worked very hard to come up with them, but in your haste to find cool ones you'll come across these sucky ~attacks~ more often than you'd like. The Curling Puck (Stone + Ice) just makes us angry. Curling is a very marginal sport and turning Kirby into that heavy iron puck with the handle coming out of the top isn't going to satisfy your urge to destroy stuff. The Flaming Ice Cube (Burn + Ice) just makes no sense. Ice cubes don't burn, they melt when exposed to heat. We could almost hear the enemies laughing at us when we tried to attack with this thing. There are few more really upsetting combos, but we'll let you find those on your own.   Kirby is a collection game where finding all of the Crystal Shards is the only way to get the best ending and unlock all of the coolest stuff. You can actually ~finish~ the game by simply running to the end collecting a minimum amount of crystals if you prefer, but there's no fun in that really. The game allows you to go forward or backward at anytime into the beginning of any level that you've been to before to get powers you need and shards you missed. This will be absolutely necessary if you want to finish 100 percent of the game, but it doesn't frustrate us in a Jet Force Gemini, Donkey Kong 64 way. Crystal Shards can be found in solid rock walls that look like they're part of the level, behind color coded (more on that in a minute) structures, in the grasp of evil mini-bosses or bosses and even, though not often enough, floating above the pathway in plain sight.  You'll have to survey the levels of Kirby 64 carefully to find the location of certain crystals. Sometimes a black pedestal is more than just an obstacle, it can be holding a secret if you just know how to unlock it. There may be a yellow and brown checkered wall that looks sorely out of place in a desert-temple looking level. More often than not these peculiarities will hold Shards and it will be in your best interest to pay attention to the different colors of the Power Icons.   All in all the gameplay mechanic is very balanced. Our only complaint is that there is no analog support. Nintendo's philosophy is that Kirby is aimed at younger gamers and therefore the D-Pad is most suitable, but the analog stick works brilliantly with games like Super Smash Bros. At the very least, it would have been nice to have the option of playing with the stick.  Multiplayer  The multiplayer games in Kirby, have absolutely nothing to do with the single-player game. You can unlock tougher difficulties by playing the previous difficulties and for some oxymoronic reason you can also play the multiplayer games by yourself. You get three games: Bumper Crop Bump, 100-Yard Hop and Checkerboard Chase. We recommend that you play all of them and unlock the toughest difficulties of each one as soon as possible if you want a challenge. BCB has you and three other characters trying to catch fruit or gems falling from the sky by moving side to side and getting underneath them with your basket. The only weapon you have is a bump maneuver that will quickly cause you to switch places with the character right next to you. That's it.  100-Yard Hop pits you in a race against your buddies hopping down a straight trail. One button makes you hop two spaces the other button makes you hop one space. You have to figure out when to use which as quickly and accurately as possible. Simple.  Checkerboard Chase puts all of you on a block checkerboard with the ability to move around in any direction and a ground based laser charge attack that destroys the individual blocks of the checkerboard. The object of course is to cause the other players to fall off of the checkerboard while avoiding the same. Basic.  The reality is all of the mini games are moderately fun when playing with any  number of computer controlled players on the toughest difficulty. Checkerboard Chase, however is the most addicting four player game.  Sound Kirby says ~Hiii-III!~ ~Hey!~ and some other unintelligible gibberish and that's it as far as voice in this game and there's no sound to go with the cinemas. The music, however, isn't that bad. It starts of very annoying but then you'll realize that the music is appropriate for each level and when you're in a fruity rainbow land, you're going to get fruity rainbow music. Later on in the game, there are actually some catchy tunes.   The sound effects are nice and subtle but there are some unique ones for each of Kirby's special attacks. We never knew what a curling stone sounded like until Kirby. Too bad it doesn't make that power attack any better.  Graphics Like we said, it's 3D a la Goemon's Great Adventure with a limited perspective so you'll only catch glimpses of Kirby's roundness here and there. The animations however are pretty good, especially with all of the powers Kirby has available to him. Each one is unique and satisfying and looks believable. As believable as a pink blob turning into all kinds of bizarre objects and shapes can be anyway.  You never move fast enough in Kirby 64 to challenge the framerate, so that's one less thing to worry about. The look of all the enemies and the levels themselves are very stylized and as crazy and outrageous as they seem to be, they all come together and make sense somehow in Kirby's world.   Simple. Cartoony. Colorful. ~2 1/2D.~ It's a Kirby game, and it looks exactly as you'd expect it would. Kirby is a clever little game that you'd almost like to think of as a pet. But make no mistake, Kirby is the amusement park prize goldfish of N64 games since most people will be through and done with this game, never to return, fairly quickly. However, it does a good job for what it is. I know the game is intended for younger gamers, but there are two particular puzzles in Kirby that will give most grown people headaches. Kirby 64 serves a good helping of that old-school platforming style, but is ultimately still too short to warrant a purchase for older players, even with all of the power-up and combo abilities. Parents looking for a fun ~safe~ side-scroller for their kids shouldn't look any further. For everyone else, I'd definitely recommend renting this game, not because it's substandard or a niche title, but because most rental programs will give you a few nights of game time and that should be enough to finish Kirby 64.", "date": "Jun 24, 2000"}
