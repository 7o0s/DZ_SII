The latest entry in this field is Independence War 2, a sprawling, heroic, and multilayered space fighting and trading sim. ID2 offers lots and lots of action in a traditional (but highly engaging) space pirate, vengeance oriented context. And while it's loads of fun, ID2 suffers a bit from some distracting design decisions. Fortunately there's plenty satisfaction to be found in spite of the few minor flaws.  You play as Cal Johnston, a gruff-hero-with-a-heart-of-gold-kind-of-guy. Cal's trying to avenge his father, murdered by the capitalistic leader of Maas Industries. For the most part, this is kind of standard fare, but it's handled adequately, if a little predictably. Cal's actually not that strong a personality in the game which, in this case, definitely gives you a chance to insert yourself more into the role. Cal is aided in his quest for vengeance by a group of ex-cons and a computer simulation of a dead war hero who sounds as if he's speaking through a cardboard tube with one end covered up by wax paper.  Starting at the beginning of the game you'll have various missions placed in front of you (rarely more than two at a time) and you'll have to go out and perform before you can move on to future missions. There are some side quests you can take, but they aren't too profitable given the risks you need to take. Most of the missions involve some combat but few of them put you into the middle of gigantic fights. For the most part, this is a good thing. The enemies are very unforgiving and if you get into a big fight, you will most likely die. At least until you've got the hang of things and have upgraded your ship.  Developer Particle Systems makes a lot out of its Newtonian physics system (Newton was a guy who discovered fruit and then came up with the idea of putting it in little cookies). While I'm no physicist, the physics in the game seem pretty solid. It takes just as long to decelerate as it does to accelerate. Turning doesn't necessarily change your thrust line. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it opens up some interesting tactics. A handy flight assist toggle lets the ship automatically compensate for some of these inertial irregularities. I pretty much used the assist feature the whole time (although you'll definitely need it off to pull off a decent circle strafe).  Combat is really awesome. The various weapons can be set to autoaim at any object within your reticle. This makes things a lot easier, especially considering the physics model used here. You won't be lining up shots like in X-Wing but you will get some satisfaction knowing that you at least pointed the ship in the right direction. Your shield and hull strength regenerate over time so it's often a good idea to beat a hasty retreat, heal up and come back in with guns blazing.  I dig the control interface. A simple hat interface lets you access all sorts of options. You navigate through the various navigation, command and system menus all with a single hat switch (which, despite the inclusion of corresponding hot keys, is an absolute necessity for the game). Still, there are some serious problems with the controls. The developers don't include a control configuration utility within the game itself. Instead you've got to edit an .ini file outside of the game. Trying to match up buttons with commands isn't too terribly difficult ultimately, but it's still much more trouble than it's worth. The only other real problem with the interface is the awful targeting system. The closest targets to you are listed at the top. And since this list is updated in real time, the targets are shuffling up and down the list constantly whenever the action heats up. In situations where  you need to keep track of a target or tag a cargo pod for pickup, this can be a real pain in the ass.  The map system is also problematic. On board your home base, you have access to all sorts of data about the history of the universe, weapons systems, and trading. But for some reason, there's no starmap to speak of. And since the starmap you use in your ship is so hard to navigate you can seriously spend two or three minutes looking for your destination. This is supposed to be the future? Jeez, at least Rand McNally includes an index.  Sadly the game doesn't quite deliver on the promise of non-linear play. Rather it gives you the impression that you're in total control of your own destiny while still maintaining a pretty linear mission path. There are some choices to be made in the game -- choices that will have a significant impact on your future -- but overall I still felt like the missions were all lined up and coming at me one at a time. The game branches a bit more later on but it takes a while to get there. In fact, the game requires a pretty significant time investment before it really gets going. The intro alone takes an hour or so -- and while there's plenty of stuff to do in the prelude stages, the game doesn't really pick up the pace until you've been at it for five or six hours. But considering you'll be at the game for days beyond that, the slower pacing at the start may be intentional.  The sometimes slow-nature of the game isn't helped by the economic model. I found the whole economic side of the game to be a little underdeveloped. There are all sorts of trades available and some real production opportunities on board your ship, but it seems like the team didn't commit itself to realizing the potential of this aspect of the game. It's cool to grab cargo pods full of apes and break them down to a molecular level in order to make missiles but it winds up distracting me more than anything else.  In any case, the game will always give you something jaw-dropping to look at. The visuals in the game are absolutely awesome. Ships and stations are wonderfully lit and textured. From a personal standpoint, I found the ship models a little awkward, but they definitely follow a consistent style. Weapon effects and explosions are all fantastic. The little particles that come off of asteroids when you shoot at them are particularly nice. Apart from some angular flight paths (which aren't helped by the in-HUD contrails), the game is nearly perfect from a visual standpoint. There is a sense of scale missing from most of the areas. It seems even when you get close to the planets that they're still fairly small. But there is an excellent sense of terrain -- not in the sense of being able to hide or race around obstacles but you do get a real sense of place. Nebulae, planets, stars and a whole host of other stellar objects keep you oriented to the various   There are options for instant action and multiplayer games, but with all the great single player enjoyment here, there's not really much point in going online. It's fun to mix it up in these impromptu dogfights, but you lose the engaging narrative that ties the single player game together and gives it a point. And given that the combat model isn't fantastically awesome, going with a straight deathmatch and CTF setup isn't enough to keep me interested.  But the single player game is huge and definitely something I'm anxious to finish. While there are some shortsighted design decisions, the whole package is more than worth your time. Just make sure you've got a joystick with a hat. (You can't have mine.)  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
