Timmy: Dr. Science, why has Conspiracy Entertainment decided to release Hidden Invasion, its new 3D action game for PlayStation 2, at the suggested retail price of $29.99?  Aren't most PS2 games still $50 these days?  Dr. Science: Yes, they are, Timmy.  But the publisher decided that the $29.99 price point would be another ~attractive feature.~  Timmy: But, gosh, Dr. Science, doesn't this game have enough attractive features already?  It says here that it's got 'pick up and play' game mechanics and a two-player cooperative mode!  And special moves for each character...high-powered arsenal...detailed 3D environments and really cool boss battles...  Shouldn't that sell just fine at a regular price?  Dr. Science: Well, yes, it would.  Trouble is, Timmy, Hidden Invasion can also boast horrendous automatic camera control, clumsy 3D movement, mindless AI and level scripting, basic, repetitive puzzles, major bugs in its level design, and just about everything else you'd expect from the creators of Soul Fighter.  So it needed another attractive feature to balance those out.  In today's game market, Timmy, it takes something new, something special, something original to stand out from the pack -- or, alternatively, you need to be cheaper than everyone else.  See how it works?  Timmy: Yeah!  Thanks, Dr. Science!  Gameplay Hidden Invasion is a 3D beat-em-up very clearly descended from Soul Fighter, the last project by French development studio Toka.  Visually, it drinks from a different well -- instead of a vaguely Far Eastern fantasy setting, we are now in the vaguely British future, and square-jawed police operatives are doing the beating, rather than martial artists in strange puffy purple pants.  However, the actions required for success are the same -- hit the ~whack~ button until the faceless minions bite the dust, and follow the arrow as it guides you from objective to objective.  Soul Fighter didn't have so many of those -- Hidden Invasion turns up the puzzle quotient while toning down the complexity of combat, lacking as it does its predecessor's more complex combo system.  Here is where trouble begins, however, because the puzzles aren't very interesting, and given that Soul Fighter's combat system failed to compel, making it even simpler is probably not such a good idea.  The two-player mode helps, but if it's not fun for one, playing with a friend just spreads the misery around.  There's just not that much to do here.  I haven't a copy of the NES game to make sure, but I'd lay even odds that Double Dragon had as many or more attack moves and weapons than this game, and more interesting opponents.  The arcade version definitely did, and once you get to something like Battletoads Vs. Double Dragon on the Genesis, it's no contest whatsoever.  The tasks in Hidden Invasion involve the most basic of fetching and carrying.  One sequence included something like five key-fetches in rapid succession.  Why do I need this key?  To unlock the room with the next key.  Which contains nothing except the key after that.  And so on through three more keys.  Going from objective to objective is occasionally directed by an arrow, which spins nonsensically every so often in the best Crazy Taxi tradition.  Progressing from room to room thus causes the camera to swirl about in such vertiginous fashion that even I contemplated a touch of the 3D sickness, which normally never afflicts me.  Imagine Resident Evil: Code Veronica moving at 78 RPM instead of 33 1/3, with added trouble near walls and in corners, where the camera dives in close and occasionally spins around rapidly.  It can't seem to decide whether to be character-focused or scene-focused, and so chooses the worst of both worlds, occasionally leaping to a new location with no warning or transition.  And it goes without saying that you can be shot by enemies that have a clear line of sight on you, but which the camera hides from view.  And finally, I will relate a funny story.  At one point in Hidden Invasion, I walked up to a door, and was informed that it was locked.  I would need one of those keys to pass through.  Thus thwarted, I walked away -- or tried to.  For some reason, an invisible wall had somehow erected itself around the area near the door, and to add to my troubles, a hidden enemy had started shooting me through the door.  Which was still shut and locked.  Only when I pulled out my gun and shot said foe (yes, through the locked and shut door) did the invisible force field disappear.  This is not just a bug, this feels like the confluence of at least three different bugs working together.  The folks at Sony QA must have just thrown up their hands and said ~Ship that sucker.~  Graphics Looks are as per the version we played at E3 a year and a half ago, give or take a couple of new animations and effects.  The background textures are bland and flat, every edge displays noticeable aliasing, and the enemies display a limited variety of model types and animations.  What special effects there are (mainly a nice explosion and blur when you pop off a room-clearing grenade) kick the framerate down enough to essentially pause the game until it's over.  Our heroes have a few more moves than the bad guys, but the animations are still relatively crude, and their models have plenty of rough edges as well.  Sound The effects here are directly out of Central Casting (Sounding?), and very limited in selection.  They also aren't too sensibly coordinated -- it sounds deuced odd to hear the heavy shotgun and rifle effects always mixed with the high, plinky effect of a shot bouncing off the player character's energy shield.  Meanwhile, the background music is so light and generic that it frequently doesn't even register on the conscious ear.Timmy: Dr. Science, can we play another game now?Dr. Science: About damn time, Timmy.", "date": "Aug 6, 2002"}
