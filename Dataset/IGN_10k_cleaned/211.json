Glitzy new technology and high profile games tend to make their predecessors less attractive in many gamer's eyes. In the past, Cyber Speedway was dismissed as a WipeOut clone, with lousy graphics and less control. However, adventurous players will find a deeper, more rewarding game than previous reviewers have discovered.Cyber Speedway plays less like WipeOut than Daytona 2000. Imagine the Daytona Hornet, turned into a hovercraft, then set on a series of futuristic race courses, and you've got this game.In fact, the resemblance between the two is quite marked. They share the same problems, including low resolution and serious drop-in problems. However, they also share the same pluses, including some incredibly fun courses, and a sense of speed that WipeOut can't begin to touch.The course design is clever, masking the draw-in problems without creating awkward course turns. Although all ten tracks are flatter tracks than the roller-coasters WipeOut designers created, they make use of different elevations and terrains to balance out strengths, weaknesses, and driver skill. At no time do the races feel confining, trapping you into unsolvable corners or cul-de-sacs. You can get stopped in this game, but not stuck.Control and configurability are two areas where Cyber Speedway clearly beats WipeOut. The smart but undocumented analog pad control feature offers an unbeatable precision to your vehicle's steering. Without analog support, this game would rate lower. Plus, the addition of maneuvering jets allows you to take high-speed turns without braking, something that WipeOut designers should have thought of. At the same time, it offers more vehicles and the ability to configure their features, which significantly affect your racing strategy.With some good tracks and great control, Cyber Speedway could arguably be superior to WipeOut except for three things. First, the story graphics and the soundtrack are totally pathetic. When Sega chose to Americanize Gran Chaser (the original Japanese title), their choice of badly-drawn cartoon art and trash metal music jar with the slick futuristic look of the race environment.Second, even racing on the advanced courses, players can easily beat opponents until the final two tracks. Often, it feels like you're racing alone.Third, there's a slightly unreal feel to your vehicle. Perhaps it was on purpose, since your cyber racer is a hover car, but it feels like it has no mass. Instead, the only obstacles you face are the track, and your reaction times. This may be a plus for some, but a crock for others.Cyber Speedway is an easy but entertaining racer. If you've got a need for speed, check this one out.", "date": "Dec 1, 1996"}
