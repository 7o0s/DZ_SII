{"name": "Colony Wars: Vengeance", "name_review": "Colony Wars: Vengeance", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/06/colony-wars-vengeance", "text": "Colony Wars Vengeance is the kind of game that the PlayStation was made for, and in many ways is the closest PC-style game on the system. It's big, complex, and yet remains extraordinarily easy to start up and play, at least at first. But it must be said, Colony Wars and Colony Wars Vengeance are what Star Fox 64 should have been, as they are massive space epics with intriguing storyline, great big battles, and a real sense of space. This sequel is a highly refined version of the first, with numerous graphic changes, better gravity effects, a plethora of mission objectives, and a better sense of speed.   But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's get to the basics. There are 19 acts in the game (which equals about 40 levels in all), as well as completely different sets of missions, rather than the single-objective based missions of the first. And depending on how you play and which branches you take, you may see a different ending than your friends, since there are about six different ones.   You can pick from four different ships, each of which are eventually changeable. Shields, weapons, and maneuverability are the three aspects that differentiate the four new crafts, which can be upgraded and customized. Fins, wings, color and icons can be changed to alter your ship.   In Colony Wars Vengeance, the changes are enormous, but yet they're so subtle, it will take a super fan to notice how well they've been implemented. The ships, as aforementioned, have better and more weapons, which fall into two categories, primary and secondary. In some cases, you'll mine asteroids for crystals, while in other cases you must haul cargo, and your craft is prepared with light-sourced high-tech gadgets to perform the necessary tasks. There are 22 weapons in all.   Other changes appear in artificial intelligence and effects of gravity. Enemy forces are smarter than before, and they'll counter attack or avoid you a little better as the game progresses. You'll have to start thinking like a pilot and not just a mash buttons. You also will find that two of the five solar systems are new, while three of the old ones are back again.  Other cool changes that effect the game occur in the gravity department. First, you'll actually get to battle in areas other than space. That's right, baby. You can battle in heavy gravity areas in alien atmospheres that affect the way you  and your enemies move. This adds a whole new dimension to the battles; it's just amazing that it's on PlayStation. The second gravitation effect is spatial anomaly. You may get pulled into an alien sun, or get thrown into a weird orbit because of the various gravitational fields. In either case, you'll need to cope in more clever ways that just hitting the throttle.  Lastly, Colony Wars Vengeance is a single-player game with both dual shock and analog compatibility. Well, if you haven't already guessed, Colony Wars Vengeance is something that will keep me busy for quite awhile. It's like a great book that you can't put down.Graphically, the game is filled with great neons and brilliant light-sourced objects. Colony Wars was a great looking game, and Vengeance keeps it up there as one of the best. I have to say that because the first was so good, it was clearly a difficult task for Psygnosis to make a much better one. But I think the team did it. It's smarter, and has changed in many subtle ways, and it is still one of the best feeling games around. There is nothing like it (except for the first Colony Wars) that makes you feel so much like floating free in space, or jamming around in complete 3D.The biggest problem? The game is incredibly difficult to finish. I haven't finished yet and I don't anyone who has. it's that tough. If you have Colony Wars and liked it, you'll need to play the sequel. If you don't have either, buy Colony Wars Vengeance, it's a masterpiece in videogaming.", "date": "Nov 6, 1998"}
