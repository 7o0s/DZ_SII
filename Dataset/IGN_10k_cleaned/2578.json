The GBA system is such a great outlet for classics to live out a second life...expectations for graphics and gameplay are much lower on the handhelds, and you don't have to jump through hoops to enjoy a quick retrogaming session on the portable systems, either...it's just a quick plug, play, and put away. Konami's been around the videogame circuit long enough to have a boatload of arcade titles under its belt, and the company has released its first compilation of classics for the Game Boy Advance. Not only are these six games near-perfect to their original counterparts, the development team went the extra distance to offer a little extra something for each one of these classic ports. Features Six classic arcade games Hidden extras in each game Link cable support (single and multi-cartridge modes) Only for Game Boy Advance  Arcade Advanced is a pack of six conversions of classic Konami arcade games of the 80s: Frogger, Scramble,  Gyruss, Time Pilot, Yie Ar Kung Fu and Rush'n Attack. These aren't emulated versions...they've been programmed from the ground up specifically for the Game Boy Advance hardware. In most cases, they're spot-on perfect editions of the classic games, using the exact art of the games they're based on. But they're not customizable...you don't have access to the switches of the arcade games, so you cannot adjust the amount of lives or the game's difficulty. And the game doesn't feature battery save to record the high scores for each game...bummer.  Frogger is this pack's Ms. Pac-Man.  Much like Namco's dot-muncher in Namco Museum, most people will buy this pack for Frogger alone because of its pick-up-and-play charm. In this truly classic game, the task is a matter of getting six frogs from the bottom of the screen to the lily pads at the top, crossing a dangerous highway and traversing a flowing river. Get hit by a car, fall into the drink, or touch an alligator or snake, and you lose a life. On the Game Boy Advance, the game is still fantastically simple, and nearly exact in every way, from the gameplay to the simplistic character sprites. But for whatever reason, they changed the composition of the classic Frogger theme to something entirely unrecognizable. The plinky music is still there, but the familiar ~soundtrack~ that's accompanied this game for years is no longer the same.  Two players can hit the streets and river together in a really nifty but simple single-cartridge two system, two-player race using nicely produced, updated graphics...and this graphics mode can be accessed in single-player mode by entering a hidden code.  Scramble should appeal to the Gradius crowd, because this is the game that started the side-scrolling shooter genre for Konami. And on the Game Boy Advance, it looks nearly spot-on from the arcade game of 20 years ago. The only real difference is in screen resolution; the Game Boy Advance game is ~closer~ to the action since the viewable area is cut off on all sides. It's still completely playable, though, with the same classic action: shoot incoming targets, hitting fuel tanks every so often to fill your petrol levels...run out of gas, lose your ship. Like Frogger, Scramble on the Game Boy Advance has a hidden graphics mode that changes the look of the game to something a lot more contemporary. The updated graphics are really slick, with multiple scrolling backgrounds for added depth, as well as the choice of three different ships with different abilities.  Gyruss is a game similar to Namco's Galaga, but with a more Tempest-style perspective...the action puts your ship around the edges of the screen, and you'll have to wipe out waves of enemy ships on your way through the solar system. The game's original charm was its upbeat rendition of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D-Minor, and this music is fully represented on the Game Boy Advance using Factor 5's Musyx audio tool. This game is slightly more advanced than the old-time shooters, but it's still simple fun that'll put you in the ~zone~ shooting and avoiding quickly-moving enemy craft. Gyruss' hidden special mode is its extra Black Hole level that's not found in the arcade game...this extra isn't as elaborate as what's found in Scramble or Frogger, but it does add a little more value to the package. Only a little, though.  Time Pilot is one of my favorites, a damn difficult shooter featuring 360 degrees of action...your ship is always in the middle of the screen, zooming around blasting enemy craft from different time periods. As you blast a certain quota of enemies, you're faced with a ~boss~ ship...blow this guy up and it's time to zap to the next time period. Again, the GBA version looks and sounds almost exactly like the classic arcade game, though the artwork had to be reduced slightly to fit on the smaller GBA screen. Time Pilot features a single-cartridge, two system, two-player game mode, but the two players don't interact with each other...they're on two independent screens, competing for the top score. It's an okay, but unimaginative addition to the gameplay. The other extra is a new time period specific to the GBA version...but you'll need to enter a code to access it.  Yie Ar Kung Fu is one of the first fighting games ever created...and the Game Boy Advance version is a great edition of this classic action title. As the Kung Fu hero, you'll go up against some of the most brutal adversaries around...all you have to do is jump, kick, and punch until they stand no more. This fast-paced fighter is very simplistic, but a lot of fun...and actually adds something that wasn't included in the original design: two players. That's right...just hook up another GBA and you can play two-players in the single-cartridge mode, playing as any one of the lineup of fighters in the game. And there's even a couple new characters in the game as well. Very, very cool.  And then we have Rush'n Attack, a version of the arcade side-scrolling action with you in the role of a POW soldier breaking out of Russia. The game is pretty deep for the era it was released in, and is the most advanced game of the six in this pack...not to mention challenging and pretty darn fun, too. Konami even updated the game by including a new two-player mode via the link cable...and only one copy of the cartridge is needed. Konami did an excellent job on Arcade Advanced...they didn't cheap out and quickly port six games to the system. They actually went the extra mile and included extras that gamers will enjoy discovering. The multiplayer modes in four out of the six games are also a welcome inclusion, because you don't need a second copy of the cartridge to enjoy them. Of course, there's no loadtimes if you actually have a second cartridge installed in the second system...but with the single cartridge multiplayer, it invites anyone with a system to join in on the fun. Other development teams put to the task of creating classic ports should look to what Konami's development team did with Arcade Advanced. They've set a great example for retropacks on the GBA.", "date": "Mar 26, 2002"}
