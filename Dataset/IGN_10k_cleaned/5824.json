The new pack, available as a free download for Fileplanet subscribers, was produced by the gang at Ubisoft's Casablanca studio. It includes a short new campaign, some retooled classic missions, a handful of new weapons and plenty of new multiplayer modes.  Not surprisingly, Iron Wrath's new seven-mission campaign focuses on capping tangos and rescuing hostages. In this case, the context for all the action is the capture of a variety of scientists who are being held in a variety of training camps, dockyards and fancy houses. One mission requires you to disarm explosives at a nuclear storage facility but the rest of the missions are pretty standard in terms of your objectives -- in other words, just kill anyone you see holding a gun.  Happily, there's enough variety in Iron Wrath to keep you interested. The range of levels in the campaign is broad enough to make each set of firefights seem unique. You'll find yourself fighting through different locations in Eastern Europe, from seaside docks to sprawling military bases. In terms of overall concept, there's nothing here that you haven't seen in the previous games but with Rainbow Six levels, more of the same isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The gang at Ubisoft Casablanca did a really good job with the game's cutscenes, so good in fact, that I'm disappointed that there are so few of them. The intro really set the mood of the game, and the mid-campaign scene of a UAV flyover that shows your team racing to the insertion point puts the rest of the mission into context. The ending cutscene was a little disappointing, but that's only because no one's being shot at.  In addition to the new missions of the campaign, the expansion pack also includes three redone missions from previous versions of the game. My favorite is the Little Wing mission from Eagle Watch. Fans of the series will remember this as the mission that has you rescuing the crew of a Russian space shuttle on the launch pad. The Cold Thunder nighttime jungle mission from the original Rainbow Six and the Urban Ops mission, Iron Comet which has you rescuing a UN envoy in the streets of Istanbul. The content of the missions is entirely the same but they look quite a bit better with today's hardware. The maps for these classic missions are also available for generated missions as well.   The lasting appeal of Iron Wrath will lie in its new multiplayer modes. The Free Backup mode is basically just a deathmatch mode where each player can have up to three AI teammates fighting alongside them. The Limited Seats mode has the players running prisoners to a safe zone on the other side of the map; if even one is killed, the mission is over. The Virus mode requires one team to upload a disc at a certain terminal. If a player holds the disc too long before passing it off to another player, they'll become visible to all the enemy players on the map. Gas Alert is another interesting mode. Here each player gets a 30-second air supply that must be replenished at a number of terminals scattered across the map.  By far the most interesting of the modes is Intruder. In this case, one team is tasked with destroying three terminals defended by the other team. Here's the twist: one member of the attacking team is dressed in the defending team's uniform (although with a different color helmet). This player is the Intruder and can demolish a terminal in a matter of seconds. Knocking the intruder out of the game becomes a high priority for the defenders.  To help supplement the new game types, there are a bunch of new maps included in the expansion. The basic Mediterranean flavor of Tunisian Ruins and a couple of Moroccan maps contrasts nicely with the more industrial areas like the TV packing plant and the rocket facility.  Fans of the game hardly need me to tell them that adding weapons to the game is like pouring water on a pond. Still, there are six new weapons included in the expansion pack, one for each of the five main weapon groups and one new pistol. Though there's already enough variety in the game's existing weapon list, the new additions are bound to please veteran players. The new automatic 12-guage shotgun is pretty deadly but you'll need to get up close in order for it to work well. The best of the new weapons are the highly accurate Type 89F assault rifle and the reliable UM-100 light machinegun.  Since the expansion pack is being released for free, Ubisoft won't be offering any technical support for the title. So far, the game's run very smoothly and I've only seen one crash. Even though Ubi's not providing support for the title, it may still benefit from the incremental patches for the core game.Well, it's free. That makes it a pretty great deal. Even if you're not a FilePlanet subscriber, a one-month subscription fee to FilePlanet is cheaper than the going rate for most expansion packs sold on the shelves. Outside of the cost issue, the content is pretty solid. You'll find that the classic missions and the new campaign won't last longer than a day, but the new multiplayer options are sure to extend the life of the title quite a bit. We'll have to wait and see whether or not the online community embraces the new modes but they definitely add a new level of interest to the multiplayer experience.", "date": "Jun 15, 2005"}
