Answer: Put up goal posts.  Now that you're in the mood for some football, let's take a look at Madden NFL 2001, the 10,000th installment in EA Sports' venerable sports franchise.  Graphics The graphics are truly stellar and if your PC is up to it, the level of detail is amazing: fields that get worn down as the game progresses, jerseys that get dirty, fog curls out from the player's texture-mapped faces, snow and fog, and all that. The only real downside is the hideous 2D bitmaps of the people hanging around the sidelines. I mean, those are some ugly cheerleaders. I've seen Tal with better-looking women than that. So obviously we're not yet at the point of having a 3D rendered polygonal Mike Ditka running up and down the sidelines turning red and throwing his headphones at us, but we're getting a lot closer. A lot closer. It's kind of exciting, but it's kind of scary too.  Just as nice but much more useful is the option to have red and yellow lines drawn across the field to indicate the line of scrimmage and the first down marker, just like they do on TV, although they've spared us the animated Terry Bradshaws flying around. An even niftier option (and one that you should only use in a scrimmage or ~for fun~ game, not in franchise mode, or you're a big fat cheater) is the one that actually diagrams every player's routes and responsibilities in big blue and red arrows all over the field.  One thing they overdo is having crowds thin out as a game progresses. Football tickets are expensive as hell! People don't leave that early, that easily! Well, except in L.A., if L.A. had a football team.  The Longest Yard The knock against Madden has always been that it's too easy to go for the long ball and too hard to establish a realistic running game, to which you can add this: on defense you're better off sticking as nosetackle or MLB, though that's true of most football games. I mean, it's kind of hard to have a cornerback simulator when the d-backs can't be seen on the line of scrimmage.  Obviously EA figures all the kids want to do is dress up like Kurt Warner and throw the damn Hail Mary anyway, so why bother programming in a hard-nosed running game? So guess what happened? They didn't. Granted, it actually feels a little easier to run this year, provided you stick to your sweeps and tosses, and the passing get a bit dicey when you're using sub-par players, but overall it plays a lot like last year's. You can use sliders to try to compensate for your strengths and weaknesses, but that also messes up the AI, who plays the game a lot differently (erratically? Randomly? With both eyes shut, calling plays with a Tarot deck like Mike Ditka?) than you do.  But once you get into the swing of things, the game plays very well. Audibles and hot routes are easily handled, and having a defense read and react to what the offense is doing is a lot closer to the real game than being bound by a formation. The playmaker is a little lacking (why can't you practice a play while designing it?) with only preset routes, which makes it harder to create your own offenses.  Most frustrating to me, and perhaps I'm all alone in this (as I am with my infamous ~someone could make a lot of money on a superhero game~ stance) because I didn't seen anyone else griping about it on any of the Madden message boards -- and believe me, there's plenty of griping on Madden message boards -- but the most frustrating part of the game was the infernal kick meter. Maybe it's something freaky with my computer, or maybe it's Mike Ditka again, but my kick meter almost always freezes for several seconds, then shoot ways the hell up, leaving a quarter second window of opportunity to get off a reasonable kick -- and by reasonable I mean 70% of the power bar or so. Now I'm no joystick jockey, and I realize kicking isn't the most glamorous part of the game, but see how far you get if every punt is a ten yard squibble and every extra point is kicked right back at your center's pixilated butt.  Franchise Player Ever since Sierra took its excellent Front Page Sports Football Pro game outside and shot it like a sick dog, I've been jonesing for a real football game, one that actually includes the strategy and management part of pro football along with the flashier and more fan-friendly stuff they show on TV. You know, the fun stuff like re-negotiating contracts and squeezing a third-string flanker under the salary cap. You have to break in that new Voodoo card somehow.  And while Madden has had franchise mode for a few seasons, this is the first year that it hasn't been so cluttered with unusable menus and crippled by glaring omissions and a paucity of options that I'm actually considering playing a custom career league after this review is done. Now that may sound like faint praise, but from my point of view, what I'm say is that I actually maybe sort of just possibly found a semi-decent replacement for FPS: Pro, and that's saying a lot. But drafts, trades, salaries, retirements, career mode, it's all there.  Franchise mode is missing quite a few options though: you can't import or design new team logos, can't move franchises from city to city, you can't design stadiums -- I'll be darned if my custom league is going to have any of Satan's Astroturf in it -- and forget about hand tailoring a schedule or picking what teams go in what division; nor are there any simmed box scores and highlights to look at, etc., etc.) but it isn't too bad, really, and has a lot of cool stuff like the uniform maker and even a few things (like the salary cap) that I don't think FPS Pro ever had. And of course it would be silly to say that contract negotiations here are ~protracted~ or ~difficult,~ or that the salary cap is ~realistic.~ I mean let's face it, outside a handful of NFL gnomes known as ~capologists~, no one knows how the hell the salary cap works anyway.  X's and O's X's and O's? What do you mean? This is the part of the review where I talk about the truly riveting stuff, like the menus and the interface.  Real important, huh? Well, yes! For once, some fancy pants artist hasn't put the buttons in inaccessible corners under a goofy looking squiggle, just because it looked cool! Actually, they did do that here and there, but it's not as bad as past Maddens have been. It's almost navigable this year, kind of like IGN.  I also have real issues with the manual: besides being way too short, it constantly refers to the ~green~ and ~yellow~ buttons of those Gravis gamepads when quite clearly my Sidewinder pad is a thing of monochrome aesthetic glory. Issues man, you gotta deal with them.  There are plenty more issues to deal with too. League-wide injuries and transactions aren't neatly summarized on a single screen. I don't think the rosters are very accurate either (though an update is coming and player editing is very easy), and while I could be wrong, I think Mike Ditka was hiding in a closet in my front office, secretly giving away draft picks in bad trades. How he did this I don't know, since the other teams never offer trades on their own initiative, something the one guy who programmed Baseball Mogul managed to include.  Speaking of the draft, you're able to pool all the current players and kick off a new year with a league-wide draft, or you can plug away at franchise mode and have a real rookie draft at the end of each season. Nice touch, though whoever designed the player-sorting screens for the draft managed to hide the critical data pretty well. Maybe they were just trying to keep you on your toes though, since the draft now has an actual clock counting down each round, complete with a tick-tick-tick sound in the background. Artificial tension! Can you pick through our baffling menus to find a useful undrafted player while the clock wind downs?! Do the Madden Draft Spreadsheet Hustle!  And then there are also a couple of serious bugs, like the stupid one where the team that's won three games is higher in the standings than the team that's won four games. Now I'm not privy to what kind of complex C++ John Carmack giant head genius numbering system they're using here, but in the real world, four is greater than three. And that little bug looms a lot larger when it sends the wrong frickin' team into the playoffs. Wildcard team, indeed.  Gotta Get Online I'd be lying if I said I explored Madden's online play to its fullest, because just typing that sentence made me feel dirty. Actually Madden's got a very robust (dirty feeling again) multi-player franchise league thingy going, but if I were to report the results of a full season of play you'd have to wait many more weeks for this review, and I don't think that's what Tal intended.  On the flip side, finding someone in one of the EA lobbies to play against couldn't be easier; I wish I could say the same about somebody sporting to play with, someone who won't drop out because they're down 21 to nothing in the first quarter. Too many quitters out there.  The Power and the Glory The audio on the field is crisp if not bone-crunchingly so (yes, I'm trying to get my English teachers rolling around in their graves), although the commentary, as we've all come to expect in the Madden Franchise, is a humorously repetitive affair: Pat Summerall wearily states the obvious with as much enthusiasm as Strom Thurmond at a Gay Pride parade, while our virtual John Madden, after several years of storage on the EA Sports' hard drives, has lost a few bytes and slipped into full-blown senility, mindlessly repeating the same phrases over and over. Some additions I'd like to see added to Madden's repertoire next year can be previewed here.  And for God's sake, what is that crappy music? There's only one kind of music that should ever be associated with professional football in America, and that's the NFL Films soundtrack (I apologize for the low-fidelity RealBadAudio of that link). Somebody should license stuff that and put it in a game next year, 'cuz I guarantee you review scores will increase by 10% simply by the unconscious association of that music with greatness in the minds of critics and audience alike.   And while you're at it, bring back all the features of Front Page Sports Football.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Sep 1, 2000"}
