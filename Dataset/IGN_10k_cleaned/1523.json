Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX ended up being a Tony Hawk clone on BMX cycles when it hit the PlayStation this fall -- and many of the same elements have been shrunk down for play on the Game Boy Color version of the Acclaim series. While the game has a ton to like, the one thing that really brings it down is the overall sensation of being disconnected from your on-screen player.  Features Eight different environments 20 BMX tricks Password save Only for Game Boy Color  No game has completely emulated the 3D gameplay of Tony Hawk in the Game Boy Color's restrictive 2D hardware, but designers are getting closer and closer to accomplishing it -- and Dave Mirra is one of the closest yet on the handheld. Not only do you get eight free-roaming environments, jumps, quarter-pipes, and, yes, even halfpipes, but you get the same gameplay structure that gives Tony Hawk its edge -- the level quotas. In each level, you have to perform specific tricks, collect items, and earn enough points that'll gain medals to unlock parks and upgrade your bikes. Tricks are pulled off by a combination of D-pad and button pushes, and some tricks can only be performed if their hidden tokens have been acquired in specific locations in each of the parks.  To give the sense of 3D on the Game Boy Color, Dave Mirra utilizes the same perspective offered in MTV Sports: Skatboarding (slightly overhead, at an angle) which, in my opinion, is the real way of doing this type of game. It's all about the freedom of movement, and it's also about being able to hit different heights, and this is really only possible in a game that takes depth into account in its game engine. This perspective also allows the level designers to position multi-directional jumps and multi-tiered platforms all over the place, which gives the game a lot of variety in the tricks and combos you can pull off. And what's very cool is the instant replay mode -- at the end of a run, you can watch the run in its entirety. If you perform all three tasks in the designated time, you'll earn an extra bonus -- a replay of the game designer's record run for that level.  The graphics are another plus in Dave Mirra, as each level has been constructed with nicely designed jumps, tables, and rails...and in later levels, you can even enter a few empty pools for tricks. The team did a great job in the level layout, and the character animations are well done, too -- each spin, hop, and grind have been fluidly animated, despite some jerkiness due to the fact that your bike can only move in eight different directions. Dave Mirra offers a multiplayer tournament competition, but it's not link-play so don't get suckered when you read about the four-player mode on the back of the box. The game also falls victim to the horrendously long password syndrome since Acclaim didn't want to flip the bill for a battery save.  The one major downside, and what brings the game down, is the control. It honestly doesn't feel like you're in direct control of your on-screen character -- it's a seriously high learning curve to actually pull off multiple combos in one shot. It all boils down to sloppy control tweaking -- maneuvering your character and performing stunts never feels natural or intuitive. It may have something to do with the fact that a bicycle is a lot bulkier than a skateboard -- but I doubt it. If the controls of MTV Sports: Skateboarding were combined with the tricks and combos of Dave Mirra BMX, then we'd have a winner on our hands.  I really wanted to love Dave Mirra, simply because it's doing a lot of things right  loads of stunts, tons of parks, and a variety of level quotas to complete. The controls are the game's weak point, as it's hard to love a game that requires so much struggling to master. I like the game, but the love just isn't there.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
