You've dented the hood of your father's Hyundai attempting to be a Duke boy.  You've tried on shorts that test the limits of current indecent exposure laws. You've dreamt of bringing felons to justice a la Rosco P. Coltrane. Perhaps since first gazing upon the wonder that was the Dukes of Hazzard in 1979, you've lived in that crazy Georgia county in your mind -- scaring your loved ones, jeopardizing your job, calling your sanity into question.   Or not. But I'll be willing to bet that if you witnessed the glory that is the Dukes of Hazzard television series, you've stolen a moment or two to imagine a life of moonshine-enhanced whimsy, high-speed car chases and the General Lee. Now's your chance. Southpeak Interactive gives you the opportunity to live your dreams in a rip-roarin' new racing adventure.   Gameplay A racing adventure?  Kind of.  There's a lot more racing than adventure here. In the one-player game, you lead the Duke boys into carburetor combat against the finest engines in the South in a series of nine episodes. The main goal is to bust up some criminal activity in Hazzard and win enough money to pay off the mortgage to Uncle Jesse's farm, but the missions range from pulling over bad guys to winning races to collecting objects. The multiplayer game is almost exclusively racing, except for a horrendously useless demolition derby style Jug Run.   The missions involve burning through the Georgia back roads, and vary little in purpose.  Usually you're either racing to get somewhere in a specific amount of time, or racing to beat an adversary or flat-out racing on the track at the county fair.  If you're not doing that, you're pulling someone over by ramming them or using Luke to shoot arrows into their tires (one of the cooler features in the game).   The control is nothing imaginative. Maneuvering around hairpin turns, launching over ramps and dodging law enforcement is what makes this game interesting, and in more difficult modes, downright challenging.  But at times, car speeds get going so fast, initially it seems like anything you touch will send you into a 720-degree spin or a flip. The seriously wacky stunt-car physics make for a weird hybrid driving-action experience. The materials for the game boast that this is ~just like the TV show,~ but at times while playing this game, I felt as if I'd been transported to the last fifteen minutes of the Blues Brothers.  Cars spin, ramp, careen and tip. You'll find yourself doing end-over-end rolls and aerial twists and then landing back on your wheels.  While this doesn't make for the most realistic car chase experience, it fulfills its purpose: you really do feel as if you've been transported into the insane world of Hazzard. Things don't necessarily don't make sense, but they don't have to (and didn't always make sense in the show, either).   Truthfully, anything less than the Hard mode is a cakewalk for an experienced gamer, but that's why it's there. Some missions, in fact, can't even be completed if you make even one subtle error. If you simply want to see the story unfold, Easy mode will give you the guided tour in a couple of hours.  In the long run, though, what fun is that?   The two-player games give this title a little more extended playability, especially since this is the only racing game where you can pit the General Lee against Rosco's Cruiser.  The race mode enables you and a good ol' boy or gal to compete on any of the tracks.  The Time Trial game is simply a hand-the-controller-back-and-forth deal as you compete against the clock. Yawn. The Jug Run is a complete waste of time, as the split screen makes it almost impossible to maneuver through the junkyard environment.   For total fans, all of the significant characters from the Dukes series are here: Luke, Bo, Daisy, Cooter and Uncle Jesse; J.D. ~Boss~ Hogg, Rosco and Enos.  Your old friends from the series appear in the cut scenes and occasionally in the game itself.  You'll hear helpful hints over the CB from your Hazzard compadres, but for the most part, it's just Bo and Luke side-by-side.   The Balladeer, wonderfully voiced by Waylon Jennings, sets up the scenes, and you knock 'em down.  You begin the game in control of the General Lee, and, as things progress, get to climb aboard Daisy's Jeep, Cooter's tow truck, Boss Hogg's ride, and Uncle Jesse's classic hotrod.  The inclusion of all the vehicles is a nice touch, and there are slight differences in handling, but it's not real road racing. It's funkified arcade racing at best. (Anyone weaned on Gran Turismo will be sorely disappointed.)   Graphics The Dukes of Hazzard is a fast game and, for the most part, the graphics keep up with the cars. The General Lee looks good zipping around on the back roads of Hazzard, as do the rest of the vehicles.  The backgrounds are functional, but nothing special.  They do get rather repetitive by the end of the game, as several of the scenes take place in the same locations.   Where the graphics both shine and fail are in the cutscenes. For some reason, Southpeak decided it would be a grand idea to render the Dukes opening credits sequence for the startup movie. I guess this is to give the game continuity. But wouldn't video have been nice? The characters look downright goofy.  Uncle Jesse resembles Dr. Zaius from Planet of the Apes and Luke Duke could easily be on display at your local zoo. Probably, the biggest disappointment is Daisy. She's is an aberration. The only character that looks fairly accurate is Rosco -- even his mannerisms are captured accurately. Conversely, the cars and environments in the cutscenes are beautifully rendered. The orange General gleams in the Georgia sun, the water and trees look great.  It looks like Hazzard! 'Nuff said.   Sound The purr of the General Lee, the wailing of sirens, the rumble of Cooter's tow truck -- where were they?  I seem to remember the General sounding like a souped-up Dodge, not a piece of Formula One Eurotrash.  In fact, there wasn't enough variation in any of the engine sounds to make me feel as if I were in a different ride.  Thankfully, they included the Dixie horn, but after a few toots, even that becomes an empty pleasure.   Waylon Jennings' narration is what really makes this game feel like a genuine Dukes' experience.  Across the board, the voice acting lends authenticity: James Best (Rosco), Sonny Shroyer (Enos), Ben Jones (Cooter) and Tom Wopat (Luke) all pitch in with vocal cameos.  And the inclusion of the original Dukes theme was key.  The original songs by the Tractors are light and fun, which is perfect for this sort of romp, but they eventually melt into obscurity.  Like I said at the start, this ~racing adventure~ is a lot of racing and a little adventure. The game plays out like an episode, and for those old enough to be nostalgic, it offers a hearty dose of Duke lore. Of course, the real appeal is to get behind the wheel of the General Lee once and for all.  The title succeeds in capturing the look and feel of the television series, but for those unfamiliar, it will probably be a waste of time. The missions can get tedious, even though some are truly challenging. The stunt physics are fun and the various vehicles are a hoot. All in all, it is a decent ride while it lasts, which will vary in proportion to how much you enjoyed the TV show.", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
