In fact, this makes the adventures of Kratos seem like they were penned by a feminist pacifist. Yet, despite the over-the-top decapitations, buckets of blood and boobies, Conan is undoubtedly a fun hack-and-slash game that quickly gorges its own violent niche, without ever attempting to justify its extreme existence.   She's one of the few fully-clothed women in the game.  As it happens, the tone of the entire game is pretty much established within the first few minutes of the opening level. Your adventure starts with Conan busting into an ancient tomb on a hunt for treasure. Unfortunately, the hidden bounty is actually the body of a powerful, evil magician. After beating Conan to a bloody pulp, the wizard steals the barbarian's magic armour and uses it to create a range of hideous bosses. Obviously, our long-haired hero isn't too chuffed, so he sets out to slay the monsters and reclaim his armour, saving a few naked maidens along the way.   That's all the plot Conan needs to kick off his violent killing spree and, unsurprisingly, it's a very combat-heavy action game with the odd puzzle thrown in here and there to keep things fresh. Thankfully then, combat is one of the game's plus points, with Conan able to pull off beat-'em-up-style combos using strong, quick and grab attacks. At first, scraps do seem absurdly simple, with only a string of quick attacks needed to take down foes. However, as you spend experience points on increasing Conan's roster of available moves, the difficulty of opponents also increases. This means you need to be creative when heading into the heaving throng - elevating a potential button masher into something that's both challenging and enjoyable.   Even surrounded by enemies, the combat still works well.  For instance, alongside usual blade slashing, Conan can pull off counter attacks by blocking enemy strikes as they're about to hit. That's not all though: you've then a limited time to press one of the attack buttons, which initiates a gloriously over-the-top instant kill - slicing limbs off, decapitating a foe or even ripping their beating heart from their chest. It's stupid and totally derivative but, because instant kills are both genuinely handy during scraps and quite tricky to pull off in the heat of battle, they add some much-appreciated depth to combat, alleviating them above mere gore-filled flourishes.     Then there's the fact you can pick up weapons from fallen opponents, enabling Conan to perform different combat moves depending upon the size of the blade - small, medium or huge, double-handed affairs. This means there's plenty of room to perfect your own preferred style of combat. If you like to attack in quick flurries, you go for the smaller weapons, while lumbering powerhouses can opt for the slower but more powerful big swords. It's another added element that ensures combat doesn't just become a repetitive button-mashing slog.   Enemies get more elaborate as you progress. Here's a big monkey-man thing.  Things move up another notch during boss encounters. Here, there's an undeniable nod toward Kratos, with epic boss fights split into distinct sections across entire levels. For example, one scrap sees Conan slaying a large sand dragon. Here, you weaken the dragon by slicing it with your blade before interacting with nearby environmental objects to eventually skewer the monster on a massive stone blade. Although this treads fairly familiar territory if you've played God of War, Conan's boss battles are no less imaginative for it, offering a definite test of combat skills and mental dexterity. All good stuff, then.   However, things aren't so successful when it comes to the game's puzzles - a term we use extremely loosely. You see, whereas the boss fights and combat generally offer a pleasing amount of depth, puzzles wallow in the deepest pits of mediocrity. By and large, things never get more taxing than smashing a fake wall down with a big rock, slashing at a chain with your sword then pulling it by hammering the face buttons or setting fire to a bush with a flaming stick - all of which are repeated ad nauseum. That said, we guess its fitting that the barbarian's adventures are more about brawn than brains anyway.   Boss fights like this the highlight of the game. Even if they are quite tough.  On the subject of lacklustre elements, it's worth pointing out that Conan doesn't exactly inspire from a visual standpoint. Although developer Nihilistic Software previously stated it wanted to evoke the art style of Frank Frazetta's Conan paintings, the end result here is a collection of drab-looking environments and samey enemies. What's more, the game employs an irritating fixed camera that often makes it tricky to see where you're going, occassionally keeping marauding enemies hidden from view. Equally irritating, the fixed camera also makes it hard to judge jumps during the title's handful of, admittedly rather simple, platforming sections. None of these ever reach game-breaking heights but they're frustrating all the same.Although they say you should never judge a book by its cover, in the case of Conan you can. The box art features a gruff, six-pack-toting barbarian wielding two bloody swords, surrounded by half naked nubile women. All that's missing is a decapitated head at his feet and it would be perfect. Ultimately, Conan is a game that revels in the ridiculous and its all the more fun because of it. There are plenty of tongue-in-cheek moments, ludicrous cartoon violence and a rather suspect plot. Thankfully, the in-depth combat system, while not as tight as God of War's offering - is strong enough to carry you through your adventure. Throw in some great boss battles and an array of over-the-top weapons and you've a compelling package. Admittedly, Conans violent charms certainly wont be to everyones tastes but, if youre looking for a brainless but enjoyable romp, you could do far worse than pick up this.", "date": "Oct 4, 2007"}
