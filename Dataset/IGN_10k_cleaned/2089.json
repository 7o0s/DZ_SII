{"name": "Lightweight Ninja", "name_review": "Lightweight Ninja", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/29/lightweight-ninja", "text": "Long gone are the days when the 2D platformer dominated shelf space and sales charts like Oprah over all comers at the Sizzler. There was a time though, when sub par copies of hand drawn games would come and go soiling the days of the NES, SNES, and Genesis, and even spreading their taint into the then ~next-generation~ realms of the 3DO and Saturn. Thankfully, the progenitors from which these clones spawned were memorable to say the least. Favorites include Mario to Metroid, Contra to Gunstar Heroes, and Altered Beast to any other piece of crap.   With the advent of the 32-bit age, like all things, the days of the hand-drawn 2D platformer began to come to an end. Paving way for a new progeny, children birthed into the genres of RTS and FPS, the 2D platformer sunk down deep into the bowels of the industry, leaving only the occasional 2D fighter and 2.5D platformer as reminders to days of past. Low and behold, all is not Quake and Dune in the land of the PC... Lightweight Ninja, the story of one born, bred, and brainwashed ninja boy named Ty, is the latest attempt at a retro revival. Too bad, like the entire decade of the seventies before it, Lightweight Ninja is too much funk (the bad kind) and not enough groove (the good kind) to warrant a stylish revival (yes, that sound you here is everyone laughing at and not with you and your disco kicks and bellbottom bums).   As mentioned, you control Ty, a small corporate engineered and bred pawn who's been brainwashed and appropriately ~ninjafied.~ Your boss Elliot Xavier, head of X Industries, has crafted you to fighting perfection (so far as you can run, jump and throw acorns) and now you're off on your first mission: destroy Sentetsu, owner of a whole lot of robotic mops and a supposed bane on the existence of the world. Too bad ninja boy didn't learn much schoolin' as he pretty much believes whatever the hell anyone tells him right off the bat. See, it seems old Elliot is up to no good, and now it's up to you to turn the tables. All this fighting and ninja stuff is pretty much all Ty is good for, because he is afterall a midget looking thing with a foot hand. Though I'm sure not intentionally done, his hands look remarkably like most people's feet, or more accurately the feet of a monkey due to some, at times, awkward art.   The game's episodic in nature, and this particular iteration is broken down into three chapters each broken down even further into three levels. Chapters are began by a text-based slide show that drives the story and outlines the upcoming mission (if you've ever played any game before the Playstation than this will be more than familiar to you). While not the best of implementations, it is a noteworthy nod, being very much in keeping with the general feel and presentation of the game, despite its at times cheesy dialog, ~You can call me C Diddy beautiful.~ Progess can be saved at anytime via save slots, which can be overwritten an infinite number of time, and general progress is kept by way of a checkpoint in each level.    Very much the old school platformer, Lightweight Ninja's gameplay grants the vertically challenged monkey-foot-hand-boy the ability to run, jump, slide, downward stomp, and throw acorns (and other crap) at ridiculously slow speeds. Sadly, all of these play mechanics are hampered by debilitating design and implementation flaws that cause the game to barely drag itself along like a bloated Mafioso pulling a corpse after a spaghetti and lasagna all-nighter.  Let me give you the ultimate Lightweight Ninja hint book... First key to gameplay: Avoid everything. Second key to gameplay: When you eventually hit just about every single thing you're trying to avoid (which you undoubtedly will) try and minimize your display of giddy insanity as it will confuse and frighten those around you. Hit everything? Wha? Yes indeed, the collision detection has been crafted by the devil himself, or more specifically, one of his one-eyed trolls that dwells somewhere around the plots reserved for the Facts of Life cast. Think that apple tossing squirrel is going to miss? Wrong! It'll clip you even if your character doesn't even touch it. The only way to then play the game is to either A.) Run through the levels and straight through anything regardless of whether you get hit or not, (an entirely feasible approach on easy, though not recommended on hard), or B.) Slow the gameplay to a crawl as you methodically and meticulously approach every enemy with your utmost concentration and resolve, something that's just not appropriate considering the responsive and fast paced control of the main character.   The latter, although more boring, is still the preferred method of play as the game unfortunately consists of one poorly and unfairly placed enemy encounter after the other. Run straight down the screen and attempt to react to anything with instinct and reflex alone and you'll surely get hit. Enemies lurk above ladders just out of sight, dropping crap on you at perfectly inopportune moments catching you on your way up, and floor bound baddies will hide in the midst of the foreground art invisible until you walk right over them.   This wouldn't be a problem, provided Ty were equipped with mandatory ninja skills, of which he has none. In fact, all he can do for defense is haphazardly lob junk (at first acorns because he's a moron and ~dropped~ his ninja stars off a cliff) at enemies (who include the dreaded thorny cat, mad apple lobbing squirrel, and apparently benign office appliances that have the innate ability to cause you damage). Even his downward pounce and slide will inflict damage upon himself if used in an offensive manner. That is what we in the business professionally term weak ass. Well, this wouldn't be so bad if we were talking Ghouls and Ghosts style of lobbing crap at bad guys. Sure, too bad monkey-foot-hand-boy lobs weapons at a ridiculously slow speed that are also plagued by inconsistent and downright aggravating hitdetection (only this time they don't register as opposed to registering too often).  In all fairness, control itself is responsive and quick and general platform jumping and movement are pulled off effortlessly, but again, the implementation of jumping, and enemy avoidance are so awkward and poorly done that any occurrence of joy will be quickly sapped out by cacti that dot the interiors of office buildings and perform excellently at sapping the fun out of the game by causing you damage a gagillion times in a row.   Thankfully all this stumbling around ain't done on the backbone of a loser engine, so it's not a complete loss. Exactly what you'd imagine a 2D side scroller on the PC to look like, Lightweight Ninja, by way of its advanced technology (alpha blending, and on the fly anti-aliasing) features Crisp visuals and fluid animation. It puts to shame its console brethren in terms of clarity and vibrance. It's cartoonish flair is vivid, well defined, and crisp to the truest sense of the word; lines are well defined, areas are well contrasted and colorful, enemies themselves are also well drawn and defined, and each is distinct in appearance and animates very, very smoothly.    The levels themselves are said to be not tile-based, but rather drawn straight from tools such as Photoshop and feature sloping terrain, and varied graphics. Still, they often give off an appearance of interconnected blocks mishmashed together, especially where flat stepping areas meet one another, and emit a general air of being poorly thought out. All levels also feature their own horrid static background texture, each easily graduating from the Massachusetts school of assy drawings. Drab, blurred, large, and generally unpleasant looking things, they are certainly no substitute for parallax bliss that even Sonic the Hedgehog was pulling off years and years ago.  In terms of sound, Lightweight Ninja is brimming with appropriate ninja esque music, sadly marred by annoying beeping sounds that occur upon collecting virtually any type of item. Get an acorn? Bling! Get a diamond? Bling! Get the game thrown against the wall and stepped on repeatedly? Bling!  Lasting appeal? Not even seeing yourself ranked as one trillionth in an online ranking system that basically lists your points against other online denizen's can prevent its inevitable trip to the dog's chew toy bin after only a single play through (still, props for trying). Extension will come in the form of further episodic releases, but judging this game as this game, it's hardly worth playing again. Besides you can beat it in one sit down if you try.   As a whole, Lightweight Ninja is indeed pretty lightweight. Admittedly sleek graphically, and rich in style and premise, it's sloppy design flaws, limited play mechanics, and lack of substance bring it down considerably. Check out the free first chapter, and if playing through two more chapters of the same vein interests you then the first episode can be yours for only 20 bucks; however, I wouldn't rush into a purchase anytime soon unless you really, really need the platforming fix, in which case I'd still recommend staying away from good old monkey-foot-hand-boy.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
