And now Gameloft's new stab at sports gaming, Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005, proves that perhaps there is no genre that Gameloft cannot tackle -- and succeed at.   Features:   Quick Play, Tournament, and Versus Play  Battle Singh for golf supremacy  18 holes   Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005 is not Gameloft's first attempt at the sport. The firm previously attempted an afternoon on the links with the limbless wonder, Rayman. And honestly, despite being a couple years behind the curve of today's games, Rayman Golf was a better golf game than Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005. Not that Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005 doesn't give it the old college try.   Everything for a great golf game seems to be in place from the on-set. The game features a full course of 18 well-plotted holes, a rock-solid celeb endorsement, and plentiful play modes.   When you start up the game, you can get right into the action with Quick Play and slip into the golf shoes of Vijay Singh. You can only move on to the next hole by coming in at, or beating, par. The next mode is a tournament where you square off against the full 18 with one of four different pre-programmed golfers. Each golfer has different strengths and weakness, such as power and putting. Finally, Versus Mode either drops you into stroke play or match play against Singh.   The 18 holes of Harbor Town are well designed. The difficulty ramps up with each progressive hole. At first, you get a nice par 4 to fire the ball across the fairway. But as you get further into the course, pars go down, wind speeds kick up, and the hazards become more plentiful. The learning curve is seemingly very player-friendly.   The game looks pretty good, too. The in-game golfers are nicely drawn sprites with decent animation. The courses are vibrant and alive, complete with water hazards and sand traps. You can switch between a full map view to plot your shots or use a 3D view with the camera firmly behind your golfer and watch the stroke. The on-screen information, such as wind and club selection, is presented cleanly.   Control is the make-or-break factor in golf games. Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005 provides an excellent control scheme for making serious shots. Swings are taken through the usual system of meters. When you line up your shot -- which is far easier to do on the full-screen map than on the 3D screen with the tiny map in the corner -- you start to fill up a power meter. When you are at the appropriate level of oomph, you tap the button and the meter descends to the accuracy meter. Depending on how close you are to the center of the meter, you may hook or slice the ball.   We tested Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005 on a Nokia 6600 and found the sensitivity of the meters quite good. The meters stop precisely when you hit the action key, so if you can get your timing done right, you can hit one great shot after another. Master the meter system, as well as how to properly factor in the wind, and you'll be under par every step of the way.Vijay Singh Pro Golf 2005 is an excellent golf game for your handset -- a real contender when pitted up against EA/Digital bridges' upcoming Tiger Woods golfer. I wish there were more courses with just a little more variety, but still enjoyed my afternoon on the links with the Big V.", "date": "Dec 1, 2004"}
