Thanks to Gameloft's Chessmaster for handsets, now go-go gamers can indulge their inner Bobby Fischer -- but for their phone's sake, hopefully they can keep the bad boy behavior in check.   Features:   Official chess rules  Replay classic matches  Quiz Mode tests your skill with the pieces   There is a variety of punishing things human beings put themselves through for seemingly little reason. Picking up a girl at a bar on Sunset Blvd. Drinking grain alcohol. Pledging to a fraternity. And playing chess against a computer. If you think you're a window licker already, try playing a Chessmaster game. Unless you're something of a minor pro, this game will make you feel real dumb, real fast.   However, don't give up. That's just tough love. Stick with it, because if there is one standout feature to Chessmaster, it's that you will soon find yourself getting better. It will be in very slight increments, but you'll notice you start doing trickier things with your knights, are figuring out better way to use your pawns than cannon fodder.

You have endless chances to retry these contests, and if you choose to surrender, the game mercifully shows you how it's done. Pay attention. You never know when one of these tactics may help in actual play. The Classic Games Mode allows you to recreate some of the biggest matches in chess history -- can you alter the course of the game?   Naturally, chess looks like chess. But the Chessmaster interface is clean and easy to use. And there are several different chess sets you can use in the game, so if you prefer a different set of pieces to liven things up -- get after it in the options screen.Chessmaster is an extremely well done game of chess, not just for cellphones, but for any system it appears on. However, Gameloft's port of the classic chess sim is an absolutely superlative product that will be enjoyed for week after week by fans of the mental contest. And if you're not a fan, but interested in becoming a better player, Chessmaster is an excellent place to start.
