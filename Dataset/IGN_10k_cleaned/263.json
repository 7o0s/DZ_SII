It was a staple on the Genesis back in the early 90s, flowed onto the N64 soon after, and made its way to the PC where it's been the top selling computerized hockey franchise since its inception.  So it comes as no surprise that EA Sports has continued its license with NHL 2000 this year, the follow-up to last year's stellar offering.  So, how does this year's update stack up against its predecessors?  Just read on and find out.  Gameplay stays pretty true to '99, with only a few tweaks and changes.  One of the biggest differences between last year's installment and NHL 2000 is that gamers can no longer opt to play a shortened game.  Now all games consist of three 20 minute periods.  However, EA does give you an option to speed up the game play, so you can play an entire 20 minute period in five or ten minutes.  Thoroughly confused yet?  Well, you should be.  While this allows for more accurate state comparison between teams, it really takes away from the game for those arcade players who enjoy the thrill of playing a quick game of NHL.  The entire NHL series has always been more of an action-oriented hockey game than a true-to-life stat-based simulation, so this new feature is good for some, bad for others.  Especially since, at its heart, NHL 2000 still plays like an advanced arcade game and not a hardcore sim.  The AI this year has been toned down quite a bit, at least in terms of difficulty.  Although this year's AI is a mixed bag, with the defense totally ignoring you on some plays and, at other times, crushing your jaw into the ice every time you make a move.  One feature that's a welcome addition to this year's offering is the  individual expertise slider bars for goalies and the rest of the team so you can adjust the computer AI to suit your play style.  This makes it easier for beginners to pick up the game as well as making the game more challenging to you veterans out there.  Even though I still found the game to be extremely easy, and the 'skate behind the goal and shoot the puck in the corner' trick still works giving you about a 60% shot accuracy, which is much higher than in real hockey.  And, while it's nice to see that EA has improved the one-timer shots, they too are much easier to land than in an actual hockey game.  Again, this is a feature that's both good and bad, this time favoring the arcade player over the sim enthusiast.  So, what else is new in this year's update?  Well there's an expanded draft mode where you can pick against the computer AI GMs.  While I'm not very impressed with some of the computer's picks, this is a nice feature that lets you build the team you always wanted to see ... well at least if you can do the right bargaining.  There's also a greatly enhanced career mode in this year's offering, allowing you to go through the entire draft and trading process and build an entire team from the ground up, seeing how they progress over time.  Over the course of a ten-year period, new players will become available for recruitment while many of the veteran players will become free agents after their contracts are complete.  On the visual side of things, NHL 2000 is still one of the best looking sports games out there.  Sure, the graphics are only slightly better than '99, but the game looked good then and it still looks nice now.  It's obvious that the art team paid special attention to eliminating polygon overlap and clipping problems.  Like '99, all of the players look like their real life counterparts, and EA has added improved facial expressions and lip movements to the 2000 version, and I swear sometimes you can see the players move their lips and say things that wouldn't be allowed on Prime Time TV.  The little touches like dynamic reflections and sparkling ice sprays when a player makes a quick turn really add to the realism of the title.  You can even look forward to better wobbling animations when players take a hard check into the boards in this year's edition.  Of course, like '99, all of this graphical punch requires a powerful machine, and you'll notice marked performance drops on slower machines.  To insure smooth playability, I'd recommend playing NHL 2000 on a 300+ Mhz machine with a fast 3D accelerator and at least 64MB of RAM.   One of the most touted and notable graphic improvements in this year's version is the ability to import your face and map it onto a player so your visage can be in the game.  As cool as this feature sounds, it just doesn't work very well, and the imported faces look little like their real-life counterparts.  I was so excited to make an entire team based on the freaks here at the IGN offices.  I started with the most freakish of all, those creatures from IGN64: Matt and Aaron.  Take a look at the screenshots below and you'll see what I mean.  Where is Matt's listless, wearied look?  Where's Aaron's charming smile and elongated head?  The face import feature just made them look like crazed psychos released from the loony bin.  OK, so maybe they did get one thing right with the face importer.   If there's one thing that NHL 2000 does perfectly it's sound.  I was incredibly impressed with last year's color commentary by Darryl Reaugh and Jim Hughston, and ESPN's very own Bill Clement does a great job of keeping the tradition alive.  The play-by-play action is as smooth as the ice the players skate on, and it's rare to hear the same phrase repeated twice.  This combined with excellent sound effects and some big musical licenses like Garbage make NHL 2000 one hefty aural experience.  On the multiplayer side of things, while LAN play was extremely stable and satisfying, Internet play was  laggy and riddled with bugs. There are a lot of problems with Internet play right now, like lock-ups and dropped games, and the last time I checked their were only about 20 people online.  The EA team is working on the problem, though, and we'll hopefully be seeing a fix in the first patch.  As good as the game is, it's not that much different than NHL '99.  Of course, the '99 version was one of my favorite sports games ever, so there's not much to complain about here.  The AI isn't as challenging but, like every year, EA has added a few new features to keep gamers coming back for more.  However, this year's offering wasn't a major upgrade like the '99 edition.  While I don't think 2000 offers enough improvement over '99 to warrant a full purchase if you already own last year's installment (unless you absolutely freak for hockey and just have to get the new rosters), it's certainly worth the $40 sticker price if you're new to PC hockey or missed out on '99.  It's a great game, but the best new feature is the new rosters and the inclusion of the Atlanta Thrasher's expansion team.  Now when's EA going to start offering a $10 downloadable roster upgrade for all of its sport's series?  -- Tal Blevins I'm a huge video hockey fan, having played the NHL series since its original inception on the Genesis nearly 10 years ago. The Game Boy version is a nice try, but the odd quirks on the AI make the game a bit of a pain to play. Thankfully you can turn off the offsides option, but that makes cherrypicking the net a whole lot easier. I just have to wonder, how much better would the game have been if it was programmed specifically for the Game Boy Color?", "date": "Sep 30, 1999"}
