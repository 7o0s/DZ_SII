Its latest arcade game, Radar Scope, was a flop.  It was boring. Derivative. It was sinking NOA's ship - almost literally. It  was 1981, and thousands of Radar Scope upright cabinets were being delivered  by sea, traveling to the then-headquarters of Nintendo's American arm in New  York.  As they made the journey to and through the Panama Canal, the company was in  a quandary. It needed a new game, and it needed it quickly. Its bank  accounts draining, there wasn't enough time to come up with an all-new  product, pack and ship it from Japan. The company would have to use what it had -  thousands of machines of Radar Scope. It'd have to improve the stinker.  A young man named Shigeru Miyamoto had been working at Nintendo in Japan. He  hadn't been there long, and hadn't had much chance yet to show his quality.  He got it with Radar Scope. Called into the office of President Hiroshi  Yamauchi, the young Shigeru was tasked with improving the game. He accepted,  looked at what he had to work with, and promptly threw it out.  Shigeru started from scratch, designing an all-new game that could be  installed as a retrofit on the Radar Scope board. Popeye was his  inspiration, as he sought to create a game starring the spinach-swallowing  sailor saving his sweetheart Olive Oil from the brutish bully Bluto. The  license, though, was unavailable. Nintendo was unproven. Miyamoto changed  his cast - Olive Oil became Pauline, the damsel in distress. Popeye became a  short and squatty hero in a red cap, called Jumpman. And Bluto he changed  into an ape - consulting an English-Japanese dictionary to find the right  way to say ~stubborn monkey,~ he ended up with the name Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong created an all-new genre - the platformer.  Arcades of the day  were filled with space shooters or maze chases, but this game was different.    Here, players ran, climbed, and jumped.  It was a totally fresh  experience, guiding the hero along fractured girders and broken ladders,  jumping over barrels and wielding a giant mallet to eliminate enemies. Some  of the enviroments even had moving parts - elevators and conveyor belts that  added further novelty to the experience.  It was like no game to ever come before, and the rest is history. Though  NOA's employees were skeptical of the game, it installed and modified the  Radar Scope cabinets into Donkey Kong machines and the game became a hit.  Second in popularity only to Pac-Man at its height, Donkey Kong went on to  inspire merchandising, sequels and even a cartoon show. The character  Jumpman was later renamed and is better known today as Mario, a mascot who  has gone on to have some moderate level of success for Nintendo himself.  Donkey Kong was Nintendo's first big hit. It established the company's name  and provided their foundation. It introduced the company's most important mascot  character, without whom it would never have achieved the success and  longevity enjoyed in the ensuing 25 years. And its design still  holds up today.  Playing DK on the VC is a great, nostalgic experience - it  controls well with a Wiimote, Cube or Classic Controller, and you can see  the excellence of Miyamoto's early work shining through in the smallest  details.  There's a lot of fun still to be had with this grand gorilla. And looking  back on the company's history, Donkey Kong is arguably Nintendo's most  important game.  Don't download it.  Don't download it, because this isn't the true Donkey Kong. This Virtual  Console release is of the NES version of the arcade classic, not the arcade  classic itself. Whereas the coin-op original had four full levels of play,  the NES conversion only has three - it's only 75% complete.  And on top of that, the opening cutscene - where DK climbs the first stage  and stomps the girders into place - is removed. The interstitial animations  between stages - removed. The final scene, with Jumpman rescuing Pauline and  DK crashing to the ground below, actually is there. But nothing else. That's  kind of a big deal, since Donkey Kong was the first ever game to contain a  full narrative structure, telling a story with a beginning, middle and end.  Books have been written on this subject, I kid you not.  But Nintendo, for whatever reason, has continued to promote this crippled  port for years. On the NES. On the e-Reader. On the GBA as part of the  Classic NES Series and in Animal Crossing on the GameCube. This is not the  complete Donkey Kong. Not the first masterpiece game that established  Shigeru Miyamoto's career. It's a cut, condensed and compromised conversion,  and its promotion really just needs to stop.The Virtual Console has a lot of potential. It has potential that extends beyond Nintendo's past home consoles. Like Xbox Live Arcade, the Wii's download service should offer classic arcade titles. Nintendo, built on a foundation of arcade hits and only later expanding to the home market, should be encouraged to provide its quarter-collecting catalog alongside the classics from the NES, SNES and N64. The original, true Donkey Kong should be made available. The original Mario Bros., or Sheriff, or even the underwhelming but historically significant Radar Scope. So don't download this version of Donkey Kong. Send a message that you want the real game. The game that saved Nintendo from bankruptcy. The game that kept the company from drowning in thousands of unmarketable arcade cabinets. Give us the real Donkey Kong, Nintendo, not the same old incomplete port.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
