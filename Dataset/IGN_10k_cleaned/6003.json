{"name": "Atari Legends Vol. 1", "name_review": "Atari Legends, Vol. 1", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/09/atari-legends-vol-1", "text": "The idea if getting three games for the price of one is certainly the most appealing thing about Atari Legends, Vol. 1. Retro gaming is still a popular cause celeb in the industry -- recently, both Namco and Tecmo released classic collections on consoles (although, our respective reviews labeled neither worthy of purchase except for the most fervent fans). Mobile is actually the perfect arena for the resurrected titles of yesteryear, thanks to the required screen size and simple control inputs. However, this new collection proves that even the most classic of games, the ones that actually deserve to be mentioned in hallowed tones, can be wickedly undone with slapdash emulation. And that, good reader, is what sinks Atari Legends, Vol. 1.   The three games that compose Atari Legends, Vol. 1 are indeed classics: Asteroids, Centipede, and Combat. Only one of these games is ported with any degree of fun -- and it's the former. Asteroids looks reasonably close to its original counterpart and the controls (thrusting and shooting -- hey now!) are fairly accurate. Centipede also looks the part, but the controls leave much to be desired. Firing is a major chore, as you must lay on it to get the job done. The breaks in firing can be lethal, because the response time to start firing again takes 4-ever. Combat... heh. Well, let's just say that Combat is broken to the core.  If you have any respect for the past, stay away from this collection. Tell Atari you will not support sub-par classic collections like this. Bastardizing Combat does not endear me to look for an inevitable Vol. 2, where I fear a fave like Crystal Castles will be mercilessly ruined. Please, save my darling Bentley from such a fate and spend your download dollars elsewhere.", "date": "Sep 9, 2005"}
