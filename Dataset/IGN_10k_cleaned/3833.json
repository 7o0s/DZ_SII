{"name": "SWAT 2", "name_review": "SWAT 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/12/swat-2", "text": "At first glance, SWAT 2 looks like a pretty bad game. The graphics are dated, the characters on screen are miniscule and indistinct, and the control is clunky and poorly explained. These factors make playing the first few missions almost painful, and while you're still peering intently at the tiny little characters in their little tile-based world, suddenly someone starts shooting, a hostage gets killed, your squad goes down, and before you can say Rodney King, you career in the LAPD is over.   But if you take the time to learn the interface, look past the dated graphics and get into the design of the game itself, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you find. SWAT 2 is a good little strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take command of the SWAT arm of the Los Angeles Police Department. Play is handled in a real-time, squad level tactical simulation, but a variable speed option lets you control action so you're not completely overwhelmed. The SWAT team can perform a variety of actions besides moving and shooting, including peering around corners with mirrors, disabling bombs and booby traps, and cuffing and subduing suspects. Scenarios range from bank robberies and assassinations to full-blown riots, territory rarely explored in computer games (as opposed to wars, for example, which computer games have covered from almost every angle, and then some).  And that's what saves SWAT 2--the subject matter is interesting and handled tastefully, the scenarios are varied and challenging, and the limitations put on a SWAT team--saving the hostages, capturing the bad guys (alive if possible), and keeping your team intact--makes for a refreshing tactical challenge. You also have the option to play as the bad guys, commanding a utopian terrorist group that takes over campus buildings, kidnaps business executives, and fans street protests into student riots.  This said, SWAT 2 has plenty of room for improvement. Besides the interface and graphics, some of the design balance is wrong--tear gas seems way too effective, as you'll rarely miss, and one shot will usually knock a suspect out immediately. On the other hand, sniper rifles are near useless, as snipers can only operate from certain predetermined locations that are not easily found on the map.  The AI could also use a lot of work--both the SWAT teams and the terrorists often fail to react when an opponent runs by. The game is a little short too, with only 15 missions per side, and you can probably finish it in between twenty and thirty hours.  But despite these drawbacks, SWAT 2 is worth a look, particularly later on when it comes down in price. And we certainly would like to see a SWAT 3 if some improvements are made, as this is one of the more interesting squad-based tactical games to come out in a long time.  -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 12, 1998"}
