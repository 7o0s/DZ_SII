We've had the deep blue underwater world of Bioshock, with its mature storyline proving that shooters needn't be mindless blast-fests, devoid of any kind of moral decision making. Then we were spoilt by the piercing orange of The Orange Box, its epilepsy-inducing bright box drawing attention to the fact that we were getting five awesome games jammed in for the price of a single title. Last but definitely not least was the night-vision green of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, arguably the finest virtual representation of the nightmare that today's troops see in the fiercest of battles.    As if those shooters weren't enough to keep our thumbs busy well into the new year, the promising Blacksite: Area 51 has just crash landed in the desert of Nevada. Combining the power of the Unreal Engine 3 with the radiant resume of game designer Harvey Smith (of Deus Ex, System Shock and Thief: Deadly Shadows fame) this game looked destined to be the final golden arch in the 360's multicoloured spectrum. Sadly, within minutes of firing up the game, it became apparent that it isn't so much golden as it is beige. In fact, it's more of a creamy, dull, matte kind of beige, as seen in such exciting places as public bathrooms and shoe closets.    As expected, the UE3 engine provides great character detail. Pity about the environments.  Hmmm, where to begin in this warts and all alien autopsy of uninspired game design. The storyline is as good a place as any. We're pretty sure this is the first time anybody's thought to arm the Iraqi army with alien technology, so it gets a point for originality in that regard (spoilers be damned, if you read this review and then play the game, you deserve to be abducted by the most anally-curious of aliens). But this promising narrative basis is littered with the most two dimensional, lackluster, annoying and forgettable characters you'll see this side of an episode of Joey. The dialogue is laughable, the voice acting even worse... provided you can actually hear it over the muddy audio mix. In an attempt to flesh out the storyline, information files can be found throughout the level, but all they succeed in doing is proving how rubbish the storytellers are.    But a shooter without a decent storyline is like a celebrity without a personality - they can still be pretty good fun to spends some time with, although ultimately you'll end up feeling empty and dirty. Does Blacksite have the good looks and smooth moves to make up for its lack of character? Let's find out.   One of the - very few - cool moments in the game.  If you've been keeping up with the previews of the game, one of its most anticipated features are its squad tactics. You're accompanied on most missions by a couple of gung-ho gits. The fact that all of their actions can be controlled by the right bumper trigger is a dead giveaway as to how simplistic the squad system is. Point your crosshair at a point on the ground, tap RB and your squaddies will move up to that position. There's not much point though, as they're continually following you, so it's really only good for flushing out bad guys.    When there's a trigger point that they need to activate, such as operating a computer or planting C4, a giant floating green icon hovers on screen. Aim your crosshair at it, hit the RB button several times until it actually registers, and they'll complete the action. You'll most often use this mechanism for the difficult task of, unbelievable as it may be, opening doors. Apparently your character struggles with the intricacies of the modern door knob. Yet every now and then certain magic doors opening without any assistance. But back to the squadmates - they can also be used to shoot at baddies, although they're about as accurate as a blind man firing in the dark. And that's as deep as the squad controls get. We've seen puddles on the side of the road with more depth.    There's also supposedly a morale system. According to the back of the box, your AI team mates have moods and emotions - perform well and they'll aim truer, screw up and they're absolute rubbish. Yet thanks to their simplistic AI, they seem to be either crap or crappier. There's no audio or visual feedback that indicates their mood either, other than a couple of words of text on screen. It'd be nice if they screamed in terror when their morale was dropping off, or 'Hoo-ah'-ed their way to victory when things were looking up, but obviously this would have required far too much effort to include in the game.    On to the feature that caused us to drool over so many sexy screenshots of shiny aliens then, Unreal Engine 3. While we can forgive a colour palette that consists only of differing shades of brown (Gears of War, anyone?), it needed to be balanced out by gorgeous level designs, amazing artwork and beautiful props. None of which you'll find here. The levels are more linear than a slide-rule, endlessly filled with dozens of pathetically disguised corridors. Is that a canyon I see before me? Nope, it's just a rocky corridor. Oooh, we're driving down a slipway. Oops, it's just a concretey corridor. Let's clear out this massive base. Damn, it's a series of small rooms connected by dark corridors.    However, things do occasionally look up courtesy of some cool set pieces involving mammoth bosses. These take place in much larger arena style areas, and the sheer size of the creatures makes their relatively simple behaviour easy to ignore. It's these moments that lift the game out of being a total disappointment, and might just inspire you to trudge through the in-between sections, but sadly they're few and far between.   Gears of War this most definitely ain't.  As expected from the Unreal engine, the character models are suitably detailed. They're a little shiny, but most of the alien critters are actually rather cool. Pity that they're all animated with the grace of an ~It's a Small World~ animatronic robot, and there's only a handful of different types. The first person weapon animations don't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as those of Call of Duty 4 (sorry Infinity Ward!) while explosions and bullet strikes have as much oomph as two eight year olds having a pillow fight. Yet somehow the game still manages to drop to a sluggish framerate when things get a little hectic.    I've already mentioned the muddy soundscape, and the piddly gun sound effects and generic spooky music don't help matters in the audio department at all. Oh yeah, did I mention the voice actors all sound like dropouts from acting school?    Other than the cool boss battles and set pieces, the mediocrity extends to nearly every area of the single player game. Driving levels are painful lessons in how not to implement vehicle physics, while an aggravating checkpoint system will have you clearing sections only through the grace of good luck rather than any kind of skill. And why can't my bullets shatter TV screens in this game? (Although the fact they can shred through a little bit of the shelter in the environment is semi-redeeming).    You're far too dumb to open doors, which is the primary purpose of squad mates.  If you thought the multiplayer was going to lift Blacksite's game, think again. Generic, boring, and uninspired are all words that spring to mind. There's one mode that is almost cool, where one player must infect the others, but it's by no means unique to Blacksite. Four or five years ago the multiplayer in Blacksite would have been merely acceptable, but alongside the likes of Halo 3, UT3 and COD4 it'll barely have time to spin up in your drive before you hit the eject button. Blacksite: Area 51 is like an alien autopsy video. The ads and packaging look cool - you can't wait to get home to witness proof of real alien life. But whack that DVD in and within seconds you realise you've been had, as you watch a bunch of students dissect a cheap papier mache fake. Blacksite is just the same - for the last 12 months it was shaping up to be rather tasty, but within minutes of playing you'll realise that you've been taken for a ride.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
