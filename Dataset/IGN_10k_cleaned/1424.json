And while the realistic violence displayed in video games was somewhat an issue, the terrible shootings that occurred in that Colorado high school raised the awareness of violent video games twofold.  Incidentally, this was when Konami Amusement of America decided to release Silent Scope in the arcades.  Yeah, the timing couldn't be worse but somehow, Silent Scope wasn't targeted at all.  Some attribute it to the game's plot where, as part of an elite police force, you save the President's family.  Of course, I'd like to think it was because of its innovative scope feature that forced the player to use two gameplay screens: the large screen to see where are targets are and the monitor in the gun peripheral that acted as a ~virtual scope~ for pinpoint accurate shots.  As one of the best arcade gun games, I had a hard time believing the rumors that Konami was going to port this game to home consoles.  While I didn't doubt that the Dreamcast could easily execute the visual quality, I wondered how they would create the same gameplay feeling that made Silent Scope so unique.  Of course, making a gun peripheral would be out of the question; not only would it be costly, but would be regarded as ~highly politically incorrect~.  Perhaps a specialized VMU unit so the ~virtual scope~ would be seen through the square VMU window of your DC controller?  Nah... too small, and just as costly as having a gun peripheral.  But never did I think of having the zoom feature built INTO the viewing screen, because I thought it was too complicated.  Of course, Konami made this play feature easily and playing with it just as simple.  In short, Silent Scope for the Dreamcast is a definite must buy for Dreamcast fans starving for a good gun game.  As lightly described above, what makes Silent Scope so special is the challenge of coordinating two playing fields at the same time.  As the game starts, you'll get a huge view of a city area with terrorist all over the place.  From this faraway vantagepoint, you can easily see where the terrorists are hiding.  But to accurately hit them with your sniper rifle, you have to use the targeting ~virtual scope~.  Konami cleverly combined both elements together without losing the feeling of the arcade game: the screen displays the large area, but the targeting monitor is a tennis ball-sized circle (for a 20~ monitor, mind you) that displays a magnified view of the area you're observing.  With the zoom feature on you can precisely aim at the terrorist, with red arrows appearing in the ~virtual scope~ to help guide you to the nearest enemy.  And if you need to move to another area quickly, you can shut off the zoom feature by pressing and holding the B button on your controller.  When the scope is turned off, a red circular cursor appears that highlights the area, but not zooming until you release the B button.  Oh, and it seems Konami did add the VMU viewing idea, though you can't play the game this way due to the feeble viewing features of the Dreamcast VMU.    Visually, the game visuals are straight from the arcade machine, and while the graphics might be considered dated because of this, it's nonetheless solid.  The animations of enemies might be a bit slow and clunky, and while some of the explosion effects are first-generation quality, it's nothing that detracts from gameplay.  I especially enjoy the ~voyeur mode~ in the game; while you're busy shooting baddies off the roofs, certain areas of the game will have lovely polygon ladies.  Spotting one of these babes will give you a bonus life and it's certainly humorous as your ~virtual scope~ changes to a heart-shaped cursor.  If there's a disappoint in this game, it's the lack of any extra options.  Unlike SEGA arcade conversions to the Dreamcast where extra options are almost expected, Silent Scope for the Dreamcast has these main menu options: Arcade, Training, Options, and Ranking (as in ~score ranking~).  That's it.  And while the game is quite challenging, once you go through all the normal and hidden missions, there's not much gameplay left.  And you would think there would be some kind of challenge mode against ~Sniper Wolf~ of Metal Gear Solid fame, this being a Konami game.  But no, just an elegant and exact arcade port is all we get, though for most that should be enough.  With innovative play mechanics and decent visuals, Silent Scope gets the nod from me.  The lack of extra options is a definite bummer, and it doesn't seem a worthy purchase because of this.  But the challenging gameplay and clever game mechanics make this title stand out as a ~direct hit~.  --Anthony ~Sniper Tiger~ Chau, IGNDC Silent Scope is what it is: a mobile approximation of the arcade/console game. Go in with lofty expectations and you will be disappointed -- but that's what you'll have coming to you. Scale back your wants and Silent Scope provides some fine timekilling fun. It's not deep, it's not going to last forever on your handset. But if you can part with a few bucks and like the idea of dropping thugs with one between the eyes, Silent Scope will offer something for you.
