The game lighting up the canvas was none other than Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, one of the PS2's finest games. Nearly three years after that first glimpse, the PC is finally getting a version of that awesome game, only in the form of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, already released on PS2 and Xbox, a more complete and packed version of the game that adds more bang for your buck while retaining the fantastic story and sneaky gameplay that has become so popular in the series. Of course, PC ports always have their problems, mainly in the interfaces and options menus, but aside from one graphical glitch I encountered, the port is a good one once you figure out the controls. Not surprisingly, the PC version offers up all you can get in the consoles (with a couple of small exceptions) plus the added delight of much higher resolutions to make those crisp and clear graphics come snapping up for your enjoyment. Of course, just make sure you have a DVD drive and an NVIDIA graphics card because you won't be able to run the thing otherwise.   The Story   For those unfamiliar with the Metal Gear series (which would be suprising and shameful), here's a little background info: You assume the role of Solid Snake, co-founder of activist group Philanthropy, and ex-member of government special forces group, Fox-Hound. Your goal is to raise the public's awareness about the different Metal Gears (giant mech-like machines of mass destruction) that are created in hopes that their development will cease altogether. The other co-founder of Philanthropy, Hal ~Otacon~ Emmerich, was an engineer on the Metal Gear REX (from MGS1) project, and eventually switched sides after realizing the real reason Metal Gear was created (to use as a nuclear weapon). Every Metal Gear game involves some sort of new Metal Gear that is being built, and your mission to stop it. This one follows after the previous stories and has some references to them, but anybody new to the series shouldn't have too much of a problem getting the gist of things even if the story can get a bit crazy and convoluted at times. Regardless, those that do delve into the story are in for a cinematic treat. The Sons of Liberty storyline portion of Substance plays almost like a movie, only with you as the star. Lots of cutscenes will help with that feel.   Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance has several different components that will keep gamers glued to their computer screens for hours on end. The first and foremost for PC users that haven't had the chance to experience Sons of Liberty at all yet will be that story mode. Like the PS2 and Xbox vesions of the game, both the Tanker and Big Shell missions in the game can be played separately or together as found in the original version of this game. While the stories are connected, they're different enough that it's nice to be able to play through either of them without having to beat the game. While the story really begs to be told by the narration, it's fair to tell you that you'll have the chance to play as two different operatives, Snake and Raiden during the course of the game. Oh and there's a giant robot that can swim.   Hide and spring out at your enemies.  The Gameplay   While the story is nifty and all, there's a lot more to Substance than just the fiction. There's also a good amount of stealthy action to be had with Snake's full bag of tricks. The Metal Gear series favors stealth over brute force so you'll have zip that trap and try do go unseen whenever possible and make quick decisions about where to move and how to engage enemies when all other options are eliminated. You'll have some aids to help you in sneaking past the enemy such as the radar in the upper-right hand corner of the screen that displays your position, as well as enemy positions and their field of vision. If you are seen, your radar is disabled and the enemy will call for backup. If that happens, you must either try and kill them all, or run away hoping they don't shoot you down before you reach a safe hiding place. Just that option of staying and fighting makes things even more worthwhile to me. While Splinter Cell may be a superior game at this point in many ways, the near impossibility of escaping a hardcore firefight was frustrating. Substance not only allows you to fight through a mess, but also allows you to escape it to regroup.   Of course, if you're looking for a challenge, you can also pick to have that radar taken off completely so you can't see where the enemies are, and that can make things really difficult. The camera goes where the game wants it to, not where you want it to. While you can switch into first person mode to look around an area freely, you can't move through the level like that.   Being seen is not the only thing you have to worry about. The enemy also has ears, and if you make too much noise, they will go investigate the source of the sound. Walking on certain surfaces, shooting an un-silenced gun, leaving a blood trail, or even sneezing from a cold will get you in big trouble. Also, leaving a dead body lying around will alert the enemies of an intruder if seen, while knocking them out with a tranquilizer will cause their fellow soldiers to wake them up with a swift kick to the ribs. To solve this, like any good sneaker should allow, you can hide bodies in dark corners or lockers, and you can also throw them off the side of the ship in the tanker chapter. One small thing that bugs me is that dead bodies don't remain where you left them after you leave a specific portion of a level. Some continuity would have been appreciated, but can be lived without.   Being trained to be a one-man army by the government has its perks. Unlike most action games where the character can only run, shoot, and jump, Snake can do much, much more. For example, Snake can flatten himself against a wall and peek around corners to see what's there without being seen himself. He can also purposely create noises to lure soldiers around corners. Wanna hang from a ledge to hide yourself while the enemy passes you by? Go for it. How about hiding in an empty locker or used cardboard box? Sure, why not? While Sam Fisher and his splinter cell might have some cooler tricks up his sleeve at this point, Snake can still move and groove with the best of them.   Even though being stealthy and avoiding the enemy is best, you are not helpless. For one thing, you are skilled in hand-to-hand combat. You can pull of a punch/kick combo, perform a diving roll to knock down the enemy, and you can also choke someone from behind, eventually breaking their neck. Definitely the most silent way to kill an enemy.    But, if your hands are feeling a little sore, you can always revert to your weapons. Handguns, grenade and missile launchers, sniper guns, swords, and mines are all at your disposal. Your guns are useful for more than just killing. You can actually hold-up enemies convenient store-style and make them drop items. Or make them cringe in fear if you so please. The list of items is also extensive, though using all of them is not necessary. Cardboard boxes, magazines, night-vision goggles, and cold medicine are just a few of the items you'll find along the way. Heck, you can even smoke cigarettes if you want to! Just remember that if you do use normal weapons, the noise will attract unwanted attention from any guards in earshot and you might soon have a firefight on your hands if you can't find a decent hiding place.    While most of the story is told through the well placed cutscenes, you'll also gather more than a little info through your Codec, the auditory implant that allows communication with home base without messy radios or worry about enemies hearing the transmission. Your contact will give you ~sage~ advice every time you decide it necessary to reach out and say hello. You'll even get some pretty interesting responses if you contact people too many times. This Codec is also your save point. So just tune it to the correct frequency and save away.   The biggest bane of the console port usually comes with the interface. Most companies just don't take the time to really redo it and make it more useful to a PC user. It'll have all of the same great gameplay (or crappy gameplay I suppose), minus the fun and frolic of a nice and useable interface that takes advantage of a mouse. Substance is no exception. The fun and interest is still there, but the interface certainly leaves a lot to be desired. Configuring controls is probably the worst offender of all. I was going to try and play with the mouse and keyboard originally just to see how it faired and found the task to be too undesirable to really give an effort. Keys could not be undone, so if you wanted to reassign a key already in use you could, but it would remain in use for the other action as well. One key for 2 actions just doesn't work. Anyway, if you're going to play this game, you're going to want a gamepad anyway for analog control of movement. It's just too bad as it's a pain in the butt to aim using the right control stick compared to a mouse.   The Substance   Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is the same game thousands of gamers played on the PS2 when Sons of Liberty was released, only with a really nice bundle of extras added on. The largest of these is the addition of VR missions. These are just like the ones found in the original Metal Gear Solid, only reworked graphically, and including the new weapons found in Metal Gear Solid 2. These timed missions are completely independent of the game's story and test your skill with the character's abilities and weapons. The VR missions are broken down into four categories: Sneaking Mode, Weapon Mode, First Person View Mode, and Variety. Let's start with the Sneaking Mode.   Sneaking Mode is broken down into Sneaking and Eliminate All. In Sneaking, the objective is to reach the goal at the end of the level without being detected. The first few levels are extremely basic and contain a couple of enemies at most. Finishing these takes literally seconds to complete. The later levels become much more complex with the number of enemies increased, fewer places to hide, and multiple stories to navigate, just to name a few of the complications.   In Eliminate All, your job is to take out every enemy in the level within the time limit. The catch is that you have to do it without being seen. Again, the early levels start out relatively simple and get increasingly more difficult as you work your way through the levels. Disappearing floors, having your footprints glow, and tight spaces, along with everything else found in the Sneaking levels make your life a bit tougher than you'd like.     After Sneaking Mode comes Weapon Mode, which is broken down into the different types of weapons you will use during the course of the game. They are: Handgun, Assault Rifle, C4/Claymore, Grenade, PSG-1, Stinger, Nikita, and HF.Blade. When playing as Snake, the HF.Blade is unavailable, and is replaced by No Weapon. The weapons levels have you destroying targets within a set time limit with the given weapon. The targets themselves will take different shapes and sizes depending on the weapon level selected. Sometimes the targets will be stationary cubes while in other levels the targets may be moving diamonds that take multiple hits to destroy. There are roughly five different shapes the targets may take, with certain weapons being better suited to destroy them than others.   Moving down the line, we come to First Person View Mode. These levels are exactly what they sound like, VR missions with a first-person view, rather than the traditional third-person perspective the game normally uses. The objectives in these missions are just variations on the ones found in Sneaking and Weapons mode. Controlling your character in first-person is actually quite smooth. The button layout is more or less the same, with the major differences being the way you move and look around. Thankfully, there are three separate control configurations you can choose from, so you should be able to find one that suits your tastes. A fully configurable control scheme would've been nice, but the ones supplied are plenty sufficient.   After you complete the Sneaking, Weapon, and First Person Mode, you will unlock Variety Mode. This mode contains a, um, variety of different tasks you must complete, and they are definitely some of the most enjoyable ones because they offers something more than just sneaking or shooting. One of the most memorable ones asks you to reach a goal marker without being seen by any of the gigantic creatures, creatures meaning gigantic Godzilla-sized versions of the enemy soldiers. Not only are they Godzilla-sized, but they also stomp, roar, and have fins just like everyone's favorite rubber-suited Japanese lizard. Many of the other levels also provide some very cool moments, including a cameo by one very special girl, but there's no need to not spoil it for you.   You can choose to complete the VR missions with either Raiden or Snake, with Snake's levels tending to be a little bit more difficult and have different enemy placement. After you complete a set number of levels, you will open up a new version of Raiden or Snake, depending on whom you used to complete the missions. These alternate versions are really just costume changes, but there are some really cool outfits, including the Ninja outfit, and Snake's original costume from MGS1. Each character variation also has their own set VR missions to tackle, but they are not as numerous as Raiden's and Snake's.   After you complete each level you are given a score and, if you score high enough, are placed in the top three rankings. You score is calculated from three different factors: time, bullets used, and a no-kill bonus. Ideally you want to complete the missions in the quickest time possible, and only use the amount of bullets needed to complete the mission. If you score first place in any of the missions, you can view a clear code which you can enter in at the Substance website.   In addition to the VR missions, there is an Alternative missions mode, which can also be played by any of the characters. These are similar to the VR missions but take place in sections of the game's levels (the tanker, the Arena, and the Big Shell) rather than in the VR-constructed levels. The types of objectives are also slightly different, and consist of things like bomb diffusing, taking pictures, and practicing your hold-up skills. These levels were originally supposed to be included in Sons of Liberty, but were left out due to time constraints. Because Sons of Liberty was so story-driven, and was not really focused on the action aspects of the game, many gameplay aspects were not fully realized. So, to shift the focus back on the gameplay aspects of the game, the Alternative missions were added. Like the VR missions, the different costumed characters have their own set of Alternative missions.   Overall, the VR and Alternative missions are a great addition. They are quick to get into, enjoyable, challenging, and addictive. They'll really test your Metal Gear skills to their limit. Trying to score first place in each of the VR missions alone (there are roughly 200 of them) may turn you into an obsessive-compulsive Metal Gear hermit, so be careful. Now all we need is the godfathers of the series to put the same intense and in-depth gameplay into an environment riddled with the same quality of storytelling. Hopefully the next iteration of the series will bring the entire package together as one.    The other major addition to Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is a mode labeled Snake Tales. Unlike the VR or Alternative missions, the five Snake Tales are story based, and though the story elements use characters and environments from the Sons of Liberty game, they are unrelated to the main storyline.   The story is told through text pages. While the story doesn't read entirely well and doesn't work as nicely as when told through the fantastic cutscenes, the attempt is appreciated nonetheless. These ~what if~ missions definitely have their appeal, and being able to play as Snake in the Big Shell level is reward enough. The length of the missions ranges from short to medium to long in length, with the longest ones taking about the same amount of time as an objective in the main game.   A big difference between these missions and the ones in the main quest is that not only do you not have access to the Codec, but there is also no radar, which makes them pretty tough. Still, they are, like the other extra missions, highly rewarding and definitely challenging.   Graphics   There is, of course, a quality difference between the PC and console versions of the game. The PC just has the power on this one and the ability to project higher resolutions on monitors. So forget that 640x480 and crank that sucker up so it looks like it should on a real system. At the time of release, MGS2 looked really, really good. Everything from the actual character models to the effects and animations were top notch. And while it may not hang with the best games on the PC nowadays, it still looks darn good.   Undoubtedly, one of the biggest selling points from a graphical standpoint of the game are the terrific character models and lifelike animations that accompany them. There's something magical about watching Snake slide along a wall and peek around a corner only to jump out and ambush an enemy. Whether it be crawling, fighting, or dragging bodies across the ground, there are some fantastic opportunities to watch good animation at work.     The game runs about as smooth as can be on an average computer of 1.4Ghz, 512 MB of RAM, and a GeForce3 at 1024x768, so you can figure almost any gamer with a 3D card will be able to have a smooth and enjoyable experience with the game. Wait... let me change that. Anybody with one of the supported NVIDIA chipsets will be able to enjoy the game. You'll also want to remember that to run Substance, you'll have to have a DVD player on your computer. This is a straight port from the DVD version on the consoles. Consequently, you should also expect a very hefty install. A half install comes in a 3.9GB of hard disk space and the full install is a whopping and whooping 7.6GB. Yikes! Better clear out some of that porn and make room for the game.   Unfortunately, you won't find any of the real time lighting found in Splinter Cell, nor will you find many of the more detailed textures found in many straight PC and Xbox games, but I wouldn't go and say this detracts from the fun of the experience.    The Sound   The sound of Substance is right on par with the graphics for the most part. From the dramatic cutscenes to the hallways of the tanker quiet except for the low humming of the engine in the distance, it all sounds good... when it sounds at all. Unfortunately, sometimes, things that should have made sounds, such as a guard jumping to alert, a gun going off, or a tell tale sign of attack from a boss didn't actually make any sound at all. Thankfully, this wasn't something that happened much as it could have really messed the experience up, but it's certainly a problem.   Instead of constant techno thumping or the like, the music is not always in full force. In fact, most of the gameplay time is accompanied by subtle, ambient sounds and music. Things do pick up, like when you are spotted by a soldier, and when they do, it can be very unnerving. The jerking alert sound used when detected, along with the suspenseful background music are done well.   Substance also brings quality voice acting to the table, especially the character of Solid Snake, voiced by David Hayter. Hayter has quite a bit of experience doing voices for not only games, but animation as well. He has had voice roles in Miyazaki's The Castle of Cagliostro, Fushigi Yugi, Cowboy Bebop, as well as Nintendo's latest horror game, Eternal Darkness. His rough, throaty voice is so perfect for Snake, it's hard to imagine him sounding like anyone else. All the other voices are done just as well, and also do a fine job at giving their characters a little more life.Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance has finally arrived for the PC. This is definitely a console style game with the fixed camera and funky controls, but it certainly packs a punch. The gameplay is still superb, although outmatched by Splinter Cell in some cases, and the amount of extra material will keep you busy for many hours. All they need is to figure out some multiplayer solutions and they'd be set for replayability.Those that haven't gotten a chance to play Sons of Liberty yet will certainly be pleased with this PC version as it delivers up all the goods in much higher resolutions than any console can begin to imagine. If you're looking for a stealth action game that isn't quite as strictly difficult as Splinter Cell, this is most certainly a good choice. If you've already played the Sons of Liberty levels, you'll have to decide for yourself how much you liked the game and how much more you want to play. You'd be the best judge as to whether it's worth your money for a bunch of VR and extra missions.Now we just need to convince developers to spend the time to convert option and game menus to be more PC audience friendly and we'll be ready to steal more quality titles like Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance from the console kids.", "date": "Apr 2, 2003"}
