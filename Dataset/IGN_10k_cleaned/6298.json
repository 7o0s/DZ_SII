I-play's mobile edition of the popular toy from Radica is a faithful adaptation of the classic game of ~twenty questions,~ where somebody thinks of an object (plant, animal, vegetable) and everybody tries to gather clues by asking yes or no questions. With I-play's 20Q, the phone plays the role of grand inquisitor, asking a series of question that start out quite broad that eventually become very pointed.   As the player, you want to stump 20Q. But to enjoy it, you have to be honest. You cannot change objects midstream, and you need to answer questions accurately. If you do, you may find yourself surprised at the uncanny omniscience of 20Q. I was once able to stump 20Q while think of a blackberry -- it guessed strawberry. However, when thinking of animals, 20Q was able to nail it very time. Of course, I didn't try to get cute and think of obscure animals or bugs -- I stuck with basics, like giraffes and zebras.   20Q is going to appeal to a very general audience. If you are a hardcore gamers that loves to twitch the thumbs, may I recommend Crash tag Team Racing, instead? But as a kind of casual piece of entertainment, 20Q is a success. The number of times you can play is pretty much limited only by the number of things you can think of. And there is a sense of victory when you do stump 20Q.  20Q would be perfect for road trips, long lines, or any occasion where you need your attention diverted. (Unless you're the driver of said road trip...) It's a good non-game game, a great way to burn five minutes here or there -- but tit does require some involvement, as you must often think for a second before answering one of 20Q's queries. You need to be as accurate as possible to get the most out of the app. While 20Q wasn't necessarily my bag, I also played it in my office. In one of the abovementioned conditions, though, I can see the real value that 20Q offers.", "date": "Nov 9, 2005"}
