We did, and we loved it -- it was a great little to-go golf game that entertained us for several hours. So, when we saw JAMDAT Golf 2004 appear on the decks, we downloaded it with similar expectations. What we ended up with, though, was a four-dollar case of deja vu.   Features:   Swing meter  Player animations  Download new courses   Somewhere along the way, the Tiger got loose. In his absence, JAMDAT has opted to keep on keepin' on, crafting a golf game from all of the elements of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004, just without all that expensive licensing stuff, like players and real-life courses. So, essentially, what we have here is the exact same game, just different courses.   Now, we enjoyed Tiger Woods PGA tour 2004's excellent game mechanics, such as the swing meter that made hitting par much easier than on competing golf games. JAMDAT Golf 2004 ports over the meter, as well as the little animation that goes with it. Except in this game, Tiger's trademark black and red outfit in the animation has been replaced by a non-descript fellow in casual golf gear.   If you're not familiar with the way the game works, JAMDAT has included a tutorial that nudges you along while you learn the ropes. Make sure you use the green overview so you know the course ahead, select your club, and fire up the swing meter.   The swing meter is a multi-colored arc that appears around your player. Press the action key to begin filling the meter. When the ball reaches the small green silver, tap action again -- this selects the optimal amount of power. Then, the meter starts back down. Tap the action again when the meter crosses the bottom green silver -- this controls the accuracy of the shot.   Once you reach the green, you use a similar meter to judge the strength of your putt. A flat meter across the bottom slowly fills. Tap the action key when the meter is just under the tiny red flag to make your shot. Of course, you'll need to consider the grade of the green before putting. Little arrows reveal if the green slopes in any direction, and you'll have to take that into consideration when putting.   Now, without the full PGA license, JAMDAT Golf 2004 uses fantasy courses. Not the kind with the windmills and Jackie Mason, but made-up fairways. To be honest, unless you're Arnold Palmer's illegitimate child, you'll never know the difference. They look and feel right, with a fair amount of sand traps and water hazards. And when you've completely mastered a course, you can download new courses from JAMDAT's server.If you've already downloaded Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 and still have it on your handset, there's really no reason to download JAMDAT Golf 2004 at all. They may as well be the same game. However, if you've been looking for a good golfer and missed Tiger's outing earlier this year, then JAMDAT Golf 2004 is heartily recommended.", "date": "May 25, 2004"}
