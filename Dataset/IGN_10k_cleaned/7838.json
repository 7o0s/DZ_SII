He lusts for the throne without end. You, humble dwarf, seek his downfall. You seek it alone, or with friend. The quest is a long one, the dangers are many. Unrelenting the Adder's attacks. But you, humble dwarf, will find victory  if with mastery you wield Golden Axe.    Many early Genesis games were ports from the arcade. And many arcade games of the time were side-scrolling brawlers  Double Dragon came from Taito, Capcom had Final Fight, and Sega had both Altered Beast and Golden Axe. Axe set itself apart from the pack with a unique storyline and setting, some fresh gameplay ideas and a variety of selectable heroes.   The story finds the fantasy realm of Yuria overrun by the hordes of the Death Adder. The Adder has captured Yuria's rulers, and is threatening their execution if the population of peasants refuses to acknowledge him as their new, and only, king. The land is evocative of other fantasy worlds, like those seen in Willow or Conan the Barbarian. Expectedly, then, a barbarian is one possible character choice.     Ax Battler is a human warrior, a man who ignores the obvious implications of his name and instead fights evil with a broadsword. Also sworded is Tyris Flare, a female fighter who commands fire magic. It's with the third and final hero, Gilius Thunderhead, that the titular axe firsts appears. The stout dwarven soldier wields a glimmering blade of battle, ferociously felling foes like so many helpless trees, blinded as they are by the shining, shimmering ... wait a second.   That axe isn't golden.   Something got lost in the translation when Golden Axe came to the Genesis, because in this version Gilius' weapon is silver. In fact, much of the game world looks tarnished  a lack of vibrancy and detail plagues the title's graphics, in comparison to its arcade source. The audio, too, is compromised. Some digitized voice clips feel forced here, and the sound quality seems poor overall. It looks like this is another case of the Virtual Console getting a watered-down, incomplete port of an arcade title rather than the arcade title itself.   And yet Axe's offenses aren't egregious. A complaint made of the Virtual Console's version of Donkey Kong is that it removed a level found in the arcade. This edition of Golden Axe does the opposite, actually adding new stages of play. Added, too, are two alternate play modes  Beginner Mode, for players seeking a lesser challenge than the main quest offers, and Duel Mode, a parade of succeedingly more difficult battles that expert fighters can face to hone their skills.     The fun of Golden Axe's core gameplay is suitably translated too. It's a simple side-scrolling brawler, but each of the three choosable characters offers something unique. Each character has his or her own magical power, for example  screen-clearing super attacks fueled by collectible potion jars. And each character can find and mount a variety of rideable beasts throughout the adventure, including fire-breathing dragons and the infamous Altered Beast cross-over creature, Chicken Leg. So Golden Axe is a title of compromise. New features were added for the Genesis version, while the clarity of its graphics and sound took a hit. It's a fair enough balance for a Wii download, but the option of choice would be nice. Perhaps the future will find the arcade version available, which would do gamers new to the world a favor. As things stand now, it's confusing  this game should be Grey Axe instead.", "date": "Dec 15, 2006"}
