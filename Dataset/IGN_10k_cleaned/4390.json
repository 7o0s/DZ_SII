The Army of Zin", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/18/maximo-vs-the-army-of-zin", "text": "I almost entirely forgot what it was like to play the great old 8-bit games. Looking back, the violence was cartoonish, the graphics almost inconsequential, and the gameplay, at least in the best games, was tight, clever, and unforgiving. Yes, there was rarely story, glitz, or God forbid, cutscenes, but I guess we used our imaginations a little more back then. If the onslaught of the 3D polygonal world has taught us one thing, it's that those many of those old games, for better of worse, were damned hard.   What's been lost in these days of Halo and Prince of Persia is the reward for endeavoring to beat such games. While neither of those games is easy, beating Super Mario Brothers or say, Ghouls and Ghosts was like pulling teeth. Those games are the reason cheats were created. Capcom Entertainment, in its quest to mine the great titles of its golden past, has revived the brilliance of the brutal, teeth-pulling action-platformer with the Maximo series. Maximo Vs. The Army of Zin is the second in that revival, a 3D action-platformer that's short on story and long in gameplay, and hey, it's even got it's own share of cutscenes too.    After its debut exclusively on PlayStation 2 in early 2002, Capcom's series has returned like a healthy veteran. The key premise of the original is still intact, but the harsh corners and slight unbalances have been honed and (mostly) polished, and fighting the singular soul-powered army of infinite variation and strength gives Maximo Vs. The Army of Zin a sense of cohesion the former lacked.   Gameplay  In most respects, Maximo Vs. The Army of Zin is just like the original. It's an action-platformer in the most basic sense. It retains the brilliant arcade quickness of the original, the tongue-in-cheek humor, and that distinct level of difficulty we all know and love (or love to hate). IGN's database doesn't even have that category in its gamut of genres, but there's no denying it here -- it's a 2D action-platformer in 3D. Players take control of the good knight Maximo and rightly go about hacking enemies into chunks, fighting bosses and trekking through dangerous lands in search of Maximo's long-lost princess Sophia.

Get The Guide | See Other Guides   This story unfolds 500 years before Ghosts to Glory in an intro scene. Lord Morgan Hawkmoor and his army confront a massive assault from an evil army of powerful antiquated robot soldiers. Powered by encapsulated souls, the army is unstoppable, regenerating infinitely. In a bold but tragic tactic to crush the Army of Zin for good, Lord Hawkmoor and his legion force the evil death squad into a powerful vault, and he remains there as they shut the door, sealing his doom. His lasts words are like an omen for the people of Hawkmoor -- Never open the vault.     Five hundred years later and eight months after Ghosts to Glory, Maximo and his ~buddy~ Grim (the Grim Reaper) discover that a deadly army is ransacking the land, each one powered by a strange blue sphere. After having lost Sophia in the first game, Maximo continues his vigilant search for his long-lost love Sophia, searching in village after village. It's clear to you and I that the Army of Zin has escaped from the Vault, but Maximo must discover it in his own way.   Capcom Digital Studios has studiously taken into account the criticisms and compliments given its game two years ago. The biggest differences are quite subtle, emerging in more polished levels, a slight interface re-structuring, and better balance -- all of which make this a well balanced title. From the start, the biggest changes come in the form of NPCs (non-player characters), new levels, and if you played the first, the instant access to super moves. Perhaps even more exciting is the ability to summon and play as the Grim Reaper, an invulnerable fighting machine who is, of course, already dead. Those well versed in the old series will notice less Earthquakes and ground shifting. Instead of opening rifts in the Earth, Zin's army shifts the environment, burns and plunders villages and destroys most everything it touches.      Giving players the hefty moves from the get-to is smart. The game instantly gives players a range of attacks -- vertical and horizontal attacks, a quick multi-stab attack, and the use of Grim -- and intelligently, Capcom has thus increased enemy numbers and strength to balance those gifts.  The NPC addition is cool, because it's voluntary. Players have the opportunity to save villagers, who, if saved, give Maximo gifts in the form of money, armor or health. Even more important, some of the NPCs are merchants who sell goods. These guys act as the game's upgrade shop, enabling players to purchase necessary goods for the later levels and bosses. Using Grim is short-lived bliss. In the upper left-hand corner is a blue quarter circle showing the time Maximo can summon and use him in combat. Usually, players can fight as Grim for about five to 10 seconds; for the right amount of Koins, however, players can increase this gauge for longer bouts.    Maximo finds three additional weapons in his adventure. He starts out with a humble sword, then earns the Heroes Hammer, a giant brutal hammer good for crushing enemies and opening stone doors; Flame-Tongue, a fiery new sword with increased speed and fire abilities; and an additional hammer that freezes enemies in place. It's this last weapon that comes in handiest near the end. Players can buy about five enhancements for each kind of weapon, some of them more useful than others. Like in Ghosts to Glory, gamers constantly change armor. Along with the handful of armors upgrades, players attain up to five kinds of boxers. YES! Boxers! By buying and wearing each set, players can find secret treasure, increase their super meter faster, upgrade armor and more. They're not just for good looks, these threads, they're actually useful. Overall, the weapon set is satisfying and bountiful.    Underneath the obvious layer of additions are the more subtle changes. Capcom has paid particular attention to the platform aspect of Ghosts to Glory and has adjusted and tuned it in The Army of Zin. While I may have yelled at Ghosts to Glory two years ago, I never complained about its difficulty. Yet the platforming was tough. With The Army of Zin, it's clear that Capcom has taken painstaking steps to find the right balance between difficulty and pleasure, and the result has paid off. It doesn't seem all that much easier, but the move set is greater, and the game structure itself is less harsh. It doesn't punish you for dying. The levels are structured with clear beginnings and ends and good check points and save points throughout -- and the cost of dying doesn't increase each time you die. The hub system has been replaced with a linear map system, wherein levels can be replayed after being beaten. This way, the perfectionist in you can attain all the secrets, enemies, and save all the villagers to make that 100% mark.     The level design is as expected, it's a careful blend of platforming and hacking, with secret-finding, physical puzzles and boss fights. The game controls are the key here: They're quick and instant, perfectly responsive to every encounter. There are tons of little areas requiring the double jump that make you smile with glee. It's a real proper double jump. You hop into the air and then the second jump actually gives you more yardage and extra air. The levels are beautifully crafted around daring gamers to skillfully grab out-of-reach items. The reward, naturally, is getting that Death Koin, much needed Armor upgrade, or Diamond. Or it's death. One other thing: When Maximo opens a chest, the enemy action actually stops -- enemies literally freezing air -- so not as to cheat gamers. Nice stuff.    If the platforming was too hard in Ghosts to Glory, the bosses were too easy. With The Army of Zin, the two grow increasingly and equally difficult as the game progresses. This time around, the boss fights aren't all about finding that singular weak spot and then breezing through the remainder of the fight. These fights range from sea monsters with poison gas gills and fiery breath, chickens with Gattling guns for wings, to giant eyeballs strapped into robotic crab bodies and human confrontations with (almost) straight-up swordfights. Some of these bouts are real slogs, where you just inch your way out. Different indeed from 2002.   The Army of Zin is probably a 10-15 hour game at max, which seems shorter than its predecessor. But honestly, I don't think it's because there is less gameplay here; instead it's because The Army of Zin is more forgiving than its brethren. The camera, which caused some complaints in the original, is a third-person perspective cam that can be switched manually, and that generally, usually, gets to the right spot when you need it to. About 5% of the time the camera gets a little stuck, or doesn't get to the point you want it. It's very much like the Super Mario 64 camera, with it strengths and weaknesses intact.     Graphics  This is a game that holds close to its heart the idea that gameplay comes first, graphics second. With such a philosophy, you'd expect poor visuals. The Army of Zin is instead a game that has a sense of humor about it. It's cartoonish in design, with super-deformed characters, fantasy backgrounds, and a smallish sense of identity. But that little guy mentality is countered with giant, and superbly designed, monsters and Maximo himself, who's a ferocious one-man army.    Texture-wise, there is little to write home about. The tongue-in-cheek art design is likeable, even funny with such simple structures, forests, beaches and caves, but it's not poorly done. Where The Army of Zin exceeds is in its particles system, animation, and creature design. You'll see tons of sparks flying, enemies bursting into chunks, smoky flaming enemies streaking through the sky with smoke billowing behind them, and wherever there is fire, healthy heat blurs.    The Capcom art team seized the opportunity to create a profusion of enemy types for the Army of Zin, and the result is an inspiring, creative and enjoyable cast of baddies. The same goes for the bosses, which are big, (mostly) original, and sometimes very funny.    Lastly, the designers and artists have kept the framerate high, the animations very smooth, and the controls responsive. The animations probably aren't the most beautiful you've ever seen, but they're efficient, quick, and don't ever get in the way -- a great solution in my book.  One more thing -- has Maximo's head grown narrower? He looks a little troubling, like his head was stuck inside a jar for too long. Oh yeah, and am I the only one, or does that intro screen look like a parody of the first Onimusha? You know, the one with that huge field of dead enemies lined up and marching into the screen with Nobunaga?    Sound  Sticking to its roots, The Army of Zin provides a medley of 8- and 16-bit tunes that have been substantially ramped up and filled out for today's demanding audiophiles. Each realm offers a different theme, with small variations, but you could of sworn you heard these in Ghouls and Ghosts or Ghosts and Goblins. The beepy, simple techno tunes are catchy, even likeable, they're just old-school.    The voice acting, like the visual design, appears to have been done in such a way to seem cheesy yet likeably tongue-in-cheek. The character voices are all silly, even a little deliberate, as if this hardy little platformer was instead a dress comedy. High-end stereophonic fans won't get a break here, since the game doesn't offer anything in the way of progression. It's stereo or mono, kids. Oh, and at least form the option menu, there is no wide-screen or progressive scan abilities either.If you're wondering why The Army of Zin got a lower score than its predecessor, it's simple. Ghosts to Glory came out two years ago, relatively early in the system's cycle, and the game was a first in many ways. As technology progresses and games get better, we keep moving the grade scale up too. The Army of Zin is an excellent game, and one I personally would recommend to every PS2 owner, and it's better than the original. But two years later, the game is still very much like the first in gameplay, graphics and sound. It doesn't offer the little things that every publisher seems to offers now -- widescreen options, Dobly Pro Logic II; and the game design itself isn't as ambitious as other similar games of its kind. The game's other problems are small. The camera isn't perfect (though what 3D camera is?), and it can every so often get in the way. Also, surprisingly, Maximo isn't as long as I remember Ghosts to Glory, but I know that comes down to the fact that it's not filled with as many frustrating moments, either. It's about 10-15 hours maximo (heh). Occasionally, there are slowdown moments, and in several levels, we noticed seam tearing in the backgrounds.But honestly, it's hard not to like Maximo Vs. the Army of Zin. You either have to be a horrible gamer or a person who hates games. Or dead. It's an inoffensive action-platformer that's safe for kids, great for old-school players, and that packs a hearty set of levels and bosses in it. The upsides are that it's fast and deep, well polished and balanced, and it's rewarding. The slightly new structure is subtle but effective in making the game a little less harsh, a little less unforgiving. And perhaps, most importantly, you're sure to feel that old-school sense of satisfaction for having beaten each level and every boss.", "date": "Jan 18, 2004"}
