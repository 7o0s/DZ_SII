This game isn't a bad little adventure if you're an avid watcher of the Cartoon Network series, or if you just want to hack and slash some futuristic evil; but just be prepared to fight with the controls, and don't expect the most intense action, either. Features Seven different lands Upgradeable moves Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  Samurai Jack is an animated series airing on Cartoon Network, an action/adventure with an arching plotline focused on Jack, a Japanese samurai who has been banished to a very, very twisted future by the evil shape-shifting wizard Aku. In the show, Jack wanders the land searching for a portal back to his own time in order to change events that led to the twisted future. The game takes place within this future, where Jack learns of an ancient amulet that can send him back to his proper point in time...but over the years, the pieces of the amulet have been scattered all over the world. So, Jack must take katana in hand and make his way through seven different lands in order to score the amulet pieces.  In the game, players will work their way through seven different areas, hacking, slashing, jumping and crawling through the different hazards. The benefit of each amulet piece is, of course the magic that they contain within...and it's magic that Jack can utilize to get to other parts of the game's world, but he has to find them first. Jack will also earn additional abilities beyond what he starts out with, like a double jump to get to those out of reach platforms.  The game was made by European developer Virtucraft, and it's obvious that the team used the past two Castlevania games on the GBA as a sort of blueprint for Samurai Jack on the handheld. The similarities are far from coincidental: the status screen, for example, is certainly derived from the layout that's in Konami's game, with the game's progress listed in percentage points, as well as how much time has expired in the game. The map, while a welcome edition, has obviously been made with Castlevania's layout in mind...though Samurai Jack's layout seems to be a little more confusing and way too large to fit on a single screen.  But despite borrowing many of its gameplay elements from a really good game design, the developers of Samurai Jack failed to make its own game as good. Sloppy attention to the way Jack runs, jumps and attacks with his blade make the action a bit too clumsy, and collision detection seems to be sporadic in its implementation. And while some parts of the game are frustratingly bad (throwing so many enemies at Jack in one location, with literally no escape other than dying), the addition of the potion system makes the game actually way too easy; players can carry as many as 99 health potions (and they are plentiful) which can be consumed anywhere and anytime during the game; even while surrounded by rabid enemies. Dying in this game happens either A) when players aren't paying attention, or B) when players get stuck in an area they're not supposed to be.  Even though it's not an easy game to die in, Samurai Jack's challenge comes from the level exploration and successfully traversing the areas laid out by the designers. In this case, it's not so bad, and it really reminds players of Metroid and Castlevania, since certain areas are blocked off due to some element that can be overcome only when a certain ability is earned.  Lifting great ideas out of great games doesn't always net a great design in a new game. It's certainly beneficial for designers to build off of successful design elements, but they have to make sure that their own elements are good as well...and in the case of Samurai Jack, the game's stiff control and collision detection make the experience a frustrating one...even though there are a good amount of nice features throughout the adventure.", "date": "Mar 26, 2003"}
