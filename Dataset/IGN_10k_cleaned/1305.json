This game can hurt. Not since the days of the original Nintendo Entertainment System and it's good buddy the Sega Master, have my forearms felt this out of shape. Par for the course when partaking in silicon sessions of the 8-bit era, frantic button mashing was all part of the experience back then. But with the advent of pressure-sensitive controllers, analog sticks, and multiple turbo triggers, pounding away at your game pad has become a bit of a barbaric  clich.Which brings us to Konami's latest incarnation of their older than dirt athletic series, ESPN International Track & Field. A game that not only challenges you to dust off your 8-bit playing styles and put them to work, but also one that demands every ounce of your mental and physical strength. Love it or hate it, you have to admit that it at least keeps the true spirit of the Olympic games alive.A port of International Track & Field 2000 for those other systems, this game's measure of fun is just like the rest of its comrades in the genre; a combination of the good and the bad. Using a slight variation on the same early 80's control set from event to event, certain competitions can shine while others falter terribly. Basically a contest to see how quickly you can press the ~X~ and ~B~ buttons at alternating speeds, the control scheme is not for everyone. Which will probably be realized the first time your hands are ripped open from blisters, and spill a gallon of plasma onto the floor.The events themselves are an eclectic mix of the various sports you've seen over the years in previous games, and outnumber both Sydney 2000 and Virtua Athlete 2K. The 100 Meter Dash, Long Jump, Hammer Throw, Weightlifting Jerk & Pull, Pole Vault, Javelin Throw, 110 Meter Hurdles, Horizontal Bar, Triple Jump, High Jump, Women's Vault, and Trap Shooting events are all here and accounted for (but no Arm Wrestling competition from Track & Field 2 damn it! When will they ever learn?). Some of these events however, aren't immediately selectable and must be unlocked through victories in other events. A process that can take a very long time if patience isn't one of your better virtues.While many Olympic fans out there may be excited at the prospect of so many events, the sad truth of the matter is, that only a few of them are really any good. Weightlifting, Javelin Throw, Horizontal Bar, Hammer Throw, and Trap Shooting can be really fun, and trying to break your previous world records in these events are pretty much the meat of the experience. Other events however, are either too damn difficult for their own good or so much like another competition that it's really not worth the bother. How many times can you press the same combination of keys over and over again anyhow?Of course, the main problem that plagues those remaining events is how furiously you have to tap some of these buttons to win (especially 100 Meter Dash or 110 Meter Hurdles). So unbelievably tough are they, that without the help of some kind of turbo-enhanced controller, you are up the creek without a paddle. Pound those buttons until your heart's content... burn those arm muscles into a cinder... it doesn't matter, you still won't place. What kind of a gameplay element is that?Not that the game doesn't look good, it does. Easily eclipsing any previous game in the genre, International Track & Field earns most of it's points on presentation and visual impact. Dramatic camera angles, beautiful sunsets, and breathtaking shots of a full moon provide some very pleasing eye fodder. And though a couple of the athletes may occasionally appear awkward, clever use of the motion blur effect can quickly hide any polygonal shortcomings. Too bad it isn't enough to make up for a tip-tap gameplay engine that's years behind the times.A weekend party rental at best, IT&F unfortunately hasn't progressed much since the days of the original title. And though the first two games took the Nintendo Entertainment System by storm, the updated Dreamcast version's chances of similarly conquering a system are slim and none. Almost too simple in execution, and overly difficult when it comes to reaching the main goal, the quest for the gold isn't quite what it's cracked up to be.-- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDCAs much as I love playing this game, and as positively as I can write this review, the overall game design of ESPN International Track & Field isn't very gamer-friendly. It's not a game you can easily pick up and play with three other friends -- it takes practice to learn the nuances in each of the events, and when you do actually get good at the game, playing against novices is not only unfair, but also embarrassing for them. I couldn't find anyone in the office that could give a proper challenge, but that's only because I've known how to play the game since the first game hit the original PS four years ago. And since International Track & Field is my one real niche in the videogame market, the game took literally two hours to break all the records and unlock all the hidden treats. This is a game that's only going to last you a long time by playing it multiplayer  but you might find it difficult to find friends who have the same appreciative tastes for Track & Field.", "date": "Oct 4, 2000"}
