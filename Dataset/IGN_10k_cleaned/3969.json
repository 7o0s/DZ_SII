Unfortunately, the somewhat cumbersome resource management and uninspiring strategic elements prevented it from becoming a breakout title. Now, almost two years later, Nival Interactive has extensively re-tooled what didn't work and left the good stuff alone. Unfortunately, even in its vastly improved state, it's still weighed down by some frustrating design decisions.   But I'm getting ahead of myself. In case you're new to the Etherlords (and most people are), let me give a breakdown of how the combat system works, since it's not just a matter of click-and-dragging to select your units, then clicking on the enemy. No, sir. The sequel has switched to a pool of sixteen single-use cards, instead of a rotating pool of five, although you can upgrade your hero to use a card up to seven times before it goes back it becomes inactive. At the beginning of battle, five cards are drawn randomly from your pool, cards you have chosen from your total reserve. You'll have one point of ~ether~ (read: mana) in the first round, and you'll get an additional ~ether channel~ with every round thereafter. The number of ether channels determines how many ether points you can spend every round. You can choose to hold on to your ether points to save up for a big spell, or cast a spell that increases your channels. There are three classes of spells, too: Summoning, Sorcery and Enchantment. Summoning conjures creatures, Sorcery allows your hero to damage enemy units directly, and Enchantment will buff or de-buff a given unit or all units at once. So there's plenty of variety and depth here, and I'm not giving a complete snapshot, but the in-game tutorials do a good job of explaining how everything works.   You may have noticed I said, ~hero,~ not ~heroes.~ This time around you control one hero at a time, and carry him or her over from scenario to scenario until you get to the next stage, where you control a hero from another faction in a parallel storyline. You start off the game choosing from either the warlike faction or the nature-oriented faction. After you've gone through four ~mini-campaigns,~ you'll have access to a fifth campaign where you'll be in control of Diamanda, an almost mythical hero in the Etherlords universe.     Each faction has a theme, too. The Chaots are Klingon types, the Synthets are cybernetic, the Kinets are flight-oriented, and so forth. It isn't just cosmetic. Each faction is capable of something quite different from another. In your travels across the land, your hero will fight heroes from other factions, and each battle is slightly different, thanks to the unique spells the enemy has access too, especially Pale Magic.    Voice acting was hit-or-miss. Your controllable heroes are a generally fun listen, especially the outrageously bloodthirsty Konnar, who sounds like he gargles with broken glass. You'll also get some genuine-sounding Irish, Scottish, Cockney and other non-American accents that give the game a subtly foreign flavor, in a good way. However, some secondary characters are unforgivably hammy, delivering their lines with an uncomfortable combination of Shakespearean gravity and Biblical intensity that just makes you roll your eyes and wonder where these people come from.     Unfortunately, variety can be a double-edged swordespecially when you don't know what you're up against. The card-based nature of Etherlords means you can't get a peek at their unit stack. Surprise is a huge element, and I never got the sense that the AI was aware of what cards I had at my disposal. But since every fight is so different, consider yourself lucky if you beat someone the first time through using the same selections from your previous fight. I clocked myself playing against one foe for more than an hour and a half on Medium difficulty. Each battle will take you upwards of ten minutes (or it seems that way, as time has a way of disappearing when you really concentrate on the game). So it gets pretty frustrating when this foe is blocking a location you need to get to or some foozle you need to open a door. Yet even if you can pass the enemy up, it's best to fight them so you can have decent enough stats to combat the people you have to face.   Why did it take so long? Regeneration. And not any kind of run-of-the-mill regeneration. Many units have the chance to avoid death if they get down to one health point and are about to be struck by a killing blow. The problem is that this ~saving throw~ is set way too high. Plus, if they succeed, they get all their health points back. This happens eventually anyway, but usually not until the end of the round. Take one regenerating creature with, say, ten points of health and make it go up against three units capable of six points of damage. First guy takes the enemy unit down to four points of health, second guy fails against the saving throw and brings the enemy back to ten health points, making your third attack pointless.   Sorcery spells are equally prone to this perk; the only way to be sure you'll actually kill a regenerating unit is to completely annihilate it, and you can imagine those spells are hard to come by. Plus, that particular spell removed that unit from play altogether, which means you can't use that kill in a graveyard attack. (When a unit dies, its card goes to a ~graveyard~ stack that the hero can still resurrect it from, and your hero can also cast a spell that does the enemy hero two points of damage for every unit in its graveyard.) The saving throw specialization should have been set somewhere around a 10-15% chance to survive, but by my rough estimation, it was sailing well over 50%. That's just not fun. Although you can surrender a fight at any time and restart it with full health and a full deck, it just doesn't make much sense to commit so much time to one battle.     Paradoxically, it was possible to plow brutally through an enemy with the same set of spells, assuming they couldn't regenerate. With enough unit destruction spells, ether channel boosts and graveyard attacks, you could send them packing without summoning a single unit of your own. Plus, there's this spell called Comet which allows you to do damage directly to the hero, rather than through your own units (heroes never fight each other directly). You can pour as many ether points as you have into it, and do one point of damage for each ether point, minus the cost of actually casting the spell. Combine this with spells that increase your number of channels, and you can rock their world fairly quickly. You'll rarely fight a hero with over 50 health points, and it's not unusual to do 20 points of damage with one Comet.      However, the enemy AI, on Medium difficulty, will never make a mistake. It will never just send units blindly into battle if it knows they will get slaughtered. It will summon units to match yours, and won't hold back the hurt. Since a given unit can only defend or attack in a given round (minus the occasional built-in ability or hero enchantment) you have to choose very wisely when and how to mount your offensive. The AI will send its high hit-point defensive units to block your high-damage units, so you'll have to make sure you have a clear advantage. The AI is as smart and dynamic as a computer chess opponent.   Thankfully, the Pale Magic heroes' advantages make them interesting and challenging, rather than hair-pulling or depressingly easy, but I don't want to give anything away. Suffice to say you'll need to be very careful with what spells you cast, and keep a close eye on the upper left-hand of the screen that displays the enemy's active spells in a given round. You'll even need special spells that only affect Pale Magic units but are satisfyingly powerful.    Speaking of spells, their effects are all very colorful and generally enjoyable. Each hero will make quite a flourish while casting, and the effect will often wash over the whole battlefield. And while we're talking about graphics, I'm sad to say that, as far as I can tell, no visual improvements have been made to the tactical battlefield. Perhaps some higher-res terrains and increased character polygons, but you'd have to look at side-by-side screenshots to tell any difference. The animation is still high quality, with fluid attacks, deaths, spell casting, and idle motions while waiting for orders. But besides the Pale Magic creatures (who are quite bizarre and fascinating), you'll get no new units in this sequel. The backdrops of the tactical areas also don't vary much, and don't always seem to reflect the habitat of the strategic map.   Finally, the resolution is locked at 1024x768, which seems odd for a full-priced game this day and age. It still looked pretty good on a large monitor, and smacked very strongly of Warcraft 3 with its exaggerated buildings and cartoonish creatures, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.    If you like Magic: The Gathering and Heroes of Might and Magic, then you should get a kick out of thisif you're willing to devote serious time to an occasional, nonsensically difficult battle. Since the graphics are virtually unchanged, you won't need a beefy system, but as such, it doesn't feel like a sequel so much like a really big expansion pack that's eliminated some tedious micromanagement. If you're new to the series, however, and dig turn-based strategy, then this is a good title to grab. The variety and depth offered by the card game aspect ensures that combat won't get old, and hopefully Nival will consider toning down the regeneration saving throw.", "date": "Sep 30, 2003"}
