It tries different things, and...it gets atypical results. Take for instance, arcade-style 18-wheeler driving. Who would have thought that driving an 18-wheeler would be so much damn fun? In the arcades it's a visceral, horn-blowing blast. The steering wheel is heavy and stylized, the cabinet is massive, and the whole rig gives you the undeniable feeling that you are as close to driving an 18-wheeler as possible.    Bring that game home and you get a different experience. Acclaim brought the first Sega game of the series to the consoles, with a direct arcade port of 18-Wheeler, and for what it is, the game is a fun, if not quick, bubblegum rental. The whole experience of the big rig is missing, the cabinet, the screens, and physical sense of being in that truck is denied. Now, Sega offers The King of Route 66 on PS2, and it's, well, more of the same, mostly. An arcade experience softened for the home, with new modes, an enemy trucking company, and some cute Middle America queens to ogle over. But for the record, this game screams RENTAL.   Gameplay  At one point in the game, your narrator, a young blond woman says, ~Your love for the road has inspired everyone!~ And you're supposed to feel the American love flow through your veins. I can tell you this right off the bat, The King of Route 66 is more of a parody, a classic arcade take on American trucking culture than anything, and the caricatures are borderline hilarious/offensive. They didn't offend me, cause I know I'm a hick, but some trucker who looks fat, hairy, double-chinned, and who looks like a pine tree with legs is going get you Sega, and when he does -- WHAM! Right in the kisser. Just kidding, sorta...   The King of Route 66 delivers a slightly improved game than its predecessor, <i .18-Wheeler There are mode game modes which help to widen the experience of driving an wheeler but not necessarily deepen it.  And Route 66 blends in more of the skills that, in the previous game, were separated into game modes. For instance, the game's main mode of play, King of Route 66, works in little parking min-games and timing mini-games in between the larger, racing levels. There seems to be less parking in the game. Less ~serious~ stuff. The additional modes are moderately fun, but they're not exactly brilliant, nor do they deepen the 18-wheeler driving experience in the same way that, say, Virtua Tennis's training modes deepened the game 10-fold. They're funny and enjoyable on a boring, low-key afternoon, but they don't holler at you to run screaming out of the house to go buy this game.  The five modes of play include King of Route 66, a straight-forward arcade racing game with shortcuts, storyline, etc.; Queen of Route 66, a racing with game with the ability to modify your rig; Route 66 Challenge, a handful of mini-games, such as emblem catch, convoy golf, destroy the cars; a two-player mode, you against the computer or you against a friend; Rival Chase, stage by stage race across seven states in one straight shot with check points, and more. The ability to modify trucks is moderately good fun, though it's only good in one or two modes, and it's nowhere near as deep as in any dedicated racing title. It's not as big of a feature as it could be, either. There seems like no good reason that many of the ideas in this game, such as modifying vehicles, etc., could be weaved into the main mode of play, deepening that mode in the process.   The racing itself is the classic stuff of arcade racers. There is a certain amount of rubber band AI working here. It's better than in the last game (there is less of it), and some enemies will just flat out whip you to prove it. The enemy vehicles are brutal if you get close to them, and they don't drive fairly. You cash and it takes forever to recover. They crash, and they instantly recover and then instantly catch up. The key to the gameplay though is to never race a direct, fair race. It's all about cheating. Find the shortcuts, bash through buildings, cut off the opponent, and take alternative routes to get the win. Nobody ever said racing an 18-wheeler was pretty now, did they?  There are even massive jumps. Yep, insane nitro jumps that quickly replay your insane jump from three angles before you land. Ever jumped an 18-wheeler? Thought not. In addition to the jumps, AM2 has thrown in there lots of little pickups, such as road signs, nitro boosts, which are crucial to winning, and other little tidbits. Most of them boost your point total, and for what that's worth, they're worth collecting.   Filtered through the game is tacky, low-ball humor that no doubt will put a smile on your face, mostly because it's so consistently childish. And the humor, in many ways, carries the game's story. Old man Noisy Duck getting hammered over and over by the thugs from Tornado has its blunt, Three Stooges appeal. The various stereotype enemies and bosses you face are most definitely from the old school arcade design philosophy, which is to make fun of everything in a teenage manner. I enjoy it, because it's tongue in cheek and it's just silly fun, and because it borders on the inane, but some folks won't.   Graphics Unless you've been living in a closet for the last few years and didn't know, this series has never been about graphics. It's not a visually stunning game in any way. It's a kooky, funny looking game. For instance, the characters, like T-Bone, Cactus Joe, Lizard Tail, Big Foot, Danny Edge, they all show off an almost purposely un-synchronized dubbing technique. Their mouths move, while the audio comes out and doesn't match the animation. Heck, Sega could actually be doing this purposely and it wouldn't matter; actually it works well with the whole trucker thing they have going on, but it's just an example of where the rest of the graphics are at.   The game doesn't look horrible, but there is not a whole lot to say good about it either. There are a moderate amount of load times, very simplistic menus, and overall the graphics are just middle of the road. But again, the game is supposed to be a fun arcade game, and we all know that if AM2 wanted to make it the best-looking game on PS2, they very well could do it.   Sound Breaking it down technically, the sound quality is downright poor, the music is actually quite entertaining, and the sound effects range from slightly annoying to pretty good. The game produces this incredibly compressed audio that just hurts the ears, especially during the voice samples. That hurts, but like the rest of the game, since it's so tongue-in-cheek, it's difficult to tear into the horrible sound because of its low budget appeal.   The music is not country by its nature. It's more like Leonard Skynyrd style rock -- countrified hard rock, and I quite like it. The sound effects are real average. The game is worth checking out if you just like to hear stupid caricatures with hilarious voice-overs utter entirely predictable lines to one another. It's so budget that it's entertaining. So yeah, you might want to hear it for yourself.There's really not much left to say. The King of Route 66 is better in most ways than 18-Wheeler, thanks to numerous gameplay mode additions, customization aspects, and some cute country girls. And for a while it's funny, in its own cheesy, hick-like way. But that's it, folks.But ultimately, AM2's game is still a very shallow and an incredibly short one. I beat the King of Route 66 mode in about 1 1/2 hours (which technically is 1 hour more than the time it took me to beat 18-Wheeler). The rest of it will provide you with another four or so hours at most. So if you desperately feel the need to get this game, RENT IT FIRST.", "date": "Mar 19, 2003"}
