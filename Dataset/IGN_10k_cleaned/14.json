This machine was released around the same time as Pac-Man (and in fact, utilized the same arcade hardware Pac-Man did), and featured gameplay mechanics similar to that big, yellow, dot eater. Now, nearly two decades later SNK resurrects the game into an updated portable version for the NeoGeo Pocket Color that's bigger, brighter, and just has more ~stuff.~FeaturesClassic arcade action25 different mazesCharacter collection modeTime Trial mode for completed mazesLink cable support for two playersFor NeoGeo Pocket ColorFigure Crush Roller as a reverse Pac-Man. Instead of clearing a maze free of dots, you instead ~paint~ the maze a certain color. See, you're a paint brush, and to advance through the levels you have to maneuver through the maze, painting every pixel of the route. It's not going to be easy, though  there are a couple of bad guys wandering through the level trying to put you out of commission. But why is the game called ~Crush Roller~? Well, instead of power pellets like Pac-Man, there are rollers in the middle of the maze that can be pushed from one end to the other. If a bad guy gets in the way...splat! You have unlimited use of these rollers, but you have to watch it  every time you squash a bad guy, he comes back meaner and faster than before. You just better know the route you have to take to paint it all.The game also has a two-player mode. In it, you both work independently on the different versions of the same maze (you don't see the other player), and it's a race to see who can finish painting his level first. Whenever you crush an enemy, it sends a harder one on his screen, making his life a lot more difficult. Honestly, I think the two player element could have been designed a bit better, but this is a good addition nonetheless. The developers also added a Pokmon-style element into the mix  while you try and paint your level, there will be these annoying critters that will plop little treats (footprints, presents) to make your gaming that much more difficult. When you run your paintbrush over them, you've ~captured~ them into your library for future viewing. Can you catch 'em all? Honestly, this game is one of the most colorful handheld games yet released. Sure, the developers only utilized the primary colors for the graphics, but boy, they stand out. I'm always a fan of the classics  so I tend to play favorites whenever a company releases one. Crush Roller is definitely one of the NeoGeo Pocket Color games you just have to have in your collection  the developer didn't revamp the game in the least, only added to a great concept with new mazes. The classic gameplay is still there, and the team added a two player mode that, while seemingly silly and not necessary, adds a ~screw you~ element that's seen in puzzle games. Good stuff.  The only complaint: it's hard to see those little corners you might have missed in the levels. But other than that, great stuff. It's a great game that should be picked up.", "date": "Aug 12, 1999"}
