{"name": "Rocky", "name_review": "Rocky Review [PS2]", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/rocky", "text": "I have to admit from the beginning that I'm quite a fan of the Rocky Balboa movies. First shown to me by my boxing-loving parents as a small child, the critically acclaimed story of a down on his luck Philadelphia pugilist and his meteoric rise to the top has always struck a chord with me. If Rocky could accomplish whatever he wanted with nothing more than determination and heart, then what was stopping me from doing that very same thing? So taken in by the world of Balboa and his supporting players was I, that for the longest time I wanted to be a professional boxer. Though my few amateur bouts with the kids around the neighborhood was as far as I ever made it, my passion for the movies and the sport itself continued to grow. Even now in my mid-twenties I find myself quite the sucker for Rocky films. Whether I'm flipping through channels on the television or deliberately nabbing the boxed set from my DVD collection, no time is the wrong time for that particular brand of Sylvester Stallone action.That said, I was ecstatic when I learned that Rage Software had decided to bring that fantastic boxing universe into the realm of videogames. Not realized since the days of the Sega Master System and NES (there was also a Colecovision installment), Rocky had been missing from the home console market for nearly 15 years. The most obvious of all boxing licenses, it was a miracle to me that it taken this long to get made in the first place. Though nobody really knew why such a long period had passed I suspect it was wariness of how well a 1970s/80s franchise would sell to a ~new millennium~ crowd. In fact, It was that suspected weariness that almost kept Rocky from happening. As the original publisher thought to be handling its distribution duties, Majesco Inc., mysteriously dropped all news and evidence of its interest without a word. Luckily for boxing and cinema fans, Rocky was picked up again by Ubi Soft the week before E3 2002.Months later with final versions in hand, Rocky the videogame is finally complete. Available across all three major platforms (with some noticeable differences between the systems), the digital incarnation of one of America's greatest cinematic icons more than lives up the movies' legacy. Though the game is far from perfect and not without its share of problems and concerns, Rocky has still managed to distinguish itself as one of the best pieces of action-boxing software ever to be released.The ContendersIn the past versions of any Rocky videogame, the choice of boxers were pretty slim. Peaking with the Master System edition in 1987, Rocky was privileged enough to face three different opponents: Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago. The main event opponents for Rocky in the first four films, the three heavies were the only obstacles a young Italian Stallion wannabe could have. And though I never doubted that Rage would most certainly toss more competition our way for the current generation, I never expected the huge number of pugilists at my disposal when all was said and done. With a final tally of 30 different fighters taken from all five of the Rocky films, variety is no longer a trait that this franchise is in need of. Of course all the biggest name characters are in there --Clubber, Ivan, two versions of Apollo, and five different types of Rocky make up the core set of characters with plenty more where that came from. For the first time ever, Tommy Morrison's mullet-imbued prot?g? Tommy Gunn is among the selectable personalities as is the guy who Rocky knocked out in the beginning of the series, Spider Rico. Not to mention a long list of guys who were either seen for a split second or just mentioned in passing to fill out the rest of the roster. Whether it's Mac Lee Green or his suggested replacement Buddy Shaw from the first Rocky film, or the man who was crushed by a series of devastating left hooks courtesy of Tommy Gunn in the fifth installment, Union Cane, just about every fighter you can think of (with two costumes per slugger) has made a return. There are even a few joke characters thrown in for laughs towards the end, with everybody's favorite manager Mickey Goldmill and the Philadelphia landmark Rocky Statue available for combat.Sadly, the one character that we did want to see make the cut didn't: Hulk Hogan's Thunderlips. The role that helped propel the Hulkster to fame and fortune outside the wrestling ring, Thunderlips not only added an interesting dynamic to the cast of Rocky III, he also added some bona fide humor. As it turns out, the character was omitted from the final roster mainly because how many changes the developers would have had to make to the fighting engine to get him in there. With submission and grappling holds the meat and potatoes of Hogan's movie ensemble, the programming team would have had to rework the game entirely for just that one sequence. An understandable decision for sure, but it's still a choice I would have liked to have had. Extra WeightNot content with including 30 different fighters, Rage has also thrown in a plethora of stadiums and fight locations. The Chapel where Rocky first squared off again Spider Rico, the Spectrum where Balboa/Creed I took place, and the arena in Moscow are but a few of the many different stages you can fight within. Players can even go at it outside the bar from the finale of Rocky V. Strangely, two key locations (Mickey's Gym and the arena from Rocky II) cannot be accessed for an exhibition bout. Seen only in the CG finale to the Rocky II sequence, the ring that the fighters battled freakishly transforms into the same ring used for Rocky I. Available in the early builds we played a few months ago, it's a mystery as to why the Rocky II stage was completely left out. Mickey's Gym however, can be entered but only in the game's Sparring Mode.Speaking of Sparring Mode, it's a pretty decent attempt at teaching players the basics. Set up in a similar fashion to most fighting games, Sparring allows you to choose any character you like and face an opponent to try out your combos and special moves. While it's a useful feature if there's one combination in particular that you're trying to nail down, you'll ultimately gain a lot more experience if you partake in an actual fight than when using this option. Especially when you play through Movie Mode.Loosely based on the films, the Movie feature is where the single player game gets most of its value. Broken into five parts (each one representing a different feature film), the player must guide Rocky throughout each movie as he climbs his way to the final confrontation with Tommy Gunn in Rocky V. Each chapter is laid out exactly the same, with the Stallion facing three warm-up opponents before meeting that chapter's boss fighter. Giving Rocky 20 adversaries in all, you'll only face the same opponent once, (Apollo) and that's the way it was supposed to happen anyway. Part of the fun in this mode is seeing how Rocky's look transforms over the course of the movies and watching the CGI cut scenes that recreate some of the more popular moments from whichever sequel you're currently playing (which can be accessed again later from the Gallery Option).Should you decide to see whose the best of the fighters in your stable, you can also opt to take part in the Knockout Tournament. A round-robin event that pits 16 fighters against one another in a winner take all match-up, it's a quick way to change identities and meet a couple of random opponents to win a belt. Spread out in three different classes (Bronze, Silver, and Gold), each tournament is more challenging than the next with an improved set of fighters to choose from in each. Fun when played against the computer, it's an absolute blast when played with other people. A multiplayer selection that's sure to become the source of many a late night gaming party, this particular tough man contest is loads of fun. Should you just want to go one on one with another player of the CPU however, there's a standard exhibition mode in there too. Getting Strong Now!Although it's not a new feature to the Rocky videogames, the training that mister Balboa partakes in during movie mode is a mini-game in and of itself. Totaling five in all, mastering the five exercise sessions will make your hero an even bigger threat when he gets into the ring. And while it's true that you could just select ~auto train~ and let the computer give you an automatic five point addition to whatever statistic you like, getting in there and doing it yourself is not only a lot more fun, but can also yield twice as many attribute points.Allowed two training sessions per fight intermission there are five different skills you can work on: Strength, Speed, Stamina, Determination, and movement. Each skill is almost equally important, and unlike similar games like Knockout Kings can make a big difference in the effectiveness of Rocky's performance. I mean let's face it, in Knockout Kings, Strength and Speed were pretty much the only skills you needed to work on with the rest of the attributes available to you as a mere afterthought. In Rocky having a determined boxer is just as important as having a fast one, and finding the proper balance between all the skills is a must.That's not to say that Rocky's perfect in its execution of the various boxing skills however. Just like Knockout Kings there's still a favorable tilt in the direction of power and speed --while Movement gets the short end of the stick. The remaining two attributes though: Stamina and Determination are a lot more helpful than they first appear. Stamina for instance determines how many shots your player can take before running out of punching power and health, and high Determination makes it much easier to recover lost health and to get up when knocked down. And while your early opponents won't test those two attributes just yet, by the end of Rocky II they're your only chance at survival. It's a flawed system overall for sure, but it's still an improvement over the similar approach of Knockout Kings. Part of what makes it so superior is how those stats are raised. Rather than just assign a blanket amount of points to the skill of your choice, you actually have to work at it. Using simple timed button mashing techniques, the various types of training that Rocky participates in are a great deal of fun. My personal favorite for instance is the Punching Mitts. A simple game of reaction, it involves your trainer calling out a certain type of punch for you to throw immediately. Land as many punches as possible in the one-minute time period given, and you'll earn valuable points for your stats; it's simple, enjoyable, and more challenging than you think. Especially when trying out some of the more advanced games like the Rope Skipping or the Meat Locker.Ring SavvyAnd while I could talk about characters, training modes, and other such things all day long, the most important aspect of any videogame is how it plays. And thankfully Rocky really delivers. Set up in an almost identical fashion to EA's Knockout Kings 2003 getting into the action is pretty simple stuff. Head jabs and crosses for instance are handled with the top two face buttons, while the bottom two face keys throw the same punches to the body. Press up or down on the directional pad while throwing any punch for a hook, or hold down on the Right Trigger with a punch button for an uppercut. Blocking can be accomplished by holding the L-Trigger (for as long as you want, none of that one-second block mentality here), and by pressing both the Left and Right triggers together, you can perform a quick evasive maneuver.The mechanic works quite beautifully actually, and if you've played Knockout Kings before, should flow rather naturally within a few minutes. First timers may need a half hour or so to get used to it, with GameCube owners in particular needing a little extra time to adjust (as the layout of the Cube controller isn't quite as intuitive as the Xbox and PS2 controllers for the Left/Right, Left/Right setup).Part of what makes the system so effective is that it works equally well for both counter punchers and turtles. Don't get me wrong, this is an offensive game through and through, but the depth of strategy available to you is unrivaled in any other boxing game. Knowing ahead of time that any punch can be blocked (even a super punch), no matter where it is thrown or when is a great advantage that can promote more in-fighting than found in other titles like KO Kings or Black & Bruised. Those games in particular have a hefty arsenal of unblockable moves that when used wisely can tear even veterans of the game into pieces. Because of that ideal, a lot of the better fighters do most of their battling on the outside while hoping to avoid any of the close-up traps that can end your career in a hurry. In Rocky any fighting style can match-up and beat another fighting style. The only limit is the skill of the two opposing players. Don't be fooled by the bombastic fight choreography of the movies, the developers went for as real a boxing model as possible. As every videogame I've played before however, there were a couple of things that stuck out for me as bothersome. Two key facts in particular took away from the realism and potential of Rocky and hurt it in a way that I don't like to admit. The first is how easy an opponent the Artificial Intelligence makes. A joke at the novice level and moderately challenging on the contender level, you're going to have to switch over to Champ difficulty to get the most out of your CPU experience. Unfortunately, the majority of your opponents are susceptible to body jabs and uppercuts to the chin. Once you've gotten the computers approach timing down pat, it should be easy pickings for the semi-experienced player. Rocky was obviously meant to shine brightest as a two-player game.My second problem is with the scoring system. Not a big deal in computer-played games, the flawed judging technique takes away from the importance of power in a two-player contest. Achieved on two fronts, the fact that CPU will never score a round anything other than 10-10, 10-9, or 10-8 is incredibly annoying. As every boxing fan knows, a knockdown equals one point loss, and if you're knocked down twice in one round, the score should go to 10-7. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen and an extra knockdown will not get you an extra point. It may sound like a small gripe but it's actually pretty important if your bout goes the distance. To add insult to injury, the CPU scores a round by the amount of punches landed, and not damage inflicted. Which means if you land 31 power shots to your opponent and he lands 35 that were all jabs, he wins the round. I don't approve!Eye of the TigerGraphically, Rocky teeters in-between good and mediocre. The character models for instance are appropriately assembled, but there's a distinct square-like appearance to most of the fighters. More of a result of the animation than the figures, the boxers move in a stiffer fashion than I first expected. Not as fast or fluid as the many times mentioned Knockout Kings, I had to take notice of the sometimes robotic nature of the game's satin trunked gladiators. The textures however look great, and every boxer appears exactly as they're supposed to. Clothing, skin, and even specific facial lines that defined a personality in the film have been recreated to a tee, but it's the little details that really blew me away. In the original Rocky for instance, there was a sequence in the film where Balboa started hammering slabs of beef in a meat packing plant to improve his skills, and the game follows suit. Sticking Rocky in the very same sweat suit he wore in the movie, the heavy bag training mission is replaced by a beef slab mission instead --But only for the first movie. Other admirable tidbits include the stained glass window of the Virgin Mary in the Chapel stage to individual bits of street trash in the showdown with Tommy. What are even more impressive however are the pools of blood that form on the mat. Staying exactly where they land based on where they were created, blood will stick to the canvas permanently and get worse as the fight goes on just like a real contest.The true showstopper however is the facial damage. The best yet seen in any boxing game, cuts, bruises, swelling, and abrasions form realistically on fighters faces as the match progresses. Unlike most boxing games however, the injuries are not pre-scripted to appear after a certain round or just because it's late into the match. They appear based upon your actions. If you've spent the whole match going to the body for instance with only an occasional journey to the face, you may only see some slight swelling or redness around the eye. If you've been working the man like pizza dough however, his face will reflect it accordingly. Throw a lot of left hooks and the right side of his face will yield the most damage, and so on. The final effect is very realistic and should be a standard feature in all boxing titles by now.Unfortunately, the PlayStation 2 version of the game runs into visual problems that the GameCube and Xbox renditions do not: slowdown (and lots of it). A rare occurrence in the other two versions, the PS2 edition finds itself suffering from slowdown at the strangest of times. Land too many punches to your opponent's head for instance and the action will bog down slightly (apparently caused by all the particles flying into the air) and throw your timing off completely. Additionally, the action will freeze up occasionally when your foe has been knocked to the ground. And on at least three occasions with the Gold Master copy (the same master that's used for retail pressing), the screen froze after a knockdown. Only to un-freeze again when the character had recovered from the injury. Very strange, and it's PlayStation 2 exclusive. Oh and so is the fact that the PS2 version is missing Apollo's float entrance in the first film, the other two have it almost exactly.The Sound and the FuryAnother example of hit and miss, Rocky's audio track has its ups and downs. The up is most definitely Bill Conti's remixed soundtrack. Inspired heavily by the first two films, the tunes found within are the same familiar beats we remember when watching the movies all those years ago (or in my case, last week). It's a very authentic feeling, especially during the training menu with tosses out the famous ~Getting Strong Now~ theme song. I just wish that the producers could have nabbed the rights to the kick ass Survivor tunes from Rocky III and IV. Eye of the Tiger and Burning Heart were very important pieces to those movies, and it would have been cool to see them incorporated somehow into the action.At least the majority of the actors allowed their voices to be included in sourcing the FMV and sound effects. Sylvester Stallone, Mr. T., Tommy Morrison, and Richard Gant have all lent their permission to the sound team and have been incorporated into the game accordingly. Sadly, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, and Dolph Lundgren's characters have sound alikes that take just a tad away from the overall presentation. It's also kind of strange to see non-Mr. T. Characters like Burt Judge grunting with T's voice. I know the sound bank can only hold a certain amount of effects, but come on now. It's Mr. T!I did notice one strange bit in the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions in regard to the voice-overs actually. During the CG cut scenes in those games, the vocals appear to be drowned out in an almost echoed manner. Sounding as though they're in a far away cave, the audio quality of the cut scenes isn't quite up to the same level as the Xbox. Especially considering the fact that all three versions use Dolby Digital recording.If you're a multiple system owner, you may want to direct your attention to the Xbox version of the game. Slightly better looking and more responsive than the GameCube edition, it's the best way to go. Sadly, the PS2 rendition of the game appears to be rushed through development a bit. And in addition to the bizarre slowdown problems it has, also sports some rather hefty load times and graphical omissions the other two games don't suffer from. Despite my many nitpicks though, Rocky is in many ways the perfect boxing game. Capturing the spirit of the films more closely than few movie-licensed videogames before it, Rage Software's stab at the Italian Stallion is every bit a masterpiece that the movies were (trust me, it's already better than V). Though it definitely could have seen some improvement, particularly in terms of round scoring and CPU difficulty, there have been few boxing games yet to match this level of success. Joining the ranks of other legendary titles like Greatest Heavyweights and 4D Boxing, Rocky Balboa is very much for real and is Ubi Soft's best game this year next to Splinter Cell. Wait no longer -- run out and pick this baby up right now!", "date": "Nov 11, 2002"}
