Since BioWare / Black Isle's original Baldur's Gate hit shelves back in 1998, we've seen quite a few high quality games in the same vein. After titles like Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment released, BioWare put out the first Neverwinter Nights in 2002 which brought the sub-genre into 3D.  Though it offered online play and a powerful editing toolset with which users could create their own adventures, it stripped out a lot of the single player features that made the previous titles so entertaining. Four years later, Obsidian Entertainment, those behind Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, finally released the anticipated sequel.   The biggest change since the original is the inclusion of fully controllable party members. You'll meet quite a few during the single player campaign, all with their own inventories, equippable slots, and the ability to customize their skill allocations upon level up. This makes playing Neverwinter Nights 2 seem more like the D&D CRPGs of the past. Since we've seen this feature before, it really isn't a step forward, rather something that should have been included in the original Neverwinter Nights. Still, bringing this back makes the sequel a more enjoyable game to play.    Though the number of controllable characters will change during the course of the game, you're limited to three main party members in addition to your created character. They all come with unique alignments and personal histories, and frequently pipe up during conversations with NPCs. Depending on how you choose to go about completing a quest, playing the chivalrous hero or killing everything in sight, you gain influence with those you're traveling with. This affects what kind of information that can be extracted from party members during private conversations with them, and ultimately determines whether or not they'll stick with you. Some party members also have side quests you can choose to accept or ignore that involve working out whatever personal issues they may be having, adding alternatives to pursuing main quest.   From the starting town of West Harbor, it'll be a little while before you reach the city of Neverwinter. Once there, the plot picks up as your various adversaries are unmasked and you can choose a number of paths to move the story forward. The plot manages to stay interesting, buoyed by generally strong writing for conversations and the occasional witty quip. Neverwinter Nights 2 features a large amount of voiced dialogue, most of which will pass over your eardrums without inducing a cringe, and occasionally make you laugh along.    If you find yourself getting tired of charging through the main narrative, the available side quests are wreathed in enough side narrative to keep them from feeling like repetitive dungeon crawls. You'll also find plenty more to do once you're awarded with a stronghold; your own personal castle. Acquiring this property isn't a side quest, it's vital to the plot. Once obtained you can busy yourself with repairing its various facilities, hiring merchants to peddle wares, implementing tax rates, training troops, improving armor, strengthening the outlying area's infrastructure, and generally making your home more profitable. Like in the Suikoden series, recruitable NPCs are sprinkled around the game's various areas, so it's worth it to pay attention your first time through and remember who to return for. Some of the more exotic recruits include a blade golem and a giant spider who inhabit your basement.    Despite this variety, the crux of the Neverwinter Nights 2 experience is the dungeon crawl. Since all your party members are controllable, there's a significant tactical component to battles. Maneuvering rogues for sneak attacks, using fighters to taunt, casting protective spells with druids and offensive barrages with sorcerers and wizards is all part of the experience. By the time your characters hit level 10 there'll be a nearly overwhelming number of combat options depending on what party loadout you've chosen, and each combination is fun to toy around with.   As enemies are cut in half with bastard swords and fried with lightning, they'll drop items. Lots of items. Even in the beginning stages of the game, you'll find your companions' inventories reaching capacity. With reagents for crafting, magical and mundane weapons and armor, potions, scrolls, and wands scattered around on each character, it starts turning into a real pain to keep track of everything when it's split between 10 or more characters. The game lacks any kind of global inventory management system, so every time you go to switch a character out of an active party, you need to spend a significant amount of time swapping around items to make sure everyone's ideally equipped. It also doesn't help that there's no way to sort items within an inventory, meaning you need to pore over multiple inventory pages, adding yet even more unnecessary downtime to the experience. As it stands, the process of reorganizing a party, selling off excess items to lighten inventory loads, identifying everything, and making sure everyone's properly equipped cuts into the enjoyment of the narrative and combat.   Choosing what kind of character you bring into the game world is a rather complex process. Based on the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 rule set, players pick between 16 races, 12 base classes, and 17 prestige classes that are unlocked after special conditions are met. With a huge number of skills and feats to further customize your avatar, Neverwinter Nights 2's character creation system is one of the deepest around. Regardless of how you tweak all the details of your character, combat in Neverwinter Nights 2 seems too easy. Unless you've got the difficulty cranked to hardcore, a few area of effect spells are going to take down all enemies in range almost immediately even during boss battles.     Though there is variety in which side quests you pick up and which moral stances you take during conversations, the actual maps are limited in size and explorable area. It lends a strange linearity to a game that otherwise presents plenty of choice to the player. Moving around each area is easy enough with both a click M1 to move or WASD modes of character control. Whatever's happening onscreen is easily viewed by holding down M3 to adjust the camera, or using the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. As a result, you'll always be able to get a good view of the action.   On top of all the single player gameplay hours, Neverwinter Nights 2 offers online cooperative play as well. You can create your own room, password protect it, and play through the single player again with friends using your created character from the single player or fashioning a server specific one, adding quite a bit of replay. It's just a matter of time until we start to see what users are able to create with this game's tweaked toolset, which allows anyone who buys the game to create their own adventures. These can be loaded online and played through with others as well, giving Neverwinter Nights 2 tremendous lasting value.    The immersion factor created by the voice acting and narrative is augmented by a stellar orchestral soundtrack. Great battle music is complemented by excellent tracks full of moaning strings and ethereal vocals. Enemies scream and hiss during battle, spells crackle across the screen, and weapons clang against armor. Companion acknowledgements can get repetitive, however, as they call out a limited array of phrases whenever selected.   Neverwinter Nights 2 has some steep system requirements, which is somewhat puzzling given the graphical return. Character models range form plain to flat out bad. Some of the monster designs are interesting and the armor sets are detailed, but it's difficult to tell exactly what the game is doing that requires such processing power. Most of the environments are boring to look at. Even Neverwinter itself is dull in appearance, with repetitive housing designs and blocky, sparse interior spaces. The game only looks good when spells are being flung around, which are far and away the most attractive effect the game has to offer. Without spells onscreen, Neverwinter Nights 2 is a slightly above average looking game with an inconsistent framerate on most systems out there. Even on high-end rigs with all the graphical effects cranked, it still doesn't look very good unless bits of magic are flying across the screen.    While playing through we came upon a few bugs. Though none severely hampered our gameplay experience, they did ruin the illusion of immersion in a few cases. During a few of the letterboxed cutscenes characters had the occasional tendency to walk completely out of the frame, meaning we were staring at a wall while a conversation was going on. During others, characters would turn and address the wrong character. At one point while engaged in a text only conversation with an NPC, voice clips of a cut scene from a previous part of the game triggered every time we clicked on a response. We also encountered a few instances where cut-scenes didn't activate properly, forcing us to reload our game. The second time through, it worked.Anyone looking for a lengthy, complex, and engaging single player role playing experience should look no further than Neverwinter Nights 2. Thanks to the inclusion of fully controllable characters, there's plenty of enjoyable tactical combat to be conducted in the many dungeons the game runs you through. On top of that, there's an interesting storyline buffered by hours of fully voiced dialogue, an excellent soundtrack, good writing, and strong characters. The ability to play through the official campaign with others online in addition to the toolset that can be used to create and play your own adventures gives Neverwinter Nights 2 a bottomless replay value. It's not without faults. Inventory management will eat up large chunks of your play experience, the game is a massive system hog for minimal visual benefit, and you will run into noticeable bugs. You'll also find maps are limited in terms of their explorable area and aspects of tactical combat are occasionally undermined by the frailty of many enemies. Despite Neverwinter Nights 2's tendency to occasionally frustrate you, it remains an enjoyable, worthwhile, and lasting experience.", "date": "Nov 3, 2006"}
