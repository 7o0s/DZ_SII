After all, they're what we all grew up on - Space Invaders, Galaga, Raiden, you name it. However, quality shooters seem to be a rare commodity these days. They're all falling by the wayside of 3D games. Tetragon has rescued the shooter from an untimely demise and brought it up to speed with Nanotek Warrior.  Taking its cues from shooters past and present, Nanotek Warrior is every twitch gamer's dream. You pilot a nanocraft down a 'bond,' an ever-growing, twisting tube covered with obstacles and enemies that leap out at you from all sides. Your ship is capable of traversing all sides of the bond, both inside and out, and can jump over most small obstacles. And, in a strike of pure genius, Tetragon has even included rapid fire. How sweet it is.  What really sets Nanotek Warrior apart from the other shooters is the perspective. With the camera placed just behind the ship, the bond seems to go on forever. Spinning around the tube in either direction is a pure joy, with the vertigo-inducing spires spiraling all around you - it really has to be seen to be believed. The graphics are clean and bright, with nice lighting effects on the plentiful special weapons.  Nanotek Warrior may not set the world on fire, but it does right by the shooter genre. Twitch fans should definitely take a look.", "date": "Apr 14, 1997"}
