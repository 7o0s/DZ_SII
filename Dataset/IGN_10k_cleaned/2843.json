On the Genesis and Saturn, that game was Sonic 3D.  While everyone was shocked at the ~3D~ characters in the game, the gameplay was below the Sonic standard.   Enter Enclave.   The details are extremely well laid out and positioned.  It is also obvious that there has been a lot of time put into this aspect of the game as there are few games on the Xbox that have this much detail.  However, if you couldn't tell already, this game is plagued by some gameplay problems.  In the end, Enclave frustrated and amazed me in more ways than one.   Story   The great kingdom of Celenheim is entering dark times.  The legends tell of a great battle between the Dark and Light, where a lone wizard defeated the dark demon overlord, known as Vatar, thus saving Celenheim for what they thought was eternity.  The Light survived and flourished, rebuilding their society, as the Dark struggled for existence on the outskirts of civilized Earth.  However, the Dark have slowly began to gain more strength and power and an uprising is beginning to take place.  The Dark will try to reclaim what used to be theirs as the Light must hold on to what they rightfully believe belongs to them.  A struggle against good and evil will partake once more.   Gameplay   Enclave is on the right track to greatness, but major flaws set this game back from becoming a winner.   For one, the default controls are a bit sloppily placed.  I for one am not a fan of the right thumb stick button as a jumping mechanism.  It is often too difficult to jump and move at the same time.  There is an option to change it so the A button is the jump button, but even this doesn't feel right.  They should have kept the A button as the toggle through weapons activation and used the vacant B button as the jump button.  Instead, they mix things up two much and with only two controller options to choose from, you'll have to spend some extra time in order to learn these somewhat sloppy controls.   Another problem is walking down ladders.  This seems to be a problem in many games, but it is very frustrating in this game.  Some ladders are high enough to hurt you if you fall, but it seems there is no way possible to climb down those annoying ladders.  This could have been avoided with a little more love and tender care.   The artificial intelligence has some flaws, as well.  The friendly A.I., first off, is probably as smart as a pre-school student learning about shapes and colors.  One example is found very early in the game, where you must take a huntress with you on your journey.  She follows you and occasionally shoots the enemies you attack, but she shot me as well.   Also, each time I tried going through the level with her, she would always get stuck behind some barrels or other objects, or she couldn't move through gates without me going back to open the door that she was too slow to follow me through.   The enemy A.I. is cursed, as well.  They are graduating from the same school the friendly A.I. is, but at the bottom of their class.  The key to beaten the enemies is to go in for a slash and hack, then move out before they can even realize that they were hit and they need to strike back.  This makes the game ridiculous easy at times, until there are multiple enemies and the challenge increases.  The hardest part of the game is not to get frustrated by the lack of save points, which would have made this game a gazillion times easier.   The does include some bright points, like longevity.  There are two campaigns to battle through, the Light first and the Dark second.  Also, there are 12 playable characters to choose from, allowing you to use the best-fitted fighter for the particular mission.  There is a knight, huntress, wizard, druid, engineer, halfling, berserker, assassin, sorceress, lich, bombardier, and a goblin that are playable in Enclave.  If sword swinging isn't your style, it's time to pick up the staff and cast some spells on the suckers.   You can also equip your fighter with weapons, armor and what not before the battles.  Think you'll have to be a sniper?  Get a ton of flaming arrows.  Think the orc's will be swinging clubs in one big fighting frenzy?  Pick up your trusty sword (many types are included), and a strong shield to plow your way through.   The options menu is quite short.  As stated before, there are only two different styles of controllers you can choose from.  In my opinion, with the Xbox's power, companies should be able to let the gamers choose their own configurations.  Hopefully companies will take advantage of this soon.  The video option only allows you to adjust the brightness, the sound lets you change the volume of effects and music, and game options are for blood to be on or off and whether a damage indication is on or off.  As you can clearly see, the options are quite limited in Enclave.   So while the game does have set backs, the game does include some RPG elements, bloody but slow fights, and a somewhat entertaining storyline to keep you busy for hours.   Graphics   This is by far the strongest part of the game.  The details and models are quite nice in Enclave.   The walls are very finely detailed, where every wall and design seems to be unique.  While this is not true, the game does have very well designed castles, where moss and stones on the castle walls seem to capture the true feeling of a medieval kingdom.  The characters are also very well done, with scars, cuts in clothing, and blood marks found all over the characters skin.  Not only is the detail high, but also the player models are nice and smooth, giving them a very realistic look to them, rather than the box look so commonly found in past generation machines.  This game truly brings out the feeling of medieval times through its lush and finely crafted maps and objects.   Despite the games beauty, the animations are well below par.  The hack and slash animations are very repetitive, where the characters seemed to be limited to one motion of attack for their strikes.  It's nothing like the animations you'll find in another hack and slash game like The Mark of Kri.   Not only do the attack movements make me yawn, but watching the knight is one of the most odd things I have ever seen.  He throws his arm up above his head, and then runs in air with his legs flailing.  One might confuse this for attempting the triple jump at the Olympics, but when he only jumps two feet forward and one foot vertically, it was obvious that he might be the goofiest jumper of all time.  Things like this plague the game, thus hampering the overall visuals.   Despite this rant, the models are very nicely done, where very little jag is seen at all.  Add to that the fact that they are all gorgeously detailed, this game is one of the most visually stunning games for the Box.   Sound   Enclave's music sounds like generic-beat tracks played by a single man on a keyboard.  The score sounds over-the-top at times, getting increasingly climatic, only to disappoint when it starts to sound too much like a videogame again.  The compositions are complex and the different instrument sounds are almost limitless, but the music does not seem to fit this game that well.   Contrary to the music, the game's sounds are clear and magnificent -- especially for those who own a 5.1 surround system. The clashes of swords and shields are crisp and even emit a vibrating ring, the orcs sound ferocious, and the bricks falling from the ceiling crash as if clay were hitting the ground. The surround separation is excellent. The best way to describe the sounds is by imaging a coin hitting the ground.  When the coin first hits the ground that is what you tend to find in the lower tier games.  However, Enclave continues past that as the coin rattles on the ground.  The sound clips are very pure and crisp and are a pleasure to listen to.This game is a mixed bag.  While the game features stunning graphics, clear and realistic sound, and RPG elements to heighten the games longevity, there are some major set backs with the control, the A.I., the battling, and others areas that tend to be my pet peeves.  I seem to say this about all of the games that I review, but this is a rental first.  The fighting system and A.I. really irritate me, so it is difficult to say to go out and buy it.  It is, however, visually stunning and will greatly impress you during its first missions.  Rent it first and if you can get past the bland fighting and the terrible A.I., give this game a go.", "date": "Aug 9, 2002"}
