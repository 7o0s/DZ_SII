That, and the fact that the thrill of flipping through the air uncontrollably and landing on the wheels of your car in a spectacular stunt just hasn't been matched in any other racing game.  That said, I'm a bit disappointed in San Francisco Rush 2049 simply because while it's using the name of the Midway franchise, it really doesn't capture any of the elements that makes the series so unique and fun to play. The Game Boy Color version's developer was given the task to move the game from arcade to handheld, and obviously the 12-year-old hardware isn't quite up to the task of emulating the 3D-accelerated graphics and floating-point math-calculated physics. What I'm saying is, don't expect San Francisco Rush in the portable version of San Francisco Rush 2049  it's a rather straight-forward racing game borrowing the namesake. Features Nine tracks Five cars Time trial mode Password save Only for Game Boy Color  But if you just look at the game for what it is, it's a relatively fun little racer in the top-down style of games like Micro Machines and Test Drive 6 for the system. It's more positioned at a side angle to create a more 3D look to the graphics, which work pretty well  the nine tracks are very surreal and futuristic, and many of them twist under and over each other to produce the individual circuits.  The problem is, it looks like the graphics and track designers wanted to focus more on the futuristic element rather than the San Francisco location, so don't expect Lombard, Market, or Mission Streets to be portrayed here. There's no Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, or Transamerica building either  the game could have had any title attached to it, and probably would have benefited from that simply to reduce the expectations gamers might have.  The action is relatively smooth, but not altogether fast  the game's pace is dependent entirely on your ability to pick up power-up icons that will boost your car's speed for a second or two. The element of icon-collecting is integral to the gameplay simply due to the fact that if you don't grab them, you'll either run out of time, or not finish the race in the qualifying place. They're all over the place on all nine locations, so you'll have to do a bit of track memorization when you accidentally pass them.  San Francisco Rush 2049 has five playable vehicles in its line-up, and while the game's menu and the manual fail to mention it, each car has different settings. Some can stick to the road better than others, so if you choose your vehicle poorly from the get-go, you'll find yourself spinning out just from turning too sharply. I just wish the game had some sort of interface to show the strengths and weaknesses for each car.  And speaking of interfaces, the game has a really weird and annoying oversight  as you progress through the game's circuit mode, you unlock the next track as well as receive a password. Once the track is unlocked, you can race it in the Time Trial mode whenever you want  you just need to enter the password. Now here's the kicker  turn on the system and enter a password that will gain access to track number five, for example, it will only open up track number five  two, three, and four remain locked. You have to enter the password for each track if you want to open them up. And this gets rather irritating when you get to the final track, since you have to type in eight different passwords just to open up the entire game.  As far as top-down racing goes, San Francisco Rush 2049 on the Game Boy Color is above average  there's just not much in the way of options to shake up the variety.  You've got Circuit Mode that'll pit you against the computer AI, and Time Trial to race all nine tracks by yourself. But that's it  there isn't even a Vs. mode using the link cable. Compared to the console versions of Rush 2049, the portable version severely lacks variety -- it's good for a few spins around the year 2049, but don't expect the game to last into the future.", "date": "Sep 15, 2000"}
