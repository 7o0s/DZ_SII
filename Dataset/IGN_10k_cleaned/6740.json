Called Feeding Frenzy, this quirky title by Bejewled 2 and Zuma developer PopCap Games is focused entirely on gobbling marine life. You're not fishing, though, you actually play as a fish. The more you're able to consume in each of the game's stages, the more you'll grow. As you grow, larger and larger prey becomes eligible for snacking. Eating other fish gives you higher scores, and higher scores bump you up on the leaderboards.   The game isn't much of a challenge on both normal and Time Attack modes and there aren't any difficulty sliders. Both modes track your progress in the Frenzy Coast with 40 stages that progressively ramp up in difficulty. Later levels have way more fish, which means more opportunity to be eaten, as well as immobilizing jellyfish, poison fish that reverse your controls and explosive depth charges. The beginning of each stage is always the most difficult, since in addition to avoiding the aforementioned hazards, you also have to stay away from larger fish. If you don't, they eat you.    Feeding Frenzy's simple mechanic of eat, grow, and eat more turns out to be surprisingly endearing. It's too bad there isn't any kind of online support, then this game could have been much better. As it is, the package itself is too basic to keep you at it for more than a few hours. A few achievements for logging 10 hours of play time, eating 1000 sharks, and building your food bank to 40,000 require more extensive play sessions, but aren't all that compelling. Aside from that, Feeding Frenzy's only lasting appeal is the leaderboards.   The game itself, as limited as its appeal may be, remains fun. The game's many dangers are counterbalanced with numerous power ups. By the end of the game you'll be snagging shields and screen freezing bombs, an icon that lets you automatically wolf down any eligible onscreen prey. Speed dashes and limited suction ability are also at your disposal, great for inhaling any nearby groups of fish for the hefty school bonus. At regular intervals, your playable fish changes. Starting with an angel fish named Andy, you'll go on to play as a Lion Fish, an Angler and finally Orville the Orca.    There's nothing special about this game's graphics. They're big, bright and colorful, but you're not going to see anything spectacular. Not that you should expect to, considering it's an XBLA game. It should be noted, however, that despite the clutter of enemies, obstacles and powerups blanketing the screen in later levels, object distinctions are always clear. If you get gobbled up, you can't blame it on being unable to distinguish enemies. The sound can get particularly annoying, as sparse as it is. The ~Feeding Frenzy~ muffled voice that chimes in whenever you fill up your bonus gauge is not something you're going to want to aurally experience more than twice. Have a custom soundtrack ready when booting this title up.   Controlling your aquatic munching machine is as smooth and responsive as it should be, with the speed burst adding a little depth. Depth is definitely Feeding Frenzy's main issue. With such simplistic mechanics, meager challenge and lack of game modes, it's difficult to recommend spending your Microsoft Points on this one. It's got a sense of humor for sure, but in the face of many more robust and engaging XBLA titles, Feeding Frenzy falls short.", "date": "Mar 17, 2006"}
