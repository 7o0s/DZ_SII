Look at my RTS addiction. When it comes down to it, WarCraft III isn't that much different than any other RTS out there (except in quality control anyway), but I still enjoy playing it as much as Starcraft, Age of Empires, Red Alert 2, or any of the other good base building real-time strategy games. So when I played Pharaoh, I wasn't bothered that it was a lot like Caesar III, cause it was really good, it improved some things, and I love Egyptian history. Then Zeus came along. This time, they added more personal interaction with the gods and improved some more gameplay mechanics and was a terrific game, but it was generally still the same game as the first two. Now Impressions has brought its next city building game, Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom, to stores moving the series away from the Mediterranean and into ancient China. I thought that this would maybe inspire some more creativity and surprising new gameplay, but it didn't. Sure they added some new things like Ancestors (pretty much like gods), the Chinese zodiac signs, new ways of dealing with farming, and multiplayer options for the first time as well as the obligatory improvements to interface. But there isn't really anything here that we haven't already gone through in ancient Rome, Egypt, or Greece.   Now I'm not saying that Emperor isn't a good game. It is a great game. Particularly if you haven't played any of Impressions city building games before. If you haven't, and you've always liked games like SimCity, or RTSs that are heavy on the infrastructure, base building, and micromanagement, then you'd be silly not to. Impressions has built an incredible series over the years. I just think it's time to move on and go upwards and onwards like we all know they can. It's kind of like in high school or college when you start setting the bar, teachers like to see improvement and new things. We gamers are the same way. Stagnation is a sign that you're getting bored with your work and need to be challenged a little bit more. Impressions needs to challenge themselves a little more.   As I mentioned earlier, Emperor is the first in the series to take a step outside of the confines of Europe and Northern Africa and set foot on a completely new continent. When you think about it, China is a perfect civilization to base a game like this on. There's a ton of really interesting history to work with and much more than a fair share of technological, social, and spiritual movements over this areas long and tumultuous history. If you weren't aware, Chinese culture and tradition dates back farther than any other civilization on Earth, growing and changing little bits all the while, but maintaining a certain core that makes it so recognizable.   Unfortunately, this is part of the problem. For a culture that is pretty darn different than any of the European ~cradle of western civilization~ influences, it doesn't seem to operate a whole lot different than those civilizations in the ancient Mediterranean. Loyalty and honor doesn't play a large part in the game, trade and dealing with other cities seems to work basically the same way. You'll have to pony up some gifts in order to open trade with other cities to pay respects before trade opens up, but that seems to be about as deep as that goes.   Regardless of some absence of social differences, Emperor does travel through much of Chinese history with the historical campaigns. The game spans from the 2100 BCE (that's Before Common Era for those unfamiliar) to 1215 CE when the Magna Carta was signed and Ghengis Khan was wrecking northern China. You'll have to put up with the various designs and wants of the various Dynasties as you move through the game as they put you up to different tasks like creating new cities, building military forces, and constructing gigantic monuments and structures like Great Temples, Grand Canals, and the mighty Great Wall of China. As with all of the Impressions games, these monuments take forever to build, so you have to remember to start early or the scenarios can drag on for a long, long time.   The main focus of the games is definitely on the city building and management of the cities. While each of the games has had combat in it, it's never really been the focus of the game. In each scenario you begin either with an empty map, some buildings already in place by the computer or your hand (earlier in the campaign as you come back to your cities as you built them in some cases), and some objectives. These can include anything from attracting a certain number of citizens into a specific quality of housing, producing a certain amount of goods, completing one of those monuments, or any number of other things. Each of the scenarios will give you drawbacks and bonuses to work with such as the lack of certain items needed for increasing population density and so on.    Laying out and planning cities is much easier than it was back in the days of Pharaoh. Mainly because of the improvement made with Zeus and the elimination of the need for employment walkers. Basically this means you don't have to have houses near your industry sectors anymore. This is cool and all, but it also means that you can completely eradicate any slums. While it certainly makes your city look prettier, I'm not sure how realistic it is. With the addition of residential walls, you can completely enclose your residential areas from the blight of the fishing quays, clay pits, and dirty smelly iron smelters. Now they can live in peace and still work all the way across the map.   The introduction of residential walls also adds a new way to keep certain walkers from wandering off the beaten path. When you build one of these walls across a road, a gate automatically appears. If you right click on the gate, you can give choose whether to give access to building inspectors, market employees, and religious walkers. This gives you even greater ability to keep more buildings out of the confines of your residential areas as well as give these walkers access to more than one residential area of the city if you develop it that way. While this is cool, I still wish they would just let me paint the path I want each of the building's walkers to take if I wanted to. Steve and I have had this argument before; he seems to like the way it's set up. I suppose it does cut down one more piece of micromanagement, but its something that I'd like to be able to control. As it is, all of my residential areas tend to end up being circles so that I know each of the houses will be visited by all of the walkers. Being able to plan a route would be nice.    The better your houses, the more people they can fit in them which means the more employees you'll have for your use. Much of the time, you'll find that one or two loops of residences will do the trick for all of your citizen needs. They'll have everything they need to grow and prosper in one nice little area. And once you've stuck a wall around it along with some gardens and statues, the desirability of the area will be high enough that all of your people will be living in the lap of luxury and you'll have the rest of the map to set down your infrastructure, elite housing, administrative, and palace grounds.   Your basic infrastructure starts with the necessities. You'll have to have food first. Starving people are not a happy and rich people in my experience. You'll have the basics like in all of the other games such as the hunter huts and fishing quays to satisfy your people's meaty desires. After that you'll have farms, which have been rethought for Emperor. Instead of a set farm that has to fit in a certain area, you'll build a farmhouse and then plant the one square fields around it however you like. There's a limit to how far from the house you can plant fields, but this will allow you to fit your agriculture into strange spaces if you're in a pinch and have to make every square foot of the map count.   Aside from that, all of the functions are pretty much the same as far as industry goes. They just look different and have different names. But the functions are still the same. You still make cloth (hemp and silk), pottery, weapons, and luxury items (bronzeware, jade, laquerware, etc...), need health (wells, herbalists and acupuncture), entertainment, military, taxes... I could go on and on. Even some of the buildings look exactly the same such as the warehouses. The basics are almost exactly the same as you've had in the past and require the same attention and same techniques. Basically, if you've played any of the Impressions games, you'll know exactly what you need to do to succeed with minor changes.   Like the ancestors, for instance, which replace gods in Emperor. China comes along with four different religions that live and breath with each other in relative peace and harmony (probably mostly because their philosophy based and not faith based for the most part). Each of them requires a different building and walker, and once set down, will require some upkeep. Basically, ancestors are important to people. They're revered and believed to be with you always to steer you in the right direction and help you out when the need arises. Of course, this only will happen if you pay your respects to them in the form of material goods. So each of the religions comes with a new set of three ancestors that you'll have to keep happy by offering up goods. It's easy enough to do, just hard to remember. The thing is, as you bring more religions into your city, they other ones don't go away, so you'll soon have a lot of ancestors to please. And that means a lot of extra goods that could be shipped to other cities for profit. But in order to increase your city's splendor, you'll have to introduce more religions, so be prepared.   The great thing about these ancestors is that if you do make them really happy (which is easy if you've got extra expensive stuff lying around) they'll come and visit your city in person. They're represented by large distinct characters that you can actively control. Each of the ancestors has benefits while in your city. Some will help you hugely in battle by giving bonuses to friendly units, all have walker properties such as Zoa Jun's ability to act as a priest and add 1 delicious piece of food to every house he passes, some can bless certain buildings, some can catch animals for your menagerie at your palace, and some will even fight beside your soldiers in battle. Appeasing and attracting these guys to your city is a big thing and will help you immensely. The big downside to the ancestors is if you can't afford, or just forget, to appease them, they'll do some nasty things to your city like cause an earthquake that will knock a bunch of stuff down and cause you some serious delays in production.     All of these things are easily kept track of on the right panel of the screen with the various ministry information screens. There are 11 ministries to keep all of the information in groups you can understand and easily digest. Religion, entertainment, commerce, industry, government, monuments, population, agriculture, safety, military, and aesthetics all have their own necessary information for you to better run the city. The one thing that I wish the game had is warnings from the administrators that could pop up along the bottom of the screen or something in case you have a serious and immediate supply problem for something your populace has to have to survive and live. There have been times when I've been busy setting up some part of my city when all the sudden everyone has begun to leave because I forgot to turn my hemp production back on. A little reminder would do well for someone as easily distracted and forgetful as myself.   For all of its age, the engine Emperor uses is the same one that has been used from the beginning of time with minor tweaks and twinges to make things run smoother and look a little better. But the same engine it is and I think it's time for a new one. I don't know that the series should move to 3D... wait, I take that back, I think it should. At least something ala SimCity 4 to take advantage of today's basic computers and project a little more realistic life to the cities would be nice. Animations can be charming, but certainly move to the back or your mind after you've seen the loop a thousand times. Art in general is pretty nice in the game aside from that. I wish there was a little more variety to housing art however. Houses certainly look better as they improve, but need more style variety in those quality sets. By the time the houses get really nice, they're big enough and tall enough that you're entire population will look like it's living in tract housing.   Sound is much the same as the graphics. Once again, music is nice and soothing, but there needs to be more tracks, especially since you'll be spending a lot of time playing the game. Even soothing nice music can start to grate on you a little bit after hearing it too many times. And if you turn the music off, you're left with ambient sounds that aren't always there, sporadic building noises when you pass by with the camera, and sometimes complete and utter silence even though you're supposed to be stuck in the middle of this hustle and bustle of Chinese life. Clicking on buildings and walkers always gives a nice little sound clip, but there needs to be more to bring me into the middle of it all.    What did you think of Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom? The last major addition is the new multiplayer functionality. It's an interesting concept that could be fun but for one major thing. Nobody plays at the same pace. The game takes care of this by never letting a player get more than two months ahead of another player in time. But considering some people like to take their time placing buildings and mulling over the ministry information (each time pausing their game), this could suddenly go slower than a turn based game. Those that wish to brave it will find an unfriendly interface to joining and creating games. Once in, you'll be able to play both co-op and competitive. Co-op lets you and your friends pool resources to complete tasks and competitive pretty much puts you up against each other to finish the same task in the least amount of time. You'll have new options like being able to spy on your friend's city and take a look at his map in order to plan attacks better. Competing with different resources and ideas for planning is pretty interesting. It's a strange sort of game where you hardly ever directly interact with your opponent, but in fact interact with him like he's really sitting in his manager's chair in your rival city in China. I've already been going on for too long as it is so I'll leave it with this... While Emperor is a quality game, and therefore deserving of the score, it's virtually the same game that we've seen before making me just a little bit disappointed. I already know how to play and beat this game. Move on and up guys, we know you have it in you and I want some completely new stuff, not just tweaked and redesigned stuff with new art. That said, the formula is still addicting and those that couldn't get enough from Pharaoh or Zeus will certainly want to pick this up. And as I said before, those that think you might be into the genre are certainly missing out on a great gaming experience if you haven't played an Impressions game before. So at least check out the demo and try it out if nothing else. Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom  is definitely worth the look.", "date": "Sep 10, 2002"}
