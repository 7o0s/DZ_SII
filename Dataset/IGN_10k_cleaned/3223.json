The game features massive environments, quite a few game modes, some multiplayer action, an assortment of gadgets, and more. In the main single player story, players assume the role of Max Justice as he attempts to find out who's trying to steal the formula for Velocity X, a new fuel type created by Max's father.The Facts More than 45 authentically rendered Hot Wheels cars to race 30 missions through six huge, destructible worlds Speed through huge loops, catch air off jumps, rip through hidden shortcuts and run rivals off the road Features 15 offensive and defensive weapon power-ups Three different multiplayer modes to choose from Minor graphic improvements over PS2 version Connect to GBA Hot Wheels: Velocity X and unlock three cars No progressive scan supportGameplayThe game has a number of single and multiplayer modes to select from. Single player modes include Adventure, Challenge, Drag Race, Battle, and Joyride. Joyride lets you pick an unlocked level and drive around to your heart's content with no time limit. There are hidden items in the Joyride mode that you can find to unlock cars, and it's useful to get used to some of the areas. Battle mode lets you fight deathmatch-style with up to three other cars. Drag Race is a short race on one of the tracks. You can set up how many cars you want to race, how many wins you'll need, and whether you can use gadgets or not. Both the Drag Race and Battle modes allow you to play with two players.The bulk of the single player game is in the Adventure and Challenge modes. Adventure follows Max Justice and his family through their attempt to recover the Velocity X formula and find out who's behind the thievery. Each level has a set of goals that must be completed, with the story unfolding between each mission. Most levels first require something along the lines of getting to a checkpoint, getting to a second checkpoint, and destroying a few cars somewhere along the line. There are also a handful of races scattered throughout, and a few other types of goals to break up the pace, like protecting another car from destruction, or collecting a set of items.The Challenge mode sets you up with a series of goals that you must accomplish, and you're able to win a few new cars and tracks along the way. Some challenges are simply to beat a certain stunt score, make it to a checkpoint, or collect a bunch of items before times runs out. They'll throw in a few tweaks to the norm from time to time, like you might be penalized for hitting orange barrels, or you might need to continue to collect stopwatches as you race or your time will run out.Controlling the cars can be cause for a great deal of frustration, and is probably Velocity X's main flaw. They use the common gas, brake and handbrake setup for the basic controls, but getting most of the cars to turn in a decent manner is futile. Without braking, the cars will turn a little more sluggishly than in most games, but the problem is trying to use the handbrake to power slide. It's nearly impossible to cause the cars to slide around turns, and using the handbrake actually barely helps improve the turning radius at all without completely slamming on it and losing most of your speed. The game becomes overly frustrating when needing to make tight turns, as you'll either need to slow down a whole lot in order to take it, or ricochet off the outer wall. The cars will also try and correct the turn when you attempt to slide, so at the end of a large brake your car will often turn back a little to counteract the slide, and you won't end up going the direction that you would have liked. As much of an arcade racer as this game is trying to be, the cars just don't handle like it.The control issues extend to causing the missions to become quite boring, if not frustrating at times. Since it's impossible to maneuver the cars in any sort of manner resembling fun, the missions come down to just another goal where you must fight against your car's handling to finish the goal. Even the missions where you must take out a few other cars become tedious, since the control scheme restricts how you're forced to fight; for example, making U-turns is always a struggle. Even as nice as the game tries to dress them up, most every goal is either getting to a certain point on time, collecting items, or destroying other cars. This basic formula is fine if it's actually fun to drive, but here, they're just more things that force you to fight against your car's handling.Being as this is a Hot Wheels game, it wouldn't be complete without its share of flips, rolls, loops, and ramps. The levels are scattered with these tools of recklessness, so the game actually stays fairly close to the Hot Wheels style. Cars can also perform stunts while airborne by rotating and flipping, which will score you points as well as boost. The left analog stick will cause the car to rotate, while L and R will make the car roll. The problem with the stunts is that after flipping and rolling once or twice, you'll have seen just about all there is to see as far as stunts go. Being as they're cars, they can't really do much else besides roll and flip, but the stunts provide such little variety that it's really only exciting once, if even that.Aside from ramps and loops, there are also half-pipes and other vertical areas that you must maneuver during races and some of the challenges. Vertical racing doesn't help the control problems at all, and it introduces some camera issues as well. The turning radius is pretty abysmal while on the ground, but trying to turn while driving up a wall is possible cause for insanity. The cars handle like a rock while vertical, but some of the challenges require you to collect items on a wall while also trying to make a U-turn quickly to conserve time.The camera also has some serious issues while driving vertically. The camera shifts to such an angle that it's hard to see what's coming up in front of you, so you'll often find yourself missing a needed item by inches, or running into the side of the exit. Needless to say, if you have anger management issues, make sure no family members or animals are around while playing this game, especially while using a wireless controller.Besides driving, flipping, and cussing at the controls, you can also attack other cars in a few ways. Pressing L or R while not airborne will cause your car to skirt sideways and bash any vehicle next to you. You're always welcome to just ram other cars, of course, but this hurts you as much as it does them. The game also has a vast assortment of gadgets that you can use for destructive purposes. A few are of the self-improvement variety, such as booster rockets or armor repair, but most are offensive weapons. Many are gun-like and fire forward from your vehicle, like the Laser Cannon, Atom Blaster, or Freon Bomb. Some other weapons are more of the area-effect nature, like the Sonic Boom. The weapon list is pretty decent, and they all work well enough, but you'll still be fighting against the driving controls to line up most of the weapons for a shot. The turning radius makes it hard to get a car in front of you at close range, so you'll find yourself either backing out quite a bit to get situated for a shot, or just sticking with an area-effect weapon that you don't really need to aim.One last major gameplay issue is with the game's arrow system. Like many other games, there's an arrow at the top of the screen that is supposed to point you to where you need to go. The arrow in this game is very flaky and often points in the wrong direction, even if the goal is right around the corner. There are many times where the arrow will point one way, you may turn to go that direction, and then the arrow will just change and point somewhere else. It's best to use the arrow as sort of an ~average~ thing, and head to where it's usually pointed at, as opposed to where it might be pointing that very second.Overall, Hot Wheels: Velocity X is just too clunky and improperly executed upon to live up to its potential. The thrill of driving all these lovely Hot Wheels vehicles around in twisted up environments, far more elaborate than any kid has ever seen, was very real, but in the end it just didn't come together right.GraphicsThe graphics in Hot Wheels: Velocity X look pretty outdated at this point. The cars look like they fit right into the Hot Wheels universe, and I'm assuming that they're all real Hot Wheels cars that you can buy in the store, but they look fairly bland within the game. That's not to say that their design is bad; they all look pretty cool as far as that goes, but they aren't textured in a very detailed way. What reflection effects and so forth that the cars have don't stand out, and coupled with the fact that they're mostly just one color, they end up looking fairly flat.The track textures are pretty boring also. They're about the most basic set of textures you can choose from, and placement is pretty repetitive. The levels do happen to be quite large, though. It takes a couple minutes to drive from one side to the other, and depending on whether or not sections are blocked off, there are plenty of different ways to get from place to place. You also won't notice any pop-in, and the draw distance is about as far as you should be able to see.The large levels lend to the game's biggest graphical problem, though. The game is bogged down by quite a bit of slowdown, and it can sometimes get pretty bad. Some areas you might only notice a small dip in the framerate, while in others the game will slow to a crawl and pretty much hinder any sort of control you had over the game. It's also not entirely predictable as to when the game will slow down, either. Some areas will be notorious for slowing the game down, while in others it'll seem to happen ranomly.SoundThe game's sound is pretty lackluster, and it almost seems like an afterthought. Engine sounds are uninspired and generic, and they don't exactly sound like the engines in any of these sports cars should. Every car seems to use the same engine sound, although the pitch is shifted up or down a bit on each car to provide a very small bit of variety. You would expect that a hot rod would sound much louder and more powerful than a bus, but this isn't the case.Crash and weapon sounds are equally mediocre. Slamming into a wall at both low and high speeds provide the same boring crashing sound. The one sound that gets very repetitive and annoying is the air-wrench sound that plays whenever a menu item is selected. You'll wade through a few menus options every time you race, so this sound will likely start grating on your brain after a while.Hot Wheels Velocity X Maximum Justice is almost a fun game, except that its controls really hold it back and kill any enjoyment that might have been had with the game. It's too hard to keep speed in corners, or at least take them properly without crashing into the wall. There are a couple multiplayer modes, and a fairly large number of cars and weapons to unlock, but once again, the controls get in the way and you can't really enjoy using any of them. The stunts were also intended to play a large part of the game, but after seeing your car flip once or twice, that gets boring as well.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
