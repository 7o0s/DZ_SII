There you have it. That's what's wrong with ESPN NBA Basketball. Okay, there are some other things too, but nothing that stops it from being crowned the king of the courts, the cream of the cream of the crop, the best basketball game of the year. Besides, that's what online roster updates are for. This is one of those games where the more you play, the more you appreciate the little things.   Jason Kidd blows a kiss into the air before a free throw. It may seem insignificant, it might even seem silly, but J-Kidd does it in real life, so now he does it in the game, and it just adds so much to the air of reality that surrounds the hardwood. ESPN NBA Basketball features the best looking player models of any 5-on-5 basketball sim ever made. Every face (not just the stars) of the NBA, all the tats inked up and down the arms and legs of your favorite players, and every player animation you can think of from the pro hop (contextual, not a button) to slam dunks that are now highlighted by player collisions and bodies crashing to the floor.   But ESPN NBA is not all flash without the cash, as you can bank on gameplay that features both a realistic pace and more wide open spacing to let the runners run, gun, and throw down the jams. Shooters can shoot, passers can pass, and defenders rise up in the face of a throwdown and throw it back down to the floor. Then there's this whole other mode. Yes, another gameplay mode that has nothing to do with the NBA or 5-on-5. It's called 24/7, and it enables you to create a baller from scratch, build up his skills, and take to the streets to challenge the best street players in the country.   24/7. If only you had that much time to actually play the game. Now that would be hoop heaven.    Gameplay  The NBA 2K series has always strived for realism over arcade play. It was more about playing the game like the pros rather than trying and shake-and-bake all five defenders in hopes of getting to the rim and delivering a tomahawk jam like in most other games. This year, the gameplay still remains based in the sim arena, but it has definitely added a touch of the arcade element, opening up the floor a lot more for fast breaks, alley-oops, and ankle-breaking moves, while at the same time, not sacrificing the overall realistic tone of the game. It's more of a payoff for making the right move.   In years past, you might deliver a perfect feed inside to an open man, only to be less than impressed with a two-foot jumper. This year, you can actually throw the alley-oop at will, toss a flashy lead pass behind the back or over the head to a cutting player, and the contextual animations, from reverse layups to the pro hop, add more razzle to your dazzle rather than leaving you hoping for more. But you can't talk about ESPN NBA Basketball's improved gameplay without talking about their new IsoMotion controls. IsoMotion is a game of cat and mouse between the ball handler and his defender. It's like Rock, Papers, Scissor with hundred dollar kicks, thousands of fans screaming in your face, and millions of dollars on the line.   A quick summary of how it works: The player with the ball starts his move by using the IsoMotion controls. The defender switches to IsoMotion defense and attempts to hop in front of the man with the ball in order to draw the charge. Seeing this, the man with the ball can quickly cancel his move, and as the defender jumps out of position to draw the charge, step back and hit the open jumper or juke back the other direction and try to penetrate the lane. Like we said, it's cat and mouse because the defender doesn't necessarily have to switch to IsoMotion, can make the dribbler think he's going to try to draw the charge, and then wait for the step back and swipe at the ball for the steal. At the same time, every match -up depends not only on pressing the buttons at the appropriate time, but also takes into consideration each player's attributes, making it easier for players like Iverson to leave a defender in his dust, while Big Ben Wallace proves why he's best suited on the defensive end of the floor.    When it comes to gameplay, though, there are a few things that were featured in NBA Live 2004 that could've made ESPN's gameplay run even smoother. The first is the separation of the shoot and dunk buttons. Playing Live and then moving on to ESPN, you really miss calling your own shots, or dunks if you will, as anytime you are given more control, that is a good thing. The second gameplay addition only featured in Live is the use of the pro hop button. In ESPN, there are pro hops, but as we mentioned, these are more of contextual animations rather than anything you are controlling. The pro hop button in Live helps ball handlers split defenders and create separation on the way to the hoop, and combined with IsoMotion, could've been a deadly gameplay weapon. Oh well, there's always next year.   One cool gameplay element that was added is the new free throw meter. The meter forces you to use the right and left triggers to line up two sides of a circle and then hit the shoot button as a ball scrolls up and down the meter. Hit the button when the ball is in the middle of the two sides of the circle to form a complete ball and sink the bucket. What's cool, though, is the fact that the player on defense can hit the trigger buttons on his controller to make his opponents controller actually shake as he tries to shoot the ball. It's just another one of those small touches added to the gameplay that add up to a whole lot of fun.   In terms of other gameplay features, ESPN features the ability to adjust your lineups before the game, scramble starters, and even participate in a fantasy ESPN-style draft, just like you've seen in other games like ESPN NFL Football and ESPN NHL Hockey. The game is online for both systems, although the PS2 online experience is by far the better of the two as it features leagues similar once again to ESPN NFL Football. In addition, Franchise mode has also been improved by enabling you to hire scouts, assistant coached and trainers to help your squad, and this year the computer teams will even offer you trades. It's about time. We just wish they would've included in-game highlights of other games going on during your season like they did in ESPN NFL Football.    But even without that, the game is so deep that even if playing in as your favorite NBA team was all there was to the game, ESPN NBA Basketball would still be worth buying, as it's the best 5-on-5 NBA experience money can buy. But that's where the folks at Visual Concepts kept running, and in doing so, beat all of their competitors down the court for the slam dunk.   Out of virtually nowhere, Visual Concepts introduces 24/7 mode, a mode where you not only play the game, you are the game. Living the life of a baller 24 hours, 7 days a week, the goal is to create your own character, outfitting him with clothes, sunglasses, tats, and maybe a throwback, and then send him into training to increase his b-ball skills. Once your baller is ready for prime time, you can then check the schedule that uses the real-time clock from your gaming machine, and depending on what day and time it is, not to mention your player's location on the map, you'll be presented with different challenge games. The games start out as one-on-one contests with certain rules like no jump shots or no steals, then as you progress and beat the NBA players on their own courts (sometimes in their own driveways), they'll then hook you up with their cell phone numbers so you can give them a call later on and ask them to help you out if your encounter a two-on-two game in your area. You'll also encounter a series of bosses, ala NBA Street.   The more you win, the better your baller becomes, and the more items you can unlock. After a while your player might be wearing a backpack or even a hockey mask, and since each item is unlocked in a certain location, you might need to play all of the locations at all of the times if you're searching for a specific item, hence 24/7 mode.    If that wasn't enough, you can expect to see some really cool specialty games on the weekends that you otherwise wouldn't get to play, and Visual Concepts even plans a holiday surprise for ballers who'd rather ball than celebrate the good times with their families. You will also be able to bring your player online and compete against other 24/7 characters. This will enable you to see what other goodies people have acquired and spur you to play even more of the mode so you can have all of the latest and greatest gear.   Graphics  The player models are incredibly detailed, from the actual tats on the bodies to animating cloth on their jerseys and shorts. The player models themselves have also been refined to include thinner legs and ankles than last year's tree trunk thighs, their arms are shorter and feature improved definition, while the faces are accurate down to Nick Van Exel's eyebrow. More attention has also been paid to the real head coaches of the NBA so Phil Jackson looks more like Phil Jackson than Freddy Jackson (although I would settle for Janet).   ESPN NBA also features an all new animation system that not only helps speeds up the action, but brings another level of realism to the court by adding more player collisions, especially on dunks. There was one play where Amare Stoudemire actually kneed Theo Ratliff in the back of the head as he rose up for a slam, knocking Theo to the floor as Amare finished the play, and it was the first time in a while where a game made me stand up and shout about how dope the play was. And the kicker is, I was Theo Ratliff.   For those with high-end TVs, you'll be happy to learn that ESPN NBA supports 480p and 720p on the Xbox, while it only supports 480P on the PS2. The game looks incredible, though, and you'll really want to check out the player details at the highest level possible.   Sound  One of the major disappointments in the game, the announcing plain stinks. I'm a big fan of Tom Tolbert on the air in real life, but the way his voice is pieced together with play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald is no where near as smooth as it is with the Live announcers. All the sounds of the game are in there, and delivered in Dolby 5.1 for the Xbox and Dolby Pro Logic on the PS2.Not only is the gameplay tight, but the addition of 24/7 mode adds a whole new level to the term ~must buy~. The players look as perfect as I've seen in a sim so far, plus the new moves of IsoMotion help set the pace for a game that combines skill, strategy, and old-school button press fever.Sure, the addition of a pro hop button and the separation of the shoot and dunk buttons would make the game all the better, but even without those features, ESPN NBA Basketball is still overall the best playing basketball game this season. For the first time, basketball fans have an excuse to be playing a game at four in the morning. It's 24/7, the life of a baller. Forget Jon Robinson. The life of Jrob Andsteal has now begun. See you on the courts.", "date": "Oct 22, 2003"}
