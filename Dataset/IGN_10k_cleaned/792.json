In fact, I'm probably going straight to hell just for thinking it, but here goes: The N64 version of Battletanx II: Global Assault (while the titles share the same subtitle, the actual number tacked onto Battletanx differs) is actually better than the PlayStation's. One of the biggest gripes I have with the N64 is the control (and the controller, but that's a completely different rant), but Battletanx on the N64 is actually playable, even fun. The PlayStation version, on the other hand lacks nearly any redeeming value. It's insanely difficult, (even on the easiest setting), the tanks move like an elephant ballet, the sound is flat, and the level designs are weak. In a word, Global Assault sucks.   While GA doesn't necessarily feel like a rush job, it does feel like it doesn't belong on our lovable gray brick, either. Everything from the N64 version has carried over, albeit with a slight hit on graphics and framerate, but for some reason the game just doesn't have any oomph.   Gameplay When I heard 3DO was doing a port of Battletanx, I was a bit excited. Now let's get something straight: I hate N64 games. I think they look like crap, sound like crap, and play like crap. In fact, I can count on one hand the games that I actually like, and Battletanx, amazingly, is one of them. While the single player was a little flat, the multiplayer was a complete blast. The levels were almost always wide open, and allowed for some great blasting. Entire buildings could be leveled with a few cannon blasts, and the variety of weapons kept things interesting. The PlayStation version has most of this, but once again, it just doesn't hold the fun for some reason.   ~So what's the friggin' point of the game, Sam?!~ You ask. Well, my friends, it's a fun one! In a nutshell, the X-2 virus wiped out most of the female population in 2001, and as a result, women are a precious ~commodity~ that are used for furthering the species. Because of their low numbers, women are revered (see, women, you get your respect, it just takes a cataclysmic virus that nearly wipes all of you out first), and are held up as QueenLords. Now the men, freaking out because they can't knock boots like normal, form groups, the aggressive ones called ~Gangs~ and the more peaceful variety called ~Tribes~.    You are Griffin Spade, and you're wife/flaxen hottie, Madison, is the QueenLord of your San Francisco-based Tribe. Through the opening CG intro, we find that your son, Brandon, is the target of one mean she-bitch who wants him for some unknown reason. Early on in the game, you're forced to move east (and I don't mean just the eastern US, you'll travel to Texas, Washington DC, London, Paris, Berlin, and finally Russia), all the while trying to figure out who this woman is, and what she wants with your son.   Global Assault's biggest problem is the control. If you make a fast-paced game about tanks duking, er blasting it out, you'd better make the tanks agile, and 3DO has once again, screwed it all up. These tanks, while mobile forward and backward, turn like they're underwater, and since most attacks tend to come from the sides or behind, you spend far too long getting tagged while you're turning to face the enemy, and more often than not, meet your doom in the process.   When you can actually spin around to face the enemy, GA's stock of weapons leaves you with a bevy of ways to deal out the pain. Swarmer missles, mines, flame throwers, bouncing betties, guided missles, plasma bolts, and the all-powerful nuke all offer fantastic ways to deal the hurt. In all, 25 power-ups can be snagged throughout the single and multiplayer games. They range from the aforementioned weapons to simple defensive tools like cloaking, teleporting, speed boosts, and even The Edge (an offensive/defensive weapon that, with practice, will allow you to control enemy tank drivers' minds). With the amount of thought put into the amazing number of powerups, you can see why Battletanx could be fun, and indeed is on the N64, where it should have stayed.   Graphics Obviously, the PSX version of Global Assault is not going to look as good as the N64's , but that doesn't mean it can't look good. I swear 3DO shares the same color palette and textures with all of their games, because Global Assault bears the same tired, grainy textures as most of their other games. They're black-, brown-, and green-heavy, and while that fits here, they still look like crap. The explosion effects are decent, but they're nothing you've never seen before, and the game can become a slideshow when a couple of tanks and a few explosions are happening on-screen at once.   That's not to say Global Assault is horrible to look at. The destructible buildings are a nice touch (a few well-placed muzzle blasts from your steel beast will level quite a few of them), and the nuke looks just as good as it does on the N64. The tanks show deformation as they're damaged, and the variety of tanks is nice, but not really effective in avoiding the same tired turning problem.   Level designs, especially the multiplayer ones range from open and firefight-heavy to enclosed and a source of constant wall-bumping and opponent-finding. This sort of flip-flop from good to bad is annoying and won't create any fans of the series.   Sound Battletanx's music is actually pretty good. It's a hard mix of metal rock and good beats, and often fits the level, and with the PlayStation's increased storage space and CD-ROM media, there could be room for quite a few more songs, but I really didn't hear anything different.   The effects on the other hand, are dull as you can get. Where are the huge, booming blasts from the muzzle of your cannon, or the metal-on-metal crunch that befits a multi-ton rolling hunk of steel? Well, they sure as hell aren't here. Here, you'll find weak putts from the peashooter on top of your tank, and small thumps as you roll over the smoldering burned-out shells of your enemies. It's just not interesting, or imaginative, or aurally pleasing.  Bottom line, this is just a game that shouldn't have been done on the PlayStation. If 3DO can get their butts in gear and step up to the next-gen power of the PS2, we might actually see an enjoyable game from them on the PlayStation other than Army Men: Air Attack. Had the control and sound effects been addressed early on, we could have seen a game that offered a handful of guys a great blow-em-up party game that was a total blast. This is just a dud.", "date": "Mar 18, 2000"}
