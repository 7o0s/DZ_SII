Can videogames convey social and political messages and still be a lot of fun?  The answer, of course, is yes.  It's just that in an industry so focused on technical accomplishment and razzle-dazzle, it's rare when all that style meets some very real substance.  With Beyond Good & Evil, we've got one of those rarities.  And it's a darned good time, too.   In one sense, it's easy to describe Beyond Good & Evil, the latest game from Rayman creator Michel Ancel. Its core game play is very similar to recent Zelda titles, especially the generally excellent The Wind Waker, with puzzle-laden ~dungeons,~ vehicular transport to different parts of the game world, an intuitive combat system, and even heart containers. Add to this plenty of stealth levels, hovercraft racing, classic shooting sequences, and even some platformer-style elements (though somehow without the frustrating jumping). Then wrap it all up with a sophisticated story involving rich characters in a vivid, beautifully realized game world. Quick summary? It's Zelda for grown-ups, without the annoying fetch-quests.   The Story . . .  You play as Jade, a spunky 20 year old scraping by as a freelance photographer.  Her home, the island city of Hillys, is under attack by a sinister alien race, the DomZ.  Hardly indifferent to the war, Jade has taken in a group of kids whose parents have been lost in the attacks.  Jade and the orphans share their lighthouse home with Pey'j, a portly half-hog, half-human.  Pey'j is essentially Jade's adoptive uncle; he's raised her almost from birth, her parents mysteriously disappearing years ago.   As far as the people of Hillys know, their only defense against the DomZ attacks is the Alpha Section, an elite military force apparently fighting valiantly against the aliens.  Soon, though, Jade learns about the IRIS network, an underground organization working to prove that the Alpha Sections are not at all what they seem.  It's not long before Jade is recruited to help IRIS expose a massive conspiracy and try to put an end to the war.  She and IRIS will have to counter the Alpha Sections's propaganda, spread by a corrupt media, by disseminating evidence of the truth.  Along the way Jade learns that the deception is even deeper than she had imagined.    . . . And How It's Told  Beyond Good & Evil is essentially an action-adventure, as Jade travels to different locations and speaks with a variety of characters in order to gather photographic evidence and expose the truth behind the Alpha Sections and the DomZ.  Her basic tools include her dai-jo stick -- a simple but effective melee weapon, light discs for ranged attack, and her trusty camera.  Jade's camera is a central part of the game, as not only is it used to complete assignments and gather evidence, but it also features a scanning function to reveal information about her environment.  Metroid Prime haters, never fear: the scanning here is instantaneous, and far more helpful than frustrating.   Through most of the game, Jade has a friend with her, whether it's the charmingly gruff Pey'j (whose genuinely funny banter with Jade is one of the highlights of the game) or Double-H, an IRIS operative and gentle parody of sci-fi action hero cliches.  Not only are both characters well developed, offering clever remarks and helpful information, but you'll also rely on them to solve various puzzles.  There's another Zelda parallel here, obviously, but thankfully, Pey'j and Double H have far more personality and charisma than a bird-girl or a talking leaf.  Rather than feeling like yet another item to be used, as Zelda's companion characters did, Jade's cohorts are active, lively characters with minds of their own.   Beyond Good & Evil's mix of disparate game play elements would seem to invite disaster, or at least incoherence.  As it turns out, it all succeeds rather brilliantly.  You'll be doing plenty of combat on foot.    Jade's lithe with her dai-jo stick, and pulling off combos or back-flips is intuitive and fluid.  Sure, this isn't a deep fighting system, but it's far from the shallow slash-fest it might have been: it feels just right for the game.  Enemies aren't all the same either, and just slapping everything with your stick won't always get the job done.  There are several boss characters, and what they may lack in dramatic hugeness they make up for by putting up a good fight.    Jade gets from location to location using her hovercraft, along with a second vehicle appearing late in the story.  Both can be upgraded with new functionality, and are equipped for combat, making for some classic shooting sequences.  You'll even have a chance to enter several hovercraft races, both for cash prizes and as key moments in the story.  Ordinarily this kind of thing would feel awkward, but these action sequences play very well, thanks to tight controls and smooth integration with the rest of the game.   Similarly well-handled are various stealth levels, where Jade must crawl and sneak to avoid being sighted by heavily-armed guards.  Again, this could easily have become a point of frustration in the game, but instead the stealth sections become refreshing variations on puzzle design.  In many cases, you can choose whether to use brains or brute force in getting around the guards, with both methods often quite challenging.  And while these sections can be difficult, they're rarely frustratingly so, with solutions being clever and intuitive rather than obscure.   Just as intuitive is the game's interface, which is nicely integrated into the game world.  Scattered around the world are M-Disk consoles, which serve as both save stations and readers for the information discs Jade collects.  Items Jade collects are scanned for storage by Rinaldo, her sassy, multi-lingual pocket computer (and another of the game's colorful personalities).  The inventory screen makes examining items and sharing them between characters easy, and even a code-entering interface used at different points in the game is handled with flair.    In so many other ways, BG&E steps nimbly around pitfalls that would have sunk many other games with so much ambition.  The in-game camera almost never gets in the way.  Continue points after Jade dies are placed to maintain challenge without much frustration.  Surprisingly for a game with such extensive use of NPCs, I never had Jade get cornered and trapped behind a wayward Pey'j or Double-H.  Puzzles are tough without being arbitrary.  And, thank all that is holy, there are no repetitive fetch quests.  (You will have to chase down pearls, a black-market currency, but doing so involves fresh levels to explore, not backtracking or random hunting.)   While Michel Ancel's story may teeter on the edge of heavy-handedness, it manages to be both less profound and more successful than the premise suggested.  The themes of military and media corruption are surprisingly sophisticated and relevant, especially for a videogame, but the story doesn't offer quite as many ambiguities as you might expect.  It does ultimately work, however, with unexpected developments and plot twists popping up at just the right times to keep you interested right through the end.   A Breathtaking View . . .  I haven't yet mentioned one of BG&E's most obvious strengths.  The game is beautiful.  It's shimmering and detailed and fluid and gorgeous.  Detailed shadows dance up cavern walls, the waters of Hillys ripple and reflect in detail, cities teem with vehicles, pedestrians, and floating video screens, and it all runs with very few hitches.  The framerate did drop now and then, but this was rare, and never got in the way of game play.   The game's good looks aren't just technical prowess, however.  Character design and animation are fantastically fluid and life-like, which goes a long way in making the characters so believable.  Hillys is populated by humans and animal-human hybrids, making for some inventive folks, such as the Rasta-style rhinos who run the local garage.    The game's world is itself full of character, with a consistent and consistently imaginative look.  The art style of the game is cartoon-like while still feeling tactile -- fantasy that's neither baroquely flamboyant nor simple kid's stuff.  You'll see vibrant Asian-style interiors, ancient mines covered in luminescent plants, and alien landscapes.  Light, shadows, and fog are used well to add atmosphere (and in stealth levels, become critical to your strategy).  The whole game runs in letterbox format, adding to the already cinematic presentation.  Few games achieve the level of all-around visual deliciousness that BG&E has.   Almost matching the quality of BG&E's visuals is its sound.  The obvious stand-out here is the voice acting: it's great that the game features such sharp writing, but it's even better that the lines are delivered with so much style.  The game's background music is also excellent, ranging from reggae to electronica to symphonic cues (check out the bangin' song playing in a bar, with the chorus, ~it's just stupid propaganda!~).  Sound effects work very well, and have a real sense of location even with only two speakers.   . . . While It Lasts  If there is any real problem with Beyond Good & Evil, it's that the whole thing wraps up in about 10 to 12 hours.  To some extent, given its grand themes, one might expect the game to stretch to epic length -- though to be fair, the story comes to a satisfying conclusion without feeling rushed or scattered.  Perhaps a bigger part of the disappointment, though, is that, like a good novel finally finishing, the characters and story are so compelling that you won't want your time with them to end.  That's a very good thing to be able to say about a game, regardless of its length.    It's easy enough to tally up Beyond Good & Evil's accomplishments in game play, level design, and outright eye candy, and declare it a success.  But there's something more here to which all of these technical and design accomplishments are only a means to and end.  You see, BG&E is one of those rare games that shines from all points with an unmistakable quality of intelligence and personality.  It's in the sharp writing and excellent voice acting.  It's in the constantly inventive yet believable world of Hyllis and in the story's intriguing twists and emotional impact.  Or in little details, wonderfully presented: Pey'j and Jade leaping into an embrace after a big fight, or Jade's face registering pity and horror with the subtlest change of expression.  It's one thing to create a game full of pretty graphics and big action; it's something else to give us a story worth caring about involving characters we believe in.Ultimately, for all its similarities to Zelda, this is where Beyond Good & Evil finds its own ground.  Not only does it avoid many of the frustrations of the games it draws from (and yes, that includes Zelda's flat story and tedious item-chasing), but it is pierced throughout with humor, intelligence, and humanity.  While it's over a bit before you'd want it to be, Beyond Good & Evil tells its story with amazing pizzazz and polish.  Even better, it's a story well worth telling.", "date": "Nov 12, 2003"}
