In all directions towers and spires pierce the sky, the structures kept in low orbit by great jets of flame emanating from their undersides. An uplifting choir chimes in as Samus steps from her ship, the melodic sound of harps further emphasising the ethereal atmosphere. Moving inside, Samus finds herself in halls that curve away with the rounded structures. Small maintenance droids flitter about performing meaningless tasks in this rich, dark, steampunk environment. The rooms glow a luminous green from lighting pods along the walls, and every surface is richly detailed, whether from small architectural flourishes, or ornately patterned surfaces.   This is Skytown, perhaps the most beguiling location in Samus' latest quest. It's a triumph of atmosphere and aesthetics, a stunning demonstration that great art design is more important than raw processing nous. Skytown is just one of the cities you'll visit in Metroid Prime 3, but coming, as it does, around eight or more hours into the adventure, it demonstrates just how measured Retro Studios' latest game is. Even eight hours in, after some incredibly satisfying gameplay and stunning environments, the team still has the capacity to knock your jaw to the floor.     But let's backtrack a little. What's Corruption all about? In many ways it's very much a sequel, continuing to explore the insidious power of Phazon, while presenting the gamer with a delicate blend between exploration, puzzle solving and combat. On the other, it's a reinvention of the Prime series. The controls are brilliantly implemented, making the player feel like they're inhabiting the suit of Samus more than ever, while the gameplay is - at times - less solitary than before, thanks to a through story that works well to flesh out Samus' world.   Indeed, Metroid Prime veterans will be in for a bit of a surprise when they boot Corruption up. The game opens on a space cruiser, where Samus and several other bounty hunters have been called to help out the Galactic Federation. A virus, seemingly of Space Pirate origin, has been unleashed on a number of Aurora Units - AI entities that control the vast computer networks of both the space cruiser and several Federation cities. The networks have been taken down, and it's up to Samus - along with some help, to bring them back online. Without wanting to give too much away, Samus and the other bounty hunters are infected with Phazon (a highly radioactive, destructive ore), which leads to the creation of the PED suit to allow Samus to harness its power via Hypermode. In this state she's incredibly powerful, but stay in it too long and she risks becoming fatally corrupted. We won't say any more, but suffice to say that Corruption's story has a more epic scope than previous games, and sees Samus journeying to several very distinct locations.   Unlike previous games, in Corruption you start with a number of abilities intact. From the very beginning Samus can use Morph Ball and double jump, and new abilities are discovered regularly as you play. While many of the upgrades will be familiar to veterans, there are a number of important changes. Beam and missile upgrades now layer on top of previous ones, meaning you don't have to switch between different modes, and Samus gains a couple of grapple upgrades throughout the game as well. As mentioned, Hypermode is very much like playing with fire - it can help you quickly take down enemies and indeed is necessary to use against several bosses, but it's a double edged sword. At best you'll lose health, at worst your life.    Of course, the biggest change to Samus' abilities is the way they're unleashed. The new Wii controls represent a fundamental - and fantastic - change. Suddenly, you are Samus. You're using the Nunchuk to grapple enemy shields then ripping them off with a backwards tug. You're punching in security codes and pressing touch pads using the Wiimote. Hell, you're even Morph Ball jumping with a little flick of the wrist. Aiming is buttery smooth too. While you can't execute a 180 spin the way you can with a mouse, the system is far far superior to most console solutions. Better still, when you're locked onto an enemy you can still move the reticule around the screen, meaning that you may be locked on, but it's still up to you to hit the target - or another target nearby.      We really can't overstate how intuitive movement and aiming feels now, even taking into account the fact that it's slightly awkward to fire missiles (down on the D-pad) and to change visor modes (the minus button). Hitting the weak points on a huge stone boss just feels that much more satisfying now, while Retro deliberately challenges your new aiming skills, with enemies like the robots that fly towards you in a grid, lowering their shields one at a time.   Like previous games, one of the joys of Corruption is the methodical way in which the world opens up as you gain new abilities. It's expertly measured, and nicely signposted, meaning that you're never left wondering whether you can interact with something. Instead, you'll likely just make a mental note to return once you get that Grapple Swing/Plasma Beam/Sonic Screwdriver.    Corruption features a lot of backtracking, but it's never a chore, as the environments are so compelling and the evolution of Samus' abilities so organic. This really is a first person adventure game, as opposed to a first person shooter. Exploration and puzzle solving are fundamental to the gameplay, and we really enjoyed just soaking up the atmosphere in almost every area we moved through. That's not to say the game is slow - the pacing is spot on, with the frequent bosses and mini-bosses giving the game a steady action rhythm. While the bosses in particular are a little on the easy side, combat rarely grows tiresome. Morph ball sections also serve to break up the gameplay nicely and it's truly a joy to control Samus in this form, especially when you're running through the various pinball-esque runs in the game.   And as always, the ability to scan enemies and significant objects in the environment is a masterstroke, not only fleshing out details of the world without ramming them down your throat, but also functioning as an optional hint system. Stuck in an area and not sure what to do? In general, a scan of the area will provide you with the clues you need.   Theres a huge amount to talk about with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, but weve deliberately been a little light on the details because this is a game thats all about discovery and atmosphere and best experienced first hand. The important thing to take away from this review is that Corruption is the finest first person title on the Wii to date, with brilliantly implemented controls, great art design and great gameplay. A worthy new addition to the series.", "date": "Nov 9, 2007"}
