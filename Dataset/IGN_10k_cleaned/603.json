From Creative Carnage, the programmers behind Extreme Paintbrawl (ugh ... run away, run far away) and Extreme Mountain Biking (one of the better Extreme games ... but it's still not good), Extreme Rock Climbing proves that the Extreme franchise is getting better, but it's still not up to a level we'd call ~fun~ yet.    Extreme Rock Climbing's biggest downfall is something that all of the Extreme games suffer from -- lack of gameplay variety.  There are only four ways to play: Practice Mode, Free Climb, Capture the Flag, and Solo Mode (where you climb without the aid of any ropes).  While climbing up the side of a mountain didn't initially sound like the most enjoyable concept for a game that I had ever heard, I do have to admit that I was happily surprised by Extreme Rock Climbing ... at least for ten minutes.  That's the time it took me to conquer the most difficult cliff face in the game after I opened the box.  Ten minutes?!?  Is that as challenging as this game gets for $20?  Sadly enough, yes it is.   The control system in Extreme Rock Climbing will be very familiar to anyone who has ever played a golf game.  As a matter of fact, when I first started playing the game, I couldn't remember if I was supposed to hit a golf ball up the face of a cliff or climb a mountain.  And although it's the first Extreme title I've played that actually mixes up the gameplay with a little mouse and keyboard action, it's still an incredibly simple and basic control system which gives you little of the real feel of rock climbing.  Here's the basic premise ... You move your hand cursor over an area until you find a hand hold you can reach.  Push the mouse button and your energy bar rises allowing you to determine how much effort you want to put into the move.  Push the mouse button again and the bar falls to the bottom of the scale.  Push the mouse button once more as it falls within the green accuracy area to determine how precise your grab is.  Not a bad system over all, it's just extremely simple, and the bar moves so slowly that it's almost impossible to not land in the green accuracy area, even if it's an incredibly difficult hand hold.  And to make matters worse, the hand holds don't always match up with where you originally placed your hand cursor, so you may or may not end up where you thought you would.  It's as if Ray Charles and Jeff Healy programmed where the hold positions were in this game, because they don't always correlate with what you see on the screen.  Speaking of what you see on the screen, Extreme Rock Climbing is one of the best in the Head Games arsenal, but that's kind of like saying one baboon's butt is prettier than another baboon's butt.  Except for the jagged edges the character models look good enough, but the natural textures look just plain horrible as compared with other modern games, and the texture seams are so apparent that you'll wonder if the walls are going to come crashing down while you're climbing them.  This matched with the fact that all of the natural textures are extremely pixelized and blurry confuses me as to why exactly this game requires 140MB of hard drive space and 32MB of RAM.  I played better games back in the 80s on my C64 with a tape drive.  I do have to hand it to the marketing team at Head Games.  They're still the best at procuring eminent licenses for their titles, and I can only imagine that they have a big banner over their desks that reads ~Big Names for Crap Games.~  They've made deals with everyone from Mountain Dew to Justin Boots, Crosman to O'Brien.  Well, Extreme Rock Climbing isn't one to break the mold.  There are PowerBar ads plastered all over this game -- on the flags, on the menu screen ... hell, you can even buy PowerBars to give you that much needed boost of energy when you need it the most.  Just like in real life, a PowerBar lowers your heart rate and gives you enough energy to continue the climb after you're completely exhausted.  Well, there is one positive thing I can say about Extreme Rock Climbing -- it proves that things are on the up and up for the Extreme franchise.  Why, at this pace, the Extreme series will be utilizing circa 1996 technology in only a few years time.  What an age to live in!   -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
