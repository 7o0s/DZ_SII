It's been almost four years since Ubi Soft and Digital Eclipse worked together to recreate the hero's career-launching videogame adventure on the brand new handheld as Rayman Advance. Since then, Ubi Soft's Montreal team wowed gamers again with an even more stunning side-scrolling adventure that was so good, the company skipped the numbering continuity and simply called it Rayman 3 in order to coincide with the release of the console version.  Two years after Number 3, Ubi Soft and Digital Eclipse has once again paired up for a Rayman adventure, this time a completely original experience that's meant as an official sequel to Rayman 2, which just so happens to have just been retitled and released on the Nintendo DS platform as Rayman DS.. The new game, Rayman: Hoodlum's Havoc breaks from what makes many of the Ubi Soft hero's adventure's great: this GBA game's nothing special, and not nearly as fulfilling as the previous games have been on the Game Boy Advance. Hoodlum's Revenge picks up right after the end of Rayman 2/Rayman DS and sets the limbless hero on another quest to save his gigantic frog-like friend Globox. This time, however, even though the two are separated, players will be able to control both Rayman and Globox in different situations, and each character has a distinctly different style of gameplay in the same environment.  For this sequel, Digital Eclipse has employed its very capable isometric engine it created for the team's Spyro the Dragon series and its two sequels on the Game Boy Advance. This engine has also been used for other Digital Eclipse games such as Tron 2.0, and that's really Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge's problem: instead of feeling like a Rayman game, it instead plays exactly like past Digital Eclipse isometric platformers. If you've played any of the Spyro games from the developer, you'll recognize the exact same token and gem collection, as well as the jump, float, and attack mechanics. The ~lock on enemy~ control has been lifted out of Tron 2.0's design for long-distance attacks, but overall this game feels a heck of a lot like the three Spyro games created by the same development studio. It even looks the same because of the fantasy setting.  But even with the ~me too~ feel of the design built off of successful games in the developer's past, Hoodlum's Revenge has a lot of frustrating elements that weren't as inherent in past games of this design. There are a lot of ~instant death~ situations in this game due to the designer's insistence that water is deadly to Rayman. The developers were a lot kinder in previous isometric platformers during these situations by automatically rescuing the protagonist when players accidentally stumble off the edge. But most likely to keep with Rayman's tradition of incredibly challenging game design, the developers don't do this in Hoodlum's Revenge. And as a result, it's this element that significantly brings Rayman's fun down.  And where the Spyro series offered a lot of variety in level designs through mini-challenges, Rayman misses this boat almost entirely. The ~variety~ comes from the playable Globox and his distinctly different control style; he's more ~stealthy~ which means players will have to sneak around in order to get through the level, otherwise if he's seen Globox will break from the player's control in order to stomp around in a panic away from the enemy. Only by drinking plum juice can players actually attack with this big lug. These levels are pretty rudimentary compared to the Rayman-based levels; they're made to shake up the variety a bit, but in practice they're forced limitation designs that just make you wonder why someone so huge lacks similar abilities the main hero himself. Eventually the two pair up in the same level which shows why they're distinctly different in control, turning the game into almost a Lost Vikings design...but far less creative.    Still, the game isn't all that bad because of it's overall foundation. Digital Eclipse clearly knows the fantastical world of Rayman, and the team at least tried to give Game Boy Advance gamers a feel for the series' move to the 3D design. But the implementation is underwhelming because it really feels like a recycling from other non-Rayman games that the team was involved with creating on the GBA system. Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge is certainly a challenging platformer on the Game Boy Advance, but it's not as fun as it seems like it could have been. It's a significant step backwards not only from the outstanding Rayman 3 on the system, but also the development studio's rather impressive conversion of the original side-scrolling platformer back in 2001. It's really just pulling assets from other, more successful Digital Eclipse game designs, which strays from the Rayman feel since the limbless guy usually gets something special in his videogame outings.", "date": "Apr 29, 2005"}
