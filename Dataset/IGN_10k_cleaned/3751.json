For the uninformed, the two companies partnered together in a unique deal that let THQ publish Sega brand titles for the Game Boy Advance, whether or not these games were developed by Sega. See, in this deal THQ could also handle the development of Sega GBA games outside the ones that Sega was handling itself. Games like Sega Arcade Gallery, Virtua Tennis, Altered Beast, Jet Grind Radio and  Space Channel 5 were among this batch of titles, and they all ran up and down the quality spectrum. Space Channel 5, the last of the Sega/THQ games, ends the deal in a bit of a fizzle, because the game just isn't suited for the Game Boy market very well at all. The development team's efforts were a little half-hearted as well; the game features a decent rendition of the Dreamcast's soundtrack, but the graphics aren't very impressive and the storyline's nearly impossible to understand without prior knowledge of the console original. Features Four levels, 18 stages Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  The game is based entirely on the design created by one of Sega's internal development studio the Dreamcast. Space Channel 5 is nothing more than a Parappa the Rapper-style game of musical Simon Says, set to very groovalicious music. Players assume the role of Ulala, intergalactic news reporter who's grabbing the story of the century where aliens are invading and taking hostages. The only way to stop this invasion is to battle them in a dance...Ulala can really shake her groove thing. Aliens will spring out of different areas and challenge Ulala with a dance pattern set to the beat of the background music. Patterns can be a simple matter of repeating moves such as ~Left, right, left, right,~ but the challenge increases when the music picks up and the aliens start hitting half-beats with their moves. Not only that, but you have to use two different shoot buttons during the dance; if the aliens should ~chu!~ in their pattern, you'll have to press the fire button during your turn during the dance sequence...either the A button to shoot an alien, or the B button to rescue a hostage.  Sounds easy but it honestly isn't, since you really have to keep in time with the music when you're entering your commands on the D-pad and the buttons. The Dreamcast game had a bit of a lag problem in this regard, but it allowed a few mis-times here and there during the player's sequence. On the flipside, the GBA version is hyper-sensitive with keeping with the beat; there's no leeway given by the system. If you miss the beat, you've missed that sequence. And it's this hyper-sensitivity that makes the game a challenge to beat, which I suppose is a good thing considering the design's incredibly short with its four levels.  But it's not just the slightly unfair difficulty that's the problem. It's that this game really feels like a sloppy conversion. Admittedly there's no way in hell that the Game Boy Advance can do what the Dreamcast version did on that system; on the console, the designers cleverly matched up polygonal characters on top of a full-motion video background that both moved in sync with each other. Not exactly the most friendly technique to pull off on the GBA hardware. So, the developers reduced the polygonal characters to extremely framey sprites, and changed the flowing backgrounds to still bitmaps. The result is a very clunky presentation that doesn't look anywhere near as unique or technically impressive as the console game. And what's worse is the storyline presentation that's unfolded through absolutely awful text boxes that make it next to impossible to tell who's actually talking at that particular moment. If you've never played the Dreamcast game, good luck trying to figure out just what the heck is going on.  At least the music sounds nice coming out of a system without a dedicated audio chip. The team recreated the recorded Dreamcast music as instrumentations on the Game Boy Advance. While not exactly of the same quality, the tunes do the job to drive the gameplay, and it at least doesn't discourage you from using headphones. Space Channel 5 poses a challenge, sure, but it just doesn't seem worth it on the Game Boy Advance. The original Dreamcast game was good (but admittedly not ~AWESOME!!!~ like our Dreamcast editors rated it back in the day), and this GBA port just feels thrown together; the gameplay's there, sure, but Space Channel 5 was also about style and presentation...something that just didn't come through in the portable rendition.", "date": "Jun 28, 2003"}
