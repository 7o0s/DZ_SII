Plush leather interface, air-conditioned graphics, ample room for extra cars, hidden tracks, and bells and whistles -- what's not to love?  ~Isn't it pretty?~ would say the first salesman to sniff you out on the show floor. ~This year's model has fantastic new features that make it a must have for any driver,~ he'd make sure to add as he slipped you behind the driver's seat. ~We're talking more cars than ever -- that's a great dollar value! Nineteen tracks standard! Now tell me, where can you beat that?~  Get the shiny beast on the freeway though, and you'll find that though it runs nice, it feels a lot more like a station wagon than a sports coupe. Need for Speed has an unfortunate EA curse -- it's pretty, it's slick, but it's nothing new. This is certainly not a step down from NFS III, but at times it's hard to differentiate between the two, despite some appealing new additions to the formula.  The biggest change is the new career mode option, the main focus of High Stakes. Instead of simple winning races to get the fastest times, career mode focuses on winning cash and prizes to become the best racer in the world. You may not have to take first place to move on to the next circuit, but you'll certainly be feeling the pain for not being the best. Take a first place trophy, and maybe you can ditch that BMW Z3 for a 911 Turbo. Have a bad circuit, and you may be scraping together the funds to fix that broken bumper and those squeaking brakes while your cohorts upgrade to the beautiful Mercedes CLK-GTR, or the Lamborghini Diablo SV.  Competitions in career mode are broken up into three different flavors: Tournament, Knockout, and High Stakes. Tournament is what you'd expect -- a series of races where your job is to burn the bad smell of rubber into your opponent's faces, while cruising to the in-game techno/trance/bum-pa-bum/el generico sounds (we'll hit those tracks later). Knockout mode ups the stakes a bit (ah, see where the high stakes thing comes from? Eh? Eh?) by taking out the last place finisher ever race, until the last one left standing at the end of the tournament is the winner. The high stakes mode adds an option for those with the guts to risk it all. If you've won enough to purchase a second car, you can have a one-on-one race with one of your vehicles and a competitor, winner take all. Not bad, huh? Just don't be kissing any guard rails, Mr. Andretti, or you'll be biking it banana seat-style back to your garage.  For those without the patience to tackle the marathon career mode, a single race option allows you to jump right in and spin some wheels on any of the opened tracks and cars. You'll have to do some winning and grinning, however, if you want to take a peek at the three bonus cars, or one of the 12 extra tracks. But enough about instant gratification -- what about the hot pursuit mode? Like in NFS III, you can race on special tracks as either a civilian or a police officer, but now there are a few additional options to expand the playability. Getaway mode forces you to survive for as long as possible without getting caught (or times you on how fast you can catch a speeder, as a cop), and time trap forces you to finish a certain amount of laps without being caught by the fuzz. As the man, you'll have to put the iron fist down on those joyriding yuppies before they finish their race, or cause any major disasters on your highway.   It all sounds good, doesn't it? The EA team added a lot of new options to give the game a dense feel, which is great. Unfortunately, start a race and you'll find that not all that much has been changed. Controls with our force feedback racing wheel felt a little imprecise, and oddly enough, a keyboard seemed to be one of the best options. That's part of the problem -- the game looks absolutely fantastic (believe me, you've never seen castles and canyons pop off the screen so beautifully), but it all plays like a dumbed down console racer. The AI was confusing, with cars weaving erratically around corners like bees shot out of cannons, with no real regard for the actual physics of the track. Controls, though logical, were simplified to the extent that almost any hard corner could be taken with a simple tap of the brake, then gas. That's it. There was no real technique needed to beat any race, which is a necessity nowadays for any racer, grown-up or small. Even though the concept is a blast, the hot pursuit mode ends up feeling a bit limited in the end, especially when the coolness of hearing cops tracking you down those curvy streets begins to lose it's luster.  Need for Speed: High Stakes isn't a bad game. It's the Ford Taurus of software, providing reliable, honest workmanship with a nice interior and some good standard options -- it's just that some people will be looking for a Ferrari, or at least a rocket-strapped VW Bug to bring up the pulse a bit. The outside shell has been honed to perfection by EA, but it feels as if they forgot about adding a fuel-injected engine under the hood. It looks like a racer, but all too often it ends up driving like a sedan.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Jun 30, 1999"}
