It's hard to believe that it's been that long  it seems like only yesterday that he, the high-speed hedgehog Sonic, first dashed onto the gaming scene. It was in this game that he made his debut. Sonic the Hedgehog arrived on store shelves in June of 1991, refocusing the marketing for Sega's 16-bit Genesis console and setting up a legendary rivalry with Nintendo's Mario and the Super NES. Its attitude, its fresh gameplay and, most of all, its incredible sense of speed made Sonic an instant classic. It's since been played by millions of gamers, on the Genesis and on later systems through various re-releases and its inclusion in several retro compilations. Here on the Wii, it's been re-released yet again as a launch title for the Virtual Console download service  and though we've played it plenty of times before, the nearly 16-year-old Sonic still holds up as a great, fun, and fantastically fast gaming experience.   Sonic, the character, was born of necessity. Sega saw that Nintendo was making a killing with the NES and its array of Mario-starring platformers, and decided that if Sega systems were really going to make a dent in the industry they'd have to go head-to-head with the mustached man by having a mascot of their own. The members of Sega's Japanese development teams were given the chance to come up with creative ideas for what that mascot would look like, while concurrently a game engine and style of play were being conceived to showcase the new star.    As development moved toward a game focused purely on speed, the character candidates were narrowed down to a handful of animal designs  animals that could potentially run very fast, and attack without losing their momentum. The team settled on two kinds of creatures that could roll their bodies into a ball  an armadillo, and a hedgehog. The concept was that the ball form could serve as a rolling and jumping attack without slowing the game's sense of speed. The armadillo design wasn't dropped completely, as it later became the basis of Sonic universe character Mighty the Armadillo. But the hedgehog idea won overall, giving rise to Sonic himself.   In this first outing, Sonic finds himself opposing the mechanized forces of Dr. Ivo Robotnik. The mad scientist has taken over South Island, encasing its natural population of animals in cybernetic shells as he seeks to find the legendary Chaos Emeralds. As Sonic, it's up to you to platform your way through the robotic animal army, gather the Emeralds for yourself, and stop Robotnik's scheming once and for all.   Sonic is less a platform-jumping game than a platform-running game, though. Most of the game's stages are built to showcase the character's speed, and are filled with springs, slopes and loop-de-loops to send Sonic sailing at faster and faster velocities. Along the way you'll gather rings. The glowing, circular collectibles serve both to increase your score and also to protect Sonic from imminent death  as long as you're holding at least one ring, a collision with an enemy or environmental hazard won't kill you.   There are also other things to grab  protective shields, temporary invincibility. Even extra-fast running shoes that make Sonic dash at an even more relentless rate. You can take the time to scour each stage, finding and grabbing each of the hidden collectibles, or just run as fast as possible to the end of each act. Sonic has acts, three each per zone, and there are six of those. It's not an overly large number of stages, but the game as a whole is highly replayable  even after 16 years.   And even after 16 years, the game still looks great. You'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through in this Virtual Console edition, especially if you've equipped your Wii with the power of progressive scan. Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic's graphics engine, which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game's known for. But the technical achievement impressed back in '91, and still does so today.  Sonic the Hedgehog is a wonderful classic game to have holding down a spot in your Wii's array of channels. The only thing that should hold you back is your own personal history with the title  you may be one of the millions who've already played this game to death over the years, or you may already own it in another form. This Sonic has made encore appearances in Sonic Mega Collection on the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2 and Xbox, Sega Genesis Collection on the PS2 ... the list goes on and on. So check your last-gen library, check your sense of nostalgia, check to make sure you don't still have your old Genesis hooked up to AV port 3, collecting dust behind your entertainment center, and then feel free to jump back in. It's still fun to run in Sonic's shoes, even after 16 years.", "date": "Jan 27, 2007"}
