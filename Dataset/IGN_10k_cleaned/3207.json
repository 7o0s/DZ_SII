{"name": "Ice Climber", "name_review": "Ice Climber-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/ice-climber-e", "text": "Ice Climber-e is one of the five different classic NES games Nintendo has reissued in its brand-new e-Reader format. To play the game on the Game Boy Advance, players will need the e-Reader device and scan the ten data strips on the game's five e-Reader cards.  The title says exactly what the game is: players assume the role of a parka-donning character who's task is to simply climb up to the top of a mountain peak, shattering ice blocks with his hammer in order to gain access to the different layers of the mountain. Players can also use the hammer to whack the different enemies trying to push the ice climber off the mountain. Bonus rounds are at the top of the mountain, but if you screw up during this round, you get no points at all. This game's all about the points. Ice Climber-e is obviously inspired by Nintendo's other platform hopping games, but it has its own feel and control...and loose as the controls are, the game is a lot of fun. It's a shame that the e-Reader NES games don't support the link port, because the original Ice Climber game featured two players climbing up the same mountain at the same time. This gameplay feature is sorely missed in its e-Reader format.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
