No, really!  Stop laughing, and pick yourself up from the floor.  It's all true, every last word of it.  Sit quietly and Grandpappy Brenesal will tell you exactly what he means, in his typically dazed fashion, while you drink your rum baba.   You see, in those pre-Windows, DOS days, developers didn't have to worry about compatibility with four different chipsets or eight video cards; and when games were still relatively small affairs that could be encompassed on a few floppies, it was easier to tie up all the loose ends before releasing final code.  Programmers could afford to take their own sweet time doing so, because they didn't have to worry about owing their souls to publishers, hiring publicity firms, or paying exorbitant fees to monopolistic distribution chains.  That's not to say all titles were perfect during the horse-and-buggy era of computer games.  They were blatant exceptions like Microprose's Darklands, arguably one of the finest RPGs ever made, but only playable after eight patches.  Still, that's just the point: Darklands was an exception, and everybody was aghast when it occurred.  Many games of the same period and earlier required no patching at all, and others received the courtesy of a general tweaking patch before fading into fond memories and private collections.   Contrast all this with the past year.  I have seen, played, and occasionally reviewed a host of games that were released in a partially disabled state.  Warlords IV didn't have fog of war.  KotoR won't run on my PC, thanks to my Radeon 9600 card.  Deus Ex: Invisible War has also frame rates and some of the worst texturing I've seen outside of Donald Rumsfeld's face.  Lionheart looked like its first city had been completed before the team rushed to throw in hundreds of cloned battles to make up for the missing rest.  Temple of Elemental Evil had so many bugs that a list compiled by some of its irate players and distributed on the Troika forums ran to more than four pages.  Releasing hobbled code to a public for beta-testing never used to be SOP; at least, not if you weren't the latest, greatest Windows release.  Something has changed, and it isn't for the better.     These and similar uncharitable thoughts stalked through my mind this past week as I played the latest strategy game from Paradox Entertainment.  You probably know this development company better as those delightful Swedish folks who gave us the superb Europa Universalis series, Hearts of Iron, and the amazingly underwhelming Valhalla Chronicles.  Fortunately, Victoria used the EU2 engine, so I fully expected it to live up to PE's standards for that game.  You can guess the rest.   Mind, I'm not saying Victoria was a frumpy dud, whatever the game's namesake may have looked and acted like in her old age.  In fact, it is a rich title, combining many of the best features of EU2 with a whole new level of economic and political challenge added to the mix.  But the game balance needs a lot of tweaking, even with a first official patch already out of the way, the manual is all but useless, and the interface is pretty counter-intuitive and unattractive.   Now give me the rest of your drink, and go make another one for yourself.  We've got a long road ahead of us.     The Basics  As you might know if you'd attended school instead of working from the age of five in the wheat fields, the final blaze of British imperialism covered a period lasting from the defeat of Napoleon through the end of WWI.  True, Britain kept several important colonies long after that, such as India, Nigeria, and Wales.  But effectively, the British Empire began unraveling shortly after the birth in the last century of the late, great comic, Spike Milligan.  There's probably a lesson in that.   Victoria concerns itself specifically with that time frame of nearly ninety years, between 1836 and 1920.  While each of the four successive campaigns ostensibly lets you strut your stuff as one of many Great Powers on the world stage, you can right-click any of them and select from a lengthy list of other nations, instead.  In this fashion you can take the helm of Beroda, Annam, Kutch, or the Ionian Islands.  Admittedly this kind of all-inclusiveness is a bit silly, since you can't achieve anything save a waste of time as the leader of the Ionians.  (Actually, you could, but only if you predated Homer, and your name happened to be Odysseus.)  Opting for a secondary power, though, has its attractions.  It's certainly possible with a little personal help to move the likes of Argentina or Japan closer to the center of the 19th century world stage.   The game world functions in real time.  Pausing is not only an option: it's a necessity.  There's simply too much data to track in this strategy title, and AI-driven opponents are relatively competent at assessing their resources, deriving objectives, and following through to completion.  Victoria is played on a 2D world map, with four zooming levels.  If you feel the need to jump to an unseen portion of the globe, you can always use the handy mini-map.  The graphics are adequate but often ugly.  Paradox would seem to hold the opinion of one celebrated game designer I've known for years, who believes that people wanting attractive visuals in any game are best fit to serve the ecosystem as digestible biomass.   Victoria supplies five basic means by which any budding leader can interact with its world: economics, national politics, international diplomacy, technology and the military.  Let's take a look at each.   Economics  This is one of the two major areas where Victoria has significantly increased the depth of EU2 gameplay.  Where individual provinces of a nation each produced a single resource for export in that earlier title, Victoria allows you to combine a mix of locally harvested resources such as grain, lumber, or coal, with others you can purchase from an entity known as the World Market.  (Note that nations with a higher prestige factor gain earlier access to the World Market.  This makes a good deal of sense.)  You can transform your farmers and laborers into ~craftsmen,~ a very handsome euphemism for the social dregs of the Industrial Age who worked city factories back then and had a life expectancy in the high twenties.  No factories?  No problem: you just need money in your national treasury, and the appropriate resources to start up one of fourteen types of factories.  A luxury furniture factory, for example, requires regular furniture and hardwood, while an ammunitions factory requires iron, sulfur and coal.    Wait one year, and your new factory will be in operation.  Of course, you'll still need to supply it with a regular stream of those resources.  So it's back to the World Market screen, where you can either sell or buy, and put in a given number.  I can't say I like the slider mechanism employed: it's a very small, thin bar, which means you can either make a huge change by double-clicking and moving it, or single unit incremental changes by repeatedly clicking on either end.  (Apparently, no one told Paradox about a wonderful new development known as the keyboard parser, which allows you to enter a two digit number with two keystrokes.)  Still, it does its task, automatically buying what your factories, people and military require per your instructions, and selling above whatever numerical threshold you set.     Be aware that although you pay out of national coffers for factories, you don't get any direct benefits from the results of local sales of consumer goods.  Rather, your people make money (how much, and how it's divided, you're never told) when you sell the output of factories on the World Market.  The tax rates you set for your three economic classes, who seek out and consume different resources, determines how much money you have at your disposal.  But tax rates shouldn't shift on their own, and they do so rather startlingly in Victoria.  I've seen rates of 24% slide as low as 14% and as high as 39% without human interference.  (And no, you don't set it as a fixed amount of revenue, but as a percentage of income.)     I've mentioned three economic classes, but there are also ten population types that represent your civil and military forces to consider.  Clerks are taxed in the middle income group, and generally liberal; they appear to work more efficiently than lower income craftsmen.  Clergymen lower the level of political agitation in your culture.  (These are surmises on my part, based on extensive play.  Bad documentation doesn't indicate any reason for either of these population types to exist.)  You can convert farmers or laborers to soldiers and craftsmen, but these efforts require a lot of money for training and resource-based supplies.  On the other hand, converting a craftsman into a farmer requires nothing at all, not even a bag of seed.  They must be part of that wonderful class of air farmers we've heard so much about, lately.     Finally, you set your budget, determining the funds spent for education, crime fighting, defense spending, army/navy maintenance, and social spending.  These figures can be constrained by national politics, so let's deal with that, next.   National Politics  If economics has moved out of the background to become a major game system in Victoria, national politics has appeared out of nowhere.  It is arguably the strongest, and weakest, part of the title, but in any case, it's definitely the most frustrating.   First, your country is divided according to profession, political affiliations, religion, nationality, as well as primary and secondary issues on the mind of each citizen: free trade, pluralism, or a pro-military stance, for instance.  With all this in mind, it's surprising how simple it is to change the mind of many of your people.  All you need to do alter their profession.  That's right: if you convert a farmer (as representative of thousands or tens of thousands of citizens) into a craftsman, he ceases to be conservative and becomes liberal.  Or, if you cut back on the ready supply of those goods he especially prefers, he'll turn socialist (and presumably plaster pictures of Eugene V. Debs up all over his bedroom walls).  As an option that entails a major shift in your populace's views, this class conversion system seem curiously simplistic for everything else it affects.   You can also influence the trend of national politics by spending large sums of money to change the status quo in several generic categories: political reforms, political parties (permitting their formation), voting rights, trade unions, public meetings, and press rights.  Refusing to allow public meetings will please the more entrenched upper class, while permitting them thrills more liberal elements in your society.  Or so the theory goes.  There's virtually no feedback mechanism to let you know how your changes are be taken at large, save for the game's various pie charts, and they often provide contradictory results.  I opened up multi-party politics, universal suffrage, trade unions, etc, in Sweden, but the political menu continued to show only Liberals and Conservatives running throughout history in regularly scheduled elections, each with their own policy platforms.  Yet a breakdown of my country's political culture actually put the Socialists second behind the Conservatives at roughly 26%, with the Liberals staggering around badly at 16%.  The Conservatives had 58%.  The Socialists had no party in Sweden, however, which is ridiculous, and the voting public had chosen the Liberals through five successive elections.  Something is seriously wrong in all this.   There are a variety of equally expensive social reforms you can enact, affecting maximum work hours, minimum wages, safety regulations, health care, unemployment subsidies, and pension funds.  This set of reforms affect productivity, class happiness, and population growth.  Or at least, that is what's supposed to happen.  In actual fact, I ran Denmark as a welfare haven in the 19th century, and my productivity never appeared to change.  Nor did my population increase by a single person in more than sixty years; all, this, despite the revolts in the German and Italian states, or the uproar in Russia.  Then I tried the United States, and turned it into a fascistic dictatorship, turning off all of the political reforms and instituting none of the social ones.  It took a lot of effort (and very low taxes) to keep my brutalized people quiescent, but it worked; and guess what?  At the end of seventy years, vast numbers of immigrants were flocking from Europe to live and die in my gutters.    All of this made me suspicious, so I checked with Paradox. Sure enough, national population growth is tied in Victoria directly into historical growth, rather than, say, to the social reforms you enact, as stated.  Which is frustrating, because the game is supposed to be about your actions as a national leader and their consequences.  If some of those important actions have no consequences, and the game chooses instead to mirror history as it would have been if you'd never stepped in, why bother playing?  In addition, this is out of sync with the rest of the way Victoria operates.  There are special events that will be triggered under certain circumstances, allowing you to cause drastic alterations in political history.  It seems quixotic to disallow changes in historical population/immigration/emigration rates, with such far-ranging changes as a United Scandinavia or a seceding northeastern corridor in the US already in the mix.   International Diplomacy  This is one area in which the EU series has excelled, and it fits well into Victoria.  You can declare war/sue for peace, or declare a colonial war, which means you and the other Powers will fight it out strictly in the confines of some pitiful ~lesser~ nation's borders.  You can ask for naval or army access, guarantee another nation's independence, and send an expeditionary force to a nation which the grateful recipient then controls as its own.  The manual mentions the option to influence another nation's attitude to more closely resemble your own, but that doesn't appear to be in the game; in turn, there's an option to improve relations with another nation, that isn't in the manual.  You can also negotiate for the exchange of any combination of territory, technology, province claims and cash.  Selling technologies to an up-and-coming third party who doesn't directly challenge your strategic policies is a good way to make a lot of money quickly, though you're limited by the number of activities you can undertake in any given year.  Prestige, your status as a Great Power (or not) and a base factor of one control how many diplomatic actions you're allowed.   This last bothers me.  Prestige is a measure of how your nation is viewed by others, so the more prestige you possess (through winning wars, claiming colonies, investing in defense spending, etc), the more diplomatic actions you can initiate in any given year.  I can appreciate this as a gaming element in theory, but is it reasonable to allocate only two diplomatic action points per year to Great Powers like Britain, and only one point to everything ranging in industrial and military might from Sweden to Sikkim?  The last two certainly aren't weighted equally in any other fashion in the game.     I have concerns about how AI-driven nations resolve conflicts, as well.  Choices of whom to attack, and when, what to build and what allies to secure ahead of time show good sense in general, but the AI does some very strange things when it comes to sitting down at the bargaining table.  I've had allies who contributed nothing to a lengthy war receive offers of more provinces from a defeated party than any of those nations who actually took a large part in achieving victory.  Then, too, I've received offers of provinces that were as many as three times the number I requested, but scattered all over the map in a fashion that made no geographical, geopolitical, or intellectual sense.  As Austria, why would I need five provinces in the Far East like Yakutsk and Verkhekolymsk, when I'd settle for Rovno alone, adjoining my nation?  Do the Russians really want hundreds of thousands of Austrian troops and administrators crossing their territory to set up a second front on their eastern border?  Yet they'd never agree to Rovno instead, even though I'd already overrun it.   Finally, the diplomatic game balance that was also such a prominent and pleasing feature in EU2 is seriously out of whack.  EU2 players will know what I mean when I say the magical phrase, ~bad boy.~  In EU2, anybody who started upsetting the general balance of international affairs was likely to bring down the wrath of all upon himself.  But in Victoria as it's currently configured, you have to go far beyond even 19th century boundaries of international greed to get the other major powers gunning for you. By which time you can easily afford to throw each a far-flung province or two, just to get them off your back.   Technology  I strongly like the variety and depth of the technological research tree.  It's divided into five basic areas (Army, Navy, Commerce, Culture, Industry), each of which has five sub-areas containing five applications a piece: one-hundred-and-twenty-five possible breakthroughs in all.  You can select one out of five possible technologies to study at any given time, depending upon which of six ~Intellectual Establishments~ your nation owns.  If you're gifted with an Army-Industrial Complex, you'll be able to choose among three army, one industry, and one randomly selected technology at any given time, while a Traditional Academic Circle provides one possible technology for your consideration from each of the five basic areas.  As national leader, you can switch intellectual establishments, but doing so incurs a prestige penalty.   Much as I liked what Victoria had to offer here, it still seems somewhat buggy and less than completely informative.  At one point I was allowed to study an industrial advance, for instance, that allowed Cheap Steel.  But a quick check in the game's technological library showed that I still hadn't researched the earlier Cheap Iron, much less Cheap Steel.  This is made more confusing because there's no way to click on a potential technology and follow along through a series of future technologies to which it might distantly lead, or bring up a particular application and find out just how far along you are in researching everything necessary to bring it into existence.    Military  There's not much to report, here.  The EU series has never focused on military combat, which involves little more than two forces pounding on one another with only unit variables such as fire and shock attack, morale and organization, to affect performance.  A unit consists of one or more divisions in Victoria, and a leader: either a generic, shadow-faced one, or a named leader who brings bonuses and potential penalties to his troops.  (I haven't seen these latter change during gameplay, as they do in Medieval: Total War.)  You have to deal with supplies and attrition, but there's very little actual war strategy involved in combat.  Even the topography, that looks so attractive from the main screen, only affects troop movement, without providing bonuses or attacks based on terrain.   Interface  If I'm presenting the interface as though it were a separate, major feature in Victoria, that's because it is.  A strategy game as deep as this (or Imperialism II, Patrician III, etc.) often relies heavily upon menu systems, and Victoria's no exception.  But whereas EU2's interface is fairly straightforward and logical, that of Victoria is more than a bit of a scramble.  I say this, not as someone who approaches Victoria with any inherent bias against strategic complexity, but as someone who relishes that sort of depth.     You can access shortcuts to your national budget, the World Market, the technology screen, etc, by clicking on the Crown (country management view).  But clicking Production on the same menu doesn't bring up a list of your factories.  In fact, there is no overall national factories list; you have to access them by clicking on a ~state,~ which is collection of provinces.  (It's not a political entity, but an arbitrary grouping created to make accessing such features as factories and converting professional classes easier.)  This is awkward, and all-too-typical of an interface that doesn't give you enough shortcuts to get easily from one place to another.     Matters aren't helped by the way Victoria relies upon words rather than icons or words-and-icons to define its menus.  You have to read text to identify where you want to go in this menu system; and while I'm a strong believer in the printed word (Hell, I invented movable type.  I lost the patent to Johannes Gutenberg in a card game, which by all that's holy I should have won, since I rigged it), a smartly chosen image will sink into the imagination quicker and more effectively than any label.  Or do you honestly believe that the phrase ~leggy redhead~ adequately substitutes for a picture of Nicole Kidman?  On the one place Victoria does use icons extensively, in the list of nearly two dozen resources for trade on the World Market menu, they're extremely small and poorly drawn.  Since that menu already takes up half the length of the page and doesn't stay exposed once you leave it, the developers might as well have made it twice as long, somewhat wider, and employed bolder, better differentiated icons.   It only makes matters worse that Victoria uses a tiny font with black lettering on a tan background.  I've passed my half century mark with my 20/20 vision intact, but after any Victoria gaming session lasting more than two hours my eyeballs were crying for the company of a nice glass of ice water.     General... Well, Bugginess  Not game glitches that stop the works, you understand.  I haven't experienced anything like that in Victoria, not in Win98 nor WinXP.  I'm referring to bugs that interfere with gameplay.  I've already detailed several important ones, above, but there are many more.  Turning back to my previous example of Sweden, at one point an event occurred that allowed me to optionally guarantee Denmark's independence, gain approximately thirty-five prestige points, and enter into a war with Austria.  I agreed, and two months later, settled a separate peace with Austria that left Denmark once again on its own.  Despite my guarantee, still in effect, I suffered no prestige or diplomatic relationship penalties.   More troubling still is the equation that leads to population growth.  Yes, I know I previously discussed a lack of population increase in many nations throughout Victoria's period, but the reverse side of this is the inordinate growth of some other countries.  Consider Russia: sure, it's a large, generally cold place, and people have to do something to keep occupied indoors during those long winters on the frozen steppes.  But the idea of Russia having more than one billion people by the turn-of-the-century is frankly astounding.  Even if some modern Swedish fertilization clinics relocated there.I fully expect Paradox Entertainment to address many of these issues of population growth, AI treaties, prestige, etc, over the next couple of months.  They did it with EU2; they'll do it with Victoria.  Unlike some developers, I don't expect them to leave us players high and dry as they move on to their next major title.If I were to assign an overall rating to a fully functional, well-patched, excellent-manual-enclosed Victoria, it might be an 8.5.  But I can hardly give a rating to that final product when we weren't sent it for review.  Like every critic at IGN, I've been caught out before by magnificent gaming concepts that failed to fully translate theory into practice.  So while my ratings here are relatively low, they reflect the current state-of-game as I see it.  Not good, no; but hardly irreparable.  There's an excellent game struggling to surface in Victoria, and I look forward to playing it just as soon as the requisite patches appear.  Now would some kindly soul please create an accurate, intelligent manual for the game?", "date": "Dec 9, 2003"}
