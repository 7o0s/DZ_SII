That's the sound of Konami releasing yet another Disney branded sports game unto unsuspecting GameCube owners. These titles, save for the company's Disney Sports Soccer, which actually shined, have practically come to define the meaning of the term ~cash-in,~ and the latest entry is no different. Disney Sports Basketball arrives with the license in tact, but take away Goofy and Mickey and you're left with an overly simplistic, shallow, boring, run-of-the-mill three-on-three court game that bricks pretty hard. FeaturesThree-on-three basketball Features a full cast of Disney characters and teams Five standard gameplay modes Simplistic control and finite options Multiplayer mode for up to four players Requires 15 blocks on Memory Card Doesn't run in progressive scan mode or support DPLII Gameplay It feels like we've written this review five times before. Disney Sports Basketball is clearly targeted at a younger demographic -- you know, that one so young it still appreciates Mickey but isn't opposed to a little basketball either. We've never met anyone like this, but surely they exist. The title thus delivers a basketball play experience that is just about as simple, repetitive and boring as possible. Classic Disney characters square off in three-on-three court ~action,~ with a very finite selection of possible moves and options. Back and forth we go, pressing the A button to execute the same lay-up or shot over and over, and X and Y to pass to our other teammates. This routine takes up the majority of the sleep-inducing experience, but it is occasionally separated by special moves that can be activated when a 'fever' meter is full. The satisfaction gained when a dunk is slammed in is lacking and probably pointless because the target audience here -- very young -- is likely to remain ignorant of the option. Meanwhile, older gamers will run screaming.  That's not to suggest that the game is awful. It's not. It's merely sub par. Basketball can be played and even enjoyed on some level, however, for most the sluggish pace of the back-and-forth mixed with the laughably poor opposition AI -- on average we outscore our opponents by 50 points and steal and block the ball some 25 times -- will be big turn-offs that the Disney license can't mask.      Speaking of the license, it is at least used well. You'll find Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Huey, Goofy and Max all selectable in the game and each is fit with their own style of play. While Goofy is tall and able to easily lay-up, Huey is tiny, but much faster on the court. It's fairly well done and for that Konami definitely deserves some credit. Also a bright spot is the four-player simultaneous mode, which could very well keep youngsters busy for a good stint but is of little use those of us old enough to wipe our own backend.  Take away the license, though, and all that's left is an impressively run-of-the-mill basketball effort with very little in the vein of depth or originality. Please Konami, no more. We're not sure we can take it. Graphics Disney Sports Basketball does score two points for graphics. The game's visuals are bright and colorful, the character models detailed and well animated, the textures crisp and the framerate smooth. Everything from the slick menus to the courtside particles is fairly impressive. However, the camera could use some work. It often shoots the action from a disagreeable angle and, even after modification, never seems quite right. Kids will surely find it bothersome.  Sound The audio portion might appeal to the younger crowd with its over-the-top play-by-play and standard selection of music, but we can't fathom how or why. The announcer in the title makes us want to stab ourselves but his nightmarish voice does at least pound into our heads crisp and clear, which counts for something. Most of the sound effects are subdued, which is disappointing.Disney Sports Basketball arrives with the full cast of recognizable icons including Mickey, Goofy and Donald and the presentation -- from menus to courtside visuals -- is well done. But the play mechanics, while passable, are uninspired, repetitive and downright boring. Kids aren't likely to appreciate the collaboration between mouse and ball, nor is it probable that they'll understand the mechanics of the special moves. The rest of us just won't care because it's all so shallow and slow-paced.Don't bother.", "date": "Apr 23, 2003"}
