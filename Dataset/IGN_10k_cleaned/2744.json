The twin Hitachi CPU's, unencumbered by graphics limitations, can handle complex environments more readily than the R3000A. Andretti Racing is a title that makes good use of the Saturn CPUs, combining realism without sacrificing speed.The first thing you notice about Andretti is its sense of speed. Like Daytona USA or Rally, this game has a high frame rate. Control is excellent as well, responding instantly to your touch on the D-pad. Driving feels natural, with the exception of crashes, which will lock you into a vector a little too long. The only detraction from gameplay is the lack of analog control, which Rally and Daytona have.Graphically, the game looks identical to the PlayStation, with the exception of a slightly lower resolution, and increased draw-in in two-player mode. In general, though, the cars look more solid, more on the track.As a simulation, Andretti sports the EA penchant for configurability. Choose spoiler heights, tire materials, even gear ratios can be changed in minute increments to suit your driving style. Keeping all of these variables in mind is easily handled by the Saturn.For racing fans, this game is a must. Check it out.", "date": "Jan 2, 1998"}
