Taken together, they will clearly go down in gaming history as possessing the two silliest titles of all time. But wait: there's more! Divine Divinity was also one of the most enterprising RPGs to appear in quite a while. It didn't offer a complex combat system or extraordinary graphics, but supplied solid, largely nonlinear gameplay, a host of quests and a huge, interactive, event-filled environment. As you might expect, these qualities have carried over into Beyond Divinity. Companies with a hit on their hands are usually smart enough to quickly turnaround their current engine in a successor game that pragmatically offers more of the same. What probably won't be expected by fans of Divine Divinity is the degree to which Larian has deliberately tried to improve upon the original.   This is important to remember, because in the comments that follow, I have quite a bit to say about the flaws in Beyond Divinity. However, nothing written here is meant to detract from the developer's obviously genuine desire to go much further in their new game than in its predecessor. Some game series in all genres have become the victims of instant recycling. (~Brand new! Everything you liked before, only more of it! And you get to play it again, JUST FOR PAYING THE SAME PRICE ONE MORE TIIIIME!!!!!!!~) Larian hasn't done that, and it speaks well to both their love of the RPG genre, and their vision of what they want to achieve.   Divine Divinity? What's That?  Assuming you haven't already played Divine Divinity (which I strongly recommended with an 8.5 rating), think: Ultima VII. Not familiar with that 1994 RPG title? The more fool, you, he noted with a friendly wink of his hayfever-reddened eye. As I observed in a review at the time, its most distinctive feature was the environment's interactivity. Sure, you had plenty of combat, lots of quests, interesting personalities and areas to visit. But whoever heard in a gaming world of being able to play notes on a harpsichord; apply a pail to a cow, and get milk; or lift a rake, and use it as a weapon? It was this kind of detail that struck me most forcibly about U7: The Black Gate, and which even topnotch RPG titles that have appeared since, lacked. With the exception of Anito (a truly fine RPG, as yet undistributed in the US, and developed in the Philippines), the only game that has come close to offering this sense of direct involvement is Divine Divinity. The 2D countryside not only contained food and many kinds of mushroom for various self effects, but it was filled with all sorts of unique incidents, such as a cave with a lich, a wishing well with a testy spirit, and a magical house filled with treasure intended to teach passersby a lesson. While games like KotoR and Neverwinter Nights focused exclusively on areas featuring elaborate quests, Divine Divinity diffused its attention across a much larger map. If individual quests were less elaborate designed than those of, say, Baldur's Gate II, compensation was provided through the exhilarating sense of a wide open, seemingly non-linear land that offered not only a hell of a lot to explore, but a hell of a lot of reasons to explore.   There were other aspects of Divine Divinity that I liked as well, because they eased gameplay. These included the automated quest log, the user-notated map, the log of all conversations, and the trophies window that lists all killed enemies, along with their strengths and weaknesses. Beyond this, Divine Divinity allowed you to configure your character any way you wanted, adding and improving skills and attributes as you killed enemies and completed quests. Notable, too, was Larian's random treasure generator, whose range (for better or worse) meant that you could open a chest to find a sword that was nothing special, or a sword that provided extensive fire and poison damage, while offering a boost to your constitution and storage space for three charms.   Charms themselves were an unashamed import from Diablo. Some items you found or purchased allowed you to add up to five charms of varying quality to an item, boosting your resistances and attributes, or increasing the attack values of your weapons. This gaming sub-system wasn't the only one to come from Diablo; the opening dungeon owed much to that action title, right down to the occasional mob boss who served no purpose other than blatantly offering a much increased challenge and improved goodie reward. Fortunately, Larian escaped the trap of redoing Diablo right after you left that dungeon. The rest of the game was far more interesting because its challenges and quests were more diverse, and less expected.    On to Beyond Divinity: The Positives  All of the above can be found in Beyond Divinity as well, and a lot more. Most obviously, in Divine Divinity, you had one character in your party throughout the game. In Beyond Divinity, you start with two. (Duh.) You play a paladin of either sex who has been captured and taken to a demonic dimension. (Say that thirty times, very quickly.) While there, the local Evil&153; ruler, one Samuel, decides to place a truly fiendish punishment on one of his Death Knights, who has not lived up to expected standards. You're soul-forged together: you can't move far apart, and if one dies, so does the other. Having had his fun, Samuel now ignores his toys, and it's up to the two of you to escape his dungeons. There are, of course, worse things in life than being soul-bonded to a Death Knight. It could have been Leisure Suit Larry, instead; or Z Budapest; or Leisure Suit Larry and Z Budapest, at the same time. But the Death Knight and you don't see eye-to-eye on most things in life, so a fond and unfriendly farewell is probably the best you can hope to achieve. Bottom line: you'll need to find help from someone powerful enough to undo the soul-forge spell.     Still, the Death Knight comes across as a distinctive personality in the game. He's rude, overbearing and scornful, but also informative and sardonic. He adds a unique perspective whose value and depth grows throughout the time you spend together. (He brings more than that to Beyond Divinity. When you're only controlling one character, some decisions can be taken in realtime, on-the-fly; especially since Larian allows players to configure a host of key combinations for spells, weapons, potions, etc. But when you have two or more figures in your party, it becomes necessary to stop time via the spacebar then select respective actions, and let matters proceed. Otherwise, you'll never pass the range of puzzles, traps and monsters that require two party members for their defeat.)   One positive point to note immediately is that Beyond Divinity escapes the ~divine one~ syndrome that afflicts so many RPGs and assembly-line fantasy books: the notion that you're the Avatar, the Bhaalspawn, the descendant of King Arthur or the Galactic Emperor: that special guy/gal who may be a pig farmer, but is really cut out by destiny and hidden parentage for Greater Things. Wish fulfillment dreams may be fun and stress-relieving when carefully accessed in reallife, but as plots they creak like presidential cliches from overuse. In Beyond Divinity, you're special, but you're not that special.   And while we're at it, let's make one minor negative point, here, about your personalized paladin. The profession in RPG terms encloses an identity and purpose, with a roughly defined series of abilities. Even if we allow some flexibility, it seems contradictory at the game's start for you to decide whether your paladin character is going to be a warrior, survivor (thief) or mage, each with a related skill. (The warrior, for example, can do a twirl move that hits all nearby enemies, at the cost of substantial stamina.) By contrast, you don't have any skills associated specifically with a paladin. More confusingly still, you have no expertise with any weapon when the game starts. How did you get to be a paladin in service to a distinguished leader, if the best you could do was strike a pose?   The next improvement of note is the game's sense of variety and continuing interest. Divine Divinity essentially occurred in two acts; and while the first offered great scope in its quests and areas, you never really left the single, major environment, even when you spent brief periods in a forest, dungeon or castle. Beyond Divinity occurs in five huge acts, where your surroundings, overall goals, and available resources are distinctive to each. It adds a feeling of renewal to the title, as well as increasing its challenge.   There are also new gaming sub-systems. Divine Divinity offered charms (as noted above), a pair of teleportal pyramids to move you between two areas, and alchemy: potions you could make to improve health, stamina, etc, after learning a skill and finding some suitable mushrooms. Beyond Divinity includes these, and adds summoning dolls. Like similar objects found in Baldur's Gate II and Planescape: Torment, invocation of the doll expands it into a temporarily living creature that will do your bidding. (When the summoning's power ceases, the doll returns to your inventory.) Another is the crystal pouch, a little inventory device that can hold a group of resistance-enhancing crystals you find. Admittedly, the latter sub-system is nothing much, but the former provides an important strategic element to the game through the introduction of skills to enhance various aspects of your dolls. You could put a skill point into upgrading the level of all summoned dolls, for instance, or into shortening the length of time that must pass before a doll can be summoned again.   Another new game sub-system in Beyond Divinity is the Battlefield: a centralized group of merchants, repetitive dungeons filled with conversation-less creatures who never get out, and lots of booty. Yes, this time we're really back in Diablo. Except that, unlike Diablo, the Battlefield exists in a separate dimension that can be visited anytime, once you find the appropriate key in the game's real world. You always return to the Battlefield at your last location, which makes it an ideal place to leave heavy items that cause encumbrance. (You just have to remember to recover everything before moving onto the next act. A new Battlefield is generated in each act, and everything left in the old one is killed when it resets.) Each Battlefield comes equipped with several dungeons, that rare in turn unlocked by a series of keys you'll discover while wandering through the game.      Other improvements? The most important I can think of is enemy AI in battle. No, enemies aren't smarter, but there's a greater variety of basic types, with more options and a number of sneaky and interesting attacks. Several mage-style units will run from melee, and attack you at a distance with spells; while others cast spells first, cursing you with various handicaps before they close to employ the local equivalent of meat tenderizers. Dialog is better, too. There was a good deal of it in Divine Divinity, but it tended to occur in patches, such as during meetings with the talkative wizard, Zandalor. Most figures you meet in Beyond Divinity, even minor merchants and opponents, have their own distinguishing, brief remarks and attitude. It adds genuine flavor to a title that was already rich in it.   Although Beyond Divinity's game engine is several years old, I have no real complaints about it; or praise, either. It does what it's meant to, and does it effectively. If I want eye candy, I can always play KotoR, where the breathtaking images were partially comprised by braindead enemy AI and extremely linear gameplay. As long as the visuals are suitable for the task at hand, I'm content. There's only one real difference between Beyond Divinity's graphics and those of its predecessor: the 3D rendering of animated figures, that allows you to zoom in on characters. I admit this doesn't do much for me, since those images appear heavily pixilated when viewed closely. On the other hand, zooming in means that when you're surrounded by items (either pre-placed in the game environment, or dropped by your character to lower excess weight) and hit the ALT key for their display, you're no longer forced to scream from the jumbled mess that assaults your eyes. Magnified viewing is better when selecting whom your party members should be attacking when in a group, too, so on balance, the 3D images are probably a good thing. At least Larian's effective artwork hasn't suffered.    The Negatives  But the developers made some other changes in this product besides those discussed above, and in the process arguably shot themselves in at least a few of their collective feet. Let's start with minor issues, and work up from there.   The first point of concern is the manual. It's competent in most areas, but leaves out all mention of alchemy and charms. Divine Divinity players will be happy to note that charms work just as they did in the earlier game, but alchemy has been completely revised; and in any case, it's easy to be mystified on how to use these two essential aspects of Beyond Divinity. Since your party acquires both herbs and charms very early on, at the very least the developers should have included a pair of books (much like those currently scattered about the Act I dungeon) to explain how to use these sub-systems. I'm all for learning-as-you-go, but some things are simply counterintuitive; and basics like how to make vitality potions are essential to survival in Beyond Divinity.   The next problem to note is the interface alterations. Understandably, some changes were mandated by the move from one character in a party to two or more. However, Larian chose solutions that defy standard game conventions. For example, F1 is linked to your PC, and F2 to the Death Knight. So far, so good. But for some reason, they also decided to put your PC's portrait on the right upper edge of the screen, and the Death Knight's, to the left of it. This means that when you click F2, you highlight the character on the left, and when you click F1, you highlight the character on the right. True, you can change the key allocations here, and for a lot more: all praise to Larian for that. But that leaves you with the equally non-standard F1 attached to the Death Knight, who's really only visiting, while your PC is then F2. Since Larian understood the principle of configurable keys, why couldn't they have allowed us to swap portraits around? Or put the pair of portraits on the upper left?   Then there's the matter of inventory screens. In most games, after you open a character's inventory, you can switch to another by clicking the appropriate F-key or portrait. This isn't how it works in Beyond Divinity, though. You can only switch by clicking on arrows in the inventory screen, itself. I've been told by the developers that this was because they wanted to allow players to move items between multiple inventory screens. Since dropping items on your party members' portraits achieves the same result, I'm not quite sure what benefits they thought to confer.   And speaking of inventory, its display remains an unqualified mess. Items haphazardly cover one another partially or entirely. Copying Bioware's solution of gem and potion bags could have helped, but one of Larian's announced improvements for Beyond Divinity was going to be an inventory auto-arrangement button. Unfortunately, it got left out. Don't be confused by the neat-as-a-pin inventory screens that Larian distributed for review use. Some poor employee had to arrange everything to look that neat by hand.   The randomly generated Battlefields feel unfinished. The repetitiveness of the dungeons is brought to the fore by a lack of many graphical design elements. You run into the same desk, or group of three chests, or armor-and-chest station in most rooms and on most walls. The random dungeon generator needs tweaking, as well. I faced down endless level four skeletons in two successive dungeon levels, only to find a pair of level twelve monsters on the final dungeon level: a bit steep as a progressions go. Sometimes, too, the exit from the first level of the dungeon was literally next to the entrance for its second level. Finding your way down (or up, or out or in, as the case may be) is supposed to be a challenge in these dungeon crawls, fraught with peril. When it's a matter of walking your party a few feet, the greatest danger seems to be lack of exercise.    I'm still more critical about the virtues of Beyond Divinity's new skills system, which Larian has been talking up lately. True, the idea of having to locate and pay teachers who ~open up~ skills for you is good, allowing you to add skill points up to a predetermined level. I also think the new skills tree with its logical dependencies makes more sense than the system used in Divine Divinity. On the other hand, many skills lack charisma and memorability: there's little sense of accomplishment when you drop a skill point into improving piercing damage or crushing accuracy. Divine Divinity's skills display screen, too, was a lot more attractive and easier to grasp. Paradoxically, the new skills view, which requires that you click on skill branches to explore them, is a lot less visually interesting and takes longer to find what you need.    In addition, you need to focus a lot of points on a single weapon or spell right from the start of the game, and (unlike Divine Divinity) this leaves almost no points to experiment with other, nonessential skills. Alternatively, you could acquire more skill points by selecting an easier difficulty level of gameplay, but that also turns the monsters you face into little more than papier-mch. Nor does this mesh well with Beyond Divinity's random item generator. You can easily end up dropping many points into one weapons skill, only to find no particularly good weapons of that kind during most of any given game. While it's possible to ~unlearn~ skills, the cost can be prohibitive, particularly later in Beyond Divinity, at precisely the point when you might encounter that fantastic weapon linked to a skill you don't know.     But my strongest criticisms are reserved for Beyond Divinity's game balance, notably, again, in its skills system. Why divide up each kind of arrow (poison, fire, water, normal, explosive, etc) into its own separate weapons skill? Not only is this highly unrealistic, but it's frustrating to the player who prefers archers and is already willing to give up all melee proficiencies. Similarly, you can learn slashing, one-handed weapons early in the game, only to discover quite a while later that there's a completely different skill which improves slashing, one-handed weapons with the use of a shield. Oh, you might think, so that's why my Death Knight hasn't been doing any damage to even the weakest creatures, despite having allocated five expensive skill points in slashing, one-handed accuracy! I don't mind this non-standard weapons division, but would have preferred having a hint that the skill available at start-up was virtually useless when I equipped a shield.   And why include a skill like Embellish, which returns extra gold for making an item look better before selling it? It's a good idea, but the return on a skill point's investment is miniscule, and you don't have ten points to spare for the skill. As much can be said for Wisdom, which barely increases the amount of experience gained, and Lockpicking, which at this point remains broken. Similarly, some spell skills are broken, doing negligible damage even against the most ordinary of opponents. Watching my PC chug mana potion after mana potion just to waste a simple guard with no resistances was frustrating enough. Knowing that I'd spent six skill points on fire magic for that purpose only made the torture more exquisite.   At the other end of the scale is Pickpocketing, whose success rate is laughable. How do you feel about putting a couple of skill points into it, then having the option to steal your choice of nearly a dozen items in one swell foop from any merchant's large and diverse inventory? I left one merchant with two suits of body armor and ten large weapons, two of which had special bonuses. Not only is the ability out of whack for the skill points involved, but on a roleplaying level, it's cause for laughter. Imagine a party stealing so much from under the nose of a trader, who then benevolently wishes them to come back again. Has theft ever been so ridiculously easy? Well, yes; I know about politicians and lobbyists. But other than them, I mean?   Finally, we come to every player's favorite topic: bugs. There were two patches in the German version of Beyond Divinity, before the game ever made it to an English speaking public; and we've gotten two more patches in a relatively short time, since then. I commend the developers for their promptitude in fixing and tweaking their product, but these enormous lists of multiple post-release changes still leave a sour taste in my mouth. A huge raft of major and minor problems have been repaired; but why was the game released in such an obviously beta condition? Larian employed a team of beta busters. How could they have let so many quest breakers, broken items, unbalanced skills, even installation problems remain within a supposedly finished product? In my opinion, using your buying public as your true beta testers is a cynical cost-saving move, however receptive a company subsequently appears to bug reports. Yes, I know Larian is hardly alone in this; Encore's Sacred and Troika's incredibly buggy Temple of Elemental Evil are just as guilty, if not more so. But Larian, which prides itself (justly) on the quality of their product, should be above that.     I gave warning that wed wrack up coverage of an impressive series of flaws while reviewing Beyond Divinity; and so we have. But at the same time, most of them can be fixed or tweaked. Given Larians record in this respect with Divine Divinity, I would expect the game to be pretty airtight in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, the results are certainly highly playable and extremely enjoyable with reservations noted. This is an entertaining and challenging RPG, with less of an emphasis on finger-twitching than thought. Im willing to cut any developer some slack if they try to do more than clone than previous product. Larian has clearly gone a lot farther. If the game balance had matched the creativity and attention to overall design put into this title, I would probably have given it a 90%, because the detail of construction and depth of the environment are truly excellent. But with this many unresolved issues, Beyond Divinity gets an 80%. Thats still a strong endorsement and hopefully a prod in the fundament to companies that think bugs are an insect gamers pay you to spray.", "date": "May 7, 2004"}
