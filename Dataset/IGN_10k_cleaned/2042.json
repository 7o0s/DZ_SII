Anyway, it was self-evident that the PS2 version of the Unreal engine wasn't anything that special, considering it couldn't do more than 30 frames per second with occasionally questionable animation and texture quality.  The game didn't shine too brightly at launch (IGN's horribly wrongheaded review notwithstanding), and most would agree that the system's come a long way in the intervening months.  But it seems that the folks at Human Head Studios had to touch that pot to see just how hot it was, and while bringing the PC action-adventure Rune over to the system can't have been all that strenuous a project, it still looks like they've been burnt.  Rune is nobly intentioned, and as far as gameplay is concerned it hasn't turned out nearly as bad as some other ill-considered PC ports, but by Christmastime there's going to be 3D action games on PS2 that put this to shame.  If you absolutely need some hacking and slashing to tide you over until winter, perhaps this would be worth a look, but it'd be a more prudent move to save your money for that rainy day when Devil May Cry or Soul Reaver 2 comes out.  Graphics  Rune is a very different game from Unreal Tournament, but the quirks of the 3D engine give away their kinship quickly enough.  The framerate is an occasionally inconsistent 30, the character models are looking just a little gimpy here and there, the lighting is fuzzy, and the texture quality has taken a big hit.  Rune was famous for its gorgeous textures on the PC, and that hasn't carried over very well to PlayStation 2.  Now, it looks very much like Unreal Tournament in this department -- lower resolution, less detail, and a generally darker quality.  Why that last bit should happen I have no idea, but the game definitely looks darker on PS2, as if someone just turned up the ~black~ slider.  This is problematic at times, because here and there it makes it hard to tell whether that black space is a tunnel you should enter or a wall that will stop you.  It's a source of much frustration when you're running around trying to find a puzzle trigger, a very common activity in Rune.  Running the game through S-video helps alleviate the problem, but it remains in lessened form.  The quality of the animation varies pretty wildly, I suppose depending on which parts of the game were considered a priority.  Ragnar's own movements during gameplay look just fine, with plenty of different strokes with each weapon and clean running/climbing/swimming animations, and the enemies around him have received a respectable degree of attention.  Smashing environmental objects looks pretty good, too, and lucky for the bloody-minded among us, there's plenty of doors, barrels, and other widgets to break.  The cinematics, however, don't seem to have received much care at all.  Some of them feature such poor animation that you can barely tell what's going on, even when it's supposed to be a key plot point (e.g. the longship destruction early in the game).  There are a few visual high points as Unreal, particularly the animation and texturing of water surfaces (why is it that this looks so pretty?  Go figure.), and the chunky particle effects that fly about as you hack up your monstrous foes, but on balance Rune doesn't compare to the visuals of games developed specifically for the system.  Gameplay  Ya wanna hack?  Ya wanna slash?  Well, have we gotta game for you...  But seriously, folks.  There is actually more to Rune than the mindless spilling of blood, but said activity definitely has a majority stake in this game.  Ragnar's trusty axes, swords, and maces get more than enough of a workout, with only the occasional time out while he switches over to fight with powerful rune magic.  Nonstop slaughter is a more venerable tradition on consoles than it is on PC, so this breed of gameplay is a bit more at home here, but PC reviewers' complaints about the monotony of combat still apply.  There are new enemies to fight, which helps repair one of the original game's faults, but the mechanics of killing them haven't changed an awful lot.  Ragnar's array of attacks still consists of a fairly small repertoire of basic combinations.  One aspect of gameplay that's clearly improved on PS2 is Rune's platforming control.  The PC and PS2 versions alike include a great many jumping challenges, and while they were the source of many complaints on PC, they're not quite as much of a bother with pad controls so long as you can keep your view on the Y-axis stable.  Moving and jumping with your thumbs together just feels more comfortable than having to use a mouse in conjunction with arrow keys to move effectively.  On the other hand, the pad invariably limits the control scheme to a degree.  Once you figure out the dual analog movement and facing controls (or configure them to your taste), getting around isn't much of a problem, but weapon-switching is hampered by the presence of only one swap key -- i.e., you can only move forward through the selection, rather than both ways.  As in UT, too, you'll have to do some tweaking with the analog sensitivity to get it to work for you, since the defaults are a little slow.  Multiplayer wasn't one of Rune's strong points on the PC, and it still isn't on PS2.  Four-player deathmatch might have worked, but one-on-one in a game with only hand-to-hand combat doesn't have the depth to make for lasting fun -- Bushido Blade this certainly isn't.  The framerate hit in the split-screen mode is just an added reason not to spend too much time with it.  Sound  For whatever reason, PC games seem to have a substantial lead over their console counterparts when it comes to voice acting.  Rune, like a great many of its fellows, features a pretty competent suite of actors, considering that the atmosphere and setting naturally call for a little scenery-chewing (what with all this stuff about Ragnarok, the end of the world, defending the Runestones, rending your foes limb from limb, etc.).  The lip synching isn't so great when it exists at all (see earlier complaints about cinematic animation), but that's a small quibble when the acting itself is actually decent.  There's also a suitably momentous score to accompany the limb-rending, lots of ominous Wagnerian bass rumbling down there in the lower register, and the bad guys scream satisfyingly when their souls depart for Niflheim.  Whatever problems this game may have, they're none of them with the soundtrack. But that's kinda low on the overall priority list.  Rune has its good points, but it doesn't have the technology or the design to compete with games made specifically for consoles and specifically for PS2.  It might cut it in the face of weaker competition, but the 3D action genre is going to completely blow up in the fall of 2001.  Once you have a chance to play the demo version of Devil May Cry, you'll have a better idea of what I'm talking about.As such, Rune is probably just worth a pass, or a rental if you've been especially looking forward to a good Viking game (which, admittedly, is something the world has been asking for).  It's too bad it couldn't have turned out better, but the deck was rather stacked against the project from the beginning.", "date": "Jul 27, 2001"}
