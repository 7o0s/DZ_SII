Street quite simply did everything better and with more of an edge. With the arrival of NBA Street 2 on Xbox, GameCube and PS2 you're getting so much more --more dunks, more players, more moves, more music and a lot more street-- that even most fearful anti-sports gamer out there will want to lace 'em up one time and get flashy on the sticks.   EA Canada, the developers behind NBA Street, could've easily gotten away with a few cosmetic upgrades here and there and legions of fans still would've been drooling at the thought of more street gameplay. NBA Street Vol. 2, however, is an irresistible force that offers plenty of innovative in-game moves and controls, a comprehensive single-player campaign and a multiplayer mode that'll turn even the best of friends into vicious enemies temporarily. With so much fun crammed onto one disc, the $50 you'll spend on NBA Street Vol. 2 could be the best money you'll spend on a videogame this year. So far in 2003, it's the MVP of sports games and only a few of its EA football siblings have a chance to take that crown.    More Modes  The structure of Vol. 2 is at least as important as the gameplay itself since every game you play, in any mode, has the potential to make you successful in every other gameplay mode. Street School is the tutorial where rookies and veterans alike will get hip to what's new about Vol. 2 in terms of moves and abilities. Pick Up Game is an exhibition matchup but you'll still be earning reward points that can be spent in the game's rewards shop. NBA Challenge has you taking a team against every squad in the league unlocking legendary players such as George Gervin and Nate Archibald.    Be a Legend is the solo game where you can create your own original basketball player and take him on a tour of hallowed courts developing his individual skills and unlocking new moves, new jerseys of legendary players and a nice collection of surprises along the way. Whether developing your character in Be a Legend to use in a pickup game against your buddies or unlocking Dr. J and Magic Johnson for use in the NBA Challenge, every gameplay mode has direct connections to every other gameplay mode so you're never wasting time while playing Vol. 2.    Since they're all linked together, there's a good 30-40 hours of single player gameplay between NBA Challenge, Be a Legend and Street School. Yes, that much. Be a Legend is by far the most satisfying since it's designed to build up both your and your character's skills step by step so that you'll quickly be putting on your own highlight show in every game you play. In creating your character, everything has a certain cost in development points. Your character's physical dimensions, shoes, outfits, move list and attributes all cost DP's that you'll have to earn in Be a Legend mode itself or they can be purchased for reward points in the game's rewards store. Reward points are earned in NBA Challenge mode but aren't as valuable as DP's -- like the days when 800 Mexican pesos got you one U.S. dollar. This is where the importance of the Street School mode suddenly becomes important because you get a hefty 1000 DP's just for completing the tutorial.   Be a Legend takes you through courts in New York, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and Oakland with different challenges associated with each city. With the exception of New York, each city has a tournament and a street challenge associated with the Street Legend of that town. As the Mecca of street basketball, New York is the first and the last city you'll visit in Be a Legend and it's also where you'll gain access to some of the best unlockables in the game. Street Legends Stretch Monroe, Bonafide, Dime, Osmosis, Whitewater, Biggie Little plus a few of EA's friends from the music industry are unlocked in Be a Legend.    Most of the following NBA Legends and their throwback jerseys will be opened up in NBA Challenge and Be a Legend respectively:   Bill Walton, Elgin Baylor, Julius ~Dr. J~ Erving, Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins, James Worthy, Bob Cousy, Jerry West, Larry Bird, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry, Michael Jordan '96, Michael Jordan '85, Clyde Drexler, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, Connie Hawkins, Earvin Johnson, Isaiah Thomas, David Thompson, Oscar Robertson, Dominique Wilkins, George Gervin, and Peter Maravich.   Most of the Legend listed above also has special moves associated with them. Whether its Maravich's ~The Pistol~ sleight of hand move, Larry Bird's ~The Legend~ quick release jumpshot or Darryl Dawkins' ~Chocolate Thunder~ dunk, you'll be unlocking these moves that can be assigned to your character as well.   NBA Challenge takes you on a tour through the NBA where you have to run through a gauntlet of teams in each division before facing a team of NBA Legends from teams in that division. By the time you run through the Pacific division you'll have to square off against a squad of Ricky Barry, Clyde Drexler and maybe James Worthy and you'll unlock those players for use in other modes. You have to take an already-assembled team of players into both NBA Challenge and Pick Up Game modes, but Vol. 2 enables you to make up your wildest dream teams from any players available in the game. Street Legends, NBA Legends, created players and NBA players are all fair game.    Of all the goods you can unlock in Vol. 2, your own custom nickname is easily the most rewarding. The game keeps track of your playing style throughout Be a Legend and about 60-65% through your career it rewards your created player with a nickname that will be used in the game's play-by-play for the rest of the game, in any mode. This is an idea IGN has kicked around in many stories about how to make better games and EA Canada has executed it flawlessly. Jon Robinson's high flyer earned the nickname Runway, Hilary Goldstein's flashy ball-handler became known as Shakes and my player's uncanny ability to pull out come-from-behind victories earned him the nickname Vengeance. Nobody was bold enough to play poorly or lose a ton of games to find out if there are any ~bad~ nicknames, but then again one should never play Vol. 2 to lose.   By separating the career mode of the previous game into separate parts, Vol. 2 enables gamers to experience different aspects of the same great game without ever feeling like they're wasting time or effort. But of course, the fact that NBA Street Volume 2 is an absolute blast to play is what holds everything together.     Gameplay  Lighting quick action with an emphasis on the flash and flamboyance of street ball is barely held together with in the confines of the basketball rulebook. And that's a description of the original NBA Street. In this sequel, the flash and flamboyance are with a capital F with the ton of new moves we've been given. The NBA realism is just as noticeable too with match-ups and player tendencies adding just enough authenticity for the traditionalists out there.   You can go Off the Heezay and Back 2 Papa in Street 2. These two moves alone will provide enough in-game humiliation to counter any excessive trash talking from your buddies plus they're two of the most powerful trick combo multipliers going. Vol. 2 places an even greater emphasis on linking tricks so when you dribble the ball off of a defender's body (preferably his forehead) and then continue on your run, the payoff is exponentially more than if you'd just dunked on the poor sap. Back 2 Papa tosses the ball off the backboard and back to the ball handler if you're lined up in the key and is a great way to throw the defense off balance since it looks like a shot or a pass.    There's also the lovable little Kick Pass which can be performed anywhere on the court in lieu of a conventional pass. There's no additional risk involved in throwing this move other than a slight delay as your button combos are registered so it become a standard means of linking your trick combos when you need to get the ball to a teammate. Be the Oop allows you to flip the ball to a teammate using the right analog stick while maintaining control of your original ball handler.   If you can shake your defender and take to the air towards the basket, hitting pass will cause your AI controlled teammate to automatically fire the ball back to you for an alley oop. You have the option of abandoning the play and taking control of the teammate with the ball at anytime and the sequence doesn't always have to end with an alley oop. It can just come off like a standard give 'n go. This move can be applied brilliantly when playing head to head games and is proof that EA Canada had all types of gamers in mind when making Vol. 2.    The beauty of Vol. 2 is that all of the moves mentioned above -- Kick Pass, Be the Oop, Off the Heezay, Back 2 Papa -- can be used in combination with the standard trick system off turbo(s) + trick button to create some remarkable plays. You can go off someone's Heezay on an alley oop by skipping a pass off a defender's head to a teammate soaring near the basket. You can use Back 2 Papa to get the ball to bounce a pass off the backboard to a teammate on the other side of the court when you and him are positioned on opposite wings.   Kick Pass to an alley oop? No problem. Since all of your trick combos end with a score of some kind, the game encourages you to pull off as many tricks, with as much risk and variety as you dare. Finishing off with the most impressive dunk or shot you can come up with is the best way to fill up your Gamebreaker meter and rack up those trick points for posterity.    The new Gamebreaker system creates options once you've filled your meter. You can pull of a high percentage Gamebreaker move that's identical to what we saw in the original NBA Street where you add a point or two to your total and subtract one or two from your opponent's score. You can sacrifice your own Gamebreaker in order to erase your opponent's full Gamebreaker meter, leaving you both with nothing and a score that stays unchanged. Or you can pocket your Gamebreaker in hopes that you'll be able to build up another full GB meter and use both of them at once for a Level 2 Gamebreaker.     Since using a Level 1 Gamebreaker carries the same risks and rewards as in the original game, this means you can still be blocked or otherwise thwarted in your attempt to blow the game wide open. The Level 2 Gamebreaker, however.... oh my. It's unblockable and unleashes a yellow tinted mini-cut scene of your players pulling off some Harlem Globetrotters-type antics before scoring on a dunk or outside shot. Inside the 3-point line you're getting 2 points added to your score and subtracting 3 from your enemy's score. Outside the arc, you're taking away an extra point from your opponent. The potential for a six point swing means no lead is safe and makes defense --the toughest aspect of the game-- even more important.    So in addition to all of the special moves and Gamebreakers out there waiting to humiliate you, there's still a scoreboard to worry about in Vol. 2 since it is all about winning. Exploiting match-ups in any game can make a huge difference since the AI is good enough to always have a defender on a each offensive player, but not good enough to keep a big man on a big man if you as a human player do something to disrupt that logic.    Similarly when choosing your three players to take into a game, it makes sense to watch who your opponent uses. Going with three seven footers or three little guys yields the expected advantages and disadvantages but victory is always possible as long as you play to your strengths. A team of Shaquille O'Neal, Dirk Nowitzki and Yao Ming will probably have the rock stolen a lot and won't get you to many steals but you will own the skies with plenty of blocks and rebounds. One truism of NBA Street is that anybody can score once they get the hang of things, but wins and losses will be determined by defense, just like real life. Defense wins championships in the NBA and it negates all razzle-dazzle on the playground as well.  The emphasis is on flashy fun in Vol. 2, but serious hoop fans will be able to pickup and appreciate some of the subtle undertones of fundamental basketball that hold the game together.   Graphics  Fast and intricate animations make Vol. 2 look like the champion that it is. The character models are decent and look progressively better as you move from PS2 to GC to Xbox, but it's the way they move that brings it all together. The real world basketball environments are a delight to anybody that's seen them firsthand, and impressive for casual basketball fans that will appreciate the great textures and lighting.   While the game indulges in a fanciful interpretation of 1970's styles -- lots of stars and stripes, wide curving lines in all aspects of the interface, including cut scenes and even infiltrating the edit-able characters' clothes -- the PS2 version looks different from the other games. It's got harder lines and a slightly gritty look associated with the characters and the backgrounds. It's as if the PS2 version is an upgrade from the first PS2 version, while the Xbox version looks almost entirely different. The Xbox iteration shows off a smoother, rounder look, and it even looks a little washed out, while the PS2 version, again, comes in with harder colors, lines, and textures. It's a technical difference to be sure, one can make the argument that the PS2 version doesn't have the graphical power of the Xbox.   Animation wise, the games are all the same. Since every special move in the game has its own name, it's a great idea that we can recognize them all at a glance. Going Off the Heezay comes with a tasty hip hop sound effect, but being able to see your guy use his dribble animation at angle that sends it off the defenders forehead, and then see that defender's neck snap back is why you'll love it. Doctor J's ~The Doctor~ special dunk looks a lot like Clyde Drexler's ~The Glide~ special dunk, but the position of the legs is what makes the difference. Unlocking Jordan's dunk move gives you stylized version of his '88 Slam Dunk competition winner when he took off from the free throw line before extending that extra hair to put a little funk on the ball as he jammed it through the hoop. Nailing the special dunks was crucial with all of the big names featured in the game and they're the best indication of how detailed the animation is in Street 2.     There are cell-phone toting fans at every court in the game even if they're animations are pretty crude and repetitive. But father in the background of places like Mosswood Park in Oakland or Rucker Park in Harlem you'll find the nice details that make them authentic. You'll even be able to see the players' breath at Chicago's Foster Beach. Bay Area residents will appreciate the Kaiser building rising up in the background and the nonstop bus traffic up and down MacArthur Blvd. The only things missing are the $40 a night motel across the street and the 580 freeway to the west of the court. All of the courts are bathed in excellent lighting and nice detailed textures so that none of them look alike. Not even the two versions of Rucker Park (modern and 1978) are carbon copies of each other.    Sound  EA caught some criticism for the ~Joe the Show~ character in the original NBA Street, so the company made the extremely shrewd move of getting hip hop mini-icon Bobbito Garcia to deliver the same shtick but without the stereotypical undertones. Beyond the enhanced announcing, gamers should get a kick out of the hip hop infused sound effects used to accent steals, blocks and special moves.    Going off your opponent's Heezay wouldn't be nearly as fun without the snazzy sound effect that comes with it. Longtime hiphop fans will be racking their brains trying to figure out where they've heard the quick audio samples that come with most of the moves. The sound designers behind NBA Street 2 harvested some of them from the disco/soul classic ~Heartbeat,~ beyond that you've got us. All of them help keep Street real.    The lineup of licensed music is straight hip-hop with classics like Black Sheep's ~The Choice is Yours,~ ands instrumental version of Pete Rock & CL Smooth's ~T.R.O.Y.~ and ~Chief Rocka~ from Lords of the Underground. New tracks by Nelly, MC Lyte, Just Blaze, Redman and Erick Sermon round out the lineup of contemporary tunes. All the music fits but with the retro theme running throughout the game, part of me wishes there were a few songs from the era of Wilt, Oscar and Julius. Curtis Mayfield or Isaac Hayes would've worked wonderfully. The laidback funk music that kicks in during a Level 2 Gamebreaker is just a taste of what could've been.NBA Street Vol. 2 has quickly become one of my favorite games of 2003. The tons of single player game modes along with the automatic fun of head-to-head matches with your buddies make Street 2 one of the best values on any system. EA usually has top-notch production elements regardless of genre, but the development team in Canada has set a new standard for keeping a consistent theme running through every element of a game. This is one of the main reasons why Street 2 will appeal to casual hoop fans that don't know their triple threat positions from their baselines. Even fans of basketball sims won't be able to resist the flat-out fun with NBA trappings that Street represents.You know a game is strong when online support, instant replay controls and lack of old school tunes are the biggest complaints you can muster. But as a total package, Street 2 is going to be tough to beat. The only thing that could challenge it at this point would be a football version of the same thing. Until that happens rest assured that you're in very good hands with the depth, the moves and the themes of NBA Street Vol. 2.", "date": "Apr 24, 2003"}
