Many are adopting a free-to-play, pay-to-customize business model, which presents an interesting conundrum for us reviewers.  Take FreeStyle Street Basketball, for example -- a bare bones arcade sports game riddled with bugs and tiny annoyances.  But hey, it's free, so what can we complain about, right?   Does the price of admission justify these oversights?  That will be up to you to decide.   First you'll need to create your character.  FreeStyle is free to play, but microtransactions are its bread and butter.  So the options you have to start with are slim pickings.  There are three male body types differing in height and weight, and two female types that are virtually indistinguishable from one another.  You can choose your skin color and the shade of your shirt, but that's about it unless you want to start spending some money.  If you pick up the retail version you'll be given a wad of bills to get you started so you can go ahead and splurge on some sneakers if you like.  Your purchase options are also limited, though, as many items are level-gated and others cost ~points,~ which are earned through gameplay.  The selections can also be slow to load, so you may find yourself with a frozen screen wondering what you did wrong.   As you play FreeStyle you'll be leveling up and earning points.  Many items can only be purchased with these points (or a combination of points and bills) in order to keep players from simply buying a better athlete.  There are also skills, or special moves, that can be assigned to your character.  The folks at the skills shop don't accept your money, so you'll have to part with some points.    Some of the purchasable items will boost your stats -- sometimes in ways that don't make much sense.  A tattoo, for instance, can give you a speed boost (man, if only I had known that when I ran track in high school).  Of course, you have to buy the ability to go shirtless, so you won't be able to see your ink until you've leveled up a bit.  Awesome.   The narrowness of the beginning options can be problematic when you get into a game, as everyone looks virtually identical and it can be hard to tell which dude you're controlling.  A game like this that stresses customization and communal aspects should allow players to individualize themselves right off the bat.  Even with a microtransaction model, a greater variety of options at the start would probably entice players to stick around longer.   Your characters will not look anything like this when you start playing. FreeStyle claims to make it easy to jump into a game and start competing with people from all over the country.  In practice, though, the act of joining a game is a rather frustrating affair.  Sometimes it can't find enough available players.  Sometimes you'll join a team and they'll immediately kick you off for some reason you'll never know.  When you do get two teams together you're taken to a loading screen, and sometimes you'll hang there for several minutes.  If a player loses their connection during a game everyone gets kicked back to the lobby.   When you actually manage to get into a game, FreeStyle is pretty fun.  You don't have to be a big basketball fan or even know much about the sport to enjoy playing.  The game's cel-shaded graphics are bright and colorful and are rendered in a very kid-friendly style.  There are some problems with collision-detection, though, and you'll often find your head buried within your opponent's chest cavity.   FreeStyle is littered with urban ~street~ slang like ~ballers,~ ~drain 3s,~ and ~juiced.~  But it all comes across like it was focus-tested by a marketing team trying to hook a youthful demographic rather than sounding authentic.  The game lobby streams licensed hip-hop tunes by artists like Sha Money XL and Lloyd Banks, and they're all pretty good.  In-game music features a more generic, original soundtrack, though.  Bystanders will comment on the game, and the players will make basic statements like ~I'm open!~ and ~Nice pass.~  But the comments repeat often, and you'll soon tire of hearing the same voices repeat the same lines over and over.   In keeping with its casual theme, FreeStyle's controls are simple to pick up.  Movement is controlled with the arrow keys, and actions are handled with W, A, S, and D.  Each key serves two functions for offense and defense, so you don't have to worry about memorizing complicated commands.  A helpful tutorial is available to walk you through everything, and the controls are displayed before each game in case you need a refresher.   Extensive ranking boards track your stats and let you compare your game to other players.  The leaderboards can be sorted by several different categories like assists and rebounds.A game such as this, with so many bugs and complications getting in the way of gameplay, would be hard to recommendif you had to pay for it.  But the fact that you can play FreeStyle for free right this moment tends to negate a lot of the problems you've just read about.  When I was finally able to get into a game, I really did have a good time with it.  So even though I can't give this title a really high score, you don't have anything to lose by checking out FreeStyle for yourself.  You won't get much customization without spending a little dough, but the core game mechanics are fun on their own.", "date": "Jun 29, 2007"}
