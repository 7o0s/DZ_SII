Developers take a tried and true formula and just slap in the movie's main characters, hoping kids will snap it up. But the guys over at Amaze seem to have the right idea when they made Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. While the game has its faults, it stays true to the subject matter, giving players a true pirate game for their Game Boy Advance.   Players assume the role of everyone's favorite antihero, Captain Jack Sparrow, as he slashes his way out of prison and onto his beloved ship. Players will have to sail the Black Pearl from island to island following the story from the movie, from Jack's perspective. Most of the story is told through cutscenes, each character involved having a still from the movie to represent them. The images look pretty decent on the GBA screen, although having one or two expressions (occasionally one that doesn't match the tone of the conversation) is a bit weird. The dialogue is similar, but not the same as the lines in the movie. This is understandable, since the game is only loosely following the plot, but some of the lines are really bad. It often sounds like a bad fanfiction written by a teenage girl. Jack and Will Turner seem out of character and stiff, which is a step up for Orlando Bloom (zing!).   Dead men tell no tales. Every good pirate lives (and probably dies) by this motto. Jack Sparrow is no exception, and so much of the game revolves around a singular goal: killing everything on the screen. And by everything, we don't mean the same three pirate sprites over and over again. Oh no, the good Captain will face down bloodthirsty pirates, cannibalistic island natives, the British navy, the undead, and even some fiddler crabs. The large assortment of villains to slash down is a nice feature, since we're often bored of the same bad guy, over and over, maybe occasionally painted a different color.   Actually fighting the plethora of land lubbers that cross your path is clumsy and sometimes frustrating. Players will find themselves button mashing as they try to work through levels that are far fetched for a game based on a live action movie. The obligatory floating platforms are all over the place, and navigating between them gets tricky. After the 20th time getting knocked off a platform because we bumped into an enemy and were automatically knocked back a good five feet, we had gotten bored. Luckily, Jack can get upgrades to both his weapon and clothes, as well as learn new combos. This does make the combat less tedious, but never truly carries it to greatness.    The spotty combat doesn't make much of a difference when beating the game, since Pirates of the Caribbean is ridiculously easy. Players have an infinite amount of lives and when they die, Jack just respawns at the beginning of the level. Getting the ship sunk, or having the crew mutiny lands Jack back in an easily escaped prison, and minutes later players will be off sailing again as if nothing ever happened.   As annoying as the enemies, and even Jack Sparrow are to control, they all move with a nice level of fluidity. Despite their lack of detail (they've got no faces!), the characters look great on the screen. Jack sways about the screen with his patented, Oscar nominated swagger, and nearly all of the enemies have a large assortment of animations, save for a few of the pirate-hating wildlife that roam the islands. Even with multiple enemies charging at once, and Jack pulling of some of the more complex combos, we didn't experience any slowdown.   Jack's adventures will take him to various islands, but don't expect to just teleport their automatically Griptonite has made an effort to reproduce the action packed, scurvy-filled lives of pirates at sea by adding a ship sailing element to the game. Players will have to traverse the dangerous waters, paying heed to the wind, as well as the food and grog supplies. Should the crew run out of alcohol and sober up, they'll realize Jack's a terrible captain and mutiny, causing the swaggering swashbuckler to land in prison. The sailing element of the game is interesting, and definitely adds an additional element to the gameplay, but the feature isn't quite seaworthy. The entire section of the game is a lot less friendly on the eyes, and feels more like a minigame for kids on a Disney website. Controlling the ship is awkward, and when the wind isn't blowing in the player's direction (which is often the case) the ship will trudge along at a numbing pace. Add to this the fact that there are tons of other ships in the sea, and all of them want to attack you. If one gets to close, players are forced to have a cannon fight, which then leads to a pillaging of the opponents ship. The pillaging aspect is somewhat fun, and is a great way to earn gold for the numerous upgrades to the ship and Jack. But it still stretches the game out and when players are just trying to get to a tiny island on the other side of the map, it can become frustrating. Trying to sail from one island to the other becomes a chore that takes far too long to complete.   With the entire story being told in a text boxes, there isn't any voice acting to speak of. The developers did include a soundtrack inspired by the Hans Zimmer numbers found in the film though. The music is lively and really captures the feel of both the movie and game. It becomes apparent to anyone passing by exactly what you're playing, and players are bound to be humming the main theme for days (we still can't get the tune out of our heads), and inevitably cursing Zimmer's work for being so freaking catchy.  Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is one of the better license games we've played, and one of the best license games of the summer. Pirates is a lot like that saucy wench in the local tavern. She looks nice, and sounds lovely, but playing with her is an ordeal of getting knocked around and poked with sharp objects (Okay my pirate similes suck). Pirates isn't going to last the average player very long, and unless they have an itching to sail the open sea, or have a Johnny Depp fetish that knows no bounds, they probably wont want to keep playing it for a long time. However, for the younger fans of the film, it's worth a go. It's certainly less painful than the last Pirates game.", "date": "Sep 20, 2006"}
