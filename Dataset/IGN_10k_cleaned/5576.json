From Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie to Chameleon Twist and Bomberman 64, Nintendo's 64-bit console definitely has its share of 3D jump-and-explore titles. In fact, some would say that between Nintendo and Rare, the system has perfected the genre. Why then would Interactive Studios, a newcomer to the hardware, and Hasbro Interactive decide to throw one more into the mix? The simple answer is that their game is different from the rest of the lot, largely due to character design and translated character mechanics.It's called Glover, and it has nothing to do with fat plumbers or backwoods bears and birds. Rather, Interactive Studios' off-the-wall title revolves around a walking, functioning glove named Glover (go figure, eh?), and his various assortment of balls. Sound a bit strange? Yeah well, it is -- but it's also quite a bit of fun.StoryFollowing typical platform tradition, Glover is cute and cuddly in style and theme. One day a powerful wizard is brewing a formula for one thing or another when, low and behold, it backfires. An explosion ensues, turning the wizard into a fountain (yes, a fountain) and sending his two magical gloves soaring into opposite directions. Glover lands safely outside the castle window. His twin glove-brother Cross-Stitch is not so fortunate, landing directly inside the evil stew that Wizard-boy was souping up. As a result, Cross-Stitch is instantly turned evil. Meanwhile, the wizard's crystal balls -- the land's power of sorts -- are thrust out of the castle into the air. Glover, seeing this, turns each crystal into a rubber ball before it can land and shatter. Hey, who says gloves aren't smart? And so the game begins as Glover sets out to retrieve the balls and restore order to the land.As you can see, Glover's story meets platform standards in full. It's overly cute, it makes no real sense unless you're either insane or from the '60s, and it stars an absurd character for players to take control of. If that's not 64-bit 3D platformer in full, we don't know what is.GameplayOK, so platformers and storylines don't mix. Who cares? Gamers aren't exactly supporting this genre for its engrossing tales. Rather, 3D platformers are all about gameplay mechanics and exploration. Luckily, this is where Interactive Studios' game excels. Rather than take the standard jump-and-run approach featured in so many games of this type, Glover employs a unique style directly related to character design. And being a walking hand has many gameplay benefits. Not only can Glover walk and jump, but he can climb, push objects, crawl and smash. Not bad in itself, but when the glove is paired together with a ball, a whole new realm of mechanics open up. For example, Glover can smack balls around into objects and enemies; he can throw balls; he can walk atop balls; he can catch balls and even dribble them. In fact, players must do all of the above and more in order to complete this game.In addition to your standard bouncing balls, Glover -- being a magician of sorts, also possesses the ability to transform his balls. And yes, we're aware of the wording. For example, the regular rubber ball can be turned into a bowling ball, iron ball, or a crystal ball that gives players double-points, but prone to shattering. And that's to say nothing of the game's various assortment of hidden balls. From big to small, hard and soft, the balls are a plenty. Each ball is designed to be used for specific scenarios. For example, the rubber ball is prime for dribbling and bouncing to high platforms and, because it's filled with air, it floats atop water. The bowling ball, on the other hand, can be used to break just about any crate or defeat any enemy.The mechanics can be a little confusing at first, especially mastering Glover's ball movements. But once the control-scheme is mastered, it all works quite nicely and it's easy to recognize the innovation. In fact, the unique glove-ball scheme is the most refreshing gameplay mechanics enhancement for a 3D platformer we've witnessed in some time. Imagine Marble Madness. Now imagine Marble Madness with a glove and balls. You've got some imagination -- and that's exactly what Glover is. The only problem is that, partially because of framerates but mostly because of jerky control, Glover sometimes feels unresponsive. That said, Glover still controls exceptionally well and, had this game only been a technology demo showing off a level or two, it would have been a load of fun just navigating the gloved-one around.The game's levels, a mixture of Super Mario 64-esque 3D worlds filled with cheery colors and simplistically designed enemies, are well-made if not a tad difficult at times. Themes range from prehistoric times to carnival-like and space-age. Each ~world~ features three sub-levels, a boss and a bonus level. The boss battles and bonus levels again feature changed gameplay mechanics, such as navigation of a maze, rolling away from a wall of fire, or shooting balls at targets. In the main game, the object, like any 3D platformer, is to make it through each level solving various puzzles and the like. Glover features the added element of having decide which ball to use at any given time and then executing it correctly. For example, transforming your rubber ball into a bowling ball while on water will cause it to sink, the crystal will gain you extra points, and the iron ball is necessary if you want to transport it from one place to the other via a magnet. In some levels, Interactive Studios also throws snow into the equation. As you roll the ball through the winter landscape, snow will stick to it and slowly increase it in size until it's impossible to roll any further. Apart from being a great effect, it influences gameplay as the snow prevents you from turning the ball into another form. The game is full of such clever details, which is why we recommend it over other third-party platformers like Gex or Chameleon Twist.GraphicsThe description that best fits Glover's look is ~first generation.~ But we don't mean that in a bad way. Super Mario 64 was a first generation game and it looks fabulous -- even by today's standards. That said, Glover lacks the overwhelming texture variety and detail of the Banjo-Kazooies and Star Wars: Rogue Squadrons coming out. It features quite a bit of fogging and framerates drop considerably in certain situations. Low-polygon models lack a great deal of animation and once again, Nintendo's overly filtered blur effect has returned. However, bearing everything in mind, Glover is not an ugly game. It's just very standard.SoundCute and cuddly, but it works. Music fits each level perfectly. High-tension, moody tunes fill the ~Fear~ levels, whereas earlier levels are considerably more cheery and colorful. Sound effects are equally fine-tuned. Bouncing balls hit with a thump, bowling balls roll along with accompanying led sound and enemies manage various howls, laughter, and the like. All in all, not bad.Glover won't blow anybody away in the graphic department. However, because of the game's intuitive gameplay mechanics and off-the-wall character design, I think platform fans will have a lot of fun with this one. Admittedly, Glover does come with a learning curve and later levels can lead to madness, but until you've rolled a ball around a level with a walking hand, well, you're just missing out on the best things in life. Glover has the potential to fall flat on its face or be this year's sleeper hit. Give it a rent. You might just like it.", "date": "Nov 10, 1998"}
