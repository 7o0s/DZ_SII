Once again, you take on the role of a minor despot in 4000 BCE, trying to stand the test of time as a great leader.  This is no small task, though.  Depending on your skill, your people will die off like any number of small barbarian tribes, or flourish into one of the great cultures in history.There are two main game play options available when you start Civilization III.  The Quick Start option uses the same settings as the last game played.  When you play a new game, you are able to select your culture from among a large list.  Each culture has its own strength of game play style and one unique unit.  For instance, if you play as the British you will be expansionist and commercial and you will have the Man-o-War available to you as your unique unit.  If you play as the Romans, you will be industrious and militaristic with the Legionary as your unique unit.  The culture also comes with two starting advances that can vary between cultures.  Playing a new game also allows you to set such variables as the world size, climate, and age.  This provides you with the opportunity to set the stage for whatever kind of performance you wish to put on.  To begin your civilization you have a Settler, a Worker, and a decision whether to try and get ahead by building where you start or continue looking for a location with better resources.  From your first city, you begin developing your future empire.  Build more cities, utilize natural resources, expand your military, increase your knowledge, its all up to you.  The game is overwhelming to explain, but is actually organized in such a way that the player is not swallowed by the depth.  There are a number of ways to win a game of Civilization III, and that is one of the best features.  Using military force to control two thirds of the map or destroying all of your enemies may be the most obvious and familiar way to win, but it isnt always the wisest.  Other options include winning the Space Race and being the first to land on Alpha Centauri, being elected Secretary General of the United Nations, a cultural victory, or a histographic victory.  A cultural victory involves building up your culture to be the envy of the world.  If your culture is attractive enough, it  doesn't matter who the political leaders of the land are, because you are effectively in control.  A histographic victory simply means that none of the other methods were successfully used, so the civilization with the highest overall points wins.  The number of paths to victory is a very refreshing change from most games.  For instance, playing a game as the Greeks I was able to capture many Egyptian cities without any military whatsoever.  I simply built my cities near the Egyptian ones and developed an alluring culture that incited the Egyptians to rebel and join my civilization.  Firaxis should be applauded for accommodating the different styles of game play.The graphics in Civilization III are not overly complicated, but this is not a bad thing.  The terrain is smoothly modeled and the various units are effectively drawn.  My one complaint in this area is that some of the units look similar if you are not familiar with the minor differences in their appearances.  If youve seen the graphics in Caesar III, they are somewhat alike, and thats fine by me.  Sound is a mixed bag in Civilization III.  There are songs that convey the atmosphere of a variety of cultures and time periods, some are hits, some are misses.  In particular, the music of the future is somewhat less than pleasant.  The sound effects are simple and well executed, though some of the environmental sounds could have been cut without anyone missing them.The Civilization series still has a plentiful supply of what one fan called the one more turn quality.  Whatever your complaints about the latest incarnation of the game, it still can suck five hours of your day right out from under you.  That said, I do have some nit picking to do.  The game is a dog in performance.  I tried it on a 700 MHz iBook with a 16MB Radeon card and a new iMac 800 MHz G4.  Even with Quartz turned on, theres no reason the game should run so slowly.  The game also has numerous bugs that cause the application to quit.  While the developers thankfully implemented a feature that autosaves your game every turn, that is no replacement for real stability.  At one point, I had to alter my path in the game significantly to avoid the program quitting.  Lastly, the interface is improved over previous incarnations of the game to the point that it at least looks friendly.  If Sid Meier and friends are hoping to increase the appeal of the game, though, they should work towards making a more intuitive, consistent interface.  Still, for anyone who enjoys strategy games or is looking to try one, I would recommend Civilization III as a worthy addition or starting point for a collection.", "date": "Jun 25, 2002"}
