And while we're definitely quick to agree that it'll never achieve the same widespread popularity that games such as Grand Theft Auto or Halo have enjoyed, it certainly makes us wonder how many hidden fans this franchise really has. Because for a game that isn't supposed to have a lot of mainstream appeal, it's certainly doesn't act the part.   This is particularly true when speaking of Tecmo's latest foray into the creature creation market, Monster Rancher 4. Designed around the idea of improving on every possible facet of the MR universe, this fourth installment adds plenty of new features for the faithful. From the enhanced battle system and refined training regiment to an all-out RPG story mode and altered visual approach, it's a much different game than its predecessor. But more importantly, it's a whole lot of fun.   Breeding  At its most basic level, the actual breeding process in Monster Rancher 4 is still similar to that of previous entries in the series. Using a serial number encoding system, Rancher 4 identifies any CD or DVD signature and changes it into a visual and statistical representation on your television screen. In short, it creates a monster based on the characteristics of the disc inserted into the PlayStation 2 so that you can use it on the battlefield later. This process generates an absolutely huge number of different species and critters that range from plants and werewolves to one-eyed blob things and gigantic fire-breathing dragons.    This process of discovering different types of monsters can take up a huge chunk of your time, and manages to be an addictive mini-game all by itself. In an effort to save our readers plenty of time, though, it should be noted that recordable CDs and DVDs create the same basic monster regardless of what you have copied to them. Of course, that's not to say that legitimate discs won't create duplicates either -- as there are quite a few repeats to be discovered across all sorts of different genres. In an appreciated bit of fan acknowledgement, however, Tecmo has enabled certain discs to supply exclusive animals that can't be found anywhere else; the rolling monster from the PS2 version of Rygar and the Miku look-alike from Fatal Frame are but a few of them.   Luckily there's a whole lot more to breeding than that. As in order to advance the storyline and win battles, you'll need to feed your monsters a variety of different foods to keep them healthy. Each critter has its own palette of likes and dislikes too, so while it may appease your cyclopean Suezo to supply it with bananas, his cyborg stable mate may not appreciate them at all. Speaking of stable mates, Monster Rancher 4 allows players to breed up to five different beasties at once (a first for the series). But to be truthful, when you're deep into the meat of the game, this is probably where your chores can become the most tedious -- as you'll need to keep track and take care of a number of different aspects fueling your creature.   To combat the possible monotony, Tecmo has modified the training schedule and regiment to be user-friendlier. Among the many improvements is the segmented advancement to schooling and the streamlined process for combining two monsters into one after retirement. Perhaps the two most useful additions in this respect, however, is the ability plan your training schedule for up to eight weeks in advance and the added benefit of buying specialized training equipment. Not only does this allow you to work on the aspects of your monster in a manner that lets you attend to other manners, it also allows you to customize the look and efficiency of your farm as well. Best described as an ultra-light version of SimCity, the ranch building feature is yet another advantage that Monster Rancher 4 has over its predecessor.   We just wish that the menus were better organized. Because regardless of whatever action you select from an interface (training, shopping, or whatever), there's no back button or cursor memory that allows you to return to your last action. Also problematic are the information screens themselves: sure they'll tell you what attributes your monster can work on or how much an item costs, but it doesn't tell you what your attributes are or how many units of an item that you already own. To get that information, you'll need to go back to your monster's informational profile and look it up yourself. This aspect should definitely have been fixed before shipping time. Because as it stands now, the current setup ends up providing players with a series of extra steps that they don't need.    Adventuring  Briefly experimented with in Monster Rancher 3, the exploration element has been expanded upon exponentially. Though it's still not as deep or involving as that of a typical RPG or adventure, its importance to the advancement of your character is pretty high. Especially if you want your monsters to learn new abilities, gain special items, or to advance the story further. It's imperative that you do so too, because while Monster Rancher 4 will let you move along at the pace of your choosing, you won't be able to breed more powerful creatures or unlock certain areas until you fulfill specific exploration goals.   To keep players from leveling up and becoming too powerful Tecmo has used a clever limitation. Adding the statistics of the monsters you decide to bring with you, the CPU assigns an overall number that represents how far your party can travel before becoming fatigued and forced back to the ranch. It's an interesting side challenge to the battles you'll encounter inside the cave, as it pushes your knowledge of the dungeon and encourages you to make the proper compromise between ascending up to higher floors to fight stronger monsters and possibly even a boss, or fully searching through the bottom floors for extra items and other goodies; Either way, it's a nice touch.   Another cool little feature is that the monsters you take with you are each given special abilities and powers that let them search in special areas. One group of beasties, for instance, can crawl into caves to hunt for treasure chests, while another cluster of animals can burrow deep into the earth to dig things out. But with as much potential that this little option has, the dungeons themselves are so standard looking with little variety that it's a little less useful than it should be. Though we do have to admit that it's pretty awesome to hop onto the back of your larger monsters and ride them around the cave. Not particularly advantageous mind you, just cool.    Battle  The biggest and most welcome change to the battle system this year would have to be the inclusion of attack plates. Manipulated by the shoulder buttons, each plate represents one of three different kinds of attacks earned through your monster's adventuring career. Customizable through the monster information screen, the three-slot plates can each hold different sorts of techniques to be used together for dissimilar and more varied tactics. Players who suffered through Monster Rancher 3's  process of sacrificing certain assaults for others are sure to appreciate this new feature; especially when your monster is strong enough to support an arsenal of up to nine different moves.   As you could imagine, this nine-attack fighting system provides a much deeper combat experience than what was found in previous Monster Ranchers. And much to our pleasant surprise, has opened up the hit and run strategy into becoming a more useful tool for aggression rather than for defense. Because of this, bullying your way through at close-range is no longer a guaranteed victory and using a nice array of different moves is typically the only way you'll be able to dominate your opponents in the later rounds. As repeated attack patterns can and will be studied by your CPU opponents and will make countering or dodging your maneuvers that much easier.   Another added bonus is that certain attacks won't harm particular monsters regardless of how high their rating for that skill is -- as the increased attribute mechanics allow privileged individuals total immunity from techniques that correlate with their inherent element characteristics. Taken in stride with the points we mentioned above, this new system makes figuring out how to defeat another monster a lot harder than it used to be. Particularly when facing another human opponent.   Unfortunately that use of strategy doesn't always rub off on the A.I. competition and proves that harder doesn't necessarily mean ~hard~. Void of any truly challenging line of attack until your monster hits the B-class level or above, the biggest opponent in the early going will be your opponent's defensive rating. Of course, the challenge is a little higher when exploring caves and other such areas during the adventure segments, but veterans will most likely dominate these areas without much of a problem. Not to mention the fact that once they've mastered the new and very helpful team attacks (a multi-hit technique that allows players to use more than one monster in a single fight), victory is a forgone conclusion.    But that doesn't mean that the game isn't fun, because it is. Between the tournaments, adventures, and boss creatures, there's always plenty to see and even more to experience. Throw in the various minor upgrades like enhanced countering system, attribute increases, and customizable attack combinations and you have yourself the most playable Monster Rancher thus far.   Graphics  Rather than stick to the cel-shaded presentation of Monster Rancher 3, Part 4 has opted for a much more traditional look -- and the differences are more than welcome. Not only has this stylistic decision allowed Tecmo to create more intricate monster designs and additional realism to the production, it has also provided an opportunity for increased stage detail as well. The character models in particular are what really stand out, though: with an overly-emphasized style and personality that makes earlier entries in the series seem a bit boring. Though granted, human character designs are definitely on the generic side.   Yet despite these improvements, Monster Rancher 4 still has a long way to go before it can compete with contemporaries in terms of its visuals. Shadows, lighting, and creative use of filtering are almost entirely non-existent with special effects and super moves lacking the flair that graphic hounds crave. But to the game's credit, we never once experienced any slowdown or stutter and the load times between scenery were decidedly speedy. Take that for what you will.   Sound  Much like the previous Monster Rancher titles, this fourth installment doesn't provide much in terms of variety. Populated with a couple of low-key musical tunes, the majority of the game's soundtrack is almost entirely made up of horns, flutes, and the occasional acoustic guitar. For high-adrenaline listeners hoping for a little bit extra, however, there are a couple of circumstances where the soundtrack actually switches to more upbeat tempos; but those instances are almost exclusively heard when engaged in battles or faced with adventure bosses -- otherwise Monster Rancher 4 is all about the delicate ear treatment.   What really surprised us, though, is the complete lack of voice acting; especially when you consider how common such a thing is in this day and age. The sparse sound effects and limited audio bank isn't going to win any awards either; but at least it gets the job done and doesn't leave us in complete silence.Monster Rancher 4 still has a couple of areas that it can definitely improve upon, but for what it's worth, it's still an incredibly entertaining game. After all, a good portion of the fun can be had simply by searching for new monsters with your CD, DVD and videogame collection; and that doesn't even begin to touch upon the enjoyment found with the highly useable combat system and its deeper training regiment. Though we can't help to be reminded that the new adventure element, while effective, is distinctly under realized.As we mentioned in our cliched opener, though, Monster Rancher 4 isn't for every gamer out there anyway. But rather, it's the perfect fodder for the Pokemon and Magic Pengel crowd looking for the next step in the hardened world of battle games.
