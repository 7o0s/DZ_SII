Glu Mobile has already been enjoying a successful relationship with ace casual games maker PopCap, and now they've entered into another deal with PlayFirst, another superlative cas house. The first mobile game of the arrangement is Diner Dash, a waitress sim that will give you a serious challenge in bite-sized portions.   As Flo, the proprietor of a greasy spoon (but with ambitions that stretch much higher), you must serve a series of customers to earn tips. More tips mean more restaurant equipment, and eventually, more eating establishments. The flow of the game is seemingly simple: Customers enter, you seat them at appropriate tables, take their order, bring them their food, take them their check, and finally clear the table so another group can cool their heels. I say ~seemingly~ because after a few lunch shifts, Diner Dash ups the challenge significantly through a series of new game wrinkles.   You have to juggle a lot while serving customers. Customers don't like to wait for anything, whether it's to be seated, to get their food, or to get out of your diner. You have to monitor their happiness, and do everything you can to maintain their pleasure while maximizing your tips (more on this later). For example, you can earn a drink machine so you can serve customers a nice bev while you attend other business. Giving them a drink juices their happiness, buying you a little extra time. Don't abuse their good will, though. No matter if you served them a pre-meal drink, if you make them wait, the effects of the bev will be nullified.   Now, in order to succeed as a businesswoman, Flo must take measure to guarantee good tips. You'll notice that diners wear colored outfits. When the finish eating, they leave the seat the same color as their duds. To earn bonus points, you need to sit a customer wearing the same colored threads in their empty spot. If you can keep doing this over and over, you will see some amazing extras. This may require you to eat customers out of order, though. Get too greedy trying to make tips this way and you'll lose business.   Diner Dash needed a smart control system to keep the game moving. Without a mouse, Glu had to be inventive, and the system of attaching numbers to actions and tables works very well. If you're familiar with the number placement on your phone, you won't have a problem hitting the right keys. It's more a matter of hitting the right keys in a timely matter to keep the business running smoothly, delivering checks, taking orders, and busing tables.   I've mentioned before that I enjoyed Diner Dash's manic pacing. It really offers a great challenge without being frustrating or too stressful. You will sometimes find a groove and really watch the tips roll in. Miss a table or watch a customer storm out, and you'll get rattled and start making mistakes. This is especially bad if the food critic is in your joint.   The game recreates the look and atmosphere of the PC game with ease. Diner Dash was never a visual powerhouse, but it had serious personality and it's been translated quite well. The game features hand-drawn sprites and good audio.  Diner Dash is a winner. As a fan of the PC game, I really hoped Glu's mobile edition would successfully make the move -- and the end result is excellent. If you are looking for a relatively unique puzzle game that taxes your ability to put things in order (seat, get drinks, order, deliver food, take check, bus table, take order, get drinks, seat, etc.) and a fast pace, you'll have a blast with Diner Dash. It's the first must-download game of 2006.", "date": "Jan 3, 2006"}
