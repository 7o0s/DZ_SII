I've played through at least 15 games of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire for the Game Boy Color...and I didn't win the million. The most I've walked away with was a paltry $32,000. But that just goes to show how accurately the Game Boy Color version mimics the actual TV show  I can't win a million there, either. Features Six hundred trivia questions Full-motion video presentation Mimics the ABC gameshow Only for Game Boy Color  The massively popular game show that brought Regis Philbin out of the morning talk show circuit is really making the rounds -- from book to boardgame to PC to PlayStation. THQ smartly picked up this license for a Game Boy Color game, basing the title on the existing videogame renditions that hit the market over the past few months.  And just FYI, there is no Who Wants to be a Millionaire, First Edition for the Game Boy Color  this is the only edition of the game so far for the handheld. The Second Edition notes that the six hundred questions are lifted from the Second Edition of the PC and PlayStation renditions of the game. Easy as that.  Like the PC and PlayStation versions, the Game Boy Color edition mirrors the television show with a dramatic presentation  after difficult questions, the camera will pull back from the podium and zoom back in for the next question. It's all glitz, but for the Game Boy Color it's all well done through brief, detailed video clips. It's a high-pressure quiz game, and the presentation offers a similar feel  or at least what's possible on the small screen.  Unlike the PC and PlayStation versions, though, the only speech that's in the portable version happens when Regis walks on camera and asks ~Who wants to be a millionaire!~ That's the only time you hear digitized audio, and the only time you ever see Mr. Philbin show up in the game.  Still, the Game Boy Color system is definitely no slouch when it comes to adopting the game show. The pocket remake features all the elements that make Millionaire what it is. You get a round of 15 multiple-choice questions, each one more difficult than the last  the first five are the easiest, but then they get downright nasty. Answer all fifteen correctly and you walk home with a million-dollar check.  Thankfully you've got three lifelines at your disposal. First is the ask the audience poll  in the show, a hundred audience members answer the question for the contestant, and then the percentages show up. In the Game Boy Color version, the percentages are set  they're just revealed if ~Ask the Audience~ is selected. The second lifeline is the 50/50  two wrong answers are removed...and this is accurately represented on the portable rendition. Finally, phone a friend  in the show, you've got 30 seconds to talk to a buddy on the phone. On the Game Boy version, a ~friend~ tells you an answer via text at the bottom of the screen  and if it's not a definite answer, he'll say stuff like ~I'm not sure, but...~ so you have to be careful.  The game has a multi-player mode in the form of the ~fastest fingers~ challenge, but it's a solo trivia game exactly like the game show. The fastest fingers mode is pretty cool in its own right, much like the ~Jack Attack~ mode in the PC versions of ~You Don't Know Jack.~ You're presented a task of picking the proper order  like US states from the smallest to the largest. When you see the right order shuffle in front of you, you have to press the A button. Then, hand the system over to another person, who's given the same task. You can do this for up to four people  the person who picked the correct one the quickest gets sent to the hot seat.  The downside to the Game Boy Color game is the fact that there are only six hundred questions in the database  and because the cartridge doesn't have a battery save, it's completely random when you'll see a question repeated. I went five separate games before I saw a repeat question...but then I saw the same question three different times over the course of fifteen straight games. If THQ sprung for a battery or SRAM, it would have made the replay value a little better than it ended up with.   Despite its shortened longevity, Who Wants to be a Millionaire is a decent trivia game for the Game Boy Color that captures the essence of the game show pretty darn well. Just don't expect any banter from Regis  but maybe that's a good thing.", "date": "Oct 4, 2000"}
