Hits such as MechAssault and NFL 2K3 ensured a booming Xbox Live community; it was a little taste of what the PC world has been enjoying for years. However, there was one thing missing: an online RPG. Now that we mention it, Xbox's current RPG lineup isn't exactly spectacular. Growing still, the list of RPGs released is fairly slim. None of them are online.  That is until now. Microsoft and Sega have released Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II. Like an encyclopedia, the franchise grows in content and competency with each release. The original Dreamcast PSO, the first online console RPG, was just the test subject. Since then, Sega has ramped up its content and polish with newer iterations; Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2 (Dreamcast) and Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II have noticeably new content.  However, it's not major leaps we're seeing, even if advancement is visible. On Xbox, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II is the same game it was on GameCube, only with a few notable technological differences, voice communication ability, and a different way of strapping your bank account. In other words, while Phantasy Star Online is still a wonderful online experience, especially with voice chat on Xbox Live, it's still not receiving the improvements it needs as time goes by.  PSO is the best it has ever been on Xbox, making it a must-have for its cult-like following, but for everyone else there are a lot of factors to consider.  The Facts Xbox's first online RPG Real-time battle mechanics; cast magic and coordinate attacks in a perpetually active world In-game PSO supports four players simultaneously Huge community with thousands of players -- visit various lobbies, hang out, chat, form guilds, trade items, engage in Lobby Ball matches, or duel one-on-one Feature-rich: voice chat, create shortcuts for text chatting, custom symbols, sentence creator, trade ~ID~ cards, send mail, and much more Versatile character creation tool with four classes and 12 different character types Three character types, Hunter, Ranger, and Force, as well as the races human, newman, and android Episode I brings content from both previous Dreamcast games Episode II makes the new title more than just a rehash, featuring brand new levels, bosses, weapons and quests Explore six diversely-themed worlds, including the new beach and mountain territories Four-player splitscreen offline mode Progressive scan support In-game Dolby Digital support Supports third-party keyboards with USB adapter $8.95 a month-to-month service fee Must subscribe to Xbox Live, even to play offline   Gameplay Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II is an online role-playing game that takes elements of the previous Dreamcast versions and expands upon them. It's not an entirely new game, but Sonic Team, the developer, likes to think of it that way; Episode I is a slightly tweaked and upgraded version of Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Online Version 2. Episode II is completely new, originally designed for the GameCube release and ported identically to Xbox. For those not familiar with the series, PSO is a living, breathing world, a futuristic paradise that gamers with Internet access can escape to. There are some basic storyline elements: a peoples' home planet is destroyed and a pioneer mission to find a new world is formed. With a few catastrophes and twists, there's enough to reason to feel compelled to explore the dangerous worlds before you, but mostly, as the name of the series indicates, this is an online game. Only the most hardcore players will have any regard for the story.   Not the prettiest Xbox game, but definitely home to an eye-catching art style.  In fact, it's so clearly an online title that, for the Xbox version, you must subscribe to Xbox Live to play Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II. It cautions you this on the front of the box. Your unique gamertag and password are required to even reach the main menu. It's an extremely odd request of Microsoft and Sega. The translation is that PSO for Xbox is a very expensive investment -- roughly $100 including the monthly subscription fee. On the plus side, you do get two free months of play. This is likely Sega's way of hoping to get gamers so addicted and invested in the community that they'll just hang on to the subscription. The interesting thing is that Sega does not maintain the servers like it did with the Dreamcast and does with the GameCube version. That's all part of Microsoft's duties. A representative defended the service saying, ~a Hunter's License is required, which gives gamers access to a plethora of exclusive content such as seasonal quests, downloads and rare in-game items.~ In our opinion, halving the monthly fee for the Hunter's License would have been a more sincere effort by Sega given the extra investment into Xbox Live.     Getting back into the gameplay itself, the dynamics are pretty straightforward. The whole process of playing PSO begins with creation your character. You can choose from a total of 12 different character types that fall under three character classes: Hunter, Ranger, and Force. In that order, the classes accommodate powerful close-combat, long-range support, and magic casting and variable support. Depending on what kind of fighter you create, you'll be able to handle different weaponry and body armor. It affects your health, magic reserves, and a number of other things. There's a lot of diversity, which goes even deeper once you choose the appearance of your character; this can vary in countless ways. We'd have to say we're very satisfied with the character creation tool. From body proportions to hair color, the process is intuitive and flexible. It also has many more additions since it resided on Dreamcast.  However, this is also a perfect example of how PSO is still stagnating as it arrives on Xbox. There's no promise of downloading new character creation content, which would have been a very nice upgrade for the Xbox.  Once you create your perceived self in the world of Phantasy Star, things become very interesting. The dynamics of your ability to use items, weapons, and magic are readily apparent when you team up with other players in the online world. Hunters will have to look danger in the face and provide hand-to-hand combat support, while Rangers will have to sync up attacks from afar. The fighting engine is completely real-time, as it would be in a real world. There's no pausing, save for retreating to a safer area left behind you. It sets the stage for really intense battles. This is something that may clash with fans looking for the traditional turn-based RPG, but trust us; Phantasy Star Online is not a world that would benefit from such a thing. However, this battle system requires a few important things -- flexible controls, a good camera system, and the ability to easily communicate with your team members.   Let's start from the top. Regarding the control system for battling, Sonic Team has created something pretty accommodating. Basic attacks include quick, light assaults and heavy, but slower ones. You can link the two together into three-tier combos. For example light-light-heavy or light-heavy-light would be combo attacks. Timing plays a part in performing them, and it's all diversified by the weapon type your using. In other words, combo attacks do require skill and dexterity. It's not a sloppy system by any means. However, as time passes, we do think that it's obvious that Sonic Team needs to make improvements. Years after the Dreamcast version, the battle mechanics have not really deepened, and that's a major detriment to the series. For instance, there is still no way to really perform controlled attacks on multiple characters. It's like skeet shooting; you just have to line everything up.    Want to attain level 200 like this guy? It might take you a good year.  There are a total of six slots for battle shortcuts using the X, A, and B buttons in addition to holding the R-trigger in combination. It's hardly a perfect system, but it works and it's intuitive. If you need to change weapons mid-battle, this can be easier and faster than you may imagine. Just tap the Black or White button to access the menu and use the right analog stick to surf through it and select what you want; meanwhile, you can dodge enemy attacks and run for cover with the left analog stick. It takes some time getting used to, and may very well cause you to go cross-eyed, but the functionality is appreciated. It also could have gone deeper. There's no ability to hold the R-trigger and L-trigger at the same time for a third set of customizable actions. Furthermore, players MAGs -- a small creature that aids every player -- gain uber-powerful ~photon blasts~ that become mapped to the R+A action set. When you earn it, you have total control over when you use it, but you'll be unable to access whatever action you set in that place until that time.      Then there is the issue of the ever-troublesome third-person camera. For PSO Episode I & II, you are able to control the camera with the L-trigger. This works moderately well in single-player, but when you throw in the fact that there are multiple enemies on-screen at once as well as teammates, the problems are obvious. It becomes difficult to keep track of what is going on. It also becomes a battle on its own to just to target the enemies. To alleviate some of this stress there is a subtle lock-on that happens automatically, but it's nothing as intelligent as something like the Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time introduced. In fact, more than often it becomes downright frustrating because you can't target the enemy you'd like to. Even worse, the gigantic size of the bosses presents much larger problems. There have been times when the camera has displayed blank canyon walls while we fumbled in the search to locate the boss's location. We've been looking forward to a time when Sonic Team refines the gameplay mechanics and weeds out these problems, but it still isn't happening -- even six months after we last saw this title on GameCube.  In the midst of these strenuous battles and throughout the whole online adventure, it becomes very important to communicate with teammates. This is where the beauty of the Xbox Live program comes in. The revolution of voice chat gives PSO exactly what it has been missing since its inception. To be able to communicate in low lag environments makes the experience a lot more entertaining. Topics of conversation can vary wildly from trading newly acquired items, requesting support, suggesting a retreat, to just talking about random things to pass the time. Experiencing the community is half the fun.   Since this is a standard of Xbox Live, everybody can benefit from it. However, for those who don't feel comfortable talking or cannot talk, they will still be able to use any third-party keyboard if they purchase the USB adapter for Xbox, which is available through a send-in offer included in the game. There are numerous shortcuts included for communication, as well. There is a software keyboard built-in. You can use the analog stick and D-pad to surf around the keys to type. You can also pre-program shortcuts to the D-pad and the F1-F12 keys (also on the software keyboard). Unfortunately, space is limited for characters, so the phrases you piece together can't be too long. So, there is yet another option. You can piece together pre-made phrases. This function has a bit of artificial intelligence to it, so if someone dies a suggested reply might prioritize itself on the list. The list is accessed by quickly tapping Y and then X. Again, though, usage is limited and requires a lot of memorization to make it useful. There is also symbol communication, which lets you send messages in the form of smiley faces and the like. You can even build your own ~logos~ and custom faces, but that will only get you so far. It's really just for fun.   In the end, Xbox Live's voice support is what makes PSO best on Xbox. Anyone who buy's the game should be doing so for its expansive community, and talking without the aid of keyboards makes this all the more lovely. Without this thriving community, the game may still be a slightly better than average RPG with real-time battle mechanics, but it will lose its appeal very quickly.   There are a few other odds and ends to discuss about the Xbox version. While it still supports two- to four-player offline gaming with friends, it does not take advantage of the system link functionality. Of course, with a forced subscription to Xbox Live and Sega's services, there's really no need for it -- especially with the nearly lagless broadband connection. But, let's say you do want to go over to a friend's place and play in the same room on a split screen. You'll have to move your character to your memory unit if you want to cart it around. The process is pretty simple. However, due to a translation problem the game will read ~Data Transferring~ instead of ~Data Transferred.~ This presents a very big problem. It's totally unintuitive. It will appear that your character has never been moved at all, and you could wait for days for it to happen. Microsoft noted that it is aware of the problem, and is looking for ways to notify those who purchase the title of it. All we know is it definitely played quite the mind trick on us.        In the end, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II is one of the better RPGs within the Xbox library. It's also the only online RPG right now, and it's probably the best PSO yet with the incredibly handy voice chat. However, it is certainly not perfect and begins to show its age with each iteration we see. From camera frustrations to outdated visuals to not taking advantage of Xbox hardware, PSO is not what it could be on the console. The bulk of the replay value is in the community, the downloadable quests, and the constant urge to gain experience and new weaponry. The only complaint we have is that eventually you will have visited the locales of the world many times. As well, the battles do become redundant with the only dynamic being who you're fighting alongside and how you go about it.   We're ready for a true sequel to PSO that takes advantage of next-generation software. Not more rehashes. This latest version definitely comes highly recommended for anyone interested in the online RPG scene and especially for any PSO fanatic. You can easily spend a month or two enjoying the online experience. However, for the rest, it may be worth waiting to see how future online RPGs fare.    Graphics There's no escaping the fact that Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II is a port of an existing Dreamcast engine. Sonic Team has not performed a major engine overhaul here, and it could hardly be called impressive by Xbox standards. Textures are moderately detailed (better than the previous PSOs), blurry and divided by seams at times. Likewise, there are notable collision detection problems, nasty pop-in, and a lack of any kind of effects coding for the Xbox hardware.    On a more positive note, however, Sonic Team has a pretty stunning art vision that overpowers a lot of these flaws. Vividly colored with some obvious influences from the movie Blade Runner, the style is in a class of its own. Many objects are painted with neon lighting or flat, but clean texture designs. At certain points, highly futuristic buildings stand tall next to beautiful vistas of green jungles or seasides. There are a lot of subtle environmental effects too -- rain, fog, and even water effects. Running at 30 frames per second with it's share of visual scars, the engine still reminds us it's got a lot of mileage on it. But, we love the look, and can't wait to see how it may evolve with future installments of the series.   A believable futuristic world, indeed.  HDTV enthusiasts will also be pleased to hear the title benefits greatly from the implementation of progressive scan support. The already vibrant art design becomes even more crisp and clean. Unfortunately, there is no widescreen support.  Sound Episode I & II comes without voiceovers for non-player characters, so much of the sound design focus is on soundtrack composition and effects. For the music, Sonic Team has created some pretty rich themes for the various environments. There really weren't any we disagreed with and the quality is very well done. It's even interactive, so as you travel into different situations the music changes in a heartbeat. Also, as a special treat when you go on special quests there are bonus tracks Sega fans will hear such as music from Sonic Adventure 2, for example. It's pretty catchy at first, but unfortunately it repeats itself and can also become annoying. In those instances, it would have been nice to have the option to shuffle back to the regular music.  Or, hey, how about this? Since Sonic Team has no problem touting totally ill-themed hits such as Sonic songs now and then, why couldn't we use Xbox's custom soundtrack capabilities. Seriously, it's things like this that disappoint us and scream, ~Hey, PSO wasn't made for Xbox.~ The music gets annoying, and it would have been an incredible addition to have a ~radio~ feature built in.   For sound effects there's a lot of futuristic beeps and buzzes, electrical tones, and the like. It's quite fitting for the worlds and there are a lot of enemy-specific sounds that are very clever. On one level you'll hate them because you know it means danger, but on the other hand you'll also have the benefit of recognition. All this is featured in Dolby Digital if your home theater supports it, which actually sounds great Especially for environment effect -- you'll hear the ocean crashing around in you the seaside level, or people's footsteps separated in the four corners of your room.  Overall, a job well done, but something like a customizable soundtrack would have earned serious brownie points. This is a direct port of the GameCube version...which is a direct port of the Dreamcast version with the all-new Episode II levels. The only real benefits come in the form of basic technical enhancements, broadband only gameplay, and, the best thing of all, voice chat. Voice communication is what makes PSO addicting all over again, despite its lack of enhancements.However, with numerous camera problems ,daily, and other Xbox-specific utilizations nowhere to be found, I also am disappointed. Six months later than the GameCube debut of the same game, all we get is voice chat and higher subscription fees. This in combination with the aforementioned lack of advancements is cause for a lower review score for the Xbox version. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty much the best PSO yet, but it's aging. We can't ignore that.Nonetheless, I highly recommend this to everyone interested in RPGs and Xbox Live. It's a one-of-a-kind package right now...if you can foot the bill.", "date": "Apr 16, 2003"}
