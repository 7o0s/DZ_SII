Of course, Banjo, Conker, and Joanna are all sure to make their way at some point in time, but which game would come first? The once-Gamecube title Kameo? A new Battletoads game? Well, neither, actually. The first Xbox game to be delivered from the hands of the much-hyped Rare is Grabbed by the Ghoulies, a simple beat'em-up outfitted in an appropriately timed monsters clothing. Surprised? Yeah, us too.There are many expectations and even more anticipation for the first Rare title on Microsoft's console. With a track record that includes some true gaming classics, to be being bought for four hundred or so million dollars, this game better be good, and more importantly, show off what Rare is capable of doing. Well, Grabbed by the Ghoulies isn't quite what we were expecting in terms of presentation, structure, or quality, but the game does have its moments and should appeal to fans of the genre.LoadingPlayGameplaySo you're out on a romantic walk with your woman when all of the sudden she's grabbed by a group of ghoulies. Now you've got to rescue her. A typical save-the-princess storyline, but it works considering the theme of the game. On your search-and-rescue mission, you take the role of a young boy named Cooper. Your quest will take you into every room and periphery building of Ghoulhaven Hall, a haunted house of sorts. The story, while at times interesting and somewhat humorous, doesn't really have a script that's compelling or captivating for anyone over the age of six. But that's not really why you're playing this game now, is it?Love Rare? Fearful of Ghoulies? Want more reasons to love Kaiser? You can get even more Grabbed by the Ghoulies opinion and fact from our Video Review for Rare's first Xbox title. At the very least you're getting some super fat high resolution movies and that's just plain irresistible.The game's level structure is like this: You enter a new room/area of the house. The doors shut and your job is to beat the challenge given to you, which is more often than not to defeat all of the enemies in the room under a strict set of parameters. As each challenge begins, one or more icons will appear in the corner of the screen These tell the player what they can or cannot do for the challenge. For instance, sometimes you'll have to defeat all enemies of a certain breed. Other times you'll have to alternate between monster types, while other challenges require you to use only weapons. Breaking any of the rules will call forth the Grim Reaper, an annoying monster that will seek you out and kill you with one touch. He can be avoided, but considering some of the chaotic battles, that can be very difficult to do.Another element added to each challenge to spice things is power-ups. Sometimes found laying out in the open, sometimes found hidden in breakable objects, these power-ups can turn the tide of battle. You'll find invisibility power-ups, one-hit kills, and even ones that will automatically end the challenge. But you'll have to watch out for the anti-power-ups - items that will make things much more difficult for you, like reversed controls or power drains. Also, almost every structure in each room is destructible to an extent. Breaking, say a table, will often reward the player with power-ups, though sometimes enemies will pop out. This encourages exploration to a degree, and you'll have to take a gamble on each and every thing you break.Lastly, every room has a number of weapons strewn about that can be used in battle. From boxes to books to even hamburgers, these melee and projectile weapons not only come in handy because of their strength and range, but are sometimes required if the rules call for only weapons.Now, all of these things - the rules, the power-ups, the weapons - seem to be in place to make each battle more strategy-oriented rather than just punch, punch, kick, and for the most part, it does. You'll definitely have to pay close attention to what you're allowed to do, and the power-ups can be real life-savers or life-killers, so watching where you're running is a must. The problem is, though, oftentimes there's so much going on that it's too easy to accidentally break a rule and cause the Grim Reaper - the source of many, many deaths - to appear. Get used to dying a lot because you'll find yourself in situations where death is simply unavoidable -- not a good thing.Other factors in the game's frustrating equation are the controls, camera, and auto-targeting. First, we'll start with the controls. Using a scheme that is becoming more standard these days, the left analog stick moves your character while the right stick is used for attacks. Just press in the direction of the enemy and voila, you'll punch and kick and dropkick your way through the baddies. It's simple and accessible, but lacks depth. Throw in a lack of defensive maneuvers and it only becomes shallower.Then comes the camera controls. Because the right stick is used for attacks, the L and R triggers are used to sweep the camera left and right. Not necessarily a bad system, but the confined rooms filled to the brim with objects can often make the camera get into some strange positions. The fact that enemies are attacking you from all sides only makes trying to find the optimal angle even that much more frustrating.Complementing the sometimes-odd camera and controls is the subtle auto-targetng used in the game. Cooper will usually turn and face the closest enemy, or even objects, and this can be a problem. For example, when you're trying to run away from an enemy you can feel the auto-targeting locking on, slightly pulling the view in the general direction. This makes running away a chore at times, especially since you'll often be running backwards due to the auto-targeting.But even with its problems, Grabbed by the Ghoulies' presentation is pretty killer, despite the love-it-or-hate-it art style. The best example of this is the cutscenes, which are told in a storybook format and use animated panels. Also, there a few subtle lines and such in the game that bring back the humor found in Rare's N64 classic, Conker's Bad Fur Day; there are mentions of a Neede-in-the-Nuts town fair; there's an item called dungweed which looks exactly as you might expect; a character known as Mr. Ribs is referred to as Boner; Cooper's idle animations have him picking his nose and ears and eating the presents left on his finger. He'll even scratch his own bottom thinking no one is watching him. Then, of course, there's the title of the game itself which should be self explanatory. Yeah, we like the humor.GraphicsRare games have consistently been technologically impressive, and Grabbed by the Ghoulies is no different. The game's unique brand of cel-shading creates just the right tone for the game -- something in between a Saturday morning cartoon and a Tim Burton flick - and the art style is definitely a bit hokey. Yes, the spikey-haired blonde lead of the game is a bit generic, and many of the other characters suffer a similar fate, but on a whole the artistic direction works in the context of the game; when you play a game that revolves around a haunted house and monsters, it's like you expect to see certain horror archetypes.There's plenty more to like about Grabbed by the Ghoulies' visuals. With copious amounts of real-time reflections, fancy particle effects, a great soft bodies physics model, moody lighting, and highly expressive animations, your visual senses never cease to be stimulated. Our biggest complaint would have to be in regards to the simplistic character and enemy models, and there are bound to be a number of you out there who could do without the art style, but you do eventually grow use to it after playing the game for a while. Also, there's a hint of slowdown every once in a while, but it's nothing to write home about.SoundGrabbed by the Ghoulies scores again with its great soundtrack. Eerie and, um, ghoulish, the tunes throughout the game are less macabre and more Monster Mash, evoking a bit of humor most of the time. In conjunction with the graphics, the music sets the mood perfectly for a slightly corny monster-bashing game with ambient sounds, disturbing piano lines, and really great harpsichord and xylophone segments. And who could leave out the requisite shrieks and shrills that define a ghoulish experience.Like some other Rare games, the voice acting in the game is not really composed of spoken lines, but rather expressive grunts and other ambiguous sounds, with text used to convey the explicit message. While true voice acting is always appreciated, we get the feeling that the method used in the game was for the better. Not only does it seem to make the game a bit funnier, but with some of the lines in the game, as well as the characters that would have to deliver them, we're not sure we want to hear them spoken.Our biggest beef with the game's sound is the lack of variety. Too often it seems that you're hearing the same tune for the thirtieth time. We would've liked to have heard a bit more range in the soundtrack so we weren't always feeling so...ghouly.Grabbed by the Ghoulies isn't a bad game, but it's far from great. If you were to picture the game's progression as a line graph, it would start as a shallow incline and then level out for the remainder of the game. Simply put, the game is very repetitive, and there aren't any landmark moments or climaxes to diversify the gameplay in any significant matter. And then there's the end of the game - which I'll remain mum on -- which really feels like a tacked-on segment, and is just plain silly. But what GBTG has going for it is some really great presentation; the storybook cutscenes, graphics, and sounds are very well done, and the simple controls make it a game that can be simply picked up and played by anyone. Is that enough to make the game a must-play? Not really. We recommend renting it first and deciding for yourself if being grabbed the ghoulies is something you enjoy.", "date": "Oct 24, 2003"}
