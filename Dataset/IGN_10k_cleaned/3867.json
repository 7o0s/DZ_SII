Paramount's heist flick is being re-released into theaters in hopes of finally breaking that $100M box office barrier.  (Perhaps if the McDonald's menu of a trailer hadn't given away every single plot twist, this new rollout wouldn't have been necessary.)  Speaking of what is and isn't necessary, Mforma has unleashed a celly tie-in game across several carrier networks based on the almost-hit film. Does it warrant the four-dollar download, or are we just on the sorry end of the robbery?  Features:  Driving action Based on Paramount's film, ~The Italian Job~ Three levels of difficulty  Well, let's answer that previous question right now. The Italian Job is a slick little surprise of a game that offers some fun, genuine game play on your handset.  We tested the game on a Samsung N400, one of the bottom 3Gs available, and still had a good time navigating the so-called streets of Los Angeles, attempting to steal our gold back from evil Steve.  The game mirrors the final act of the film. Climb behind the wheel of a Mini Cooper and take to the streets of LA, hunting down an armored truck full of stolen gold.  There are three trucks, two are decoys.  You must find the real truck before taking too much damage.  Once you manage to snag the real truck, you must then race back to the metro tunnel, and then transport the gold to train yards for a tidy getaway.  This is one bizarro-world version of Los Angeles, as the sprawling metropolis has been reduced to a neat and tidy grid -- and for anybody who has driven in Hell-Ay, you know that just isn't the case. Use the directional pad to steer, trying to avoid potholes that could bury a pachyderm. Fortunately, tracking the mission goals -- armored trucks, metro tunnel, and train yards -- isn't the horrible crapshoot it could have been.  Kind of like Grand Theft Auto, there are colored icons on the outskirts of the screen that show you what general direction your goal is. And as soon as you manage to steal back the gold, red dots display where Steve's motorcycle goons are coming from.  You have three Minis at your disposal, so if you take too much damage, skirt back to the rendezvous point to switch vehicles. And if the two-wheeled henchmen get too close, you can ditch gold bars to trip them up.  Visually, the game isn't terribly thrilling, but months of lowered expectations from lame-looking cell games helps The Italian Job's case considerably.  The city reminds you of the city from the old C64 Ghostbusters game.  Your Mini actually takes up both sides of the street.  Silly, yes.  But understandable to make the game playable. I'll give it to you straight here: I enjoyed this handset version far more than the boring, cookie-cutter console game released earlier this summer.  Mforma and nGame recognized the limitations of handset hardware and crafted a fun, clever game within the presented boundaries.  Give it a download -- it's one of the btter movie-licensed celly games available.", "date": "Aug 27, 2003"}
