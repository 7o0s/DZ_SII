Granted, it's a flawed deity, one with idealized prophesies that failed to come to being, and one we'll surely persecute and crucify once another idol arrives. But worship we must, for WWF Smackdown is indeed a god amongst all other heretic PlayStation wrestling games.   In THQ's slacked hands, this the Americanized version of creed, where messiahs and spiritualists are displaced by fat men delivering shiny wrapped gifts. Many who believed in the Smackdown Santa and begged for something alive and real will still yearn for that living puppy they wished for and were told was coming. But, for the here and now, know that Smackdown is a bevy of presents under your tree -- think big-screen TV, sub-woofed stereo, a shiny new Beamer, tickets to Disneyland, and gobs of candy. Maybe next year all your dreams will come true, but until then, there be presents to plunder here!  The Show THQ had a lot to prove here, after looting the WWF license from longtime partner Acclaim. You don't break 10 years of tradition without catching a few suspicious eyes, so the stakes were high on Smackdown (OK, it would have sold anyway, but wrestling is nothing without drama, so let me do my job). Wisely, THQ went to the Japanese wrestling ring masters at Yukes and appropriated the Toukon Retsuden 4 (All Japan Pro Wrestling) engine to create this game. The proven success of that series is probably Smackdown's greatest asset -- it has four years of training behind it, and the quality shows.  But there needed to be something more. THQ had to match WWF Attitude blow by blow. Then it needed to get over completely with a knockout blow. That finisher comes in two forms: revolutionary gameplay options so awesome they'll bring back fond memories of the first time players ever tied up in a four-player brawl, and an evolutionary Season mode that brings all the drama, excitement, fear, and heat that makes this sports entertainment so gripping week in and week out.   If you're asking for modes, there is no question: Smackdown reigns supreme. Acclaim made some headway with Lumberjack and Royal Rumble battles, but in Smackdown that's all standard issue. Then the rebellion begins, with incredible modes like the Anywhere Falls match and I Quit match. Backstage areas aren't just boxes like in EA's WCW Mayhem -- they're full fledged, interconnected rooms, complete with lethal props and dangerous corners. Toss somebody through the stage curtains in Anywhere Falls and you'll be backstage in the briefing halls, complete with hospital gurney on the side for injuries (which, of course, can be rammed into an opponent to cause such an injury).   Throw them further and they'll land in the parking lot, with concrete pillars and cars to crack heads on. It's all very natural and extremely fun to play through. And while THQ hasn't matched Acclaim's ho-hum First Blood mode, the I Quit match (where you have to shove a microphone down your opponent's throat until he gives) is a blast, and the Special Referee mode is the best thing to happen to wrestling since Hogan. As the ref, you control the count -- tap quickly if your buddy is over, or hold the count entirely if you don't like the guy on the pin. In multiplayer, this mode alone can cause real wrestling matches to break out!  It's the Story mode that disappoints, and starts to show the seams in an otherwise great game. Regrettably, this is the feature that both THQ and we in the business have hyped as the game's key, and it's failing makes the game lose a lot of appeal. Smackdown was pretty much programmed in Japan, turned over to the American art team, and then put on shelves (mostly, sorta). How does this matter? Let me put it to you this way: many Japanese no speak English so well. Smackdown's Story is riddled by putrid lines and go-nowhere affairs. Wrestlers don't even have dialog -- they just go up to each other back stage, and then a text block pops up pondering ~You know, I wonder what [So-and-So] and [Whats-his-Face] are talking about?~ Yeah, me too. Maybe we'll find out in Smackdown 2? Perhaps then THQ will pony up the $4.50 an hour it would have taken to hire some wrestling fan boy with a week's worth of C++ programming to write down some trash talk and put it in a text string. In other words, the back stage rivalries and conversations were limited and the actual backstage functions disappointing.  The Card Thirty-six wrestling superstars (including three hot chicks), each with his own skills, move sets, and keyframed animation sequences? This is a good thing. WWF Smackdown's roster is piled high with talent, and each character looks and moves incredible. Characters even move their lips and eyes -- The Rock's eyebrow twitch is in the game! From the opening entrance sequence (which takes a wholly original and creative approach to the all-important entrance) to the finishing moves and ending celebrations, the game's characters perfectly capture their real-life counterparts. Seeing Stone Cold slug his opponent, twist his neck around and drop him in the Stunner, then leap up on the ring posts with his middle finger raised high... That's something we haven't seen in quite a while, due to Austin's injuries, and having it back on the screen brought tears to many eyes at IGN Wrestling.  The other side of the card is the Create-a-Wrestler mode. It's not nearly as deep as the Warzone/Attitude series, but the feature will still let you build the ultimate freaky fellow or roughneck homie. Acclaim focused on the cosmetics with their Frankenstein feature, while THQ has instead gone for a more focused approach. We'll all miss being able to customize ever aspect of our creation's face (Smackdown just lets you choose a head), but here the skill builder is phenomenally balanced -- a good trade. With only so many points to work with, fantasy wrestlers must be carefully designed to unlock the higher-level moves. For instance, if you blow all your points on a powerful wrestler, you'll only have a few points left for aerial stunts, and your big lug will never be able to moonsault opponents off the top turnbuckle. Turned the other way around, your high-flying crazy will have the basic body slam available for power moves, and that's it.  Create-a-Wrestler is also the gateway to the game's secret characters, but this is a big disappointment, too. Instead of unlocking new characters, you unlock new heads to put on new creations. Sure, you could build Jacqueline if you really wanted to, but to do so, you must find her head, body, and legs, name her and give her a nickname, figure out her skill levels, assign her character types, and pick out all of her moves. Very frustrating, time consuming, and idiotic. THQ should have unlocked the characters once the name is entered (and the secret is unlocked), but things don't work that easy.  But the Create-a-Wrestler mode is also tied brilliantly (although shallowly) into the Season mode. Once you build a creation, they must fight in a Pre-Season year to build their skills and make their alliances. Adversaries will call you out, and if you prove yourself they will offer their devotion. This is how you make friends for the Season mode -- and it's also the way you make enemies, because you can always tell them to bugger off! Allies will be your tag partner when needed, and can come out to make a save when you're down. Enemies will dog you until the ends of the earth, constantly tying you up in the ring and unexpectedly beating you down backstage. What's missing in this equation is the ability to make new enemies or win a friendship -- once you battle the Pre-Season, you can never go back, and your friends and foes are set in stone. Even so, it's an awesome feature that just begs for more development next time out.  The Game Once in the ring, all hell breaks loose in Smackdown, but it's controlled chaos thanks to the perfect wrestling engine. Tapping attacks and KI combos are completely wrong for wrestling, and Yukes' effort proves that with its time-based grappling. Grapples, attacks, counterattacks, and stunts are all easily and logically controlled, and matches really look like the real thing. Best of all, the control captures the real thing -- This is a sport that's all about timing, and here moves and counters must be timed entirely differently from the standard wrestling button mashers.  It's not a perfect game, not by a long shot, but everything the game does well in the gameplay department is a key step forward for the genre to gain cred against its popularity. Wrestlers no longer clip through each other like jello bodies, as the collision detection is spot on, in most cases. Button mashing can be countered by a skilled player. Weapons each act differently (you can even see Big Boss Man twirl the night stick). Going against the game is the fact that, even though animation is keyframed to avoid the restrictions of motion capture, characters cannot hit each other when they are in the middle of most moves. A tag partner can not come in and make a save when his team mate is being held in the air by Kane for a choke slam -- he must wait for the sequence to finish and hope that the devastating move doesn't knock his friend out completely. This lack also makes for sloppy multiplayer games, as characters become invisible to each other once a grapple has begun, but the variety of modes more than make up for this flaw, and -- to be fair -- other wrestling games have the same fault.  The Look Again, there are top notch graphics in THQ's effort. If there is one reason to recommend this game over the Acclaim series, it's the fact that the wrestlers sell their moves. It's unbelievable that, now three games into the Acclaim series, their characters still lie dead after being slammed to the canvas. In Smackdown, characters snap their heads, grab their backs, pound the canvas, and beg for mercy.  Any wrestling fan will tell you that the sell (making it look like a hit hurt you)is the key to making wrestling look as awesome and destructive as it is, and the addition of selling to Smackdown is just the finisher on top of a finely performed graphic engine. Colors are a bit too bold sometimes, and the ring is too small, but otherwise the visuals are perfect. As already mentioned, character animation is incredible, but so is the depth in the audience (which is framey but at least looks good and stretches far back into the stadium), the variety of back stage arenas (including a boiler room with swinging lights), the realism of the ring ropes, and the quality of the facial features (complete with animated hair and mouths). The quality surpasses even the N64 game, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 -- truly impressive.   The Talk Where Smackdown stalls out completely is in the audio presentation. There are no, repeat no, voice samples from wrestlers. Characters meet each other backstage with lip synch that moves to no voice at all. That's excusable, seeing as how difficult it would be to coordinate all of that voice, and how quickly it would all get boring. There is no excuse for a lack of play-by-play commentary. Acclaim's color commentary by Jerry ~The King~ Lawler was the best thing about Warzone, and it is sorely missed here. However, in my personal preference, THQ made the right choice by skipping the voice samples for ring action. Try as they might to harmonize action and voice, Acclaim's and EA's voice samples clashed harshly with the wrestling in the game. Voices didn't seem to come from the wrestlers or the action in front of us -- they were just floating phrases coming from nowhere. Taken as a whole, the lesser-is-more approach makes for a better soundtrack, but the loss of Lawler is felt deeply. The man wrestled Andy Kaufman -- he should be in every wrestling game.You will buy it. There's nothing I can say to change that (hell, you all bought  ECW Hardcore Revolution -- what did I tell you!) But this time, I don't want to tell you otherwise. Smackdown looks and plays great. It's a fine game. There, I've said it. There is such a thing as a good wrestling game, and this is one. Woe be to all.However, the game gets tiresome very early, and that's thanks almost entirely due to THQ's treatment of it. The fact that the season mode is a never-ending chore rather than a spellbinding action soap opera really takes much of the wind out of this game's sails. The mode was promised to be spectacular and ground-breaking, but most gamers will instantly recognize that everything done in Smackdown was done almost as well in N64's WWF Wrestlemania (also by THQ). Even though there are some very rad special sequences (Undertaker has a particular one all his own where he performs a ritual with his burning symbol), after a few years into the season I just wanted to turn it all off (which you can't). I'll write that off to rushed game design this time, but it still drags down an otherwise awesome game. But the bottom line is that WWF Smackdown is, far and away, the best wrestling game on PlayStation. It gives some to the N64 Wrestlemania game's tighter controls and crisper animation, but Smackdown is no slouch in either department, and it even bests Wrestlemania in graphics and features. This is the kind of game that makes you look at everything that came before it as a long trip toward a dead end. Finally, there is open road ahead in PlayStation wrestling, and it all started here, with the words ~good wrestling game.~", "date": "Mar 2, 2000"}
