Maybe I've played too many games at this point. Maybe I need to refresh my views on what makes a good video game. Or maybe 3DO just needs to stop making these damn Army Men games. The idea stopped being original years ago along with everything else that is in this game. Nothing here is original and the worst part is that it isn't even cute anymore. The Tan and Green armies are just going at each other in the plastic world and not in our oversized human world. So whatever charm and fun that the game ever claimed to have is totally gone now. All that is left is a way below average squad based strategy game.  Where should I begin? The dated graphics? The frustrating interface? The terrible sound? Ugh. Well, in the interest of conserving time and energy, and in honor of an unoriginal and boring game, I'll adopt that tried and true formulaic approach to reviewing and just go through the points step by step.  Presentation If you didn't look very closely, you might think this was the exact same menu system from the other Army Men games. Not even this aspect of the game underwent an upgrade. All corners were cut. It's like they were trying to make it hard for you to get excited about playing this game. Luckily enough, the menu system is easy to get around, so it is easy to actually get into the meat of the game. Not that there's all that much meat.  Graphics The visuals in this game make me long for the pixilated graphics of the Super Nintendo. It's always been a thought of mine if you are making a whole new game in a franchise, and not just creating an expansion pack, then you should actually put forth some effort to create new graphics and, hell let's go crazy, a new engine. The graphics and horrible little animations in this game are the same as they've always been. The fact that all of the moving units are monochromatic just makes the bad animations and lack of detail even worse. Textures in the world just make your units blend in so that they are hard to find at times, which believe it or not, can cause some problems. It seems that with all of the many Army Men games and all of the bad comments about the bad graphics that they would make some kind of attempt to make the game at least slightly pleasant to look at.  Sound I was tempted to take a movie of the game just so I could take a clip of the atrocious sounds that curse this already cursed game. They are bad. Bad, bad, bad. The voice acting especially. There is one point in the game where an allied blue unit that has had his troops destroyed is hiding in the bushes. When you get close enough to him, he spouts out how scared he is and blah blah blah. All it made me want to do was turn the game off. And I didn't need any more encouragement at that point. The basic sound effects in the game are just that, basic. They are boring, without any kind of personality or flair, and most of all annoying. The game still has bad jokes that are delivered with the timing of an accidental pregnancy. If it weren't for needing to hear when vehicles were close by, it would be better to play the game with the sound on mute.  Playability Interface is everything in a real-time strategy game. Especially when you really need to make sure that you don't lose any units as they carry over from mission to mission and you start with whatever you had left when you begin the next level. But did they care to really think the interface out? I don't think so, because if they did, then they all need to find new careers. It's just clumsy. There's no way to get around it. When you are in a pinch and need to select units or groups of different units quickly, it really can't happen. Oh you can designate groups in certain numbers, but if you need to select random units from a couple of different groups, then you'll need to click on the special little black area in the gui and then drag a box around the units that you need. Meanwhile, half of your units have kicked the bucket and you need to load up the save game. Selecting special weapons and items is also a pain in the butt. You have to right click on the item in the gui in order to select it. And unfortunately, if you forget to change back to your regular gun, the computer will just keep using up the limited ammo of the special weapons if an enemy is near.  You can also take control of individual units of the game and use the keyboard to move them around and roll and duck and kneel and all of that. The problem with this is that the screen centers on the unit you are controlling automatically which restricts your view of the field so that you end up running right into the fire of a unit that you can't see because the camera is centered on you unit with it's limited view.  On a positive note, some of the missions are okay. Too bad the mucky gameplay gets in the way of them. The levels aren't designed with any real sense of genius or care. It's just kind of a ~hey a gun would look cool here~ kind of mentality. But there are several different types of missions, which at least keeps some small interest in the game. Not nearly enough to make the game passingly good however.  Multiplayer Yes it has multiplayer, so you and a bunch of your friends can be in pain together. You know, kind of like a bonding experience.  Why, oh why does 3DO insist on wasting everybody's time and money? The army men idea was cute at first, and the engine and graphics weren't the worst thing ever created when the first of the Army Men games came out in 1998, but that was two years ago. Some might argue that the $20 price tag makes up for the lack of new graphics and gameplay, but it doesn't. All I can do is recommend that you save up those pennies and go buy a game that's worthwhile like Starcraft that will keep you interested for a long time.  -- Dan Adams", "date": "Jun 21, 2000"}
