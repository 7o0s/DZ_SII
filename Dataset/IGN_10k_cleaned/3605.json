They have always somehow remembered to keep the ~Fun~ in the game, even when making a more sim-oriented title.  And perhaps here in the U.S., Speedvision can thank Codemasters for the fact that we Yanks actually know what touring car racing actually is.  Codemasters, however, didn't seem to think we would have a clue on this when they rolled out their Playstation One Worldwide TOCA championship title as ~Jarrett & Labonte Racing~, even though the game had nothing to do with those two minor league NASCAR drivers (after the sons, not their famous dads!).  Fortunately, Codemasters was successful enough with Colin McRae Rally and their Touring Car titles that they were able to generate a couple of years of hype towards the new Pro Race Driver, which first shipped a few months back for the Playstation 2 and is now becoming available on the XBox and PC.   In addition to playing the reviewable copy of Pro Race Driver for the PC, I  have also put in many, many hours on the PS2 version, using both the dual shock analog controller and the Logitech Force Feedback wheel (which is a cousin of the more upscale momo Logitech wheel I have on my PC).  Having thus spent that time on the console, I was able to develop both expectations and hopes for the PC version.   For those of you who have not looked at the previews, played the demo or read any number of Codemasters ads, Pro Race Driver is referred to by some as the first ~CaRPG~, where you actually get a cut-scene based story as you work your way through the tiers of world wide touring car leagues.  You play young Ryan McKane, whose father was killed in a racecar wreck some 15 years before present day, while Ryan was just a boy.  He and his older brother followed their father's steps into the professional racing world.  The plot unfolds as young Ryan learns the ropes and in dramatic scenes develops rivalries with the drivers on track, and hopes to learn more about who or what was behind his father's tragic death.  It's not the most imaginative plot in the world, and as someone who has hung around racing paddocks myself, I can't help but roll my eyes at some of the behavior of the story's characters.  But the more important question is whether or not this truly represents an innovation to the racing genre, or is just a gimmick.  I must regretfully say it's basically a gimmick.  I think that those who want to see more cut scenes might stay with the game longer to see the story unfold, but the ~plot~ is not going to keep people playing this game if they get tired of the actual on-track action.     What's more, I found that the cut scenes are basically a thin wrapper around what is essentially the SAME career system that was in ~Jarrett & Labonte Racing~ for the Playstation 2.  You have a central office where you can look at the different items to run free races, get e-mail offers from racing teams around the world, run one-off challenges to win cars, run multiplayer races, change options, do time trials, etc.  Cut scenes are sporadic, being triggered at key points along your career path, but you spent most of your time just joining leagues, racing a season of sprint races against 19 other cars (it was 8 on the Playstation 2, so power PC users be happy they gave you more competition).  The game's storyline quickly becomes an afterthought, almost like a commercial break to interrupt your regularly scheduled racing.  So don't buy this game for the story.   Graphically, the game is a mixed bag.  As is always the case, computer configuration and selection of graphics options is going to determine just how beautiful or ugly the game gets, as well as how fast it runs.  I have a Pentium 1.7 Ghz with a GeForce4 Ti4400.  With that configuration, and comparing it to other PC racing sims I have, I must say that the game ranks below average on the quality:fps ratio.  I always thought the Playstation 2 version's graphics were just okay, but I have to say after comparing the two head to head I actually prefer the PS2 version because at least the frame rate is solid in comparison to the PC.  If you take the time to find a good compromise for your in-car view, you may be disappointed when the replay starts to roll after your race and the beautifully modeled cars spurt and stutter slowly around the course.  Unless you intend to avoid replays entirely (and I think most people DO want to see their exploits!), you should turn down detail until replays are acceptable, even though this means more compromise than you like for the view you get during the race. Of course, if hardware is not an issue for you, your mileage may be significantly better than mine, but I still contend that the cost outweighs the benefit in the case of these graphics.  I must also note that the cars are indeed made of a very large number of polygons, layered for realistic damage and removable parts, and what's more the tracks do generally seem quite faithful to the real world tracks (and there are over 30 of them!).  So if you DO get performance out of the PC version that will satisfy you, you won't be disappointed with the many cool graphical touches that Codemasters added.   There are definitely a few areas of more serious pain with the graphics.  How can it be possible that a mirror was intentionally left out?  They did this on the PS2 version (and in the Jarrett & Labonte game), but you could at least kind of understand it given the desire to keep the frame rate high on a console.  Red arrows are shown sliding around the bottom of the screen, indicating where he is laterally relative to you.  These arrows go from translucent to opaque to represent how close the other car is to you and it gets the job done, but is nowhere near as gratifying as a proper mirror, especially because you don't know which car it is that is chasing you.  Again, Codemasters seem to have ignored that a mirror is an expected feature in a PC sim.  It's almost inconceivable to me that Papyrus can drop you into a 43 car NASCAR field with sweet rear view mirrors, and Codemasters can't find a way to put in a mirror for a 20 car field?  Even TOCA 2 had a mirror!!  This really smacks of a port where very little time and effort was put in to ensure building a ~best of breed~ PC sim, but rather was rushed out as a port of the console version.  It would not surprise me at all to find out that much of the code between the Xbox version and PC version is shared code, optimized more for the console than the PC (and I'll bet the frame rate isn't so horrible during Xbox replays as it is on my PC).  When you consider Codemasters' competition out there, you find that EA has separate development teams doing its console and PC F1 games, and each creates a feature set tailored to the audience on that platform.   Why Codemasters did not invest this effort on the PC side is a mystery.  After playing the PS2 version a great deal, the PC version just felt like a higher resolution, slower version of the same thing, and with more dampened force feedback to boot.  The driving doesn't even feel as 'real' as the PS2 version, as a result.      Regarding the specifics of the graphics, there is a very nice damage model where parts of the car can get crushed, crunched, and knocked off.  They stay on the track and your force feedback device will react when you smack them as you encounter them a lap later (apparently corner workers aren't modeled!).  For those expecting some realism, though, this is where the game lets you down.  You can bang up your car any number of ways and still keep turning in the same lap times.  I have encountered a bit of performance degradation, but its importance to your lap times as compared to, say, your driving technique, is so low as to be a non-factor.    What's more, the AI in the game all but guarantees a fair amount of damage to your car.  You will find that you are hit from behind quite often under braking, and the sound of glass shattering will let you know that indeed your car has taken damage.  The AI cars are less predictable than in many other racing titles, but when it comes to generating lap times, they show similar tendencies.  For example, the first corner at Brands Hatch is an exhilarating dip down hill and to the right.  The AI car brakes too early here, and you can pass them almost every time if you're close.  With all the cars I passed, I can't say as I saw differences in the fundamental behavior of the different drivers. I didn't see that one tended to brake later than others, for instance.  So once you figure out the AI's weakness, you can exploit it in car after car, which takes away from the racing experience, in my opinion.  I will grant that most other console and computer racers suffer from this same flaw, but I had begun to expect them to continue to pioneer the field of AI after Jarrett & Labonte Racing.   On the other hand, the audio, as was the case in the PS2 version, is quite satisfying, sounding very much like the touring cars you might see rubbing paint on the Speed Channel.  Seeing many real-life cars battling it out in Touring Car style is quite nice, and there are even some classic cars thrown in, such as the Dodge Charger and Shelby Cobra.  Your crew chief does talk to you a bit during the race, but he's not all that helpful, reminding you to pit during those races that require it, cheering you on, telling you you're into the points, and occasionally wisecracking when you rear-end someone (~That's ONE way to slow down!~).   While on a console, a certain amount of 'arcadey-ness' is expected to increase sales to general audiences (perhaps unfairly), on a PC you can run off the very audience you are trying to attract.  Codemasters thus produced a physics model that has truly become their signature in vehicle dynamics.  Unfortunately, there is a wide gap between THEIR model of vehicle physics and the real thing.  Take understeer for instance.  The principle is easy.  You go into a corner too fast, you try to turn, the tires obey and turn, but without the grip your car just plows straight on.  That's your understeer.  Codemasters doesn't believe in it.  So any understeer you get is a result of YOU wanting to keep the back end hooked up, because Codemasters DOES believe in oversteer.  On Demand.  Just turn the wheel too much and you get it, as well as when you use excessive throttle too quickly.  The compromise is that oversteer slows you down, so to keep from losing any grip, YOU resist turning the wheel too much, and thus CREATE your own understeer.  There is one exception and that's when you lock up your brakes.  You'll slide when that happens.   The end result of the physics model is a very loose car that somehow lets you make it through corners that you go into with too much speed.   There is a ~SIM~ code that Codemasters gives out for free which makes your car lock up more easily and brake slower.  With the longer braking distances, and slightly less forgiving handling, you get more of a feel of understeer in the physics model, but unfortunately the game's AI doesn't compensate for the SIM code, so it does become very difficult to beat the AI cars when this code is active.  The only way I found to properly enjoy a more sim-oriented experience in the game was to forgo the storyline and go straight into free races where I could specify the number of laps, and the difficulty as a percentage.   Using these options you can to some degree tailor the AI to make the lap times closer to your own, and have more competitive nailbiting races.  Using the SIM code and free races, the game can be made a much more enjoyable experience for people used to other more realistic PC Sims.  The story mode is just a bust on the PC for this crowd, because of the wacky physics in the default arcade mode.   Car setup options are provided.  You can make several changes to your car's suspension, springs, downforce, tire type, and gear ratios, and test drive the track as much as you want before the race.  You'll get a few audio tips from your crew chief when you first enter the setup garage.  You can save a fixed number of setups.  This is a carry-over from the console version.  You don't entire a file name, you just save into a pre-defined block . This will annoy the hell out of experienced PC gamers who don't like to worry about limited ~save slots~.   Multiplayer is available, using an integrated version of Gamespy Arcade.  I didn't have a lot of luck getting a race going at review-time, but this might add more life to the game for drivers who want up to 20 car multiplayer racing over a LAN or the Internet.  I intend to invest more time into this area since I'm not getting much enjoyment out of the single player mode on the PC.   When evaluating this as a PC racing title, it's hard to make a convincing argument for Pro Race Driver.  Its graphics are taxing on most hardware out there, the physics model is an evolution of the previous TOCA series (which some people may be perfectly happy with), and the storyline simply provides a bit of fluff on top of the same career model that Playstation owners has with Jarrett & Labonte racing.   What did you think of Pro Race Driver?   Hardcore simulation addicts will probably avoid this one unless they also have a soft spot for arcade racing somewhere in them.  The people who loved the TOCA series on either a console or a PC will definitely love this title for being a bigger, bolder version of that same series.  There is no shortage of on-track action, wonderful crashes with parts-a-flying, tons of tracks, paint swapping and powersliding.  The high number of real world tracks (36 by my count) keep the game fresh longer, as well.  If you are a PC enthusiast who thinks you might really like a good touring car sim, I suggest you buy this from a place that will let you return if you hate it, or download the demo.  Let's call Pro Race Driver PC what it is.  A no-nonsense port of the console version.  Unfortunately, in this case that's not a good thing.  Considering the less than optimal frame rate, lack of mirrors, arcade-ish physics and rather subdued FF wheel support, I'm thinking that the audience for the PC version won't be very large.  However, those who really loved the TOCA series on the PC might well like this game.  More dedicated racers should try out the free races and the SIM code provided by Codemasters, and perhaps get into some multiplayer action.  On the whole, this game could have and should have been much more than it turned out to be, at least on the PC side.", "date": "Apr 21, 2003"}
