{"name": "Blood Magic", "name_review": "Dawn of Magic UK Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/25/dawn-of-magic-uk-review", "text": "Over the years, we've seen more than our fair share of games like Dawn of Magic - action RPGs packed with incessant mouse-clicking combat, myriad items and enough spells to make Gandalf feel inadequate. However, rather than simply carbon-copying the tried and tested formula made so popular by the Diablo series all those many years ago, Dawn of Magic attempts to incorporate several more modern RPG features into this aging mix.   While the plot can hardly be called original - you're tasked with either aiding or thwarting Modo, an immortal banished to Earth who's hell bent on destroying the world - there are still enough compelling features to warrant your attention. In true RPG tradition you start by choosing your character (from a selection of four) and customising as you see fit.   Youll never be at a loss for new places to explore.  The Awkward Scholar is a bespectacled bookworm with a weak sword arm and spindly frame but a razor sharp intellect and a natural flair for magic. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Baker's Wife (perhaps the strangest character class in RPG gaming history), a robust but intellectually challenged battleaxe perfect for pummelling enemies into putty. The stout Friar is similar in stature and skill to the Baker's Wife, preferring melee weapons to magic, while the Weird Gypsy sits somewhere between the three.   Unlike numerous other RPGs where your early character class decisions restrict your levelling up options for the remainder of your adventure, Dawn of Magic's open-ended magic-based approach enables you to enjoy a far more freeform character upgrading experience than many of its direct rivals. There are a staggering twelve unique Schools of Magic for you to incorporate into your arsenal, with every spell not only contributing towards your character's casting prowess but their physical characteristics, too. Specialise in Fire magic and you'll wield devastating fireballs, while jets of flame will flick out of your hero's body as they run.   Watch your character transform into a lethal killing machine.  Water magic arms you with ice attacks and defences. Opt to specialise in the arcane arts of Blood magic and your character will take on a vampiric appearance and ward off enemies with a collection of attack and strength bolstering spells. You can even go so far as mixing Magic to create an even more unique and powerful type of hero, while your decisions throughout the game will also influence your alignment and allegiances. The choices at your disposal here are almost limitless. Of course no self respecting RPG would be complete without an exhaustive set of character skills and while Dawn of Magic does possess an abundance of these, they're far less imaginative and compelling than the excellent array of spells nestling inside your magic book.   Once you're done customising your character, you're gently introduced to combat and quests with a series of cumbersome and patronising tasks that'll have you carving up wolves and scorpions while searching for specific items. The streamlined, minimalist interface proves easy to use and unobtrusive, while an excellent ever-present mini map that clearly highlights key objectives is also an intelligent addition. Thankfully, it doesn't take too long for some serious, plot-driven tasks and a massive amount of sub quests to come your way, though at times a lack of player guidance can hinder your enjoyment as you're occasionally forced to spend a little too much time working out exactly what you should be doing next.      One of Dawn of Magic's most intriguing aspects is watching your character morph from an unspectacular base model into a finely tuned killing machine, while the fun factor is further bolstered by some excellent (if hardly original) item crafting that sees you imbuing your standard items with a magical kick to improve their potency and value.   On first impressions, the world around you seems vibrant and full of life. Locales teem with NPCs, traders and a wealth of impressively varied and increasingly tough enemies to battle. As you wander around you can exchange pleasantries with peasants and passers-by or trade with salesmen who ply their wares at local towns, while a dynamic day/night cycle adds some visual variety to the fauna and flora-packed locations.   Dawn of Magics visuals are decent, but hardly red hot.  But the illusion of a living world doesn't last long. Once you've scratched the surface of these seemingly lifelike surroundings, you quickly uncover just how hollow and underdeveloped Dawn of Magic's world really is. Citizens reply with the same stock phrases while merchants spew forth the type of hackneyed spiel usually reserved for Sunday markets.   Enemies are something of a mixed bag too. While they're impressively varied, they also tend to be painfully predictable, running after you in ever-greater groups while never bothering to engage each other, whatever their race or species. It's an oversight that breaks Dawn of Magic's already fragile sense of immersion and betrays it for what it really is: a competent and ambitious RPG bogged down by an inability to fulfil its potential due to an over reliance on an outdated template - including an archaic combat system that regularly degenerates into mindless click-fests bereft of originality and excitement, despite the superb and ever-burgeoning collection of incantations at your fingertips.   Combat proves frenetic but a tad repetitive.  There's simply no sense of personality here. Dialogue is stilted throughout, failing to inject any character into NPCs whatsoever and adhering stringently to every fantasy stereotype you can think of. The voice actors struggle vainly with lines of clunky exposition and, despite the odd convincingly delivered sentence, the dialogue is wholly forgettable and, at times, excruciating.Despite its bold proclamations of reinventing the tried and tested Diablo template, Dawn of Magic remains an RPG with more than a whiff of the past hanging around it. The range and flexibility of the spell system and the game's epic scope (both in terms of challenge and the amount of hours of gameplay) add plenty of value to the package and will no doubt satiate those of you longing for a return to the good old days of action RPG mayhem when Diablo still reigned supreme. Meanwhile, the flexible and dynamic character upgrading system does add longevity and a slant of originality. Throw in some solid multiplayer options enabling you to test out your spell combinations against fellow players and you're left with an RPG romp that entertains but never quite manages to reach magical heights.", "date": "Apr 25, 2007"}
