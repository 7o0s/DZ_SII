An obvious re-skin of Mystery Mansion Pinball (released in very early 2006), King Kong Pinball also suffers from a few of the same problems, but not to the extent that kept Mystery Mansion from soaring.   As expected, the table is dressed entirely with King Kong props, from Skull Island's most famous landmark to the heads of it most dangerous inhabitants: Kong and a T-Rex. The Empire State Building makes an appearance, too, lest the table be too island-centric. As the ball bounces off bumpers, rolls up ramps, and drops off into the depths of the jungle, the action is surrounded by pretty much anything a King Kong fan could want.   As the ball bounces around the table, you aim for typical pinball goals, such as spelling out words (like KING KONG) or dropping the ball is a special hole. Bonus, point multipliers, multi-ball challenges... everything you would expect from a pinball game is in here.   A facsimile of an LED display sits at top of the screen not only to keep track of score and ball count, but also to host a number of mini-games. When certain conditions are met on the table, you get to play small games like helping Kong climb the Empire State Building while avoiding incoming bi-planes. Mini-games sometimes extend to the table, too, such as a bi-plane challenge where you must eliminate four or more planes that suddenly start flying around the bottom half of the table.   So, what eventually shoots King Kong off the top of the skyscraper? A problem I had with the original Mystery Mansion Pinball game -- sometimes the ball sorta freezes in midair, and it throws off your timing. Sometimes it freezes as it cascades down the screen. Sometimes it stops at the top of an arc. The freeze is just for a second, so while it's not epic lag, it is a major distraction. At least King Kong Pinball doesn't have the annoying problem of the ball passing through the flipper.  Since they are essentially the same game, King Kong Pinball scores the exact same as Mystery Mansion Pinball. With almost a year's time, though, I expected more from King Kong Pinball -- maybe an extra table? This is not a bad game by any means, it's one of the better mobile pinballers I have played, but it treads water in an era where mobile gamers deserve a little more.", "date": "Dec 28, 2006"}
