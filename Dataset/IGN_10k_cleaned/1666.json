RayStorm is the first fruit to come from Spaz's labor, and if it's any indication of things to come, bring it on!   Originally released in Japanese arcades by Taito, old school creators of Space Invaders, RayStorm is a shooter in the strictest sense of the word. However, it is also a modern shooter, one that takes advantage of all the PlayStation has to offer. This combination, that of classic, solid gameplay with a modern look, is unbeatable.  To begin with, RayStorm is absolutely gorgeous. The game makes use of the PlayStation's hardware beautifully, with semi-transparent water and glowing tracers on the lasers. Taito was able to use quite a bit of texturing (as opposed to Namco's Xevious 3D/G+, which is pretty much all Gouraud shading) but has still maintained a shining, polished look.  The game takes you from the ground out into space, following Xevious 3D/G+'s pace almost level for level. There are air and ground-based attackers, furthering the Xevious comparisons. However, where RayStorm differs is when it comes to the actual enemy design. RayStorm is thoroughly modern, with kickass boss mechs and giant, Yamato-like battle cruisers.  Spaz has done more than just translate the original game, though. You won't be able to beat the game all the way through on easy, unlike the Japanese version. You'll only be able to reach the end on difficult. However, the similarities to Xevious are too many to ignore, and hurt the game in its final rating. It is also a little short. However, with amazing graphics, excellent music, and solid gameplay, RayStorm is one shooter you can't do without.", "date": "Sep 12, 1997"}
