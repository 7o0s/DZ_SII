A big yellow giant with a smiley face walking around an island and picking up the ground while throwing trees around and stomping on villagers.  And at the touch of a button, instant ~hate giant.~  The only real object was to see how big you could get in one day. How can it get any weirder than that?  Try this expansion.  The full Japanese title is Kyojin no Doshin -- Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou.  Now that's a mouthful.  The subtitle is quite odd, with its literal meaning being something like a collection of little people battling to save something/someone.  And yes, that's basically what this 64DD expansion disk (it requires the original Doshin the Giant game to play) is all about.        You slip into the role of one of three 2D characters. After a brief animated sequence (which is quite possibly the most hideously bad piece of art ever displayed on N64), your character goes to bed, falls asleep and dreams that he is being sucked through the bedroom window into the recent past, more specifically the ~Doshin Exposition '96.~ Your objective, as you control a blurry shadow version of your sprite character around the polygonal expo park, is to build 17 pavilions located within the expo. To do this, you need to interact with ~Queen Companions.~ Please don't ask. All you need to know that these ~booth babes~ can be accessed by... and there is no mistaking it for anything else... peeing hearts at signs. Er... yeah. This process is called ~chikko~ (incidentally, ~o-shikko~ is how little kids say ~pee~ in Japanese. Not a coincidence.) You can also ~chikko~ other people you bump into and make friends with them. [Note: Do not try this in real life]. Your friends are called ~Teamers~ (a name given to young people who hang out and are kind of like a gang) and they can join you in a fight against people who have a symbol meaning ~fight~ above their heads.  You can win the fight by ~chikko~-ing them and making them smaller.  If you lose the fight, you wake up in your room and simply try again. Weird? You don't even know the half of it...  The designated location for each pavilion will have a sign showing its shape and contains a picture of one of the various monuments that the islanders erected in your honor in the first Doshin game.  Once you decide on a pavilion to build, you eject the disk and insert the Doshin 1 disk.  You then eject the Doshin 1 disk and put the expansion disk back in.  Switch-a-roo switch-a-roo switch-a-roo... Oh, here we go. If you had the proper monument built in Doshin 1, then construction on your pavilion will start, a Queen Companion will appear and you will be given a new mission to accomplish in Doshin 1. So let's say the mission is ~go to the island and hop around like a rabbit.~ You then go back and play Doshin 1 until you've done it, save, shut down your N64, boot up the add-on disk and talk to the Queen Companion again. For every task you clear, you will be rewarded with a viewing of the hand-animated movie ~More than Giant.~  There is a total of 17 pavilions to be built, so the movie is broken up into 17 different parts. The movie is shown on a 160x120 pixel black and white screen within the game.       There is yet another objective of the title -- to free the imprisoned Doshin.  You can climb his cage and ~chikko~ him which will make him grow a little.  As he gets bigger and bigger... we're sure you get the picture.    Congratulations, you have successfully made it through the introduction to our review, which we put together with the help of our Japanese correspondent Tim Horst. When I first read what Tim wrote about the game, I thought that Tim had gone bonkers from eating too much Furikake and was mistranslating some stuff. Nope. This game is really about chikko-ing people and getting people to dust off the first Kyojin no Doshin game and replay it. Both honorable goals, to be sure - but how good is this game, really? How does it look? How does it play?   Bad. Bad. Bad. The Param team definitely has a sense of humor. Both Doshin games will make you laugh because they're so absurd. But if you've actually shelled out some serious cash to get your hands on the add-on sequel, then it may also make you cry because it's so bad. You play a horrible looking 2D sprite that can only move on a 2D plane (left and right, and sometimes up). As if to prove how badly the sprite is designed, the game will quite frequently zoom in on it until it virtually fills the screen. Yaaaaaaarg! Press the Z Button and you pee hearts. These can be targeted via the analog stick. One button. Gameplay on a 2D plane. Sounds easy, right? But even these simple controls are implemented in a clumsy fashion where they never seem to do what you want them to do. Things get worse once you climb Doshin's giant cage and you realize that pushing down on the analog stick doesn't always mean the game will let you get down... Horrible controls and limited, unappealing gameplay. Good for a laugh, but not much more. Basically, this add-on disk is a glorified movie player. You talk to single-colored, pixelated booth babes to get a task. You then play the original Doshin and come back to get your reward: a single-colored, pixelated movie clip that showcases some of Param's hand-drawn art. The problem is that unless you're a die-hard Doshin fan, the reward just isn't enough. If all you're getting is eye candy, then it shouldn't taste like vinegar. 64MBs of space and this collection of low-res blurry-ass imagery is all we get? Kyojin no Doshin -- Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou is without a doubt the clumsiest and ugliest N64 title so far. I've seen far better games online programmed in Java or Flash -- and they were free! Maybe I'm missing the point, and this game is all about artistic style. Maybe it's supposed to be cheesy. Maybe it's supposed to be a throwback to the early days of gaming. Maybe it's supposed to be modern art. If that's the case then I will happily proclaim that I don't get it. And neither should you. Stay away from this add-on disk, even if you own a 64DD and you're itching for some new software.", "date": "Jul 29, 2000"}
