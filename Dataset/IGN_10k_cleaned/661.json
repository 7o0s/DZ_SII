{"name": "Q*bert", "name_review": "Q*bert", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/27/qbert-4", "text": "Q*bert, while more famously known as the first videogame character to promote incomprehensible cursing, was also the first game I remember to bring in the 3/4 view that confused the world, and had a lot of us crying for more. Or maybe that was just me -- I was in Reno when I spent my first fiver on Q*bert, after the Journey videogame broke down and I had run out the options on the also-incredible Aladdin. Q*bert kept me warm through a lot of dark days -- if by warm, you mean screaming red-faced when, once again, Coily wrapped his body around my head and squeezed me like a grapefruit.  Atari games (AKA Hasbro Interactive) has been steadily releasing remakes of the classics, with varying results. Frogger seemed skewed towards the robot perfectionist in all of us, while Pong was a fantastic example of taking what seemed like a laughing stock of a modern gaming concept and turning it into something unique and addictive. Q*bert, unfortunately, seems like the runt of the litter with concepts that are fun but not engaging, and a look and feel that refuses to make you believe that this is truly the future of our orange friend.  You can play a nicer looking version of the classic game but most of you, I'm sure, are in it for the new adventure. Q*bert now has four worlds to explore, each with a different focus. The first world is a larger version of the classic Q world, with some odd shapes to tackle, and some extra special powers and tricks to utilize, such as the Smart Bomb, which kills on enemies, and the frenetic Speed power up, which will give Q*bert an espresso boost to help him dodge those baddies in record time. The second world introduces environments to Q's life, such as a tribal jungle setting, an arctic world, and a set of city levels that have you figuring out mini-puzzles, such as blocks which change back to their original color when you step on them for a second time. Before you finish your adventures you'll be unlocking your sweetheart from cages, figuring out the function of cannons and hammers in a mechanical set of worlds, and fighting your friends in a two player game. The latter actually ends up being the best part of the new Q*bert, but unfortunately, it's limited by its speed. You can usually finish a two player game in about two to three minutes, and there are only about six sets of levels to choose from. Still, Stephen and I had a great time using special blocks like the Camera (which turns the camera towards the player who first activates the button, blocking the other player's view of the board) and the Trigger (which explodes specially tagged blocks on the player's side of the field). Having to finish your special set of colored blocks before the other player while still sharing the same playing field was the only big innovation in regards to gameplay in Q*bert. Though at first the rest of the game felt like an update to the classic, a few runs over the boards quickly show how little the power-ups and level structure changes really altered the general Q*bert formula. Even Frogger, which played a lot like the original, still managed to eke out some new ideas and concepts, despite the difficulty issues. Even the enemies are nearly identical, from Coily to Ugg and Wrong Way. The new friends you encounter in the various worlds are fun, but do little to inject spice into the game itself -- which is sad, given that they might have offered some new possibilities (such as different abilities for playing as different characters).  Graphically the game seems to have fallen from the crispy heights of the original screens released by Hasbro, which had little Q jumping over blocky landscapes filled with fireworks, bright lights, and shimmering reflections. What we actually get to jump around on are clean but very simple blocks with a higher res version of classic Q*bert and his enemies. The menu system, however, takes a big leap off the shame train with a blotchy in-game scoreboard, and an intricately hidden save game feature that initially leads you to believe that you can't save your game at all. The sound is exactly what you'd expect -- the original voices from the game, which will instantly inject nostalgia straight into your bloodstream. If you can fight off the headspins from that, you'll realize that there's little that's new in terms of music and original sound effects. Not necessarily a tragedy, but it adds to the general feeling that this game was churned out instead of given a little petting and grooming.  I want to say that if you loved Q*bert, you'll love this game, but I'm not even sure that at full price, you'll find this to be a worthwhile hopping experience. You're going to have to like Q*bert -- a LOT -- to beat this game without sighing at the possibilities that might have been, given a more inventive makeover and some wilder tricks. Hasbro isn't one to let any of its franchises sit too long without scratching up some money, so there's a good chance that when Q*bert 2 hits shelves at some point, it might just learn from this game's mistakes.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Jan 27, 2000"}
