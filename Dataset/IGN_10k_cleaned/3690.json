{"name": "Skirt Fighter", "name_review": "Skirt Fighter", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/02/skirt-fighter", "text": "Nobody ever expected this first round of cellphone games to have that much depth to them, which is why titles like Lemonade Tycoon and Splinter Cell are such incredible surprises.  But look hard enough--and you won't have to look that hard--and you'll find there are still plenty of simple, single-minded pleasures to be had on your handset.  And one of those is Unplugged's Skirt Fighter.  Features: Different attacks Full-color graphics Classic side-scrolling fighter  Skirt Fighter is essentially a Double Dragaon/Fihgt Fight-type clone, scaled down for your cellphone.  The streets are awash in blood and tears as a major crime wave seizes the city.  No man can stop this army of thugs and arch-criminals.  So, who do you send in when no man can get the job done?  Why, a woman, of course!  The titular skirt fighter is a lady crime fighter armed with devastating high kicks, high heels that are sure to leave a mark, and a purse that must be full of rocks by the way it levels a foe.  Pure silliness.  But really, do you need an epic storyline for a five-minute diversion?  The only reason to download Skirt Fighter is if you're in the mood for a few fleeting moments of crime fighting as you want for a subway or while away an extremely boring corporate meeting.  And on that level, the Skirt delivers.  Don't go in expecting a deep fighting engine.  Capcom wasn't behind this lady.  Instead, you just use your action keys to fire off acrobatic high kicks, and to perform a combo attack, you just keep pressing the action keys.  No real button combos, no nothing.  Just keep moving ahead and bashing baddies with either your stiletto or purse.  And there are plenty of no-good men for you to tame with your superkicks, as the streets are constantly crawling with the denizens of the criminal underworld.  Visually, Skirt Fighter succeeds, even with its simple graphics, because it reminds you completely of those hastily-ported beat-'em-ups that came across the Pacific by the dozen during the salad years of the SNES and Genesis.  Your short-skirted heroine is something straight out of anime, flashing those big baby blues before making suckas bleed.  But for a city caught in the grip of a crime wave, it's a pretty serene place.  No screams, no explosions, not even a superfly theme song for our sassy lady of the night. If you had any affinity for the Final Fight clones that clogged the 16-bit systems, you might develop a soft spot for Skirt Fighter, as it was cut from the same, well-worn fabric.  The controls are simple and decently responsive, meaning you can get the job done without too much trouble.  Go in with relatively low expectations (not Episode III-low, however) and you'll be satisfied with this simple diversion.", "date": "Jun 2, 2003"}
