The game in-hand features a Yeti out stomping urban and suburban locales, serving up short-order dinners, shredding chickens and surfing the sewage canals...all in the name of love. Different? Absolutely! Clever? Damn right. Fun? For a bit. Urban Yeti is a neat game with some amusing minigames surrounded by a technically advanced main adventure...but the overall presentation is a little loose and sloppy. But it's still enjoyable if you're looking for something not quite the norm. Features Three different locations Four minigames Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  In Urban Yeti!, you play as one of those mighty creatures of legend, out for one important thing: a female companion. So, it's off to find a lady with whom to settle down...but it's not going to be easy. This city's brutal when it comes to the hairy kind...you'll have to avoid the mass public hell-bent on bringing you down, while also following the restrictions of the city itself. Nothing comes free, you know. The developers definitely had fun with the concept and creating an original videogame scenario...and some of the things that our hero has to do isn't exactly normal behavior for a mighty woodland creature out looking for a little nookie. Urban Yeti's overall game structure is similar to the Grand Theft Auto  thing, with players running through a sequence of tasks to advance through the three-location adventure. Early in the game you'll have to find a find a newspaper that'll get you a job to earn money in order to pay the toll to cross the bridge into the next town. The main adventure connects the game's real gems: minigames that are inspired by the classics. If you're a fan of Tron, Tapper, and/or Toobin', you're going to like these original creations from Cave Barn...they're clever and fun.  Like GTA and GTA2, Urban Yeti features a game engine heavily inspired by the game, with the camera hovering at a top-down perspective as it follows the action. The engine is admittedly a choppy one that only gets worse when the screen fills with the cityfolk. This causes problems with the gameplay as well, since players will be bounced around cluttered streets by the inhabitants, and the poor refresh will make it difficult to safely clear out the area. Luckily the minigames don't try to push nearly as many graphical tricks as the overworld does, so you don't get the same problematic gameplay issues.  Even though fault can be put on the choppy framerate, it's the structure that's the game's biggest fault. The designers throw gamers into the situation without an introductory level to teach newbies what to do...players have to poke around figuring everything out for themselves. The blocky artwork and awkward cutscenes don't help to orient the players, either. Urban Yeti! just doesn't feel ~professional~ enough for a professionaly-produced game...ending up feeling like a B-title game released during the Shareware game explosion. Urban Yeti! may have the fun, but because of the loose and sloppy presentation it ends up feeling like a game produced by a few guys down in someone's basement...instead of something out of an established development studio.   It does seem like these guys got a kick out of having fun goofing around with the concept of an Urban Yeti and what he could possibly do, but they didn't really focus on solidifying the experience into something that could be picked up and play by everyone.With that said, I love the concept, and I love the minigames...even though a couple of them (the discus throw specifically) just beg for multiplayer competition. I just think the Cave Barn guys need to work on wrapping up their ideas a little bit more tightly.", "date": "Aug 23, 2002"}
