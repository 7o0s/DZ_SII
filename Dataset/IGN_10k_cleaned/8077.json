In 1999 Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest has its sight set on the baseball fans it left behind last  year.  Angel Studios, creators of last year's Ken Griffey game,  took a new perspective on baseball and outfitted Slugfest with an enhanced engine, cleaned up graphics and introduced a lot more realism.  The Facts:   New pitcher perspective camera. New stadiums  Enhanced player animations and models. Exhibition, Season, World Series and Homerun Derby game modes. Commentary from Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus. Four player suppport. High resolution graphics using Expansion Pak. Medium resolution without. Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound. New catcher and umpire animations. Create-a-player mode. All 30 MLB teams and stadiums.    Gameplay: After being kept under tight wraps (we got it just before it hit stores), Slugfest proved to be an entertaining baseball experience. The game doesn't completely abandon its arcade feel in its efforts to be like the other baseball sims on the N64. The batter interface and controls are unique with an oblong ~sweet spot~ shaped cursor. Pushing or pulling the ball seems to be determined by when you swing and where you set up in the batter's box, as opposed to the 3D ~hit-aiming~ feature found in All-Star Baseball 2000. The timing of hitting was the toughest part to master. In a baseball game this isn't such a bad thing. It's that batting learning curve that'll keep players at the controls until they figure it out, because they know there's got to be some way to get the ball out of the infield!  The pitching control may take some getting used to. The over-the-shoulder look is fine but as you move the crosshairs to position the pitch, it disappears and reappears every half second or so to throw the batters off. The crosshairs blink faster as the pitcher becomes fatigued. The problem with this is, it seems that the cursor blinks off just as you get it to the right location, thereby throwing your concentration off as well. You can change the pitch location, invisibly, after you select your pitch with a combination of the A, B and Z buttons. Also the speed of the pitch is determined by how long you hold down the buttons. However, throwing every pitch and maximum speed will wear your hurler down quickly. One cool arcade-like element is the dramatic motions of the pitches. A curve ball with just the right heat on it will bend and cut with enough bite to make Gaylord Perry proud.   The fielding methods are solid. With the crack of the bat, the directional arrows pop up guiding you to the ball like a neon sign guides a hungry trucker to a nourishing greasy spoon. This is a great element from last  year's game that helps a lot more than just a silly old cursor sitting in the outfield. But, for an added challenge, you can switch this fielding assistance off. We found the cutaway animations on routine fly balls pretty entertaining, but they may prove to be frustrating when you're trying to move through your game quickly, especially if you're playing a season or playoffs. The diving and leaping catches left a little to be desired because of the suddenly choppy frame rate. One time, the Cubs' Lance Johnson went to the warning track and the computer A.I. made him jump early while the ball was still in flight. Of course this threw the timing way off and when we pushed the button to make him jump on time, nothing happened. Granted, only an outstanding play would've saved the homerun, but whether it's a lag in animation or a problem with the fielding assistance, it'll make you want to slap the cartridge out of your N64.  Graphics: Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest has a more realistic look to go along with its more realistic play. The textures look smooth and overall the players just seem crisper. This may be caused by their excessively modular bodies where the torso and arms seem as if they were assembled and not part of one human being. The wrists and hands are set in such a painful position that you hope the motion capture models didn't have to go through such torture. Although they look a notch below the players from ASB '99, make no mistake, the players from Slugfest look much better than their '98 brethren. Slugfest has a brighter overall look to it when compared to the All-Star Baseball games. Even night games are clear and bright and easy to focus on. The shadows all seem to be where they're supposed to be and even though the faces aren't particularly clear, most players are close enough to their real life counterparts even with no face mapping. The umpire animations are great and you may even find yourself watching them to see what they're going to do next.  Sound: Factor 5 sound compression techniques are used to pepper Slugfest with great aural treats throughout the game. The umpire calls are stylized and varied enough so as not to irritate the average player. Dave Niehaus' commentary is likewise varied and entertaining to a point. For some reason, an announcer coming up with new ways to ridicule you when you fail to knock one out during the homerun derby makes is one innovations videogames could've done without. However, with that said, it's done so well that you will find yourself hollering back at your television screen trying to get in the last word. Also, be ready for the sirens that echo past the stadium and fans giving the ~fratboy yell~ (WoooOOOOOO!) every now and then. The sounds of Slugfest are the best of any baseball game released this season. Slugfest is a good baseball game and a definite improvement over last year's Ken Griffey endorsed game. I only wish this game had come out last year so that Angel Studios could've wowed us with some really impressive baseball gaming this time around. Instead, Slugfest is a notch below the standard set by All-Star Baseball 2000 this year but still better than the other 1999 baseball offerings. I loved the sounds and full MLB license. The uniforms and players look great but I would've liked more accurate stadiums. Shea Stadium is missing its homerun siren/hat, Turner Field has no Coke bottle in left field (I can understand licensing problems) and, by Rollie Fingers' moustache, there's no centerfield swimming pool at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix!", "date": "May 8, 1999"}
