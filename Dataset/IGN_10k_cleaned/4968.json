The whole chivalry of the ~knights of the air~ and the relatively primitive technology have captivated me since I was a teenager. And while movies like The Blue Max and Eddie Rickenbacker's Fighting the Flying Circus were entertaining, it was Dynamix's Red Baron that really got me excited about the topic.  WWI flying games are something of a rarity these days so when I heard about Silver Wish's Wings of War I was understandably interested in playing it. Though I tend to like a little more realism in my flight models and mission design, the arcade mechanics keep the action and intensity high. Such concessions to reality as power-ups and rockets will tend to turn off purists (as will the fact that the other aviators will sometimes call you ~newbie~) but, even if you can get past that, the game has some other aggravating issues to throw your way.  The game has some real problem with scale. The first mission of the game takes a full hour to complete, even if you're staying focused on completing your objectives the whole time. Rather than digesting the game in manageable bites, you'll find yourself shooting down fifty planes in the course of a mission and taking out an even greater number of ground vehicles and buildings. Even though the later missions are shorter, they still average about 30 or 40 minutes.  It would be easier to handle if there was some sort of narrative tying the missions together. As it is, the only thing that provides any continuity among the missions is your score. In each mission you'll have a variety of linear objectives piled up one after another: take off, shoot planes, bomb trucks, shoot more planes, take recon pictures, protect bombers, land and steal an enemy plane, shoot some balloons, take out a bridge -- it just keeps adding up but there's never any connection between one objective and the next. The checkpoints within the missions mean you won't have to replay many sequences but you'll still find yourself wishing the overall missions were shorter.  The flight model should be familiar to those of you who've played Crimson Skies on the Xbox or the recent Secret Weapons Over Normandy. Rather than relying on a three-axis control system, Wings of War merely lets you push the joystick in the direction you want the plane to go. You can't get the plane to actually roll over but there are keyboard combos for Immelmans or barrel rolls. Take-offs and landings are very relaxed; you'll find that the planes pretty much lift off the second you give them full throttle.   The PC version of the game allows you to opt for more realistic, so-called ~classic~ controls. These grant you the ability to move in a full 360 degrees across all axes. While it's a little trickier for novice flyers, I found the addition of separate rudder controls gives the planes a lot more flexibility in the air. Even with the ~classic~ controls you'll still find that stalls are non-existent and that ground collisions are incredibly forgiving. Unfortunately in either arcade or classic mode, merely brushing up against an enemy plane results in instant death.  The AI doesn't put up too much of a fight in Wings of War. They're pretty dangerous in large groups if you've got other objectives to worry about but, unless they're intentionally crashing into you in some aerial version of chicken, you can pretty much hold your own.      Sadly, there's not much feedback on when you're hitting enemies or when they're hitting you. There's a small sound of bullets hitting canvas and wood but, what with all the gunfire and ambient sounds, you won't really hear the impacts as clearly as you need to. Little flashes or puffs of smoke would definitely have helped you see when your bullets were connecting.  Fortunately there are no ammo limits for your main guns so you can fire to your little heart's content. Your guns will stop working if they overheat but the heat buildup is so slow and the cool-down so rapid that, for all practical purposes, you can pretty much lay down the fire continuously throughout the battle. You'll have a limited number of rockets and bombs but you'll gain more as you progress through the mission so you'll almost never be without the ordinance you need.  Unfortunately the damage modeling isn't quite up to the standard set by the plane modeling and environmental graphics. When you shoot enemy planes, you'll see wingtips break off and bullet holes appear in the plane body. And while smoke trails are excellent indicators of damage, I'd like to have seen more work done on the textures. When planes finally disintegrate they break apart dynamically but a bit too cleanly, almost as if you've snapped pieces off of a LEGO model.   But despite the casual damage modeling, the graphics are the best part of the game. You can tell from the screenshots that the planes and environments are very convincing. The ground is literally covered with 3D objects, from train cars to trees to artillery guns, and you'll get a real sense of speed when flying low over the ground. Environmental effects like rain and sun flare (not to mention the cool lightning during storms) bring the world alive and help provide a context for the action.   While there are some frustrating shortcomings, Wings of War isn't too bad for the price. Though the World War I setting is fairly superficial, the developers have created an enjoyable arcade game. People who are looking for more than just mindless action will find their enjoyment of this game compromised by the complete lack of any sort of narrative. Gamers who don't mind the lack of story may still find themselves turned off by the overly long missions. Multiplayer might provide some extra enjoyment but there simply aren't enough players online right now to tell.", "date": "Sep 10, 2004"}
