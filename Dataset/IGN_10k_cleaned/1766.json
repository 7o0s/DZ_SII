{"name": "Treasures of the Deep", "name_review": "Treasures of the Deep", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/24/treasures-of-the-deep", "text": "Unlike Tiger Shark, which stressed firepower over all else, and Aquanaut's Holiday, which stressed, well, nothing really, Treasures of the Deep is a perfect blend of exploration and action.  The player takes the role of Jack Runyan, a freelance salvager hired to find various pieces of treasure around the world. Along the way to each destination, Jack can pick up a little extra cash by rescuing sea turtles, dolphins, and lobsters with his net. Of course, it's not all fun and games with the Little Mermaid down there. There are also big, nasty sharks to contend with, as well as meddlesome pirates who want the big booty for themselves (that's pirate-speak for 'treasure').  The game is gorgeous, with beautiful light sourcing that gets darker the deeper you go. The wildlife that populates the water is wonderfully animated, with lifelike fish and mantarays. The sound is great as well.  The game seems to have a languorous pace at first, but this is punctuated by bouts of intense underwater action. Fire your harpoon at pirates or sharks, but be careful about getting shot yourself, as blood attracts sharks.  As well as a harpoon, there are many different underwater weapons available - the best ones are found as power-ups. There's nothing like lobbing a powerful mine at a hapless pirate and watching his cadaver drift away is a cloud of blood...  Control is fittingly sluggish for the small one-man sub you start with. However, you can upgrade to one of eight different, more powerful micro-subs with the money you acquire from completing missions.   Treasures of the Deep is a wonderful and inspiring game that deserves more than a passing glance.", "date": "Sep 24, 1997"}
