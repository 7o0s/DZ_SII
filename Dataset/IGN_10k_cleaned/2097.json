Several of the games it released were tailored specifically for the Japanese market, but the US branch of the company has Americanized one of its bigger brands: JGTO Golf Masters. The Japanese version is a better-than-average, solid game of golf, and the US version, Final Round Golf 2002 is based on the same foundation. This sports title will definitely fill the void for most fans of virtual golf, but it's definitely not the best the system can pull off.  Features: 14 characters Five courses Single system multiplayer Link cable support for four players on other systems Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  Konami utilizes its relationship with ESPN to bring a bit of American flair to a very Japanese-feeling game of golf -- Final Round Golf 2002 plays very similar to previous titles such as Hot Shots Golf and Mario Golf. The aiming of the ball, the timing of the swing, and the overall gameplay interface feels borrowed from these games. This isn't a bad thing at all, since those golf titles were some of the best console links games ever made...and you'll be very familiar with Final Round's control if you've ever played through the other popular golf titles. This game features five fictional courses and fourteen fictional players that you can choose, several which don't unlock until you've successfully played through much of the game. You can even play with friends via the link cable or on the same system. Up to four players can enter stroke play, and in match play it's one-on-one with a single friend. It's a good version of golf if you're willing to put up with some of its loose ends...and there are a bunch.  It's obvious that this game is tailored for the casual gamer, because it's very, very easy to play. It's almost too easy, as the first time through you might find yourself shooting well under par. The fairway play is simplistic as it always picks the proper club and points you right to the pin...and it even calculates the distance of where the ball will end up after successful contact with the ball. Even if you screw up the timing of your swing, the ball will never fly off the club in an exaggerated fashion, only missing its mark a few yards in any direction. Of course, you can completely flub the ball, but that takes an extreme mistime either before or after the swing...and the speed of the powerbar isn't that wild, so you'll never miss the center point by that much. The putting interface is even more abridged and arcadey -- you can slam a ball into a cup 4 feet away at full power, when realistically it should skim right over the rim. Don't expect realistic ball physics here in any form.  It's a mixed bag in the graphics department. The overhead perspective is very clean and detailed, but when the game pops into its pseudo-3D mode, that's when all the flaws come out to play. Every hole has a very gratuitous, and rather unnecessary fly-by of each hole using the system's sprite and background capabilities -- and when in motion, it just looks icky. The movement of the camera is extremely jerky, and the objects like trees and fairway markers jump all over the place (and sometimes disappear entirely). It's odd that something like this is so poorly implemented, since this is Konami...and the company was pretty successful pulling this routine off in its first-generation racer Krazy Racers.  The character sprites are barely detailed in their animations, with only a few frames of movement given for each of their celebratory poses. They've been rendered with very ugly black lines around them that stand out...especially since they're pasted onto the background after a finished hole.  The audio is definitely better, as Final Round Golf 2002 features digitized audio throughout the game, from the thwap of the ball to the clap of the unseen crowd. The music is very generic Japanese BGM, but at least it changes and increases in excitement as the intensity of the golf situation builds.   For a first golf outing on the Game Boy Advance, Konami has put together a good package...but there are flaws and omissions in the design that will stick out like a thumb to folks that really get into their video links titles. If you keep in mind that you're not getting a truly realistic representation of the sport, you'll probably enjoy yourself on the portable courses.", "date": "Aug 31, 2001"}
