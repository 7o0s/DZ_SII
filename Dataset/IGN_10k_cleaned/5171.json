This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the cinematic heroism of WWII can't quite be shoehorned into the gritty disillusionment of Vietnam popularized by films like Platoon, Casualties of War and of course Apocalypse Now.   Men of Valor is a solid game at its core, but it's very, very rough around the edges. Designed as a leafy corridor shooter, these green, foliage-filled hallways are at least wider and less obvious than in most games of this type. The final build, however, has roughly cobbled-together cutscenes, the long load times we saw on the Xbox version, and disturbing trends in its AI. It's more trial-and-error than experiment-and-enjoy. It's certainly intense, but is it all that fun?   A Different Story?  Well, fun means something different to everyone. So, let's dig in. Developer 2015's game clearly takes pains to deliver an honest, authentic and historically accurate look at Vietnam War in videogame form, except for the occasional gameplay loophole that undermines their modus operandi. More than anything, you'll get the feeling that 2015 did its homework trying to re-create the war in a manner that's honest and fair. You'll be on missions where you'll have to save a reporter who then misrepresents the war in his film coverage. You'll see situations in which you or your team have to kill what appear to be simple farmworkers who just happen to be carrying weapons, bombs or grenades. You'll have your senses soundly rocked by sound effects, yelling, cursing, and screaming Vietnamese male and female soldiers, and you'll see squad members die in battle.   Then you notice that you have five hundred rounds of ammunition for a weapon with 10-round clips, meaning you're somehow unencumbered by fifty clips of ammo. Then you switch to your Thompson, and it's another five hundred rounds there. Meanwhile, your squadmates, whom you can't control, never pause to reload their weapons.   Big Mac, Fries, and Coke, and hurry up! A few of the cutscenes do a great job of touching upon the insanity of the war. Some of the intro scenes do a good job of setting up missions, giving you the feeling that there is almost no way you're going to survive. But several things detract from the story. The character animation is clumsy and simplistic, and the dialog is bare-bones and dull, so while setting and music might create a scene, the look and feel of many scenes is ruined by a lack of polish, finesse, and the finer levels of production that the gaming world has become accustomed to. You also have to sit through the same extensive scene each time you replay that section of the game.   The story is different from the norm, too. The lead character is Dean Shepard, an African-American soldier who's upright, compassionate and sensible. You'll get to know him to a certain degree though the set of letters he writes to his parents and his brother in between missions. However, while the letters are an interesting idea, they aren't woven well into the game itself. You'll play through a mission and find little character development of Dean himself. There is talk and chatter among characters, but none that mold Dean's character or that reinforce the letters, which as a result become solitary, dull, and in the end, filler. There are individual story parts here, but there is no real beginning, middle, or end, and what's more, no real direction. Because the cutscenes are so longwinded, it's hard to generate enough interest to read the letters that pop up during some of the many load screens.    Gameplay  As a first-person shooter, Men of Valor is a game you'll feel very comfortable with, since it plays almost exactly like Medal of Honor. I've played all of the MOH games, and I'll tell you, despite my desire to like this, there's precious little emergent flexibility. You'll walk from from point A to point B along a forested hallway and watch as enemies pop out and shoot at you. There are very few shortcuts, if any. There are minimal secondary paths, almost no power-ups, and little need to explore. Granted, there is nothing wrong with an historically accurate FPS, but this simple formula grew rusty a few years back.   Men of Valor tries, but ultimately doesn't waver too much, from the Medal of Honor  recipe (though I prefer it over the lackluster Medal of Honor: Rising Sun). Developer 2015 sets up each mission with long load times, each accompanied by quotes form generals, presidents, and Vietnamese leaders, and often by archival black-and-white footage of the war itself. At some points, it's a little like watching the History Channel -- educational, but sleep-inducing. You'll then find yourself in a huge single-player campaign that supports a very solid range of mission types, many of them changing with scripted objective updates midway through missions. In this way, VU's team does try and widen the format of formulaic shooting. You'll fight in fox holes, creep through tunnels, charge hills and enemy embankments, call in air support, snipe, and find yourself in pretty big, open-field skirmishes.   While the control scheme and combat model for the XBox was  intense, visceral, and chaotic, it's a lot like shooting fish in a barrel once you're armed with a keyboard and mouse. The most you'll have to worry about is the occasional VC or NVA popping out of nowhere while you're reloading your weapon, a problem heightened by the fact that you can't switch weapons in the middle of reloading. When you're not caught in ambushes or fully surrounded in intense open-field battles, you'll sneak through silent jungles fully aware of an impending ambush. But unfortunately, these likeable sensations are never captured and run with to create any real emotion in the story, and the gameplay is never fully explored through diverse enough gameplay. So, instead of feeling thrilled to play another level, you'll feel stressed, perhaps even taxed. Not necessarily the desired result. The single-player campaign is not short; it probably clocks in at 15-17 hours, depending on your skill level. But you'll really start wonder when it will all end.    Bridge over troubled water. Perhaps the biggest problem, besides been-there-done-that level design and the lack of exploration is the AI on both sides. Your teammates take an amazing amount of abuse, though it's not because they're tough. It's because they throw themselves at the enemy, rarely killing them, and more often then not, they turn their back on the assault. They often run in front of you while you're shooting, and they may very well take the best tree to hide behind while pushing forward. On the other side, the enemy AI is just short of clueless. You'll watch an enemy walk in front of you, maybe two to three feet, looking for its place to set up. It won't shoot while running. Sometimes, it takes three, maybe five seconds for them to react to your presence, and then they'll start shooting. Other times, they don't react at all to you or your team AI. You'll often see your AI and the enemy AI standing pretty close to one another and not firing on each other at all. Or missing for 100 shots at a time. Your own team AI doesn't die, either. I suppose if they AI was perfect, I'd never live to finish a single mission, but this AI is spotty, inconsistent, and troublesome.   The Unreal engine is used to create fully detailed environments with an enormous amount of polygons, cover points and obstacles. The good part of this is that the grass is so thick in parts, you can literally crawl through it unseen. Better than any Vietnam game yet, the jungles in Men of Valor are genuinely dense and designed for great ambushes, hiding, creeping, and sniping. The downside is that the game just doesn't flow all that well or move at a very consistent framerate. The game chunks out a lot, and accompanying the sluggish framerate is a frustrating, less-than-smooth control scheme. Neither aiming in general nor pinpointing enemies with precision is a smooth affair. And one jungle passage pretty much looks like the rest after a while.   There is a good assortment of 1960s weapons, though. You'll use a basic knife, SKS with bayonet, M1911, M14, M16, M60, AK-47, PPSH41, M79 grenade launcher, and hand grenades, to name a few. You'll have the chance to use set turrets on ground and mounted machine guns in moving helicopters. You'll also get to do a river run with the M79.     Multiplayer  The multiplayer modes are hefty, though all of the mechanical, control, and AI issues carry over into these modes of play. You can engage in a Multiplayer Mission (specific battles based on historical events), Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Recover the Documents (like capture the flag), and Search and Destroy.    Overall, the amount of variety and the interestingly designed levels, including enormously detailed, dense and heavily forested levels, provide a perfect battleground for serious online matches. I played several games online to get a feel for the game, and though the control mechanics are not to die for, crouching and even lying down in totally blanketed areas does create an interesting and fun dynamic. At one point during online play, my opponent and I crawled toward each other on our stomaches and only when we were three feet away from one another did we see the other and shoot. The System Link option is inviting, and the cooperative campaign is solid and entertaining too. Even though the technical aspects of men of Valor aren't that impressive, the sheer amount of game possibilities and some very good online maps make up for it.    Graphics  While the levels are well covered in every imaginable shade of green--and they're extremely well decorated and designed, in terms of sheer density--the poor game character animations, motion capture work, and the overall framerate detract from its general beauty. The texture work is solid stuff, though, and even the water realistically flows in relaxing wave patterns. There is little pop-in, too. The characters themselves display a robust amount of polygons and the weapons look realistic, load accurately, and recoil with accuracy and a good feel. It's just too bad the animations are so repetitive and near comical and that most of them sound underpowered.   1960s protoype laser for the Deathstar. Still, the special effects are solid. You'll get big explosions, gunfire, smoke and fire, and moving characters on screen simultaneously. And for the most part, all of these effects individually look good.    Sound  Developer 2015 has brought the audio chaos of Vietnam to this game. You'll hear your squad members and the VC and NVA shout curses back and forth at each other in the midst of battle, and it's good to hear the genuine, salty language you'd expect. Unfortunately, the sound appears excessively downsampled, creating audio artifacts and fuzziness--which is odd, because this final build is on four CDs, plenty room to accomodate high fidelity sound effects and music. If the poor AI, jerky animation, poorly edited cutscenes and bottomless ammo didn't take the game dangerously into budget territory, poor sound has it teetering over the edge of the gulf, with only the Unreal engine and the occasionally visceral firefight holding it back.Although Vietnam is apparently the New Hotness for first-person shooters, the Medal of Honor approach doesn't fit with such a controversial war, and the frankly simplistic combat becomes old pretty fast, a matter not helped by feeling hemmed in along a linear path, where one village tends to look like any other, as do the rivers, gulleys, and hilltops. The long load times also break pacing, and you have to skip through two slow-loading screens to get back to your last save point if you die somewhere along the way. MoV on the Xbox had great sound and a well-integrated control scheme that allowed the whole experience to fall together nicely, but it's all just a jumble for this PC port.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
