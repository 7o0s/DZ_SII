The game captured everything that originally made the first two titles great (first-rate animation, one of, if not the deepest fighting systems, and simple three-button controls) and put a new coat of paint on it; officially upgrading the series for the 21st century. Not long after, Sega released Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution in Japanese arcades, and again for Japanese PS2s. Finally, after some worries that the game would not make it to our shores at all, Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution is here. But is it really that different than the already released VF4? Is the game really worth buying for two additional characters? Was Virtua Figher 4 ever that great to begin with? The answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes.   Gameplay  A literal ~evolution~ of Virtua Fighter 4, Evo is, at its core, the same game as its predecessor. Though there are some significant additions to the title, with the most blatant being the two new characters, Goh and Brad. Both characters physically resemble each other in a strange, hard-to-explain way, while simultaneously looking completely different. It's an oxymoron if I ever saw one, but maybe after looking at them you'll get an idea of what we mean. Maybe it's their ~edgy~ looks, or the fact that they don't really look like they belong in the Virtua Fighter universe. Regardless, the two fighters' styles are drastically different, and that's what really counts.   Goh Hinogami, an orphan raised to be assassin by a group mysteriously named ~The Organization,~ uses a Judo fighting style; making him a more effective combatant in close encounters due to the emphasis on throws and grappling moves. Because of this, Goh is also a character that is less accessible and should only be used by more experienced players. Try playing him from the get-go and you may find yourself frustrated by his seemingly lacking arsenal of combos and moves. But further prodding and practice will reveal how powerful a character he really is (with a number of linking throws that can cause some heavy damage in just a few short moves). Goh, who brings a unique fighting style to the game, is a great and refreshing addition to the cast of players in Virtua Fighter 4 Evo. His closest counterpart is Wolf, and even that is stretching it a bit. The series has always needed some more close combat characters, and with Goh, we get exactly that.     Brad Burns, too, is an effective close proximity fighter. A professional kick boxer who's seeks the thrill of a fight, Brad, obviously, fights using Muay Thai. He may appear to be similar to Vanessa's Vale Tudo style, and to an extent that comparison is valid, but like any good fighting game, there are several different nuances that make both fighters completely different. Learning the ins and outs of each character is half the fun in VF4 Evo, and after spending some quality time with Brad, it's clear that he is also another great addition. The Virtua Fighter series has been pretty consistent in quality when adding new characters (we'll leave Taka Arashi out of this conversation) and this game only continues that tradition.   As mentioned already, the core fighting system is almost untouched. Some of the characters have a few new moves and the timing also feels a slightly different. All in all, VF4 Evo is the same fighting core experience as the previous title, and that's definitely a good thing. The fighting system is, and always has been, incredibly deep and sophisticated; this is no button-masher. A skilled player can knock out an opponent in under ten seconds, although an equally-skilled person would avoid such embarrassment through the use of counters, evades, and a solid offense.    One of the most important, and difficult things to learn in the VF4 Evo is the timing of your button and directional presses. There are a lot of folks who try to give it a chance in the early going only to walk away hotheaded because of its stiff and stilted feel. But it's quite the contrary after mastering the controls. In fact, Evolutionis more about flow than any other fighter out there. Simply put, it's a difficult game to master, but that's what ultimately makes it that much more rewarding. After all, there's a reason the Virtua Fighter series has cult-like followings across the world, and it has nothing to do with top-heavy women who ~kick high~ or absurdly sized weapons.   So back to this whole ~Evolution~ thing; missing from this version is the Kumite mode that had you rising in ranks and earning (sometimes) gaudy accessories for your fighter to wear. Though to say it's completely removed from the game would be misleading. In its place is a new Quest function that turns out to be an unquestionably better experience. The premise finds your character heading to different arcades around Japan where you can earn enough wins to enter tournaments. You can also try and satisfy certain conditions in a fight while trying to complete specific quest requirements. For example, one of the possible challenges may ask the player to win a fight by using only kicks. There are a ton of different objectives, and many of them are much easier read than done. There are also fights that you must face where you must plow through numerous enemies using only one energy bar, and other similar challenges. It's tough stuff.   While playing through the Quest mode, certain battles will have a prize at stake. This is often a clothing item or accessory that can be outfitted on your character. Earrings, necklaces, clothes, hats, helmets, hair dye (it fades over time!), color contacts, and shoes are all things that can eventually be earned in the game. Sometimes, though, rather than an item, you'll receive money. These funds can then be used in the shop to purchase more items like the ones mentioned, or a number of other cool prizes such as wallpapers, VF1 character models and videos of Japanese players performing difficult game moves with one hand. Strange? Sure. Cool? For any Virtua Fighter fan, absolutely.   It's also easier to advance and earn items in Quest than in Kumite (where it was difficult for casual players to progress), and the diverse number of challenges makes it all the more interesting and the monetary aspect gives Evo an almost RPG-like feel.. With an uncountable number of fights and challenges and over 1500 different items to collect, Quest is the ultimate single-player experience. Even Soul Calibur's Weapon Master mode pales in comparison.     Of course, matches would be no fun if the AI was anything but killer. Luckily for us, killer might be a bit too accurate. Virtua Fighter 4 Evo's AI is based on the techniques and strategies of the best Virtua Fighter players in Japan. Having witnessed such talent firsthand, all I can say is that if you don't spend some good honest time with the game, you'll get nowhere fast. What's great about the CPU, besides just being smart and acting in a truly realistic fashion, is that the difficulty ramps up perfectly as you work your way from 10th Kyu to 1st Dan and upwards. Again, there's no other fighting game that can boast such quality AI. Unfortunately, one of the coolest examples of the previous game's AI in action (a mode that let you ~train~ an AI character) is noticeably missing. A small complaint, and for those of us who have Virtua Fighter 4 anyway, it's a moot point. On a more positive note, the standard Arcade and Versus modes are included, as is the insanely awesome Training mode.    With two new characters, improved AI, and Quest, AM2 couldn't have possibly crammed anything else into this budget-priced title - or could they? The could. In fact, Suzuki and company have included what is perhaps the greatest extra in the history of fighting games: Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary. This US-exclusive game can be found in the Options/Special menu and is basically Virtua Fighter 4 Evo only with VF1-style flat-shaded character models. All of the original tunes and stages also make appearance, as do the first game's rules; jumping will cause the player to float through the air, and there is no moving in 3D. 10th Anniversary is an homage to the old school (the game even has the classic Sega chant and logo in the beginning) and we love it (For a more detailed report, read our special feature here). Just know that this truly special bonus is reason enough for any VF fan to own Virtua Fighter 4 Evo independently of the other changes.   So yeah, in case you haven't gotten the point, VF4 Evo is outstanding; though it's not entirely perfect. Outside of omitting the fighter-trainer mode, it seems that you can't save your decked-out, cheesy-looking fighter to a memory card for play at a friend's house either. With the amount of customization allowed, there would be nothing greater than to be able to transport them around for competitive bragging rights. Not implementing this feature  is illogical and disappointing. Still, in the greater scope of things, it's a small price to pay for everything that you do get.   Graphics  Virtua Fighter 4 was always been gorgeous but there's one glaring flaw that's kept it from perfection: horrid aliasing issues. Now, we're sure that by now we're used to the ~jaggies~ in PS2 games, but Virtua Fighter 4 appeared to be the worst case scenario; character's arms and legs looked as if they could saw an opponent's limb off with just the slightest touch, and the finer details in the faces and appendages looked awful. There was just no way around it -- until now. The dreaded aliasing problems that plagued the previous title are now virtually gone. Not simply reduced, but almost entirely removed from the game; and boy, what a difference it makes. It's as if we're seeing Virtua Fighter 4 the way it was meant to be. And yes, it's stunning.   What stands out the most in VF4 Evo though, are the character models. While not necessarily the most realistic fighters you'll ever see, each character is constructed carefully and delicately, while the stylistic angle finds a steady balance of realism and exaggeration. Oh, and who can forget the kookiness, too. From diamond-studded chokers to Skid Row-inspired nose-to-ear rings, you'll never mistake VF 4 Evo for something else.  The end result is a unique-looking fighter that's still very accessible.     Even from a pure technology standpoint, VF 4 Evo doesn't fail to flatter. Aside from the cleared up aliasing issue, the game holds a rock steady 60 fps that only complements the rest of the game's beauty. And this is with two large, detailed fighters onscreen, deforming environments (snow and sand), slick water effects, and sharp lighting that set the mood better than Barry White on your first honeymoon.   Another visually striking element is the animation. Since the very first Virtua Fighter, character animation has played a large role in the series, and VF4 Evo is no different. Each fighter's style is based on real-world fighting techniques, and the attention paid to accurately (re)creating each and every move is remarkable. The best example of this is the drunken master, Shun. His style is a riot, and a pleasure to watch, bringing to mind the best of Jackie Chan in the first Drunken Master movie. Simply put, there is no other 3D fighting game out there that hold a candle to VF 4 Evo's silky animations. It's just that good.    Sound  Let's remember one thing: Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution is a fighting game. The genre has never been known for moving scores, intense surround effects, or quality voice acting. In fact, quite the opposite is true; the majority of fighters, 2D or 3D, typically feature Eastern guitar rock, stereo sound at best, and voice acting that is easily bested by the likes of Resident Evil. And that's saying something.   As expected, Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution dares not break any of the standard fighting game music rules, and features a soundtrack of guitar rock that could easily be found in any other fighting game. Prepare for lots of wailing, and lots of wanking. As for the voice acting, well, things don't fare much better. It's hard to say if the quality of the acting or the actual script is worse; maybe it's a combination of the two. Either way, there are only so many times you can hear Lion say, ~It's a matter of course - I'm gonna win!~ before you start to question your own sanity. But then again, the music, Engrish, and cheesy voice acting are things that appeal to a lot of gamers. Honestly, it's not that bad. In fact, for a while, it's almost funny. But after the first few hours of play, I quickly switched to sound FX only. To each his own.   Where the sound does excel is with the sound effects. Not so much in the environments -- the ambient sounds are kept to a minimum on almost every level -- but in the impact sounds. Every punch, kick and throw sounds just as painful as it looks. Better yet, depending on the character, a corresponding ~weight~ seems to affect the sound. So, for example, Pai's hits sound quick and snappy -- fitting for a fighter of her build and speed -- while Wolf's attacks are thick and deep. Good stuff.     Do you like fighting games? Let me rephrase that: Do you like games? If so, then you owe it to yourself to check out Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution. Why? Well, the game has an incredibly deep and long-lasting single player mode, and the versus mode never gets stale; there's the included 10th Anniversary mode that's almost a separate game in itself; the graphics have been improved upon and almost perfected, and so has the gameplay. This game is the epitome of contemporary fighting games, and at the budget price of only $20, it's virtually priceless. That VF4 Evo even made it stateside is miraculous, but to have it debut as a Greatest Hits title is literally unbelievable. The biggest complaint I could make about the game (besides the inability to import/export custom players) is that the box art is branded with that ugly red Greatest Hits stripe.   Buy Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution today. And while you're at it, pick up the original (also at a budget price of $20) to have the ultimate Virtua Fighter 4 collection. It's just a matter of course - you're gonna love it!", "date": "Aug 8, 2003"}
