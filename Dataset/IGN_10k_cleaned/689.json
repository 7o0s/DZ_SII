Realizing its popularity, Vatical Entertainment secured the rights to a Game Boy Color version and soon came up with an incredibly dull and disastrous title for everyone's favorite portable system. Features: Digitized Voice Multiple Weapons Realistic Hunting Accessories Four locations Only for Game Boy Color    It's an absolute given fact that a game must have solid gameplay for it to be considered ~good~ in the least of terms. Deer Hunter has none of it. It's an insanely boring and redundant simulation that leaves you begging for death, especially if you have to review it. To put it bluntly, Deer Hunter hits it off on the wrong foot and never follows-up.  Basically you take the role of a common hunter roaming various locals such as the Alpine Meadows of Colorado or the barren woodlands of an Indiana Winter. In your search, you look for clues such as deer scrapes or droppings to locate a suitable hunting position. Armed with one of three weapons, you try and shoot down a trophy buck to mount on your living room wall. Once you accomplish this, the game is over and you get to do it again.  The weapon selection is meager, shotgun, rifle, or bow, each easy to master and use, offering no difference in style. On top of that, you get a few tools to make nabbing that healthy deer easier; an attractant scent to lure in the big bucks; a cover scent to mask your bodily odor, and a tree stand to obstruct the deer's view of your bright orange vest. While hunting, you'll use all these accessories along with the deer call and antler rattle to draw in the unsuspecting animal and cap it with a shotgun shell.   And that's it, folks. That's the game. Each hunt takes less than a minute and offers no reward or incentive to play any further. The game supports a trophy room where you can view previous kills and maybe compare them with friends, but once you turn the system off, all your records are erased. The audio doesn't help the game at all, sporting annoyingly repetitious birdcalls and dialogue. Visually, the game has hardly much to offer. With only four locals, you'd expect them to pack in a bit more detail into the environments but of course, they don't, and we end up with another graphically handicapped game. The visuals are so bad, you can't tell if the deer are coming or going.    To be honest, I'm surprised the Deer Hunter series sold as many copies as it has on the PC. But it's really one of those niche games that slip in the market and just totally explodes itself into smash hit. Too bad I can't say the same for the portable version. You can honestly finish exploring and playing this game fully in less than three minutes. You'd have to be a diehard fan of the PC series to even remotely enjoy this romp in the woods. Trust me, there're a million and one things better that you can buy with thirty dollars.", "date": "Feb 5, 2000"}
