Banjo Pilot was among the first batch of Game Boy Advance products announced for the system, and was even in playable form as far back as E3 2001 when it was revealed as Diddy Kong Pilot, a Nintendo-branded racing title. More than three years and a namechange later Rare has finally completed its racer, and remarkably, this title wraps up the company's initial group of GBA titles first announced nearly a half-decade ago. The final product that is Banjo Pilot isn't going to set the world ablaze with any real innovation; it's a pretty safe design, borrowing most of its racing elements from other successful kart racers on the market. But what it does, it does pretty well, and matches with the quality of gaming expected out of Rare's handheld group.  When Nintendo put Mario & Co. in race cars and slapped them in a Mode 7 environment on the Super NES, a genre was born, and any game bearing any similarity to this Nintendo concept will always be compared to the original Nintendo concept. Banjo Pilot, despite offering skyward airplanes as vehicles, just can't avoid this legacy, and it's pretty clear that Rare, with its Banjo-Kazooie characters in the drivers' seats, didn't even try to keep its own game from the inevitable comparison. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since the actual game design is a really good balance of kart-racing game ideas done right, and pushes a great learning curve balance with some good elements that keep the action going even when every cup is completed with a ~gold~ status.  The game definitely follows the formula expected of kart racers on the Game Boy Advance. Large list of available and unlockable characters to choose from? Check. Race tracks over a variety of terrain? Check. Offensive and defensive weaponry to collect? Check. Battle mode via link cable? Check. Time trial modes for any and all of the available race courses? Check.  But Banjo Pilot certainly takes a new turn by sending the vehicles airborne, and it's this hook that twists the racing design a bit to make Banjo Pilot a slight change from the kart-racing norm. This skyway element isn't as extreme as it sounds, since these planes behave suspiciously like ground-based vehicles; if you deviate from the set raceway path your craft will slow down as if tires hit the dirt, or even cause the plane to tumble if it's particularly hazardous terrain underneath. But the game designers did throw in a few elements that make air racing work better than kart racing, such as mid-air power-up collecting.  There's also much more ~defensive~ capabilities thanks to the craft's ability to barrel-roll and loop, and in fact players are rewarded with a special, handy boost if they manage to avoid an incoming projectile at just the right moment. The handling of the planes is pulled off surprisingly well and feels pretty natural on the GBA d-pad, though the control just screams for an analog stick. Banjo Pilot sticks with the familiar Mode 7 engine used in pretty much every kart racing game ever developed on the GBA. Rare's tech is really well balanced, though, allowing for the graphic designers to pretty-up the environments with colorful coursework as well as sprite objects to line the track. All eight racers can bunch up on the screen without a hitch in the action, and the developers really push a sense of speed in the environments...especially in the much more difficult challenge cups. But there is a bit of a pop-up issue with weapon pick-ups, making it hard to see these icons until you're pretty much right on top of them. And, biggest issue of all: the vehicle literally blinds the view of the track on straight-aways because it hovers right in front of the player's line-of-sight; an option to turn the player's vehicle transparent a la Super Punch-Out would have fixed this issue...though it may have affected the game's performance.  And even though the game really does feel like yet-another-racing-game on the Game Boy Advance, at least the formula's changed up slightly so the developers can throw in some surprises. At the end of every cup, there's a boss ~dogfight~ against one of the nine characters in a forced-scrolling design. It's a cool element until you find the one pattern that works for nearly every boss in the game. And then there's the Jiggy Challenge, a neat variation of the normal racing game where players have to collect six jigsaw pieces and win the race to mark that challenge as completed.  Banjo Pilot definitely had quite a ride from concept to creation, from its branding change to an extreme switch in technology and back again. The final product definitely plays it safe, but at least Banjo Pilot offers a lot of challenge in its design. Mario Kart: Super Circuit remains king of the GBA character racing genre, but Rare's game can sit a comfortable second place in the handheld line-up.", "date": "Jan 21, 2005"}
