And how I still have a copy of the game languishing somewhere in my spare bedroom -- presumably near my neglected copies of Wooden Ships and Iron Men and Advanced Squad Leader. But rather than bore you with the details of my initial fascination with the tabletop version of the game, let me just say this: I dug it and I dig the idea of bringing those games to the PC.   Apparently the folks at Taldren feel the same way. In partnership with Interplay, they've built a series of PC games around the tabletop version. With the recent shift in publishing, from Interplay to Activision, the developer is now free (or is it compelled?) to set the game in the Next Generation universe.   Taking place just before the upcoming movie, Star Trek: Nemesis, Starfleet Command III begins in an unlikely state of a newly forged peace between the Federation and the Klingons. But while the Federation is eager to bury the hatchet with their bumpy-headed brethren, a lingering sense of animosity and distrust make things a bit more complicated. The Romulans, fearing what this new cooperation might signal, have their own unique role to play in the conflict. Add in a brand new menace called The Borg and you're talking about some serious fun.   I like the fact that the number of races has been scaled back. While purists will no doubt lament the loss of all the secondary races that were included with the previous games, just having a four-sided conflict makes things much clearer. There are four campaigns for each of the races and an additional three conquest campaigns for the non-Borg types. The conquest campaigns are more akin to the game's Dynaverse component allowing players a bit more latitude in terms of missions and encounters.   While the action of the battles is undeniably solid, the campaigns themselves are a bit dry. Attentive players will be rewarded with a reasonably engaging plot and storyline, but the bulk of us will find ample enjoyment in the action of the missions themselves. At times the story unfolds right alongside the action however, giving us the best of both worlds.   Depending on which campaign you're playing you may have the option of taking additional optional missions. There are a number of fairly pointless scanning missions (including one revealingly titled ~Look under every rock~) that I suppose are intended to serve as a nice break between the big fights. It's not too much of a chore to search for missions you're interested in but since you can only see the missions available in your current sector you may find yourself running from sector to sector looking for one that you want to play.   But optional missions are important nonetheless primarily because they offer you a chance to gain a few extra prestige points in between the story-driven battles. These prestige points are the currency used to purchase new ships, new ship systems and more crew. While it's a real treat saving up enough prestige to get the really powerful ships (like the Warbird or Borg Cube for instance), the time you spend developing your crew is perhaps even more important.   The game brings back some of the RPG-like elements that were missing the last time around. Recruiting and improving your ship's six main officers is the determining factor in nearly every aspect of ship performance. In order to execute high-energy turns, you'll need an experienced helmsman for instance. And since these officers can die in the course of a mission, you could find yourself at a serious disadvantage if you lose them. Suddenly finding your sensor range cut in half because your science officer bit it can turn the tide in an instant.   To paraphrase Napoleon, ~Amatuers discuss tactics, professionals discuss power managements.~ That's the real issue at hand with the tactical combat, clearly the strongest feature of the game. While a player who understands the basic principles of maneuvering into favorable firing positions can be good at this game, what separates him from the great player is energy management. Judiciously diverting power to your shields and weapon systems according to circumstances is the key to success in this game.   But despite the depth of the combat engine, the team has wisely scaled back a few features from previous games. Electronic warfare isn't nearly as big a priority this time around and to balance out the loss, the power of missiles seems to have been scaled back a bit. Fewer shield facings (the two on each side of the ship are now reduced to one) make setting up promising firing positions a bit easier.   The option of warping within a battle grants a few more options for getting around, but the unforgiving map boundaries can make this a risky proposition. Rather than alerting a player that his ship has gone out of bounds, leaving the mission area instantly results in a forfeit. It's not much of a problem since a great deal of the action takes place well away from the edges but on the wider ranging battles, you can accidentally screw yourself out of victory if you're not careful.   The battles themselves alternate between moments of tedium and exhilaration. For the most part, the engagements take place at far too short a range for my tastes. With ships capable of hurtling across the vast distances of space, you find yourself strangely scraping the sides of several ships at once while jockeying for position. The game exhibits an inconsistent collision model in this respect with odd moments of a few ships occupying the same space.    The AI won't make things easy on you either. While I still have a bit of a problem with the near-constant crowding of the ships, the enemy here is a wily one. When they're not stacked right on top of you, you'll find them cleverly maneuvering to bring their weapons to bear on the slightest weakness in your shields. They protect their own weaknesses quite well too and seem to have a solid grasp of the power management required to turn good captains into even better admirals.   While many of the other aspects of the game are good, the tactical battles are what make it really great. Management of your ship, careful selection of targets and shrewd maneuvering are all crucial factors in your success, and the range of options to choose from in each area ensure that victory will be a product of your own skill rather than some arbitrary whim of the developers.   I still won't let go of the frustration of the missing Z-axis. Regardless of the team's rationalizations, its absence takes some of the fun out of the setting and creates tactical situations more in line with a naval wargame than Star Trek. Nevertheless the game's tactical depth is immense and only the most jaded fans will criticize the two-dimensional approach. A slightly larger pool will find the pace of the game to be a bit slow (even on the highest setting) but, given the intricacies of managing a space-faring battleship, you'll often find yourself glad of a few minutes respite.   It would be more of an issue if the interface were smoother. Each iteration of Starfleet Command makes some headway in this area and this third version is probably the best yet. Given the amount of management required of you, the developers are to be commended for a comprehensive and convenient set of hot keys but there's a fairly high bar to clear here in terms of usability.    Beyond the normal scripted campaigns, Starfleet Command III offers a slightly improved version of the Dynaverse engine from the recent Orion Pirates. The campaign board still looks like a slightly updated version of the board game (complete with hexes and chits) which is a big disappointment. I don't mind the game's tabletop roots at all, but I object to the dry presentation offered here. The various missions offered up in the Dynaverse range from outrageously exciting to just plain dull. An online version is available through Gamespy but far too few people are playing it currently for it to live up to its full MMO-ish potential.   Single player and multiplayer skirmish options are also included for times when you only have 15 or 20 minutes to spare. The range of choices is fairly comprehensive letting you set up starbase assaults or straight deathmatches. More interesting are the progressive Battlefest missions. Each player gets three lives. Each time you die you'll respawn in an even more powerful ship. It's a nice way to trick you into thinking you're fighting in larger battles against more opponents.   The graphics are quite a bit better this time around. Higher-resolution ship models and improved textures really bring the series to life. It may seem strange to be checking out the ship models in the midst of battle, but the detailed designs are worth checking out even at the risk of neglecting your more pressing duties. Explosions and weapon effects are really convincing as is the new damage modeling. The improved damage textures let you tell at a glance (provided it's a close one) just how messed up your enemies are. Once they get really damaged, they'll even start trailing that purple anti-freeze. While there's not much to speak of in the way of animations, the fact that the ships bank in to turns adds a lot of personality to what might otherwise be a pretty staid game.   While Patrick Stewart provides the bulk of the voice acting talent in the game, the rest of the voices are much better than in previous versions. This is really put to good use during the battle sequences. Hearing your various officers call out enemy actions and alert you to the status of your own ship really brings the missions to life. What's more, they serve as helpful cues to increase your situational awareness. Given the amount of stuff to keep track of, this is a welcome feature. The only weak spot in the voice acting are the Borg readings. It's by design, to be sure, but the flat robotic voices don't sell the action as well as those of the other races. When the sound effects start kicking in, explosions and phaser fire tend to make things slightly more confusing for the Borg player.   What did you think of Starfleet Command III?   The comm system has been streamlined and automated to a large extent. Each mission event is announced by your crew in a text window and through spoken dialogue. Your own response options are highlighted below. Simply click on the corresponding dialogue to move things forward. Scanning of targets is also automatic, leaving players to focus on the purely tactical aspects of the game.   And that's the way it ought to be.It's too bad that this game comes out in the same year as the superlative Bridge Commander. While both games offer unique experiences, the overall effect of Starfleet Command is much less engaging than that of Bridge Commander. Still, the former is cut from the RTS mode while the latter plays a bit more like a sim/adventure game.But while I prefer Bridge Commander's approach, that's totally a personal thing. If you're more in the mood for an RTS-like game, then this is definitely the way to go. While it's a bit more detached, it allows the player to focus on commanding the ship personally rather than delegating responsibilities to officers.The Next Generation setting is entirely faithful to the Star Trek canon and that's bound to attract a wider audience than previous editions. The slightly reduced focus of the conflicts helps to keep the player oriented in the right direction from a story standpoint, which is also a plus. It's the only title around that really offers this kind of experience so, if it sounds the least bit enjoyable to you, you'll find the gameplay more than lives up to the concept.", "date": "Nov 22, 2002"}
