Now it's trying to move its grittier, urban-style ~Street~ designs to the handheld. EA's real soccer is great. This truncated, trick-based game of football? Not so good. If the development matched the console perhaps it would have scored a point higher, but even that might be a stretch due to the overall lack of intensity and excitement of the game design. It's clear that, on top of the more-miss-than-hit gameplay, the Nintendo DS version didn't receive nearly the same amount of time to cook properly - the game's riddled with quirky bugs and odd AI behavior. There's some OK fun here, but the technology is far more impressive than the gameplay - and I'm more looking forward to this engine being used in something else than playing its current iteration.   FIFA Street is based upon the current console version of the series, which is, apparently, intended as an apology for the original 2005 version of FIFA Street. I'm taking the console guys word for it, since I never played the first game in the series - but if they're right, DS owners are lucky that EA waited a season before bringing the game over to the handheld. Like the console versions, FIFA Street 2 for the Nintendo DS breaks the sport of soccer down to its most simplistic, shrinking the arena down and reducing the roster down to only three players plus the goalkeeper. The focus isn't just in getting the ball through the opposition's gate, but in the style that it took to get it in there. By using the ~trickstick~, you can perform moves that can both deke out your opponent as well as give you style points to build up a Gamebreaker meter, something that, once full, can make scoring a goal almost a sure thing. Almost.   The developers, the same team that worked on the Madden and FIFA series on the Nintendo DS, worked pretty closely with the console team to come up with the touch screen version. Even with some visual shortcuts, the Nintendo DS version looks great - tons of detail in the environments and great character animation all running at a smooth 30 frames per second rate on the handheld. The development team pushed a good amount of effort in giving the single player a meaty experience. And, at the very least, the cartridge is jammed full of licensed music, even if the track selection is a little too random and a bit repetitive  -- it at least continues the promise of DS owners getting a bit more in the way of extraneous fluff in the console-to-handheld translations.   But perhaps they worked a little too closely the console design. The ~trickstick~ idea is clearly not a particularly good idea on a system that doesn't have a second analog stick. On the console, players simply flick the second analog stick up, down, left, right or in the diagonal positions while pressing a button at the same time. On the DS, this trickstick is assigned to the touch screen, requiring players to drag their thumb up, down, left, right, or diagonally while hitting the shoulder buttons. Now, if the Nintendo DS screen was super sensitive to fingertip touching and sliding this might have been a good idea. But in practice, it's not - it will take several games and much practice to manipulate the virtual stick with the thumb, because many times it just won't register the movement due to the touch screen's limited touch-sensitivity. After playing with the system for more than a year and a half it's clear to me (and most of the DS audience)  that the touch mechanism is made for precision touch with a stylus and the plastic strap used for Super Mario 64 DS and Metroid Prime Hunters. But it's not meant to recognize a greasy thumbpad sliding around its surface.   To be fair, after a few matches you sort of get the feel for the touch screen mechanism and how much you have to brush the fingerpad against it to trigger the virtual analog stick. Even with practice it's never a hundred percent, though, and not a good replacement for the real thing. The developer could have, and probably should have just devised a better control mechanism specific to the Nintendo DS to make the control flow better than it does.   Tighter control can't fix some of the unnecessary bugs and glitches that remain in the final product, though. The Nintendo DS version of FIFA Street 2 was clearly shipped before it was finished. Watch in awe as the opposition scores on its goal when it tries to pull off a trickstick move facing in the opposite direction! Marvel at some locking animations that will trap the ball against a player's foot, getting him stuck in a clunky walk cycle that will continue for a random period of time! Thrill when the ball gets stuck against the wall, keeping it out of play until the clock runs out! And choke when the aforementioned bug happens during sudden death overtime when the only thing that'll fix this bug is powering down the system.   These bugs are not all that frequent, but they do happen enough to realize that the game didn't get the final bug testing polish. Some bugs seem to be in there just to make the gameplay easier on players - trip a computer opponent, for example, and he'll get up and stand still for a full second, plenty of time for the player to snag the ball unchallenged. Other glitches just seem like oversights. Most notably, if your player has control of the ball, hitting the A button will shoot it, but without the ball that button is a ~shove.~ Problem is, if you lose control of the ball and try to kick it, your character will stop what he's doing to go into the ~shove~ animation, which causes the ball to get further away. Frustrating.   Bugs and quirks aside, the game as a whole isn't all that exciting. Score a goal and it never feels like an event. It just happens with barely any special fanfare. Kick one of the ultra-awesome Gamebreakers and your player simply kicks it into the goal with a goofy ~video skip~ motion that repeats the kick animation three times before being nailed into the goal. And apart from the recorded music tracks playing during the action, there was almost no attention paid to the audio presentation. Turn off the music and you'll expect to hear crickets chirping. It's that quiet. It's almost as if the plug was pulled before the team could put in one more layer of excitement in the production, and clearly shows that Exient didn't get the same development schedule as the console studio.  I really wanted to like FIFA Street 2. Really. Even though screenshots don't seem like it does, the DS version looks great -- at the very least I appreciate the effort that went into the visual engine driving the product. Control could have definitely used some work, but with a little practice the touch screen analog stick mechanism can be playable. But the game falls apart with unnecessary gameplay quirks and bugs, things that just can't be ignored, an element  that absolutely should have been ironed out before the game shipped. And when you add that the design isn't all that exciting to begin with, all of this makes FIFA Street 2 a significant letdown.", "date": "Mar 7, 2006"}
