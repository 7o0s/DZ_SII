You don't need to spend $5.99 this badly.   In 1995, Jumping Flash, a platformer that puts players behind the controls of a robot named Robbit, was released in the United States and quickly won PlayStation fans over with triple-jumps, power-ups and 3D gameplay - remember, this was in the days before Mario 64.   I'm here to tell those fans, you can't go home again.   I missed out on the initial release of Robbit's quest to collect jet packs that would propel him to other areas and keep him moving toward a face off with Baron Aloha - a guy that is stealing chunks of land and terrorizing the planet - so I don't have the sentimental feelings for Robbit that many share.    That said, I can sit here and tell you in all honesty, that this game stinks. The characters are jagged, using the D-pad to look around is sluggish and you never have a sense of the dimensions of your robot.    Enemies? You can ignore them. You'll take more damage holding the right shoulder button and trying to aim with the D-pad than you would if you just hopped away. The only thing you're going to get from the enemies is power-ups, and if you're not fighting the enemies, you don't need power-ups.   Bosses? There's a dragon at the end of world one. You can literally sit there, shoot it and beat it. You don't have to worry about running from its flame-breath. Just sit.   Jet pods? These little guys are at the heart of your mission. Aloha unplugged the pods that propel each world, and you need to gather the pods to reclaim the world. Of course, there's absolutely no challenge to the hunt. The yellow words ~JET POD~ appear on the screen where the devices are located. You hop over to them, take four seconds to figure out how you're going to jump up to the pod, grab it and move on.   Repeat for 18 levels.    As far as gameplay modes, there's either the story track or time trials for you to run through while shooting poorly animated frogs and using Roman candles.Its important to point out that I didnt come into this game with high expectations. I knew I was about to play PlayStation port and should be ready for dated graphics, but this is just a game featuring weak gameplay, graphics, story and sound. Although I don't think Jumping Flash! has a place on my PSP, I'm not knocking it's history -- I'm just saying it didn't stand the test of time.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
