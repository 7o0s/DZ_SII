The 2D platformer will remind gamers who have been around the block a few times of everything from Castlevania to Ghosts 'n Goblins to Mega Man to Contra.  While fans of these games will likely want to give Blast a look, it is too rooted in the past to be an outstanding, modern effort.  It boasts a lot of humor and personality, but the gameplay isn't doing anything new.   It's rare that a game makes me laugh out loud, but I was doing so during the intro to Barnyard Blast.  The premise is great: when Robert Belmart's little piglet is caught tee-peeing an ancient castle, the swine has to cowboy-up and rescue his son.  The story pokes fun at videogame clichs and references old-school games like Bad Dudes and Sunset Riders.  I really have to give the development team credit (made up of just 12 people) for injecting so much character into this little DS cartridge.  Its charm makes the otherwise humdrum affair quite playable.     The graphics are adequate but don't approach the beauty of the DS Castlevania games.  Robert and his enemies could use a few more frames of animation.  When killed, bad guys simply disappear from the screen.  While it's pretty original to play as a shotgun-toting pig, the monsters you encounter are dull.   Gameplay-wise, this could be straight outta the 8- and 16-bit 'hood.  It has nostalgic appeal, but some of the mechanics really need to stay dead.  Like regenerating enemies, for instance.  And unforgiving, frustrating jumps.  The title ~Barnyard Blast~ sounds like casual shovelware, but this is a totally hardcore game.  Luckily, I do find it to be one of those games that you can put down for a while, then come back to it and almost immediately get past the part that was giving you trouble.   The real bummer is that the game doesn't offer anything new.  Without any clever, inventive gameplay mechanics, you've got a very generic, run-of-the-mill platformer with a hilarious story.  Unfortunately, it's gameplay, not humor, that matters most.   The music is also a blast from the past.  While it will remind you of late night sessions with your SEGA Genesis, the tunes are common and forgettable.  The sound effects, though, from your shotgun blast to the enemies' death moans, are nice.   Rather than collect weapons along the way, Barnyard Blast hands out your arsenal right from the get-go.  Having to decide which weapon suits which situation, and managing your ammo at the same time, adds a nice bit of strategy to the game.  There isn't a convenient way to cycle through your weapons and items, though.  You can tap a selection with the stylus, but this is the only function the tool serves in the game and you probably don't want to hold onto it just for that.  The L and R buttons cycle through the items and weapons, respectively, but it has to be done on the fly while enemies are swarming you.  I would rather have a menu screen I could pause to and make my selection.Barnyard Blast has a lot going for it, but unfortunately not the most important things.  Hopefully the developers can take their great sense of humor and old-school roots and move this genre into new territory, rather than get stuck in the past.  Retro gamers might want to stop by the barnyard, but there are already several, better classic-flavored platformers on the DS.  If gaming in the past isn't your thing, you'll want to pass on the pork.", "date": "Mar 18, 2008"}
