AND 1 is not entirely unlike Electronic Arts' NBA Street franchise, with personable players storming the courts with over-the-top moves and barely legal (by NBA rules) antics. It's a solid alternative to the current round of basketball games, such as EA's NBA Live mobile game, that seek to create a more sim-esque experience. In fact, I'd even say that this style of ballin' is better suited for mobile gaming than a five-on-five simulator.   AND 1's story mode charts the course of some ballers as they dominate the streetball scene. With names like Helicopter and Main Event, the stage is already set for some personality. AND 1 delivers in that department, foisting some nicely drawn character portraits on the player, as well as some detailed fantasy courts. The rise of these ballers is charted by a portly announcer that calls out super moves and slamming wins. The level of detail, from the animations to the overall spirit of the proceedings in the entire game is infectious and goes a long way to keeping you interested, even if some touchy controls might occasionally frustrate.   Gameloft has mapped the controls to both the d-pad and the number pad -- a choice that makes sense from the outside, but during actual gameplay, can prove tricky. With passing and shooting mapped to the bottom of the number pad (5, 0, and # are used), your hands sometimes get in the way of each other since the game is solid action. Couple that with the need to hold down keys versus tapping them to initiate different moves and I found a few instances in the first hour of play where I wanted to turn the game off. I stuck with it, though, and it did indeed get better.   AND 1 does feature some of the kind of manic moves that make streetball more fun to watch than the pre-April NBA season. One of my favorite moves isn't the flashiest, but it's the most effective. When you are on defense, approach the player with the ball and hold down 5. This launches your player into a determined run that often results in a steal by intimidating the dribbler. The computer will use it on you sometimes, though, so don't think this is your ace in the hole to turn a game around if the going gets bad.   AND 1 offers an easy Instant Run mode where casual players can jump into a quick game for short sessions. Games last only a few minutes and never reach atmospheric scores, which keeps things interesting with winning a game by only a couple points in matches where a basket is worth only a single point. AND 1 comes with a few options for tweaking the game play, such as adjusting basket values and fouls.  AND 1 is yet another quality production from Gameloft. From the opening track, licensed from Sean Paul, to the character designs, AND 1 is loaded with personality. I did have some issues with the control as it is tricky to learn at the beginning, even with the provided tutorial that lets you try out moves before leaping into actual play. (Seriously, though. Who really uses a tutorial?) However, I did have a solid amount of fun with the game and I suspect that a lot of basketball fans will too.", "date": "Mar 16, 2006"}
