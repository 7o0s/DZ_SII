The results have been solid so far -- Chu Chu Rocket, Virtual On, and Sega Rally 2 have been playable over the 'net, and enjoyable as hell (though the latter two are limited to Japanese audiences only).  Now, developer KID has entered the fray with Treasure Strike, an action game that's playable both on- and off-line. The game kicks off with RPG-style character building, where you select your character's sex, build, and overall appearance. From there, you're introduced to Buffalo, a burly miner with a Viking helmet, who exposes you to the exciting and sexy world of treasure-hunting.  From the main town menu, you can hit the bar for interesting conversations with busty barmaids, stock up on extra weapons at the shop, or change your personal appearance at the Coco Brothers' salon (home to the most blatantly gay duo in the history of gaming). Once you head to the treasure hunter's guild, you'll be matched up with one to three opponents in the Treasure Strike arena.  In the arena itself, you're treated to gameplay that's best described as Power Stone meets Syphon Filter. There are a number of treasure chests scattered around the arena, which require keys to open. You can pick the keys off the ground, or pummel your opponents via melee or range attacks to steal theirs. Holding down the R trigger centers the slightly flaky camera behind your character's head, and tosses a targeting reticule over the closest opponent in range. Once you get the appropriately-colored keys, you can squeeze the L trigger to bump open a chest. Items such as health, and machine parts are hidden inside  and one of them contains the Target Treasure. If you get your hands on this, the screen turns red, the words Treasure Strike! appear, and it's time to run like hell to the exit  everyone else will be gunning for you. Reach the goal with the Target Treasure, and Congratulations! You win!  I must admit that the underlying concept and scenario designs are quite good.  Unfortunately, the game is spoiled by control issues that should have been addressed from the very beginning. For starters, you can't attack when moving  hitting the melee button brings your character to a dead stop. Ditto with the range attacks.  This problem does a good job of completely gumming up the game's combat portions, which play a huge part in the game itself. Hitting an opponent is more of a matter of dumb luck than actual skill, and irritates me to no avail.  The overall balance of the game is a bit out of whack, too. I was able to win my first few matches by patiently waiting for my opponent to get the Target Treasure, then clonking him on the head and stealing the damn thing. It's a cheesy technique  but hey, it works. Once you get further into the game and snag new weapons, this becomes even more effective.  Graphical content is so-so; while the game's art design features nicely drawn characters and fantasy-ish machinery, the in-game polygonal warriors and arenas just don't cut the mustard. The game outputs in high-resolution, but there's no VGA box support  completely inexplicable.  The single-player game's a bit of a wash-out  but as we all know, a game's lameness is inversely proportional to the number of people who can play at once. You can have up to four-player Treasure Strike treasure-hunts via a four-way split-screen, which ain't bad at all  the frame rate doesn't slow down, and it's more fun to match wits with your buddies than the mediocre AI. You can connect to KID's servers in Tokyo to play on-line, complete with a decent player-matching interface  and the game's extensive player customizability ensures that most of the folks you'll compete against will look quite different. Still, none of this fixes the game's cruddy control . . ..   On the plus side, Treasure Strike utilizes TCP/IP for Online play. This is a good thing  the online components of both Sega Rally 2 and Virtual On require the Dreamcast to call special phone lines owned by Japan's KDD corporation, while Treasure Strike lets you dial into your local ISP and connect to the game servers through the Internet. While the amount of lag is greater than in dedicated KDD-line games, it ensures cross-compatibility for a potential US release (and that importers won't have to call Tokyo whenever they want to play a game). I'd appreciate it if more Japanese companies wrote their network code in TCP/IP  the second you require custom KDD lines, it completely breaks compatibility with the North American market.  While Treasure Strike does feature some valid gameplay concepts, I honestly can't see a US publisher picking it up without revamping the gameplay and graphics. At the very least, this is another game to add to the growing number of online-enabled titles in Japan  let's hope that more developers follow suit. -- Colin ~Waku-waku dekitai yo~ Williamson, IGN", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
