It is a concept and a series so classic, and so almost universally superb in all of its available incarnations, that it holds an almost unique place in the sort of collective gamer consciousness.  Final Fantasy?  Diluted.  Mega Man?  Consigned to the past.  Mario, Zelda?  Perhaps a bit too mass-market.  Castlevania?  Yeaaaaaaaaahhhh...  Providing, of course, you ignore the Nintendo 64 games, which any right-thinking human should.  Moving along now.  Castlevania Chronicles is a revised and updated version of a straightforward Castlevania platformer from the X68000 home-computer platform in Japan.  While the PlayStation version doesn't get much of a graphical update, it does have an entirely new suite of arranged music (you can pick between the original and arranged soundtracks at the start of the quest), and anyway, why on earth should one quibble over details in this instance?  It's Castlevania.  Yeaaaaaaaaahhhh...  Gameplay  It's Castlevania.  Do I need to explain this to you?  Well, given that you're probably under the age of 18, and ignored our many commands to play the perfect and holy creation that is Symphony of the Night (or, alternatively, you're under 18 and that unorthodox specimen is your only exposure to the series), a brief primer.  Your last name is Belmont.  That means your mission in life is to go into the forbidden castle of Dracula, armed only with a whip, and kill everything you see there -- zombies, bats, skeletons, jungle cats, floating eyeballs, mutant fish-men, Death, all that jazz.  Simple, yes?  Structurally, Chronicles is more or less the same as the original NES Castlevania -- i.e., the levels and bosses are familiar and arranged in about the same order.  The straightforward gameplay isn't much different, either (although you can down-whip while jumping now).  You still can't jump off the stairs, but with luck this game won't be popular enough to cause a similar spike in the teenage suicide rate.  To gauge this against the Castlevania series as a whole, it's a strong game, but one inevitably eclipsed by the later installments in the series.  Simon's Quest some have mixed feelings about, but Dracula's Curse, Super Castlevania IV, and the appallingly fine Rondo of Blood on the PC-Engine are finer examples of the Castlevania concept, but they had the advantage of experience and greater technical resources behind them.  It's still great fun to revisit the original, particularly considering how much better it looks.  Graphics  I'm not up on the precise capabilities of the X68000, but judging from the look of Chronicles it was a 16-bit machine -- this looks about like what you would get on the PC-Engine or an early-to-mid-lifespan Genesis game.  It certainly beats hell out of the NES version, with bigger sprites, better animation, a couple of layers of parallax scroll, and a lot of little visual accents that couldn't have been done on an 8-bit machine.  The candles flicker nicely, the fiery explosions are better than you'd expect, and many of the monsters feature fine animation for the game's capabilities (I particularly like the gradually-collapsing mud statues from level 3).  This isn't a visual ground-breaker by any stretch of the imagination, but as with so many qualities, it's Castlevania, and it's particularly satisfying to get an upgrade of the original adventure.  Sound  The remixed sounds are still very MIDI, but then why should they be anything but?  Most of the tracks have the slow-moving electronic sound that has always characterized the platformer Castlevanias -- it's a very different feel from Symphony of the Night's more recent addition of heavy orchestral influences (well, strictly speaking, that probably happened in Rondo of Blood, but considering maybe three of you ever played that, it's not as good an example).  With what was once easily recognizable as ~game music~ almost entirely disappearing in favor of the broad range of sound possibilities CD music allows, it's nice to hear some tunes that take you back.C'mon.  Explain to me how I'm supposed to say a word against this game.  It's freakin' Castlevania.As such, fans of the series have probably long since bought this and played it to death, so I would like to speak here to those of you who know not of the Castlevanias of old.  If you can't be bothered to do the truly right thing, purchase a stack of orphaned systems and play the four or five Castlevanias every self-respecting gamer ought to have enjoyed, grab Chronicles at its bargain price and find out what you were missing while you were still belting your kindergarten classmates upside the head.  Hopefully my optimism holds true, and a good game is indeed eternal.", "date": "Oct 24, 2001"}
