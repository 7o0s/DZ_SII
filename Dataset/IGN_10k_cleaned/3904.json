In the post-SimCity 90s, it seemed every manner of virtual world was popping up in a computer.  SimFarm, SimAnt, SimTower, and then the plethora of tycoon titles, covering everything from roller coasters to restaurants.  We don't think there was ever a SimYogurt or SimDMV, but then, not everyone can be so overwhelmingly brilliant.   Not that I want to cut down the entire genre -- several titles that began way back then have survived and are doing just fine, in whatever current incarnation.  And then there's a certain little franchise from Maxis which has sprouted up like some mythic Titan to stomp around and leave most every other sim game quivering with bladder meter envy.  Love them or loathe them, simulation games have made their mark in the PC gaming landscape, and it's a rather gigantic footprint.   Sick Puppies' Ghost Master is one of the new-generation simulation titles which, along with projects such as Peter Molyneux's The Movies, seek to offer something new to a fairly played-out genre.  And while Ghost Master's premise -- manage a team of haunters within several floors of a house to scare the poopy out of hapless humans -- seems innovative, we can't forget predecessors such as Molyneux's own Dungeon Keeper, one of the first sim titles to turn the genre on its head just a bit.   Regardless, the basic idea of Ghost Master is compelling.  You become a master of haunts, recruiting a team of spirits, goblins, sprites and other nocturnal nasties to do your bidding.  And your bidding, of course, is to disturb, shock, confuse, and outright terrify pesky groups of mortals who think they have some claim in the earthly realm.  All these supernatural hijinx use up precious plasm, however, which is only replenished from the terror you're able to produce.  So it's a careful balance between spectacular spooking and available resources.   Ghost Master consists of a series of haunting scenarios.  In most of them, your goal is simply to scare all the human inhabitants to the point where they flee in terror.  A few, however, require you to accomplish more complex goals, such as making sure all the decaying corpses in a particular house are discovered by its residents.  Working against you, however, is your limited supply of ectoplasm, as well as occasional savvy mortals who are capable of eliminating your haunters one by one.   In each scenario, you work with a team of haunters selected from all of those currently available.  Each haunter has different powers, skill levels, and ~fetters~ (the type of location in the mortal realm to which they can be bound, and thus active).  A gremlin, for instance, might focus on electrical powers (such as causing sparks to fly here and there, or disrupting appliances), and require electrical fetters (a lamp, a vacuum cleaner).  Each scenario has its own set of fetters and challenges, so a ~Recommended~ option is available when choosing your team to ensure that you'll get haunters that can get the job done.      Once you've assembled your ghostly team, you're ready to start causing mayhem.  Each level is filled with a variety of fetters, which are used to bind your haunters.  Haunting consists of binding a haunter to a particular fetter, then telling it what powers to use.  It will then go about its otherworldly business, affecting any mortals unlucky enough to wander by.  Powers use up plasm, however, and the more impressive the power, the more expensive it is to use.  If a haunter is becoming too much of a drain on your resources, you can either tell it to use lower-level powers, or remove it from play until it is useful later.  Since you only have one instance of each haunter, it's important to think carefully about just who to play, and where.    Your haunters are only part of your concerns, however.  You also have those pesky mortals running around, and each of them has his own characteristics.  On the right-hand side of the screen you have access to details on each mortal, as well as a quick read on their status.  Each mortal has three important traits, displayed as meters accessible from their portraits: Terror, Belief, and Madness.  These reflect, respectively, their fear, their resistance to haunting, and their mental stability.  Also, many mortals have particular fears and habits which make them especially susceptible to certain powers.  You affect a mortal's traits by how well you haunt, as well as how effectively you play on their particular fears and quirks.   Along the way, you'll find trapped haunters which can only be released through some particular method; a witch tethered to a vacuum cleaner, for instance, might be shaken free if everything in the room were to rustle about.  Once freed, these haunters become part of your arsenal.  Occasionally you'll have to free certain haunters in order to accomplish further objectives, adding some variety to the game.  Also, you can give your haunters some extra training in the Ghoul Room, where you can add new powers for a price.   Ghost Master leaves you to your haunting by offering an intuitive, unobtrusive interface.  Camera zoom, rotation, and scrolling commands are easily accomplished with either the mouse or keyboard.  Haunter and mortal properties are accessible either by clicking their portrait on the left or right side of the screen, or by clicking the actual target in the level.  Your total available plasm is represented by a dark green bar at the top of the display, while the percentage of this plasm currently in use is shown as a bright green overlay.  It's easy to keep track of which mortals have fled by seeing whether their portraits are checked off, and during important moments in a scenario the view switches to a cinematic camera, so you don't miss anything crucial.   All very well.  But how does it actually play?  There is definitely an initial satisfaction to hearing tiny simulated people scream in terror after you unleash a swarm of huge spiders, or attach a spirit to a hapless child.  Unfortunately, the novelty wears off quickly, especially since it isn't too difficult to scare mortals, so long as you keep the powers coming.  While I suppose it's true that certain mortals are more affected by certain powers than others, it's just as easy to treat them all the same.  This also means that the difference between haunters is only relevant when you need to use a particular fetter, or if you need a particular power to cause a certain action.  Otherwise, it's just a matter of laying it on thick and waiting for the mortals to inevitably scream and flee.  The game just doesn't offer much reason not to take this approach.      There are, however, the scenarios which require certain tasks be accomplished, rather than simply ridding the house of human inhabitants.  This might have been intriguing, but most of the goals are either too obscure, or the steps to their solution too unreliable, making these levels a frustrating exercise in patience and stamina.  With the game alternating between being far too easy and far too hard, it's difficult to find a balance (or happy medium -- har har) where haunting is actually fun.    While Ghost Master doesn't feature cutting-edge graphics, its visuals are perfectly effective.  Using a cartoony, Sims-like style, most of the visual tastiness comes from detailed character animations and the special effects unleashed by ghostly powers, some of which are quite impressive.  Zooming the camera around the house with multiple powers in effect and mortals running here and there doesn't cause a hitch in framerate, which is consistently smooth throughout.   Ghost Master features surprisingly impressive sound.  Listen closely and you'll hear your mortals babbling gibberish to each other, or turning on a radio, playing pinball, or playing their own favorite tunes on a piano.  These sounds are effectively localized, too, so you'll know just where that next satisfying scream is coming from.  The music is also good -- much better than I'd expect -- and manages not to become grating even when the game play does.  The only aural weakness are the voiceovers, which are hammy and sometimes even histrionic (just wait until the tutorial voice in the beginning starts screaming at you with impatience -- it's annoying, not funny).   It really is too bad that the actual game play is so underwhelming, because despite its problems in execution, so many aspects of the game are so well done.  The game exudes buoyant personality, from the snappy humor of the opening cinematic to the genuinely funny pleas you'll hear from trapped haunters.  There's also a wonderful attention to detail, obvious when you stop worrying about haunting and simply watch how the mortals go about their business.  They're surprisingly lifelike: they make themselves dinner, sit and play the piano, light a fire if a room gets cold, and even fight over the bathroom.  Their reactions to your ghostly doings are sufficiently affected and amusing, and you'll notice them wobbling about with tentative steps when they finally realize they're trapped in a haunted house.      Sure, we've had this kind of voyeuristic satisfaction before with The Sims.  But The Sims didn't give you a chance to terrify and torture your little polygonal friends.  The best thing about Ghost Master might be an element of satisfaction that the designers didn't necessarily intend: given the similarity between its mortals and the inhabitants of The Sims, those with a long-festering resentment of Maxis's uber-popular franchise will have a great time wreaking chaos on these overly cute simulations.  Trying to use the toilet, little girl?  Let's see how you like it when a swarm of spiders bursts violently from the walls!  And so on.In the end, Ghost Master is not supposed to be a glorified fish tank, however amusingly morbid; it promises satisfying game play and real strategic challenge.  Unfortunately, these are promises it simply can't keep.  Despite its strong personality and impressive presentation, Ghost Master isn't so formidible with the lights turned on.", "date": "Sep 12, 2003"}
