It's taken nearly 400,000 years for homosapiens to get from banging flints together to where we are now  and it may take another 400,000 years for Pro Evolution Soccer on the DS to become a decent football game at its current rate of development.   Last year's Pro Evolution Soccer 6 was a little late to the DS football party  Electronic Arts had already fielded three bona-fide FIFA titles on the console, and by the time it got to FIFA 2008 it had a very respectable football game on its hands. PES 6 was the first entry in Konami's series to hit the handheld, and it clearly wasn't yet match fit. So, one year on and some months behind its housebound brethren, what has Pro Evolution 2008 got to offer?   Naturally, PES on the DS is a quite different affair to the versions currently wooing players on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Though the established control system is present and correct - replete with trademark subtleties such as the triple-tapped low driven cross and the chipped through ball  both the visuals and the physics that bring the games together have arisen from the primordial PES soup.    Avoid the wall, little man, avoid it!  Indeed, graphically the game pales even in comparison to the series' first ever outing on the PSOne and struggles even to live up to the now pre-historic International Superstar Soccer outings on the N64. Player models are leaden and nondescript, and a strange sense of scale is present, giving them the proportions of sprightly two-year-olds gallivanting around a gargantuan pitch. Of course the DS is not blessed with the most powerful of processors, but games like Viewtiful Joe: Scratch and New Super Mario Bros. have proven that with a little flair it is possible to extract some aesthetic class out of the machine.    Likewise, the gameplay harks back to darker days of football simulations. The characteristic flow of PES games is all but absent, with a rigidity to the passage of play and a staccato rhythm to matches. With the players lost amidst the vast proportions of the pitch, it is a more viable option to sprint towards the goal, though a fixed and overly intimate camera angle means that more often than not an opposing player will suddenly appear from outside the area of vision and steal the ball. This pushes players towards using the radar  present on the bottom screen  more readily than in other more mature PES games.     In place of the Master League is the World Tour, one of the few original aspects of the DS version. Taking an original team of no-marks, the player is tasked with beating every team on the International roster. Prior to matches there are occasional mini-games, although they rarely provide anything more challenging than 'avoid the wall'. Coins are earnt for victories, which can be spent either on acquiring new talents for existing players or can be placed in the Gacha-get, a slot machine where defeated players reside waiting to be won. It's a pleasant feature, and while it definitely lacks the intricacies of wheeling and dealing in the Master League it does prove intriguing and makes for an engaging single-player experience.     There is an impressive roster of international teams that form the backbone of the World Tour  and in a charming touch you'll also learn the language and population of each nation, as well as how to say 'hello' in their native tongue  though the club team selection is more than a little threadbare. Being limited to only the licensed teams, fans of the Premier League will have to make do with playing mid-table scuff-fests, with only Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United available. Compared to FIFA's comprehensive team sheet it's more than a little lacklustre.   Do I not like that.  To the game's credit there is a wealth of multiplayer options to hand, with both single and multi-cart play, plus the ability to go online. The single cart play, as is typical of DS games, is a frustratingly limited affair, with the guest unable to make substitutions - even if one of their players is injured, forcing them to play on with 10 men - and both players having to use the same two teams over and again, but the other options promise to squeeze a little extra life out of the cart.    And all this may make depressingly familiar reading to those who indulged in Pro Evolution 6 on the DS, as to all intents and purposes this is the same game. The same game that didn't exactly impress upon its release a year ago, and certainly doesn't inspire any positive sentiment now. PES is hardly known as the most forward thinking of series, with the gap between each iteration seemingly getting smaller and smaller year on year, but the baby steps taken by the new DS version really are so miniscule as to be almost undetectable.    It really is quite a struggle to recommend Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on any level whatsoever. Pro Evolution 6 was already a fairly weak offering, and the latest installment brings so very little to the party. With FIFA already offering a fairly respectable portrayal of the sport on the DS, theres no reason to even consider purchasing Pro Evolution Soccer 2008; its a redundant retread of already barren ground, failing as both an update or a standalone title. Its the Titus Bramble of football games  largely inadequate, lacking any flair and ultimately raising the question just what is the point.", "date": "Feb 6, 2008"}
