Consider the original trailer for the man-sucked-into-a-computer fantasy flick Tron which featured a camera slowly panning over a keyboard illuminated by blue light as deep-voiced narrator spoke ominously about the wonders of technology. Ooh, beware of keyboards! Tron took us ~inside~ a computer, where programs battled one another in high-tech versions of gladiatorial games. The favorite of these was what can best be described as Jai-Alai for crazy people. From this, the top-notch arcade game Discs of Tron was born (with Jai-Alai replaced by a Frisbee-like contest).   In Discs of Tron you play as the title character, dueling against the malicious Sark. Set in an enclosed rectangular arena, you throw discs at Sark, attempting to hit him squarely to ~derezz~ him. You can bounce the disc off walls, but so can Sark. Hopping from a set of circular platforms, you'll need to avoid Sark's discs and other powered attacks. It's a simple game, but the constant fire from Sark (and the need to stay mobile) can make for an intense experience. It's too bad that Digital Eclipse did such a poor job porting Discs of Tron to XBLA.    Your aiming reticule is attached to the wall of the arena. In the original arcade version, the reticule was controlled with a knob similar to the one used in Tempest. You could spin the knob quickly and get a surprising amount of precision at the same time. This is key as some of Sark's special attacks require you to move the reticule to the wall behind you. The XBLA version of Discs of Tron uses the right thumbstick for aiming. It's considerably slower than controls in the arcade, which is a problem in later stages. Precision aiming is almost impossible. If you aim straight ahead and nudge the thumbstick left or right, the reticule jumps several degrees. And in Discs of Tron, not having very fine manipulation of the reticule ruins the game. Simply put: This is an awful port.    The sloppiness continues with the ~enhanced~ graphics and sound. The new visuals come in the form of a nice background cityscape. The rest of the game remains largely as it did 25 years ago. What little effort was made to clean up the character models and add some visual oomph to the animations and special effects falls flat. It's a lazy attempt at repackaging a very old game. The sound is worse. In the arcade version, Sark had a few choice phrases he would utter after being defeated or when derezzing Tron. Though the sound was of a poor quality, you could clearly understand what Sark said. The XBLA version casts Ozzy Osbourne as Sark, mumbling incoherently with each action.   The big new addition is online multiplayer. Don't get your knickers damp; the multiplayer is worse than the single-player. There is no true head-to-head mode. Instead, you and a buddy play separate games at the same time. In VS mode as you compete for the best score; VS Speed Mode has you competing for the best score before time runs out; VS Deadly Disc adds power-ups that you can deploy to hinder your opponent (who is still playing a separate game); and Co-Op where you (again) play separate games, but your scores combine for some reason. This is great if: 1. You have a low opinion of the word ~great~; 2. The game didn't suffer from considerable slowdown.  The original Discs of Tron is one of my favorite games ever made. Anyone who only experiences Discs of Tron through this poor port won't understand why this game was ever held in high regard. It's a shame that a classic could be given such poor treatment with meager graphics, bad sound, and inaccurate controls. The one new element, the online multiplayer, runs poorly and is no fun to play. All-in-all, one of the worst XBLA ports to date.", "date": "Feb 12, 2008"}
