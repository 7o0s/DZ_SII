Maybe you've haven't played Nano Kid itself, per se, but you're already very familiar with its simple style of platformer play. The bright, colorful levels. Cutie-poo enemies donning googly-eyes. Crystal-collectin' madness. And if you liked this style of game back when it was a staple on the 8-bit systems, you'll love Nano Kid.   This lovely homage was developed by Swedish game designer Pocket Panic. The platformer genre is starting to get the royal treatment on mobile - witness Lavastorm's The Incredibles romp - but this title in particular seems to revel in looking backwards. Almost every play element in the game is instantly recognizable, such as the ability to control the hero's descent while falling. This feature is useful when you have control of the umbrella power-up, which slows your descent, allowing you to really swoop from side to side.   Because this is an 80s-style platformer, much attention is given to the fine art of collecting. Li'l Nano is charged with recovering oodles of crystals from each environment, including three special colored crystals that open each area's exit. These three special crystals are usually harder to pick up, as the last one always seems guarded by an enemy placed in an advantageous position or a gauntlet of environmental hazards, like spikes or water.   Nano Kid is quite a jumper, but in order to clear out the levels, he must rely on a few power-ups to clear a path. Rocks can be broken by hammers. Magic-spitting wands turn snails into escargot. And, as mentioned, umbrellas ease your drop velocity.    There are five different world in Nano Kid, taking your from a pleasant glen to a dangerous swamp. Each level is larger than your screen's real estate, spilling out in all directions. Of course, size is relative. Since Nano Kid himself is smaller than a snail, everything is going to look big. We were really struck by the game's use of color. It seems no corner of the palette went untouched, as the game's use of bright reds and yellows looks great against the vibrant greens and blues that make up the most of the game's levels.   Because I am a child of the eighties, Im a sucker for games like Nano Kid. I grew up playing the SEGA Master System, and this game seems like a design that fell through the cracks. Like those old games, Nano Kid provides an adequate amount of challenge. This was not designed to be beaten in an hour. As the crystals get harder and harder to capture, you must use your noggin to discern the best path through the level. It makes the game deliriously addictive.
