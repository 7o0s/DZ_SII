{"name": "Sam and Max Season 2: #2", "name_review": "Sam and Max 202, Moai Better Blues", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/08/sam-and-max-202-moai-better-blues", "text": "When last we left the deranged duo, they were solving some tricky problems at the North Pole. After putting Santa safely in Hell, they've returned to their increasingly chaotic block only to discover Sybil being pursued by ~a rogue semi-sentient inter-dimensional portal.~ When Sybil and Abe are sucked into the portal, Sam and Max decide to follow them to see what sorts of problems they can solve. And if they can create some more problems along the way, so much the better.  Though there's a bit of business to be transacted at Stinky's Diner and Bosco's Inconvenience Store, most of the action takes place on the other side of the portal on Easter Island. A trio of talking Moai statues clue Sam and Max in to a recent prophecy involving an angry volcano god, a shoeless dog and a big mouth with ears. Needless to say, there are plenty of opportunities for humor here and the writers and actors really run with the premise. From the infantified versions of famous missing pilots to the trademark-dodging Ocean Chimps, there are dozens of hilarious bits to be enjoyed.   Even without relying on the new hint systems, we found that the overall experience was a bit shorter than previous episodes; we hit the credits in a little over two hours, which is about an hour or so earlier than we've been able to finish the previous installments. But the good news is that the challenge and humor are even more concentrated this time around. There's very little of the back and forth errands in this installment so you'll stay more focused on the tasks at hand. There's even one puzzle that requires you to find a shortcut to eliminate lengthy trips back and forth from location to location.  It was a little unusual that the old locations weren't used more. The office has nothing for you, Jimmy's new house is merely a diversion, and Sybil's is completely closed. Even the two locations you do get to revisit are somewhat peripheral. You'll only visit Bosco's to find out about his latest paranoid delusion and to steal a single item. Stinky's is put to better use with some interesting throwaway elements that we're hoping actually lead to some real payoffs down the road.  Fortunately, the new location is more than interesting enough to carry the action. Easter Island is home to three large talking Moai statues, who really steal the show. Sure, there are other characters, like Baby Glenn Miller and the Ocean Chimps who provide their own laughs, but most of the humor comes from these three large and strangely humorless heads. Our personal favorite is the half-buried Storm head, who delivers his lines in a muffled whisper that had us laughing from start to finish. Abe Lincoln's head naturally has some unusual (but not entirely unpredictable) feelings about finding himself on an island populated by giant stone heads, which leads to some great bits of dialogue.   This episode sees the return of Flint Paper, the detective who shares a wall with Sam and Max, but he's in and out of the story so quickly that we can only hope he's being saved for something more meaningful down the road. Thankfully, the Soda Poppers are nowhere to be seen in this episode and, in our opinion, it's about time they made their exit. Their inclusion in the previous episode felt tacked on and, worse still, wasn't even funny. Now that they're gone, the other characters have a little more breathing room.  The humor is a little more highbrow this time around, including references that many people under 30 probably aren't going to get. We like that Telltale is showing tremendous confidence in the hipness of their fans by including jokes about icosahedrons, D.B Cooper, the Gong Show and the Count Basie, but unless you know who Glenn Miller is (and how he died), it's going to be hard to see some of the humor here.      On the other hand, the game makes use of more topical humor that will definitely appeal to potheads and gamers of any age. When the COPS introduce their music video game by saying ~Boom! Did we just blow your mind?~ it's hard not to laugh. The throwaway gags -- like why it's called Easter Island, the new candy called Beef-Tarts, and Max's mysterious 12-monkey chili -- are among the funniest asides the series has delivered.  Following the pattern set by Ice Station Santa, the puzzles in Moai Better Blues are much more involved and require multiple leaps of logic. There's nothing too terribly hard here, of course, but the puzzles are tied together so well that you feel like they're all part of one large challenge rather than a series of isolated and unconnected problems. We don't want to give anything away, of course, but just seeing how a bagpipe driving mini-game at the very beginning of the game unlocks a succession of puzzles that ultimately have a direct impact on the game's final challenge just makes the whole experience so much more satisfying. Sure, some of the connections are a bit arbitrary but they all work according to the logical lunacy of the Sam and Max world, so they don't ever feel too gamey. The middle part of that sequence where you're trying to figure out how to get water from the Fountain of Youth was particularly inventive.   The inclusion of yet another driving sequence might seem more formulaic than fun but, we have to admit, that the team found a way to work in a really humorous element to the challenge that made it feel like more than just an obligatory reflex test. (The fact that you can use the keyboard is a huge boost.) Even more exciting is the new Wipeout minigame, that was fun enough that we played it a few times before we even knew what we were supposed to be playing it for. Once we discovered that, it became even more challenging and enjoyable.  Visually, there are no real surprises here. The big heads and little babies are alternately adorable and totally creepy, and the tropical setting is well designed and convincing. Some of the small touches, like the materials that have wound up being swallowed up by the interdimensional portal, or the look on the Earth head once he's ~mellowed out~ are priceless.  The voice work is as good as ever, with some really great performances by the Moai heads. Their dialogue is delivered with a great mixture of gravity (because they're made of rocks) and levity (because it's Sam and Max). The babies lay it on a little thick with their accents but the person playing Glenn Miller does a great job of capturing the nerdy, eager innocence that seems to fit the character so well. As always, the musical score serves to add a healthy dose of hip style to an otherwise ridiculous world.   Moai Better Blues is shorter and smaller than previous installments in the series. Compared to the sprawling locales and stories of Reality 2.0 or Situation: Comedy, this episode seems almost too short. But size and length isn't an indication of quality. If anything, the smaller scale means that there's no filler here. Everything you come across is pure comedic content. Moai Better Blues never loses its focus so you'll get as much enjoyment out of its two-hour length than the three or four hours you spent playing some of the previous episodes. Add in puzzles that require multiple leaps of logic and a longer memory and it's easy to see why we're so encouraged by the direction that Telltale is taking this series.", "date": "Jan 8, 2008"}
