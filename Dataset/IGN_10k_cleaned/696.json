Actually, a more accurate statement would be that Columns has arrived on the Dreamcast dressed in Sakura Wars.  Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2 takes columns and cleverly surrounds it in the Sakura Wars universe, complete with all the characters, music, and social interaction you'd expect.  The result?  An instant pleaser for Sakura Wars fans everywhere.First, a slight explanation of the name.  Hanagumi is Japanese for ~Flower Branch,~ the group that you, as Oogami, command in Sakura Wars 1 and 2.  Taisen is Japanese for ~Great War~ . . . ~Sakura Wars~ when spoken in Japanese is actually ~Sakura Taisen.~  The ~Columns 2~ part comes about as this is the sequel to a 1997 Saturn game.  So, you have ~Flower Branch Great War Columns 2,~ or as I prefer it, ~Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2.~If you're unfamiliar with Sakura Wars, here's the background story.  A looser seaman called Oogami Ichiro in 1900 Japan's Imperial Navy is commissioned to take command of the Hanagumi (flower branch) of the Teikokukagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group), a group formed by the government to protect Tokyo from demons.  By day, the eight girls who form the Hanagumi serve as actresses in a theatrical group.  But when the demons attack, the girls and Oogami board their mechs and head out to the battle field for strategic, turn-based battle.  Parts 1 and 2 of the series were laid out like a series of Japanese animation episodes, with between ten and fourteen episodes per game.  Each episode consisted of your moving around the Teikokukagekidan base and interacting with the Hanagumi members, followed by a battle, followed usually by a bit more interaction, then another battle, then a preview of the next episode.Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2 takes the basic idea behind Sakura Wars and replaces the strategic battles with Columns-based battles.  The whole game just looks like a Sakura Wars product, with all the animation, voices, and presentation you'd expect of a full fledged Sakura game.In one player mode, you have access, initially, to a story mode, a battle mode, an endless columns mode, and a puzzle mode.  The battle mode allows you to select from among the eight characters, who are rated on attack, speed, and defense, select an elemental power up, which gives the character a special ability, and play columns against a computer-controlled opponent.  As you make gems disappear, a power-up meter fills up.  Reach the maximum level, and you can either unleash an attack of time-released blocks on your opponent, clear a few rows from your side, or charge up your attack meter so the next time you reach max, you'll be able to unleash a more powerful attack.  It's pretty typical stuff, except the animation in the background and the character vocal comments give the game an unmistakable Sakura Wars flair.  You even get to hear the catchy MIDI music from the series when taking on an opponent, but it's now done using the Dreamcast's more powerful sound hardware and sounds a bit cleaner than before.The puzzle mode is a nice little addition that allows you to work on your Columns skills, as you're presented with one hundred puzzles which require you to do various tasks, from making a set of special gems disappear in a given time to making all the gems appear using a set number of blocks.  This is all done with one of the Hanagumi girls looking upon you, encouraging you every step of the way.  Trying to figure out how to get past a particularly difficult puzzle usually comes down to placing one or two blocks appropriately, something that usually ends up working your brain, unless you're a geometric puzzle wizzard.  I had to enlist some help to get past a few of the puzzles.It's all good, though, because the puzzle mode ain't the real area of interest in the game for the hardcore Sakura Wars fan out there.  The story mode is the real deal, and it gives us as close to a new Sakura Wars experience as we're going to get until September of this year.  You select a character, and proceed through a conversation-based adventure, with you and the character wandering around the Daiteikokukagekidan, talking with other characters, and occasionally taking to a match of Columns, either puzzle-based or battle-based.  The conversations are loosely interactive, using the time-based response system found in part 2, complete with answers appearing mid-way through the time limit; I even encountered one of those time-based investigation conversations, where you have to keep asking the on-screen character questions until time runs out.  If your responses should please your character of choice, you'll hear that distinctive beeping sound characteristic of the series, and the character's statistics during the subsequent round of columns will increase - an ingenious way of combining the series with Columns. These sections look and feel like they're pulled straight from part 2 of the game, complete with the same screen layout and proportions, and most of the same animated facial shots, although I did notice a few new ones in there.  There's zero dithering this time around, and whatever load time from part 2 has been pretty much removed, but don't expect anything near a next generation Sakura Wars game.  In other words, don't play the game thinking ~This is a good look at what we'll be getting from part 3 of the series~).The individual stories during the story mode are moderately inventive, although you'll find  clich themes such as a case of amnesia being cured by a good bopping on the noggin'.  Regardless, just like in the standard games, the production values here are so high that you probably won't care - full screen animation shots for the endings would've made the experience more fullfilling, though.  I also wish the stories were a bit more interactive, with your being required to respond to a greater number of questions - let's hope The Red Company has plans to do this in part 3 of the series.That's basically all there is to the Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2 one player experience, but for Sakura Wars fans like myself, it's more than enough.  Passing the game multiple times will earn you new modes and some special gifts, although I think you have to go online to access some of them, as there are some options that are still missing for me.  There are multiplayer modes in the game as well, which definitely add to the longevity.  You can compete against a friend in the two player mode, and even go online to chat and play the game over the network.  Hmm . . . network play in a Sakura Wars game, and we American folk can't even go online with Rally 2 . . . sigh!This game is definitely a must-buy for all Sakura Wars fans, myself included.  Hey - you'd have to buy it just based on the inclusion of six limited edition trading cards, right?  If you're interested in just picking up a good Columns game, you'll find it here as well - the puzzles should work towards refining your Columns skills considerably.A warning to the Sakura Wars fans looking to just see everything there is to see in the game.  The computer is extremely difficult during the Columns matches, meaning you may face some frustration when trying to get through the story mode for a given character.  The game does try to make things easier on players who are having trouble by making the computer opponent weaker each time you loose, but you'll have to work on your Columns skills if you want to go anywhere in this particular Sakura Wars game.  Then again, anyone who wants to visit Sakura, Iris, Maria, Sumire, and the rest of the crew once again will surely manage to make the time.-- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 9, 2000"}
