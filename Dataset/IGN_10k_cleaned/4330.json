And before Activision established itself with games like Tony Hawk, it started as the first third-party publisher, creating games for the Atari 2600. The industry has come a long way since those days, but it's always great to see the roots with compilation packs of classics released during the early years of gaming. Activision Anthology is the latest pack of classics for the Game Boy Advance, and Aspyr has created a fantastic compilation with an excellent easy-to-navigate interface and a slew of extras...including a handful of original games created well after the fall of the 2600. Features More than sixty 2600 games running on an emulator Unlockable patches Cartridge save for high scores Link cable support for two players  More than sixty Atari 2600 games are in this pack, spanning Activision's early years:   Barnstorming  Boxing  Checkers  Chopper Command  Cosmic Commuter  Crackpots  Dolphin  Dragster  Enduro  Fishing Derby  Freeway  Frostbite  Grand Prix  H.E.R.O.  Ice Hockey  Kaboom!  Keystone Kapers  Laser Blast  Megamania  Oink!  Pitfall!  Plaque Attack  Pressure Cooker  Private Eye   River Raid  River Raid 2  Seaquest  Skiing  Sky Jinks  Spider Fighter  Stampede  Starmaster  Tennis  Title Match  Baseball  Beamrider  Bloody Human Freeway  Bridge  Decathlon  Pitfall 2  Robot Tank  Skateboardin'  Space Shuttle  Tomcat F14  Venetian Blinds  Kabobber   Thwocker   There are also several homebrew 2600 games included in this pack:  Climber 5  Okie Dokie  Oystron  Skeleton+  SpaceThreat Deluxe  Vault Assault  Video Euchre  Activision Anthology is an incredibly close representation of the compilation pack of the same name released on the PlayStation 2 system last year. The PS2 version was actually used as a blueprint for the GBA project's presentation, as it shares similar interface. Games are selected via the same rotating cartridge stack, but they're now listed alphabetically instead of by year...a definite improvement. Some changes had to be made to get the package to fit on a Game Boy Advance cartridge: cartridge and box art archives are now limited to lower resolution scans instead of 3D modeled versions, and the instruction manuals are now simple text-based versions instead of scans of the original. And the wonderful licensed 80s soundtrack has been nixed; in its place are five original tunes that feature a very 80s flavor. They're no Flock of Seagulls, sure, but the new music definitely fits the ~retro~ theme.   Due to some licensing issues, Atlantis and Demon Attack -- two Imagic games -- have been removed from the PS2 Activision Anthology They've replaced with several homebrew originals programmed by members of the retrogaming community. These extras a great addition and expand the pack, but  they really should have been given their own section instead of mixed in with the other games, since they have absolutely no relation to what Activision created for the Atari 2600 during those years.   The most important aspect of Activision Anthology is, of course, just how well the Game Boy Advance can portray these games.  Even though the 2600 was one of the earliest videogame system on the market, believe it or not it's an absolute beast of gaming hardware to emulate properly on other systems. Getting an NES game to run on the Game Boy Advance is a cakewalk compared to what developers have to do to make the GBA hardware to think it's the 25 year old Atari VCS.  With that said, the Atari 2600 emulator used in the GBA Activision Anthology is relatively close to a perfect recreation. The emulator has a few shortcuts implemented to make the games work at an acceptable speed and resolution, and these optimizations are specific to each game. Most of the titles have had the ~Activision~ and copyright branding bar removed so the image can fit on the lower resolution GBA screen. Some games have a slightly lower framerate, most obvious in scrolling designs like Grand Prix and Barnstorming These alterations are perfectly acceptable and in no way affect the fun or playability of any of the titles in the pack.  But it does have to be mentioned that, even with these tweaks, many games are slightly slower than their original speed; the emulated versions on the Game Boy Advance run at about 90%. There's no doubt that purists will notice that their favorite Activision games aren't running quite as fast as they original did on the 2600, but anyone new to the retrogaming scene probably won't sense something's amiss, or even care. These games are best played on the original hardware and original controller, but the Game Boy Advance system does a wonderful job offering the original Activision experience.  For two player games, the developer implemented an interesting link cable idea: only one cartridge is needed, but that system will send just a basic program to a second GBA system in the chain that only transmits the button presses to the first system. Player two must view the action on the GBA with the cartridge. It can get a little awkward, and it was probably a technical compromise since networking GBAs would have probably been a tough task with an emulator sucking up all the processor bandwidth. It's definitely better than not having a two player option at all, that's for sure. And while it's best played on the GBA portables, it's pretty slick on the GameCube's Game Boy Player.  Aspyr went the extra mile for this pack and has included save RAM that records the high scores for the games that actually kept track of that sort of thing; these scores are displayed outside the game on a bulletin board for all to see, but they get posted anonymously. The cartridge save also records if you've unlocked those coveted Activision patches, and this time, it takes absolute skill to acquire the collection. The PS2 version of Activision Anthology reduced the score requirements to make earning patches a relatively easy task...but for GBA gamers, the point structure returns to their original level making the collection a much more rewarding experience. Good luck getting 100,000 in Laser Blast, or 3,000 points in Kaboom., because these were levels that were hard to obtain when the games originally came out. I'm fully aware what's required for an Atari 2600 emulator to work, so I'm actually not surprised that the emulation on the GBA isn't running entirely at the full speed of the original hardware. I'm also not disappointed, either; even though I'm one of those retrogaming ~purists,~ these original Atari games are still fully playable, still challenging, and still a whole lot of fun...and they fit the portable market perfectly. The also marks the  first time a GBA retro pack includes a cartridge save for high scores, a definite thumbs up to Aspyr for this function. And the fact that the ~patch~ scores are now back up to their original rates gives gamers something to shoot for. This compilation pack is incredibly well-produced despite the speed, and should not be missed.", "date": "Dec 11, 2003"}
