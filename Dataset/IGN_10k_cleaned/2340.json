The classic arcade game helped create a new genre of ~freeway crossing~ games in the early '80s and proved to be one of the most highly successful franchises of its time. Its gameplay was very simple in nature, but like most great arcade games during this time period it pulled you in with addictive gameplay that made you rely on your hand-eye coordination and fast reflexes. The Frogger name definitely holds some weight and if you need further proof of this, check out this piece of information -- Hasbro's 1998 3D remake of the game, titled simply Frogger, has gone on to sell more than 3 million units, making it one of the top selling PlayStation games of all time. Why is all this pertinent? With Frogger: The Great Quest, Konami and its Papa Yeti Team at Konami of America has decided to do something completely different with the series and put Frogger into an entirely new 3D platform/adventure game where he walks on two feet instead of hopping around. It's absolutely nothing at all like the Frogger games that you might have played in the past.GameplayFrogger: The Great Quest is 100%, straightforward platform/adventure gameplay. Think of it as something like Rayman 2, but with a Frogger as the main character instead of Ubi Soft's limbless hero. In fact, if you've played Rayman 2 on any of the various platforms that it's been released on, you should have a good idea about what the basic gameplay mechanics will be like in Frogger.Rayman could shoot these magical balls with his hand; Frogger shoots goobers out of his mouth. Rayman had the ability to glide after a jump by using his helicopter ears; Frogger can do the same by using his expanding throat. Rayman could climb up and down these vines located on walls; Frogger can do the same thing on vines that look pretty similar to what they looked like in Rayman 2. Finally, in Rayman 2 you could use the R1 button to dodge or strafe around an enemy during battle and in Frogger you can do the exact same thing. The only real differences are that Frogger lacks a lot of the special abilities that Rayman had (like using his shot to swing from ring to ring) and has a few things in his arsenal that Rayman couldn't do, such as his close-combat Frog-Fu and the ability to use these Magic Stones that are basically these different power-up skills. Obviously, patterning Frogger after a game as highly respected as Rayman 2 is definitely not a bad thing and the idea of throwing a well-known character into a package that has proven to be successful is a very intelligent one. The problem here is that while Frogger: The Great Quest has a lot of great ideas and cool design elements, it completely fails at the most important of levels -- the basic control.The control in this game is among the worst I've ever experience in a 3D platform/adventure game of this kind. Frogger's movement is really choppy, a bit unresponsive and downright frustrating at times.  You'll undoubtedly lose count of the number of times that you fall off some ledge or cliff, or miss a jump because of the game's poor controls and not because poor hand-eye coordination on your part. Even worse is the game's jumping mechanics that makes is painstakingly difficult to do simple things like jumping on a mushroom that you're standing next to.All of this is made worse by the game's horrific camera controls. The camera does a poor job of following Frogger when you're moving around the world and there's no way to move around the camera yourself manual except for the ability to reset the camera behind you by pressing the L2 button. Because of this, you will constantly find yourself doing things like getting stuck in a corner, falling off a ledge or just going the wrong way because the camera is often put into the worst of positions. This is especially painful in many of the later levels that you have playing in more confined areas and doing things at a higher pace. For instance in one of the stages where you must play tag with the fairies, since the action is fairly quick and you have to reverse direction a lot, you can expect to encounter numerous instances where you're going to be trying to view the action with a huge tree or rock in front of you instead of the character. Likewise, when in boss fights, which are all so simple that you just need to hold down the strafe button, left or right, and keep firing until the boss dies, it's quite common for the camera to find itself below the ground while you're strafing. So, instead of seeing what you're doing, you get a bird's eye view of the part of this 3D world that you're not supposed to be looking at.It's kind of sad that it plays so poorly, because there's actually some cool stuff here. The story, while completely  clich (Frogger wants to find the princess of his dreams so she can kiss him and turn him into a prince), is actually told quite well through the CG cut scenes between each level and through the character interaction during gameplay. What's more, it has some nice homage's to other games including both Nintendo's classic Super Mario Bros. and Konami's own Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Throughout the game you'll save princesses that aren't the right one until you finish the game, which is what Super Mario Bros. is all about and one of the boss characters is this big mechanical chicken called Metal Chicken Ray, which is introduced much like the Metal Gear Ray was in MGS2.Sadly, the cool things about the game are completely overshadowed by its control and camera problems that make it not worth playing. And even if you happen to get used to the shoddy controls, which is actually possible, it's over before you really begin as the game takes about three hours to beat and there's not much reason to play it more than once as the pictures that you can buy with the gems and coins that you collect aren't worth the trouble.GraphicsThe gameplay isn't the only part of Frogger that shows some inspiration from Rayman 2, as the game's look and visual style seems strikingly similar to Ubi Soft's game. The 3D environments are filled with really bright and vibrant colors and lushly designed background objects. And while some of the textures you'll see a fairly bland and low-res, the texture work in some of the latter levels is often quite impressive. There will undoubtedly be many times when you're playing this game where you say to yourself, ~this is a pretty game.~What hurts the game's graphics is that there's an enormous amount of clipping problems, which are made even worse by the game's poor camera direction. And even though the game does run at 60 frames per second at times, the framerate will drop down to sub-10 fps levels when there are a lot of objects in view at once, particularly in instances where you try and look around the world in the first-person perspective. It's definitely pretty at times, but there are just way too many graphical glitches and flaws to be overlooked.SoundJust about all of the characters that you encounter in the game have voices and there's quite a bit of speech. The voices are quite annoying at times, but they actually all really fit the characters that they're portraying quite well. And the ones that are mimicking movie characters, such as the Doctor who talks like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, can be very comical.The thing that hurts the voice work in the game is that none of the lines seem to fit together all that well, so the voices you hear seem more like single sentences instead of parts of a conversation. Part of this is tied to the fact that you need to press a button between each line, but they don't always sound quite right regardless.The soundtrack for the game is about what you'd expect from a game staring a ~cute~ platform-type hero, as it's mostly fun, happy, and very chipper. Most of it is only average stuff, but some of the more foreboding tunes that pop up in the last few levels in the game are really nice to listen to and do a great job of changing the mood of the game to fit the circumstance.I really think that some of the level designs are quite good and believe that the game's developers did an excellent job of creating a fun 3D world for Frogger to roam that's filled with lots of enemies to combat and friendly characters to interact with, but it's all for not because the game's control is about as bad as it gets. I've tried really hard to think of a 3D platform/adventure game that has controls as terrible as what's presented here in Frogger: The Great Quest but am honestly drawing blanks. The character movement is very choppy, the jumping is imprecise and it's all made even worse by the game's many camera problems. All of those boring and completely un-inspired Disney- and cartoon-licensed games that have found their way onto the PlayStation over the last couple of years have at least offered reasonable control despite not presenting anything imaginative or innovative.  In fact, I'd venture to say that some of the all-time classic debacles like Bubsy 3D and Blasto have superior control in comparison to this game. There is absolutely no reason to buy or rent this game. We recommend that you avoid it at all costs and don't even think about letting your children or younger siblings near it.", "date": "Dec 1, 2001"}
