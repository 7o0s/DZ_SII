The Wii's been available less than a month, its Virtual Console service active only a few weeks, and already the games to download are stepping on each other's toes. Nintendo's own NES Pinball is rendered nearly obsolete now, with the release of this, Hudson's TurboGrafx pin game, Alien Crush. It's only 100 points more in the Wii Shop, but this extraterrestrial-themed pinball game offers much more than 100 more points' worth of fun.It's biological warfare as you, humble star warrior armed only with a silver sphere, seek to do battle against a two-screen-tall monstrous menace from a galaxy far, far away. The aliens have arrived, taking the form of bumpers and plungers, launchers and traps as you attempt to flip and tilt your way to a high score. Gameplay is conventional for a pinner  you control two sets of left and right flippers in much the same way as NES Pinball, one set on the top half of the table and the other guarding the gutter below. Unlike NES Pinball, though, you can tilt the Alien Crush table with a button press. The jostling action may save your ball from impending doom, or simply worsen an already grim situation. For the highest scores, you'll have to master the art of the bump.           Thousands more points can be found and gathered in Alien Crush's hidden bonus rooms. These separate, single-tall screens are locked and inaccessible at the beginning of each round of play, but executing specific table actions will open their doors. Once inside, you'll find targeting challenges and swarms of destructible enemies, and sometimes even ~boss fights~ that, if completed, will significantly increase your point total.That only-possible-in-video-game-pinball convention has lived on in more recent games, as we could look at titles like Nintendo's Pokmon Pinball or Metroid Prime Pinball and see the inspiration that came from Alien Crush. This Turbo title is an important installment in the industry's pinball genre, and set the bar high for those games to come after it in later years. The only thing holding back Alien Crush today is its comparatively limited scope  it only has one table to play, and while it's a great table, modern gamers may want a more robust offering.The Wii is quickly becoming a go-to game machine for pinball enthusiasts, with both Alien Crush and NES Pinball available through the Virtual Console and Gottlieb Pinball Classics arriving on a traditional, physical disc (though not in the States just yet). This particular download is one that longtime TurboGrafx fans are certainly appreciative to see. Those same fans, though, would point out that Alien Crush's sequel, Devil's Crush, is a superior title. If you only have a few points to spend, you might consider the course of patience to wait and see if the demonic follow-up arrives later on the service. Otherwise, jump right in, cash in 600, and experience the outer space original.", "date": "Dec 12, 2006"}
