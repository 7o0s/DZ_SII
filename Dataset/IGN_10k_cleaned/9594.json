From the get-go Shadow infuses the entire effort with his trademark aural sensibilities. What this means is that he borrows and snipes from a wide range of global musical inspirations, churning it all together to create an undulating blast of soniference.    Taking somewhat atonal strings (sounds like some Middle Eastern or West African gourded instrument), combining them with echo flange, clacking stick infused rhythms, pipes of pan, and thundering Taiko drums, DJ Shadow creates an intensely driven intro to his ~megamix~ of score elements from the in-game soundtrack to Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, as originally composed by Greg Edmonson.   In typical Shadow form the latter's orchestrally rich score is all but buried amidst thunderclap rhythmic interchange, thrombobulating bass urgency, and cascading walls of eeriness that alternately sounds like whooshing windstorms, didgeridoo-on-acid, and guttural tribal chanting.    At the core of Shadow's construct is a driving backbeat, jazz-funk drumming on overload that keeps the beat injected with plenty of ~umph!~ But where he could very easily have laid down a non-stop flurry of renegade world weary funk, he chooses instead to manipulate the beat, dropping it completely out of the picture for added emotional fortitude one minute, switching it up to nothing more than muted Taiko and didgeridoo the next, and even going full-tilt for quietude that is slowly replaced by symphonic undertones.   The end result is a tune that conveys all the mysticism, danger, and potential nefarious underpinnings that a treasure seeking soldier of fortune could ever hope to encounter.  Strange as it may sound, in many ways DJ Shadow's ~The El Dorado Megamix~ sounds like the perfect soundtrack to a long lost episode of Danger Island, albeit with more of a lost-in-the-Amazon-and-chased by-poison-dart-wielding natives and/or villainous arch rival treasure hunters with armor piercing weaponry. Whatever the case, Shadow has taken elements of Edmonson's score and retrofitted them with the proper amount of emotional frenzy.   As for the rest of this EP, it consists of three pieces culled from Edmonson's in-game score. ~Drake's Elegy~ is all sweeping symphonics, with a strong emphasis on strings. ~Nate's Theme~ is a bit more upbeat, going for a bit of a ceremonial urgency thanks to horns and percussion. ~Sanctuary?~ pretty much lives up to the question mark in its title, mixing shifting electronics with orchestral elements to create an ominous sense of confusion.   While the three snippets from Edmonson's score are enthralling, the real thrust of this release is the DJ Shadow megamix, which is nothing short of a near-vibrant listening experience on its own.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
