Skyzone's Two Scoop Twist, an import that bears all of the tell-tale signs of its Korean development -- clever twist on what could have been a mundane idea, excellent control implementation, and silly/attractive graphics.   You are the proprietor of a meager ice cream stand, but you have designs on an empire. In order to reach your dream of a successful parlor, you have to schlep scoops to bratty kids in a rainy park, saving every penny to replenish spent sweet stocks. You start out with just a few flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Soon, you'll need to invest in grape, coffee, and mint flavored treats. Customers will start ordering double-scoops, so you have to remember orders as you flip through your stock. Pretty soon, you have to indulge them with toppings like sprinkles, almonds, and chocolate syrup. Orders can get complicated and you don't have forever to serve them before they storm off and lower your awareness rating in the neighborhood. Just when you finally get the hang of scoops and topping, the game introduces soft serve ice creams, too, making it even harder to serve the fickle masses with speed and accuracy. If you botch a cone, the customer doesn't pay and you lose the ice cream you tried to serve.   Between rounds, you must invest in supplies, like restocking ice cream and toppings. You can also buy a security monitor, which will help keep robbers at bay. Every once in a while, a masked man will stage a hold-up, in which you can either soothe them in hopes they accept less money, or get aggressive and scare them off. Misread the robber, though, and you'll end up losing a lot of dough.   The game gives you goals, such as buying a new flavor before reaching a specific day, but for the most part, you are free to tweak your strategy however you see fit. For example, you could try to weather the rainy days by putting out advertising, but do you dare splurge on radio ads when newspaper ads are much cheaper? The newspaper ads could be over by the time the weather clears and you'll be out of the public conscious. If you had bought radio ads, by the time the weather turned nice, you could have a line around the block. However, if the weather stayed crappy, the extra scratch might be for not -- especially if you blew off too many customers with bad service.   Two Scoop is a cute game, filled with silly little heads that pop up in front of your window to order their favorite flavor. (Who knew the Grim Reaper likes strawberry?) The interface is nice and clean. Even though the icons for scrolling through flavors and toppings are small, they are completely unmistakable, something I was worried about when the choices started expanding. But when I blew an order, it was only one guy's fault.   I really like games like this -- they are insidious and addictive. I originally sat down to play a few days, just to see if the game was any good. By the time I shut the phone, I was on day 27 and had gone downstairs to hook the phone up to my charger so I could keep playing. I'd be playing it more now, but, well, I've got other games to peek at, too.  Kudos to Skyzone for seeing the potential of Two Scoop Twist. Unbranded games often get overlooked on the decks, but this is a treat for the adventurous. The game can be played in short doses, if so desired, but with the rapid succession of goals and daily income, there is always a sense of progress. If you've played Lemonade Tycoon to death and need another industrial-strat-sim fix, Two Scoop Twist will definitely fit the bill.", "date": "Jun 6, 2006"}
