Lavin's Ultimate BMX", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/01/mtv-sports-tj-lavins-ultimate-bmx-4", "text": "THQ has tried and tried again with the MTV sports thing, and with the possible exception of MTV Sports: Pure Ride, none of them have made the grade. It's too bad, too, because the idea behind extreme sports and MTV sounds somehow like it's the right combination of marketing and gaming goodness, but I guess it's just too damn hard to create a game that comes close to Tony Hawk.   Yes, even a BMX game is compared to the mighty Tony Hawk. And since nobody can match up to the mighty Activision series, let's compare TJ Lavin's Ultimate BMX to a lesser god, Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX. In every comparable aspect, from feel, control, and response, to camera angles, level design, and multiplayer, TJ Lavin doesn't nudge off Acclaim's BMX effort. I wish that it wasn't so, but it is. TJ Lavin's Ultimate BMX was not worth the wait, and if you're in the market for a BMX game, either get Dave Mirra, or I suggest waiting for Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX from Activision.   Gameplay TJ Lavin's game is not horrible, but it's definitely mediocre from head to toe. In a BMX game, or a game of this style, the object is to get a groove going by laying down some intuitive tracks, providing the player with smooth controls, the ability to grind, and to make the gamers want to try again and again. You know, to create a kind of addiction, a love for the game. Well, every time any chance of that love had the opportunity to grow here, it was squashed like a biker's nuts on a missed rail. It's not like the formula is wrong, it's been clearly copied and pasted from Tony Hawk, and we all know that works well. It's the complete lack of attention to detail and refinement. It's in the delivery of the thing.   TJ Lavin breaks down pretty much right away with the camera system. It's not broken per say, but so many times I found myself jumping off a ramp and the camera swinging around my head and literally confusing me that it absolutely interferes with the gameplay. And that's bad. Bad, THQ. On a jump, I know where I should land, I know that if I pull off the right move, or pretty much any move, I'll land back on the ramp. Yet, too many times the camera swerves around, sometimes, in the darndest of places, that it brought the question into my head, ~Where the hell am I?~ Not a good question to ask.   In another situation, the camera literally panned underneath me, showing through the bottom of the ramp (which is just blue emptiness) and following the bottom of my bike... Other times, I got confused from the perspectives and when landed, I hit a closer ramp that I didn't want to hit, and bit it. In short, the camera system is so weak that it undermines the most basic of gameplay elements, and drastically decreases any initial love I might have had.   At least the trick system isn't entirely botched. Players can change the control to as many as four different setups, all based on the four symbols on the controller. The basic default mapping is perfectly good, triangle for Rails, X for Pedal/Hop, Square is Bike trick, and Circle is Body trick. Players can rotate by pressing R1 and L1 and by pressing R2 and L2 together you can pull off the Wall Ride. The tricks themselves link together for combinations and added points, especially if you land several in a row, and especially if you throw in rails.   The tricks link together well enough, though the game looks quite horrific when these things are exercised, and that's partially because the animation is horrible. But I had some big problems with the actual jumping aspect of the game. I never got enough air to pull off the kinds of tricks I wanted (like in other BMX games), and I was never quite sure when I would land. Another aspect of why the controls, such as jumping, were poorly handled is because the collision detection is sloppy and inconsistent, and then there's that camera system adding to all the troubles again.    As for the Tricks system, it again is standard fare. You can find gears to unlock cool stuff, such as levels, or to add extra characteristics units to your pro rating. Even there I had some problems, because in one level, I was required to find some flashers. What the hell are flashers? My first thought was, you know, flashers -- people who flash their genitals at other people for fun. I looked and looked and couldn't find any flashers, but I did, by accident, find some roadwork stands with flashing lights on them, and hey! I got a little message that said only five left! Yes, I did in the end solve the Flasher puzzle, but I was disappointed. I would really have liked to see genital flashing people scaring civilians all across the levels. That would have been fresh and creative, and certainly livened up the game a bit.   The three modes in the game include Pro Career, Practice, and Two-player, and while I have mostly been talking about the Pro Career, the two-player levels do indeed enable people to play two player games, but after having played the single player game more than I wanted, the two-player games only enhanced the major problems the single player games had. In short, they unfortunately weren't worth the trouble.   Graphics Where to start? TJ Lavin wears a kind of ragged yet hip jacket of flashing menu items, neat fonts, and a generally cool exterior. The menu system is straightforward and intuitive, and you never find yourself wishing it were done another way. The actual graphics in the game, however, are a different story. TJ Lavin is like a second wave PlayStation game in many respects. In addition to posing seriously annoying and problematic camera angles, the perspective correction of the textures themselves makes the whole game look and feel like the dried layer of film that gathers at the top of a steaming on glass of milk, but when it's dried up and crumbling. It's fragile, it doesn't taste good, and it's unwanted. Every texture, from the ground textures to ramps, trees, and roads moves around like crazy. It looks horrible.   In addition to this, the texture clipping in this game boasts more seams than a poor woman's handmade dress (nothing against poor woman with bad dresses, mind you). There are empty blue sections of the game everywhere, and when you aren't looking through some walls, you're looking through something else that's not supposed to be seen. Again, I suppose that's essentially the miserable camera at work again, but you just shouldn't see through to the blue netherworld more than say 25 times in a few levels. You know? Oh, and did I mention the framerate is poor? No? It is poor, like a recently graduated liberal arts student with no job and no cash.   In an overall sense, TJ Lavin just looks sloppy and unfinished, and that's being nice. Acclaim's game, Dave Mirra, may not have a great framerate, but TJ Lavin's sloppy code comes in a distant third in the BMX category. And Mat Hoffman isn't even out yet. I'm sorry but it's true.   Sound Well, at least in this category, I can say that I learned about new alternative bands. And that I got to know the California Sky song REALLY WELL. I'll do it this way, here are the band names, and the songs, respectively, and you decide if you like them: Ghoulspoon, Fever; SR-71, Right Now; Kottonmouth Kings, Crucial; P.O.D. Rock the Party Off the Hook; Frenzal Rhomb, Mr. Charisma; Hotwire, Cyanide Baby; Millencollin, Fox; UBX, Shut Up; Unwritten Law, California Sky; and 187, Step Off. It's alternative stuff that generally sounds good when jamming around in an environment, and it's not bad. But honestly, I had to turn the music off while playing the first two levels, it just became too annoying. In short, TJ Lavin isn't a big disappointment. Our expectations were never that high for it to begin with. It's too bad that Lavin's game isn't as good as Dave Mirra's Freestyle BMX, though, because even that game has some problems that could been seen and adjusted. And since the competition should only go up from Dave Mirra, it doesn't look good for TJ Lavin and crew. TJ Lavin's Ultimate BMX needs serious work from top to bottom, but the central issue is that it never is much fun. I never had the deep feeling that I needed to play the next level to see what else I could do, and that's what a game like this absolutely, definitely needs. I would not buy this game.", "date": "May 1, 2001"}
