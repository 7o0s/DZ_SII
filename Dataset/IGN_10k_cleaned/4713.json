At the same time, SEGA Mobile quietly slipped a port of the original on carrier decks for handset users to enjoy.   Features:   Three tracks  High score board  Three musical tracks, including Splash Wave   Actually, OutRun for the handset comes across more as a port of the SEGA Master System version of the seminal racing game. This isn't exactly a knock against OutRun, as the SMS version was an excellent arcade port for such low-tech hardware. However, OutRun has been scaled back even further, cutting the number of course legs down to three.   But cellphone limitations are not what we should be judging here. What counts more is that OutRun gets the essence of the game right. It certainly starts off ont he right foot. As soon as you begin the game, you get to twist the radio dial and select a background tune. ~Magical Sound Shower~ and ~Splash Wave~ are our faves.   And then the race begins. The first leg is a decent approximation. The scenery is right -- complete with palms and beach houses, sweeping turns, and only a moderate amount of traffic. The second leg, depending on which way you go at the split, changes scenery just like the original.   So, SEGA Mobile managed to get the trimmings right -- what about the actual racing itself? Well, as expected, OutRun kinda hits the skids here. For one thing, the game control has been super-simplified. Your car is always accelerating. It's up to you to brake and turn, and balancing both to negotiate some of the sharper corners isn't exactly easy. Or fun, for that matter.   On Sprint PCS Vision phones, such as Sanyo 8100 we tested the game on, OutRun is only $1.99. Fans of Suzuki's classic racer may be able to justify hands over the two bucks for a quick-fix of OutRun, even with all of its control shortcomings. But for non-SEGAheads, OutRun is a tough game to recommend. Even if it does get the framework right -- the radio, the scenery -- that doesn't mean anything if you have zero connection to the franchise. It just means you can listen to a couple cool tunes while playing a grade-C racer.OutRun will be a disappointment for anybody that buys it as a racing game without any thought to the game's history. But if you're something of a SEGA junkie, like me, who remembers his mom bringing the SMS cart home from a clearance sale at Best, it's cool to have the game on yet another platform. Just don't kid yourself that you're playing a good racer.", "date": "May 25, 2004"}
