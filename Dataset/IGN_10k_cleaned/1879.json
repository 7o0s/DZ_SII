{"name": "DDR", "name_review": "Dance Dance Revolution", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/04/dance-dance-revolution-4", "text": "This is going to be a strange review to read.  It's certainly a strange one to write.  What is there left to say, really?  How much have I written about Dance Dance Revolution in the last two years?  Let's see...original impressions in my E3 '99 report, bunch of Usenet posts, 2nd Remix import review for GR, couple of online pieces on GRO, 3rd Mix preview, 4th Mix preview, Euro Mix news release, announcement for the US version, couple of preview updates there, some arcade stories from TGS 2000 and the fall 2000 AOU show, fifteen or so song-of-the-day puff pieces, competition reports, lord knows how many Q&A entries, and now this thing.  Have I written more about any other game?  Probably not.  On top of which, my feelings about Dance Dance are already clear, unless you've never read the site before today.  I love it, I think it's just about the best game to ever hit the arcades or a home system.  That's a fairly concrete opinion, there -- not much room to shade in the gray areas.  There are still a few things to say about the American version, so I suppose this won't be a complete rehash.  Still, it's weird to cap off my editorial involvement with a game I dearly love on such an oddly down note.  Gameplay  You do know how to play Dance Dance Revolution, yes?  If not, you haven't been paying much attention to me, have you?  So:  1. Arrows go up on screen.  2. Step on arrows on Power Pad-esque dance controller.  3. Bust funky dope maneuvers.  4. Sweat like maniac, grin like idiot.  This sounds simple.  It is simple.  It may also sound boring, or odd, or, as the cynics around here like to put it, ~fruity.~  You can judge that last one for yourself, I guess, but from my perspective the game is also an insane amount of fun, and there are a few million people out there who bought the many Japanese versions of the game to back me up.  Many frills and extra modes are naturally included to surround the basic gameplay concept.  The US version has a full complement up to the import 3rd Mix, meaning complete training, free play, and diet modes (where the game counts the calories you've burned by dancing), but not the Solo mode and the other extras that arrived with the recently-released 4th Mix.  There's no unlocking that I can perceive, though, no hidden songs like Bumble Bee and such.  Songs  All the songs you get, 28 of them, are available from the start in a 3rd Mix-style interface -- you don't have to work to open them progressively as in the original and 2nd Mix.  That's good.  However, the song lineup has its problems.  Chief among them is the absence of Butterfly, which is completely ridiculous.  If it isn't the most popular song out there, it's easily in the top five -- there's no reason at all that it should have been left out.  Someone, somewhere, at some division of Konami, has a very odd perception of the fanbase's tastes.  Same goes for the absence of Dam Dariram, voted most popular by an informal sample of our readers.  The Butterfly problem is pretty unequivocal.  Beyond that, you get into areas of musical taste, which are naturally minefields of argument -- I'm sure there are people out there who think three Paranoias, two Trip Machines, and Afronova actually isn't enough painfully hard music.  I rather think one of each would have been more than sufficient, though.  I'm also mystified as to why they included three NMR tracks, since 20,November is the only one of the lot that I wouldn't consider godawful easy-listening tripe, and I don't even like that one very much either.  But then there are all the people who think I'm a miserable philistine because I like Smoke, so what can you do?  The American song list does have a good breadth of genres: El Ritmo and La Senorita do the Latin thing, two versions of Put Your Faith In Me fill in the hip-hop corner, Dub I Dub and If You Were Here provide the chirpy Eurobeat, NMR and Olivia Newton-John satisfy the 50-and-over daytime FM radio demographic, and there's plenty of painfully hard techno to lay down a solid base.  This is a decent enough introduction to DDR music, but I can't help but think it could have been much better.  Graphics  Graphics?  What graphics?  I know no graphics.  Seriously, the visuals are not the point of this game.  It's nice to have the hallucinogenic goo oozing about the screen (much of it is very niftily designed, in fact) but what you'll really be paying attention to are the arrows and your own moves.  In this game, if you're good enough, you create the interesting visuals yourself -- first learn precision, and then gradually inject style into how you play.  Or you can be like me, and just sort of randomly flail about.  That's cool too, especially if you're from Idaho.  But the beauty of DDR is that it is indeed a dancing game, a blend of complex art and simple twitching.  If you write it off as Simon with your feet, you're missing the point and an awful lot of fun. Because DDR is an awful lot of fun, on balance perhaps the most awful lot of fun I've had with a video game.  I've introduced so many people to a great time with Dance Dance.  My sisters all liked it.  My mother thinks it's great.  Words cannot express the joy of being embraced by four cute fangirls at AWA 2000 just because I could get an A on Butterfly Upswing Mix.  I mean, this game is really, really cool.So despite my problems with the American song list, and I have some pretty frickin' big problems with it, I absolutely recommend this to American players.  Unless you've got a mod chip, in that case get the vastly superior Japanese 4th Mix, but all you good little domestic-playing boys and girls should run out to the nearest retailer, brave the horrors of Konami's bass-ackwards distribution, and dance like you want to win.  And maybe we'll get Butterfly next time...", "date": "Apr 4, 2001"}
