It only took them since the fall of 2000, seven years ago, to finally recognize the American demand for Sin & Punishment, and to finally do something about it. This critically acclaimed, import-only N64 shooter was praised upon release for its frenetic, high-energy action, addictive, arcade-like gameplay and mature, non-normal-Nintendo storyline. And it earned itself a fervent following that patiently awaited a localized release  but it never came. Even though the game seemed perfectly suited for store shelves in the States, and even though it already included English-language voice acting, it never came. It stayed in Japan.For seven years. But now, in an incredibly wise and likely profitable decision by NOA, the sins of the past are being repented for with this new, updated release of Sin & Punishment for the American Virtual Console. Updated, because this isn't exactly the same game that Japan first got back at the end of the N64 era  it's been retouched and enhanced with English-language menus, tutorials and in-game notices. It's been localized. And, as a result, waiting seven years just might have been worth it.Sin & Punishment is set in the world of the future  in the year 2007. Heh. And in this world of the future, mankind has come under assault from a race of genetically mutated animal insects called the Ruffians. The Ruffians are being opposed by the entire planet's military forces, but through a series of failed splicing experiments many of the soldiers and commanders who first fought against the mutants have become corrupted, and now side loyally with them. You, then, are a rebellious freedom fighter named Saki who's out to stop both the animal mutant alien insects and the mutant military insect animal commandoes. Or something like that. It's all very ridiculous to try to keep up with, because it's all very scattered and anime-inspired.As is, too, the gameplay. Sin & Punishment was published by Nintendo, but developed by Treasure  so it's packed to overflowing with that studio's signature style of constantly swarming crowds of enemies, endless amounts of ammunition and more simultaneous on-screen action than you could possible hope your brain to process all at once. And it's a blast. Each level of S&P is such a sensory overload that you won't quite care that you're missing minor details  you'll be too focused on frying everything in sight.With your gun, and with your sword. Saki wields both weapons as he runs constantly forward along an on-rails path, while you jump, double jump and roll to avoid obstacles and enemy attacks. The gun is your primary method of assault, as you can either guide its blasts around the screen freely or set it to lock-on to the nearest enemy threat. The sword is meant mostly for defense and deflection, as missiles that stray too near to you can be bounced back with a well-timed melee strike.The controls were complex to comprehend back on the N64, and the shift to the Virtual Console doesn't make it any more intuitive to pick up your pad and dive into the action  but with a little practice and patience, playing Sin & Punishment with the Wii Classic Controller works out just fine. You handle Saki's movement with the D-Pad, while simultaneously positioning your gun's aiming cursor with either the left or right Control Stick. Firing the gun and swinging the sword are mapped to the L Button, jumping's on R, and the A Button swaps you between free fire and lock-on cursor modes.It's confusing at first, but the game's tutorial mode (freshly translated into English for this VC version) introduces each function one at a time  and you'll quickly pick up the particulars with a playthrough of Easy Mode. That's the default difficulty setting, and it gives you the chance to blaze through the adventure without too much trouble. You may die a few times trying to figure out the tricks to certain bosses, or from running out of time, but those issues won't really be a problem for you until you dive straight into the much more intense challenge of Normal Mode, or the pull-your-hair-out madness of Turbo Hard.The only major complaint to lodge against this addictive, incomprehensible, anime action experience is that it's over in about the same amount of time as it would take to watch four episodes of your favorite Japanese cartoon. There are three distinct story arcs to the game's plot, and each plays quickly, and it's game over after the third is done. This could be encouraging for players who like to play their shooters over and over again in quick succession, trying to best their previous scores, but most gamers would likely prefer some more content here  even another small handful of levels would have helped the feel of the game's overall length considerably.Did you give in? Did you give up hope? Are you one of the loyal fans from seven years ago who got fed up with waiting and just bit the bullet, paying to import an actual N64 cartridge of the Japanese version of Sin & Punishment? If you did, and that's you, well  well done. We're not going to fault you for that, as you likely had a blast experiencing the game in its original edition. But for you, along with all the other gamers who've never yet experienced S&P, we're still going to recommend an immediate download. Invest 1200 Wii Points here, and do it quickly.Because Sin & Punishment is an N64 masterpiece, the hardware swansong that Americans never got to hear. And because here on the Virtual Console it looks better and is more accessible than ever before  its newly translated menus and training modes are the first sign of Nintendo taking the time to make a positive revision to an existing retro title before making it available in the Wii Shop, and that it's even been made available at all speaks volumes for the potential of countless other games in the Big N's back catalog that never got the chance to come to the States. Download Sin & Punishment not just because you'll be getting an outstanding game, but also because you'll be voicing your support for the addition of more import titles to the Virtual Console in the future. Nintendo's made a wise decision in offering this product to American gamers, finally, after such a long time. Let's just hope they keep it up, and that we don't have to wait for the next major import release for another seven years.", "date": "Oct 2, 2007"}
