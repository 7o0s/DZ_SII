However you try to describe the strange Capcom fighter known as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, one thing is for sure... you'll never find anything else quite like it.   Based on the equally unique Manga and Anime series of the same name, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure follows the exploits of the Joestar family. The Joestars (and their companions) have found themselves on a perilous quest to abolish the servants of an evil vampire -- and the monster himself. The one-of-a-kind anime is widely known for its influence and creativity, and it's certainly no stretch of the imagination to say that the game mirrors its source material perfectly.   I'll admit from the start, that JoJo is in not on the same level as Capcom's other 2D fighters. The Street Fighter series and its cousins, the Alpha games, are deeper and more involving exercises in combo-crunching. However, what this Bizarre Adventure lacks in character count and its number of moves, it makes up for in personality ten-fold. From the moment you boot up your Dreamcast and the opening cinema begins, the distinct world of JoJo will envelop your brain. Flashing various shots of characters you thought you'd never see, I defy you to not want to play it at least once. From Iggy the Dog to Chaca the Swordsman, you have never seen a fighter like this.    As mentioned in my preview of the Japanese version, JoJo is not a character, rather a conglomeration of many of the lead players all rolled into one. Jotaro Kujo, Josuke Higashikata, Joseph Joestar and several supporting characters all share that common thread in their names. While some might find this confusing, I thought it was an interesting way for coming up with a title. With that out of the way, on to the good part, the game itself!   The disc is broken up into two parts; The first game (JoJo's Venture) and the second installment (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure). Both titles are essentially the same thing with a few minor differences. If you're like me, most of you will probably spend your precious playing time with the second game, as not only are there almost twice as many characters to choose from, but the endings and storylines are identical to the first. Still, for completists, the ability to choose your poison is a nice bonus.   Also cool is the ability to partake in either a challenge or story mode. While challenge is straightforward fighting, story mode is where it's really at. Based on the third episode of the anime series, the hunt to destroy supernatural bloodsucker Dio Brando is entertainment incarnate. Definitely one of the best solo player fighting experiences out there, braving the game alone is just as (if not more) fun than butting heads with a friend.   The control is laid out in an interesting variation of the popular Capcom setup. There are still six buttons to beat the hell out of but not like you're used too. The top set are the common ~Light~, ~Medium~, and ~Hard~ attacks, but are no longer separated into punches or kicks. Instead, each button could be either an attack with the fist, foot, sword, garbage truck, or whatever else a character can hit you with. In this particular layout, each strike is unique to the combatant you're using.   The bottom set of buttons are the extra ~fun~ keys; with ~Stand~, ~Taunt~, and ~Evade~. Taunt and Evade is pretty self-explanatory, as pressing those buttons lets you make fun of your opponent or slide right through an attack untouched. The command that really makes the game, however, is the Stand function. With it, you may summon a representation of your fighter's psyche and use it to the best of your advantage.   Mimicking whatever the main character does and then some, Stands are the stars of the show. Brandishing some of the best hand-drawn art this side of a console, each alter-ego pulls off its specials with style. With weapons, explosions, and body parts going everywhere, Stands are a marvel to watch with each one stranger than the last. True, they aren't as effective as a tag-team partner would be (re: Marvel vs. Capcom), but they get the job done nonetheless.The best way to describe JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is that it's a strange and entertaining jaunt into the realm of fighting. If an attempt at something different while keeping the true spirit of Capcom fighting is what you're looking for then JoJo is for you. Have fun!", "date": "May 3, 2000"}
