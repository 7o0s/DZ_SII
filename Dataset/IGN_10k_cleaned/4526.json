How do you review a shooter with no actual shooting?  Features:  Pilot a Mobile Suit Sword-swinin' shooter action Cutscenes  Gundam Atlantic Battle is a side-scrolling shooter, but without the gunplay. Instead, your Gundam Mobile Suit is outfitted only with a Beam Sword and Hyper Hammer to repel enemy robot. And there is certainly no shortage of enemy robots to trash in Gundam Atlantic Battle.  Stripping the shooting turns Gundam Atlantic Battle into more of a metallic Final Fight where the screen keeps on chugging by. You must deftly weave between robots, swiping them with your huge sword. Of course, they can shoot at you, but if you're fast, you can easily outrun their beams. And should the going get tough, you can always bust out the Hyper Hammer to quickly turn the tide if only temporarily. After a moment to catch your breath, the screen is quickly repopulated with robots.  Gundam Atlantic Battle is actually a pretty decent little action game, something you don't find too often on older Sprint PCS Vision-enabled phones, such as the Samsung N400. Naturally, the older gear limits the size of the playing field and the amount of sound, but for gamers that have not upgraded their handsets within the last year, Bandia's little non-shooter is a decent download.  The sprites are pretty well done, considering how little real estate they take up on-screen. There is no mistaking that classic Gundam look. The backgrounds are somewhat plain, but considering the setting -- the Atlantic Ocean -- we suppose that endless waves of blue are to be expected. Gundam Atlantic Battle is certainly not going to blow the hair back of people playing with Nokia's 3650, but for early PCS adopters, this game is a nice reward (or reprieve) after slogging your way through a ton of questionable titles. With non-stop action and a well-represented license, we can't help recommend Gundam Atlantic Battle to Sprint gamers.", "date": "Mar 7, 2004"}
