Unfortunately, when it hit this side of the world, THQ had yanked the most important feature out of the game: battery save. It was a racing game that focused on vehicle collection, and to replace the convenient battery with a horrendous password to ~record~ gamers' progress is to make the game more work to play that what's acceptable.  Why start a review off talking about another racing game? Simple: Hot Wheels: Burning Rubber is, essentially, THQ's ~apology~ for what it did with GT Advance. Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber is, at its core, GT Advance with Hot Wheels vehicles instead of licensed automobiles, and fantasy locations instead of real-world tracks. And yep, the whole car collection aspect is intact as well...and what's more, the game features a battery to save your earned vehicles during play. Don't let the ~young~ theme sway you away from this game...those who loved the actual gameplay of GT Advance will find the exact same feel in Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber... with a bit more added to the mix. Features 16 tracks 25 vehicles to collect Link cable support for two players (multi-cartridge) Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  Sixteen tracks and 25 different vehicles await racers, with five computer controlled opponents as the competitors. As you progress through the game's championship modes, you'll earn additional vehicles if you beat the best recorded time on each track. But unlike GT Advance, in Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber, the better you do, the more money you earn after a race...which can then be converted into improved attributes for your vehicles. You'll need 'em because you'll never beat the computer opponents without increasing your car's speed, handling and acceleration.  Because these are teeny tiny Hot Wheels cars, tracks scurry across ~miniworld~ style environments...like a grand piano or a pool table. The game engine is a bit limited in how well it can accurately represent the area, since it's still using the Mode 7-style graphics techniques for the road...the pool table, for example, has cue sticks to leap over, but they're drawn as assumed, flat, 2D cue sticks. But the game's speed never drops out of its super smooth framerate...another benefit of using an excellent, existing engine for the game.  Even though the game features the same excellent, tight power-sliding control and handling gameplay of GT Advance, Hot Wheels isn't a cut-and-dry port of the GT Advance engine. Tracks can now have ~hidden~ shortcuts to utilize...they're not exactly hiding, though, since a giant, flashing exclamation point lets you know when one's approaching on the right or left. Tracks can also have rudimentary jumps...they're nothing really special, but at least your car can now take some air during a race.  And thanks to the GT Advance engine, Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber features two system linkcable play using two cartridges. Like GT Advance, this mode isn't as elaborate as link cable support in other racers like Mario Kart: Super Circuit, but some is better than none. My only real gripe about this game is its more sloppy interface...THQ is targeting a younger audience for Hot Wheels: Burnin' Rubber, but the menus aren't as neatly laid-out or designed as they were in the ~older~ racer the company released back in June 2001. But other than that little issue, this game is extremely inviting for racing fans, despite the license and younger feel...and it's worth a look if you felt cheated buying the US version of GT Advance.", "date": "Feb 7, 2002"}
