The game captivated audiences with its vision of medieval castle sieges and heated clan warfare. Fans piled into family owned gaming arcades to challenge their electronic enemies to blood feuds, eventually filling the company's belly with over four million online subscriptions. That's a lot of scrilla.   What's causing all these people to empty their bank accounts? The answer to that question is not simple. A number of factors go into locking pupils to irradiating cathode-ray tubes for hours and hours, causing massive caffeine intake and severe tooth decay. Fluid gameplay, attractive presentation, and solid technical support can all contribute to the success of an online game. The game's designers accomplished these to differing degrees of success, but Lineage has one more trait that keeps shoveling coal onto its fire: community.  I'll start with gameplay.  Players task themselves, initially, with the acquisition of experience and items. Newbies discover a temperate land populated with numerous online gamers and scarce monsters. This game is for the patient at heart, as monsters respawn at slow speeds and competition with other players leaves you walking for miles to find the next orc to waste. Granted, at higher levels, the number of players per tile of e-space decreases significantly; early on, you'll often wonder, where are all the monsters? This is not a monster crawl like Diablo 2. Character leveling is slow.   In this respect, NCsoft is going to have difficulty selling the game to American gamers. Americans are renowned for having attention spans reminiscent of the half-life of a tau lepton -- thirty million millionths of a second! Now THAT'S short! Well, that is an exaggeration. Even so, taking five minutes to find a fresh batch of baddies to beat on can wear on one's patience.  Characters are limited to a walking speed similar to the moseying of window shoppers without agendas. This can be especially annoying in the early stages of the game, when you are attempting to crack a skull and your adversary simply walks out of range. Fortunately, the designers set up a teleporting system that speeds the movement of characters between the regions of the game. Also, not having the ability to run from an opponent that gains the advantage in a melee is sorely needed in Lineage (eventually characters can use magic to escape from danger, but I'm talking about a universal skill). Running may seem like cowardice, but it is a sound strategy when you are facing death.  The interface of Lineage is fairly straightforward. Commands are executed through the mouse and assigned hotkeys. Since the game is online and changes as NCsoft alters the game's code, the game does not have a hard, set in stone manual. Instead, players can access an in-game help function, log onto the game's official website, or ask fellow players for hints to uncover the subtleties of the game. An example of how I used this redundant system to figure out how players were arming themselves with canine companions, I first examined the issue in the game's help index. The help function listed the different commands that can be used on pets, but not how to obtain a dog. After that, I asked players in my game vicinity. They informed me to beat a mutt until it was ready to die (a trial and error process as the game does not list a creature's vitality) and then feed it some scrumptious treats. Some players suggested I should avoid the tedium of taming a wild creature and seek out a merchant player that dealt in the pet trade. Instead of trading my time for a pooch, I could trade my money for one. Accessing the official website supported the claims of the online community and added the information that a lone NPC offered dogs in his store. My question answered, I set about gaming. All I needed to do was ask and look in the right places and my questions were answered.   Lineage's Bloodpledge, a system of clan warfare, presents the game's greatest feature. Led by a Prince or Princess, players can unite under one flag and attempt to take control of one of the castles scattered across the lands of Aden. A Bloodpledge's size is dependent upon the leader's charisma and can be composed of players and NPC mercenaries. Clan warfare is an extremely addicting feature of any game. After joining a clan, players develop a pride and loyalty that is unique to the multiplaying world. Until now, online games had not been designed to wholly incorporate players' actions into the over-arcing story of the game. In Lineage, players can assume the role of hero or villain and their exploits can live on in the legends and curses of thousands of gamers. The potential for ego boosting and bashing, epic clan feuds, and history-making battles is so great for Lineage that it is hard to imagine the game not impressing American gamers.  Now for the game's problem: presentation.  Lineage: the Blood Pledge is played out in a two dimensional isometric world -- think Baldur's Gate. The pre-rendered backgrounds range from low-grade to finely crafted, dependent upon the release date of the game's region -- the sooner the better. The mood set by the art is one of a fantastic medieval world. The castles are cool looking and the architecture suggests a sophisticated, yet mildly conservative, imagination.  Character animation is less than desirable. Limited to four classes, the sprites lack any significant modularity. Place a bow in your hero's hands and he's shown holding a bow, but place a shield on his arm and his model does not change. Considering RPGs have incorporated this in their designs over the past couple of years, you get the feeling that NCsoft utilized a devolving strategy when creating Lineage.  Animations become extremely choppy when coupled with a character's movements. Take a step in any direction and you are presented with a frame rate less than ten frames per second (10 fps). Couple that with a mildly high ping rate (the amount of time needed for your computer to send a message to the host server and receive a reply) and you are faced with an unpleasant picture of the game's combat. A Monster dies in three frame animations and sometimes more than once -- lag hooray!  Lighting in the game is reduced to rudimentary light sources and does not include dynamic shadows or reflections. Characters and certain monsters light the ground around them similar to the lighting in Diablo -- a four year old game. Again, the game fails to utilize modern graphics technology.  But, there is light at the end of the dark tunnel. NCsoft is aware of the shortcomings of the game's graphics and is working to enrich them. Already, there is a palpable feeling of graphical improvements -- at least in terms of backgrounds -- as you progress through the game's areas. As new regions are released, the designers increase the fidelity of the world. And, are considering a patch that would retroactively improve the graphics of the game's earlier segments. But, these changes are in the works, not yet ready for the public. As it stands, the game's graphics are archaic and it is going to be a difficult sell to gamers that are used to 21st century graphics.  Sound is virtually non-existent in Lineage: the Blood Pledge. Aside from a soundtrack that must have been created by a Casio keyboard, the game's action and spell sounds cause a numbing feeling in one's ears. There are no digitized voices in the game, be it plot thickening diatribes or character quips. Sound is an integral dimension in a game's design and NCsoft has a challenge ahead of it if it wishes to improve it -- the battle should be easy, as the sound can only get better.   Well that's about it as far as the game's graphics and sound go. The game can only get better, as its designers create new media and update the code.  Seeing as that NCsoft needs subscriptions to pay its bills, it is no wonder that the company boasts a fairly solid server framework. Keeping a game world up and running on the World Wide Web is not an entirely easy feat. ISP problems, server hardware problems, and general acts of God can all disrupt a gamer's online experience. While playing on Ken Rauhel earlier this month, I experienced network disconnects on a handful of occasions. But, in every case, the server was back up and running within a couple of minutes. While playing Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction on Blizzard's Battle.net, I frequently experienced server blackouts that lasted hours at a time -- and that from a network hosting a fraction of the number of concurrent users! NCsoft discovered cause of the disconnects and replaced some faulty hardware in rapid order. That kind of quick trouble fixing is great when you are paying for the gaming by the month.  Finally, I'd like to talk about the community of gamers that currently populate the cyberscape of Lineage: the Blood Pledge. Players seemed genuinely interested in communing with others -- they would answer questions to the best of their abilities, join a party (for the most part) when queried, and often come to the rescue of a fellow player that was facing death in a soured melee. Since your characters are limited to the server on which you created them, you are often playing with the same gamers from day to day. This is an excellent way to meet online buddies and possibly even create a Bloodpledge that lasts for months.   Of course, there are villains in the game and can be found on both player versus player (PVP) and non-PVP servers. Evil characters gain brownie points by beating on good characters -- both NPCs and PCs -- and friendly creatures. It is telling of Lineage's online community that the number of evil players is less than the number of good. People seem to be watching out for one another and acting with chivalry -- something I'm sure Lord British is proud of.  Speaking of Lord British, the legendary game designer, will be leading a promotional siege next week. Gamers wishing to see the Lord in action and participate in a little video gaming history, should either download the game (and subscribe for $15 a month or $45 for four months) or head out to Electronics Boutique and get a fifteen-day trial for $3. But you'd better hurry, as you want to be sure that you are high enough level to join in on the siege.  The game does demand a pretty hefty bandwidth -- not actually for gameplay, but the downloading of patches. People with 56K connections will certainly be spending lots of time downloading the game's revisions.  NCsoft came up with a heck of a design in Lineage: the Blood Pledge. The game feeds off the collective energies of hordes of competitive gamers and supplies a solid framework for clan competition. It is a game for those of us that enjoy hard won victories and difficult defeats. If you've got the gut for the blood feuds and the time to nurture your heroes in a lively online community, this game is for you.  However, the game does lack on the sensual side of video gaming. The animations are simple and the game's choppy movement really calls out for improvement. The game's sound is low quality -- at least you don't need a bitchin' sound card to enjoy the game! But Lineage does not offer much for gaming audiophiles. If you are a gamer that coos to the presentation of heavy-duty graphics and Pro-Logic sound, you're going to be unimpressed with the game.  -- Mike Murphy Want to share your opinions with the world?
