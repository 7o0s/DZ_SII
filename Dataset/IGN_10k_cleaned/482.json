{"name": "Panzer Elite", "name_review": "Panzer Elite", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/03/panzer-elite", "text": "Wings Simulations in Germany developed this game and according to their estimation, it recreates tank warfare ~more accurately than any other tank simulation to date.~ The only way to defend that assertion is to state that since driving real tanks is hard as hell, the game should be hard as hell to play. I don't buy that, unfortunately. Obviously we want realism in our sims but not at the cost of enjoyment or approachability. But that's the hole into which Panzer Elite has fallen. It is realistic -- no one can dispute that. From the tank models to the scenario design, everything about this game screams authenticity. But the control interface and the inconsistent graphics suggest that Wings Simulation might be better suited to writing a reference book on tank warfare than developing a PC sim.  In an effort to be fair about it, let's talk about what Panzer Elite does right. First, the 22 tank models are really well done. Any system that's on the real tank is on the tanks in the game. Then there are the 80-plus support vehicles from half-tracks to infantry to artillery. These are just as well designed as the tanks themselves. The environments are also spectacular, if only from a design standpoint. The inclusion of individual trees, rivers and small villages makes the game world seem particularly credible.  Sadly, the successes of the graphic concept aren't supported by the execution. The visuals in the game are disappointing. The tank models are distinctive enough but exhibit frequent clipping problems, especially as regards the treads. These are constantly rising from and falling into the surface of the ground. Add to that the fact that the tanks have a very cardboard cutout look to them and you have more that enough reasons to question the need for your 3D card. The environment looks pretty poor as well. Trees and bushes seem flat and one-dimensional and when run over, they simply fall flat on the ground.  But wait -- I was supposed to be saying good things, wasn't I? Let's see...the scenarios are well designed. There are over 80 scenarios spread across three theaters of war -- North Africa, Italy and Normandy. Plans are underway for expansions that cover the Ardennes or the Russian front. All the scenarios are based on actual tank battles from the war and offer several types of tasks. You may be called upon to scout a location, protect a convoy or defend a village. Or you may be asked to kick the crap out of the enemy. The game is further supported by campaigns in each of the three theaters. The campaigns will call upon you to manage the resources of your platoon as you progress through the war.  For those who are wondering where all this realism and attention to detail comes from, remember that the developers are German and therefore are sticklers for realism. The developers have also obtained access to the Panzer Museum in Munster -- another perk of living in Germany. All of the tanks have been designed using the actual blueprints and manuals as a starting point. I will say that the tanks seems to handle differently, but not remarkably so. The developers have also spent a lot of time interviewing former panzer commanders in an effort to add authenticity.  That about covers it for the good news. Once you begin to consider how the game plays, the whole edifice begins to crumble. The control interface is awkward enough to prompt the question, ~Did any of the guys making this game actually bother to play it?~ While I have no doubt that hardcore sim freaks will flock to this title, I can't see too many people getting into it. The game is a challenge to play simply because of the interface. Forget AI, forget the challenges of armor tactics, this game is difficult solely on account of the control system.  The ~Tank Mouse~ takes the form of a little graphic display in the upper left corner of the screen. It's a top-down view of your tank with all sorts of icons and buttons on and around it. It was included for the ~casual player~ but I've got no idea how the guys at Wings Simulations decided that this method of control was easier than using the keyboard. I will admit that almost all of the primary tank controls are accessible from the Tank Mouse, but they're twice as hard to use than the keyboard shortcuts. There are no less than 15 separate functions incorporated into the Tank Mouse, but most of them are grouped so closely together that accessing them becomes very problematic. Within fifteen minutes of trying to use the Tank Mouse, I completely gave up and reached for my joystick.  Things weren't much better here. It would make sense to me to have the joystick control the speed and direction of the tank while the hat switch controls turret elevation and rotation. But that's not the case here. The whole thing is so ill conceived that I soon gave up on it too.  By the end, I grew to appreciate the ~simplicity~ of the keyboard controls. It should be said that the keyboard interface is simple only in comparison to the Tank Mouse and joystick controls. The biggest problem in regard to the keyboard controls is that there are so damn many of them. I frequently found myself accidentally shutting off my engine when trying to change my platoon formation. To the game's credit, I should mention that many of the gunnery functions can be relegated to you gunner. He'll take care of aiming and firing the main gun, so you can concentrate on not turning off your engines.  All the while, you'll have to be mindful of the camera controls. Once again, it winds up being an exercise in annoyance. The implementation of camera views has been handled very poorly here. By far the most useful of the views is an exterior panning shot, but it seems to pivot around the tank in a funny manner...and I don't mean funny ha-ha. The up and down movement of the camera seems to pivot along a very unstable axis. Things are only slightly better for the sideways movement of the camera. My biggest problem is that the camera pivots around a space a few feet behind the tank. It is therefore impossible to see what's going on directly behind you without losing sight of the area directly in front of your tank. Maybe if I could have found a zoom command, it might have been better. And don't even get me started on the wingman commands.  One cool feature in the view set is the option to enter any of the five crew locations for the tank and view the action from a true first-person perspective. I now have a greater appreciation of how hard it must have been for these guys to see anything. The commander is able to get a good view out of the hatch, but all of the other crew member views are so constricted that it's no small wonder that I wasn't constantly running over cows and trees. But it is supremely realistic to say the least.  There's a bit more to the game than what I've outlined above, but it's just too hard to control to get any real enjoyment out of it. In their effort to build a first-rate Panzer simulation, Wings Simulations has apparently forgotten that this product is a game. That's not to criticize or cheapen the role of games -- after all, I love games, even if I am forced to play them day after day for money. But a 100 percent realistic simulation is about the last thing most of us want. We want a game to be realistic only to the point that it stops being fun. Well, most of us want that at least. But a game should challenge you in the area of strategy and tactics, not in terms of the control scheme.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Dec 3, 1999"}
