If you've played Boulder Dash, the classic spelunking game that has popped up from time to time since the heady Commodore 64 era, you will be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Gameloft's spiritual successor. However, Gameloft's uses its artistic wizardry to give the formula its best look yet, and the addition of items and boss battles adds a series of wrinkles that could help ensnare players that claim they've played enough Boulder Dash to last a lifetime.   You are an intrepid explorer, pressing deep into the jungles of Angkor Wat, the dungeons of Bavaria, and the icy Tibetan caves. You must collect a series of gems before heading for an exit that leads to the next room on each world's snaking area map. At the end of each map, you must defeat a boss monster to escape for the next treacherous locale. Instead of burrowing through dirt, you must cut through leaves, break industrial-strength cobwebs, and break stones to find the precious jewels. However, as expected, gravity takes hold of precariously balanced boulders and sends them toppling down to smash any slow-moving creatures -- yourself included.   Diamond Rush is actually more of a puzzler than the original Boulder Dash. Most rooms are set up like clockwork devices. You must plot your course to minimize risk against cascading boulders, but maximize the number of gems you pluck from the ruins. Sometimes, you can even ~paint~ yourself into a corner, leaving yourself no way out of a room, save for suicide. Should you need to off yourself, you re-spawn at the most recent checkpoint. These checkpoints become rarer and rarer as you move through the game. By the time you reach Tibet, self-immolation can set you back several minutes of play. This is sometimes fun -- but it's also borderline frustrating. Challenge is always good, but setting up a wicked puzzle with only one solution is almost mean. Especially when you're just trying to enjoy a three-minute break from real life.   Your explorer will find items in chests such as a compass and hammers that help you reach the goals and defeat enemy monsters. Environmental hazards, like fire traps and giant spears, will also try to claim your life. These extras do help boost Diamond Rush out of the realm of the familiar, and I was happy to see them present.   Diamond Rush is certainly a lengthy game -- gamers that dig this kind of play will find a lot of value from Gameloft's puzzle adventure. There are forty levels stretched out across the three worlds. it will take you many hours to see the entirety of the game, although a good percentage of that time will be attributed to replaying segments that claimed a life (or five) due to the treachery and trickiness.   The game looks fantastic. I've seen it running on a handful of phones, including LGs and Sony Ericssons. The color work is fantastic. Animations are excellent, with some great attention paid to small details, like the wiggle of your explorer as he fishes an item out of a chest.  Diamond Rush may be a familiar play to puzzle fans -- Boulder Dash has been around for some time -- but the presentation and extras found in Gameloft's rendition push it above the game that obviously inspired it. I think the game is sometimes a little too merciless, and at times felt like I was just pushing through a level because I wanted to see what was next for the sake of this review, not because I was necessarily enjoying myself. If you're tired of Boulder Dash, move on -- but if you still enjoy the category, give this one a peek-see.", "date": "Jan 3, 2007"}
