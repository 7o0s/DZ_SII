Developed by Idol Minds this time around (and not UEP Systems, responsible for the first two) the game brings not only a brand-new 3D engine to the fray, but the unexpected ability to fist-fight while boarding as well.  At its core, Cool Boarders 3 remains true to its predecessors, delivering a variety of downhill runs and half-pipe stunt courses. This time, however, there are far more locales to choose from and more than enough alpine surfers to control. 13 characters are initially selectable (more are unlocked as your skill increases) along with 11 initial boards. Several different mountains are there to be conquered, located in regions from North America to Japan.  Competition is the name of the game. Events include Boarder X, Slalom, Half Pipe, Big Air, and Slope Style. Tricks are the driving force behind it all, and there are plenty of those too. Gameplay modes include single event, tournament, practice (very helpful), and split-screen two-player competition.   So is it king of the hill, or better suited to the green circle runs?I'll be blunt. Snowboarding games have never really gotten me fired up, so it takes a really good one to make me sit up and take notice. Unfortunately, the latest Cool Boarders did anything but.While the game certainly has things dialed in on the technical front, it did absolutely nothing for me gameplay-wise. Granted, there are plenty of courses and boarders compared to the past titles, but it's stale as a year-old loaf of banana bread in execution.In a nutshell: there's absolutely nothing here you haven't seen before. Unless you absolutely, positively must have the newest snowboarding game around, I'd recommend passing.", "date": "Oct 31, 1998"}
