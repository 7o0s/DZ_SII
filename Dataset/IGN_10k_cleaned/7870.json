It cannot be helped. Just roll with it, because the sooner you get it into your head that Hands On Mobile's Duckshot is some sort of spiritual successor, the sooner you can force it out and ease into a surprisingly enjoyable little shooting game.   Duckshot presents you with a seemingly endless supply of feathered targets. Armed with a shotgun and a finite supply of shells, you head out into a variety of picturesque locations to blast them out of the sky. To move from one location to the next, you must spell out the word QUACK. Each letter is awarded for shooting three or more of the same duck with a single pull of the trigger.   Your target cursor offers a wide spread, but you can only shoot one type of duck at a time. Multiples may fly into range, but unless they are of the same line, bulls-eyes only appear over the center duck. You earn higher bonuses for nailing as many of the same duck as possible -- the highest I got was a sextet. As you push farther into the wilderness, you encounter swans with greater frequency. You cannot pull the trigger when these graceful creatures fly into range. Swans love to ruin a big score, so you must keep your cursor moving so you can keep an eye out for combos.    In many ways, Duckshot is not entirely unlike a puzzle game. You must balance available points with the possibility of bigger scores by choosing your targets smartly and carefully. Plus, there is an element of luck, because what looks like an easy triple can suddenly become a five-shot if you hesitate just an extra second before firing and the gamble pays out. But then you run the risk getting a swan, which defeats the sure-thing triple you could have taken. And lest I forget, always be on the lookout for the Golden Snipe -- a sky-clearing bonus.   When you've spent your shells, you head to a stamp collections screen. If you beat your previous high score, you earn another duck stamp for a booklet.  I like this system a lot, because stamps are not assigned arbitrarily to some high score of the developer's liking. You're just trying to best yourself to earn more stamps and see more locations. At any time, you can view your stamp collection.   Now, with a fairly limited scope, does Duckshot ever get boring? Only after playing it for some time and going on some pretty big scoring tears. If you hit a particularly high score, it can get frustrating when -- for the next five games -- you never seen to catch a break and come remotely close. But when you start nailing fives and sixes on a regular basis, Duckshot is good fun.  Duckshot is one of those pleasant little surprises -- once you get over the inevitable Duck Hunt comparisons. They aren't the same game, and in some respects, Duckshot may be better because the elements of chance and strategy really goose the title with replayability. I don't think Duckshot is for everybody, but if a harmless hunting game with puzzle mechanics intrigues you, give it a chance.", "date": "Dec 22, 2006"}
