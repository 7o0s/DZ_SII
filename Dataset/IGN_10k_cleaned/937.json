{"name": "Safecracker", "name_review": "Safecracker", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/11/safecracker", "text": "Many gamers think that Mortyr, which turned out to be a half-assed tribute to the third reich, went through hell trying to reach North America.  When it comes to overseas imports, however, I doubt they're quite so aware that Safecracker's journey to the good old US of A makes Elian Gonzalez's nautical voyage look like an episode of The Love Boat.  Originally destined to arrive in '96 as part of GT Interactive's lineup, the title never made it into stores for some unknown reason.  Eventually the rights to the game were either repurchased by, or defaulted back to, Daydream Software, the Swedish development house who put this bad boy together.  To make a long story short, whatever happened in the four years following, the title is just now surfacing in stores under Dreamcatcher Interactive's banner.   If the story behind Safecracker's arrival is a real tearjerker, the plot behind the game itself isn't quite so eloquent.  According to the comic strip introduction found in the manual, the main character is an elite security systems expert looking for a new gig.  Having applied to Crabb & Sons, the most prestigious manufacturer of safes and security systems in the world, our main man has been granted an audience with the company's grand poobah, Mr. Crabb.  Despite being an eccentric old fart, Crabb seems pretty hip, because he doesn't demand a drug test or anything.  But there is that little matter of having to break into his headquarters and crack the code on an assload of safes before he'll add anyone to the payroll.  Guess he's not a believer in the public education system.  Screw it though, because it's your job to school this guy like the feisty little whippersnapper you are.  Bumbling through Crabb's multimedia mansion of Macromedia developed delights (try saying that five times fast), you'll have to explore dozens of rooms, uncover hidden secrets, and solve the kind of annoyingly difficult brain-teasers that would cause Sherlock Holmes to have a nervous breakdown.  Alright, maybe Safecracker's not all THAT bad, but it's the kind of hardcore adventure game that's meant for anally retentive sleuths, die-hard codebreakers, and anyone but casual audiences.  From the moment the game starts, leaving players stuck out on the street with only their wits to use in order to gain entry to Crabb's padlocked funhouse, it's an uphill climb.    Upon entering the mansion, you're given free reign to roam about and explore a series of rooms while you hope to randomly stumble upon a revelation as to what to do next. Safecracker is one of those titles that tosses the player into the midst of a scenario with no indication whatsoever of how to get out of the pickle they're in.  All you'll really be aware of while moving from room to room is a sense of time slowly ticking away, which it is in fact, since you're only given 12 hours to accomplish your goal.  Nevertheless, having to navigate in psuedo 3D through the maze of corridors using a mouse driven interface with only brainpower and a compass to guide you is just part of the challenge.  The main problem is that clues aren't so much found as stumbled upon.  Though many of the safes encountered can be cracked by solving simple combination based puzzles, such as turning dials or hitting buttons in the proper sequence, others require keen insight on the player's part.  Having to slide jumbled tiles into a complete picture or find a password that's been hidden in a cupboard isn't so tough.  But I can't honestly say that the need to flip through random catalogs, books, and circuit diagrams scattered about on coffee tables throughout the mansion looking for descriptions of safe architecture, ciphers with which to decrypt codes, and other tidbits of useful information is within the bounds of reason.  Because you're given no directions on how to proceed and aren't confined to specific areas of the mansion, those without a keen sense of perception are doomed to wander endlessly in search of answers.    Or they can just explore every little nook and cranny ad infinitum, which seems to be the designers' plan.  For all intents and purposes, it's what most people are going to have to do anyway, simply to determine which items (including those found in their inventory) actually have a use in the game.  Though I'll be the first to admit that a rather large quantity of the puzzles to be found in Safecracker are nothing short of ingenious, a great majority of these conundrums are made unecessarily difficult due to a nonexistant system of progression.  Left with no helping hand to guide them (or at least no immediately visible one) on how to defeat locks based on temperature conversions, radio freqeuncies, and the braille alphabet, casual gamers will find themselves more clueless than Alicia Silverstone.  Heck, they may even find themselves homicidal after being subjected to the game's techno crud soundtrack.  After an instinctive lunge puts an end to the mangled noises coming out of the speakers, however, it's possible to view your pleasantly rendered surroundings in peace.  Although the visuals were created several years ago and are beginning to show signs of age, they're one of the game's strong points, serving to liven up play a bit by portraying in vivid detail the poshly decorated lounges, technical design areas, and showrooms which reside in Crabb's manor.  And though the surroundings are by no means cutting edge, they offer enough little surprises to hold the player's interest and keep things fresh.   Who'd have thought a dog figurine which makes pig noises when clicked upon or a computer that offers up a playable version of minesweeper could have done so much to spruce up an otherwise generic adventure game?  Taking into the account the frequency with which this title commits crimes against both the brain and the family jewels, a more apt title might have been 'Nutcracker.'  One of the hardest adventure titles I've ever seen, Nut, er...Safecracker is a challenge worthy of the most demanding gamer.  To the rest of us, it's just another outdated budget title that's more trouble than it's worth.  In the immortal words of my girlfriend, ~can't you tell them to stop sending you this sh*t and get something like Myst instead?~  Amen, baby, amen.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "May 11, 2000"}
