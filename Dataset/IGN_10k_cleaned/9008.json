The TurboGrafx needed a blockbuster action/adventure game, the NES had one, and Hudson copied it. Neutopia is one of the most shameless Legend of Zelda clones ever created, from the birds-eye perspective, to the basic item-based gameplay, to the overall structure of overworld and underground labyrinth exploration and more. It's a copy of Zelda  but at least it's a good one.   The similarity starts in its story. In The Legend of Zelda, the fresh-faced hero Link stepped forward to save the kingdom of Hyrule from the villainous Ganon, by retrieving the eight pieces of the Triforce from eight underworld mazes and ultimately saving the Princess Zelda. In Neutopia, the fresh-faced hero Jazeta steps forward to save the kingdom of Neutopia from the villainous Dirth, by retrieving the eight magic medallions from eight underworld mazes and ultimately saving the Princess Aurora.   So the plotline's all very familiar, and the familiarity continues into the gameplay  right down to the stiff, four-way-only directional movement and the straightforward strikes with your sword. And you talk to non-player characters hiding in overworld caves. And you use bombs to blow holes in labyrinth walls. And you push rocks to reveal hidden staircases. But listing all of the continuing commonalities between Neutopia and Zelda 1 would take the entire remainder of the review, so take it as truth that pretty much any element contained in Link's first ever adventure is mirrored here. And so we'll focus on what's different, like the Fire Rod.     Easily obtained shortly into the adventure, the Rod is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded. It's an item that projects forth magic fireballs, the power of each is determined by your level of remaining health. If you're low on energy, you'll get weak, short-range shots. But if you're fully vitalized, you'll unleash massive columns of running flame. The Rod is essential for interacting with elements in the environment  as are other items you later gain  as well as for attacking enemies.   If you can hit them. One thing Neutopia doesn't share with Nintendo's NES epic is its collision detection, which can be spotty and frustrating here from time to time. Jazeta's vertical attacks, in particular, can be hard to place  while determining the distance for striking foes from side to side is easier, the contact boundary above his head is more nebulous to manage. The judgment difficulty can lead to unnecessary damage done to your hero, which is annoying since then your Rod's power will decrease. And, if your health drains to a dangerous level, an irritating and unceasing beeping tone plays continuously. (Again, like Zelda, but Neutopia's version is much more shrill.)   If you stick with Neutopia for the long haul, you'll ultimately find that there are several things that set it apart from its obvious inspiration, though none are revolutionary. Jazeta will eventually travel to new and different overworlds. The dungeon-crawling crypts get more interesting visually the further along you go. And a pause menu compass helps to always point you in the next right direction to go. But the foundation stays the same all throughout, so only sign on for this adventure if you know you'll enjoy more of the same from The Legend of Zelda.TurboGrafx fans have showered praise on Neutopia for the past 18 years, and much of that is deserved. It's certainly a solid adventure, with decent handling and an acceptably lengthy quest. A good game overall. But original, it's not. Never will you find a more direct clone of the first Legend of Zelda, as Neutopia shamelessly  though successfully  copies that 8-bit Nintendo game design. If you're a fan of Zelda 1, you could take offense at this title stepping on your classic's toes. Or, alternatively, you could invest the 600 Wii Points it would take to investigate these claims and find out for yourself just how egregious it all is. In the end, I'd recommend the latter. Because it's a copy of Zelda  but at least it's a good one.", "date": "Sep 8, 2007"}
