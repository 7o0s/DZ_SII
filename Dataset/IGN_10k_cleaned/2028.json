This time around, or should I say, this season, EA has gone out on a limb to bring North American gamers a rather foreign sports treat. That is, EA has brought rugby to the US for the first time since the Genesis days.   Last time I checked, rugby was quite difficult to watch on TV here in the US (if it's shown at all), and there isn't much of a professional calling for the sport here in the US. Sure, we had a rugby team (at UC Berkeley) when I attended college, but then again, we also had a lacrosse team, and an Ultimate Frisbee team, too.  The point, which is already well under way, is that I find EA's decision quite experimental, unusual, and even slightly odd. I can only expect that from a financial respect, EA's sales of Rugby in the US are pure gravy, since the game's core territories, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, received it exceptionally well. And so EA must have figured, ~Hey, why not?~   Even though I knew next to nothing about the sport going into this review (scrums, rucks? What?), I found that rugby is an engaging, exciting sport, and EA's rugby is an interesting attempt at conveying the sport, and that in the end, it's a competitive enjoyable game, regardless of one's knowledge of it.   Gameplay  Rugby, much like football, is a game of field position, but in this sport there is a slightly different way of achieving the advantage than in football. In fact, there are dozens of ways in which the sports are different, and actually many ways in which the sports are similar, but I'll keep them to a minimum for brevity's sake. The point is, with rugby, EA has created a multifaceted control scheme that changes depending on the position you're in. You can run, sprint, pass, kick, punt, drop-kick, dummy, hand off, grubber kick, tackle, switch players, and more. In essence, you can perform all of the moves you can in real rugby.    Featuring 20 international teams, including the New Zealand All Blacks, the Australian Wallabies, the South African Springboks, England, Scotland, and France, among others, the game is very deep with teams and players. Gamers can select from up to 40 different players per team, with as many as 600 player characters in all. EA secured licenses from RFU, the ARU, the NZRU, the SARFU, FFR, SRU, the Bledisloe Cup and the Tri-Unions, so a huge slew of teams, their official logos outfits, and arenas (23 stadia from all of the major rugby-oriented countries around the world), are represented.   The play-by-play commentary from the ~voice of rugby,~ Bill McLaren, and Jamie Salmon, is great stuff. It's not been Americanized or dumbed down, and it's wonderful to hear the McLaren's accent as well as his take on things. My favorite is, ~Ahh, there's little hodgy podgy going on there.~ (Wha? Hodgy podgy?)   Like the game itself, EA's simulation of it brings out the most exciting and most boring aspects of the game. Running, passing, kicking, gaining field position, and ultimately scoring are extremely fun. I can't tell you how excited and relieved I was when I finally learned how to score, after having been beaten so many times. Passing, and dummy passing is great fun, and kicking the ball while on the run for a three-point goal is also very satisfying. Unlike American football, kicking while on the run is quite a thrill, and justifiably, difficult to execute in a crowd. Drop kicking is key to gaining field position and can make or break your game. With the camera (on default) at a relatively high position (Open play Rear Cam), players can see a good portion of the field, and can perform the necessary passes or runs without being hindered. There are five camera positions in all, but the default is best.    When it comes to boring, frustrating, heart-attack inducing gameplay, however, Rugby is one of the best games I know of. Scrums, rucks and mauls are the least interesting aspect of the game, and are handled with a button-mashing function that doesn't always appear fair, or worse, don't appear to be dependent on skill.   For example, a player with the ball hits the grass, and a scrum begins. Players from both teams run into a mass of your team on one side, and theirs on the other side, pushing to gain position. They can't touch the ball, but can eventually gain position over it so that a neutral player on one end can pick it up and resume play. Sometimes, you get the ball, other times you don't, but despite dozens of attempts at getting better position, smashing the button faster or sooner than my opponent, gaining control over the ball in this aspect of the game seems almost random.   If the better button-masher won, I'd be happy with that, but that's not what happens. This aspect of the videogame, which is about 30%-40% of it, is dull, and infuriating, and totally drags down the game's momentum and my interest level.   Again, I'm no expert of rugby the sport, but rather I'm talking about the videogame. Not knowing the sport very well, several aspects of the sport, and the videogame, baffled me. I never knew exactly how to handle line-outs best, despite reading the manual, and the several set plays that pop up in a window just never seemed to make a significant difference, regardless of what I chose.   The other big problem I encountered was in the menu system. It's crowded like a closet filled to the ceiling with stuffed animals. This creates two dilemmas: first, it puts too much information on the screen at once, and two the text shrinks to a ridiculously small size that can't be read by most people on a standard sized TV.    I found the game to be mostly fair in the AI department, aside from scrums, and have had my fair share of wins versus losses during a season. Learning that some players are better runners than others, or better tacklers, or kickers, broadens and deepens the game to another level. Some opponents can throw off your tacklers better than others, and can clearly run faster, but the game almost always places your many players in the their correct positions during the course of the game, so it's rare that you find yourself screaming, ~Where are my guys?~ It does happen, but not in an unbalanced way, or very often.   I did, however, learn to beat the game like I have never any game before. I picked New Zealand, and I was playing against, I think South Africa, and I beat the game 90-0. Yes, 90-0. It was very fun, indeed. It was ridiculous, too. I don't think that any rugby game has ever had the score 90-0, and this game shouldn't allow it to happen either. What I did to locate the money-play was to simply get the kickoff and run it (by pressing sprint -- Circle), without passing, down the far end of the field in a wide arcing run. You see, passing slows down the game, and if you have a fast runner on your team, just hog it, and run. I cleared every single opponent with some room to spare and ran the ball back on every kickoff down the whole of the field for a score. Bad, bad, bad.   In the end, I had far more fun playing rugby than I anticipated. And heck, although I'm no connoisseur, I know a lot more about rugby than I did before. Overall, EA's Rugby is a functional game, that while perhaps needing some fine improvements here and there and plugging up a few money plays, delivers a good, fair, and exhilarating rugby experience. My biggest complaints are that there is just too much button mashing, and oftentimes it doesn't seem that the button mashing really has any effect at all.    Graphics  Rugby is a decent looking game. The engine created by the English-based Creative Assembly is not as graphically enhanced as the first Madden engine, and so numerous aspects, from the player models to the fields, don't have the finesse or detail that Madden NFL 2001 did.   For instance, the players have no actual human-looking hands, which was always a complaint about PlayStation games. No individualized fingers either. These are small details that can be overlooked, but the character models don't have faces either. They're more like poor impressionist paintings. And this does come into play when you see replays and close-ups. The fields are relatively plain looking, and when rain comes down it has little effect on the field or the players' looks.   When you spend enough time looking at the game, however, a number of excellent graphic aspects do appear. The most notable one is the motion-capture work. The first time I noticed the characters really simulating real live rugby players was when I saw my player tackle an opponent. The tackles are awesome looking. When an opponent is attempting to run around you, the defensive player will swing his hands back, spring into a crouch position, jump at him with a good leap, and wrap his arms around the opponent for the tackle. All of the tackling, running, and kicking animations are well done.   Sound  Like I said before, the color commentary is great, for what my opinion is worth, anyway. I mean, I don't listen to much (OK, almost none) rugby, so it's all quite novel to me, but Mr. McLaren's insights appeared spot-on from what I could tell. Also, I just loved listening to his voice and accent. Ha! But what do I know?!   The rest of the sounds are quite standard. You have a decent set of crowd cheers, and grunts from the players themselves, although come to think of it, they're all pretty simple and don't vary too much. More variety in the players' voices and grunts would have been nice. Similarly, the game's background music was equally unremarkable. Rock and roll, loud and heart-pumping, just the right default music to get a sports fan in the mood.OK, so I'm a yank, and I know little to nothing about rugby. Whatever. I played a lot of this game, and I learned a lot about the sport, and I know that I would come back to this game over and over and enjoy it because it's totally different than most American sports. It's not the regular American thing, thus it's more intriguing than football, baseball, basketball, or hockey. The strategy gets quite deep, and the team play is totally engaging once you get the hand of it. Learning to sprint, brush off tackles, dummy pass, and to punt-kick, or drop kick, while running adds a whole new level to the game. I know that I'm still thinking about this game as a sort of weird football (American football) mutation (which is actually the exact opposite of the how it really happened), but like I said, I'm pure yank. So, it's fun, and anyone interesting in sports, especially rugby, will enjoy this game. Codes Editor Chris Carle loves it, even though I beat him 90% of the time, and he's jonesing for me to finish playing so he can play it himself.", "date": "Jul 18, 2001"}
