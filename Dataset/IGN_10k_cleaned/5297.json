With high hopes, we dug into Arcanum, and many of us found it slow to get going and visually unimpressive, although it was rewarding in the long run. Temple of Elemental Evil apparently suffered from being pushed out the door a wee bit early. Therefore, the anticipation for Bloodlines isn't nearly as high as it could have been, in an ideal world where every game went out the door polished to a high gloss. It's unfortunate, because Bloodlines is a true RPG that hearkens back to Fallout and its Baldur's Gate brethren, while providing the impressive visuals of Valve's Source engine. The story is rich, the world is deep, and the heart of the RPG pumps strongly in its veins.  Bloodlines is set in White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade universe, where vamps, werewolves, demons, and other fantastical creatures are alive and well but keep their profiles below the public eye. Not only that, but these creatures are responsible for molding the history of the world, the public part of which is just a tip of the iceberg of their centuries-long machinations. You'll start out as a member of the Camarilla, which comprises approximately half of the 13 clans purportedly descended from Cain. In this universe, the Camarilla officially position Cain as a myth, while the Sabbat, the bad guys, believe he was their forefather but violently oppose the near-mythical group immediately descended from Cain--the Antediluvians.   I'm probably getting some details wrong, but the point is that the Masquerade universe has a complex backstory and the game does a great job of easing you into the role of a Fledgeling. During the fairly frequent but reasonably short loading screens, you'll be treated to bits and pieces which, by the end of the game, help to give you a sense of the big picture. The bulk of your understanding will come from in-depth conversations with the other characters in the game. Or, of course, you can choose to ignore it and just do your thing.    And herein lies the beauty of Bloodlines: choice. You'll get to pick what looks to be any of the Camarilla clans, and each one has a very different inherent skillset. The Tremere, who stole the secrets of vampirism ages ago, are very good with blood magic but have a cap on their physical combat abilities. The Toreadors and Ventrue are very good socially, but are similarly handicapped in combat. The Gangrel and Brujah, however, are beefy warriors but not so good at a cocktail party.  Experience is gained not through killing beasts but from completing a quest, although the two may coincide. You'll get a few points to distribute among your favored stats, and believe me, you'll spend more than a few moments pondering your choice. As with the Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, there's no way to become good at everything, although I would recommend putting points into combat, as it is unavoidable. You'll also want to consider lockpicking, which can give you a shortcut around some tough areas, or computer hacking, which you can use to open doors, unlock safes, and disable various security measures, thus making your life a little easier. Suffice to say you have a ton of options for character development.  And what's great about having all of these options is that it can become a very different game depending on what you choose. You'll have separate abilities for intimidation, seduction, haggling, and so forth, allowing additional dialogue options. Just outside your apartment in Santa Monica, for example, is a well-dressed guy who has no quests to give you or things to sell you. If you didn't have high enough intimidation, you'd never know that you could shake him down for cash and even convince him to give you his fancy watch. You won't be able to talk your way through the game, but you'll get plenty of amusement from the imaginative threats and cheesy come-ons.      But I haven't said a word about the visuals. Most of you know by now that Bloodlines uses Valve Software's Source engine. This doesn't include physics, animation, or character models, but you get lighting, water effects, some great shader capabilities, and those eerily realistic eyes that follow you as you walk past. In a word, the game looks great.  The faces of the characters can be awesomely realistic, particularly with The Sheriff, Skelter, VV, and the Baron of Santa Monica. Besides the owner of the LA nightclub, though, hair doesn't get quite the same treatment, and clothing doesn't look as good when viewed up close during the numerous conversations. It's something that only sticks out every once in a while, though, and doesn't detract from the overall experience. What can put a kink in things is the occasionally kludgy animation, particularly during the cutscenes. In-game, animation is fine, aside from a overhead-reducing effect that makes people look a little robotic at a distance.  Since I mentioned visuals, I shouldn't neglect sound, either. Although the song that plays in the main menu took more than a few cues from Massive Attack, the rest of it is original and generally appropriate. It's fun to be in the clubs especially, because there's always some good stuff playing. You can even boogie down on the dance floor. Voice acting is great across the board, with some familiar-sounding voices here and there. Everyone seems to be taking their job very seriously--no phoned-in performances. And the amount of dialogue in the game borders on the surreal.  Lip syncing isn't quite as sharp as it is in Half-Life 2, but it's pretty good on its own. There's plenty of facial expressions as well, and often their expressions will change according to how you talk to them. You can be an ass to anyone in the game, or you can be polite. It usually pays to be nice, though.  The pump of the Utica shotgun is the best I've heard in a long time, but unfortunately you can't fire while reloading, which is a no-no in my book. You load six shells at a time, and it seems like it takes forever in the middle of a firefight. In general, though, the many firearms available just don't seem to be as effective as melee. With enough points in the Protean skill (provided you chose the appropriate clan), you can transform into a man-bat and really tear people up. There's also a couple nasty weapons along the way, like a sledgehammer and katana.    And with each different melee weapon comes a different silent kill. If an enemy isn't aware of your presence, you can sneak up behind them and take them out quickly. The katana plunges through their chest, the sledgehammer whips around to smash their head in--this game ain't for kids.  The point is that the game is chock-full of detail. You can become a partner in a club, obtain a ghoul (a human slave, basically), and get some unique and very useful items for certain side quests, of which there are dozens, some of them fairly involved. With most of the quests, you have multiple ways of solving it, and can get extra rewards for being the hero. In Bloodlines, it's crucial to not expose your vampiric abilities in public.  If you do this five times, you lose the game. However, certain quests will earn you Masquerade Redemption, and there's more than enough of those to go around to keep you safe through the end credits. One Redemption in particular doesn't involve a quest at all. Bloodlines, like all good RPGs, rewards exploration.      I have to say that combat was a little underwhelming, though. The firearms are only really useful if you sink a good deal of points into them, and your skills without any points are a lot worse than they should be. Everybody can figure out how to point and shoot a pistol, so it doesn't make sense that my aim should be pretty bad--and my reloading skills top notch. Your character is a pro reloader, but the accuracy is kinda drunken. With melee combat, the knockback can get frustrating. There are a lot of attacks that will stall your own, and for a vampire, you don't handle multiple targets well.  Even with respectable defense, you can get nearly killed by two or three guys. When I think of a vampire, particularly one who's supposed to excel at combat, I picture superhuman speed, huge leaps, and lots of evisceration. I guess it's a balance you have to consider, and since this is mostly an RPG, it might tilt things too much towards action if you had weaker, more numerous enemies coming at you. You can do different moves with key combinations, but there's no super move. Combat was good, but I think it could have been better. I also experienced some glitches late in the game where I became immobile when switching to Warform Protean.  But the majority of the glitches seem to reside in the AI. I think Bloodlines is a very enjoyable RPG otherwise, but stealth seems to be given a lot more weight than it should. I played a Gangrel with two out of five possible points in stealth, and I was able to sneak behind people way too often. Their cone of vision seems to plummet dramatically in low light, and there's more than enough of that to go around.  Unfortunately, it gets worse. Many times I was able to silent kill or feed from a guard while another one was standing right next to him. This is just not good. Second, stealthing seems to break some trap triggers. A guy busts through a wall or comes crashing through the ceiling, the odds are he's going to stand motionless instead of continuing the charge. It broke immersion, and it tended to happen a lot towards the end of game. It didn't make things easy, though, because there were a lot of these set pieces, and plenty of boss monsters to go around. I'll just say you better stock up before that final quest.    Speaking of final quest, you have multiple options here, which I've always been a sucker for. Depending on which way you decide to go, things will end up much differently. What's also nice is that there isn't a clear way to go. I'll just leave it at that.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a much stronger game than the previous one in the series. It does the genre right, with character choices that effect the world, dialogue choices that effect your fate, and plenty of things to do and places to poke around in. Replayability lies in the widely varied character design options, since the story is pretty linear, multiple endings notwithstanding. Unfortunately, the AI has the intelligence of a doorknob sometimes, which keeps the shine off an otherwise delightful and multilayered experience.", "date": "Nov 17, 2004"}
