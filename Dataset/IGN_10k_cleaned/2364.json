This has been the story throughout the Monster Rancher series, so it's no surprise to see it unchanged on the Game Boy Advance incarnation.  Maybe I was foolish for wanting more, but I wanted more.  Monster Rancher Advance offers nothing new to the series and seems a little less fun than previous versions.  Then again, maybe all you need in this life is a bottle of wine, some monsters, and a familiar format.

Okay Frankenstein, it's time to make a monster.  The type of monster you create depends on the word you enter at the start of creation.  You'll learn new words as the game progresses, but for your first monster you can put in any four-letter word you want (just as long as mom isn't watching).  I chose 'Spaz' because it reminded me of certain people in the office.  'Spaz' netted me a great big rock dude.  You're a little limited with your first creation, but once you have built up your first beast you'll start getting new options to make bigger and badder creatures.  You have to be patient with this, because building up your first beastie takes time.    There are over 400 monsters in Monster Rancher Advance, many of which can only be created by combining monsters together.  If your goal is getting your hands on all 400 plus beasts, you better put your life on hold for a good long while.  By my calculations, it would take someone 2.6 years to find and build up all the monsters in Monster Rancher Advance.  Yowsa!  Well, at least MRA has longevity in its corner.  Having played the game for the past few days, I can't say that I would be willing to invest that much of my life on this game, but I know those who love the series will do so gladly.    To get your monster to be a real bad ass (which is, of course, the goal), you'll need to put them through a lot of training.  Training takes up most of the game, which is a major drawback.  Training consists of selecting a coach to raise different stats each week.  So if, for example, I want to raise my guy's strength, all I do is select the proper coach and watch a short animation.  The animation is always the same thing with results being failure, success, or great (which gives an extra boost to the stat).  The animation is the same thing, over and over and over and over and over.  Oy.  For $3000 you can do special training that involves sparring with a coach.  That's much more fun since you are involved in the training.  Of course, it costs $3000 to do the training and the only way to get money is to win tournaments which you can only win if you've trained enough.  Welcome to the vicious cycle of Monster Rancher Advance.  The combat system should be familiar to Monster Rancher veterans.  To a newbie, it can be a bit confusing at first.  Your command of your monster in the ring is dependant on its level of loyalty.  Treat your monster right and it will obey.  Treat them like you treated your last girlfriend and they will stand in the ring and do nothing.  The battles are 2D but offer some great animations.  Watch as your beastie gets zorched by a lightning bolt, or stunned by a kiss, or spiked by a giant ball.  There are plenty of skills to learn and to see, keeping combat from becoming mundane like the training.  To win matches, you'll need to create strategies to utilize your beast's strengths and weaknesses.  Though I was gritting my teeth half the time, I enjoyed the combat system.  Monster Rancher Advance is missing the right balance between combat and training.  There's just too much training needed and too little reward for all that you must do.  I put some hours into training my guy, making him a well respected champion.  But, before I knew it, he was past his prime.  The old beast no longer benefited from training and he got tired far too often.  The options once your monster gets long in the tooth are limited.  You can put them on ice ala Han Solo, retire them, make them a coach for your future monsters, or combine them with another monster to make an all new creation.  I decided to combine him with another monster I created, Smokey.  Together the two made a really sweet looking update of my original creation.  But, of course, he was a newborn and I had to start the training process all over again.  And there is the second vicious cycle of Monster Rancher Advance.  Unlike other Rancher incarnations, there are no missions to undertake and nowhere to go with your monster other than the town, training, or battle.  For me, it made MRA get old real fast.  There are story arcs in the game, though, that you don't interact with.  As the game progresses, NPCs will talk in front of you, laying out plot lines in an attempt to keep you intrigued.  But since you aren't taking an active role in these plots, it gets annoying.  You see little of your character and too much of the others.  Why not bring in dialogue, story, and mystery that directly involves the main character?  It's like watching a movie where the protagonist is sitting in the theater with you eating Jujubees.    Like I said earlier, the combat animations are great.  Some of the creature designs come from earlier versions of Monster Rancher, but there are also many creatures unique to the GBA version.  The creatures are nicely detailed with unique touches for the many races available.  The mountainous backgrounds never seem to change, but the weather does.  Some days it's sunny, other days bring blizzards.  There were moments where I was sick of looking at the screen.  My monster just stood around repeating the same animation again and again, with the same background, and the same tired music.  It's only in combat that the game livens up.  The best aspect of MRA is the multiplayer option.  You can set up a tournament with up to three friends or link up with a buddy for a tag-team battle.  The tag-team battle works just like Tecmo's DOA series.  You start out the match with one monster in the ring.  When your beast is low on health, tag out and bring in your other monster.  The longer the first monster rests outside the ring, the more health it regains.  The tag-team mode totally rocks.  If nothing else, the multiplayer option gives you a reason to keep building better monsters.  Nothing feels as good as kicking the crap out of your pal with your own creation.  The hard part about judging a Monster Rancher game is that it's part of a long running series.  And people either love the series or hate it.  So, do I judge the game with the fan base in mind, or do I examine it as its own entity?  I thought about that before beginning this review and realized that just because MRA is part of a series, doesn't mean it can't be more than it is.  That's, afterall, the challenge of making games.  To keep them fresh, to push boundaries, to expand on the design.  Well, Monster Ranchers Advance doesn't do that.  It's nothing new in the series.  Still, with some colorful (and frustrating) battles, numerous monsters, and endless hours of gameplay, MRA will definitely appeal to fans of the Rancher series.  But, I think, those who haven't cared for the series so far won't be changing their opinions over this one.  If you like the series, buy this game.  If you don't, you'll probably want to side-step this one.", "date": "Dec 8, 2001"}
