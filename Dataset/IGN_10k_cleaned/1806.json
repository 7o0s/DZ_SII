Don't send me hate mail on this subject, fan boys - I won't stand for it!  Your favorite animation series (and mine too... only under the proto-culture laced veil of Robotech) deserves far better than the uninspired efforts its been getting, be it through the craptacular VFX games on the PlayStation, or the Saturn's so-so Do You Remember Love? (this one was an okay little shooter, but there wasn't really too much game).  A review that begins like the above can go either way.  ~Fortunately, Shoeisha steps in with Macross M3 and saves both the day and the name of a classic animated series.~  Or, ~Sadly, Shoeisha steps in with Macross M3 and beats us all down with further evidence that there's no end in sight to our continued torment.~  So which is it going to be?  Well, in Japan, NBA Live for the PS2 outsold Dreamcast's Macross M3 in first day sales.  Apparently, Japanese gamers have taken William Faulkner's advice and become really good crap detectors. Macross M3 continues where the original series left off.  Please forgive me if some of my terminology doesn't jive proper with the series - I've never watched Macross in Japanese form.  Following the great Zentradi war, in which mankind fought against the invading super-sized race of Zentradi warriors, the planet Earth lay in disarray, with most of its population having been wiped out during a great battle from years before.  The SDF-1, the massive flag ship of the Earth, which once housed thousands and allowed for great urban centers to be erected in a matter of weeks, now lay dormant in the Bay of New Macross City, having been destroyed by Kyron, the mad Zentradi  Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayse, Lynn Minmay - these were the main characters of the story that ended so.  But what about Rick's buddy?  Rick was a cool pilot and all during the original series, but he was always bested by the blue haired, and very unlikely, Maximillian Jenius, who flew his Valkyrie (known as a Veritech in Robotech) fighter jet with the greatest of ease, speeding past Zentradi battle pods even without the on-again-off-again love of Lynn Minmay.  In Macross M3, we get to experience the story of what happened to Max and his wife, Miria (she's a miniaturized Zentradi, by the way - it's a long story, and it involves the corniest television scene ever).  The story, which was apparently penned by the original creators of the Macross series, takes us through the lives of Max, Miria and their newly adopted child, Moaramia (M3... get it?) following the war.  As one might expect, Shoeisha has chosen to make the convertible Valkyrie fighter jets that are the series' trademark the focus of the game.  These are no ordinary jets - in fact, they were imitated at one point by that classic amongst classics, The Transformers.  The Valkyries inspire awe because of their ability to transform between three different modes: Fighter (a jet plane), Battloid (picture a jet that's transformed into a humanoid robot complete with a cannon) and Gerwalk (its top is a fighter, its bottom is a battloid).  The fighting sequences in the show featured the Valkyries soaring acrobatically through the air in approach of an enemy ship, switching to Gerwalk form and coasting along the ship's belly while blasting enemies, then engaging one on one with a massive Zentradi warrior in Battloid form (a Zentradi is about the size of a Valkyrie, not coincidentally - there's actually a lot more to the story than you might think).  In the game, you pilot a Valkyrie through a series of missions, most with multiple parts.  Following a brief story sequence, you're called to a briefing room where the upcoming mission is described to you (don't worry if you don't understand Japanese - the objectives of the missions are pretty obvious).  You then select between Max, Miria and later Moaramia to be featured in the mission, then select your jet.  From the beginning, you're able to select a base VF-1J fighter, but as you complete missions, you'll earn more powerful (and occasionally oddly shaped) fighters such as the VF-9, VF-14 and even a special Zentradi battle unit.  Each fighter is rated on attack speed, defense speed, missile capacity - all the basics.  Before finally heading out to battle, you can choose to equip your Valkyrie with so-called plug-ins.  Each Valkyrie has a certain number of equipable slots for these upgrade devices.  You'll eventually be able to equip nine such devices, examples being a plug-in that increases you attack and shield powers, and one that allows you to launch more missiles.  The more powerful plug-ins take up multiple slots, and your only restriction is that you can't exceed the number of open slots on your ship.  Once you've finally gone out to battle, and pretty much regardless of what Valkyrie or plug-ins you've chosen, the game plays the same way.  Combat takes place from a behind-the-ship view.  There's no radar, but an arrow points you towards enemies, and once you have them in sight, they're clearly marked.  You can switch between the three Valkyrie forms at the touch of a button, some forms being required for certain situations.  Jets can fly through the air faster and have available a limited turbo boost, which replenishes with time.  The Gerwalk form can coast along the ground and hop from target to target, giving you brief moments of ample control in the air, without being forced to move in a forward direction.  The battloid form can automatically aim at an enemy, although this requires some of your boost power.   In addition to these maneuvers, you can make use of a few pre-scripted ~action~ moves.  By punching in combinations of the X, Y and B buttons on your controller, you can make your Valkyrie launch a massive missile attack, fire his cannon in all directions, blast off to another area of the battle field (uhh, see below before getting excited about this), and dodge attacks.  Doing these moves depletes an action-point rating, which, like the boost power, regenerates with time.  You can do these moves from any form - even if you select the missile command while in jet form, your Valkyrie will transform to battloid form for you.   The Missions themselves come in two different varieties: ground and air.  While in the air, your objective is usually to take out all incoming enemy craft.  Occasionally, you'll fight a one-on-one battle with a single air craft, and one mission has you destroying two bombers that you're sandwiched between.  The ground missions vary.  A couple of them have you jet through caverns or the innards of a ship, avoiding or taking out enemies along the way, while others ask that you take out specific targets in a more limited area.  All missions have to be completed before a timer runs out.  So where does the game go wrong?  Just about everywhere, it turns out.  Let's have a look-see at the frightening faces of a cheaply produced licensed game.  Hold hands, and don't let go - it's going to get scary.  Before leaving, we'll be sure and offer up the hope that something like this won't ever happen again.   First, the story.  It may well be the case that the creators of the original series had a hand in the story's creation, but it's not of much significance, as they could've penned it while using the toilet - at least as far as the scenarios actually used in the game are concerned.  The story is straightforward stuff, told through brief glimpses into the lives of Max, Miria and Moaramia prior to battle via still-frame sequences that are fully voiced, presumably by the original Japanese voice actors (am I the only one who thinks that the US version of Max's voice sounds more like the character looks?).  But that's it - there's no interaction what-so-ever, no wandering through a ship.  There are a few passages as a battle begins (but never actually during the course of a battle), and some of the battles are a part of the story, but one gets the feeling that the story wasn't the central point to the production.   One interesting note, at least for Macross fans.  The story actually spans a great amount of time in the lives of the three M's, with each mission being separated by a few years.  You'll see Max and Miria board the Algenicus cruiser and form the Dancing Skull team, then head out to the stars.  Throughout the game's many years, they'll encounter Moaramia and partake of several missions, with various Valkyrie jets appearing throughout the time.  Unfortunately, the game's story is presented in such a way that Max doesn't seem to have much fan-fare following the war - at least we don't see anyone in his life aside from the few characters in the game.  With the lack of emphasis on story, it's no wonder that the mission objectives seem a bit generic.  Looking past the story-based goals of the missions, there's nothing that screams out Macross to me, aside from the Valkyries - and they've got serious control issues!  In jet form, things are just fine, although a real radar system would've been nice, but switch to Battloid and Gerwalk forms, and movement becomes clumsy, especially in the ground-based missions.  The Gerwalk has difficulty turning and moves surprisingly slow.  The Battloids also run through liquid protoculture (which I presume would be thick).  I ended up using the auto-aim feature and hoping for the best rather than making them slowly turn around.  The slow movement of these two forms brings up another point - slowdown.  It seems as though Macross M3 was originally designed as a flying game, and its engine was hastily adapted for ground missions.  The ground missions at times seem to slow down from the moment you start the level to when it completes.  The screen crawls even when there's nothing on screen except your fighter.  Maybe the graphics engine can't tell the difference between a visible enemy and an enemey that's obscured by a wall (your targeting system certainly can't - it displays targets when they're obscured by multiple walls.  Naughty, naughty!).  And don't even get me started about the fogging in the ground levels.  I believe I actually caught up to the fogging line a couple of times (or, I came dangerously close).  Some ground levels have such horrible fog that the fog itself pops-up!   The game is at its best, in fact, in those moments where you're far off the graound, flying in jet form through the sky missions, and I do actually find myself wanting to go back and play a couple of these.  These missions are repetitive, but the mechanics involved, which require good use of the one-button transformation ability, are occasionally enjoyable.  Mostly I found myself locking on and firing at a group of enemies in the Battloid form, then switching to jet form and speeding away from them and their bullets, and occasionally using one of the action maneuvers.  Of course, there's that mission where the lone enemy can outrun your missiles - see the video below for the cool effect that comes about because of this.  And yet, even these sequences have a big-problem, one that will be familiar to those who've played the VFX games on the PlayStation.  VFX defined ~The String Factor~ in a flight game, where the jet that you're piloting seems to be suspended by a string through a moving world.  Macross M3 replicates that feeling.  There's little sense of actual flight, the problem seeming to emerge from the fact that there are no visual land-marks by which one can judge distance.  You seem to be in a bubble that can never approach the ground or a set of clouds.  In one stage, this is taken to absurd levels, as you're attempting to destroy two bomber planes directly above and below you.  Turn your ship towards one of the bombers, slam on the gas, and watch in wonder as space-time folds in such a way that your ship and the bomber maintain the same relative distance.  I suppose if I had to say one nice thing about Macross M3, I'd have to mention its flight sequences.  But I don't HAVE to say anything nice about it.  Even with the occasionally cool sequence, Macross M3 is pretty much pointless.  There's little of merit, even for hardcore fans of the show.  Even the box is rather lame - it looks good on the outside with a stylish picture of Max, Miria and Moaramia, but look inside and you'll find a collector's card, and nothing more.  At least Sega has sense enough to go overboard on the packaging when giving us a bad game.  I said I'd offer hope that one day, someone will make a Macross game that does the series justice.  But I'm not going to do that, because I've now determined that it's the fate of man to suffer from wretchedly bad cross promotional products.  I think I'll hook up my Turbo Duo and play through the classic 2D Macross shooter and strategy games, rather than taking further offense that someone has screwed around with this perfect license - again.  -- Anoop Gantayat, Contributor", "date": "Feb 28, 2001"}
