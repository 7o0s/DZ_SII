And right about now you've just fallen asleep, realising that this is yet another WWII game, a historical period you got bored of the 437th time you played through it. If I could embed a little .wav file on the page here, it'd scream something like ~Wake up dummy! This ain't no generic WWII shooter. It's actually bloody original not to mention fun.~ Sadly my HTML skills aren't quite at that level, so I've already lost half of you to the Sandman.    For those who have bothered to stick around, I've got good news, especially if you like innovative gameplay that can't be shoe-horned into one specific genre. Battlestations: Midway is one of those newfangled genre-mashers, that takes the tactical approach of an RTS and melds it seamlessly with straight up action shooting, with a side-serve of sim-lite goodness. But unlike most genre-benders, this one is actually good. Gasp.    Unfortunately these games are hell for game reviewers - there's no way I can just throw in the name of the game into Template #473 (used for above average action shooters), and Template #18 won't work either (that one's for RTS). I'm going to have to describe the fundamental gameplay mechanics, and hope that my description somehow conveys just how exciting it all is when in play. Here goes.    If you look at the screenshots, you'll notice that the game looks somewhat like a very lite-styled sim, or action game. Depending on your mood, you can take direct control of basically any vehicle that saw action in the Pacific. Submarines, destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, bombers, fighters, jet skis, hovercraft, and even trained dolphins are at your command. So I made the last three up, but you should have an idea of the encyclopaedic range of vehicles with which you'll smash the Emperor's fleet.   Bah, it's nothing but a scratch. These ships can take a severe beating.  As expected, each vehicle handles very differently. Ships and subs have throttle and rudder controls, and the larger the boat, the more it handles like a beached whale. Subs can also dive to three different levels, one for attacking, another for hiding and the third for really hiding - at the risk of implosion. The boats are bristling with weaponry, broken up into three categories; artillery, which is great for long range peppering of targets; torpedoes, slow to reload but packing a mean punch, and anti-aircraft, which is fine for, well, shooting aircraft (it's also pretty good at chewing through flesh-packed crates, also known as landing craft).    Each of these weapons is easy to fire, but hard to master. A single crosshair for each system is provided. Even if you're manning the floating island that is the Japanese battleship Yamato, with its twenty or so heavy artillery guns, you'll still only have one crosshair, which can be rotated 360 degrees around the boat. Around this crosshair are pretty green and red lights - each light representing a separate cannon on the ship. If it's red, it means the cannon is either reloading or you're pointing at an angle that it can't reach. If it's green, it means the cannon is ready to reach out and touch someone.    It's a very simple system, so you probably think it'll be pretty simple to hit the other guys. And you'd be sinking-to-the-bottom-of-the-Mariana-trench wrong. While using the AA is fairly simple, both artillery and torpedoes have their own quirks that take time to master. Torpedoes take a long time to reload, and even longer to get to the target, so you'll need to gaze into your crystal ball of shooting solutions to figure out where to aim. Artillery doesn't take quite as long, but they're still lobbed upwards on to the target, and can take a few seconds to reach longer ranges. They also tend to spread their shells over a relatively large area at range, so you'll need to score multiple hits to do any serious damage. As we described it in the preview, it's kind of like Worms with battleships, figuring out where to lob each shot and adjusting the trajectory after each shot.    Women and children first. Actually, screw that - every man for himself!  Blazing Angels players... all three of them... will be familiar with the handling of the aircraft - they've got all the obligatory controls from rudders to ailerons to throttles, but it's by no means an IL2-wannabe. They're probably the easiest weapon system to control, with bombs and torpedoes being much easier to deliver than the ship-based systems. As a result air-power can be the determining factor in battles, so you'll need to ensure they're not shot out of the sky before they can hit their target.   The variety of vehicles and weapons stops the action from ever becoming boring. If you tire of using one vehicle type, you can switch to another with a quick flick of the D-pad, and the early missions focus on different platforms to give you a good grasp of how to use them best. You'll probably be quite comfortable with them already though, as the game has one of the most comprehensive, if not gripping, tutorials we've ever seen. It'll take you over an hour to finish the tute, but it's absolutely necessary if you want to have any chance of hoisting that flag on Iwo Jima.     So that's one side of the equation out of the way, but what of the other? All this talk of RTS play has surely got the Company of Heroes fans salivating. And it's in this regard that Battlestations: Midway truly earns it badge of originality.   As you might have gathered already, many of the missions will see you controlling numerous different vehicle types at once. While the game eases you in with only a handful at a time, eventually you'll be trying to manage a carrier, airfield, destroyers, shipyard, subs, PT-boats and a few squadrons all at once. This is where the powerful map and order system comes into use. And this is where the game gets really stressful - it's kind of like playing chess with a three second time limit on each move, and you have to move twelve pieces at once.    From the overhead map you can order each unit to patrol, attack, re-arm, escort or just do its own thing. Thanks to some very intuitive controls, it won't take long to set up a nice battle plan, with destroyers shepherding the carrier, a gaggle of planes keeping the skies safe and a sub lurking on the outskirts of the fleet. If you leave the formation to do its own thing, you'll be treated to the sight of your destroyers getting harpooned by a swarm of torpedoes while your planes are shot out of the sky, plummeting into your carrier and causing even more damage.     You'll soon learn that your battle plan will need to be as fluid as the deep blue sea you're fighting in - keeping an eye on each unit as well as the enemy's tactics is crucial. It's not quite as micro-managey as other RTS games though, as the AI generally does a good job of keeping your units alive, but you'll still spend more time directing units from the map than you will jumping in to individually control them.   The Carrier is the God of your battlefield. Worship and respect it.  Sadly, there's one flaw with this system when playing the single player game. No matter how many times I've read The Art of War or studied the US Navy Fleet Tactics handbook (1943 edition), I found that missions were always a matter of trial and error. It'll take a couple of runs through a mission to figure out what needs to go where at each point of the operation, and you'll rarely complete a mission the first time around. Still, when you do figure out what to do, and you watch your units operate as a cohesive whole, it's a very satisfying experience. With dozens of units all battling it out, the visual spectacle is very impressive, although frame rate issues reared their chugging head often during our testing. However, we've heard from others that the game runs smoothly, so it's most likely the fact that we ran at 1080i that caused the slow down.    What this shot doesn't show is the secret winged keel that made these ships so speedy.  The other major issue with the single player game is the campaign length, or lack thereof. You'll sweep through the major battles of the Pacific in about five hours, as there are only ten missions. Cranking up the difficulty helps, but can also be an infuriating experience as there's very little room for error. Some lovely looking cutscenes help pad things out, but their excruciating dialogue detracts from their Pearl Harbour-esque action scenes. Kind of like the movie, actually. Another dozen standalone challenges double the length of the entire game, and while they provide the only opportunity to control the Emperor's fleet, it would have been nice if they somehow slotted into the game's campaign.    Multiplayer is a different kettle of fish entirely and is, for those with the right mindset, one of the most original and enjoyable Xbox Live games around. Playing one on one is arguably the best way to play, as you don't need to rely on three other players to do their job correctly, which will rarely occur unless you're playing with pals. The old rock-paper-scissors game design has rarely been more exacting than in multiplayer Battlestations: Midway, so you'll need to have a thorough understanding of how each unit does it job. Send the wrong aircraft or ship in to attack, and you're sending it to its doom. Sadly most Xbox players probably won't have the time or inclination to master this complex system, as this audience tends to favour straight shooters rather than chess-like battle simulators.Battlestations: Midway achieves what it aims to deliver; giving the player the feeling that they're controlling an entire fleet engaging in the most spectacular naval battles ever waged in a war. When a battle is raging with dozens of different units tearing each other to shreds, and you're driving it all from the comfort of your couch, you'll really feel like you're wearing a snazzy white suit and admiral's stripes. The mixture of action and strategy works well, but the learning curve due to these two contrasting play-styles is Mount Everest steep - perhaps making this more suited to the PC audience than the more casual Xbox 360 crowd. Virtual admirals will immerse themselves deeply in the waters of this war-game, but for the rest of us it's a hard slog to see how enjoyable this game can be.", "date": "Feb 16, 2007"}
