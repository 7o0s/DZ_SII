In fact, I don't keep up with racing as a sport at all.  I do love racing games, though.  So, you have Buggy Heat, which, in my limited playtime, I found to be a pretty pleasing Japanese title, brought over to the U.S. in the form of TNN Motorsports Hardcore Heat.  The game sports the TNN Motorsports license, but the TNN-based stuff seems to occur in only a few places throughout the game: the title screen, the thank-you section of the credits, and a few new logos, banners and signs in the courses.  To tell you the truth, I do somewhat smell the distinct and horrifying stench of a bogus license.  ASC can breathe some relief, though, as my disconnection with professional racing prevents me from railing on them for this crime.  Instead, all I can do is tell you what I think of Hardcore Heat, apart from its license.  The game was brought over from Japan in what was billed to be a new and improved form.  ASC sped up the title just a bit (it's very noticeable when you're racing), and fixed a few of the control issues.  Unfortunately, they didn't go far enough.  Overall, despite the fact that the game has many, many good points, my experience with TNN Motorsports Hardcore Heat was one more of frustration, rather than fun.  And how am I supposed to recommend a product that will frustrate you into swearing in front of your mom?         Yes, there are many good points to TNN, and there is quite a bit of fun to be had.  I enjoyed the normal level of the championship mode, and taking part in the game's free-run mode is as addictive as it is in most any other racing games.  As I mentioned earlier, There's a good sense of speed, and it's fun playing with all the various views (the in-the-car view, in which you actually see your character steer and shift gears through a little window in the right corner is useless, but utterly cool).  The total of six main courses feature terrain of varying height and bumpiness, along with steep slopes, sharp turns, good background scenery, daytime and nighttime driving, and weather effects.  These tracks are designed well, and some would likely earn even Yu Suzuki's praise.  Special mention should go out to the Peru track, which is shaped like a cross  someone has to use this form of design in another game!  I also like how the game's championship mode is set up.  In normal mode, you race against 7 opponents over 4 courses; in hard more, you race over five courses; in expert mode, you race over six courses.  Your goal is to get as high a place as possible in each race, and you're awarded points based on position.  At the end of the race, the game determines your position based on number of points you and your opponents have.  The great thing about this is that you don't have to get first place in all the courses, as the opponents tend to be varied in their performance, so some will get first in one course, but will place eighth in another course.         Also worth mentioning is the two-player split screen mode.  It's well done with a smooth frame-rate and little graphic loss.  I was hoping for a four player mode, as the DC needs a non-penguin-based racing game of this form, but plenty of fun can be had by two players.  Finally (see, I told you there were plenty of good points) we come to presentation.  CRI has done a fantastic job in this area, whether it be through the game's graphics, sounds, or interface.  Graphically, the game looks good with typical DC high-res graphics, Sonic-style mip-mapping for the track ground, a consistent 30fps, and the coolest buggies and cars I've EVER seen in a game; someone call Hasbro, I want little toy versions of these guys.  There are a few questionable effects to be found in Egypt and America, but overall, especially with the VGA Box, this game will impress you.  Aurally, the music isn't the most memorable, but it gets the job done, and some of it can by kinda catchy.  The buggies make appropriate engine sounds, and the sound of them striking the rough areas of the ground will increase your enjoyment of the race.  The interface itself is gorgeous and appropriately deep, with Gran Tourismo-ish icons, detailed maps before the race for each track, customizable decals and paint jobs for the cars, and a simplified tuning system which allows you to adjust the tires and handling of the vehicles.  One thing of note regarding presentation are the characters.  You don't usually hear of characters being mentioned in conjunction with a racing game, with exception to maybe the super-hot Reiko of Ridge Racer fame, but it's clear from the get-go that CRI wanted people to notice this aspect of their game.  You aren't just racing cars; instead, you're actually taking control of a driver, who happens to own a particular car.  CRI emphasizes this, as you're shown CG shots of the characters as you select their car (with exception to one car, available only for the experienced player).  You can also go into a mode where you view the history and statistics of the characters.  During the race, you'll hear the characters shout out comments at one another; ASC has done a good job in giving English voices to the characters here (my favorite would have to be Sylvie Vogue's hyper-perky ~Go Go Go!~ as she passes by another driver).  This whole notion of a well-defined driver adds a lot of personality to a genre that usually lacks any notion of personality.  It seems that I've had nothing but praise for the whole game, doesn't it?  Well, not quite.  The word ~almost~ comes to mind regarding TNN.  I've had praise for almost every aspect of the game, and the game is almost worthy of your hard-earned cash on 9/9/99.  It's when we come to the issue of the driving model, though, that TNN falls apart.  Certain aspects of the driving model just feel completely wrong.  I've played through the game in its worst form over and over again in order to determine the nature of the problem, and have come up with the silly phrase ~spin mode~ in order to describe it.  See, the problem is that when the cars spin out of control, it seems to be nearly impossible to recover from the spin.  It's almost as if the game senses when you're loosing control, then enters a mode in which you're not allowed to recover.  It's very annoying, particularly when you've just raced through three or four courses on expert mode, only to spin out of control and face the opposite direction, as all your opponent cars pass you up.  There are a few other problems which compound this ~spin mode~ issue.  First off, your car will enter into the spin mode at the most inappropriate times, like when you're going slow, for instance.  Also, striking opponent cars will often enter you into the spin mode as well, despite the fact that you should, usually, remain going straight.  I've tried to compensate for this, by using the sidebreak, slowing down to a near stop at the turns, and turing the wheels every which way, but I always end up in the spin mode.  If this is realistic, then someone please drug me up!   I'll admit that this single problem with the game is subtle, but it was enough to make me swear at my television over and over again, which is a habit usually reserved for our temperamental Editor in Chief (boy am I looking to be fired! [Ed's note  Looking to be? Little does he know we've already hired his replacem..err..nevermind.]).  The problem is somewhat improved over its Japanese counterpart, enough so that when giving initial impressions of the final American product, it seemed that much of it had been fixed.  Ultimately, that's not the case, though, and I have a feeling that anyone who dares to dig past the early moments of the game will figure this out.  It's unfortunate that this one problem has destroyed the game for me, as there are a lot of good elements to it.  As it stands, though, I'll be avoiding TNN on 9/9/99.  You may want to rent it first to see if you can deal with it better than I, though.  -- Anoop Gantayat, who wants to drive a buggy through the streets of Milpitas.", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
