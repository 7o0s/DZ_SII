His career has spanned through professional sports, videos, music, a clothing line, and of course, video games. His Pro Skater series has revolutionized skateboarding in gaming, offering no fewer than seven iterations in just as many years, each with its own distinct flavor. The latest, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, managed to improve upon the series and was widely accepted as one of the best in the genre. Finally, after its initial release late in 2005, it has made its way to mobile and it turns out to be a title that doesn't defile its pedigree.   THAW follows the same path of its console counterpart, placing players in the shoes of a new arrival in the Los Angeles skating scene. Players must prove to the veterans of the area that they are a skater of merit by completing a series of goals across the handful of areas composing the game. The three areas available (the seedy looking Hollywood, beach front Santa Monica, and the skate park ingeniously dubbed Skate Ranch), though limited, manage to keep things interesting.   When you first fire things up, the game seems deceiving, with the only ollies and kickflips available in your grab bag of tricks. As you get further into the game, you're walked through how to perform other maneuvers such as manuals, transfers and grinds. These basic tricks manage to add to what the game has to offer, allowing for strings of combos that help keep the games appeal relatively high, considering that it was made to be played in short bursts.   As you achieve goals (along the lines of getting X amount of points in a single grind combo), you unlock a few tricks to add to your repertoire which, once again, help you chain together high-point chains. Though, it must be said that despite the simplicity of the goals, things can be rather vague when it comes to a specific location you need to be while meeting the objective you're assigned and can easily result in some frustration, but all it takes is some trial and error to figure things out.    When you complete your goals, you'll find that the tricks that can be unlocked are rather sparse -- with only Christ Air, 50-50 Grind and Wallies forming up the list -- though they do add an extra flair, keeping players enthralled with the gameplay. The Christ Air in particular, manages to be the most visually impressive trick in the game, with the character's arms splayed wide, accurately mimicking the trick from the real world.   The gameplay itself is fairly solid, with directional controls assigned to either the directional pad or the 2, 4, 8 and 6 buttons on your keypad. The 5 key as well as the ~OK~ button are used for ollies and heelflips, with the rest of the keys on the numerical pad assigned out to the other tricks available. The animations in this title are also fairly impressive, with your character pushing, jumping and performing his tricks rather fluidly as you make your way through the miniature version of Los Angeles.  Though its not up to par with something like the DOOM RPG having both style and substance, THAW does have a few things to offer. It looks great, it plays well enough and it provides enough fun when played in short bursts, but it doesnt do anything to transcend above average. Whether youre a fan of Mr. Hawks work, or if youre just curious how this mobile game plays, Tony Hawks American Wasteland may be worth your while.", "date": "Mar 11, 2006"}
