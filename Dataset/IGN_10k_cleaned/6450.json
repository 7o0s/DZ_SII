I was none too surprised to discover that THQ Wireless was cooking up SpongeBob Squarepants Baytona 500, a an itty-bitty kart racer starring the most famous citizens of Bikini Bottom. The endeavors are risky, because so much of their appeal relies on a potential purchaser's interest in the license. Really, how many people ran out and bought Antz Racing?   Well, I confess I have a soft spot for the license -- but not the title character. Just looking at SpongeBob's dim comrade Patrick is enough to make me chuckle. That dude is so dumb, but his childlike earnestness keeps him from being a total rube. And that you can race as Patrick -- as well as several other key characters -- in Baytona 500 helped fuel some initial good will toward the game.   The plot is minor. The evil Plankton is holding this rally race to keep everybody busy long enough for him to pilfer the Krabby Patty recipe. When you play the game's Story Mode, which is surprisingly brisk, you'll see quick static cutscenes that advance the yarn inch by inch. I played the game on an LG VX7000, which has a decent-sized screen, but the font used makes the words difficult to read sometimes. I know the font is appropriate for show, but it's just unpleasant to look at.   Baytona 500 consists of only a scant three tracks, two of which you'll burn through right quick. The AI of the other drivers is pretty weak, and if you can just stay behind the lines for the majority of the race, you'll leave them in the dust. However, on the third track, it seemed like everybody remembered which pedal did what -- and completed some racing school while I was reading about Plankton. Now Sandy is making expert turns and whizzing out into the distance, whereas before I blazed by her with little difficulty, never to see her again.    The tracks are littered with bonus power-ups, as expected. An anchor trades your position with whomever is in first place. An iceberg encases the other racers in ice, impeding their progress. A Krabby Patty offers a quick burst of speed. It's all basic fare, hidden inside treasure chests strewn about the course. They are often positioned on the edges of the lane, though, so you have to steer out of the way to get them, potentially risking a speed bump into the coral rails.   Baytona 500 certainly looks the part of a SpongeBob racer. All of the characters are present in unique little karts. The backdrops look like they were lifted from the show. The game only plays a quick rendition of the theme at the main menu before falling silent. I was hoping for maybe some short voice clips -- even SpongeBob's infectious laugh would have been cool.  The intended audience has to be taken into consideration when judging the ease and of Baytona 500. The game wasn't necessarily made for me, even if I do kinda like the show. It's a streamlined racer with only three tracks (six, if you count the reverse runs) and no difference between the racers, stat-wise. If you have a younger player around that likes the characters and wants a simple encounter with them, Baytona 500 isn't a bad pick -- but just be prepared for them to burn through it quickly.", "date": "Dec 1, 2005"}
