After games such as Ace Combat 4, Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil, and Time Crisis 2, you'd think that some other game, one with millions of polygons and super incredible action with blast processing and neural networks would explode from Namco's R&D departments back in Japan. But no, there is no such thing coming from Namco. Well, at least not now. Right now, at the birth the most powerful consoles on Earth, Namco is delivering its earth shattering, mind-blowing, eye-peeling Namco Museum. Boom.   Have you recovered from the blow? The severe polygonal madness? I thought not. Don't worry. We're sort of over the whole ~everything has to be new~ philosophy, and we've settled down into a kind of ~if it's fun, we'll play it~ mode... But now that I think of it more carefully, we've really kind of slunk down into a  ~Thank God the biggest onslaught of games that have ever been foisted upon mankind is over~ mode, if you get my drift. And so, after being reinstated to the land of the living, it's quite nice to surface to the happy smiling faces of Pac-Man, Dig-Dug and beeping, quirky arcade games that I ground my teeth on when I was in junior high school.   If you haven't already figured out, Namco Museum is sort of an onomatopoeia; it practically describes itself. The package is a collection of classic old Namco arcade games and every single one of them plays just like it used to in the arcades. Really. In fact, they also look just like they did in the arcades, too. They're great old games, as far as they go.   Gameplay It's not like Namco hasn't done this before. There were like 7 billion Namco Museums on PlayStation, and we reckon there will be more from Namco on PS2 in the future. So yes, this particular Namco collection is a solid one, packing a great assortment of some very old arcade games. The grand list includes:   Pac-Man Pac-Man Arrangement  Galaga Galaga Arrangement Dig Dug Dig Dug Arrangement Pole Position Pole Position II Ms. Pac-Man Galaxian Pac-Attack Pac-Mania   Of the 10 games available upon booting up, three make their premiere console debut -- the arranged versions of Pac-Man, Galaga and Dig Dug. These titles made it into the arcades, but until now, they've never been ported to a home console. In addition to the first 10 games, there are also two classic games that you can unlock by scoring more than 25,000 points in Pac-Man and 20,000 points in Ms. Pac-Man -- Pac-Attack and Pac-Mania.   The game code from each classic has been ported unperturbed from its original form onto PS2, and weird things found in the originals, such as the ability to pass randomly through ghosts in Pac-Man and touching the pixel of another Pole Position car blowing your car to pieces, are still alive and kicking in this unblemished port.   What I can say about these games that hasn't already been described by dozens of writers in the past 20 years? Not much, But what I can say in earnest is that these games right here are the foundations of today's games, and that they still absolutely remain vital, the definition of arcade fun.   Pac-man still drives to me reach for quarters in my pocket, and Pole Position is still a game of precision and instinct. Ms. Pac-man is still my favorite because of its bouncing-walking fruit, and Dig-Dug is still ridiculously hard after the sixth level. In short, these games are based entirely on skill, and their bare-bones approach is something to pay attention to as we enter into this new phase of next-generation games. Each game is great in its own right, but all 10-plus form a sweet package that serves as a reminder of the industry's origins, but even more significantly, that games are all about having fun. Namco Museum is a light-hearted assortment games that don't grate on your intellect, and every so often, well, it's nice to just kick back and eat taffy and popcorn instead of steak and potatoes.   Does the game have any problems? Being picky with this game is sort of ridiculous, since there is no real way to compare them to any contemporary games, but it there can always be improvements. Why can't Namco make a super clean, polygonal, shiny new Pac-Man game, using the same patterns of the first? Or even less work might be this suggestion -- why not just clean up the first one a little?   Other then that, the games are entirely intact, which means that even the ~cutscenes~ of Pac-Man being chased by the ghosts, and Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man chasing each other cannot be skipped. I found myself trying to skip through the cut-scenes but couldn't. A collection of Pac-man memorabilia or the history of Pac-man could have been included to educate new gamers to the rather long history of Pac-Man, it's origins, etc. Oh yeah, playing Pole Position isn't quite the same without using the steering wheel. It's still good, but the steering wheel was quite wonderful.   Graphics Um...Well, hm...I uh...no...  Kind of a hard sell, these graphics...So, let's put it this way, Namco Museum doesn't make use of the PlayStation 2's power, in even the most remote sense, and there aren't really too many polygons or textures to push, so that leaves us with one good thing, fast load times! Yea!   Visually, every single game you played (or didn't, as the case may be) in the arcade in the '80s looks exactly like it did then. Namco added a little feature to enlarge the screen, too, which is nice, but hardly a graphic enhancement.   In the most real sense, these games aren't about graphics. They're about gameplay. Period.   Sound Miss that old sound of Pac-man and its four notes clanging away for hours on end? Or how about the lovely sound of the Pole Position woman saying, ~Prepare to quality~? How about the low quality sounds of electronic sounds beeping and squeaking and squawking? Well, now you don't have to worry anymore! The music from each game is exactly the same as they were before, simplistic, electronic, totally unrealistic and even funny at times. But then again, what's more wondrous than the start-up sounds of Dig-Dug?   After that, the music is really just what it is, good, simple stuff. It's not Mozart, and we're thankful for that. These songs are nice and breezy, light and still able to bring a smile to this journalist's face. The only problem is that the sound production is terribly weak. The start-up sound of the PlayStation 2 is clearer and louder than the sounds from these games at the same volume level.This is a great collection of games and their additional arrangements, and in other cases, sequels, that still represent some of the beast arcade games of their day. They're still fun, but they definitely aren't pretty. Considering that Namco Museum isn't going for the standard price, this collection is quite an inviting bargain. Going for the suggested retail price of $29.99, you're paying about 10 quarters per classic game, and that's a bargain in today's $49.99 per game pricing market. If you like arcade games, and you don't already own all of these games (or haven't downloaded them off the Internet), Namco is giving you another chance.", "date": "Dec 7, 2001"}
