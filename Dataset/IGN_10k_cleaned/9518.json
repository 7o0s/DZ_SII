I'm happily recommending it to gamers of all skill levels, as this has something for everybody. Total casuals will enjoy just bopping bear with dive-bombing penguins. Hardcore mobile gamers will go for three stars on each level and enjoy playing the strategy game, too. And everybody will love the humor. Download it.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
