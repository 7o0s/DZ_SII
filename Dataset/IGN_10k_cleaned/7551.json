It offered a splendid mix of addictive gameplay and infectious tunes. For a while, it sat proudly atop the rest of its PSP brethren as the best of the best. No other puzzler came close. Ever since then, developer Q Entertainment has planned to outdo itself, primarily with the direct sequel to Lumines, titled Lumines II. But it also has other titles in development craving their own time in the spotlight.   One of these games, titled Every Extend Extra, offers a wholly different experience. Where Lumines and its sequel adhere to the basic Tetris formula, Every Extend Extra is an action puzzle hybrid. It plays a lot like an arcade title in that regard, only it offers an experience far deeper than the average twitch fest. A player needs to think ahead and plan every move and motion, not just run in guns blazing. Do that and it's curtains in a matter of seconds in Every Extend Extra. So what kind of puzzle game actually lets a player go in guns blazing? Not many, but this one certainly does. Though it's closer to running in with bombs blazing, since Every Extend Extra is all about explosions.    Players actually control a little ship, which actually looks more like a three-dimensional compass. They move it around with the thumbstick and detonate it when close to enemy ships. The goal is to create massive chain reactions. It's not as easy as it sounds. In order to set off a reaction encompassing 40-plus detonations requires a decent amount of skill. But that's where a majority of the satisfaction and depth sits in Every Extend Extra. Having said that, this is where most of the frustration sits, too. As awesome as forming these screen-sweeping explosions can be, Every Extend Extra will brutalize any gamer who can't ascend its learning curve. Anyone can jump in and play for a while, but it takes patience and skill to make it through just half of the game's nine stages.   Nine stages may not sound like a lot, and truthfully, it's not. But for some cosmic reason it satisfies nonetheless. Each one provides such a distinct arena, complete with unique musical tracks and background animations, that moving through the game gives players an actual sense of accomplishment. Each stage also comes with mini-bosses and full-on boss encounters, too, which require players to form chain reactions of a specific count. It's a lot of fun to do so, though the difficulty ramps up incredibly fast. First, a boss calls for a string of five, then a string of 12 and then a string of 30, and so on. Not only that, each boss (and mini-boss) squirts out little balls of energy that make the player's ship explode into a thousand pieces.  Which brings up another point: time. Each stage in Every Extend Extra has a strict time limit. Like everything else in the game, it's a source of frustration and exhilaration. The time constraints force a novice player to jet around wildly, which inevitably ends in death, but seasoned players know just how to maximize every second. Until a player finds himself in the seasoned camp, managing time is a serious pain in the ass. The game would be challenging without the time limit, but asking players to increase their time by killing specific enemies lends yet another layer of depth and strategy to the mix. So yes, it blatantly sucks at first, but doing things quickly (and effectively) makes it a better experience in the end.    In addition to the main Arcade mode, players also get a Boss Rush mode, which stacks every boss encounter one on to of the other. There's also Caravan mode, which presents completed stages for the choosing ~a la carte~ so players can just play their favorites. There's also multiplayer mode, which is as fun, stressful and addicting as the main game. Plus, there's this extra layer of competition. Setting off huge chain reactions adversely affects the opposing player - much like what happens in every competitive puzzle game. It's great fun and a groovy addition to the rest of the game.   Every Extend Extra does a fine job of mixing arcade action with the depth of a serious puzzle game. It could use more stages, not to mention a greater range of difficulty modes, but these complaints fail to make the game any less appealing. Throw in a collection of catchy tunes and trippy visuals, and Every Extend Extra provides just about everything a puzzle fan could want.", "date": "Nov 10, 2006"}
