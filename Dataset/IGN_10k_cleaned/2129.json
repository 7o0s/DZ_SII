It's obvious that the team learned a thing or two when bringing that game to life on the handheld, as the Game Boy Advance's first web-swingin' adventure is similarly impressive -- Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace is an excellent action game that does a great job of capturing the feel of the Marvel Comics superhero on the portable system. Features Multiple locations Non-linear adventure Multiple Spidey-suit power-ups Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  Seems there's been a series of seemingly unrelated events late at night that Spider-Man needs to investigate -- Rhino's out at the docks creating a little mayhem, Hammerhead's causing a scuffle in the downtown area, and Big Wheel...well, he's just being mean and destroying a factory. Though the game tries its best to keep the plot a secret, if you can't figure out who's behind all this hoo-ha you really need to get out for some fresh air. I mean, cripes, they named it Mysterio's Menace for some reason, right...?  The entire game's been laid out in non-linear fashion -- at the beginning you're free to go find out what either of the three bad guys are up to, and since the three ~adventures~ branch out into multiple levels, you're free to leap back and forth between adventures once a level has been complete. Since you assume the role of Spider-Man, you've got a whole arsenal of techniques at the ready, and each level has been laid out so that you'll get to use every ounce of your spider strength. External cityscape levels put your web-swinging abilities to use (as simple as pulling off a double-jump in most platformers), and more structured, inside areas require a lot more use of your wall crawling. Our hero can also punch and kick bad guys while on the floor, or clung to a wall or ceiling, as well as fire some webfluid netting or bullets to make the hand-to-hand combat a bit easier...especially when you've got bad guys that favor their tommy guns instead of their fists.  Level designs have been structured with a bit of variety as well. Some levels simply require you to get Spider-Man from one end of the ~world~ to the other, while others have a sort of quota to complete...case in point, the Dance Club level where you'll have to go from room to room searching for hostages to rescue. And the city map indicates when you've left hidden goodies behind, so you'll have to take up the challenge and find what you've missed by redoing some completed levels to snag the treats. Spider-Man is definitely one of the prettiest action titles on the system. Backgrounds are near photo-realistic with multiple layers of scrolling to give off an excellent perception of depth. Spider-Man and Co. have been prerendered with literally hundreds of frames of animation, giving each sprite a detailed look to their motions. My one complaint in the animation comes from the fact that it doesn't feel ~extreme~ enough when putting an enemy to the canvas...as smooth as most of the animation is, knocking out a bad guy looks a bit too clumsy when he crumbles into a heap and flickers away.  In fact, most of my complaints come from the up-close combat...it just doesn't seem polished enough. It's all about mashing the button when in tight against an enemy, instead of letting the gamer pull off a cool little multi-hit combo to take him out.   Vicarious Visions was also responsible for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the Game Boy Advance, which means these guys definitely have the code and connections for some excellent tunes using the system hardware. The music is a definite high point in Spider-Man, and it's used to set the mood well in most of the levels. In fact, it's a bit interactive as well, as shown in the Dance Club level where the looping techno is muffled outside the club, but completely blaring when inside. It's very a cool effect. This is another overall excellent game design from Vicarious Visions. It's not as technically amazing as the company's first GBA project (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2), but it's impressive all the same. A few tweaks in the hand-to-hand combat would have eliminated the somewhat clumsy feel in the controls, but this just encourages the use of the more distant fighting capabilities. Overall, though, the game captures the proper feel of the webhead, and it's definitely the best side-scrolling action game starring the classic Marvel superhero.", "date": "Sep 27, 2001"}
