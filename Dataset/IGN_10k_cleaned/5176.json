Before you frantically wave the Rainbow Studios flag of vengeance above your head, know that the Englishmen and women behind that acclaimed Xbox racer have definitely done this series justice. Offroad Fury 3 is easily the best ATV racer in existence and it also represents a sizeable, appreciated step forward for the franchise and online console gaming in general.   Before you get to trouncing friends and enemies over the Internet, you're probably going to want to look at the game itself. If you do, you'll first notice the new graphics engine and how it resembles the original two in terms of overarching style and aesthetic fundamentals. There are a lot of differences, but they're small. Fury 3 now offers up more richly detailed, cluttered environments in addition to wonderfully articulated ATVs and riders and more environmental interactivity than before. It's a showcase of polish and fluidity over any single, unnecessarily spectacular effect (though we are quite fond of the dust plumes).   The differences don't stop at eye candy, Offroad Fury 3 also feels somewhat different than before. Again, it's not one big drastic change that unexpectedly punches you in the back of the head, but rather a collection of very subtle taps. The physics, for starters, make the ATVs feel heavier and lighter (depending on what you're riding). The wheels now seem to grip and grind into the Earth with a bit more weight than before. Rebounds and off target lands are also more predictable -- more logical. And, interaction with roadside hazards like picket fences and boundary stacks do not imply instant deaths. This time around the ATVs don't always hit impenetrable walls; they now move through what they should be able to move through depending on speed and approach vector. In general, it's a more grounded, believable experience (though nothing comes close to snagging a tree limb in real life and wheeling off to one side).   Drawing Far  Even though these changes have been put in place, it's still a game that focuses on the sense of speed and emphasizes strategically tight cornering while distributing rider weight to preload and time jumps. Because of this, ATV appeals to a certain type of gamer who will remain happy thanks to the series constants that have been kept (jumping, land, careening through bends, try not to crash). Now, it may seem that the casual gamer is getting a bit of a nod in the form of the new powerslide maneuver, but that just isn't the case. It's still a game for a certain type.  By holding R1 in turns it's possible to whip around corners quicker, while potentially losing balance and ultimately a few seconds if you don't do it in the right place at the right time. Don't think of this as a Need for Speed influenced drift. It's actually implemented in such a way that its use isn't mandatory, and its effectiveness is not a prerequisite of success. In fact, if you watch all the movies we've thus far assembled, you probably won't even know when we're powersliding.   Powersliding isn't the only bit of new to Offroad Fury's gameplay. This time expect some brains. Yes, there have been some AI advancements, meaning the computer doesn't always try to land on your damn head in the more challenging races even if it means screwing itself over royally. Don't worry though, this is still a title that's easy enough for the casual gamer to get into right away, but difficult enough so that later on, only the avid player who is willing to contend with some trial and error will be successful. It's not generally that bad, but at times the level of trial and error in some of the freestyle objectives that require you tool around searching for green and red icons in specific timeframes is pretty ridiculous.  The whole point to playing through all this and ranking and performing linking combo tricks to earn credits is to unlock new stuff (you purchase just about everything in ATV with earned credits). Unlockables include tracks (40 of 'em across six terrain types), music videos (taken from a pool of around 30 licensed artists and about 35 songs), ATVs, and parts.      While we're not talking about the most complete collection of specific ATVs and equipment, Offroad Fury 3 tosses out enough authenticity so that avid and casual ATV riders will be able to recognize some favorite names. In the game you'll see brands like AC Racing, Trinity Racing, Curtis Sparks Racing, Trenga Racing, Alba, Duncan Racing, K&K ATV, Lonestar Racing, Nac's Racing, CT Racing.com, FMF, ITP, and more. Don't expect Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Shoei, or real racers, but there is enough realism to make moving through the upgrading process more enjoyable than the conventionally underdeveloped ~niche title.~ There's just so much to configure. The game offers options for just about everything including shocks, exhausts, fenders, logos, colors, riders, goggles, tires, wheels, foot rests... It's bananas.  Even if you don't care about singleplayer, you're going to need to play through a lot of the championships if you want to do some serious splitscreen racing. While the game offers both vertical and horizontal modes of splitscreen play, it doesn't immediately come with everything unlocked. To really enjoy the game with friends you have to pay your dues in the singleplayer modes. For splitscreen play there are perhaps too many locked components, but the extra incentive to win more credits to unlock more of those goodies makes playing solo that much more enjoyable.  All of this isn't just for face-to-face competition, of course. The biggest allure of ATV is clearly the online component. Six-player online gaming is engaging, but the big draw comes from customization and rankings. Climax really put a great deal of effort into the online arena, with racing modes that are every bit as polished and balanced as the singleplayer game, and new mini-games (ranging in value) add a substantial amount of immediate gratification to the title.   Lean, Punk  It's hard to comment on the stability and performance of the network at this point, given that the bulk of the players ready to buy-in to ATV don't even have that option yet, but everything we have played has thus far been smooth and lag-free, but still somewhat dependent on the connections of those we played with. Regardless of that, the amount of presentational consideration that has been applied to Fury is nothing short of astounding for a console title. We have a game that supports the headset, incorporates message boards, chat rooms, instant messaging, and even boasts a functional stat tracker and clan-based play. It's the complete package. As if that weren't enough, Sony and Climax promise full hard drive support that doesn't stop at the enduro tracks players can set their own waypoints on. They imply that anything from new parts to new ATVs to new tracks to new riders are all coming down the pipe. With all of that, ATV 3 will keep its fan base happy for a very, very long time.  Offroad Fury 3 is an extremely well done, but narrowly appealing racing title. It's a very specific kind of game that will appeal to a very specific kind of gamer. To that person, please look no further. The buck has stopped. For everyone else expecting something that is not Offroad Fury simply because it is not being done by Rainbow anymore, you are out of luck.If you're looking for a natural extension of the series, you've found it. Buy ATV 3 and be happy.", "date": "Oct 28, 2004"}
