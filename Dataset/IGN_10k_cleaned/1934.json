So you'd be safe to assume that playing a game like Robot Arena is not only an entertaining concept, but educational. Robotic survival will be the next decade's Furby, so it's good to encourage your love ones and relatives to bone up on the ways of robot-related destruction. Only send them towards the TV screen and Robot Wars instead. Robot Arena takes the fun concept of fighting customizable robots and somehow turns it into tedium.  It'll trick you though. The first few minutes spent building your first low-budget robot will get you excited about the battles ahead. You'll be able to choose from wheel bases (rubber, tread, exposed or under-chassis metal), armor, weapons and accessories, ranging from the cheap to the life of the rich and robotic. Axes, battering rams, giant hammers, moveable saw blades and harpoon guns are just a few of the weapons you can choose from. Each chassis has a set of points that any of these weapons can be attached to, so you can do cool things like pick a round chassis and fit it with a myriad of saw blades, or pick a shovelnosed chassis and make a pair of axes that slam towards each other like insect pincers. With enough money you can pick bigger and better gadgets, like a radio jammer that stops the opponent robot from moving, more powerful batteries to power your weapons, or maybe just some speakers to spout threatening gibberish at your opponents.   You'll be able to choose from a practice match with no stakes, or a tournament match where you'll win cash prizes, or if you lose, have to spend hard-earned cash to rebuild your robot after a butt-slamming. There's also a custom mode where you can match up against a variety of opponents in the arena of your choice, in either a flag battle or a deathmatch. Unfortunately, once you get beyond the selection screens you'll find yourself in rough territory. There are only seven levels to the tournament game, and the first five are filled with AI so ridiculously stupid that it you'd have to be playing this game while trying to cook dinner and overdosing on Demoral just to lose a match. Enemy robots have a tendency to pull fantastic tricks like standing still, or driving into a wall, with small spurts of intelligence. You'll usually be able to destroy every robot by simply wheeling around to a side without smashing weapons, and using a hammer or an axe to take out its compressors, or weaponry. Then it's a sitting duck. You can literally repeat this task and win each battle in under a minute. If you didn't spend time using your earning to rework your vehicle, you'd easily be able to beat the tournament version in about fifteen minutes, give or take. The custom mode doesn't help the situation either, since you're very limited in how you can customize battles. Sure you can mix up where you can fight bots, and how long the fight is, but it certainly isn't the same as putting together a five bot free for all, or tweaking the intelligence of your opponents by any means.  As an online game there are more possibilities, obviously, though without real server connections the fun is pretty limited. Even if you get a one on one game going with some real life opponents, you'll realize that while it's fun, it's definitely no Quake. Cool as giant saws may be, when you're only going two miles an hour, the shock value and shlock value quickly fades. File this under the ~better in real life~ section.  While it's prettier than most budget titles, it also suffers from the vacancy that so often comes with nice looking people, dogs, or mechanical monsters. It looks great standing still, but give it a complicated task and it all goes to pieces. The graphics and sounds are solid for a budget title, especially the nice metal thud of an axe hitting a chassis, and go beyond what you can expect for an average budget title. While not brilliant, they're certainly playable, and pretty clean -- that is, until you hit some of the incredibly bad bugs with the graphics. Textures will stretch in bizarre ways at random moments, textures will take on different properties, and things will generally freak out at times for no apparent reason. Not to mention the fact that the game just flat out crashed completely on me at least five times.  Perhaps that's just the point. Maybe robots made this game as just the first step in their plans to conquer earth, through a mixture of boredom and insanity, and an attempt to lighten our feelings on the whole ~robots with giant axes and blades~ issue. If they can't even aim right, or avoid spikes in an arena, then how can they take over the planet? In that case, Robot Arena does exactly what it set out to do. I obey you, lord and masters, and I give up. I will never try to build evil saw monsters again, unless it's at your bidding.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
