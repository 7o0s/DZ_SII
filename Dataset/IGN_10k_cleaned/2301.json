This won't turn into a movie review, but I have to say that the overall story is very clever and extremely kid-friendly, and with Potter-mania sweeping the world, it's not a surprise that a company jumped on the wagon quickly to produce a bazillion videogame renditions before the reels showed up in theaters. But while I honestly can't say for sure that the Game Boy Advance version of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone feels ~rushed~ to meet the movie premiere, it definitely feels a bit hollow. The game's a solid shell, but the designers didn't fill it with the chewy substance that makes it enjoyable. Features More than 20 characters Collect Chocolate Frog cards and Bertie Bott's Beans Battery save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  If you're looking for an accurate representation of the book or the film, you got it. The Game Boy Advance adventure picks up when Harry Potter enters his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, following almost every important detail of the story's exploits. The troll ~invasion~, the Quiddich match, the earning of House Points...it's all here.  The Game Boy Advance version is distinctly different from the Game Boy Color version also released, as this edition is more of a adventure/puzzle game than the GBC's RPG design. And while the Game Boy Advance has more potential in bringing the Potter story to life in a fun game, the development team sort of stumble around with redundant ~shove items around~ gameplay that gets old pretty quickly...and it's unfortunately a majority of the game's design.  See, every time Harry goes to class, he learns a skill...and that skill is put to the task in a puzzle environment where he must locate a set number of a specific item. The first spell you learn is ~Filipendo~ (which sounds like ~Nintendo!~ through Harry's digitized English accent), and this spell shoots a magic ball and pushes items away from where you shot it. These levels are very similar to the Golden Sun ~log shoving~ puzzles or the ~block shoving~ puzzles in nearly every existing Zelda game...but where they're few and far between in these games, in Harry Potter, it's all over the place. To add variety to these challenges, the developers included a Metal Gear type series of levels when Harry needs to escape his dormitory at night. These rounds are clever but a bit wonky as well, since it's tough to tell where each of the characters' line-of-sight begin and end...you can be standing two pixels away from one teacher without being seen, but another teacher might see you from a good half screen distance. And this glitchiness doesn't stop at these night-time levels, as the collision detection is really strange when falling off a ledge or getting hit by a creature or thorn. When battling the huge Troll, the game showed the big guy falling into a well, but he was a good step or two away from plummeting. These weird hiccups seem to show that the development team didn't have enough time to give the game its needed polish before release.  Even the Quiddich match isn't as exciting as it could have been. Oh, it's good fun for what it is, but it's really basic and it also suffers from the same collision detection problems as the rest of the game. During these Nimbus 2000 levels, players control Harry in an overhead perspective, similar to racing games such as Micromachines -- the task is to chase after the super-fast Snitch and grab it before the other team's Seeker grabs it. As Harry gets closer to it, the action zooms in closer so it becomes a Seeker vs. Seeker battle for the snitch. But oddly enough, when playing this level for the first time, I grabbed the snitch even when it was a good two broomstick lengths away. It was a very awkward instance, absolutely. What's disappointing about this level is that the developer could have incorporated the Quiddich Match to use the GBA's abilities a bit more ambitiously. The match was one of the most exciting scenes in the film, but in the game, it's merely routine.  The one thing the developers got right in the Game Boy Advance version of Harry Potter is the graphics, or at least the individual character animations. Each sprite has been rendered with incredible fluidity, and they all look like their theatrical counterpart -- Harry looks as good as he can get on the Game Boy Advance's limited resolution, as his trademark round spectacles are easily recognizable on the little guy's face.  Even the underplayed characters get a decent walk cycle; it's almost as if the artists actually digitized Alan Rickman in his deadpan stroll for his game representation. But what sort of goes a little screwy is the actual camera perspective; the game's viewpoint is at an overhead location, but objects and sprites are drawn as if they're in a strictly horizontal-scrolling environment. It's nitpicky to mention, but sometimes an old optical illusion happens that makes it difficult to tell where on the path some objects are sitting.   I'll give the developers credit...they followed the story quite well in this Game Boy Advance rendition. But the actual game design lacks the plot's originality, as it depends on basic ideas to drive the adventure for hours. And some of the levels just go on way too long without a place to save the game in progress -- falling off a ledge during a challenge is a real drag since you have to start from the beginning of the puzzle...even if you've spent more than 20 minutes performing all the necessary tasks. Kids will probably enjoy it because of its true-to-the-book design, but that doesn't grant it a ~fun game~ status. Four points deducted from House Electronic Arts!", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
