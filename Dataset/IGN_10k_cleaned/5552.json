Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the Monkey Island series, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and others. I've also played my fair share of game that didn't quite hit the mark. While The Moment of Silence isn't a bad game, it has several design decisions that prevent it from being recommended to anyone outside the dwindling genre fanbase.   Things start out well enough, with a pleasingly cinematic and polished pre-rendered intro movie. It doesn't do a lot to set the stage, which may be good or frustrating, depending on your tastes. I think a little more information would be helpful, since we've jumped forty years into the future, and the sociopolitical landscape has changed dramatically. MoS begins in New York City, where personal transportation has been outlawed and huge flatscreen TVs advertise some kind of propaganda. Unfortunately, it's an amazingly depopulated city, with only a handful of pedestrians standing motionless in a given urban location, and a grand total of two people in the park across from the main character's apartment. The world feels disappointingly static.   The graphics are solid but a little dated, combining some 3D elements within well-designed 2D scenes. I have no complaints about the art, but the character models are stiffly animated, kind of blocky, and they don't lip synch very well. During some of the staggeringly long conversations you can have, a given character might just stand and stare at the wall or through the window the entire time, appearing in the exact same location no matter how many times or how many days later you return.   And despite the unbelievable amount of dialogue, I learned more about this future world from the intro blurb in the manual than I did from the first several hours of playing the game. It could have been because my eyes were glazing over constantly. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting is generally quite acceptable and the dialogue consistently interesting and mostly lively. I just can't bring myself to care about the intimate details of a world that technologically doesn't look that much different from my own. But you have to go through all available conversation trees to trigger the ability to access further areas of the game. And sometimes a discussion in one conversation branch will open up a new question in another branch, forcing you to move back and forth until you're absolutely sure you've exhausted all available options.   For example: Early in the game, I have to take some time off from work to investigate a mystery. Sadly, I can't simply zip over to my workplace and talk to my boss. I have to establish progress in uncovering parts of the mystery first, even though what I establish at that point has nothing to do with what I need to do at work at that point. In order to establish progress, I have to dig through a load of conversation options with somebody, trade an item I don't initially have on me and is relatively difficult to obtain with the game's awkward interface, then take the new item to a person whom I had no particular reason to believe would be able to answer my questions, and click and drag this item from my inventory over to him, rather than the possession of this item opening up another dialogue option. The interface involves a disappointing amount of pixel hunting, interacts with objects and locations that serve no purpose other than to just be there (a table scattered with food, a desk drawer with a few disks in it, a window looking down on the street, et cetera).   Having to click-and-drag an item over to someone to trigger an event means having to do this every time with everything you own, just to make sure you haven't accidentally missed one of those arbitrary progress points. No to mention calling everyone listed in your messenger phone. As your location options branch out, you'll have to endure hopping back and forth across several spots, to find that one person to click-and-drag that one item to, or to pore over the area yet again to make sure the feeble camera system hasn't been preventing you from seeing a specific street corner or park bench.     There's also a lot of travel space in the game, and Peter, the main character, jogs painfully slowly. There's also a lot scenes where you have to sit and watch while a character laboriously makes his way from point A to point B. What's the purpose of making me watch Juan walk down the street after trading my messenger for a console? Why do I have to watch Bill go all the way into the kitchen before I can access the upload console? The movement speed, exhaustive dialogue, and forced observance combine to pad the game from somewhat long-winded to badly in need of a copy editor. Movement is also complicated by a sometimes confusing pathing system, where there's apparently a hard-coded route from one of a given room to the other. In Peter's apartment, for example, if you walk over to the shelf and want to go to the computer, he walks away, past the bed, turns a 180, then walks to computer, which is a few feet away from the shelf. I also had the game lock up because I pushed the elevator button when I was only half-way down the hall.   Speaking of which, there are some animation sequences which are mildly interesting the first time but then grow annoying repetitive. For example, Peter lives on the 23rd floor of an apartment building. Whenever he gets in, you have to watch as the elevator makes its way through all 23 floors. It only takes a few seconds, but you'll be doing it a lot. You'll also be getting in and out of ~satcars~ a lot (the automated hovercar taxis that have replaced combustion cars). He walks up, reaches into his coat pocket, clicks a button on his PDA, puts the PDA back in his jacket, crawls in, the door slides closed, then you can get on with the game. Overall, there wasn't a lot of work done to cut down the boring travel sequences. Whenever you go to your workplace, you have to go through the lobby, which only serves as a plot element the first time. And you also have to get to the lobby from the satcar, and identify yourself at the door. Every single time. Why not just have the character show up at the office foyer when you want to visit his workplace?   There's an interesting story underneath the excessive dialogue, but it's a little too derivative. And if you accept the argument that science fiction's role is to explore how technology can affect our society--Alfred Bester, Philip K. Dick, William Gibson--then there's nothing to the central mystery that's unique enough to dedicate a game to, and precious little about the game that requires it to be set four decades in the future. This could easily be drawn from an X-Files idea, with its bountiful conspiracy theories and cynical attitude towards the government. So, since the futuristic setting isn't necessary to the story, it fails as a genre exercise.This is a much better game than a lot of things I've had to see come out of DreamCatcher/The Adventure Company, in terms of production values, voice acting quality, and story. Unfortunately, the mechanics are awkward and progress too tedious for anyone not already partly conditioned to the adventure genre's trappings. If you're already a fan of this stuff, you'll probably be able to tolerate MoS's shortcomings and find a rewarding experience underneath its issues. For the rest of us, however, the fun-to-frustration ratio puts it low on the gaming priority list.", "date": "Mar 4, 2005"}
