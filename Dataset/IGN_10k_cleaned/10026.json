EA Mobile's Harry Potter: Mastering Magic endeavors to revitalize the crowded genre with the popular license. The result is an attractive puzzle game that makes excellent use of Harry Potter, but the training events themselves are retreads of concepts that any fan of Brain Age or its ilk have already played many, many times.   Now, if you are completely new to the brain training genre, then Mastering Magic has considerable potential for you. You are Harry Potter, stuck in the middle of a semester at Hogwarts, studying up for a series of tests called OWLs. (Think SATs with eye of newt.) You play through a calendar of classes in various subjects, such as divination or spell casting. Each training has a magical theme, but the core is a basic puzzle, such as fitting shapes into a pattern, matching objects under a time limit, or basic arithmetic.    Again, if this is your first dip in the brain training well, you are sure to be entertained by all of this -- and doubly so if you are a Potter fan. But the field has been saturated at this point and EA Mobile's game suffers because of this.   Here's a very specific example: In a potions class, you must keep track of the number of each ingredient dropped into a bubbling cauldron. At the end of the test, you're asked how many of a specific ingredient made it. I have played at least a dozen variations on this in Brain Age, Big Brain Academy, and several mobile brain training games, such as Brain Juice. It's just not new to me, so I found my interest faltering after a couple laps through the puzzles. I think a lot of gamers well versed in these games will feel the same way.   Mastering Magic does include a pass-the-phone multiplayer feature that lets you challenge nearby friends. It's a nice addition.   What cannot be disputed, though, are the production values. Mastering Magic sounds fantastic. I played the game on an LG VX8300 and some very recognizable Potter themes strongly blared from the speakers. The visuals are ultra-clean and colorful, such as the dragon-dominated math contest or the sparkling skies of the constellation-completing minigame. The actors from the movie lend their likeness here, too, so you'll see Harry, Ron, and other popular characters appear throughout the entire game. All games could use more Maggie Smith.Happy Potter: Mastering Magic is an entirely playable brain training game, but it brings nothing new to the genre. Instead, it is a finely polished example of the category. Newcomers will get a lot more out of it than veterans, as will hardcore Potter fanatics. However, if you've already played one or two brain trainers, you'll find your noggin largely treading water here.", "date": "Feb 14, 2008"}
