The good news is that no one will be saying that about QBC this year. That's because, and this is the bad news in case you're wondering, there's so many things wrong with the basic look and feel of this game that most of the wonderful improvements we expected this time around are lost in the confusion. In fact, the improvements are probably in the same place as the frames of animation that are missing from QBC 2000. We liked a lot of the innovations this game has brought to the world of football videogames, but due to poor execution of actual gameplay, the basis for any sports game, these innovations have yet to be fully realized.  The Features:  New player models will feature even more detailed faces, eye black, elbow pads and finger tape.  Running on an improved Quagmire engine. All 31 1999 NFL teams including the Cleveland Browns.  All 30 NFL stadiums rendered in full 3D. Full NFL license with over 1500 players. Overhauled artificial intelligence strategy courtesy of New York Jets Offensive Coordinator Charlie Weis.  Acclaim's All-New Pin-Point Passing system. Over 1200 new motion-captured animations for improved tackling and player celebration sequences.  Player attributes change to reflect game performance during season modes.  Total Team Management will have players drafting, trading, signing and releasing players in addition to managing the salary cap.  Players from the New York Jets served as motion capture models. Game announcing from ESPN's Mike Patrick and CBS' randy Cross. Real time field deterioration.  Team specific playbooks for all 31 teams.  Custom Creation tool allows you to create your own players and teams. Statistics include the all-new Acclaim Sports Power Rankings.  Season, Tournament, Playoffs, Pro Bowl and Exhibition game modes. Re-enact  key scenarios from all 33 Super Bowls.    Gameplay The framerate issue in QBC 2000 actually sparked a discussion around the IGN offices about why we often confuse speed with fluidity. When you command a player to run to the left, he may actually do it in a timely manner, but it looks slow because you're missing key frames of animation that would show the little guy's transition from whatever he was doing to running left. This is a huge fundamental problem with QBC 2000 that even Acclaim Studios Austin will admit to. The game's normally superb replay feature shows a lot more glitches and randomly misplaced or missing frames than fans of the QBC franchise will be used to. This of course means that all of the elements of gameplay can be hard to recognize and appreciate.   The passing game, traditionally the part that either makes or breaks a football game, is improved because of the new ~interactive~ pass catching system. No longer is it enough to call the right play, time the pattern perfectly and hit the open man. Now you've got to hit the all important catch button to begin the receiver's pass catching animation and time it so that his little paws are open just as the ball gets to him. This is different from the old Madden games on Genesis where you could just throw the ball up and time your  jump to make the catch. Even when your man is wide open and all alone, he'll watch countless footballs bounce off of him at all angles. This is a great idea in theory but because of the jumpy feel to the game you can't really see the ball floating into the receiver's hands and appreciate just what Acclaim was trying to do with this feature. Instead you just have to sort of fly blind and hit the catch button when you feel the ball is at the apex of its flight. You'll catch the ball the majority of the time if your man is open and you follow this rule. You still have to use the jump and dive buttons to make those respective catches in the right situations.   The A.I. is certainly improved on both sides of the ball. Charlie Weis knows what he's doing and it's been implemented fairly well in this game. There's not a lot of difference between the good and the bad teams as far as defensive and offensive play calling. Instead, it's more about the talent executing the plays that separates the Broncos from the Eagles for example.  And for those of you who were frustrated by the ~Quarterback Running Club~ of QBC '99, don't worry. QB's won't be running around as freely in this one as last year, they'll have to earn more of that yardage than before. Good running backs on the other hand seem to have inherited the superior stiff arming ability that the passers had from last year's game. Breaking a run to the outside is tough to do with aggressive linemen and linebackers coming at you, but if you get out there, you should be able to work well against the defensive backs.  There's also the new Pin-Point passing system to add to the passing game. However, we have to recommend avoiding this feature if you're a beginner since the conventional passing system is tough enough to work and keep track of with the jumpy animation and all. Pin-Point passing is supposed to allow the more advanced player to under and overthrow the receiver intentionally and rely on the individual quarterback and receiver skills to make the play. You snap the ball normally and then when you bring the passing tags up for each receiver you'll get a little display in the lower left corner that lets you determine the power and accuracy that you'll put on the pass. Using the live analog stick to control both the scrambling QB and the accuracy of the pass is a tough task so you'll have to be quick on the thumb. How long you hold down the button corresponding to your preferred receiver determines how hard you'll throw the ball and there's even a little power meter that moves up to show you just how much zip you're putting on it. Of course, you still have to take control of the receiver to make him catch the ball, so there can be quite a bit of button activity in a very short bit of time.  Again this is a fantastic idea that would give veteran players something to work on once they've mastered the conventional passing system but it's tough enough to just execute simple plays through all of the choppiness in the game.  The other big difference in QBC 2000 is the new use of the A button for ball carriers. There's no more turbo boost to speak of when you're running with the ball unless you count pushing all the way on the analog stick for maximum speed as turbo. Now the A button causes you to stop dead in your tracks so that you can use the analog stick to shift your weight and shoulders in a sort of create-a-juke function. You still get the conventional juke with the C-right button and all of the other ball carrier weapons like the stiff arm, hurdle, spin and dive. This isn't a bad idea but it'll take some reconditioning for gamers to avoid hitting A just as they break into the clear or try to turn the corner. The create-a-juke barely works well with even the very best running backs in the game. As quick and agile as Barry Sanders is, if you stop him and try to throw off the defense with a head fake, it's really tough to get him going again and you've just taken away his greatest weapon: speed. If you do decide to use your own juke, it'll have to be done with plenty of distance between you and the closest defender. Even on kick returns, though, no defensive player is going to react to a shoulder fake from 15 yards away, which is about how far away you need to be to do any kind of shaking and baking. Again you normally would want to the cool animations associated with all of the ball carrier's moves and shakes, but you'll miss a good number of the animation frames associated with the different moves.  We did like the variety of customization options available in the game. There's no create-a-play but there's a lot of other outlets for you to show off your football creativity. The custom playbook will let you save 250+ of your favorite plays to one playbook that you can load at anytime and use with any team. This is great for those of you who will want to discover and collect your favorite money plays. The create a player feature lets you do the standard stuff and assign your new guy a position, team and so forth. The really cool stuff begins with Custom Profile and Custom Team features. The custom profiles can be loaded at any time to any team in the game. The profile will give each team several tendencies such as favorite formations and sets to be used during games. You can determine how often a team uses the run versus the pass and even allows you to determine how likely a team is to use the big play in strange situations. This works for both offense and defense. The profiles can be loaded onto a computer opponent so that you can practice battling certain types of offenses and defenses with vary levels of aggressiveness. This is a great idea that basically lets you make the computer play smarter so that you'll get more of a challenge. You won't be picking plays for them, but you will notice them doing some crazy things if you give them a super aggressive profile.   Creating your own team is pretty fun because of all the options available to you. You pick the colors of helmets, pants, jersey and numbers for both home and away uniforms. You also pick the city, name, stadium, profiles and playbook but the cool part comes when it's time to fill out the roster. You can pick players from the free agent pool, any players you've created yourself or any of the 1500 past and present players represented in the game. This means you can build a team with Jerry Rice at receiver Dan Marino at quarterback, O.J. Simpson (he'll be referred to by number only)at running back and your customized stud at fullback.  This is a great feature even though the currently active players are the only one that will be referred to by name. Everyone else gets the old RB #32 designation.  Sound The sound of QBC is above average with superior announcing by Mike Patrick and Randy Cross. Their comments are timely and definitely add to the game. The only problem is that Patrick's play-by-play calls can sometimes kick in too late and you get a back log of commentary that trails 2-3 seconds behind the game action. Several times we threw passes that were dropped by receivers that were called ~outstanding~ catches by Patrick. By the time the commentary goes to the part where he says the pass was dropped (with the appropriate pain in his voice) the players would be almost back in the huddle. This reminded us of the old Sportstalk series of sports games on the Genesis that suffered from notorious backup on the play by play calls.  The crowds and stadium music are well done and timely and add some nice realism to the game. The referee, even though he looks a little sour, actually announces calls clearly and enforces the rules well. The music of the game doesn't take anything away from the experience but you wouldn't want to hear it at any other time of your life either.   Graphics If you can't tell already, we have some problems with the look of QBC 2000, but it's not all bad.  The details of the player are wonderful right down to the ~Riddell~ written on every helmet. The faces of the different players are clearly visible through the different facemasks and while they're not very animated, there is something powerful about being able to see the eyes of all your gridiron warriors. Also the fields of QBC 2000 are very accurate with the endzone and midfield logos done just as they are in real life. Even the Super Bowl logos from the historical simulations are perfect right down to the stars in the letters of Super Bowl III.  The problem is this game wasn't made just to take wonderful screenshots. Eventually the guys have to start moving and playing football and that's when the problems start. Let's put it this way: we all know that breaking into the open field means your player is running fast and ditching the defensive players, but the guy shouldn't be running faster because there's nobody else on the screen! That happens in QBC. When there are 22 players on the screen at once, as is the situation with most passing plays, the chop is extremely heavy and really makes this game a chore to play. Changing camera angles, including the cool custom cam that allows you to put the camera virtually anywhere, may help a little but you should be able to use the default QBC Action cam to get the most out of the game.  There were times in replays when we could see a player running normally down the sideline and as we slowed it to frame by frame, there would be random shots of the player doing things other than running down the field. Chris Calloway all of a sudden appeared to be leaping in the other direction in one frame before returning back to a normal running animation in the next one. While this provides a good chuckle when you're watching the replay, during regular gameplay it looks like a big old frame of chop to the human eye. Enough of these random place taking frames gives the game so much choppiness that you'll really start to wonder how you're supposed to see some of the 1200 animations Acclaim has jammed into the game.   To their credit, Acclaim's designers included a Detail Level adjustment feature in the in-game option screen. Here you can lower the detail level of the entire game and toggle off some of the graphics that may slow down the game like field logos, shadows and referees. The problem is, when you switch it down to the comical lowest detail level, you're looking at a game that looks worse than any football game ever seen on the N64. The worst Playstation game didn't look this bad. Your best bet is to switch off all the extra graphics and opt for the second highest detail mode. The fact that they've even included this option for players means that Acclaim knew this one was coming out with some problems. Why would a company that prides itself on high resolution, detailed graphics give us the option to turn them off if it didn't affect gameplay?  As we said, the hundreds of animations included in this game may be great but they'll look funny since there's no way to run them smoothly. The best ones by far are the celebrations. These came off pretty well and since you can choose which one you do after a touchdown, sack or other big play, the celebrations become an integral part of the game. ~Dunking~ the ball over the goal post or taking a bow is available to all players and it's great to be able to use quarterbacks in some of those flashy displays of excitement. Quarterback Club 2000 is a disappointment for several reasons. QBC '99 showed such promise that I was sure the 2000 version would be a breakthrough year for the franchise with all of the accumulated knowledge and refinement that was sure to go in it. The short production schedule for this one (QBC games usually come out later in the fall) really leaves this one feeling incomplete and rushed. Things like a color coded designation for running and passing plays or better camera angles on quarterback sacks are changes that were suggested earlier in development but never implemented in the final product. What we're left with is basically an incomplete game that could've really brought some nice new ideas to the football sim genre if only they had been executed in a better football game. The Pin-Point passing and pass catching functions should definitely be kept in future versions so don't judge them by this less than worthy product. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that QBC 2000 didn't even improve on the stellar good looks that we last saw with QBC '99 last year. One thing Acclaim has shown they can do well is high resolution graphics. It's almost a staple of theirs. One thing we've yet to see is a smooth high resolution game. I can only hope that this year's QBC is an aberration and that the best is yet to come.", "date": "Sep 1, 1999"}
