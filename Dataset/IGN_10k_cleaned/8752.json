It is the ultimate paring; up there with toast and jam, dogs and tennis balls and Nintendo and fanboys. It's all about the swords, the jumping, the water-running and the crazy ninja magic. And Ninja Gaiden is the granddaddy of the popular ninja game, starting life on the NES back in 1988 and spawning a trilogy starring the blue jumpsuit-clad bad-arse, Ryu Hayabusa - the Solitary Super Ninja.    Enter Ninja Gaiden Sigma, the PS3 re-release of Ninja Gaiden Black, which in itself was an expanded version of Ninja Gaiden - not on NES - but on the original Xbox, developed by Team Ninja. Still with me here? Good, because if you're a gamer looking for hardcore almost-old-school gaming bliss, Sigma is not a game to gloss over and let pass by, like a ninja in the night.   It's hard, fun, frequently thrilling and has lots of ninjas. What else do you need? Incidentally, a lot of patience because, as history might suggest, Sigma is hard as nails and will punish careless players, smacking them around like a piddling puppy.    As the scene is set for this epic quest, Ryu is returning to his village, which has been set ablaze by the fiery and merciless Lord of the Greater Fiends, Doku, who serves the emperor of the Vigoor empire. The angry, soulless fellow has also swiped the Dark Dragon Blade and Ryu is out for revenge. Out to thwart Ryu, however, are legions of ninjas and spirits, military agents and numerous bosses bent on extracting as much of your blood as possible.   Being a kick-ass ninja, Ryu has a ton of fancy-pants abilities at his disposal. Two primary attack buttons - square and triangle, coupled with jump and a projectile-based make for interesting combos.    Do it, Ryu! He's the badass ninja who doesn't take no guff from nobody, foo'.  Ryu's movements are impressively fast and precise; he's been animated very delicately and his combo-based attacks flow together like a dark dance. Equipping him with nunchaku or the new dual-katanas 'Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang' results in an incredible twirling display of death that never pops from one animation into another, in the typical fighting-game jarring effect. More than once, we drifted back into 'Monkey' daydreams while dealing punishment with the bright red staff. No Pigsy or flying cloud transport to be found here, though.   New techniques are eventually unlocked through mastery of each weapon, and when combined with ninja magic techniques (referred to as Ninpo), Ryu is a formidable character. We had some issues with accidentally casting Ninpo when in furious button-mashing battles - particularly since casting Ninpo requires you to set it to your projectile attack button, which you'll be pressing with shocking frequency.   Almost all of this, of course, is identical to what we saw in Ninja Gaiden on Xbox. So what's new and different? Team Ninja has done the honourable thing and added a fair amount of new content while also tweaking some of the game's balance in areas like enemy AI, your abilities and some of the weapons available early in the game. This time around, you can also flick shurikens while jumping, as well as scamper across the surface of bodies of water. None of these tweaks are game-dynamic altering by any means but, like the game itself, together these changes are more than the sum of their parts - the experience is more enjoyable for the adjustments made.    Most striking initially are the new in-game cut scenes - mainly because they look so cool; so cool, in fact, that they stick out like a sore thumb next to the original sequences taken from the Xbox game. In fact, it kind of makes us wish Team Ninja had gone one step further and redone all the cut scenes in-engine to keep the visual continuity throughout.   Overall, the PS3 churns out a very good looking engine. We say 'overall' since, when broken down into components, Ninja Gaiden Sigma doesn't stack up nearly as well against other current releases. The textures can be bland and undefined, the character models are pretty good, but suffer from Team Ninja's 'wax figure' curse. That said, we'd be damned fools to deny that the game is anything less than very fetching. The framerate is liquid-smooth, the lighting (and in particular, the flame effects) are excellent, and we really appreciate the lip-synching for the English-dub of the game's dialogue. The PS3 is capable of much more, but there is plenty of artistry on display.   Many character models have also been redesigned slightly, with improved textures and a higher polygon count. We did note a little bit of screen-tearing during moments when the screen was scrolling quickly, such as when we fell from a great height or went sliding down a hillside.   Rachael, a hunter of Vigoor Fiends, is a new playable character introduced in later levels. Her inclusion is almost compelling enough to warrant a revisit to the game for fans who've played Ninja Gaiden. She's not nearly as nimble as Ryu - she wields an enormous War Hammer and whip - the only weapons she's able to use - and is more prone to taking damage from vastly speedier enemies. As such, you'd better get used to making the most of the block button, because otherwise you'll end up swamped. Rachael also gets her own missions in Mission mode, which is a nice touch.    Blood, big swords and lovely animation. Ah Ninja Gaiden - we love you.  A few things have also gone missing in the jump to PS3. You can no longer unlock the original arcade Ninja Gaiden, although you could in Gaiden Black. Ponderously, the Movie Theatre is missing, likewise with the introductory movie concerning the history of the Dragon Sword and the Dark Dragon Blade   We mentioned this game is deviously hard a little earlier in the review - and we're not kidding. It's one of Sigma's greatest assets and biggest foes. On one side, the challenge is right in line with old-world platform/action titles. You can't afford to get hit too many times, and enemies are dastardly and numerous. You'll die and you'll die pretty frequently. And what is more, you're actually supposed to - as far as we can tell - because that's what it takes to learn from mistakes and improve your ability. Sigma doesn't pander to you like other hack-and-slashers. It laughs at you.   On the other side, this kind of steep learning curve can be alienating for gamers who just want to waltz through and enjoy the puzzling and occasionally nonsensical story. For gamers like that, your best bet is to die a lot early on in the game because Team Ninja has kindly provided an escape rope. If you so choose, you can opt out of being a true ninja, and you'll enter a noticeably easier version of the game, where enemies deal less pain and you deal more; items are plentiful and the game goes easy on you.   Honestly, Ninja Gaiden Sigma is probably best viewed as a meaty appetiser for the proper next-gen Ninja Gaiden that is almost certainly in development. There are still some camera issues, it's still maddeningly hard, and it won't interest you now if it hasn't already, but we're in love all over again, especially thanks to the chunky dose of new content. And the graphical improvements and gameplay refinements should ensure that old fans are unsheathing their steel all over again alongside newbies dipping their toes into the series. Highly recommended.", "date": "Jul 5, 2007"}
