The development house was responsible for some of the era's greatest hits, like Winter Games, Gateway to Apshai, and Jumpman. And now one of the firm's most iconic games has made it to mobile: Impossible Mission.   But purists looking to ~stay a while, stay forever~ will be surprised after they download the game to their phone. This is not a pixel-port of the classic. While the overall layout and structure of the game remains the same, Mforma has commissioned an update to the visuals. The pasty white hero has been replaced with a muscle man soldier and the colorful maze is now dark. The vending machines you used to search for codes have been replaced with crates and machinery. It's actually something of a letdown. A game like Impossible Mission really only has cachet with old-school gamers, and by yanking the identifying look, Mforma may turn off the game's built-in audience.   The majority of the old-school play remains, though. You must still search out every piece of machinery and junk for codes to an underground base's elevators and robots, as well as the code to stop a madman's evil project. There is a new wrinkle to the game, though: guns. The hero has a pistol he can use to permanently disable the robots in the maze-like headquarters. You have a limited number of bullets at the start of the game, but more can be found by searching objects. If you are out of bullets, or want to conserve them, you can opt to jump over robots instead.I didn't look at screens before I downloaded Impossible Mission to my Sanyo 8200. Sometimes I like to play games sight-unseen so I have zero expectations. Because I'm old enough to remember the classic, this remake was a big disappointment for me. Guns? Beefy hero? The original sold over 3 million units without those things. But if you are a newcomer to the game, you likely won't care about the changes -- all you'll know is you're playing an adventure game. In that sense, I'm envious. But about ten minutes in, I was wishing my C64 wasn't mercilessly sold in a garage sale so I could relive this classic.", "date": "Apr 1, 2005"}
