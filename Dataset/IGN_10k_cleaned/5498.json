The company's 1999 NASCAR Revolution was greeted with sneers and derision by the hardcore racing sim community. It was said that EA lacked the technical know-how and passion to go toe-to-toe with Papyrus and MCI when it came to making gritty, realistic racing simulations. But EA stuck with it, each year releasing a somewhat more improved NASCAR PC title. But even after EA cut a deal with NASCAR for an exclusive license, players stuck with their dated sims and commiserated about the sorry state of affairs in the ~realistic sim racing~ genre.    I personally was not optimistic until I talked to EA and discovered that some of the engineers who had worked for Papyrus were now at EA's Tiburon facility in Florida, along with some of the ISI staff who had made EA's now-discontinued F1 sims. EA assured me that they were absolutely committed to building top-of-the-line realistic NASCAR sims for the PC community. And while EA's Xbox and PS2 NASCAR titles actually took a big step down this year in quality, EA's PC developers went back to the drawing board, spent extra time, and set out to make this the year that Papyrus' past robust NASCAR titles could finally be replaced.  I'm pleased to report that they have done just that.   Gameplay   The most important aspects of any game that dares include the words ~Sim Racing~ in its title are realism and believability of the vehicles' physics engine. This is a combination of driving physics accuracy and the almost indescribable ~feel~ as you begin to lay down laps. One thing that I've always missed in NASCAR sims is what I'll call ~drivable oversteer.~ It's the ability to take your car over the edge and bring it back again. We take this ability for granted in rally sims, but somehow we haven't expected a really good oversteer model in NASCAR. It's always been very simple: If you enter an oval turn too fast, you'll push out toward the wall, tires howling in protest. You have to get out of the throttle to hold the car off the wall. You can even jump aggressively off the throttle and not worry about a sudden spin. That scenario is just not plausible. Papyrus took a few stabs at getting it right, but the resulting NASCAR 4 brought complaints that the cars were undrivable.      This year, however, EA has absolutely nailed it with the handling of these cars. Working the throttle and wheel carefully, you can induce a bit of oversteer and use it to your advantage. You can find ways to save the car, should you enter a turn a little too fast, or just rotate the nose a little faster in mid-corner. It gives you a wonderful sense of oneness with the car, which is, after all, what we look for in a realistic sim.  But don't assume you can drive your way out of any oversteer situation. During one virtual race at Daytona, an AI car moved and tapped the rear left quarter panel of my car, pushing my nose down toward the apron. My car started slipping away from me. I counter-steered frantically, trying to save it, working the throttle gently to regain some grip. It worked a little too well. The car grabbed and snapped around toward the wall, and I fishtailed up into it. Sometimes, especially if I flirted with putting my left side beneath the white line on the less-banked asphalt, I lost the car so fast it couldn't be caught, and up into the wall I flew.   In addition to nailing the physics model, the car setup screens are fully detailed, nearly matching the best F1 sims for the number of adjustments you can make to your car. A Windows-based telemetry system allows you to save your laps and look at detailed graphs comparing the performance of just about every mechanism in the car and how it helps or hurts your time.   Thankfully, for those of us who have not yet earned our PhD's in vehicle dynamics, EA has provided a rookie, qualifying, and race setup for every track in the game. All are drivable and fairly competitive. There are also simple sliders for making coarse adjustments to the setup of the car, and you can bypass the mind-bogglingly complex two pages of garage screens. You can also trade setup files over the Internet and let the gurus do your tweaking for you.   When setting the difficulty level of the AI cars, you can tune, as a percentage, their aggression level and speed. It's fair to point out that all of these features have been in sims for some time. The AI cars aren't bad. They drive believable lines, pass low or high, can tap or squeeze you at any given point, and usually recover their cars even when they get loose. On the whole, they feel authentic while they are racing.   EA implemented all the latest and greatest NASCAR Rules, including the sometimes controversial ~Lucky Dog~ rule that lets the first driver to become a lap down to get his lap back during a caution period (this does away with the dangerous practice of ~racin' back to the line~). It also accounts for double file restarts and assesses penalties for going too slow under caution, lapping the field under yellow, etc. Unfortunately, even if you follow every audible and visual instruction, the game can shaft you when it gets confused about where you are and what you should be doing.   In the course of a single caution, while accurately following the computer's directions, I still managed to go a lap down and earn a stop and go penalty. The in-game instructions in that situation were neither accurate nor timely: I was told to slow down to get behind a certain car. When I slowed down, I got a warning that I was going too slow and almost immediately was told I'd lost my place in the line for going too slow, even though I was just waiting for the other car to catch up to me.   After pitting, I exited the pit lane as the pace car was going by, and slowed to fall back to the end of the line, only to be told that I had lapped the field under yellow and would be assessed a stop and go. Things like this forced me to turn on the ~auto-drive~ feature during cautions. But even that mode didn't work right. I was told that I was the ~Lucky Dog~ and that I should proceed past the pace car to get my lap back. But the AI driving my car refused to budge. And I could not override it! So, I didn't feel like such a ~Lucky Dog~ after all.    I've been assured that bugs of this nature can and will be ironed out, and I expect they will be made available as patches to the game. But it takes away from the believability of the game when you can't trust it to manage the rules properly. Fortunately, you can turn off yellows and tweak other rules to minimize the negative effects of these problems until a fix is available. For multiplayer, it is a serious issue that will probably have many leagues resorting to turning off yellow flags until it is fixed.   For multiplayer racing, EA has finally raised their game to the point where you can theoretically race in a full 43-car grid online. I did some test races with the folks at EA, as well as some members of the NASCAR gaming community, and I have been pleased with the results. There's not too much lag, and all the options Papyrus gave us for setting up and running race servers are here in abundance, including a dedicated race server program if you're running a league or just feel charitable. This is the heart of the game's longevity and explains why EA's previous efforts were greeted less warmly. NASCAR Online leagues need to support large fields and provide a realistic Internet racing experience. As any online racer can tell you, going door-to-door at 180 MPH is no place for cars that regularly warp in any given direction!   Finally, there is now a career mode. The game supports the NASCAR Trucks Series, the Busch Series and the Nextel Cup Series. In career mode, you start out with some money and a truck. As you drive races in the season, sponsors express interest in you, and you can sign them up and get their livery on your car. You can also invest in R&D to improve car designs, repair existing cars, and build and paint new ones. To add some spice to this, your popularity is tracked with merchandise sales. You can manufacture merchandise such as shirts, figurines, and die-cast cars, and make a profit (or loss) from their sales.   As you might expect, your on-track performance affects the demand for merchandise. It's a decent, if not spectacular, career system. The biggest complaint I have is the unevenness of the AI at each track. I started a career with AI difficulty set at 93%, so I wouldn't have to adjust the setups to remain competitive. I won Atlanta running away, finished in last place two laps down at Martinsville, finished four laps ahead of the field at the fictional ~Dodge Raceway,~ and then ran away with it at Lowe's Raceway in Charlotte. Feast or famine, you might say, and  not as tightly competitive as I had hoped.     Almost everything in this game, including AI configurations, can be tuned and modded by the gaming community. Out of the box, it can be very difficult to find the ~right~ difficulty level for you. For some time, I have asked companies like EA for automatic difficulty level settings, based on practice times at each track, but this still hasn't happened. You must resort to trial and error and fiddle with settings on a track-by-track basis until you get what you want. Rather tedious, in my opinion.    Further, it's worth noting that, in career mode, your initial car has mediocre ratings for grip, power, acceleration, torque, etc, and you must use R&D to design and build new cars to improve your stats.  It is therefore very difficult to decide what you should be able to accomplish with any given car. A first-year driver in a mediocre team would not expect to win the championship his first time out, but to be consistent, score some points and earn his way through the ranks. The career mode in the game doesn't really give you any sense of what you should target in the way of goals. You just do your best and hope it is good enough.   Graphics   The graphics in this game are shockingly good. I say this not only because they looked great on EA's computers, but because they look great on my now below-average 1.8GHz Pentium with a GeForce 4400. After running the 3DSetup program EA provides to configure your suggested graphics levels, I was at 1024x768x16 with most settings at medium. This gave me a comfortably smooth frame rate in most every circumstance, and looked pretty darned good. But for laughs, I went ahead and maxed everything out and bumped the resolution to 1280x1024x32. Amazingly, the game was still eminently drivable. Unless I was at the tail end of a 30+ car train, the graphics were always over 20 FPS. Take away half of those cars and I stood at 30, and in most practice conditions I was easily over that mark (Ctrl-F is the undocumented, but easily guessed, way to see your current FPS).   EA has bragged about using pixel shaders and all the other latest and greatest graphical buzzwords in this game, and it shows. As you'll see from looking at the screenshots included, the game is incredibly detailed. Even the inside of the cars are decadently detailed. You'll see things you've never seen before, such as white stickers on new tires of the car ahead of you, and highly detailed stands full of animated fans. As your car bottoms out on the pavement, you'll see a stream of sparks flying up and behind you. Smoke from spinouts or accidents floats over the track and lingers for several minutes.    I don't think I've ever seen the NASCAR tracks so lovingly made and so pretty to look at. Most of the time in EA's NASCAR games, I would skip the National Anthem and Jet flyover cut scenes. With this game, I find myself watching them, just to admire the track detail.  The asphalt on the road is beautifully textured, well beyond what was absolutely necessary, and lighting and shadow affects are everywhere. The bottom line is that this is a drop-dead gorgeous rendition of NASCAR.   During gameplay, the car's interior will bounce around you as you hit bumps in the pavement, and the rear view mirror will vibrate. Decent-looking gloved hands will turn the wheel--not the crudely rendered polygon-arms that we've seen in the past. And in a marked improvement over Papyrus' sims, the various function-key pop-up panels (F2=Standings, F3=Lap Times, F4=Tire status, etc.) are stackable, all the way up the right side of the screen. You can tap the keys in whichever order you like to stack exactly the information you want. No more having to fumble with function keys to jump from screen to screen.   Sound   The sounds are convincingly real and spatially oriented. You'll hear that car bearing down on you from behind before you think to check out your mirror. The spotter chatters constantly, telling you which car is to your left (low) or right (high), and when you're clear. Your crew chief will let you know if your oil and water temperatures are getting too hot--for example, if you've put too much grille tape on the front, he'll recommend you pit and get some removed to get more air into the engine.   Tire squeal, an important part of driving feedback, is not an annoying nails-on-chalkboard squeal, but a low-frequency ~rubbing~ sound. It can be a little too difficult to hear, which is my only complaint. I've had to turn down the volume on engine noises in order to hear that most important audio cue of car control.   EA Trax are standard fare in EA Sports games, so expect to get some headbanging hard rock or metal (I can never tell which) while you look at menu screens. Thankfully, EA left it out of driving mode, where it would be nothing but a nuisance.   Extras   Full race replays help round out the package. You can automatically save your entire race replay to your hard drive, and examine it later in EA's Replay Studio. You can view any camera angle from any car's perspective, save bookmarks, save clips from it, etc. Basically everything Papyrus gave us is here now--finally! You can also press ~R~ at any time while driving to see a quick instant replay of the last several seconds.     I would like to have seen a bigger, more Papyrus-like manual, with guides for each track and more detailed car setup information. It was always nice to get an education on the sport as well as just getting to drive. But EA only gives you a 10-page manual. To their credit, the manual includes a comprehensive key map and a several page setup ~fix it~ guide with suggestions for setting changes based upon what the car is doing. I understand that it's expensive to print big manuals, but I did optimistically hope for a nice fat .PDF inside the game for some relaxing after-race reading. Alas, it was not to be. However, EA did enlist the help of NASCAR driver Ryan Newman to both playtest the game throughout its development and provide feedback on how best to set up the car. This is all incorporated into a Garage 101 document on the EA Sports' NASCAR website. I hope that we will see some telemetry tutorials there soon, as well.  It's been six years in coming, but EA has finally delivered the goods. They rewrote their physics engine, spent extra long months tweaking and tuning and testing after the console versions shipped. The extra time has paid off handsomely. EA's NASCAR SimRacing has earned its name, and in doing so, it has finally compelled me to free up the space on my hard drive that Papryus had occupied through years of EA's previous attempts to close the gap. EA has not only closed that gap, but they have exceeded Papyrus' efforts in many significant ways, such as the excellent physics model, featuring ~drivable oversteer,~ third-party extensibility, and just about every option imaginable.EA should be applauded for not throwing PC versions of the console titles at us, for understanding who the target PC racing simulation customer is, and going the extra mile to make us happy. It's not a perfect game. The glitches in the management of the NASCAR rules will have to get patched up. But there are things you can patch and things you cannot. You cannot patch a fundamentally flawed physics model to suddenly become a gem, but you can patch up a few rules fixes. I expect them to do the latter. This is no arcade game, even with the numerous optional driving aids. But neither is it unapproachable for someone who wants to get a taste of realistic NASCAR Racing. The hardcore virtual racers who like any highly realistic sim should consider this a mandatory purchase, and anyone else interested in NASCAR should definitely take a hard look.", "date": "Feb 17, 2005"}
