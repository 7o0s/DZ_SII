It's a wonder that Sega chose such a bizarre naming and licensing structure for this series.  ~Super Wonder Boy~, ~Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair~, and ~Wonder Boy V Monster World III~, to name a fewseriously?  Regardless of the sub-series naming extravaganza, the game we're dealing with here is the last one mentioned.  Known internationally as Wonder Boy in Monster World, it is the last game in the series to have an official English release, which occurred in October of 1991.  The game features a distinctive blend of platforming and RPG elements that create a fun and unique experience.   Vicious beasts have invaded Monster World and settled in quite comfortably.  It's up to the hero, Shion, to save the day and prevent the treacherous BioMeka from achieving its demonic aims.  What sets this title apart from standard platformers is the intuitively integrated RPG elements.  Players can improve their armor, boots, and weapons throughout the quest, with eight available upgrades for each.  There are six types of magic, including Fire Storm, Thunder, and Quake.  Health-replenishing items are available for purchase, and the life meter can be extended by finding heart containers.  By visiting the local Inn, the player can save the game and restore health.            It is imperative to converse with the townspeople in various locales in order to obtain crucial items and information. While some items and weaponry are awarded to the player upon completing various tasks, most upgrades are purchased at weapon and item shops.  Currency is abundant, as gold coins fly from fallen foes.  Enemies respawn several times in most areas, making it more difficult to traverse, but the player is awarded by a bounty of money.  At times it can be slightly irritating as there can be some frivolous backtracking, and facing the same enemies again and again may grow tiresome.  Using the Classic Controller, tap 1 to swipe with the weapon (repeatedly to twirl a sword), 2 to jump, and A for magic. In order to aid players in battling the plentiful enemies, there is a bar at the top of the screen which displays the health of the enemy being attacked.  The caveat, however, is the amount of the screen in which the HUD takes up.   One third of the TV is comprised of the Heads Up Display, showing the player and enemy health, gold pieces, and the magic or item currently equipped.  While some of these gauges are necessary, the amount of the screen that is forfeited for this purpose seems excessive.  However, despite the aforementioned shortcomings, this is a highly addictive and charming game.   The graphics are beautiful, with lush, scrolling backgrounds, a bright color palette, and a good amount of detail.  The sprite animations are quite good, and the end result gives the game a unique feel, submerging players in this fantastical land.  Complementing the delightful visuals is an even more impressive soundtrack.  It has an orchestral feel to it, and each area in the game has its own music track - in fact, in the first 30 minutes alone, you'll probably hear 7-10 different themes.  The music really sets the mood for the adventure, which is most enjoyable.    Fans of the series likely need no convincing, as they've doubtless already downloaded this delightful title.  Similar to Super Paper Mario (without the 3D), but stressing more of the upgrading element, Wonder Boy in Monster World is a solid addition to the VC library.  The stellar soundtrack, beautiful graphics, engaging story, and rewarding gameplay will keep gamers glued to this lengthy quest for quite some time.  A marvelous matrimony between action and RPG, spending 800 Wii points on this game will be a decision you shan't regret.", "date": "Apr 26, 2007"}
