But when I stood in line at 3:00 am at the theater waiting for the premiere of ~The Phantom Menace~ (and yes, I didn't think too highly of it), the number of people dressed as Star War characters was kind of startling.  I mean, when you see a guy dress up as Princess Leia that's some fanaticism.  Then come the Star Wars games and there have been some good ones, especially the Super series on the SNES.  But lately, we've seen some real mediocre ~license reliant~ titles like Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and Jedi Power Battles.  Both titles aren't regarded highly in my book but crazy Star Wars fans still eat them up, calling me all sorts of colorful names.  And so, this flame mail battle between blind Star Wars fans and myself has been going on for sometime, with no end in sight... but perhaps Star Wars Demolition will change that.  While not exactly a great game, Star Wars Demolition has just enough gameplay for me to enjoy -- and for Star Wars zealots to go crazy for.  The premise behind Star Wars Demolition is pretty simple - take the blazing Dreamcast Vigilante 8 engine and mix it with Star Wars characters and vehicles.  Obviously, each vehicle has different abilities in speed, firepower, and durability, as well as having different special attack techniques.  If you really need a story here it is: Jabba the Hut has organized a new sport where pilots blast each other till the fat slug-like gangster bellows.  You'll travel across the galaxy and clash in several different settings that include the ice dunes of Hoth, the dirty alleys of Mos Eisley, and even on the surface of the Death Star II itself.  Visually, the game is a mixed bag. The good is the framerate and it blisters at a smooth 60fps.  Although it drops a few notches when the action gets really scary, the framerate always returns to the original 60 fps during most of the game. Character models are well-detailed and animate (for those that do animate) well.  A good example is the Rancor (equipped with shoulder-mounted cannons... yeah, very frightening) and it's a great delight watching it pick up enemies, twirl them around in the air, and shotput them for some big-time damage.  Explosions and special effects are decent, though when several enemies are around, explosions can fill up the screen up with a blurry mess of colors.  And that's not very nice on the eyes.  Another glaring problem is the V8-style draw-in that constantly occurs.  Basically, the backgrounds, whether they depict cities or mountains, are being constantly drawn in. I suppose that's how they can achieve the great framerate, but it can be very distracting.  Gameplay isn't exactly solid either.  All vehicles control a bit too floaty for my taste and some, like Boba Fett, turn incredibly fast.  I like the weapon mechanics of this game; although you're limited to four types of weapon power-ups, you can charge the weapon to four different levels.  The different charging levels change the weapons delivery, speed, and power, all depending on what level you charge it to.  Protecting yourself is a combination of your shield strength and the armor of your vehicle.  While you can replenish your shield and weapon energy from different charging stations, armor cannot be repaired.  As stated above, the controls are a bit too floaty and this can cause serious problems since the game doesn't feature the greatest collision protection.  It's quite easy to get stuck in certain areas and if you do, you'll need the help of an opponent to blast you out.  And a word of advice to those who decide to buy the game: set the difficulty higher and turn auto-targeting off.  The AI in the game is flawed, as I've seen opponents turn in circles until I hit them with a proton shot.  Likewise, auto-targeting isn't very good; you'll lock onto an opponent from far away but when a new target approaches your vehicle, there's a 3 to 4 second delay before the auto-targeting locks on to the nearby foe.  I don't even know why the game is set default to auto-target, because manual targeting makes the gameplay slightly better.  And manual targeting is really the only way to enjoy the multiplayer battles when playing with four human players.  Despite all my gripes about the visual and gameplay flaws, I actually enjoyed playing the game... in small amounts of time.  Although Star Wars Demolition is far from a great game, it's nice to see a Star Wars game that doesn't rely on the license too much.  Too bad Jar Jar isn't in the game, cuz I would've upped the score if I could fry his floppy ears off.  --Anthony ~Jar Jar Hater~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 22, 2000"}
