{"name": "Sanitarium", "name_review": "Sanitarium", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/13/sanitarium", "text": "Sanitarium is one of the better adventure games released in recent years. The game's storyline is entertaining start to finish, beginning with a classic 'man with amnesia wakes up in an asylum' opening, and getting more and more strange as the game wears on. Across the game's nine acts (spread across three CD-ROMs), you'll slowly learn more about the circumstances of your amnesia and the strange world of madness into which you have descended, with bits of the plot being unveiled in dialogue and fragmentary flashbacks that are spaced out fairly well.  The graphics, both on the screen and in the cut scenes, are of high quality, with a lot of care taken in illustrating the strange and bizarre worlds included in Sanitarium.   Sadly though, the puzzles are pretty standard fare for adventure games--get the dingle from Mr. Smith, take it to Mrs. Jones, get the next thingamajig, put it in the butter churn. These rather perfunctory inventory puzzles alternate with the Myst-y type knob turners and combination locks, most of which are also fairly predictable. But the most frustrating puzzle has to be the maze towards the end of the game, where your character has to negotiate past a number of barriers and instant death things. Fortunately, the game does allow you to save at any point, and dying doesn't end the game but simply restarts you at the beginning of the maze. This helps alleviate much of the tedium of retracing your steps over and over again.  Which is a good thing, since the interface has one rather serious flaw. In order to move your character around your screen, you right click in the desired direction. But because of sticky mouse controls, this means the character often moves off in the wrong direction. This is especially disastrous on the stairwells, because the character will immediately go into a stair-climbing animation, and can't be interrupted until this is done.  These flaws aside though, Sanitarium is still a pretty good adventure game, saved by its good story and some genuinely creepy, atmospheric elements. For adventure gamers looking for a well-told horror story with all the trappings of the typical graphic adventure, Sanitarium will fit the bill. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 13, 1998"}
