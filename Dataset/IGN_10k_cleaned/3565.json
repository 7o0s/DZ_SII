Luckily for sports gamers, EA Sports has had enough with the much maligned Triple Play series, and instead of simply scratching, spitting, and cashing checks (Triple Play sold despite horrid reviews), EA Sports (much like the fanatics from Philly) dumped the entire franchise in hopes of building a contender with innovations and gameplay the likes baseball fans have never seen before.   If you build it they will come. Well, EA built it, and the fans are already lining up around the stadium for a peak inside. But is it really worth the price of admission? The answer is both yes and no.  The thing about MVP Baseball is, the game's as shallow as it is slick, and for every highlight, there seems to be a lowlight to match. Sure EA Sports struts to the plate with an innovative and often electric style of gameplay, but it isn't always about what's in the game that determines whether or not a title's worth purchasing. Sometimes it's about what's been left out, and in the case of MVP Baseball, what's been left out simply can't be ignoredthen again, either can the game's innovations. MVP's new nickname should be ~The Diamond Dichotomy,~ as the game proves to play as a polygonal contradiction, a game so good and at the same time so frustrating, that you'll find yourself loving it for what it is, but hating it for what it could've been.  Gameplay  The first thing you notice when you turn on the game, is that MVP's gameplay is unlike that of any other baseball title currently on the market. In the old days of Triple Play (as well as MVP's competitors), pitching the ball isn't as much about skill as it is picking a pitch and spotting it perfectly on the corner of the plate. In MVP, however, the innovative pitcher/batter interface proves to be EA's ace feature, and the element that makes the game the best head-to-head baseball title to hit the market this season. In order to simply pitch the ball, you have to master a meter that resembles something more from Tiger Woods than Andy Van Hekken (Tiger, Tiger, get it?). Here's an example of how it works: You select the pitch by pressing the button that corresponds to it, then you hold down that button and watch the meter swing to the right (if pitcher is right handed) to determine the pitch's power. Release the button when you reach the desired velocity, then press the same button a second time as it swings back to the left to determine the pitch's accuracy. If you are able to stop the meter within the green accuracy box, you're pitch will be aimed approximately where you aim it in the strike zone. If not, you're liable to throw it anywhere from down the heart of the plate to straight at the hitter's head. In addition, the higher the speed you're attempting to reach with your pitch, the smaller the accuracy box becomes, so while it's easy to toss the slow curve, try spotting a 95mph splitter across the outside corner and see what kind of skill you really have. Finally, a game where it takes timing and touch to not only hit, but to pitch as well. A welcomed addition to video games, and something not seen since 1997's Grand Slam Baseball, the first, and only other game to my recollection, to attempt such an ambitious feat.   In addition to the pitching meter, the hitting zone, and batting in general is also championship caliber. First off, each player's hot and cold zones are displayed directly in the strike zone. This helps not only the hitter know what areas to swing and what spots are best to stay away from, but also helps the pitcher place pitches directly in opposing player's weakest spots. Second, as a batter, you can attempt to hit grounders, long flys, pull the ball, or stroke one to the opposite field depending on what direction you hold while swinging the bat. If you press up, you're more likely to hit a fly ball. Press down and you'll slap it straight into the turf. These swings come into play at different strategic points in the game as you might need to hit a grounder to the right side to move a runner from second to third, or if you're hoping to hit a sacrifice fly to score a run in the late innings.   Another innovation brought to the field in MVP is Picture-in Picture base running. Instead of seeing little dots move around the base paths, now you actually see your players running from base-to-base in small boxes in the top right portion of the screen. This helps you see how close they are to the base, as well as helps you know the instant they start to run, stop, or turn back toward the previous base. All essential while stealing bases, going first-to-home on a double, and while you're caught in a rundown. Base running in general is smooth and easy to understand, adding to the overall experience of the game rather than detracting from the realism and excitement as it did in previous seasons of Triple Play.  And while the majority of gameplay is fun and action-oriented, some problems arise the more you play the game. There are a surprisingly low number of home runs hit in the game, not only against the computer, but in multiplayer as well. This becomes more and more obvious as you play a season with the Giants and Bonds has about 15 roundtrippers by the break, and no one else on your team even comes close. Another problem is the fact that it's nearly impossible to actually strike the computer out. Computer batters never ever never swing at balls out of the strikezone and this can be extremely frustrating when your payoff pitch gets called for ball four when no batter alive could've held his swing. Things like that can turn the average gamer into a ranting Lou Pinella in no time.   Speaking of frustration, MVP lacks a lot of features found in many (if not most) of its competition. There's no Fantasy Draft, no Hall of Fame or Negro League players, no practice mode, no Player of the Game award, no throwback jersey's or old-school stadiums. What MVP does have, though, is top-notch online play through EA Sports Online, where gameplay is smooth and users are rated for their skills at the plate.        In terms of other cool features that made the cut,MVP sports a fantastic Franchise mode where team owners are given a series of goals and objectives you need to accomplish within ten years of your management. And the great thing is, the goals are different for each team. If you're the Yankees, one of your goals is to win four World Series, if you're the Twins, your goal is to win two ALCS', but if you're the Brewers, your goal is to simply finish three seasons over .500. As you progress from season-to-season you have the ability to sign free agents, participate in a rookie draft, and watch as ageless wonders like Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux finally start showing their age and retire from the game they once dominated. You'll be forced to work within your team's budget, making tough decisions on whether or not you should re-sign a loyal player like Craig Biggio or go out and use that money on an a younger player with more promise. And depending on the decisions you make and how they actually work for your team, you're given a manager rating from A to F. Finish with an F, though, and you will be fired and the game will come to an immediate end. Finish with an A+, and you will not only be the toast of the town, you will be offered jobs from other teams in the majors. To help you along the way, you can stop a game in progress at any time during a simulated game and take over for the computer. So if you see you're down by one run in the ninth, you don't have to cross your fingers and hope the computer contributes a clutch performance. You can step up to the plate yourself and take your best hacks at winning the game. To top it off, there is a momentum meter making certain games, games against rivals, home games, and games late in the season, worth more in terms of gaining momentum for your next series of games. Build up some momentum and watch as you start to get all the breaks, from opponents making errors, to your worst fielders making miraculous diving grabs.   Another awesome feature is MVP's Home Run Showdown. Unlike other home run hitting competitions, MVP's isn't based on the number of dingers, but their distance. You're given a goal of say one mile, then you take your cuts to see who can reach the mile first. For every home run you're given an additional 100 feet. For every foul ball or strike, 100 feet is deducted from your total. It's a fun way to not only challenge your friends to a mini game, but to practice the timing of hitting in general.  Graphics  When it comes to visual appeal, EA delivers a diamond dandy. It's by far the best-looking PC baseball game this year and the player faces simply look incredible. From pitchers snarling as they hurl high heat toward your helmet, to batters fidgeting in the box, fingers flexing in order to get a better grip on the bat, if you've seen it happen in a real game, you're going to see it in MVP Baseball. Every polygonal batter's stance and throwing motion is identical to their real-life counterpart. What seems to be missing, however, are animation variations when it comes to turning the double play or getting hit by a pitch. There are also no player collisions, as fielders and base runners simply run through each other's bodiesnot the most realistic highlight for a game that's supposed to simulate the real game, and more importantly, real life. Keeping with the ~Not Keeping it Real~ theme, there are countless times when a player will dive for a ball and the ball appears to hit their chest, back, leg, head, whatever, only for the ball to miraculously show up in the fielder's glove. The good news for the defense is at least they made the catch. The bad news for EA is that when you watch the replay, it makes you laugh rather than cheer.  Sound  The Giants' announce team of Mike Krukow and Duane Kuiper grab the mic to deliver dynamic play-by-play of the action, calling every strike, single, and smash out of the yard with enthusiasm and wit. Quips like ~Ray Durham plays every game like he's going to the electric chair,~ are priceless, and are part of the reason the duo have become fan favorites around the Bay.   Besides the commentary, the audio captures every drop of stadium atmosphere with crowds chanting, clapping, and stomping for their hometown team, horns blaring in the background (Charge!), and you can even hear the hot dog vendors hawkin' goodies to the hungry fans. The guitar rock soundtrack must be muted, however, as someone at EA forgot this is MVP Baseball 2003, not 1993. Like any rookie phenom, no matter how good they play, they're still prone to making rookie mistakes. The great thing about MVP is, even with those mistakes, it's still one of the best baseball titles to hit the market and manages to finish a strong second to High Heat. MVP's pitcher/batter interface alone makes for thrilling head-to-head play as wannabe hurlers finally need skill to throw strikes, while the Franchise mode will have you simulating games for nights-on-end as you try to find the right combination of players and salaries to bring a title to your hometown.The game might not feature the depth of its competitors, and like I said, MVP's not without its faults, but in terms of pickup-and-play ease and excitement and two-player competition (especially online), it still proves to be one of your Most Valuable Purchases this season. Yogi Berra once said, ~If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be.~ Let's just hope MVP's world is a little more perfect next time around.", "date": "Apr 3, 2003"}
