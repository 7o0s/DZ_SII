The marketing purpose was to go up against Pokmon, but it had its own charm and gameplay, and certainly deserved the high score and Editor's Choice award we gave it. Marvin Strikes Back isn't much more than a revisit to the same exact game engine that was used in Alert!. Character animations, background graphics, music  everything used in Marvin Strikes Back has been recycled from the first game in the series. While doing something like this would be considered disappointing (Acclaim did this with All Star Baseball 2000 and Mary-Kate & Ashley for a quick buck), the game has been changed enough to warrant its existence. FeaturesMore than 45 Looney Tunes to play as and collectLink Cable support for two playersInfrared port support for two playersCompatible with Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!Battery Back-upOnly for Game Boy ColorTo get the full feel of the overall game design, I highly recommend reading the original review of Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! for a full explanation.Marvin Strikes Back takes place after Alert! -- Marvin's back on Mars, sulking after his defeat. He intercepts a broadcast: Daffy Duck's new movie, in which the duck claims he was the one responsible for thwarting the Martian's plan. This pisses Marvin off to no end, and sets off on his own task  fly back to earth and cook Daffy's goose once and for all.The gameplay is identical to Alert, which means that you'll have to rely on other characters you encounter to help you get through the lengthy adventure. Marvin is extremely limited in his capabilities, only able to walk and shoot. In order to advance through parts of the game, you'll have to utilize the skills of other characters  for example, K-9 can leap crevices, but can't attack anyone...Speedy Gonzalez can fit into small areas and run really fast. The game's pretty linear, so most of the necessary characters will be in the same spot every time you play  but there are several non-playable characters to acquire and trade...most of which show up randomly to encourage the whole ~trading~ thing with other characters.What's more, Marvin Strikes Back is fully compatible with Alert, so you can compete for collected Looney Tunes characters in both versions of the game through the three head-to-head minigames. These games are probably the weakest link in an overall great package  but it's better they're in there than not.Just as the game plays identically to Alert!, it also looks identical. All the art assets used in the original game are used again here  only the arrangement of the game's levels has been changed. There have been new additions to the engine  a brand new introduction and cutscenes within the storyline, for example. If you're looking for something completely new, this isn't going to ease your fix -- but there's a lot to like here, even if you've seen, heard, and played it before.I really loved the original Alert!, and the same love is here for Marvin Strikes Back. Sure, it's a little disturbing to see the same elements recycled from the original game, but the design of the sequel has been changed enough to warrant an additional purchase  after all, you're playing as the bad guy this time around! Plus, a couple characters that weren't playable the first time around make a return as controllable ones  a nice addition that'll thrill Looney Tunes fans. I don't think this game's as clean as the original, though  I've stumbled onto a few bugs (the programming kind, not the bunny) that'll get your character stuck in the walls, forcing you to commit suicide in order to get free. That, and I'm still not a fan of the Save Game feature  you really need to save the game at any point, but that option isn't offered here. Still, a great adventure game gets a great sequel, even if it's more of the same.", "date": "Feb 14, 2001"}
