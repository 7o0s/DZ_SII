From its rise to fame and popularity with fighting game original Fatal Fury to its less than stellar performance via Art of Fighting, the company's friendly competition with Capcom Entertainment helped fuel a generation of games that took the fighting genre to another level. Samurai Spirits, Breakers, and The King of Fighters propelled the digital software makers to heights they never could have imagined, while a late-90s financial bust of unforeseen proportions forced the company to be bought out and practically dissolved overnight. A turbulent journey to be sure, the fighting game legend has still managed to find a way to survive.   And survive they have. As this past Thanksgiving in Japan the latest owner of the SNK Intellectual properties known as Playmore decided to unveil its first product based on the SNK license -- The King of Fighters 2000. Ported over from the archaic Neo-Geo system and bundled with a few extras that the Dreamcast incarnation didn't have, KOF 2000 has arrived just in time for the holidays. And while the game is based on a product that's now pushing the three-year-old mark, hardcore fighting fans looking for a simple jaunt to the old school needn't look any farther to get their chops in. Even if the game is beginning to show the wear and tear of nearly a decade of modifications.   Features  King of Fighters games have always been known for their deep roster of characters and detailed attention to fan concerns, and KOF 2000 is no different. Building on the popularity of the striker system of the previous year, there's a whole slew of players from other KOF and SNK games hidden within its bowels. Chris, Rugal, Baijang, Duck King, and a boatload of other characters have made the cut, along with a few extras thrown in specifically for the PS2 version (Krauser, Mr. Big, and more!).   There are also five brand new selectable characters to add to the storyline (Lin, Ramon, Hinako, Kula, and Zero), and each one of them brings a little something different to the table; Lin is probably the coolest of all of them and is an appropriately dark ninja type warrior who's nothing short of dynamite to play. As an added bonus, Kula is available on the character select screen from the moment you boot up the disc (a feature not available in previous home versions), and a PS2 specific option known as Party has been included as well. A slightly different version of survival where you gain energy back for hits landed, Party is the section you'll want to spend a lot of your time. As this is the area where you can gain the Ps2 specific characters I mentioned earlier.    Of course there are a few other game modes to satiate your fighting thirst too. Team and Single play, a pretty decent practice option, and an opening cinematic feature called Memory Mode that allows you to watch the intro movies from past King of Fighters titles. The choices are above the usually skinny order of goodies presented in KOF, and I was glad that the developers decided to throw in a little something extra for the fans. The one aspect I wasn't so happy about however, was the lack of Team Orochi. They're in there are Strikers sure, but I wanted to use them full on (and will get my chance in KOF 2002).   Gameplay  What's to be said about the King of Fighters engine that hasn't been said before? Similar to Street Fighter in various respects, the 90s-era mechanics are definitely showing signs of advanced geriatrics. Given four attack buttons, a striker button, and a taunt key, KOF 2000 plays almost identically to every prequel before it. Unlike Street Fighter Alpha or to a lesser extent the older Mortal Kombats however, King of Fighters has lost its reliance on projectile attacks, and the emphasis on a close range battle is obvious. It's just as well really, considering the fact that projectiles in the older KOF games did little more than set up jumping fireball traps for cheese masters.    That said, the combo system is pretty straightforward and veterans who have been playing 2D fighters like this for years should have no problem adjusting to the slightly different nuances of 2000. If you're curious, there's a Super Meter just like Street Fighter and the like, along with two specialized fighting techniques known as Armor and Counter Mode. A spruced-up rendition of the power-up, Armor Mode will cause your character to start flashing yellow, give them increased strength, and prevent that character from being countered. Similarly, Counter Mode causes your character to flash red, gives them an added strength boost, and allows them to cancel out of Supers into Desperations moves. It may sound a bit complicated, but it really isn't, and whether or not you use these special techniques is entirely up to you. Novices and intermediate players don't really need to concern themselves with it anyway, but once they've learned the bonuses of a charged Power Gauge, there's no going back.   If I had one problem with the way this system works it would have to be with how the Power Gauge is handled. Rather than keep the manual charge found in the earlier games (accomplished by pressing two buttons of similar power at the same time), the game instead takes a page from Capcom's Alpha series and rises according to damage inflicted and taken. And though it's not a big enough problem to warrant the pitchfork and some torches, I would have preferred to see the gauge handled the old way -- there's a lot more strategy involved.   Speaking of strategy, the Striker system from King of Fighters '99: Evolution has made a return as well. A lot more balanced and refined than the previous game's version, the striker system is SNK's own take on the Assist feature of theMarvel vs. Capcom series. Accessed by pressing R1 at any time, the Striker system sends a second (or fourth depending on whether or not you're playing Team or Single mode) character onto the screen to perform some kind of special technique; be it offensive, defensive, or recovery. Different depending on what character you choose to be your helper (which is then further defined by sub-characters in another menu for even greater variety), the Strikers add a great deal more to the importance of a match here than they did in '99. You can even use them for juggles and multi-hit combos -- a practice not easily found before.    It's just too bad that the game doesn't offer enough of innovation to really get gamers excited. Though the opposing A.I. is as challenging (re: cheap) as ever and the fighting combat engine is sound, it feels as though we've played this a million times before. Which makes perfect sense: because we have. Why didn't SNK look into building an all-new engine for King of Fighters 2000 when they still had the chance? Or if they were adamant about to sticking to their guns for this obviously aged grappler, why not throw some advancements and originality in there? Why give us what turns out to be practically the same old thing?   Graphics  Quite possibly the most difficult category to analyze in the entire game, KOF 2000's visuals are a victim of their own age. Already dated considerably by two and a half years (on an eight year old fighting engine at that), the animations of the fighters and backgrounds appear to be far below today's standards. The arenas in particular are the most obvious victims of father time, with only two or three spacious idle movements per object. Curiously, the backgrounds are once again sprite-based flat maps, wherein KOF '99 offered up polygon-based stages. Strange that SNK chose to move backwards instead of forward in this regard. Then again, the over all speed of the fighters this time around is much faster than previously, and the lack of polygons being pushed behind the scenes could have something to do with that.    Unfortunately, the fighters themselves are somewhat choppy and for reasons unknown are still noticeably slower than the Neo-Geo MVS version. Comparable perhaps to the same jerky presentation of the old arcade monster Super Street Fighter II: Turbo, the final graphical images may not be enough to satiate the spoiled populace of today's slick, cartoon-like heavyweights like Guilty Gear X and Street Fighter III: Third Strike.   One thing King of Fighters 2000 does have going for it in this category however is the excellent character design. From the updated look of old staples like King and Andy Bogard, to the futuristic Goth looks of Lin and Kula, KOF 2000 sports one of the best looking casts in years. Of particular note is Athena, who's short Chinese-style dress and adorable little bandana presents her with her best costume in memory. That could be said about nearly all the characters in fact, except perhaps the Korean team who haven't changed appearances since they first made a splash in the original King of Fighters nine billion years ago. Oh and one other thing, King of Fighters games have the best win poses in the industry: bar none.   Sound  KOF 2000 will sound pretty familiar  to veterans of the series as far as vocal samples go, since they're the same ones we heard in Dream Match and Evolution. Chou Reppa Dan, Ryuuko Ranbu, and Psycho Sword are but a few of the many returning yells and screams that each and every character wields after each maneuver, and I'd be lying if I didn't recognize how perfect each voice actor was in their respective roles.   Musically I've heard better from the series (most notably in 1997), but the remixed classics in 2000 are more than acceptable. Luckily there are a few tunes that truly stand out (Kyo and Benimaru's to be specific), and the option to switch back and forth between the original arcade sound and an arranged version is a nice touch that few videogames do nowadays (as opposed to SNK who have been offering this feature in its games for eons).   It's just too bad that the only available sound modes were Monaural and Stereo. Straight port that the game may be, it still would have been nice to see the programmers take an extra step and add some basic surround support in there. Ah well, perhaps we'll see it in the 2001 disc.I hate to say it, but King of Fighters 2000 is the game that finally had me doubting the future of the series. Don't misunderstand me; it's not a terrible title in the least (in fact, it's quite entertaining when you're playing with a group of people that know what they're doing), it's just that we've been battling this way for so damn long, I fear it's starting to become stale. And what's really terrifying is that this was a game built nearly three years ago -- there have been two more since then. How will those two stand up when they make it to the PlayStation 2?That said, King of Fighters 2000 is still a great import purchase for fighting fans and SNK diehards. A title that saw mucho playtime in the Dunham household (a home where we still firmly believe that King of Fighters 97 is quite possibly greatest fighting game ever made), KOF 2000 is what it is, and whether or not that hurts it or helps it is up to you.", "date": "Dec 2, 2002"}
