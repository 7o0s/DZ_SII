{"name": "Neo Contra", "name_review": "Neo Contra", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/19/neo-contra", "text": "is a baffling experience that involves aggravated alien blasting and frantic twitch shooting. It's also one of very few videogames that can be exquisitely described by the phrase, ~pulsating baby-monster explosion.~ Contra comes when a developer combines aliens, blasting, twitching, and baby-monsters into a single shooting package. Contra comes when the main character is some dude named Bill Rizer and he has a buddy the ladies like to call Jaguar. Contra comes when a developer says, ~Presto-whammo, let's throw in a aircraft carrier commanding dog named Animal Contra because that'll be frickin' cool.~ Only thing is, it takes a skilled Konami TYO developer to take these fundamentals of Contra to make an actually good game and not some kind of C: A Contra Adventure , which happened to be a worthless PSOne title that was disastrously beautiful, like a nuclear bomb hitting a flock of dolphins or something.Anyway! Neo Contra has the basics. There are mutated crab-babies, there's a doorstop that looks like a woman's privates but is supposed to be a ~hot dog bun with legs,~ and there is all the shooting and the Bill Rizer playing. Sadly, while the ingredients are the same, the directions on the box are way different. After Konami finished baking this one, it wound up tasting a lot different and a little worse.The first Contra was about side and forward-scrolling action. Super C, Alien Wars, and Hardcorps all implemented minor twists of their own, including overhead action, but managed to retain the basic side-scrolling fundamentals of the series. Since the PSOne trash doesn't count, we'll skip to Shattered Soldier, which revitalized the series with lots of sidescrolling and plenty of wow moments. And this is where Neo Contra goes wrong, mutated baby monsters or not... Yes! Mutant Babies Rule. Instead of relying on the underlying gameplay mechanics that have made good Contra games good Contra for over 15 years, Neo switches up the entire experience. It pulls the camera up and entirely forgoes classic sidescrolling in favor of a kind of ~dynamic~ action that follows the characters wherever they go. This makes for a more cinematic experience that pans, zooms, tilts, twists, and refocuses on specific areas, but it doesn't make for a better experience.Since this viewpoint switch necessitated that Konami remove the jump and prone moves, as well as the conventional eight-directional shooting, Neo really doesn't come off as Contra at all, save for the uniquely  clichd art style, gibberish storyline, and the actions of Bill and Jaguar, whom are lovingly portrayed in a variety of cutscenes.In place of conventional Contra's jumping, ducking, and horizontal to upward shooting, Neo features a few moves that are just as basic, but not nearly as refined. The first is the roll / standing bullet deflection, which acts as both a quick dodge and a temporary shield, but prohibits the players from firing for a couple of seconds. The next piece of new control is the stand in place spin, which allows Bill or Jaguar to turn in any direction and fire like a stationary turret. The third addition is the vertical lock-on... Imagine Contra's action taking place on two planes. The first plane is level with the player, while the second is directly above him or her. The only way to access the second level is to use the triangle bound lock-on function. Everything on the first level can be destroyed with normal weaponry, however. This is where the spin in place maneuver comes in handy. It allows players to stand in one spot, hold triangle, and then wiggle or swivel to lock-on to elevated units that need to be destroyed. Painting targets in this way really simplifies a task that would have otherwise been quite difficult. The final addition to the Contra mix is the strafe modifier. By holding L2, the player's sights are locked in a specific direction, which makes it relatively  easy to keep firing in one direction while moving in another.    Those are the new controls. Newness is not inherently bad, but these new controls happen to be limited to a fault. In making Contra more unlike Contra than any title before it, Konami has made the series into a next generation One or, more accurately, Loaded. It's really too bad that all the strafe modifying and rolling creates an experience that can be unintuitive and frustrating. If Konami was set in its ways and dedicated to making a new top-down, isometric, no jump, no sidescrolling game, they should have just bitten the bullet and made Smash TV or Total Carnage. This kind of control scheme could have one analog stick control movement, the other shooting, and the shoulder buttons could then have been used for weapon switching, rolling, and higher level targeting. Since this isn't the case, neo Contra feels more clunky than it needed to. Most of game time is spent flailing about, twitching to extreme degrees, and repeatedly re-snapping the strafe lock-on mechanism into place. That's just perfect, and it's really not Contra.Structurally, Neo is also not designed like a traditional Contra game. First, a second player can not join a singleplayer game that's already in progress. If you're playing and want to switch it up, you're actually going to have to reset the system, because there isn't even a quit option! Weapon use and accumulation is also much different. There aren't any actual upgrades in the game. Instead, Neo Contra offers a variety of preset weapon configurations. These include three different types of weapons. After the first play through we managed to unlock more weapon configurations, but you can't create your own configs and you can't modify them after the initial selection, so watch out. Eventually, we settled on a combination of Katana Jaguar with his Fire Katana, Lighting, and Heavenly Laser mixed with a Spread Shot, Fire Ball, and Thunder lock-on Bill Rizer model. This made our team unstoppable.  Jaguar's Ride Being unstoppable in Neo Contra isn't such a good thing, because it's a game that can be beaten in roughly 30 minutes (the first try will take about 45 minutes to an hour, promise). No joke. Ed and I teamed up and beat Neo Contra in 27 minutes. It's that easy. If you're looking for Shattered Soldier to the next level, you will be extremely disappointed. The challenge, actually, doesn't come with beating Neo Contra, but rather with getting a higher performance ranking. Contra rates performance based on a Kill Ratio. It's not hit accuracy, but rather how much you've actually killed in the level. Trust us, it's not hard to score a 100% hit ratio (especially on the third time through), but every time you die or continue, the game deducts percentile points. Getting 100% ratings unlocks the real ending and some extras. So, even though we can beat it in 27 minutes (I'm confident we could do it in less than 20 if we really tried), it's going back again and again to win perfectly that begins to create some of the lasting appeal. Of course, by lasting appeal we mean the increase from 20 minutes to one and a half days.Even if you can't come to grips with the control, and you despise the new weapon configurations, beating Neo Contra is definitely worthwhile (at least for the first time), because the CG is incredibly amusing, and all of the dialogue and cutscenes are so preposterous and brilliantly crazy that they just need to be seen. Meeting Mysterious G., Animal Contra, Pheromone Contra, Contra Master, and Guerilla Contra are some of the most memorably absurd moments we've had in recent gaming.Neo Contra is: 1) Different2) Short3) Plagued by a woefully inadequate presentation.4) Not an advancement.5) Mindlessly enjoyable for a time.6) Challenging.7) Incredibly hilarious.8) Fleeting.9) Not what anyone was looking for.Konami, give us back the jump. Give us back the eight-way shooting. Give us back Contra. If not, play Smash TV, ditch the strafe lock, and put in a few more levels.", "date": "Oct 19, 2004"}
