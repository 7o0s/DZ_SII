I bought a Samsung color-screen handset at an absolute premium back in 2002 just so I could get my mitts on Super Monkey Ball. So just downloading SEGA's latest Monkey Ball for mobile -- Tip n' Tilt -- was something of a pleasure for me. Would SEGA improve on the game that got me into mobile gaming in the first place?   Technically, Tip n' Tilt is indeed a better game than previous mobile Monkey Balls -- but still, this isn't going to move handsets anytime soon. The game is a 2D, side-scrolling variant on the Monkey Ball formula: You must manipulate the floor under a silly simian encased in a plastic sphere. Pressing left and right on the directional pad tilts a series of platforms that roll the monkey toward a target at the bottom of the stage. Along the way, you pick up bananas to bank extra lives.   It's a sound design and during the first third of the game, I was digging it. Of course, that was because I had been lulled into a false sense of security. Simple stages allowed me to master the art of rolling a monkey almost all the way down a platform before tilting it back at the last second to make the ball pop up and land on a nearby, but not connected, platform. I suspect that if you download the game and only read the score, you'll suspect I'm crazy with the heat.   Then you'll reach the middle third of the game. And between cursing and spitting, you'll feel my pain.   Tip n' Tilt shows zero mercy. You try to pop the monkey across gaps and time rolls just right to land on speedily moving platforms or collapsing stairs, but time and time again, you watch almost helplessly as your monkey rolls into sweet oblivion. Go ahead and kid yourself. ~I'll get it next time,~ you say. Say whatever you want. You will roll that monkey off the screen eight times on that particular platform. Once you do manage to master the sweet spot, a nearby bumper is ready to give you hell.   In addition to the main game, you also have a time attack mode and a challenge mode.   The game looks great. No, it's not some 3D-amazathon, but it has an extremely pleasing color scheme and vibrant visuals. This is the kind of playful atmosphere I really dig. The music is pretty god, too. There isn't much in the way of sound effects, save for the ~waah~ of the monkey falling off-screen. Get used to it.Yes, not every mobile game needs or should be as easy as making a cheese sandwich. But seriously, Sega, at least give the casual audience that games on their handsets a fighting chance. I suspect a lot of people that download this game because it has a title that implies the kind of fun you get out of a carnival game (not DChoc's Carnival games, ugh). That middle third will turn off 80-percent of them. And the surviving twenty-percent will be winnowed by the third tier of puzzles.", "date": "Sep 6, 2007"}
