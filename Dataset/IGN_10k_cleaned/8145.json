Oberon Media caught on to this underserved segment and struck fast to fill the catalog gap with Saints & Sinners Bingo.   The name is something of a misnomer, though. There are no actual saints and sinners in the game. Instead of angels praising the Lamb of Hosts or wretched souls gnashing their teeth at the throne of Old Scratch, you sally up to tables full of oddball characters like a clown, a biker, a highway patrolman, and a little old lady. In this cross-country tour of the biggest bingo halls the 48 has to offer, each unlocked by meeting specific requirements such as earning a set amount of cash, you'll be hard-pressed to meet a stranger cast for a casual game.   Saints & Sinners Bingo offers a multi-layered experience. Purists that just want to daub their lines can enjoy a regular game. To keep up the pace, the caller throws up three number balls at a time and starts a clock. You have to daub your spaces before the timer runs out or you lose the chance to nail those given numbers. After a couple seconds, you can manually call the next set of three balls.   However, Oberon has added a few extras that juice up the lazy nature of the game. (Although, to be fair, I have seen the inside of a bingo tent that was anything but lazy.) For one thing, there are extra ways to increase your winnings on each card. You don't have to call bingo right away. If you feel lucky, you can keep playing in hopes of filling in more lines on your card. There are bonus arrangements worth extra cash, like crosses or circles. The bonus arrangement is seen to the right of your card.   You can also interact with the other players. Ever-present at the bottom of the screen, these players will sometimes ask if you want a side bet. If you win the game, they will give you charms that act as power-ups. You can store these charms and use them in later games when the going gets tough and you spy a competitor daubing way more spaces than you. You can block moves, slow them down, and more. These two additions, charms and bonus arrangements, were wholly necessary to add extra strategy to a game that might have proved almost too leisurely for mobile.   Saints & Sinners Bingo has a busy interface, but at no point is it hard to navigate. In the halls, the screen is dominated by your card. The three number balls are easy to read. The character portraits along the bottom of the screen occasionally make a harmless quip that appears in a text balloon. This game isn't going to win any visual awards, but it gets the job done.  As a fan of bingo, I enjoyed Saints & Sinners Bingo. Without the extra mechanics like charms, though, my interest might have waned much earlier than I'd hope with a five-dollar game. The character dialogue is pretty tame for a game called Saints & Sinners -- if I wasn't going to get my hoped-for angels and demons, I would have been satisfied with some edgier comments. Maybe a cursing grandma? (With curse words appearing as Q*Bert-speak, of course.) The visual presentation is also a touch weak, but they manage to cram all of the necessary elements on-screen. In all, if you like bingo, you'll find good value in Saints & Sinners Bingo and I recommend it to fans of the parlor game.", "date": "Feb 28, 2007"}
