{"name": "Star Trek: Elite Force Expansion Pack", "name_review": "Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Expansion Pack", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/11/star-trek-voyager-elite-force-expansion-pack", "text": "It seemed like a perfect combination plate -- two new single player levels, a nice-sized pack of new maps, two new multiplayer modes, 10 levels of the Voyager to explore at your leisure, and the one and only Jeri Ryan's throat in both the expansion and the original game. It's always risky when add-on packs become cosmetic additions, but this seemed like pretty safe territory given that you'd still get your fix of multiplayer and single player games on top of being able to roam around Jeffries tubes and check out the computer core. Unfortunately, the Elite Force expansion ends up as too much of too little.  In the expansion, Voyager is yours to explore, though you'll have to do a little puzzle solving in order to gain access to certain areas like the private quarters of officers like Chakotay. You can head down to the Hazard Team level and check out all the locations from the first game, go to the Ten Forward and check out Neelix' recipe for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, see all the creatures you've encountered at Astrometrics... even explore the captain's personal quarters. The Tricorder has been added to your arsenal, so you can check out additional information on, say, a chair, or more importantly, use it as a radar for when you play through the new levels. Handy for when you want to hit someone in the back with a phaser blast, a rarely talked about Federation favorite.   The problem with all this is that you'll be able to explore the entire ship in about a half hour, not including puzzle time. And the problem with the puzzles is that they aren't that at all -- flipping a switch or clicking on a computer is about all you'll have to do to gain access to new parts of ship. Sure, this is just a tour and all, but if there aren't puzzles, and you can't really interact with any of the characters -- everyone, and I mean everyone is too busy to give you the time of day -- then you're just left with a really cool, empty map to run around in. Add to this the fact that you've seen a good chunk of the ship in the original Elite Force, and this comes off as much less impressive than you'd initially expect.  Of course, there's still the holodeck, and where there's a holodeck, there's also two new single player missions, a target practice screen, and a weird monster shooting arena that's a ~Tranquil Garden~ scene that malfunctions and sends beasts at you. The two levels are drastically different -- one is a black and white shoot 'em up based on Captain Proton, Tom Paris' favorite serial series. You'll head through a canyon and your arch-nemesis' base in order to free your honey from evil ugly tin can robots. The other level is a simplified version of the Klingon level from the original, with less emphasis on sneaking, and more emphasis on just blasting people in the head. Easy mode is a yawnfest, and even normal mode will be more than easy for anyone who's played an FPS. Both levels suffer from a lack of interesting level design, as well as any of the cool twists and turns that packed nearly every minute of Elite Force. While Proton's world looks fantastic, it plays more like an old straightforward shooter from five years ago -- and the Klingon level, while dark, moody and full of Klingon architecture, is incredibly short and simplistic. The weirdest thing is that not only are the new levels not good, but they're not even comparable to the teeny tiny holodeck levels you played between major missions in the original Elite Force. It's truly disappointing.  If you're talking totally new experiences, then you'd have to look to Multiplayer, which is where the largest additions have been made. Two new game types have been added -- Assimiliation, and Specialties mode. In Assimilation, you'll have to battle Borg opponents with other pals, since the AI bot teammates can't really go through the complicated task of blasting them while avoiding capture. Specialties is another retake on the Team Fortress/Counter Strike front, giving you special skills and abilities depending on your rank. Four new game types also give you some new variants on multiplayer, such as Action Hero, where the ~Action Hero~ on a map has regenerative health and all the weapons -- a tough opponent, but worth five kills if you can nail them. Elimination takes out an opponent for the rest of the match if they're killed, making for an instant tournament. Disintegration puts a compression gun in your hands that allows you an instant kill, making for a variant on the Rocket Arena. There are a good selection of maps to use as well, including some fan-designed maps, as well as more maps in the themes you love, like cowboy town (so maybe that's just my name for it). Because Specialties is a type of game rather than an entire mod, the full effect of having special team member with certain skills isn't as drastic as when you're playing a game designed around those concepts like Team Fortress. It's a nice addition though. Assimilation is more entertaining in concept than in action, unfortunately. New characters to choose from add to the multiplayer list as well, including the fun robot and other black and white characters from the Captain Proton universe. This isn't Team Arena in terms of new additions, but there's enough to keep you entertained... that is, if this wasn't the meatiest new addition in the group. The multiplayer definitely couldn't stand alone as an expansion to Elite Force, and yet it's the most thought out feature by far of the new ones available.  The decision to not make a straightforward add-on pack is commendable, and being able to explore Voyager is a geek's dream, but is there really enough here to fill an entire add-on? Unless you're a devoted fan of the show, or are still playing multiplayer Elite Force to death, I'd have to say no. The crowd of you out there that bought the original because it was a great shooter that also took place in the Star Trek universe are going to be disappointed, and overall, all of you are going to be disappointed in the lack of the stuff that made the original so great. This isn't so much an add-on as it is a completely different sort of game altogether, one that's simple and straightforward enough to make you antsy for the original again. Looks like you'll have to wait for the sequel for a true successor to Elite Force.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
