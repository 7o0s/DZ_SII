Even though the 3D graphics are a nice touch, it's not the real strength of the game. Panzer General offers the same turn-based action, which is the perfect antidote to the recent real-time trend of most strategy games. And although there's plenty of fighting, the game is all about equipment and leader management. Hey, that's what the generals do in real life. This focus on developing and using your subordinate commanders is the heart of the game and offers a nice change of pace from the usual homogenous unit types. Each leader has specific strengths that you'll need to use to achieve victory.  Each leader is assigned to one of the eight equipment classes. You won't want to put a tank commander in charge of your bombers. It is permissible, but your leaders won't get any of the cool benefits that they get when controlling their own equipment class. In addition, each leader can have one or two special abilities. There are over 40 of these in the game, and you'll need to pay attention to them in order to get the most out of your leaders. A leader with the Sixth Sense ability can not be ambushed. Units commanded by the Quartermaster leader suffer no penalty for multiple refits. The Ground Taker leader is more likely to force retreats when attacking.  Assignment and dismissal of leaders is handled from the Headquarters screen. Each leader has a promotion level that indicates the number of actions that he can take each turn. You can only have a fixed number of promotion levels within each battle. You'll therefore have to determine early on in the game whether you'll want a small force of really competent officers or a larger force of inexperienced officers. When you begin the game, most of your officers only have two or three actions. As you win battles, you'll earn promotion points that you can assign to your officers until they have 10 actions. Their available actions will increase, but they'll take up more space in your unit roster.  But the leaders by themselves can do very little. They're only a tool that you use to control the real might of your army, the individual units. You control eight different classes of units, and each class has many different types of available units. Infantry consist of Rangers, Paratroopers, Engineers and plain ol' foot soldiers. Fighters include Spitfires, P-38s, Hurricanes, etc. There are several other units within each of the Tank, Anti-Tank, Artillery, Recon, Air Defense and Bomber categories. Hinkfo on each can be found in the Headquarters screen. Just select a unit and a handy little reference card pops up with all the pertinent details.  Each unit is rated in three major areas--movement, fire and strength. A unit can move or fire up to its move or fire allowance or the promotion level of the leader, whichever is less. Each unit is further defined by several other characteristics. There are three different fire strength types, two defenses, movement allowance, spotting range, ammo, etc. All in all there's an astonishing variety of units to choose from here, and the smart general will pick the units best suited for his specific strategies. Like the leaders, many of the units have special abilities. Apart from the normal command orders and the numerous veteran specific orders, some units are capable of bridging streams, airdrops, support fire and fire suppression. I could go into a lot more detail, but let's move on to the actual gameplay.  The game is played on a battlefield that is, quite honestly, a little plain. There's a joke in there, but don't bother looking for it...it's just not funny. The battlefields are fairly realistic in terms of city and river positions, but you never get the feel that your pieces are rolling across real locations. Which is a shame because the pieces themselves look so good. A little more detail on the ground would make the experience a lot more believable. The ability to rotate the battle view as well as zoom in and out. Overall, I would have liked to have the option to move to more extreme vertical angles. You can't get too close to the ground or too high in the air.  Movement and combat is handled with a simple point and click interface that makes a lot of sense. The map is hex-based, but the borders are invisible. This is a nice compromise between using the hex system and maintaining credibility within the game world. When you select a unit, the areas to which it can move are displayed in green, targets are shown in red. The only problem I had with movement occurred when I tried to select planes. They are so far above the map that you can accidentally issue the wrong move orders while trying to click on them. The attack interface will bring up a small icon that gives you the estimated losses for both attacker and defender in each of the battles. That way, you can get a relative idea of whether or not it's worthwhile to commit your forces to an attack.   The only other problem I had with the combat screen was the unit roster at the bottom of the screen. Finding your units is a little bit of a problem when you've got two separate battles going on and fresh reinforcements speeding across the map. The unit roster is supposed to be the solution to this problem, but it just doesn't work well enough. First off, only six units are viewable in the roster at any one time. You can order them based on strength, type, remaining actions and the promotion level of the leader. That last one doesn't even make any sense to me. It just doesn't seem useful to sort the units on that basis. In any case, the sort order makes things a little easier, but it would just make more sense if you could see all your available units at once. Still, it's a minor problem.  The game offers four large campaigns. You can take command as Patton, Montgomery, Rommel or Guderian. Each campaign offers a unique challenge and theater of operations. In addition, there are four smaller campaigns focusing on the exploits of Kesserling, le Clerc, Patch and O'Connor. If long-term commitments aren't your thing, you can play as Liz Taylor or Warren Beatty. They take charge in over twenty scenarios, representing both real and theoretical battles in North Africa and the Western Front. Rather than allowing you to select basic difficulty levels (although that is an option, Panzer General 3D lets you set any of eight separate combat factors that give you or your opponents the edge.  Multiplay is offered through Mplayer, which, if you can get through the numerous entrance screens, allows you to go head to head with up to three other armchair generals. Just stay out of the professional general's room. Bradley'll kick your ass. While it's certainly rewarding to play against real opponents, the turn-based nature of this game tends to slow things down a lot. When it's your turn to play, you'll take all the time you want. But when you're waiting for the other players to finish their turns, you can get a little impatient. At least I can.  As I said before, Panzer General 3D gives you a great turn-based strategy fix. Some will claim that RTS is the more natural way to simulate battles, but who cares? As long as I'm having fun, I don't mind being reminded that I'm playing a game. Most new games are going RTS, and it's good to see that strong titles such as Panzer General and The Operational Art of War are resisting the urge. This one offers a lot of complexity and flexibility without bogging the player down in all sorts of ridiculous micro-management. The opportunity to direct your attention towards leader and unit management is a welcome one. After all, that's what real generalship is about.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Oct 7, 1999"}
