An arcade and console smash hit, the HOTD series was last seen on the Dreamcast a couple years back.  After a short hiatus, the Dead have returned exclusively to Xbox.  But don't expect your standard dead man party.  Aside from the stunning eye-candy graphics (hard to believe this was once all cel-shaded), House of the Dead III comes with a few big changes, including auto-reloading shotguns and a different type of branching pathway than what we've seen from Sega in the past.  Though you can possibly finish the game quicker than you can read this review, it is a heap of fun and worthy of the Dead.  Features  Fat zombies, skinny zombies, vultures, plant dudes, fast zombies, and more zombies than you can shake a light gun at! Choose between red and green blood Different paths increases replay value Includes House of the Dead II 5.1 Dolby Digital Only on Xbox   Gameplay Grab your light gun and get ready for some action.  House of the Dead III takes place twenty years after the events of II, with Lisa Rogan and Agent G looking into the disappearance of Thomas Rogan, Lisa's father.  The story, though, doesn't really matter.  Yes, you're looking for the elder Rogan and yeah there's some back story flashbacks strewn in between each level (six total), but all that really matters is that you're in a house of the dead and there are beasties everywhere looking to take a bite out of crimefighters.  You've got to blast your way through a horde of ungodly creatures and rescue Thomas Rogan.  Taking the role of either Lisa or Agent G (the only difference being one stands on the left and the other on the right), you'll enter the House of the Dead, which is actually a corporate office.  Well, I guess if these zombies work late enough hours they can call it a ~home~.  Anyone familiar with past Houses or, for that matter, almost any other light game, will get the grasp of things rather quickly.  There's one or two player mode and each player aims a crosshair and fires at everything and anything in sight.  But don't expect your standard House this time around, because WOW has shaken things up a bit.  In House of the Dead II, there were lots of innocents getting in the way.  If you killed one, which was easy (and fun) to do, you lost a life.  But in III, there are no innocents to worry about.  Instead, you've only got to sweat saving your partner from some hairy jams.  Occasionally your partner will be trapped and under duress from a few zombies.  The game pauses a moment, highlights the offending zombies in red, and then lets you at them.  Kill them all quickly and you'll keep Agent G from some nasty rashes.  And for a reward you'll snag a bonus life.  Move too slow, and G will take a hit, but you won't be penalized.  But saving innocents didn't just keep you from losing lives in HOTD II, it also changed the path of the game.  A saved innocent might give you a key or point you in a different direction.  But there are no innocents here, so that type of path divergence isn't possible.  That's a subtle change, something that can be easily overlooked.  But that wasn't enough for WOW, who took a huge gamble and stripped HOTD III of a shooter staple.  You won't hear anyone shouting ~Reload!~ as you play HOTD III, because this time you were smart enough to bring an auto-loading shotgun with you.  The shotgun has limited bullets, and when all shots are fired it will automatically reload, but this still takes time.  So if you are reloading and are still under attack, you could get screwed over.  But generally, that's not gonna be the case.  And though it seems like this would kill the game, because reloading was a key part of the originals, it's actually a boon.    House of the Dead III gives you more zombies, coming at a faster pace and bosses that will have your trigger finger swollen and sore by the end of the day.  You need the auto-reload because there's always something coming at you and the game very rarely lets up on the action.  There are also more things in the environment to shoot than in the past.  Blowing up boxes and oil drums reveals several different coins, which can add to your point total and thus increase your level rating at the end.  Still, the no reload feature makes the game easier than its predecessors.  So, you lose some of the challenge, but it's more fun than it ever was.  Alternate paths still exist in the Dead, but now are handled in a different way.  There are six levels and you can choose your path before several of them.  The first level is short and takes you through the last day Thomas Rogan was heard from.  Two weeks later, G and Lisa kick in the gates and you're given a choice -- take the parking lot or the entranceway.  Each takes you on slightly different paths, encountering different enemies and bonus coin placements.  The next three levels -- the bulk of the game -- can be chosen in any order you wish.  But your path will change for each one depending on the order you choose.  So, you can go through the game a few times, picking different combinations and see a variety of paths all leading to one inevitable confrontation.  Speaking of confrontation, House of the Dead III wipes the floor with the much-loved II in terms of boss battles.  Though there are only four bosses (you face one twice) each one is fantastically designed.  The attack patterns are easy to figure out and they're not as difficult as in the previous Deads (excluding the final boss), but the bosses are far more imaginative and enjoyable.  The best part of the game comes in a boss battle with a giant sloth-like creature whose cage you've stumbled onto.  As he circles you by hanging onto the chain-link cage, you have to blast at his hands and feet to try and knock him loose.  Not caring for that at all, Mr. Sloth Boss shakes the cage.  Cue It's Raining Men, because it literally is.  A dozen or so dead bodies hanging from the high ceiling fall towards you and your only hope for survival is to blast the corpses away before they splat you.  Genius.  The only disappointment comes with the final boss battle, which seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the undead at all.  The game suddenly shifts from ~undead blast-fest~ to ~lost scenes from The Lawnmower Man.~  Not to mention he's tougher than the previous three bosses combined (even if you fought those bosses with your eyes closed and the light gun pointed at your crotch).  But every challenge is worth its reward, and your reward here is a fun cut scene.  Hoorah!      When not fighting bosses, you'll be taking it to multiple variations of ugly.  Some of these zombies will be familiar from previous Deads (chainsaw anyone?), and some are squeaky-clean fresh.  You get bats, scarabs, big fat tubby dudes, vultures, super-fast zomboids, TV-wielding undead, electro-shock zombies, and more.  A good variety considering the length of the game (you can finish it faster than an episode of Friends).  Nothing here, though, is really all that challenging.  Fortunately, you can adjust life and replay tries as well as overall difficulty to give yourself a true run for your money.  While House of the Dead III is meant to be used with a light gun (one is set to ship from Mad Catz the same day as HOTD III), it's actually a blast with just the controller.  Yup, this is the first light gun game that seems made for a controller.  With the fast-paced action, you'll be shooting up a storm using the controller.  It's easier, since you can aim more accurately and usually fire more rapidly, but no less fun than with a light gun.  So, if you don't want to dish out the extra 35 bones for a gun, HOTD III can still satisfy.  But, real gamers go gun -- you decide which you are.  As far as the gun goes, the aiming seems much more accurate that in the previous Dead on Dreamcast (and the version included in III).  It's quicker, more reliable, and more enjoyable.  But it does take a while to get used to not having to reload.  The first few times playing, you may find yourself aiming off screen to reload for no reason.  And that's something that would have been nice to see in the game.  Some gamers will want the manual reload, which would have been a great toggle.  Though the game would have been tougher for those using manual reload, it would have been nice to see the option there.  If Sega wants your hard earned (or borrowed) fifty bucks, then the games got to have some replay value.  Like GUNVALKYRIE, House of the Dead III rates your gameplay performance between levels.  Get an A rating or better and you'll receive extra lives.  Finish the game with a high overall rating and you can unlock other goodies, like added footage to the final cutscene.  But that's not really enough, because the game can take less than a half-hour to beat.  Though there are five difficulty levels and varying paths to take, none of this adds up to significant playing time.  But then there's this little addition to HOTD III, unlocked when you beat the game on any difficulty setting -- House of the Dead II  That's right, you get the full, unedited version of HOTD II.  This baby is warts and all.  It's surprising to see, after playing III just how poor the graphics are and how stiff the gameplay feels with II.  It's hard to go back to the classic style of HOTD II when you've played a few games worth of III's stellar pacing and no-reload shooting frenzy.  The aiming seems a bit off and the voice acting is horrendous, but it's an unspoiled (and unrefined) translation of II.  Overall, House of the Dead II still feels good and is tougher than III.  It will probably take you longer to beat II than III and, in fact you probably won't beat the second House the first time through.  It's not too tough to beat all of HOTD III the first time out at the Normal difficulty setting.  But for fans (and count me in there), it's nice to have this one included.  The bosses aren't nearly as interesting as in III, but the classics never die.    Graphics Who'd think a light gun game would end up being one of the better looking games on Xbox?  House of the Dead III features stellar graphics, on par with other Sega Entertainment Xbox titles.  Lighting and color take center stage here as the things that go bump in the night don't look like drab old gray dead people at all.  Instead, you get various shades of decay and some fantastic animations.  Just look at the tubby guys giggle as they run at you.  And best (and grossest) of all is the ability to see through the holes you place in a fatty with your shotgun.  The shocker zombies, who must have been sadists till the day they died, carry electroshock prods which give off a brilliant blue glow.  This glow lights up the environment, as does every other source of light.  The backgrounds are thick with detail and every creature looks superb.  The game never lets up on action, which actually sucks, because there are times you'll want to just relax and enjoy the scenery.  Certainly the best looking console light gun shooter to date, House of the Dead III takes full advantage of its gameplay set-up (controlled environments with every enemy pre-scripted) to bring some gorgeous graphics to the 'box.    Sound The sound effects are often subtle, in HOTD III, so much so that those without a nice sound system may miss out on the oozing slime of destroyed plant beasts or the whomp of a fat-ass zombie hitting the turf.  The game features 5.1 Dolby Digital surround, but the effect is incredibly minimalized by the nature of the game.  Gunshots come from the center speaker and the three front speakers overall are used well.  You'll also hear the subwoofer boom from time to time.  But the rear speakers are primarily silent.  You don't really have things sneaking up on you in the game, so that half of the sound field is often dead silent.  But when the game turns you around, you will hear sound travel properly from rear to front speakers.  It's not so much that the designers were lazy and did a poor job, it's more that the game itself just isn't going to be able to fully utilize Surround Sound.    The score is minimal but good and when the action heats up, so does the music.  It's nothing too special, but it gets the job done.  Zombies don't really say much, so mostly you get grunts and groans.  The voice acting is a lot better than most horror games, but that's not saying much.  House of the Dead III does a nice job with what it has to work with.House of the Dead III certainly isn't for everyone.  But if you loved II or are just a fan of light gun games, this one's a definite keeper.  A good, straight-up, mindless shooter, HOTD III does something unique in that you don't really need a light gun to enjoy it.  Of course, purists will want to dole out the extra dough, but more frugal buyers can still have fun with the Controller S.  The game's biggest drawback is the length, which is too small even for a shooter.  The last boss seems to be totally out of place with the rest of the game and is much tougher to beat than anything else in that game.  Not in that ~yeah, the last boss is always hardest~ way, but in a ~Oh, Holy Moses! This damn thing is gonna tear me a new--~ sort of way.  Even with HOTD II included, you have to ask yourself, is it really worth the cheddar, especially if you want a light gun... or two?  Keep in mind, there are no other light gun games in the near future, so this is it.  That said, I've played through HOTD III over a dozen times and I'll likely continue.  But add even that up and time spent on HOTD II and, at best, you're looking at 10-12 hours of gameplay.", "date": "Oct 18, 2002"}
