When a game such as Colony Wars: Vengeance appears, and then within a few months, Eliminator arrives, you have to wonder who is making the calls. The first is a stunner, a great deep game, and the second, well, it's a simple, shoot-'em-up with the skin deep gameplay and simplistic design.   But maybe its Elminator's hard-core characteristics that make it a PlayStation game through and through, and Psygnosis felt it couldn't pass this one up. After all, Eliminator  which sets the gamer into a deadly race against time with a high-tech battle hover craft  doesn't stray away from what hard-core gamers really want, right? Shooting, action, cool futuristic weapons and ships? That's it right?   Well, maybe in the first and second year of the PlayStation existence this would have been a really cool concept, and could have truly been a must-have game, but not now. Now, Eliminator is, unfortunately, a ~been-there-done-that~ title. It's a game that looks and feels as if it should have been published in 1995 or 1996.   The object of the game is to take this killer experimental craft through a rigorous test of courses and past a number of inanimate and moving obstacles to beat the clock. What kind of clock? Well, that's a good one. Essentially, you have a bomb strapped to your back, and if you don't make it, the evil sentinels that run this desperate, futuristic camp will just find another sucker to make the grade.  With a slew of different courses and a relatively cool array of craft, you can move in any direction to reach your goal. The best feeling in the game is the sense of hovering, with the strafing coming in a close second. The controls respond quickly, and the courses are laid out in a slightly puzzlish pattern so that after you pass up one goal, gates open up for new adventures. The levels grow more difficult along the way and your weapons grow more powerful as well.   Don't get me wrong, Eliminator is a fun shoot-'em-up with all of the right things going for it, except...maybe timing and innovation. And yeah, those are big elements to a game, but games with less innovation and less fortunate timing have made it big on this system. After all, this kind of game is the bread and butter for PlayStation, but with so many other shooters on the market, why?   I'll answer my own question to illustrate the point. Blast Radius, Einhander, G-Darius, Ray Storm, and Thunder Force Five are all a little different than Eliminator, some are more classic, 2D, others are 3D and more unique. Eliminator actually feels a little bit more like Descent or Forsaken, in that it allows near 3D movement, whereas those two allowed complete 3D movement. It also is slightly reminiscent of these in its repetitive, nearly closed, or fully closed tunnels, arenas, and alleyways. But it's not quite as fun as either of those. Eliminator, is in fact, most like 3DO's Battlesport than any other game on PSX, and it's not as fun as that either.   In the end, a straight-forward shooter-style title like Eliminator needs a stronger hook, a more compelling set of tools  like a stronger game design with multiple levels of gameplay  to keep the game-rich PlayStation owner from passing right by this kind of title.
