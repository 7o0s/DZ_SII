This premature burial greatly incensed those of us who still remembered with great fondness the joy that titles like X-Com, Civilization and King's Bounty brought to us in our youth. Fortunately, just a few months later, titles like Warlords III and Heroes of Might and Magic II proved the genre could not only stand up on its own, but still had a following large enough to make it profitable for design houses that wanted to craft new turn based games. But lately, while sequels and spin off titles like Panzer General 3D and Heroes of Might and Magic III have enjoyed a great deal of success, there haven't been all that many new licenses created in the genre. Now it looks like all of that is going to change. A small Montreal developer, Strategy First, has just released a title that not only holds its own against the other heavy hitters already available on the shelf, but pushes turn-based strategy games as a whole in the right direction. With its deep storylines, rich gameplay and excellent multiplayer setup, Disciples is everything that a strategy freak could hope for.  The Story  To try and summarize the storyline of Disciples in a short paragraph would not only be a disservice to the game, but would also spoil a great deal of the dramatic tension that makes the game so addictive. Instead, I offer a quick introduction to the four races in the game a small bit of their history. Instead, we'll take a quick look at the four races involved in the struggle portrayed during the Saga games. First up is the Empire, a bold gathering of humanity at its best. The Empire is full of the classic Tolkeinesque Greater-Human sort of heroes, from tough Warriors and nimble Archers to wild Huntsmen and powerful Wizards. Having just hit the height of their greatness, this group is just discovering that peace and harmony can't last forever. After thousands of years locked away in the tumultuous world that he helped create, the powerful devil Bethrezhem has a chance to escape his punishment by laying waste to the land. Along with his twisted Army of the Damned, he seeks to wipe away the mistakes of his earlier creation and recreate the planet in his own image. The Army's units range from Berserkers and Cultists, soulless humans who have lost the power to fight the demons that tempt them to immense Gargoyles and Demons, true creatures of the pit. The Empire is not the only race that has a problem of godlike proportions to deal with. The Mountain Clans, the Dwarven followers of the god Wotan, are dealing with a horrible threat brought on by their god's devotion to victory. Long ago, Wotan struck down another god in a battle. When the fallen god's wife, Mortis, failed in her attempt to resurrect her spouse, her mind turned to vengeance. Wiping out an entire race, she brought their bodies back as the horrifying Undead Hordes. These foul minions of a crazed goddess turn the earth to corrupted wasteland as they spread across the realm seeking to embrace all races in their cloak of death. The Hordes boasts the greatest range of soldiers, from spell slinging Necromancers to Wraiths that can paralyze their foes with fear. But the Mountain Clans have plenty of powerful fighters of their own, from Dwarven Warriors and Novices (who can enhance the skills of their brethren) to other creatures of the Earth, the Hill and Rock Giants.  Even though the game starts with these two major rivalries, shortly into the story the paths of all these races become intertwined. At the beginning of each mission in the Saga mode, you'll be treated to a short animated (well, usually its just a moving shot of a still image) intro that brings you up to speed on the events that have led to the current conflict. The story is full of twists and turns that do an excellent job of portraying a huge war in the middle of a magnificent fantasy world in a realistic light. In the saga mode, each race has its own story to uncover, so you'll definitely find yourself coming back to this game again and again after beating it to find out the motivations and secrets behind each of the four races.  The Game  So what about the gameplay itself? I have to confess, the first few hours I spent with Disciples were not the best in the world. The game doesn't look nearly as sharp as a lot of other games out there and its basic gameplay structure is highly derivative of games like Heroes of Might and Magic and Warlords. But if you're a real strategy fan, after about an hour you'll start to realize not only that there are major difference between Disciples and other titles that are out there, but also that the things that the game does copy, it copies very well.   Unlike the traditional grab the flag capture the building setup of other turn based games, Disciples works on a ground conquered principle. Each turn your starting base and each of the towns you hold will start to spread your influence over the ground in the surrounding area. Any resource generating buildings within your influence devote their resources to your cause. If you want to change land over that's far away from your bases (to gain a mana generating shrine or a gold mine for instance), you'll need to build a special unit (for the Hordes its the Banshee, for the Empire its an angel, etc.) that is capable of placing rods. Once a rod is placed, it will place all of the land immediately around it under  the control of the player placing it. Since only rod placing units can remove another player's rod, this one game device creates a dynamic that can result in huge wars in and of itself.  Another way in which the game differs from traditional turn based games in is its approach to experience and unit creation. Like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples gives each player a central base where they can construct different buildings that determine which units they will have access to. Unlike Heroes though, these buildings determine how a creature will evolve after gaining enough experience points. These upgrade structures often follow different paths, so that once you build one, you cannot go back and build the others. Since all of this is a little confusing in a text format, let's look at an example. You're playing as the Undead Hordes and decide that you'd like some foot soldiers to go out and kick some Dwarf ass. The first thing you'd need to do is to hire a few Warriors which are the basic fighting unit for the Undead, available to you at the beginning of the game (without any special buildings). You take these units out on the battlefield (along with a suitable leader) and kill a handful of Dwarves. To ensure that these units upgrade when they gain enough experience, you head back to your castle and build either Unholy Ground, which will cause your Warriors to upgrade to Zombies, or an Evil Monastery, which will turn them into Templars. Once you've built one of these buildings, you can no longer build the other, or anything along the upgrade path followed by the other. If you've chosen the Unholy Ground, you'll later want to build a Graveyard, which will turn experienced Zombies into Skeleton Warriors. If you've chosen Evil Monastery, your next purchase would be a Dark Idol, which will enable your Templars to evolve into Dark Lords.  Like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples will allow no army on the field without a leader. Each race has five different leader types at its disposal, three of which are actually intended for field command. The three field command types are each oriented to one aspect of campaigning, hand-to-hand combat, magic, or scouting. The other two types are the rod planter, which is described above, and the thief, which is used for reconnaissance and subterfuge. These last two units can't carry many units with them into battle at low level so they tend to be used only for specialty missions rather than direct confrontations. As a leader gains more experience points, they too will gain levels. Unlike units who evolve though, leaders instead get to chose from a list of powers each time they gain a level. These powers include the ability to use artifacts, banners or magic tomes, leadership, which allows a leader to carry more units into the field, or personal upgrade which give the leader more hit points or make him do more damage in battle. The end result of all this experience decision making is that your army feel highly personalized after you've been out in the field for a while. The down side is, when you loose a powerful unit, you'll feel it deep down inside.  The Wrap-up  While Disciples doesn't look all that good (the actual play graphics look like something from the early 90's), it's powerful artistic design and sound effects still do an excellent job of delivering a dark and ominous feel to the game. All of the characters in the game are portrayed with beautiful (and creepy) drawn art (in the character screens, the less said about the actual battlefield graphics the better) that gives you an excellent idea of the unit's nature. Backing these images up are eerie vocal tracks that are played each time the unit is selected or moved. The voice acting here is pretty good and serves up a good insight into the nature of the unit itself (the Banshee cries, ~where are you?~ to a lost love for example). Best of all, the game offers up an excellent soundtrack that really puts forth a feeling of decay, terror and urgency.   There's really a lot more that could be said about Disciples (I didn't even get started on the magic weapons and spells in the game), but I've covered the most important elements. The bottom line is this: if you like detailed strategy games and don't mind staring at some less than hi-tech images while you play them, then Disciples is a title that you need to go out and buy. Now leave me alone, I've got a kingdom to destroy...  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Oct 19, 1999"}
