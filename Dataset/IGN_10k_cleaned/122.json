Ronald McDonald, The Noid, Cool Spot and Chester the Cheetah have all graced a video game or two. But for some unknown reason, the M&Ms have seen more titles than most of the others combined. It's strange, considering that these bite-sized candy spokespeople do nothing that would warrant an entire video game. Developer Frontline has failed to prove that the candies deserve the video game treatment. Their newest title, M&M's Kart Racing leaves a bad taste in our mouths.   Apparently it's not enough that the M&Ms are disturbingly sentient candies that promote the genocide of their species, they also have lead feet. It's feels like kart racing is the kind of game a developer makes when they get the rights to a property they're too lazy to showcase properly, and this kart racing fiasco emphasizes that point.   Are you a fan of those candy-coated comedians? Probably, since you're bothering to read this, so you might be hoping the game is at least slightly entertaining.   Sorry we have to be the bearer of bad news.   As a mascot game, there is nothing redeeming about M&M's Kart Racing. All the characters are in vehicles, so you can't even see them properly. You can see a circle of color that represents their back if you're in a small vehicle, but most of the time there's nothing to see. The tracks, besides a candy factory, have nothing to do with the product. We're M-&-Freaking-Ms here, why are we driving around a jungle inhabited by giant spiders?   We're playing with Orange. He's behind that propeller blocking most of the track. The only voice work is a ~whoohoo!~ for when the kart jumps, and it's the same sound effect for every racer. There are no witty one-liners. There aren't even lame one-liners.   Ignoring the fact that this game makes no effort to get me to buy confectionary treats, M&M's Kart Racing is just a plain bad racer. Oh sorry, make that a ~Milk Chocolate~ bad racer.   The whole single player tournament mode is barely a game. There's no progression whatsoever. At the end of each race we get kicked back to the vehicle select screen, and have to work our way back through the painfully slow menu system to play the next level.   The game does keep track of the points we earn through the tournament, but doesn't have a problem with us replaying tracks for more points, or even switching characters and letting them earn points. Turns out the points don't mean much of anything and can be manipulated as the player sees fit.   There's also a ~Time Trial~ mode that has the player race around as fast as possible to try and collect time boosts. It doesn't actually record your time, or have any purpose whatsoever.   The courses are pretty uninspired and unoriginal. There's a jungle, an ice level, a racetrack, and not one, but two, space levels. We're not sure why the candies are racing in the Coliseum of ancient Rome, but it's really boring. Some of the tracks are ridiculously long, one lap races. The long tracks still repeat the same curves and obstacles so it manages to feel like a tiny track anyway.   We couldn't see much of the repeating elements since the draw distance on the game is abysmally small. Every track is shrouded in mist, so that even in the sweeping, panoramic shots before the race we can't see anything. For instance, on the race track stadium, the mist obscures large portions of the stands, so it's hard to tell if it's a stadium at all.   The game is absurdly easy, which is nice because controlling the karts is a pain. Turning causes the kart to turn, but not the camera. The camera shifts back after we're done turning. If it wasn't for the fact that these chocolates race slower than molasses, we would have been getting frustrated with the horrible controls.Commercial mascots make terrible videogames. M&Ms should be the mascot for bad mascot games. M&M's Kart Racing has nothing to do with the candies, and barely uses the license at all. Even if there had been original characters, this game looks, plays and sounds terrible. It brings nothing new to kart racing, and doesnt even manage to get the fundamentals right. Stay away from these candies, they'll spoil your appetite.", "date": "Apr 2, 2008"}
