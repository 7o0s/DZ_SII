Despite its simplicity, there is no such thing as ~mastery over Tetris~ and perhaps that's one of the most appealing things about Tetris.  And it wouldn't seem right for any console not to have a Tetris game, though SEGA didn't just want the same old Tetris on the Dreamcast.  Let us introduce The Next Tetris: On-Line Edition for the Dreamcast, and for legions of Dreamcast owners, this is a godsend.  A Tetris game for the Dreamcast with online play!?!  Finally, Tetris players everywhere will be able to see who can drop blocks with the quickest speed and keenest precision.  First off, the details... The Next Tetris actually features two games: The Next Tetris with some added gameplay mechanics, and the classic version of Tetris.  The latter needs no introduction; just continue to match block pieces as long as you can, as the falling speed of the block pieces increases the longer you play.  The Next Tetris game has added a few gameplay changes, most notable ~cascading~.  When playing in the new mode, you'll start to notice that a few Tetris pieces will consist of different colored blocks called Multiminos.  When a Multimino is placed, it then separates into blocks of its own color.  If the colors of the blocks don't match, they separate and fall down if there is space below.  This ~cascading~ feature allows players to drop blocks down after you initially make a horizontal line disappear.  It's an interesting play mechanic, one that allows you to clear five or more lines in one ~combo~.  The cascading play mechanic is especially useful when play in a two-player game, as you can make life more difficult for your opponent as you clear multiple lines.  As you clear more lines, you can make the opponent's playfield spin vertically, horizontally, and diagonally depending on how many lines clear. If you cascade blocks to clear them, you can make the playfield spin numerous times, darken the opponent's view, and change all the pieces into the same color (preventing your opponent from cascading).  Though these obstructions seem trivial at first, they can really make life a living hell for the other player.  And if this ~cascading~ stuff is not to your liking, you can always go back to playing the classic two-player Tetris.  Then comes the online play and there was no noticeable lag times when I played against online opponents... not that I expected any for a game like Tetris.  One thing that perturbs me is the lack of keyboard support, so there's no taunting or chatting while online  just a simple challenge or acceptance of a challenge and you're in the game.  What was disappointing when I got online was the lack of Tetris players.  During my online experience with this title, I only got to play two players, not because I was afraid of the challenge, but because no one came online to play.  I guess there aren't many hardcore Tetris players that take advantage of The Next Tetris's online features.  Visually, the game is...well, it's Tetris so you can't expect too much eye-candy, if any.  There industrial-like menu presentation and 3D background ~noise~ during gameplay is nice, while at the same time, not distracting.   While all the gameplay action is in a 2D plane, the blocks and playfield are in 3D, demonstrated specifically when the playfield starts spinning in a two-player game.  The music and sounds are decent, as the music is a mix of trancy, dreamy melodies that seem to inspire intelligent thought. The Next Tetris: On-Line Edition is certainly a solid game; with an online competitive feature as well as new play mechanics, it would certainly be a nice purchase for any Dreamcast owner.  That's where the final determining question comes into play: do you want to drop 40 bucks for a Tetris game with online play?  I think many people who are Tetris addicts (i.e. Chris Carle of IGN Guides) will rush to the store and get on-line right away.  And while I'm not obsessed with putting blocks in the right place, like I said above, every console needs its Tetris.     --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Jan 26, 2001"}
