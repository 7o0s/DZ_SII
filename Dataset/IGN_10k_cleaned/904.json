But even with that in mind, Konami cranks out a Game Boy version of its winter games series. And even though it's not a very timely release, the game is still great fun on the go. Small problems here and there, but a worthy game for fans of the multi-event sports genre. Features: Eight events Challenge and Championship modes Battery Back-up Only for Game Boy Color  Millennium Winter Sports is Konami's International Track & Field in the snow. This eight-event championship puts you in the role of a Joe Everybody that excels in all sorts of winter sports. You can choose to play the full eight-event championship, or play them one at a time in the Challenge mode. The only thing about the Challenge mode is, only four events are available right off the bat. You have to unlock the rest by earning medals in the first four events.  And here they are: Ski Jumping 90m/120m: In these events you'll have to not only time the wind direction, but also how fast you ski down the slope (by pressing the A and B buttons as fast as possible), when you leap off the edge of the plank, and at what angle you sail through the air. All these factors together make for an interesting time. Downhill:  Strap on the skis and shush down the slope  but make sure you zoom through each of the flags on the track. Make it down the slope in the shortest amount of time. Giant Slalom:  Very similar to the Downhill, but this time you've got a snowboard attached to your feet. Again, make it down the track in the shortest possible time, but make sure you're weaving between the proper flags. Speed Skating:  Here's a great big ice rink. It's up to you to speed around the track against a computer opponent by timing your left and right feet. If you can't sync up the power bars, then you'll find yourself lagging behind badly. Half Pipe: Here, you'll have six opportunities to show the judge how well you can pull off stunts. You decide how difficult the trick will be by timing an arrow within the powerbar  mis-time the jump and you lose your opportunity. To pull off a stunt, you have a short amount of time to follow a series of joystick commands.  Freestyle: Very similar to the half-pipe, but this time you're on skis. In this case, though, the trick is decided for you  and it's your job to make sure your speed is up (by tapping the A and B as fast as you can), then follow the joystick commands to pull off the stunt. You'll also have to time a button press to land, otherwise you lose points on style. Bobsled: Always a favorite in winter games  simply control a giant sled down a sloped grove in the ice. Make sure you don't hit the sides, otherwise you'll lose precious speed and add penalizing seconds to your time.  Of all the events in the game, I have to say I dislike the Downhill and Giant Slalom. In these events, you're skiing down the screen  unfortunately, you have no prior knowledge of what's approaching other than where the gates will appear, indicated by icons at the bottom of the screen. It's extremely difficult to play these levels, and I found myself disqualifying them simply because I had no idea that a sharp curve was approaching.  The rest of the events, however, are a lot of fun and will last a good while simply because most of them are timing events  and we all know that our reflexes vary from day to day...  The unfortunate thing about Millennium Winter Sports  no multiplayer support. Let's ignore the fact that link-cable support was omitted in this game for a second, since most of the eight events are single player anyway  there's just no way of actually competing against a friend. I mean, in this case it would have made sense to play the old ~hot potato~ way by handing over the system when it's the other player's turn. But the developers didn't do that here  the only competition is between yourself and unseen computer opponents. I feel this is a pretty major design flaw, since a game like this would benefit highly from the competition between friends.   What we have here is a mixed bag of nicely put together games. My biggest complaint is in how they designed the downhill events  I really need to see what's coming up, and not have to guess when the turn is approaching. And the lack of multiplayer is a damn shame. Other than these little quibbles, Millennium Winter Sports is a great surprise. Excellent graphics, nice control, and a decent interface all around. I thought it was going to be a thrown-together game for the amount of promotion Konami gave the game (almost none), and what I got was a well-produced winter package. If you lived and breathed Epyx Winter Games a long time ago like I did, this is your game.", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
