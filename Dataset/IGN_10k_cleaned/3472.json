{"name": "Rayman 3", "name_review": "Rayman 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/05/rayman-3-5", "text": "One of the very first games released on the Game Boy Advance was a port of the original Rayman, previously released on the PlayStation, Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and PC several years prior. Rayman Advance was a great title to show off the new and drastic change in hardware capabilities of the Game Boy Advance, as the original Rayman, despite its somewhat high difficulty level, was a solidly designed platformer that really put to use a lot of vivid and vibrant color palettes, large sprites and fluid character animation. And Digital Eclipse's conversion was pretty spot-on compared to the original design released in the mid-90s. But as good as that game was during the GBA's launch, Ubi Soft has definitely upped the ante with Rayman 3 on the handheld, a game that expands on the existing Rayman gameplay with both familiar and enhanced abilities, brand new level designs, as well as an incredible focus on system connectivity. Features More than fifty different levels GameCube connectivity Link cable support (four players multi-cart, two players single-cart) Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 hits the Game Boy Advance at the same time as UbiSoft's more publicized console versions, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox adventure, Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. The Game Boy Advance version may be without the subtitle, but the handheld edition features some of the same situations and gameplay designs that were injected into its console counterpart. In this adventure, Rayman (the guy with the Craig Kilborn hair as well as a distinct lack of arms and legs) heads off into dangerous territory after his pal Globox disappeared after eating something called a dark lum. The story isn't quite as extravagantly told on the GBA as it is on the consoles, as the portable version's plot is driven by simple still screens and text...not as elaborate as the hugely animated and narrated cutscenes of the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, but they do the job. And the still screens look absolutely stunning on the GBA's LCD screen thanks to the high color palette.  The game design of this sequel definitely uses the original Rayman as a foundation; most of Rayman 3 takes place in a brilliantly colorful side-scrolling environment, and at the beginning of the game Rayman only has a fraction of the abilities he'll have towards the end of the game. Like the previous 2D Rayman design, players run, jump, and climb through the environments, collecting orbs and freeing teensies by smashing open cages scattered around the area. The side-scrolling environments are only one part of the game, as the designers add a lot of variety with other styles, including Mode 7-style 3D action rounds. One design is a cool Mario Kart-type challenge where players zoom around tracks collecting their orbs within a set amount of time and a set amount of laps. In other levels, players do a little Jet Skiing around swamps, pulled by Rayman's snake friend. Both these levels (as well as several 2D gameplay elements) are inspired by the console Rayman 3 counterpart, which shows how closely the handheld design team worked with the console design teams. The early levels wean players into the Rayman gameplay by offering a gentle learning curve, which definitely works better for the sequel as the original Rayman Advance was one of the most difficult (and frustrating) platformers around. Rayman 3 features more than fifty different levels in its adventure, which can be completed in a decent amount of time. A weekend play session is all that's really needed to complete the game at its minimum requirements, but the designers work replay into the game by unlocking features and levels as players complete challenges at a 100%. Sure, you can end a level just by reaching the end, but if you don't collect all the orbs or smash all the cages in an area, you'll never see everything. And what's more, some early areas have orbs and cages tucked away in locations that can't be reached without earning a specific Rayman technique, so players will have to revisit certain levels later in the adventure in order to complete them.  As solid and challenging as the adventure is, it does end after a few hours of play. But the Game Boy Advance development team put an amazing amount of focus into extending the longevity of the handheld design with its connectivity feature. Players who finish the main quest can still take advantage of some pretty fun multiplayer challenges; most of the multiplayer modes (tag, bandit, bumper cars) require a cartridge per each system, but the team has also included a basic two-player challenge that only needs one copy of the game. It's not much more than a game of Space War using Rayman characters, but it's wonderful that the development team put a huge effort into link cable support. And even better, players can connect the GBA version to the GameCube Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc and download brand-new level challenges to complete. The company even puts some clever GBA connectivity to use in the GameCube game, but they don't require the GBA game to play...just the system. The Rayman 3 GBA team deserves kudos for its emphasis on the game's connectivity, and hopefully they'll set an example for other GBA developers to follow. Rayman 3 is also one of the most ~alive~ games released on the GBA. The developers not only take advantage of the large color palette to paint lush and detailed backgrounds, but they've also create some very clever, fluid animations for the Rayman character, using his segmented body to move and contort him in order to create a very ~cartoony~ feel to his motions. He may lack arms and legs, but the mind fills in the gaps thanks to the animators' attention to detail. The audio is just as crisp and happy as the graphics and fit the mood extremely well, with digitized samples of character ~jibberish~ used in the last console Rayman game. The music is of high quality, sample wise, but the tunes tend to repeat themselves a bit too frequently. A minor complaint for a very thorough presentation. The original Rayman was a great Game Boy Advance experience, but its level of difficulty was a real turn-off. The team responsible for Rayman 3 on the Game Boy Advance took what was great about the original game, expanded upon it with new abilities, and created some extra levels revolving around similar designs on the console versions. Add in one of the most thorough attempts at multiplayer and GameCube connectivity in a GBA game, and the result is a wonderfully deep action platformer that offers a lot of fun and challenge on the handheld.", "date": "Mar 5, 2003"}
