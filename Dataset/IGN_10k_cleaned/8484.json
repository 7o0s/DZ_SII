Whether it's substantial enough to warrant its own DS cart is up for debate. For those unfamiliar with the classic card game, it involves distributing a deck made up of cards that each have a number and a color. A card is placed in the middle of the table, and players take turns covering the top card with one of their own, matching either the color or the number. The idea is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. Anytime a card can't be placed, more must be drawn and there are loads of special cards that speed up the process or punish the other players. When players get down to just one card, they must shout ~Uno!~ or else take two additional cards for their silence.    Uno 52 is a variation of that game where the deck is made up of 52 standard playing cards (deuce to ace) and split into four colors instead of four suits. Essentially, players are enjoying Uno and Poker simultaneously, by alternately getting rid of cards in the center of the table (Uno) and swapping them out in a 5-card hand off to the side (poker). At the end of each hand, both the player without any cards left and the player with the best poker hand share the winnings.    And that's really all there is to Uno 52 on the DS, which lacks any additional modes or gameplay variations. DSI and Black Lantern have released 5 different Uno-themed games in the past few months, including a collection of three other games (Uno, Skip-Bo and Uno Freefall) on one DS cart. With this release, Uno 52 is running solo. It's a shame that these games are being marketted separately, instead of as one larger Uno package. Although undeniably fun, all the Uno variations are pretty shallow, so a compilation release would have increased their value and made them a pretty essential buy. Released by itself though, Uno 52 is a game that will probably only appeal to fans of Uno 52.    In terms of graphics, presentation and options, the game looks identical to its GBA counterpart, except that everything has been stretched onto two screens. What looked charming and lively on DS looks tiny and sparse here. There are plenty of options available in regard to how many players, how many game-controlled players, music, avatars, names, backgrounds, difficulty, game length, music/effects volume and a robust tutorial section, but the menus are unintuitive and filled with annoying inconsistencies. The developers did put a good amount of effort toward gameplay instruction though, including which poker hands beat others and why.       Something the developers didn't handle so well was the betting. The game features a nice poker-like chip system, but it's completely automated so players can never raise or lower their bet per hand. Players bet a single chip with each hand, and the first player to dump their cards gets 10 chips, while the player with the best poker hand (who can be the same player) gets 5 chips. I'm not sure if adjustable bets would have been against traditional Uno 52 rules, but it would have added to the strategy and risk of the game. As it stands now, the betting is barely noticeable and players will probably just ignore it.    The main game mode pits one player against three AI opponents. Oddly enough, all three opponents' poker hands are visible to the player at all times. Up to 4 live players can play the game in a local wireless multiplayer mode, but like the previous Uno DS release, this requires a copy of the game for each participant. Considering how minimal the graphics and music are in this game, there's really no reason it couldn't have featured single-cart multiplayer. And as with the other DS release, shouting ~Uno!~ can't be done with the DS microphone. Instead, the player is required to tap a tiny text icon at the top of the touchscreen. It's difficult to remember in the spur of the moment, and it's one more missed opportunity in a game that's already full of them.Uno 52 is an enjoyable game that's less enjoyable on the Nintendo DS. What worked well in a GBA game feels empty and lazy on the DS. Compared to the previous DS Uno game, which offered 3 different game modes, there isn't much incentive to pick this release up. Uno 52 addicts will get a lot more bang for their buck by picking up the superior, cheaper GBA version of the game. Uno fans in general should look into the other DS release, or save themselves fifteen bucks and pick up a deck of cards instead.", "date": "May 17, 2007"}
