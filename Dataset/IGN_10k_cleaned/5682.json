Thrilling cinematic combat, a slick visual style, and an interesting fusion of diverse philosophies all set it in sci-fi setting helped to make The Matrix a bona fide phenomenon when it was originally released. As with all successful brands, sequels and video games were inevitable. The Matrix Online, developed by Monolith and published by Warner Bros. is the latest continuation of the franchise.   At first glance, the world of The Matrix seems to provide the perfect setting for a massively multiplayer game. The whole setting of the films even mirrors the mechanics of a massively multiplayer game and provides a handy justification for the somewhat arbitrary conventions of the genre. Things like player death, instant travel, and logging out all have readymade explanations within the context of the Matrix.  The game really captures the franchise beautifully both in terms of content and appearance. The whole game takes place in Mega City, a vast metropolis of steel skyscrapers and grimy alleyways. You'll meet the same types of characters you've come to know from the films: ardent Zionists trying to free mankind, cold Machines interested in keeping the system going and enigmatic Exiles going about their own mysterious aims.  Though there's a truce among all three factions, it's pretty much falling apart right from the start of the game. From what we can glean, there's a greater conflict coming among the three groups. The instant you start working for one of the organizations, you're bound to start losing face with the other two. While it provides for a nice sense of conflict, it can make the betrayals of the truce a little unsurprising. I remember running a mission where I was supposed to cooperate with another faction; when they turned on me, my contact was all, ~Wha?!?~ and I was all, ~Yawn.~  I've read in countless interviews that the agents are the end-all-be-all of Matrix enemies. I've had my own run-ins with that type, the type that can kill you before you even notice they're around. But I've also had the chance to beat the living crap out of an agent who was chasing me in the streets. I wasn't sure how that fit in to the game's overall scheme but it didn't really seem to ring true given the reputation the agents have in the films. I've since learned that these weaker, ~fake~ agents are part of the evolving storyline of the game.   You're free to explore just about any area you like, from the subways to the penthouses. You'll appreciate the near total lack of loading zones as you move from one area to the next. The openness of the world is pretty attractive right at the start but the sense of exploration you get from the variety found in fantasy worlds is gone here. Like City of Heroes, the world of The Matrix Online eventually starts to seem like an endless succession of buildings and parking lots. Though the city is massive, there's no real immediate reward for exploring the city. (The thrill of hyperjumping from rooftop to rooftop is the obvious exception.) Given that all the vendors and mission contacts are pretty much right there on the in-game map, you'll rarely find yourself going on a sightseeing tour.  But before you jump into the Matrix, you'll have to figure out just who you want to be. When you create your character, you'll pick one of ten broad archetypes. The only difference among them (besides the basic description of each) is that each gets different base ability scores. Though the creation tool tells you what each of the stats is good for in general terms, it would be nice to have a more detailed breakdown of how each stat affects gameplay. I know Focus and Perception are both important to combat characters but I'm not sure exactly how they matter. You'll eventually have the chance to define your characters skills and abilities by uploading codes. I know Kung Fu and so forth.  Though you can pick and upload any skills you want at any time, the skills are grouped into large trees that define your character as an operative, a hacker or a coder. There are various subtrees within each specialization that allow you to further refine your character. Operatives, for instance can opt for direct combat or ranged combat, specializing even further as sneaky infiltrators or masters of a particular school of combat. On the surface, these types seem very distinct but all have their counterparts in the world of fantasy MMOs. Hackers are the spellcasters of the world, for instance, able to become wizard-like Virologists or cleric-like Patchers.   WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW     Even though the character types follow standard models, there's a great sense of character advancement and freedom in The Matrix Online at nearly every level, you'll have access to some new skill or ability that opens up new opportunities for you. This is truer of the combat classes than the others but each class is going to get a little bite of that carrot as they move up in level. Better still, since each ability is represented by a piece of code, you can unload an entire skill set and try out a new one. This lets players try out a variety of roles with the same character. The memory limit (sort of like the learning capacity of Galaxies) ensures that you'll have to specialize to stay competitive.  Once you enter Mega City, you'll be able to call up your Zion contact on a cell phone and get your critical missions from her. After you've managed to prove yourself, agents of the Machines and the Merovingian will contact you and you can decide to start working for them. Either way, you'll instantly be able to call your primary mission giver to obtain the next main mission or, eventually, a variety of dynamic random missions. Having this kind of access to your mission giver eliminates a lot of pointless running and makes the experience of playing The Matrix Online much more convenient.   The choice of which faction to work for is largely incidental at this point. Running missions for Zion, the Machines or the Exiles is going to be pretty much the same. This is likely to change as more story elements are introduced by the in-game actors. Meeting up with real characters played by real actors makes an amazing difference in your perception of the game. Having a real person respond to your comments really encourages you to start roleplaying and taking the game seriously. I'm hoping more of these elements will be added soon because they really set The Matrix Online apart.  The regular missions you get from the NPCs in the game are pretty monotonous. Basically, they all involve going to an apartment or office and either killing everyone you find, grabbing an item or picking up someone and escorting them to a new location. Even when you start selecting the randomly generated missions, you still can't break free from these basic patterns. On the plus side, the missions are all relatively short and easy to take on without the benefit of a group.   In addition to the repetition of the missions, the enemies themselves are largely monotonous. At least EverQuest and City of Heroes offer superficial and cosmetic differences for the rank and file. As it is in The Matrix Online, the different enemies you face are barely even separated by their wardrobe. Admittedly, the game can't make use of goblins, aliens, zombies but the enemies and factions here eventually blend into one indistinct mess. The only real difference here is if the enemy in question has a gun and if they're wearing a shirt.   If you're not interested in running missions, there are other activities to be enjoyed in The Matrix Online, but unlike games like Star Wars Galaxies, there are no substantial rewards for hanging out in dance clubs.  No matter what role you choose to play in The Matrix Online, you'll definitely have to engage in a lot of combat. I've seen a lot of people liken the combat in this game to rock, paper, scissors. I have no idea why everyone is jumping on this description but it's a major oversimplification. It's true that there are three attack types (and one block) and that certain attacks are better at breaking through certain attacks of your enemy, but comparing it to rock, paper, scissors is ignoring the other elements that influence your success in combat. There are also a wide variety of fighting skills that offer up new moves you can try in combat.  From a purely visual standpoint, the combat in most MMOs has seemed a bit disjointed; opponents attack and react in concert with each other but there's been very little sense of connection between them. Combat in The Matrix Online makes use of a new interlock system that ties opponents together and creates much more believable animations. Since the animations for attacks, blocks, staggers, and so forth are all designed to synch up with your enemy's animations, you'll really see characters toss one other around, kick one another in the groin and head butt one another. Though there are some odd collision and clipping problems here and there, the overall effect is very pleasing. You'll still seem some odd moments where the lag spoils the effect. Fairly frequently you'll get the experience reward for killing an enemy before they're even killed.  There are some downsides to the interlock system however. For one thing, it makes it more difficult to disentangle yourself from combat. In most MMOs getting out of combat merely requires you to turn your back and run. The Matrix Online requires you to perform a special move to disengage from combat; if you're badly hurt, this extra move could mean the difference between living and dying. Adding to your troubles, the camera swings around wildly during the disengagement move, meaning you'll be a little disoriented and unsure of which direction to run. This can be particularly painful if you're facing lots of enemies at once.      The game's camera is pretty horrible all around actually. It seems sometimes to move of its own accord during combat and will occasionally leave you stuck staring at an empty area of the floor or the back of an opened door. Since much of the game takes place inside small rooms, it's no wonder that the camera's flexibility is extremely restricted. When combat is over, the camera angle switches yet again. If you're preparing to loot your fallen enemy, this is merely inconvenient; if you're trying to target a new opponent, it can be absolutely intolerable. There have been quite a few instances where an opponent has landed a few free attacks on me simply because I couldn't get the damn camera oriented correctly.  You can't talk about combat in The Matrix without mentioning ~bullet time.~ Your grandparents knew this phenomenon as ~slow motion~ but this term was thought to be much too descriptive and literal. Plus it has the word ~slow~ in it. No one has time for that crap. Reinventions or ~gnarlyfications~ of older terms is typically handled by such tricks as spelling things with a C instead of a K or using numbers in place of letters but since none of those techniques applied in the case of ~slow motion,~ an entirely new term was chosen, one that had a much higher RQ or ~rad quotient.~ Thus was ~bullet time~ brought into this world. Try ignoring something that has the word ~bullet~ in it. You can't!  But though it introduces an entirely new word to replace a word that means the same thing, ~bullet time~ is important to the Matrix brand. You'll find it used during the course of the game, never so often that it starts to seem ordinary or common. Unfortunately, the effect doesn't seem to include any of the cool camera pans that sell the effect on the big screen. Bullet time also usually only kicks in at the end of a fight, letting you savor only those moments where your enemies are already falling to the ground.  As I mentioned at the start, the visuals help sell the experience here. The whole visual style of the game has that gauzy, grimy look from the films. There's a luminous kind of aura around the characters that really sets them apart from the world. It makes a nice combination of the gritty, dreamlike nature of the world. The character models are a bit behind the standards for the genre but they still get the job done. Animations are fairly believable as well. The variety of outfits is sufficient to add a little individuality to the people you'll meet.   On the subject of outfits, I like that some of the clothes convey bonuses. While it smacks of magical armor, it makes sense in the coded world of the Matrix that an item of clothing could grant bonuses to certain abilities. I can forgive the fact that certain items can only be worn by certain genders but it still seems just a little stupid that enemies frequently drop clothing of the wrong gender. Perhaps Mega City is inhabited by a disproportionately high number of cross-dressers.  The city itself is rendered in amazing detail. Though there are a lot of repeated textures and designs, there's enough variety here that the city feels real. The cars and pedestrians that swarm the streets and sidewalks help you feel that the city is alive. There's not much interaction with them, of course, but they do serve as a nice backdrop.  Things are kind of sparse when you go inside buildings. You'll see desks and chairs and stuff inside the apartments and offices you visit but it seems like the residents of Mega City have a very limited budget for furniture and appointments. Many of the interiors seem to have the same layout as well, which kind of spoils the effect. When you are in the buildings though, you'll definitely appreciate the view when you look at the windows and see the world going on in the streets below you.  As far as performance goes, you're going to need a pretty solid system to get the most out of this game. Even with all the details set at medium, you're still going to get some impressive visuals. Even so, you're still bound to notice some framerate problems. You'll also notice some lag here and there, particularly in more crowded areas.  The sound is good, particularly during combat. Hearing the punches and kicks fly helps to support the interlocked animations. Weapon sounds are also handled well. I liked the voice work in the game but there's just not a whole lot of it. The music in the background helps to color the whole experience but it never really stands out on its own.Where The Matrix Online scores high is in the flexibility of the skill system and the overall adherence to the franchise. This undoubtedly feels like the Matrix, which is sure to please fans who've dreamed of taking up their own identity in the world and choosing sides in the three-sided conflict. The ~big~ story elements haven't really taken center stage yet with me but those that I have experienced have been pretty impressive. If the team can keep up that level of involvement, the story will be one of the game's biggest draws.But story and setting aside, The Matrix Online, isn't as innovative as it ought to have been. It relies heavily (unapologetically at times) on many of the genre's conventions, from class archetypes to loot to endless missions of errand running and extermination. In many ways it feels like a fantasy game in sci-fi clothing. For me, that just doesn't do justice to the potential inherent in the brand.While I really like the new interlock system, it still needs a lot of work. It's a real treat to actually see your character connect with enemies during a fight but the appallingly bad camera and the lack of freedom of movement definitely need to be addressed. Beyond that, we want to see more variety in the content. This endless running in and out of apartments and offices fits well with the setting but it gets old really fast.Simply put, The Matrix Online is only really enjoyable game for hardcore fans of the franchise. If you don't find the subject matter especially interesting, the mechanics certainly aren't going to win you over. The hardcore crowd will readily forgive these flaws for the sake of experiencing the world firsthand. Though the story rewards could potentially make it worth the effort, casual players aren't likely to stick around long enough to find out.", "date": "Apr 15, 2005"}
