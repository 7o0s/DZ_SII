When you think of a great snowmobiling game you think of Excitebike 64 on skis. You think of a vast boundless environment and high-flying stunt courses. Polaris SnoCross has managed to avoid all of these things, and at a very substantial price.   Features   First and only snomobiling racer on the N64 Licensed Polaris snomobiles.  Single player practice mode Tournament mode puts you in the middle of a cross-country competition Instant action mode lets you jump right into the action Uses MusyX audio tools for improved sound Unlock up to 12 different tracks   Change day or night settings  Choose weather conditions clear, snowy, etc... Save to your memory pak Rumble pak support   Gameplay From the beginning your options are limited -- no multiplayer, no stunt courses, no garage. You can play single event, instant action, or tournament. Single event mode lets you brush up on your skills, but only on the courses you've unlocked. So if you don't have the patience to unlock any of the tracks, you're going to be stuck playing the same three tracks over and over. Instant action mode takes all the tracks, conditions, and vehicles and throws them into a slot machine. It's quick, and pretty effective given the circumstances. However, we find it rather silly as it also randomly chooses your type of vehicle. This may shake things up a bit and add a surprise element, but what good is having different types of licensed vehicles that handle differently if you can't take your pick from them? Instant action may be a bit too instant. It's like having instant microwave food, but never knowing what you're having for dinner.   Tournament mode is the most substantial of the three modes, and basically all there really is to the game. The tournament is broken up into divisions -- sports class, semi-pro class, and pro class -- and the divisions are held during both the day and night. With three courses a piece, SnoCross offers nine different tracks with varying weather conditions that only consist of clear or snowy, and make no difference to the gameplay barring visual appeal. The tracks are all fairly unique with lots of twists, jumps, and shortcuts. In any given track there are at least four or five shortcuts. Unfortunately most of the shortcuts are relatively worthless as the AI tends to catch up with you if you so much as skid in the wrong direction. They're certainly not very fun either. There are a few death-defying leaps, but it just doesn't feel very exciting.  Controlling these snow beasts is like maneuvering around a coffin...and you're the corpse. Imagine racing down a snow-filled riverbed in your pine box. In your zombified state you lean up to drape your embalmed body over the edges of the coffin. This is about how easy it is to control your snowmobile. The physics are very clunky and dead. Your character animation even fits nicely into the role of a cadaver by flopping its lifeless body around according to the dodgy physics engine. Because of all this Polaris SnoCross offers very little to the snowmobiling enthusiast excluding the licensed vehicles. Vatical has delivered a very lackluster title to the public in hopes they will buy it because it is ~the first snowmobiling game on the N64~ and because it features Polaris brand vehicles. They are selling a license, not a quality product. The N64 is on its last leg, and this was apparently the company's last ditch effort to get the game out. It's far too little, far too late.    Graphics It is now the year 2001 and apparently Vatical has been spending the last three years developing a time machine. Fortunately for them they finished their time-altering contraption just in the nick of time for the wintry season. They sure must have been busy too, because they didn't realize that after a mere nine months of development Nintendo's 1080 Snowboarding came out in early 1998. By comparison 1080 makes SnoCross look like it was a launch title for the N64. Perhaps it was supposed to be, at least then it would have been unique.   Of course, we don't want to be overly cynical (although it's terribly fun). The developers did try to cope with the complicated N64 hardware. They mange to put four characters on the screen at once, with an okay framerate. Okay meaning it's nothing to stand in awe of. It will suffice, but we're not happy with it. Another ~feat~ is lighting. In night levels your headlights cast real-time light on the nearby landscape. Sure it doesn't make sense that all the player's headlights don't work, but it's better than nothing.   Sound Using Factor 5's tried and true MusyX tools you'd think there would be a lot of quality tunes on this track. Well the quality is there, but it's all loopy. That is, the music tracks are just 10-second looping samples. It all sounds okay at first, but then it gets terribly terribly redundant redundant redundant. The sound effects aren't much better. Running into a tree sounds equivalent to dropping a box of tissues on the ground. And there's this slushy black texture on the ground that sounds like you're taking the snowmobile through cold meat. We can't quite figure out what it's supposed to be. Perhaps just a different kind dirty snow. No matter how you look at it, though, the sound effects are pretty poor. There's no voice and the different Polaris vehicles don't sound unique from each other, let alone like an actual snowmobile. I have to ask myself over and over why companies insist on taking a license and using it to sell the game instead of the actual quality. Then I'm reminded that licenses are a good source of income for a lot of companies. To this day Titus is laughing it's way to the bank with Superman 64 sales, among others. Too bad for us, though, this wretched title found its way into the end of the N64 lineup. Polaris or not I was hoping the console might at least go out in style. SnoCross doesn't lend itself to that. Then Vatical has number of other titles that are supposed to come out, but judging from the quality of this one it's probably a waste of gamers' time. What a sour note to end on. If you're craving to rent an N64, go ahead, but know your money is probably best spent elsewhere. Don't buy this game, though. You can use half of what you'd pay for it to buy a shiny new sled and a hat. You'll get a far bigger thrill out of your 30-second plunges down the side of a steep hill.", "date": "Jan 26, 2001"}
