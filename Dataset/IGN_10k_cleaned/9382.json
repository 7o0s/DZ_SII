These games just look fun to play, even before you've put your thumb to the directional pad. Com2Us' Super Action Hero follows this trend, offering very approachable game play wrapped in a clever sense of style.   As a stick figure hero, players must run through ten different mission types in order to amass skills via a series of 32 masks. Masks are earned by meeting special requirements in each stage, such as collecting stars, breaking through walls, or defeating a set number of bad guys by jamming on the action button. The action itself is pretty simple, with different moves achieved by pressing the pad either up or down to release a punch or kick. As you land attacks, you fill an action gauge that gifts the hero with a devastating special attack. It's not difficult to get the hang of Super Action Hero at all.   The mask system is the most intriguing aspect of the game. Each mask varies your hero's abilities, such as increasing speed, defensive power, and overall health. Your hero can only wear one mask at a time. The rest are kept in a closet accessible between stages. The secret to getting all of the masks then is to make use of previously collected masks to increase a skill needed to defeat a stage, such as boosting attack power to flatten a bunch of incoming bad guys.   The whole package comes together nicely. I was reminded many time of Guppy Games' Stick Fighter Fury, which is a favorable comparison. The simple but smart art style and  the ease of play should attract action gamers looking for a simple way to speed a few minutes. Plus, online leaderboards also offer a way to compare scores, and that should please ultra-competitive gamers.  Super Action Hero is a fun, breezy little game that is great to check in on every once in a while. The art should pull gamers in and accessible game play should keep them tapping during bus rides and downtime between classes.", "date": "Oct 31, 2007"}
