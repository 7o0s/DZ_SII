And he's stuck on some scaffolding. With giant burgers. And in order to assemble the burgers, he has to run across the ingredients. Nah, there's no health inspector chasing him down for this. Fried eggs are. Yeah, and hot dog wieners. Angry wieners. But the chef can fight back. He's got pepper. Nintendo can blow that oversized ape outta their funholes -- this has boffo written all over it!~  And there's your pitch for Burgertime.  Features:  Recreation of arcade classic Hamburger assembling madness Pepper!  Hudson moved into the US wireless space last month with their incredible port of the venerable classic series Bomberman. Now, they're back with another blast from the past, the arcade classic Burgertime. And, again, the game maker is poised to score big -- and this short order cook simulator does indeed have ~boffo~ written all over it.  As we've discovered with this generation of cellphones, simple is often best. Games with clever hooks that ensnare you via game play, not whiz-bang visuals or daunting complexity. Burgertime is a perfect example of this appropriate mindset. As the chef, you simply must finish off orders by running over ingredients while avoiding nasty, jealous food. The LSD nightmare of a disgruntled McDonald's cook come to life.  The game plays remarkably like the old arcade cabinet, save from the constant desire for a joystick rather than a touchpad. As you dash about the board, you must keep an eye on the evil wieners that have it in for you. Shake your pepper at them with the ~5~ key to temporarily freeze them. While frozen, either dump a ingredient on them from above, or finish running across a patty while they're standing on it. Big points.  Naturally, the game doesn't look exactly like its arcade counterpart. The screen cannot possibly hope to match the vertical 19~ monitors of old. As a result, there are less scaffolding pieces to scramble across. Does this make the game easier? Of course it does. But that doesn't make it any less fun, as the fundamentals are still in place. And since there are several boards, the challenge of seeing how far you can get outweighs the initial ease of completing a screen.  The game does, though, have the soundtrack down, which was pleasant to hear. The jingle, familiar to old school gamers, is faithfully represented. It's a nice touch that previous classic remakes have bizarrely overlooked.  Funholes?I could lay that pointless clich ~You'll find yourself looking for the quarter slot!~ on you, but I know you're smarter than that. Burgertime is indeed a slick port of a favored classic, but some gamers will likely be disappointed that the screens are different, thusly negating patterns they have practiced for two decades.Actually, if you spent twenty years perfecting Burgertime strategies, you have bigger problems than complaining about a cellphone port.", "date": "Jan 14, 2004"}
