Actually expressing your opinion about the game is secondary - the real goal now is to be as clever and amusing as possible while you discuss the latest product of 3DO's flagship series.  If you've been following IGN's reviews of these games, you may have noticed that regular contributor Sam Bishop is definitely one of the industry stars when it comes to Army Men reviews.  Sam has moved on to greener pastures, however, and so the responsibility of passing judgment on Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 falls to me.  I, unfortunately, have bigger fish to fry, and so you will probably not laugh very much during this review.  Perhaps you will feel just a little bit of my depression, though.  Gameplay  Sarge's Heroes 2, to be fair, seems to have implemented a number of improvements that make it a better-controlling game than the original Sarge's Heroes.  The camera swings around responsively enough (it does the old vertiginous shimmy on occasion, but not too often), textures usually go transparent to stop you disappearing behind walls (although you'll still frequently get a screen full of low-res pixels when the camera chooses to do so), and things like the auto-aim and auto-circle-strafe functions allow you to knock off the tan bad guys with reasonable ease.  Too much ease sometimes, though.  Killing the enemies isn't much of a challenge, and killing bosses is a joke, requiring just a couple of flamethrower blasts or bazooka rockets - special weapons like that get ridiculously powerful at times.  On occasion, the boss enemies don't even seem to shoot back very effectively- the basic tan soldiers have much smarter average AI, although they also have their quirks, like deciding to get down and do the GI crawl off to your left when you're six feet away from them.  Cheap deaths can be paradoxically common, though, especially in areas designed to be negotiated through trial and error.  Whoops, a spider falls on my head and kills me there - better not go there again.  Dang, I go around that corner and a guy flamethrows me to death in three-quarters of a second - I'll remember that next time.  Another fun part is the edge of the first level, which you can fall off (no clearly delineated edge in parts, either, just a gradual fade into blackness until a point where you fall to your death).  The game's mission design provides the occasional diversion from basic running and shooting, like escort sub-missions and rescues, and you'll always have to find keys and open doors, but the vast majority of the action still boils down to killing everything that's tan and mobile.  This is 3D action-adventure at its most generic.  Graphics  The framerate works well enough most of the time, dropping badly only when you have five or six enemies to deal with, which I believe is also an improvement on the original Sarge's Heroes.  Visual quality had to be sacked good to get this game to run fast, though.  Sarge's Heroes 2 is ugly.  The textures are uninteresting, the architecture is unimpressive, and more than anything, whatever hand guided the aesthetic design of this game was wobbling wildly back and forth.  I'm still not sure how the Army Men world is put together.  There are Micro-Machines-esque real worlds that the Army Men wander about, dwarfed by the specimens of human civilization; then there are ordinary battlefields; then we're all of a sudden wandering around graveyards and haunted castles shooting zombies and giant spiders.  Why?  Did some 3D artist tell the designers to give him an excuse to model a giant spider?  Or was there just a giant spider model left over from something like Crusaders of Might and Magic that they decided to recycle in lieu of designing a new enemy?  I'd have to be drunk to ponder the question for very long, and I don't drink, so I'll cut off that meandering and get back to how Sarge's Heroes 2 looks.  Which, again, isn't that hot.  The explosion effects, as well as their cousins like gunfire and flamethrowers, slow the game down terribly, and they don't offer anything particularly new or original in the area of pyrotechnics.  And you wouldn't believe how long it took me to notice that many levels have no sky.  Seriously, toggle the first-person mode, look up, and there's just an expansive brown mass as far as the eye can see, into which the architecture fades after a little bit.  There's been an awful lot of cordite spent on these battlefields, it seems.  Presentation  Sarge's Heroes 2 has a story, naturally, but the world design is so haphazard, and the characters so dull, that I can hardly bring myself to care.  It doesn't help that the new characters include deadly Blue spy Brigitte Bleu, a badly-rendered CG woman with giant breasts.  Yes.  This is what is needed to enhance my enjoyment of a below-average game - badly-rendered CG women with giant breasts.  I love having my intelligence insulted.  There are a lot of FMV sequences in Sarge's Heroes, one in every intermission it seems, and far more of them star the badly-rendered CG woman with the giant breasts than I find even vaguely tasteful.  It's a bad situation when you're actually relieved by scenes with the chirpy Vikki, the mincing General Plastro, and the grab-bag of cliches that make up Sarge's crew, because it means Brigitte has gotten the hell off the screen.  Sound  For some reason, Sarge's Heroes includes a soundtrack that mixes generic hard rock with typical orchestral B-grade war movie themes.  I'd rather they just stick to the Hogan's Heroes tunes, given that they're a nice change from what you usually hear in games - goodness knows I hear enough generic hard rock most days.  The voice acting and effects are, respectively, par for the Saturday-morning cartoon and action videogame courses, which actually puts the game a cut above some other games in the voice department.  Sarge does declare himself ~good to go~ with a certain amount of elan. But it's still Army Men, and it's still not very good.  This is as generic a game as the made-in-Taiwan toy soldiers it stars, and it lags far behind the cutting edge in terms of design and technology.  Nintendo keeps turning out Mario games, but can you name a bad one off the top of your head?  Probably not, because they make sure they do something new with each one, they only apply that name to a quality game.  Well, I don't know if the world was really begging for Mario Party 3, but you probably understand what I mean.Meanwhile, 3DO keeps turning out Army Men games, and so far the jewel in the crown is Army Men Air Attack, which is good mainly because the Strike and Choplifter concepts it's knocking off are good.  Sarge's Heroes is knocking off some Platonic form of 3D action, which is a much more suspect model to pattern your game after.  This is game development as headed up by the marketing team, and that's not going to result in an A-grade game anytime soon.", "date": "Nov 22, 2000"}
