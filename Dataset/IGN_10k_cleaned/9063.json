{"name": "Penguin Fever", "name_review": "Penguin Fever Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/19/penguin-fever-review", "text": "The pitch meeting for Penguin Fever likely lasted two minutes.   ~Dominoes... but with cute little penguins.~   ~Do it.~   The wholly unnecessary back-story is about an Eskimo kid named Inuk that needs to bridge ice bridges to get back to his village. What matters is that Penguin fever is an incredibly cute, but short puzzler about tipping penguins that's fun to goof with for a few minutes at a time.   There are dozens of puzzle screens in Penguin Fever, each filled with wobbly little penguins that must be sorted and arranged. To complete a stage, you must tip every single penguin, culminating with the king penguin. You cannot leave any penguin untouched, so you must look over the entire screen and piece together in your hear just exactly how to set up each Rube Golberg-esque puzzle. Once you have arranged the penguins, step to the first bird in the bunch and give it a little tap. If you've properly posed the penguins, they'll all tip over like cows being assaulted by drunken frat boys.   There are several different types of penguins in play. As you progress through the game, you're introduced to each new penguin one at a time. The sumo penguin bounces smaller penguins off its bulbous belly. The fuzzy penguin rolls across the ice until something stops it. Tiny penguins split and go into two directions when tapped. Holes in the ice can be filled by frozen penguins... and so on and so forth.   Once you get the general mechanic of Penguin Fever down, the game is a gasser. I'd rip through six or seven puzzles in one sitting. The only downer is that there's only 48 puzzles, each contained to just the one screen. This game could be completed in just a couple hours if you're clever.   Penguin Fever is cute as all get-out. The little wobbly penguins stand there like those old-school blow-up punching bags with the weighted bottoms. The game uses some nice colors and the music is certainly catchy.I enjoyed Penguin Fever. French developer IP4U did a great job marrying a clever concept with the right theme -- penguins are still fun to look at -- to create a puzzler that's easy to recommend. It's too short, though, so get it on a subscription if possible.", "date": "Sep 19, 2007"}
