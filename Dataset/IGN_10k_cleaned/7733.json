Nine years later, he starred in Advent Children, helping the heroic Cloud combat and vanquish Sephiroth. After an uneven PlayStation 2 adventure, Valentine arrives in his own wireless title, adding a little more background to the character.   Tied directly to the recent PS2 title, Lost Episode chronicles Vincent's escapades that were left untold. The were apparently untold for a reason: Many are forgettable. Rather exploring an epic tale, players merely guide Vincent from point A to point B, gathering keycards and slaying monsters. It's nothing spectacular, but fans of the series might find another crack at the FF7 universe irresistible.    Game play breaks down into first- and third-person perspectives, but the controls seem a bit more suited to a proper console game rather than a mobile device. The d-pad is used to guide Vincent around the battlefield with a third person view and is limited to running to the front, back and to either side. Seeing as the camera doesn't immediately auto-center behind Vince, this creates some problems, as you'll find yourself blind to what should be in your field of vision. To alleviate this issue, when an enemy is nearby, a ring will surround Vincent, with a glowing section pointing you in the direction of the threat.    Once a baddie is within range, you'll be able to shift into a first person view, allowing you to target the various monsters throughout the game. An auto aim mechanism is in place, automatically snapping your reticle to the closest target on the battlefield, easing the process a bit, but if an enemy is behind you, the camera's rotation speed is really sluggish, opening you up for a slew of attacks, and quite a bit of frustration.    As Vincent is quite the gunslinger, he has a handful of firearms to keep him company throughout his adventure, providing the upside to the game. In his cache, Vincent has access to the Cerberus, his standard pistol, the Griffon, his machine gun, and the Hydra, his rifle. The Cerberus has an unlimited amount of ammunition and has a fairly fast rate of fire, making it the obvious choice for low-level monsters. When the situation heats up, requiring something with a bit more punch, you can easily call on your other two weapons by hitting either the 2 or 3 buttons, making short work of you enemy. The Griffon comes in handy when you're surrounded by a handful of enemies, mowing them down with the greatest of ease. When you want to take out monsters from a distance in one shot, you can pick them off with the Hydra. Though the controls in the third person portions are rather clunky, the first person bits work out rather well.    From time to time, you'll find that some obstacles will call for a little more firepower, and seeing as Vincent has more to him than meets the eye, he's more than capable for the challenge. When prompted, you'll be able to transform into a Galian beast, which is a giant werewolf of sorts, able to throw out some extra damage to the various environmental obstacles and other foes in your way. As it stands, Mr. Valentine's mobile adventure isn't exactly a milestone achievement - it's just okay. A 3D game such as this doesn't really seem fitting for the mobile platform and as such, some parts of it feel disjointed and unbalanced, making for something that has a lot of potential, but fails to meet the mark. It's not a horrible game; it provides a nice chunk of amusement, but it doesn't have any longevity or appeal to those who aren't followers of the series. If you've never heard of Vincent Valentine, you'd best keep looking - this one's for fans only.", "date": "Dec 4, 2006"}
