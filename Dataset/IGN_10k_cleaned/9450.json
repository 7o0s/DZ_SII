When another match three game shows up to the party, it's tempting to give it dirty looks and whisper insults behind its back. But there is a reason match three games continue to appear and remain popular: the system works. As these things go, Super Collapse 3 is just different enough to stand on its own and offers plenty of variety that should keep you puzzled for a while.   The idea here is to clear groups of colored blocks (at least three at a time) and prevent the ever-rising rows from reaching the top of the screen. The action unfolds on the touch screen while the upper deck displays your score and the remaining number of rows to be survived.  As you clean the screen, any blocks that were above a group will fall and create new patterns. Super Collapse 3 takes this simple formula and spreads it across several different game types and a lengthy Quest mode. The Quest will take you through ten areas of increasing difficulty such as Fledgling Fields and Aqualand.   ~Classic mode~ is the basic game, as described above. ~Relapse~ sends blocks from the top and bottom of the screen, and in an apparent critique on the notion of compromise you must prevent them from meeting in the middle. ~Strategy~ introduces a new row of blocks every time you clear a group. ~Slider~ constantly shifts rows from side to side so that groups are always changing. There are a few other modes you'll encounter as you make your way through the Quest game. Once they've been unlocked, you can play them anytime from the Quick Play menu. Unlocking game types is a nice incentive to work though the Quest game, and you'll find you are rewarded frequently.   Sort of a reversed Tetris, Super Collapse sends blocks from the bottom of the screen.   Items add another facet of gameplay to Super Collapse 3. During play, these power-ups will randomly appear to aid in your screen-clearing endeavors. There is a Super Bomb that can be used to explode surrounding blocks; a Row bomb that removes an entire row; an Hourglass that stops time for a brief period and prevents new rows from appearing. These and others can be bought at the Shop in Quest mode to be used as you see fit. As you win rounds, you'll be paid with cash to be spent at these mom-and-pop stores.   In higher levels, redundantly-titled Blocking Blocks will appear which cannot be cleared in the traditional manner. Only a Super Bomb can fell this foe.   A versus or cooperative multiplayer mode can be played with four game types provided you have multiple copies of Super Collapse 3. This is disappointing as there isn't a lot going on in this game and it should have been easy to make single-cart multiplay available.  Also, wi-fi support is not provided, although it is in the PSP counterpart.   The music in Collapse 3 is catchy when it's there, reminding me of early electronica like Kraftwerk or even budding Aphex Twin. But several screens in the game are eerily silent.  The overall game presentation is functional but not inspired and lacks personality.Super Collapse 3, if not terribly exciting, offers a solid puzzle experience. A longish Quest mode and lots to unlock offer an extended single-player experience. The multiplayer game is bare bones, though, and the lack of single-cart game sharing is really inexcusable. While Collapse is fun, it lacks the addictive qualities of some of the other match three games. But for $19.99, this is one puzzle fans might want to clear some room for.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
