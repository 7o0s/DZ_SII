The only goal is to exist without the digital community and have a little fun through collecting fun mementos, forging relationships, and watching life unfold ont he other side of the screens.   The pacing of the game makes it ideal for mobile, and EA Mobile's The Sims 2 Mobile is a solid to-go edition of the PC game that should serve as a great companion piece for most fans. I say ~most,~ because I suspect that the more limited nature of the mobile game could possibly turn off some fans spoiled by the ~world is my oyster~ design of the source material.   The Sims 2 Mobile comes in two editions: connected and standalone. The connected version is the more compelling product, as players are able to interact with the PC game they have logged dozens of hours on from their mobile phones. The Sim they have so much invested in can be downloaded to the handset, so you can in many ways pick up where you left off. Time spent on either platform is not closed off from each other, and that goes a long way toward creating a more definitive to-go Sims experience than, say, The Sims 2 for the Nintendo DS or Sony PSP. Those versions, like the standalone mobile game, are closed-off from the vibrant PC community.   The essence of the Sims is already well-documented. Once you create your Sim via a clever Create-a-Sim module. Everything from hair and clothes are decided upon before really engineering the ~soul~ of the avatar. Wants and Aspirations are assigned and personality traits are dictated through a series of exercises that include consulting astrological charts. Finally, the tangibles are assigned, such as cash (simoleans in The Sims 2 Mobile) and property.   Once your Sim has been successfully installed in the virtual town Splendington, you must begin interacting with other NPCs. Not everybody will dig you at first, so it takes time to learn how to approach and deal with these fake folk. Of course, half the fun is finding the people that do like you -- especially those of the opposite sex as your Sim. (Mobile make-out!)   While playing you need to keep track of your Sim's mood and condition, but if you log out of The Sims 2 Mobile for a while to attend to real-world issues, you aren't really that punished for your absence. I appreciated that. As much as I love Animal Crossing, that stuff gets stressful. Interacting with the other Sims and your surroundings is painless, thanks to a choice between either directing your Sims outright via the pad, or using a ~scan~ to select objects and people to interact with.   Now, this is where I have to confess my relative inexperience with the world of the Sims. I resisted the PC games mainly because I have enough distractions in my life and I saw people get sucked into like people get sucked into World of Warcraft now. I tried out the console games, but never really got into them either. However, this mobile game has the kind of limited scope I can appreciate. But again, people really into the Sims might find the small world too small on mobile.  The Sims 2 Mobile is a solid translation of the Sims experience to mobile, especially if you get the connection edition. I wonder how many newcomers will stick to the game month after month, though. It's just one of those type of games you enjoy or don't. And in the end, I just had a tough time getting into it. However, I can recognize that EA Mobile has a game with good scope and longevity here -- and it looks pretty good, too. (Nice animations.) It's one of those games I recommend hesitantly, because reaction is so varied, but The Sims 2 Mobile is a quality production nonetheless.", "date": "Dec 16, 2005"}
