We will at this juncture quietly pass over the minor, but unpleasant legacy of such games as Quad Power Racing. ATV Offroad Fury, in any event, descends from an entirely different pedigree -- it was created by Rainbow Studios, developers of Motocross Madness for the PC.  The apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree, which is a lucky thing for us, because like MCM Offroad Fury is in fact quite good. Someone has finally developed a strong physics model for a game like this that also happens to be fun to play, and they've put effort into the kind of track design that makes you learn how to ride properly, rather than just blazing through the courses in an arcade-spawned hammer-down frenzy. A thinking man's motocross game -- who would have thought?  Gameplay For a simulation of such a loud, brash, over-the-top sport (or at any rate, that's how Sony's deciding to market it in this context), Offroad Fury has a relaxed feel and a pretty subtly-designed control scheme. The standard motocross controls are there -- analog steering, basic acceleration and braking -- but they're joined by some extra arcade-ish touches, which are in turn balanced by a very detailed physics model. It reminds me of SSX in many ways. The control, physics, and some very thoughtful track design combine to create a surprisingly deep racing game.  ATV's tracks are rendered in considerable detail, both visually and as collision detection is concerned -- there's a lot of smooth, realistic nuance to how your vehicle interacts with the ground. This makes negotiating the bumps and turns a lot more interesting than it has been in PlayStation motocross games, because you have to pay a lot more attention to maintaining your speed, choosing a line, and picking the right rhythm through the jumps. The tracks are usually pretty wide, enough for three or four riders abreast most of the time, so you can pick a lot of different lines, and use positioning to your advantage some of the time. Swinging to the inside is good for cutting off leaders, but you can lose some speed if you turn too sharp, so there's a balance to be found in your cornering strategy.  The same goes for negotiating the rhythm sections, where the suspension preload control comes into play. There's a little meter to the left of your speedometer -- hold back on the analog stick while you head up a jump, and when it fills you can flick the stick forward as you take off and grab a varying amount of extra air. This sounds like a wonderful thing, and it is some of the time, until you study the lay of the more difficult tracks and realize that some of the time you don't actually want to jump that high. You can get an awful lot of air, thanks to the slightly floaty gravity physics -- when you're in the air, your tires are of necessity not contacting the ground, and thus not driving you forward. Jumping too far can throw off the rhythm of your progression through the jumps, too. Overshoot your target landing and you can wind up stuck between jumps with no speed, bouncing off the top of jumps with a nasty jolt, or thrown over the edge of a corner.  That's one of the new elements to ATV's track design that I quite like: there is no invisible wall at the side of the track. It's entirely possible to go right off the track, usually with unpleasant consequences -- you'll either bail, or be reset back to the point on the track where you left. That's no fun when it happens, but this is a nice touch of realism. It's no longer possible to steer with the walls, the way you could in EA Supercross (to a certain extent, anyway). The collision detection with background elements is often surprisingly precise, to amusing effect. On one track, it's possible to get a little too zealous with the suspension preload and catapult yourself right into the overhanging ~FINISH~ sign. In others, you can brush the branches of overhanging trees, knocking a couple of leaves loose.  Speaking of bails, and collision physics in general, ATV handles their visual and dynamic aspects in a manner that's refreshingly real, after so many inexplicable crashes and not-crashes in PlayStation motocross games.  If you bail in ATV, you generally know why, whether it's due to pulling back too far, nosing into a landing too fast, drifting over the high side, or just plain slamming to the other guys. Bumping up against opposing riders, meanwhile, has predictable, manageable, and occasionally advantageous results. The collision detection and suspension physics are detailed enough that you can shove the other racers around very deftly, pushing against one corner in order to spin them out or just berming them up with a solid whack. Aerial collisions are possible as well, although they aren't resolved quite so realistically. In a little homage of arcade-style design, Rainbow has borrowed the old rule from Joust: the guy on top wins. It feels a bit unfair when an AI rider comes out of nowhere to squash you, but that disappointment is balanced a little by the satisfaction of doing some squashing of your own.  It's possible to be justifiably aggravated by some of the other tricks this game's AI pulls out, though. At times, it's obvious that there's a bit of the yo-yo effect you sometimes encounter in Gran Turismo's arcade mode and the older Need for Speed games -- if you fall behind, they seem to let you catch up a bit too easily, and if you pull ahead, they'll be hot on your heels soon enough. It makes for a more involving race, but it still feels awfully cheap sometimes, when you're riding smoothly with a good solid lead and somebody cuts your line off anyway.     That's most often a factor in the off-road track races, which are wide enough for opponents to quickly pull ahead of you if they can. The supercross tracks are generally narrow enough that you can maintain a lead (they also lack the steep uphill and downhill sections that frequently see position shifts in the off-road races) and the open waypoint races generally let you beat the AI riders pretty badly thanks to the corners you can cut. The variety of race types is great for replay value, though, thanks to a good effort of track design all round. You have to adjust to different tracks even within each race category, which makes your choice of ATV and how you set it up (you can modify several different suspension, braking, and other settings) a significant factor in performance.  Graphics Like its physics and control, Offroad Fury's graphics are very subtly well-done. The detail isn't thrust right into your face, but if you sit back and play the game for a while, you start noticing the small touches that combine to create a good-looking game, and the framerate almost never wavers. The ground textures are smooth in almost every area, making it even more surprising when you bump up against some of the weaker ones (although they only appear in far-off corners of the free-roaming courses), and as I mentioned above, the courses are physically modeled in fine detail. There's not a lot of background architecture to admire, but what there is looks great, especially the brightly-colored trees covered in changing leaves.  The riders don't look exceptionally impressive standing still, mostly because you rarely see them up close (unless you choose one of the stranger of the game's many camera angles). They're smoothly textured, though, and you can make out lots of model detail in the ATVs, like individual suspension elements. How the riders and vehicles move, though, obviously received a lot of modeling effort from Rainbow. The crashes in ATV look very good -- there's always a smooth transition between the kind of impact you make and its unpleasant aftermath.  The riders are animated independently of their ATVs, so one will go bouncing end-over-end in one direction, while the other takes off and lands on his head someplace else, limbs and torso moving quite appropriately. It's almost a sort of partial compensation for the setback of crashing, at least if you enjoy a chance to appreciate well-done physics and animation design, and that same animation quality shows up more subtly when you study the mounted riders' body English. To top it all off, ATV's few obvious special effects kick up the realism level just a bit more.  Your wheels kick up nice cloudy trails of dust, accented by a lighter spray of bigger particles, and the lighting effects create some excellent shadows, which follow you around the track.  Sound The selection of licensed music tracks in this game is a bit puzzling to me. It's as if SCEA never left the second wave of the grunge phenomenon -- the standout tracks are songs like Alice in Chains' ~Them Bones,~ Soundgarden's ~Spoon Man,~ and Primus' ~Jerry Was A Race Car Driver.~ They're not actually bad choices, since the slower tempo fits the floaty adagio quality of the races themselves (and ~Spoon Man~ is a sentimental favorite of mine), but it's still awfully strange to hear the top 40 hits of four or five years ago coming from a brand-new game. The sound effects, at least, are unequivocally good, with a clear but not overpowering engine sound and some great ~OOF!~s coming from the riders when they bail, bump, or take a particularly hard landing.It's rare, around the IGN offices, to find anybody who's willing to say anything nice about a PS2 game.  They come by, take a look, gibber about jaggies and flicker and slowdown and things, and then go back to staring intently at Conker's Bad Fur Day.  Go figure.ATV Offroad Fury is one of the first games to break this trend (although Starfighter and Z.O.E. are turning some heads as well).  People looked at it, and played it, and unequivocally declared that they were going to pick it up at their earliest convenience.  It's graphically solid in almost every way -- the framerate is smooth, the textures and models are sharp, the animation never fails -- and the physics model works to create a game that's both deep and playable.  ATV came from an unknown quarter, and received very little hype, but it deserves all the success it can get.", "date": "Feb 6, 2001"}
