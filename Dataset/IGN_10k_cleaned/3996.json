{"name": "Knight Shift", "name_review": "Once Upon a Knight", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/09/once-upon-a-knight", "text": "In a field packed with RTS and continually energized with some high-quality RPGs, sometimes you have to take a risk in order to stand out. Once Upon a Knight (formerly known as KnightShift here in the States -- still known as such in Europe) goes the hybrid route, structuring it roughly like a real-time Heroes of Might and Magic, plus it's a fully-rotatable and zoomable 3D environment. There are two separate modes of play, actually, since Reality Pump added an RPG campaign, so describing the game's genre can get a little confusing. The game itself isn't confusing, though, but it looks like they would have been better served just sticking with the RTS campaign, as it's missing some elements we've grown used to in RTS Land.   RTS mode comes with a full-on storyline interspersed with video clips and voiced dialogue interludes. The plot is nothing eye-opening, though. An evil wizard is making a power grab and imprisoned the prince in some alternate plane, but a friendly wizard freed him and now the prince must gather his forces, find some arbitrary powerful talismans and defeat his foe. The prince will start out alone, carrying the usual cheap armor and weapons you begin with in the RPG genre. His stats are invisible and he has no inventory to speak of, but his skills, arsenal and armor will gradually improve until he and his fellow knights become pretty damned powerful. Along the way, you'll gather troops, sometimes a few at a time, sometimes by the dozens.   These units by comparison are incredibly weak. The infantry can do a fair amount of damage, but they can get cut down alarmingly quickly. The ranged units don't do much damage, and they won't back off to safe territory when the enemy breaks through the line, so they get cut down alarmingly fast, too. These units can also level up and pick up weapons and armor dropped by the enemy, but unless you have a finger hovering over the Pause key for micromanaging the battles, your followers will be continually cut down. You'll have several formations to choose from that prioritize the infantry protectively in front of the ranged units, but it's not very useful because infantry is set by default to bolt maniacally towards the enemy on sight, leaving ranged units wide open to flanking attacks.     Enemy units run off when they are low on health (unlike your units, natch), but your infantry won't run after them if another enemy is already attacking them. Your infantry will even pull away arbitrarily from attacking an enemy unit, and go after another if it's currently doing more damage. It's nearly impossible to tell your infantry to attack the enemy ranged units, because they won't stay there for long. Your units sometimes won't respond to a retreat order and will go running blindly into certain death when something has triggered their proximity awareness. You also cannot set patrols or waypoints. On the good side, there's only one resource to deal with--milk. You build a little hut that makes cows, and the cows will graze around for a bit until their milk meter is filled up, after which they return to the hut to get milked.   Sure, a little unpredictability might be a refreshing innovation, but it's obvious that this game was developed with fun in mind, not realism. The units have a subtle cartoonish look, the game is full of colorful, artistic particle effects. Trees sway in the breeze, there's a full night/day cycle (although no weather effects), but we noticed a ton of missing textures with the ATI Catalyst 3.8 drivers.   There's an undercurrent of humor that's unfortunately not quite as fleshed out as you would be led to believe--it almost entirely consists of goofy offhand comments the units make when you click on them or give them an order. There isn't much humor in the plot or dialogue, but at least the voice acting is competent, if not compelling.    This would likely have been a much stronger RTS if they hadn't put so much effort into including a separate RPG campaign and system. To make matters worse, the effort doesn't seem to have paid off, as the experience is fairly generic but still solid. This time you'll have full access to several upgradeable stats related to combat and such, and an inventory. However, there is no voice acting here, or an intro movie to give you a hint of what the whole thing is about. It seems to be a parallel to the RTS campaign, except now it's mission-based instead of combat-based.   And some of these missions are doozies. You need to rescue a guy, but only this one wizard knows where he is. But no one knows where this wizard lives. In order to find out where the wizard lives, you have to find this guy who will take you there on a boat. But you have to get a boat talisman in order to get to the boat. And you have to take this talisman to a special place and say a magic word to summon the guy with the boat who takes you to the wizard who knows where the guy is that you need to rescue. Oh, and the wizard hates visitors, lives in a heavily fortified compound, doesn't know you're coming and will probably do his best to kill you before you can get to him and explain what's going on.   You'll get this avalanche of information right at the beginning of one of the chapters, and it's a good thing you have a journal to go back to. Unfortunately, the journal isn't a list that details what you need to do. Instead, you have to replay the dialogue scene (after you've figured out which scene you need) and play it back, except you can't pause or rewind it. You'll have a mission list, but the extent of the info you'll get from that is ~Find the foozle,~ with a box next to it that will be checked when you've found that foozle. To the game's credit, you'll usually get your destinations marked on the map, but getting to those destinations often requires a pretty circuitous route.    If Once Upon a Knight had focused development on the RTS campaign and left the RPG on the drawing board, I'd bet we would have seen a much more compelling and feature-complete RTS experience. Unfortunately, Knight spread itself too thinly and we're left with two unsatisfying experiences.", "date": "Oct 9, 2003"}
