There are several choice favorites like: Guy: Did it hurt? Girl: Huh? Guy:When you fell from heaven.  Did it hurt?   Yeah, yeah, I know. But they get worse.  One of my personal favorites is a T-shirt I saw once at a party.  The clever catch phrase on the front was simple but effective, reading, ~There's a party in my pants and everyone's invited.~  I'm sure you've heard it before.....well, OK, maybe not.  But like it or not, you have now.  For some odd reason, I could help but think of this one while sitting down for my review sessions with South Park: Chef's Luv Shack.  Maybe it's the party theme.  Or perhaps it's the fact that this is one whopper of a multi-player game.  Or it could be the fact that much like the activity referenced in the above pick-up line, some games simply just aren't as fun if you're forced to play them by yourself.  Not that I would know, but anyways...Chef's Luv Shack is a great example of such a hardship in gameplay.  It is frequently hilarious, undoubtedly clever at times, and does a great job of abusing the South Park license, but there is one thing that simply cannot be ignored.  You can not, under any circumstances, play this game alone.  Forget it.  Why you ask?  Well, we'll get to that in a bit, but first, let me touch on the game's presentation.  As is the case with the show from which the game gets its inspiration, Chef's Luv Shack isn't exactly going to blow you away with it's level of detail, but the game looks like a high-res version of the cartoon, so at least you'll know what to expect.  The cool thing is, everyone is here, from Mr. Mackey to Scuzzlebutt and eventually, you'll encounter them all.  I say eventually for two reasons.  The first is that the game is designed to bring in as many elements of the show as possible, and it actually dos a pretty good job.  From trivia categories like ~Robert Smith Kicking Ass~ to mini-games like ~Chicken Lover,~ you will run into a reference or the actual characters from just about every episode you can think of.  The other reason is, of course, that like all games of this type, you will soon find that you've checked out everything there is to see. After a few extended games, questions and mini-games will have run their course, and this can get a bit discouraging, as you will want something more from the Shack than, as the game itself says, a ~quickie.~  And herein lies my primary problem with Chef and Co.  Unless you have a host of friends to go at it with, you will really get tired of this game in a hurry, primarily because it seems no one at Acclaim bothered to create a structure to support single-player gaming.  If you play by yourself, you end up doing just that.  No AI opponents come to the rescue to give you a good run, and because of this, you always know who's going to win.  I know this is a bit of a gimmick game, but come on guys, that kind of takes the excitement out of things.  The fact is, after games like Mario Party have set the trend of a computer controlled field for single player experiences, you'll want to be able to play a party-style game with multiple opponents, regardless of how many actual humans are at the helm.  Unfortunately for Luv Shack, you're gonna get let down.  Don't get me wrong though, the game is actually pretty fun, even if you have to play someone who has no clue what South Park is all about [Ed's Note: *cough*Anoop*cough*cough*].  Then things like the buzzer and mini-games actually have some meaning.  The trivia game is tense and hilarious all at once, and makes for an excellent change of pace form the likes of You Don't Know Jack.  The same goes for the min-games, which manage to rip off everything from Donkey Kong to Super Sprint, which are always fun.  But again, think long and hard about how boring this would be with no one else around.  Ugh.  To make matters worse, the game's ridiculous loading times give you plenty of time to sit around and think about how bored you are, as almost every single on screen-change requires a %$#$%#&^ spin of the old GD-Rom (whose definition took on a new meaning after a few rounds, if you know what I mean..). I always thought Chef's motto was ~simultaneous,~ but it seems no one bothered to explain to him the idea of streaming data from the disk. With a game this bland in the details department, it's not like this was even close to being a must. I mean, hell, Chef's speech would get cut off, for crying out loud.  Crystal Dynamics can take an entire game level full of effects and moving creatures of a PSX disk with hardly any issues, but I can't get a few still images and some speech.  Please.  All this is supposedly impossible, and all I get to see is a little CD spinning in the bottom of my screen.  Wheee. At least with Nintendo 64 version, I can avoid the evil audio cut-offs...sad.  The Dreamcast should have been able to stream that sort of stuff without any problems, but for some reason, the whole game seemed to remind me of the 101 freeway at rush hour.  What gives?  If you ask me, the entire game seemed a bit under-developed.  The more I looked at it, the more I though: ~Why isn't this here~ or ~Where is that...that would have been cool.~  Granted, I think that nearly every time I play a game, but things like the aforementioned evil load times, the lack of single player AI, no way to quit a game in the pause menu, no ability to join a game in progress, and no way to skip trivia and play a series of mini-games (selected or otherwise) just seems a bit stupid.  It's almost as if this thing was slapped together as quickly as possible without any thought to previously explored conventions of the genre, and because of that, it really suffers.  A shame really.  I love South Park, and the game has some seriously clever writers, but for all their hilarious mini-game ideas and irreverent questions, they over-looked a key fact: gameplay.  Sure, Chef's Luv Shack is a great short-term party game, but with so many shortcomings, don't expect much in the way of sweet lovin' after the honeymoon.  Unless you're a serious South Park fanatic, you might as well not bother.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 23, 1999"}
