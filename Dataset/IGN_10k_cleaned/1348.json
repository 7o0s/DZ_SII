One or more hostages usually get wiped out.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage ensues.  And the international media goes nuts, reaming military advisors out for tactical mishaps.  That's why when some homicidal third world splinter faction has seized any one of a veritable menagerie of noteworthy foreign ministers and government officials, the intelligent world leaders call in the Rainbow Six team.    In lieu of assigning out another private war or haphazard expansion pack, however, this time RedStorm HQ's sending the boys out to training camp in a reasonably priced standalone edition of the popular squad level action/strategy hybrid.  But before the elite group ever hits the seedy jungles of Bolivia, sub-zero climes of the Artic or the missile hidin' heart of America, their toughest challenge must be faced: Officer Candidate School.  Those looking for the ultimate database on covert maneuvers need look no further, because the included reference guide covers a dizzying array of subjects ranging from combat gear to key historical ops and hostage negotiation (mind you, we're talking about sanctioned methods, not the Stallone way here).    Mostly though, the encyclopedia is a gimmick, even if that bad boy's a well-produced piece of schwag.  Trainees can take a test to see how dedicated they were at hitting the books, but everything's just a setup to get players prepped for the new missions.  Although it's not necessary to sift through this mountain of nifty information it certainly doesn't hurt.  The more background knowledge one brings to the table during the gritty battle sequences, the better.  After all, fail the exams and your ego will be bruised, but fail in the field and your butt will be toast or prime fodder for Dear Johns at a Vietnamese prison camp.  Don't, for the love of God, buy this product for someone that's into casual titles and brief, uninvolved play sessions.  Despite the title's streamlined interface, which lets you slide from one would-be year long planning pow-wow to the next, there's a lot of variables involved in every mission.  Granted, the user-friendly bevy of hotkeys makes ordering allies around a snap, you've got hella troubles to worry about without having to watch out for underlings' safety.  Troops have to creep between waypoints undetected, oftentimes falling afoul of enemy guards and snipers before the bastards can be spotted.  Therefore there's a lot of saving and loading involved.  Yet whenever the game's high level of difficulty's got you down, remember - real soldiers don't have the luxury of a reset button.  In action, only three of the nine new scenarios included prove to be worthy adversaries.  The trio of non-training maps are large and enemies can be found by the dozen, generally in the places you'd least like them to be.  These are the last things RedStorm is doing with the Rogue Spear engine, and they've made sure to make these the biggest and most impressive levels yet. The Bolivian jungle level is just simply breathtaking with cool ropes bridges and trees and waterfalls galore. There's enough atmosphere here to fill ten games, and the same could be said of the other two larger levels.  As for the six other levels, they're ten minute diversions which a novice could zip through in moments.  But I digress, for other troubles plague the title as well.  Default HQ mission plans are seriously flawed many times for instance, leading soldiers into certain disaster.  Some textures are mysteriously sturdy, such as curtains which can't be shot through.  You can certainly imagine how unsatisfying it is to have to snipe at a leg sticking out from behind a drape instead of being able to pop a through what should be flimsy material and into the terrorist's vital organs.  Plus the audio/visuals, once a strong point for Tom Clancy's protege, have started to show their signs of age.  Candy floss consistency of the upgrade or no, this is a commendable acquisition for the household military head.  Viewed as a spin-off of, rather than as an addition to, the Rainbow Six series, Covert Ops Essentials easily does what it sets out to do - cater to hardcore fans with a little bit more of everything they've come to love from the product line.  But the devil's in the details as well.  Spastic players hoping for a full-fledged mission pack or campaign will find naught but a hefty handbook on field operations and a laughable smattering of new missions.  In the end the purchase comes down to one simple decision: are you looking for a full-fledged game or a Green Beret's idea of edutainment?    -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
