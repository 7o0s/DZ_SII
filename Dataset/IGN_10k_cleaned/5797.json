Maybe not something that will bring the love from folks of all sorts who come across the game, but Samurai Western certainly has the potential to be a solid niche title. It's name almost says it all. Throw a master swordsman up against a legion of cowboys and it could be greatness on a stick. But sadly we see a one-trick pony that provides a good ride for a little while, but gives out long before the final boss fight.   The main samurai here is Gojiro Kiryuu who comes to America to find his brother, Raddo. Raddo has given up his sword and now works for big baddy Goldberg, a big fellow who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dr. Robotnik. Gojiro's path to Goldberg takes place in and around one small western town and involves a whole lot of dodging and slashing along the way.   Gojiro has a mean block move where he can deflect bullets with a slice of the sword. When he's running and the guard button is pushed he'll do a little spin or a roll. It looks funny on its own, but when this is timed with an attack Gojiro can dodge bullets. This is absolutely vital since bullets fill the air in Samurai Western. There are plenty of enemies in the world since they can spawn pretty much anywhere. If you want someone to attack just do a 360 and, poof, there are some more people to kill. Getting the timing on these dodges is key and by doing it just right, Gojiro can get a counter-attack for some extra damage.    The problem is that while this technique is pretty fun to do for a couple hours or so, it just doesn't provide a whole lot more than that. This is a decent gimmick in search of a game and if there was more variety that would've been almost enough. But so many different locations get used two or three times in the 16 different missions that by the end of the game it feels like it's already repeated itself all the way through. Going through a saloon three times with slightly different enemies is a joke of an attempt to artificially lengthen the gameplay.   Aside from the levels which are just barely different backdrops for the same exact fighting, Samurai Western includes some stat-building and collecting to make the game more interesting, but many of the additions are just slightly different flavors of mediocre. There are different swords with different styles, but it's still about the dodge, slash, dodge, slash, etc. And since the exact same tactics work for the entire game, once the basic idea has been mastered it's just a matter of going through the motions with diminishing returns.   For those who want to really beat the game and complete it there are definitely some things to get for the hardcore collectors. Advanced players will learn how to perfectly time the dodges to get the high scores and collect all of the secret items, but it's hard to imagine anyone being really excited about finding more enjoyment in this title. The fun is good for a little while, but once it's over it's over and should be remembered as that and that alone.If anything, Samurai Western is a rental that is best enjoyed in a two-hour burst (four if you want to finish the game) before being put back down again. While those two hours can be some fine entertainment with some cheesy cutscenes, goofy dialogue, and funny sound effects along with the over-the-top action it's still much less than it needs to feel like a complete title. It's a shame because the idea, and that name, is so perfect.", "date": "Jun 8, 2005"}
