And until we're blessed with a first person shooter that lets us hunt and destroy Ricky Martin, THQ's WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is going to be the most powerful bit of pop culture on the N64 this holiday season. Developer Aki has refined the wrestling engine that was leftover from its pair of WCW/NWO licensed games, World Tour and Revenge and added a huge helping of WWF Attitude. The familiar grappling system is back and tweaked to included some of the key moves and  details of the most popular WWF superstars. THQ has picked up the WWF license from the previous owner, Acclaim, and this first effort combines the overall fun of the old Aki games and the exciting theatrics of the WWF into one engaging, electrifying package.  The Facts  Dozens of WWF superstars. All of the big name headliners like Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock are here along with mid-card jobbers like Brian Christopher and Meat.   Seven WWF event venues including Raw, Sunday Night Heat, Summer Slam and of course the game's namesake. Create-a-wrestler feature. Allows gamers unparalleled access to the game's engine. The competition between the wrestler editor functions of both Attitude and Wrestlemania will be tough. Stat tracking. Road to Wrestlemania career mode. Super enhanced wrestler entrances. This is already evident in the screen-shots we've provided. Asmik/Aki set the standard for videogame wrestling glitz with WCW Revenge. WWF Wrestlemania 2000 will no doubt expand upon what we've seen from the developer thus far. Full grappling system. Hidden weapons. Television-style instant replay feature. Realistic polygon models and real-life texture face-maps of athletes. Hugely improved crowd graphics. Combo move system. Rumble Pak compatibility. Four-player support. EEPROM save feature for created characters and careers.

The models still move and punch and run the same. The controls are nearly identical with the basic button commands for punching, grappling, running and Irish whipping remaining the same. The down side to this is that many of the same things that frustrated players in previous Aki wrestling games raise their ugly heads in Wrestlemania as well.   Your tag team partner still suffers sudden lapses of loyalty as he watches you get double teamed, computer controlled opponents have the uncanny ability to counter and block every move you throw at them as the game progresses and nine times out of 10, if someone runs in on your match, he or she is coming to beat up on you. These are all obstacles that can be overcome, however and even though we'd hoped there would be a little more sophisticated A.I. this time around, none of this detracts from the enjoyment of the game.  The good news is that the analog stick wiggling counter move to get out of holds has been addressed. THQ claims that every move in the game can be countered if you have the right timing with your block and evasion moves properly. This is true but only when your wrestler hasn't taken much damage. When he's worn down and barely moving, which is when you desperately need your counter attacks, don't count getting out of too many holds.   Wrestlemania shines when you get to experience some of the best trappings of WWF sports entertainment. We're talking about special moves and taunts specifically. Revenge wasn't bad at giving us the Diamond Cutter or the Hurricane DDT, but those moves can't stand up to the beauty of The People's Elbow or Mankind's Mr. Socko Attack. Mick Foley actually puts his hand down his pants in the game, pulls out a sock and puts it on his right hand where it remains for the rest of the match when you initiate the Mr. Socko Mandible Claw. Rocky Maiva actually kicks the fallen opponent's arm, rips off his elbow pad, waves his arms in an ass-smacking fashion, runs to the ropes twice and winds up the elbow before dropping the most electrifying move in sports entertainment. The moves aren't perfect but they are damn good.  This is what you want from a WWF game, THQ has delivered it and all is well.   The Road to Wrestlemania serves as the career mode for WM2K and it's very well done. You've got one year, from one April to the next, to work your way through the best the WWF has to offer. The goal is to end up as WWF champion by the end of Wrestlemania. It won't be easy because in order to get a title shot you've got to win some of the other belts in the federation like the Hardcore or European belts. To win these belts you've got to rack up some wins to make yourself a contender and seize the opportunity when those precious belts are on the line. Along the way, you'll get cut scenes of WWF stars starting feuds with you on Raw is War or before some other Pay Per View show, alliances between you and your partner may come unraveled and we even ended up in a cage match with Vince McMahon himself in our Road to Wrestlemania.   To unlock hidden wrestlers sometimes you'll have to face them in the ring. Other times, the hidden characters will make an appearance during your career mode and then they'll be selectable in the exhibition mode. We won't tell you who all is available to be unlocked but let's just say nearly everyone that's been on one of the WWF programs in the last six months is available in the game. No, Stevie Richards, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ben Stiller are not in the game.  The Create-A-Wrestler feature is actually a wonderful accomplishment. THQ has given us less of a wrestler editor and more of an open invitation to tinker around in the game's engine. As far as cosmetics, Wrestlemania doesn't allow you the same creativity to create the look you want for your wrestler as Acclaim's WWF Attitude.  You won't get all of the options for the varieties of orange eye shadow and you can't put text on your grappler's outfit but everything else, from moves to personality can be configured to whatever your warped little mind can come up with.   You can choose your guy's name, intro music, intro video footage, entrance attire, entrance partner, how they walk to the ring and even what they do when they get there. Your only limitation is that you have to choose those character options that appear elsewhere in the game. D Lo's neck snap is there but you can't make up your own variation of his trademark.   The variety of moves is amazing. Under the major headings of Technique, Grappling, Striking, Ground Grappling, and High Flying, there are subcategories such as running attack or turnbuckle moves. Every wrestling situation is covered in the create-a-wrestler feature. You on the top turnbuckle and your opponent standing outside of the ring, you dazed in the corner and you countering a running opponent and you standing on the apron with a dazed opponent inside the ring are just three of the scores of situations for which you'll have as few as three available or moves or as many as 124 moves available.   The main category you'll be concerned with is front grapple moves. It's here where you'll find all of the body slams, suplexes and powerbombs to use against your opponents. While you can load up on all of the power moves you want, you'd better be aware that most of them are easily reversed unless you've worn the other guy down. You're given the option to preview what each move looks like so you can determine if it's devastating enough for your arsenal. There are a lot of cool moves buried deep within Wrestlemania 2000 that are definitely worth uncovering. We've said that there are no leftover WCW moves in this WWF game, but we'd like to amend that by saying there are no moves with WCW names in this game. Spearhammer anyone?   Sound This is both a good and bad point of WM2K, but unfortunately there's more bad than good. The developers were very ambitious in trying to squeeze every bit of WWF audio from the TV shows into this game. The bad part is that you can tell, they had a tough time squeezing every bit of WWF audio into this game because some of the music for the intros is of low quality and very thin. The use of the Titantron for introductions is a major accomplishment and certainly worth it, but you'll be able to hear the difference in audio quality when the game switches from the menu background music to the authentic wrestler intros.  Aside from the music there isn't much else to here in this game. Announcers are sorely missed and they've been substituted out in favor of some irritating redundant guitar music. If the music from Revenge didn't bother then you should be okay with this. We suggest that you only keep the volume loud enough so that you can hear the crowd reactions and whatnot but low enough so that you won't go crazy from the background music.  The cage rattling sounds and the weapon bashing sounds are all pretty good, but the cut scenes are just begging for some voice acting.  Graphics Again this is a bit of a grey area. We know that the focus on Aki's wrestling engine is on the animation and the variety of moves that it can show off in its games. However, the blocky look to the characters, not to mention the game's bad habit of clipping can't be overlooked.  The heads of the wrestlers are three dimensional blocks that actually seem to be made up of six sides, each of which can be mapped with a face, hair, hat or other distinguishing characteristic. The problem is six individually painted sides of a wrestler's head don't always add up to one normal looking superstar. The face area of the head is so flat that the guys barely seem to have profiles.  The arms seem to be floating next to the torso and upper bodies of the wrestlers they belong to rather than being attached to a human body. The same goes for other polygons coming into contact with each other in WM2K. Picking up weapons, hopping over top ropes standing on turnbuckles and even grabbing an opponent seem more like approximations of those acts rather than an actual 3D character moving around an environment.  The upside is that the animations are fluid, fast and intricate enough for wrestling game fans. You can see The Rock do that little extra flinch before he kicks a downed opponent. You'll recognize the difference between a scoop slam and a one hand scoop slam. Moves like the Road Dogg's Shake Rattle and Roll are very well done and the accuracy of the move just does more to enhance the game's WWF depth. We've already told you about the People's Elbow and Mr. Socko, but the Stone Cold Stunner, Fame Asser and Lo Down are all excellent.This game has finally brought the WWF experience home the way I've always wanted. Since there's no game yet that can offer all of the drama of the sports entertainment, we might as well get one that gives us all of the fighting and violence that we love about the WWF. That's what we have here and there's more WWF Attitude in this game than in the Acclaim game of the same name. One thing that Aki has kept in mind is that sooner or later the intros and other WWF intricacies become obstacles to the game that gamers will just skip through so they can get to playing. It is then that the game has to sink or swim according to the strength of its gameplay. The People's Elbow alone carries a lot the burden of superior gameplay. Overall, Wrestlemania 2000 is deep enough and entertaining enough to head to the top of the class of this year's crop of wrestling titles.Are you a dedicated wrestling fan?
