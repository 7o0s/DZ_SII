The experience needs to be fun and light enough to appeal to the broadest possible age range, but cannot be executed in such a way as to be insulting  kids are usually a lot sharper than we give them credit for. Conversely, trying to educate or uplift is usually deemed ~preachy,~ and no kid wants that. The safest bet, it can be argued, is to tread where others have succeeded before: obtain a popular license and borrow from an established genre, such as go-kart racing. With this in mind, Konami and developer Universal Interactive are certainly playing it safe with Woody Woodpecker Racing.   Konami, one of the most prominent and enduring console game publishers since the mid 1980s, has produced titles of legendary status, such as Castlevania, Metal Gear, and Contra. You would expect a publisher with this kind of clout to reach out and snatch only the most contemporary, blistering-hot licensed properties. So what the hell is up with Woody Woodpecker? With so many popular kids choices on the WB, UPN, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, many of which must surely be available, it is a wonder how they arrived at this one. Despite such weak subject matter an otherwise capable development team might strive to innovate, but there is little in Woody Woodpecker Racing that is not derivative of other racing titles.   On the surface of Woody Woodpecker Racing there appears to be a fair depth of gameplay: nine different characters, three of which must be unlocked; 16 tracks, set in environments like the Loch Ness and Las Vegas; four vehicle types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses; and finally four game modes, including a quest mode complete with special challenges and ~bosses~. However, the distinctions between the characters and their vehicles are not all that apparent, the tracks are poorly laid out, and worst of all the difficulty is way too high  especially for a game obviously aimed at young children.    Woody Woodpecker Racing is best played with a game pad controller like the Microsoft Sidewinder, as a standard joystick is just too loose to be effective here. No mouse support is provided; but keyboard controls are available and both game pad buttons and keyboard commands may be easily remapped. Games are setup by selecting a mode and a character; in time trial and single race you also choose a track. Each race begins behind the wheel of your character; headshots of each racer are inset along the left hand side of the screen, a graphic speedometer is aligned to the lower right and an outline of the current track is positioned in the upper right corner.   When the flag goes up just hammer the accelerator and try to get to the finish line ahead of the other racers. Easier said then done. Along the way there are a variety of power-ups that will increase your speed, slow down the other racers, launch projectiles and provide invincibility. The latter is quite valuable, since each racer wields a weapon that can be swung left or right and cause a spinout  something the AI particularly excels at. Woody attacks with his beak, Chilly Willy a fish and Wally Walrus with a pipe wrench  why? Well, I guess that's just what walruses do?   Supposedly each character has a particular style of racing and will exhibit an aggressive tendency towards certain other racers. This is hard to see from the rear of the pack, where you spend most of each race. When you aren't getting smacked silly by the competition the tracks themselves conspire to make your track life miserable. Each are so haphazardly laid out that it is nearly impossible to maintain a high rate of speed without careening into a wall or barrier, which will stop your racer dead. There are ramps and other obstacles, so as to provide diversion in the courses, but most of the time these are just a distraction. What struck me most was that none of the tracks seem to have originated from or been inspired by the original Woody Woodpecker cartoons. Why get a license if you aren't going to get the most use out of it?   In addition to the standard go-karts there are stock cars, all-terrain vehicles and 70s muscle cars. Each track dictates a particular kind of vehicle; you may not choose otherwise. Each vehicle type handles and accelerates differently, but none are really balanced enough to keep you on the road consistently. Extensive use of the brake is mandatory in order to remain in race contention, as avoidance is the real key to winning; by contrast, most other racing games in this genre can be played with very little braking required. A ~bumper-pool~ collision system would have been more welcomed, where contact with walls, barriers and other racers weapons would have sent your vehicle careening in the opposite direction, perhaps decreasing speed a bit, but not bringing you to an outright halt. As a gameplay mechanic this is more frustrating than it is rewarding.  Woody Woodpecker Racing is a console port and that is never more apparent than by its graphics. The world and all objects are 3D and very colorful, but the polygon counts are low, giving everything a blocky appearance. The textures are large and sloppy, but at least there is very little seaming visible. Game speed is good with no observed slowdown, but the frantic nature of the game makes it hard to pick out one racer from another, so even if you harbor a particular hatred towards Buzz Buzzard it won't do you much good. Special effects, like projectile weapons and side attacks are kind of weak, however, your character's head leans to the side when you steer, and that's a nice touch.    If that godforsaken Woody Woodpecker laugh ever got on your nerves before, it will send you into an outright hysterics now  occurring as it does every few seconds. There are a few other sound effects, but not enough to imbue the game with much personality. The background music wasn't derived from the cartoons either, as you might expect, but is some kind of modern mix that makes about as much sense as a walrus with a pipe wrench.  In the end, uninspired and frustrating gameplay more than outweighs the variety of game modes, characters and vehicles. Ultimately, Woody Woodpecker is an off-target choice of character that doesn't do much to help offset the noted shortcomings. Scooby-Doo, the Flintstones or Ren & Stimpy would have made a much more interesting and compelling racing title. Not necessarily because they have better characters (which they do), but because the settings of their shows could have made for much more interesting racing experiences  and are probably a little more prominent with kids today anyway. Who wouldn't want to see Powdered Toastman whipping around the Nose Goblin track firing croutons out his armpits or see Shaggy behind the wheel of the Mystery Machine running down Scrappy-Doo? Of course, it's easy to be critical of a licensing decision, but if Woody Woodpecker was the best that Konami could come up with, maybe they shouldn't have bothered. But there I go getting ~preachy~ again.  -- David Kozlowski While Konami's PlayStation versions of Universal Interactive games have been universally disappointing, the Game Boy games have been an entirely different surprise. The Grinch was chosen as one of our Editor's Choice titles, and from our brief play of The Mummy, the game is an old-school but promising platformer. And now Woody Woodpecker Racing is the best surprise in any kart racer on the Game Boy Color. All developed by Konami's great Japanese production staff, the quality of these games bodes greatly for Konami and Universal's other upcoming games -- Jurassic Park III, The Thing, and the incredible PlayStation expatriate and Crash Bandicoot on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. We weren't sure what to expect from these games at first, especially since the Universal / Konami deal and titles came so fast and furious, but with trademark Konami quality shown in Woody Woodpecker Racing, there's no need to fear. Nice lap, Konami.  Keep up that pace and you'll smoke 'em out there.", "date": "Feb 13, 2001"}
