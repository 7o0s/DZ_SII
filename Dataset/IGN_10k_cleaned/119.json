The pack-in game looked great in screenshots, helping build a little buzz for the Turbo, but a few minutes of actual gameplay undid any good will generated by the brightly colored giant robot sprites. And that sent new Turbo owners scrambling for something else to slide into that HuCard port. Enter The Legendary Axe.   In 1989, Legendary Axe looked like a zillion bucks. The barbarian hero, Gogan, stood a few inches tall on your television, battling back screen-filling bosses across nicely detailed exotic environments. But unlike Keith Courage, Legendary Axe had some fun, axe-swinging action to back up those good looks. As you pushed through several fantasy-themed stages to rescue your girl Flare from the evil Jagu (one of those screen-sized boss monsters that NEC was smart enough to show in every gaming rag), you cleaved open frog men, roaring bears, and giant spiders.   As you explore nooks and crannies, you discover power-ups that make your axe, Sting, even more legendary. Each axe power-up increases the length of meter at the top of the screen. When you swing, the meter empties out and then slowly refills. So, the longer the power meter, the longer it takes to get the axe back to pure devastation mode. This adds the lone element of strategy in an otherwise single-track game. A flurry of blows is weaker than waiting for the meter to fill and then delivering one major strike.   Stephen Colbert would fear this game.  At its core, Legendary Axe was -- and remains -- a very simple side-scrolling action game. Lots of running left to right and hammering down the attack button to slash incoming monsters that followed predictable patterns. The flip into the 16-bit generation wasn't really about pioneering new genres, though. It was about taking existing formulas and blowing them out with better graphics and maybe adding a few new moves thanks to controllers getting an extra button or two. Thusly, Legendary Axe was an 8-bit game in a great prom dress. And you were happy to take her upstairs after the big dance.   There is something charming about a game so single-minded is an era where games sprawl or collapse under the weight of lofty ideas that aren't properly executed upon. That's why Legendary Axe, almost 20 years divorced, from now is still a joy to play. It knows its limitations, picks simple goals, and just sticks to them. In 1989, all I wanted out of Legendary Axe was a pretty-but-cool action game where I clobbered big enemies with an axe. And this delivered. And in 2008, it's a perfect palette-cleanser following Big Idea games like Mass Effect.   The Legendary Axe still looks great. The Turbo was not as powerful as the Genesis or the SNES, but it could sure push some colors. The sprite animation is smooth, the enemies fairly inventive (and nicely detailed), and the backdrops are painted up quite well. Legendary Axe also features an excellent soundtrack that any classic game tune nerd (like yours truly) would enjoy having on their iPod.  The Legendary Axe was one of the Turbo's first (and, sadly, few) gotta-have games. If you're building a Turbo collection now, it is still an absolute must for your library. You'll have a great time revisiting an action game without a billion button-combo super moves. Just run to the right and cleave everything with your axe. Purity is a healthy thing every once in a while. Not only is it simple fun, but it gives you great perspective at how the action genre -- and vids in general -- have truly evolved over the last few generations.", "date": "Apr 2, 2008"}
