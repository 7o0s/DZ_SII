{"name": "Darkstalkers", "name_review": "Dark Stalkers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/dark-stalkers", "text": "2D fighters tend to have fanatic supporters possessed with an almost religious fervor. Take the Mortal Kombat series for example. Kids will kick other kids' butts for dissing MK. Street Fighter has an equally devoted following. Surely Dark Stalkers can lay claim to part of the Street Fighter legions.  Dark Stalkers features the classic Capcom animated style of colorful, anime-derived characters, most notable for their horror-inspired characteristics. Of course, what sets this title apart from other 2D brawlers is its fantastic Street Fighter engine, truly cool special attacks, and vicious combos. There's even a special attack meter that enables you to pull off a super move after you've defeated your opponent.  Unfortunately, Dark Stalkers pales in comparison to the bigger 3D monsters that have been released for the Playstation, namely Tekken and Toshinden. But as far as 2D fighters go, Dark Stalkers is still one of the best.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
