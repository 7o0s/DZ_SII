This is for a few reasons. The first of which is I'm a nice guy that doesn't like to beat a dead horse. Unless it's an ugly horse that bit me. Then I'll beat the hell out of it. The second is that this game doesn't warrant anything more than a twitch and a short scream of disgust. The last is that I've already wasted enough of my time with this vastly under produced, unexciting, and unbelievably uninteresting title and don't believe in the whole ~this is disgusting, taste it~ sharing philosophy. Unfortunately, it's still my job to talk about it, so if you feel dirty after reading this, blame my management.    Coliseum allows players to put themselves in the shoes of a gladiatorial manager in the days of heroes, warriors, and a fictional world that's half Roman Empire and half fantasy medieval. When first laying eyes on the DVD case the game comes in, you'll be greeted by some terrible art showing half of a gladiator's head, in the style of the armor some Roman gladiators were wearing back in the day. Behind the head in the backdrop are some classical columns and on the back is a picture of what looks to be the Roman Coliseum. But when you actually enter a battle, a preposterously unexciting event, you'll be greeted with medieval castles and knights in shining armor and maybe even a visit from the king.   So what is Coliseum? Simply stated, it's a text based gladiatorial management game. But when you get deeper into the game you'll realize it's a boring and horrible gladiatorial management game. As you might expect, you play the part of a gladiatorial manager (you know, the ~team leader~ and ~inspirational guide~). At the beginning of a game, you'll have to pick a name and then roll for your stats. These stats are completely random and can be anywhere from brilliant to abysmal, with no real rhyme of reason covering ideas such as how well you motivate, train, and heal your fighters. As you might imagine, getting a stinky score in any of these areas should make the game much harder. What's worse is you can only roll for these stats three times, so if the computer gives you three horrible rolls, you'll have to start the game back up and begin again until you receive a set of stats that might actually allow you to play the game. You also might think that this would be able to see competing manager's stats and line-ups, but you don't. Hmm.   From here you can wander into the menu system that you'll be spending nearly all of your time in. This is where you can access your gladiators' stats, give them performance enhancing drugs, cast enchantments, hire new warriors, sell warriors, look up the next day's schedule and make bets, advertise for matches, and check out the league standings and news. Ooh, look, the news is telling us that a man with a scarred face, sunken eyes, and dark black hair is wanted for murder in a neighboring country. Everybody lock your doors, he might wander into our country and do absolutely nothing that makes a difference in the game in any way at all.   Each of the gladiators has a set of stats, such as strength, speed, agility, durability, and intangibles.  So depending on those stats and some hidden ones, such as the likelihood of injury or disease, your gladiators will either win or lose on the battlefield, with almost no help from you aside from the training and drugs, which have inconsistent effects at best and lousy ones at worst. Now you would imagine that a gladiator with good stats would probably tend to beat one with lesser stats. You would be wrong if you thought something as galling as that. Stats mean very little in the Coliseum. Gladiators will win based the program's whims. I didn't even know programs had whims.   Now most games with lousy gameplay mechanics such as this one will try to hide it underneath a veil of enthralling production values and seductive graphics that make love to your eyes and distract your brain from the pain. Not Coliseum. In fact, it seems to be trying to emphisize the gameplay with the complete lack of anything that could be considered presentation value. I'd like to call it ~unvalue~ but apparently that's not actually a word. What is there would have gotten me an F and deserved smack in the back of the head in any of my college design classes.    This brings us to the most exciting part of the experience, the beautiful text based battles that are as exciting as constipation. It seems like it would be pretty hard to make gladiator games this boring. Where's the intensity and stress of battle? You would figure, at the very least, that they would provide some sort of graphic representation of your fighters in the form of a portrait. Maybe one showing your armor if the developers had thought to include armor and weapons into the equation. Instead, we're treated to lines of text such as: ~Snarls of rage can be heard as the two fighters charge into the center of the arena in a frenzy of bloodlust.... Are you drooling with excitement or did you just fall asleep? Taking out what would be the only exciting part of the experience, watching the battle (or even participating in the battle) is one of the dumbest decisions possible in an arena like this. Who the hell wants a game with gladiators without actually seeing them fight?    But hey, at least there's some good sound in this one. ~Heyaaaaaa!~ Yeah, that's the stuff. You'll find plenty of grunts and growls like that. The occasional crowd cheering. Maybe even a ding and a clap.   ~And they think it's fair to charge money for this game?~ asks Fran Mirabella III after sitting unable to turn away from this train wreck of a game. Apparently they do Fran. I do not. Gamers will have to shell out 25 of their hard earned dollars to be bored silly. I could do just as well for only 15 dollars if anybody is interested.  It's hard to overstate the level of boredom that I now associate with the gladiatorial games. I had, before I realized what was involved in such an endeavor, been rather interested in either being a gladiator or if not that, then managing a team of gladiators. Okay, I lied about the last part. I had never actually considered being a manager of a team of gladiators. In any case, I'm considering hanging up my sword and shield forever thanks to Coliseum. Stay away from this one.", "date": "Feb 3, 2004"}
