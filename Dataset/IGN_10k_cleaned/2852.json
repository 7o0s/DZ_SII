NFL Blitz hit the arcades -- as the coin-op industry began its long, tortuous descent into failure -- but the game surged to the top of the charts, bringing pure arcade goodness to the dank, dark Golf Lands of the world. It was fun, light-hearted, heavy-handed football, created in the shadow of the old Atari trackball game, aptly named Football. The next year (1998) it hit the consoles, modified no doubt, but it still cut a giant swath into NFL GameDay's and Madden's profits and the way 989 Sports and EA approached their gridiron games for the following few years.    Now it's 2002. NFL Blitz has been around for five years, and well, the game hasn't really changed that much. Come to think of it, football games don't change that much anyway. The only thing is, this year's version of NFL Blitz makes the smallest noticeable changes of them all. These changes are more like tweaks, slight additions, and better looking graphics and animations.    Gameplay  If you bought NFL Blitz 20-02 early this year and you're looking to grab yourself a brand new, entirely revisited arcade football game of Blitz, well, you might want to give it a think first. This year's edition is indeed a brand new shiny revision, and it's good, but NFL Blitz 20-03 is basically a slightly upgraded version of the last edition. Yes, this is usually the case with any sports titles, but it's even hard to write about this year's version.    What you get in this year's version is the once omitted Create-A-Player mode, better animations, new additional animations, new plays, and all of the benefits from last year's version, such as the eighth man addition, big rosy touchdown celebrations, etc. Players get to choose the updated teams, including the Houston Texans, and some of the new plays, including a few new running plays help create a better breadth of plays. The game this year features Quickplay, Exhibition, Season, Tournament, Create-Player (similar to previous set-ups with given amount of points that can be distributed across a set of characteristics, such as speed, hands, strength, etc), a decent set of options, and Blitz Theater, which is a DVD extra mode with scenes of the voice acting being recorded with player such as Shannon Sharp, etc., and some other goofy enjoyable extras.   The controls are probably the steepest part of the learning curve, and that's not saying too much, since pretty much everything in Blitz requires the shallowest of learning curves. Once I figured out the control scheme (finding the rights plays, selecting the right plays, using the eighth man properly, etc.), I was able to use the eighth man in all sorts of excellent ways, blocking, going deep, handing off to, and generally pulling off the my once well-honed old-school skillz (sorry that slipped out, I just had to). I didnt use this new function in last year's version, and it's clear that on both offense and defense the functionality of the eighth man is key to avoiding charging defense tackles, full-on blitzes, and can be a key player in a sweep or any other kind of run. You don't have to use the eighth man or ~Impact Player~ feature to enjoy the game, but it provides another layer of control, which is definitely welcome. And you can use call audibles on both offense and defense, too.   As with all Blitz games, another key feature is that you can pass as many times as you want behind the line of scrimmage before hurling it downfield. Not only is this fun to play around with, it figures heavily into strategy. As with the original, NFL Blitz 20-03's control scheme is rudimentary. It has immediate pick-up-and-play value, but gets deeper as you play more: a sign of a good game. My complaint is that the control set-up is limited. You can change your controls to three-to four setting, but you cannot set the X button (A on GameCube and A on Xbox) to throw. That's bad. You can use pretty much all of the other face buttons to throw, but not that one. There must be a good reasonI hope there is a good reason, because that's the first thing I went to change, and when I found I couldn't, dissatisfaction set in. Yes, I got used to the scheme, and yes, all was good afterward, but it just seems wrong.   The playbooks have been expanded, and thankfully many of the old plays from the first and second years are there. I got so used to crushing nearly everyone with those plays that I was shocked when one year they were mixed up or deleted. So yes, plays like Da Bomb, Split Backs, Sweep, Cross, and later additions such as Monkey, Hurricane, and Cruisin' have remained in the book. Like always, every team has a standard stable of plays, broken into formations, which are further split into different pages. The formation/page scheme isn't very intuitive at first, and at first it's easy to get lost with the wrong play when the timer hits deadline, throwing you into chaos. Once you learn how to navigate it, you'll notice a ton of extra plays.    The running game has always been notoriously under-used in the strict sense of running plays, and the new run plays are better than decent additions to the setup. Usually, runs are created by setting up a sort of option or a passing play and then the player decides to simply run it if the opening is there. That strategy still works, but the run plays also work, including all of the sweeps. It still doesn't handle up the middle runs very well, but it's closer than before.    As with all of the Blitz games since the second version, players can play multi-player including playing with as many as three other humans. Two-on-two games are great fun, and for multiplayer party game fans, the four-player Blitz shouldn't be missed. The tournament mode is decent, but I agree with last year's assessment of the game: Blitz needs to add new gameplay modes, something interesting like a Fantasy mode, or a skills test for throwing or running, for extra points, etc. Also, I don't know what everyone else thinks, but the field goal kicking meter is so frickin' fast I have yet to score a proper field goal. NFL Blitz 20-03 is indeed ready for some new tricks, untried mini-games, and fresh ideas. It's still good stuff, but the game definitely needs to innovation.    The biggest differences between the three versions, gameplay wise, is that the GameCube and Xbox versions load faster and look better, the usual culprits of multi-console development. Of course, the PS2 version looks very solid and respectable, but the other two look better and load faster. The PS2 version still loads in about 20-30 seconds, whereas the others load in about 5 seconds.   Graphics  This year's model is essentially a super revision of the previous PS2 version. There are some noticeable differences, but they are few and subtle. There are new animations, from the touchdown celebrations to the tackles, are appealing, and considering this is Blitz, they're essential visuals, since you can tackle other players and hurt them after the play has ended. Players will notice that the tackle animation in which a defensive player throws an offensive player -- providing him with unnecessary, extra yardage -- has been fixed; we're thankful for the correction. All in all the animations are well done, funny, and over-the-top, like always.   The textures are clean, high-resolution and sharp looking. The high-resolution textures show off excellent loads of detail, and the facial textures are some of the best in any football game around. The players' arms show veins and the mesh on the jerseys look nearly real. The player musculature is exaggerated and the player models are varied well, too.    Lastly, the fields and stadiums look good. Players have the options to add rain or snow to their games, and they can choose from various times of the day, too. The fields are affected by these choices, and they look excellent when it happens. The grass looks like grass, the turf like turf, and the stadiums like, well stadiums. The arenas are fairly true to their real-life form. also. The only thing we noticed is a bit of slowdown here and there, but all of it very cursory.   Sound  With all new voice-overs, NFL Blitz 20-03 adds to the already large variety of hilarious one-liners, and the fun of it all is to get in there and listen to the trash talk. The music is solid stuff, too, as the development team has added new tunes to the now classic Blitz riffs. Like last year's effort, this year's version offers two-man commentary in which the announcers make fun of each other and rip on the players. The jokes are occasionally funny, and if you haven't heard these two jerks whale on each other, you should. There are some good laughs inside. They do repeat their lines, and they are occasionally simply off, but the new lines add a respectable amount of laughs.    Overall there is little to complain about. The sound overall is vastly solid and respectable. The audio options do not have any choices for Dolby or DTS Sound, so stereofiles may be left wanting. If you're after a football simulation, don't come near NFL Blitz 20-03. Midway's pure arcade game is goofy, off the wall, and one of the most addicting arcade games on the planet. But make sure to note it's not a sim -- and that's a good thing for gamers who are up for a good time, but not necessarily for football buffs or die-hard Cheese Heads, like our very own Chris Carle. Blitz 20-03 is indeed excellent single-player fun, however, and it's one of the best party and multi-player games on the PS2, including up to four players teaming up (in a two-on-two game). This year's version offers a slim set of new additions, including the Create-A-Player and better graphics and animations, but for the most part, there isn't much new offered here. So, unless you're addicted to Blitz, and you absolutely must have it each and every year, and you already have last year's version, you might want to rent first.", "date": "Aug 13, 2002"}
