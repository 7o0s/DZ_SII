And now Gameloft is trying to bring that thrill ride scene to your handset with their new coaster-sim/action game, Rail Rider.   Features:   Scaling 3-D animation  Shoot enemies while dodging obstacles  Boss battles   Rail Rider is a silly, arcade-style on-rails action game -- and makes no excuses about it. This is a great throwback to simpler times, reminding us of the old SEGA arcade game, Rail Chase.   You are a bounty hunter that recently came into possession of a secret map detailing the location of a horde of treasure. Catch is, you must ride to hell and back, literally. The priceless crystal treasure you seek is buried along a long rail line that dives rides high above a mountaintop before spiraling deep beneath the crust.   As the Rail Rider, you sit in your new CK2003 mine cart and try to avoid countless obstacles like wooden beams and fire bursts by leaning the cart to the sides, ducking down in the cart, or making it jump the track for a moment. All of this is controlled from the touchpad.   As if these hazards weren't enough, the mines are also full of miner-hating denizens, like scarab beetles, skulls, and huge boss battles that fill up half of the screen. You must use your twin Magnums to blast danger out of the way, 'cause this train don't stop for nothing.   Boss machine.   Rail Rider employs a faux-3D scaling technique to create the illusion of racing through miles of tunnels. You've seen it before in games like Out Run and Space Harrier. It worked then and it works now. The levels themselves look great, such as the Egyptian tombs and the final descent into hell.On-rails shooters were huge before 3D changed the video game landscape, and this throwback is a welcome return to some of yesteryear's good times. We tested Rail Rider on the Nokia 3650 and the scaling technique looks and works quite well on the handset. If you are looking for a technically-impressive, simple shooting/action game, Gameloft's Rail Rider certainly fits the bill and then some.", "date": "Apr 17, 2004"}
