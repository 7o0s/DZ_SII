Oh sure, there will never be a Rugrats that makes any of us forget Mario, but it just has to be imaginable that a creative, enjoyable game can be done with a Nick toon or show. But that dream is far, far away, and the road to it does not begin with Wild Thornberrys.     Features:  Six varied and wacky levels Three levels of difficulty, each with different endings Extra Link cable board game mode Password Saves Only for Game Boy Color    Based on the yucky but sometimes amusing cartoon series, Vicarious Visions didn't have much to aspire to with this one. Mattel asked them for a game based on this family of nitwits, and they did it. The end result is something like the show -- crusty graphics with some colorful pizzazz, a few weak laughs, and a little less than half an hour of entertainment.  Set up in a mini-game structure, Wild Thornberrys Rambler is already destined to be uneven. Roughly half of the levels are based on a fairly dreadful side-scrolling game -- it's one of those where even jumping isn't much fun. Two of these are bad action levels where you leap around in the trees collecting stuff, and are no fun at all. The third, however, starts to brighten the game some with an interesting mode where players have to sneak up on animals and videotape them. Unfortunately, the game is not smart enough to point you towards the final goal, so after all the shots are taken, you're on your own to finish the level in a maze of doors and platforms.   From there on, the games are better, but do little to win over anybody with more than a casual interest in The Wild Thornberrys. One stage has Nigel repelling down a mountain grabbing up items and avoiding animals, and another has the wildboy Donnie running around eating bugs. Neither is too compelling, but they're fast and goofy. Rounding out the package is a driving game (built on the Polaris SnoCross engine) in the jungle. Again, the level is just another scavenger hunt, but nobody can deny that driving a big paisley VW Van in the forest is a joy.  The problem is that there's too little thrill in any of this. Seeing as how the storyline is about the despicable Kip and Neil horning in on the Thornberrys' nature shoot, you'd think they might make an appearance in gameplay and try to stop the Thornberrys from finishing their job or steal their treasures. They don't, so instead, the challenge is in beating the clock. True, it is a kids game, and the structure of the multiple difficulty settings (with added endings for each) is a good implementation, but it's hard to get excited when only one Thornberry plays at a time, with no recognizable enemies, and not much to do. Except when you're eating bugs, there's little that even reminds that this is based on the show.  Uninspired and simplistic, but what else do you expect from a kids game like this? It's not exactly visually lush, but neither is the show it's based on. Still, this is yet another game that's frustrating to play for adults due to wonky control, occasional bad collision detection, and aimless level structure, so only kids with a long car ride ahead of them might have the patience for this. I suppose it could have been much, much worse -- the Link Play game is a simple dice-rolling board game, the kind you find on the back of cereal boxes with only one path to the goal and no frills thrown in for fun. Whoo-hoo, now that's wild!", "date": "Nov 17, 2000"}
