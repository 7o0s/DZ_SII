A peculiar action/RPG that focused on the concept of evolution, it wasn't met with too much excitement because, quite simply, the graphics were so primitive. Thinking it may not find a very big audience on the N64, Nintendo decided to bring it to GameCube instead. Earlier this year in February 2002, the title was released for GameCube in Japan, but Nintendo had no intention of bringing it stateside.   Just a half a year later, Atlus Software, being the proprietor of such appreciated import releases as Ogre Battle 64, announced it would deliver the title to the U.S. audience under the name Cubivore -- a fitting name for the box-eat-box game. Beyond the cover of this book, though, Atlus did a top-notch job on translation, which is a true feat given how completely unusual this rare creation is. For lovers of the strange and uncanny, and anyone looking to try something new, Cubivore is most certainly something you should check out. It's like nothing you've played before.   The Facts Begin as a child and evolve to become stronger Devour enemies to mutate into many different shapes Choose ~colormeat~ wisely to hone your abilities Face territorial boss figures for major evolutions Mate and be reborn as your offspring Progressive scan capable Dolby Surround Experienced lead designer Gento Matsumoto One-player only   Gameplay The Saru Brunei-developed Cubivore is a game of primal urges. It plunges players in a cutthroat, animal-eat-animal world. Darwin's theory of ~survival of the fittest~ would best describe the gameplay; kill or be killed. The quest to be ~King of the Cubivores~ begins as you awake from a deep sleep -- essentially you're being born. You don't know how, but the first instinct you have is to eat. The feasting begins as you learn to feed on small bugs, but soon after you will have your first taste of a meatier animal. When you successfully consume an animal for the first time, you begin to evolve and grow new limbs. The hierarchy determines that the more limbs you have, the more powerful you become. At no time can you defeat an opponent that has more than two limbs beyond you.   There's a story concept behind Cubivore, which has you returning color to the devastated and pale world around you, but it's not nearly as captivating as the drive to become a stronger beast. The story, instead, is a very simple vessel for the gameplay to expand upon, and that's exactly what it does. Cubivore's evolution system, dynamic and detailed in structure, and based on using square panels as limbs, is what makes the oddball title so enjoyable to play. Vaguely similar to Enix's E.V.O. (SNES), the choice of how and what creatures you consume in the world affects your hit points, defense, speed, and abilities. The first form you take on loosely resembles a pig, so your goal is to walk on all fours -- or in this case two panels -- and eventually be pig-like. When you reach that point in the evolutionary states, you will eventually be reborn as a bear, which in turn will be able to stand more upright with the right evolution. With a total of 90 mutations possible, plus boss figures and the like, you can eventually reach 100 and become ~King of the Cubivores.~      The whole process can be very dynamic. As you attempt to evolve there are many hurdles along the way. Every color creature -- yellow, red, blue, purple, and gray -- contains special ~colormeat,~ and has you evolve in different ways with different abilities. And, because you face off against boss characters, it becomes very important to choose your evolution wisely. On that topic, mating and defecating -- yes you hear right -- play largely into this. Depending on your number of mutations, you'll evolve better if you mate at the right time. And, on the subject of making ~doo~ this process is used to get rid of colormeat you don't want in your body, so you can keep your current form if you want. In addition to this, you can pick up power-up items littered across the world that will improve your defense and attack abilities. There are also a number of training grounds, which kind of feel like mini-games, that not only teach you how to do something but give you a chance to up your statistics.   Overall, Cubivore has an amazing amount of diversity packed in to it because you get to decide what you want to become. You have the opportunity to mate, face off against territorial bosses, and evolve as you see fit. Even better, it controls pretty well too. There's a lot of dexterity required for successfully maneuvering around these boxy beasts. When chomping into a piece of meat, for example, you can use the control stick to open and close your mouth, thus grabbing onto more meat. So, despite its simplistic visuals, there's a lot more to this very quirky title than you may expect.   However, as with so many third-person perspective games, the camera suffers. This is worsened by the fact that Cubivore was originally programmed to take advantage of the N64's C-buttons. So the camera moves around you as if it were sliding into notches. You use the C-stick on the GCN controller to push it in the direction you want, but it's not analog. When you're trying to fight an enemy, especially bosses, this presents a major problem.   What all this boils down to is that Cubivore is best suited for all the experimental gamers out there. If you enjoy bizarre and rare videogame creations, Cubivore is definitely worth experiencing. The translation has been handled fantastically so it's easily a better buy than going for the import version.   Graphics Not only is this a port from the N64, but the stylistic choice to create an acutely angled world has made Cubivore decidedly low-polygon and intentionally letterboxed, too! In fact, you could probably count the polygons in the world if you tried hard enough. Needless to say, the title runs at 60 frames per second and is probably one of the worst looking GameCube titles we've ever seen. The textures are really awful. Yet strangely, its wacky, artsy attitude is charming in a way; animals bleed purple rectangles and even water ripples are square.    On the plus side, Saru Brunei did take a little time to use some of GCN's power. The cube-shaped creatures have slightly rounded corners and you receive embossed panels as you defeat the bosses. They're actually very smooth, often shiny like metal, and the various signature designs are completely modeled. So, while it does look pretty bad, it relies heavily on the style. And, it supports progressive scan.   Sound The soundtrack is a mix of bright, classical piano, rhythm guitar, and even horns for the celebratory sequences. Some samples tend to repeat themselves often and you can grow tired of them, but fortunately they're not so aggressive that it becomes agitating. Creature sounds are also pretty straightforward, ranging from shrills to howls. It's all even featured in surround sound.   In sum, it's probably exactly what was planned for the N64, which fits alongside the equally outdated visuals. Cubivore is definitely one of the most bizarre creations I've ever played. I enjoyed it for that reason. However, it has some major camera issues, which frustrates at boss fights, but somehow the fact that it is so strange appeals to me. Also, the very core of the game -- controlling your evolution as a creature -- is nicely executed. I think everyone should at least give this one a rent, but if you are someone who seeks to widen your tastes in videogames, I would suggest a buy. It's got quite a few hours of gameplay to it to boot and how can you pass up the opportunity to demo a game for your friends that lets you defecate at will?", "date": "Nov 13, 2002"}
