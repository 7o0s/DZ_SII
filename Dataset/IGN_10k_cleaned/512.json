They were the best because they were the only team delivering the goods. Then, as if out of nowhere, came a slew of rival players, such as Fox Sports with its inaugural NBA Basketball 2000 and Microsoft's second  and most impressive  attempt at b-ball with its value-priced NBA Inside Drive 2000. After playing all PC entries until my fingers went numb, not to mention some of this year's remarkable console line-up, EA Sports' NBA Live series still stands head and shoulders above the rest for it's awesome graphics, wealth of options and most importantly, fun and depth of gameplay. Here's the dilly-o...  The first thing you'll notice after the lengthy (and extremely cool) intro movie is how many freakin' options are available to the gamer for a unique experience each time you load the game. Whether you're looking for a simulation or arcade experience, there's a number of game modes available: Practice, Exhibition, Season, Playoff, Franchise (my personal fav), 3-Point Shootout, and 1-on-1.  Not to mention that up to eight-players can team off via the Internet, LAN or direct modem-to-modem. However, as with past NBA Live games, two players at the same PC is preferred as there's nothing better than face-to-face trash talk and elbow jabs.   One thing that NBA Live 2000 offers is plenty of options.  There's four difficulty settings, the option to import your face by using a scanner or digital camera and map it onto a player's body (and toy around with features such as facial hair, goggles, afros, etc.), plus every current team in the NBA is represented in the game as well as famous players and all-star teams from the past five decades. How many other games let you play as  or against -- the likes of Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Julius Erving, Bill Russell or Magic? Even Michael Jordan came out of retirement to play in this game. One small beef though  where's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?. Wait  we're not done yet  more option include how the game is played (length of games, what rules to adhere to, etc.), how it looks (resolutions up to 1600 x1600, slow-mo dunks, Jumbotron) and how it's controlled (with customizable gamepad buttons to shoot, pass, pivot, fake, jump, and much more). Granted, some of these savvy offensive and defensive moves take some practice to pull off on a regular basis, but should prove intuitive in no time.   Even more so than in year's past, the computer A.I. is quite good, so don't expect to find too many loop holes where the same moves will guarantee some basket time against the PC. This is especially true for the All-Star or Superstar difficulty setting. Play one quarter on this skill level and you'll likely notice some sweaty palms by the time the cheerleaders (should) come out. Oh ya, isn't it time they have cheerleaders in these games?   Let's take a quick look at two of the coolest modes. With the franchise mode, which has been significantly improved over last year's introductory attempt, gamers can take control of their favorite teams for twenty-five consecutive seasons, complete with drafting, retirements, and so forth. Also, keep in mind fatigue plays a part now, so be sure to give bench time for those who need it. This is real basketball, folks. Writing plays and designing/editing teams and players is a godsend for PC gamers who want the creative freedom to truly make the game their own. If micro-management ain't for you, no worries.  There's always straight b-ball and, for the first time, a little one-one one on outdoor courts. That's right  pick your favorite player to go against Michael Jordan and indulge in some urban play during the day or at night. Even the boom box will play some funky tunes while you shoot hoops.  Graphically, NBA Live 2000 is unmatched on the PC for its sleek visual presentation, 3D accelerated graphics and speed, cool camera angles, and fairly realistic animation (though not as smooth as Microsoft's NBA Inside Drive 2000). Even more striking than in NBA Live '99, the real player's faces (and now body types) are modeled accordingly. Facial expressions are a nice added touch that reinforces the realism of the game. This attention to detail goes a long way, especially since it doesn't take a hit on the game's speedy frame rates.  All things considered, NBA Live 2000 is the quintessential basketball game for the PC.  For sports titles released annually, it's often difficult to justify to gamers why they should pick up the latest incarnation each year. Well, not this time around. NBA Live 2000 offers more bang for your buck than ever before.  It surpasses its newly-found competition in almost every category, from graphics to gameplay, control to customization. Of course, EA Sports cannot rest on its laurels as both the PC and console competition is heating up considerably, and will continue to do so well into the next year. But for now, EA Sports' b-ball masterpiece is the only one you need while dribbling into the next millennium.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Dec 9, 1999"}
