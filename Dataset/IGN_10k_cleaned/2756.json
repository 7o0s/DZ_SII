{"name": "Neverwinter Nights", "name_review": "Neverwinter Nights", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/21/neverwinter-nights", "text": "is undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated games of this year. After five years in development, the game is finally done, and to the delight of RPGers around the world, Bioware hasn't left us disappointed. If the shear size of this five-page review scares you, then you'll be happy to know that Neverwinter Nights is good, very good, even brilliant in some aspects. There hasn't been a night for the past week and a half that I haven't stayed up to well into the night (and early, early morn') beating orcs, minotaurs, and hobgoblins -- and I've enjoyed just about every second of it. But of course, like everything, Neverwinter Nights isn't perfect.   If you've read my first impressions, you'll notice that the single-player portion of the full review is pretty much the same. My thoughts on the single-player game haven't changed. As a matter of fact, it's only gotten better as I play more into it. What I will go into more detail here is the online aspects of the game and the Aurora Toolset, and of course we've finally attached that coveted score you all salivate over like the Hell Hounds you are.   The Rules of the Game  I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons computer games since the original Gold Box series, and tabletop D&D well before that, so I know my D&D. Only thing is, aside from playing Pool of Radiance: The Ruins of Myth Drannor, I haven't really kept up with the progression of D&D into the 3rd Edition rules. If you've been keeping up with Neverwinter Nights, you know it's set within the confines of the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition universe. Luckily, they're not difficult to pick-up, even for those of you who have never played D&D.  The 3rd Edition rules are actually much more open-ended than before, and your character isn't nearly as limited in his or her choices or abilities. With the exception of only a handful of class-specific skills, now any class can pretty much do anything. Wizards can wear armor, clerics can disarm traps, and rangers can identify magic items. It doesn't mean you're going to be as good at it as some of the other classes, but you can do it -- it will just cost a fighter more to learn to pick a lock than it would a rogue. And a wizard wearing armor will not only experience more spell failures, but he better have enough strength to heft 60 pounds of metal around.  This kind of system also make multi-classing much easier, and rewarding, than in AD&D. Instead of dividing experience equally among your classes, now you can opt to choose to train in any of the 11 classes whenever you earn enough experience points to gain a level. And if you do change classes, you don't loose any of the abilities you learned in your former class. So what happens if you start your career as a fighter and learn down the road that it would be beneficial to learn a few rogue skills? Simply choose rogue as your next class when you level up, distribute some points to pick locks and disarm traps, and go back to your fighter progression next level. I really like this system, and the 3rd Edition rules lend themselves well to a computer RPG.  An Orc Walks Into a Bar, He Says ~Ouch~  From looking at the screenshots, you may assume that Neverwinter Nights is an action RPG like Diablo II or Dungeon Siege. This isn't the case, as Neverwinter Nights is much more than an action-oriented dungeon crawl and still holds firm to the classic RPG tenets that you need to have a complex, epic plot and plenty of quests.   However, just because it's not an action-RPG, that doesn't mean the game drags. For a fairly rigid D&D-based RPG, there's really not much down time, and while it's not exactly a hack-fest, it certainly moves a lot faster than Baldur's Gate and its sequel. You will have to pause and rest to memorize spells and such, and there's a lot of in-game reading to do and conversations to have if you want to find out everything there is to know about Neverwinter, but combat it frequent and, although stat-based, plays out quickly. However, if you're the type who likes their RPGs slow and methodical, you can pause combat at any time with the spacebar and issue more strategic commands that way. Load points are frequent, but short, which keeps the action moving, and as long as you talk to people you run across in the game, you'll never be at a loss for something to do.  Along with the main quests, there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy, and even a few class-specific quests that you'll only stumble upon if you play the game multiple times with different characters. Some quests will even affect your alignment, pushing you further toward the side of ~good~ or ~evil.~ Save a merchant from a marauding orc? That's good. Save a merchant from a marauding orc then rob him at knifepoint? That's evil.       Although you have a journal that you can consult to see what quests you've completed and which ones you still have left, some of the quests could be clearer, with clearly defined objectives and goals. It does get confusing sometimes trying to figure out exactly what you have left to do in a particular mission, and a few have come down to me going back and talking to everyone involved in the quest until one of the parties involved eventually tells me it's complete. I've also run into one quest that I haven't been able to complete at all (I saved all of those animals dammit, but it won't register in my journal!), so clear, specific goals would help solve that problem.  The interface really lends itself to playing efficiently. Although you can opt to use hot keys, the entire game can be controlled with a mouse. The interface is basic and elegant at the same time, as you can get to a variety of different advanced functions in a matter of two or three clicks. Everything is well organized in a circular fashion around the person or object being affected, so all you have to do is right click and the appropriate options will be displayed for you to choose from. If you're not into digging three layers deep for some of your most-used commands, you can drag them up to the Quickbar menu, which can hold three rows of eight commands, or 24 in total. This is particularly useful for spell casters since you won't have to go digging through menus every time you want to cast a spell.  One of the biggest drawbacks to the single-player game is just that...you can only play as a single character. Unlike party-based RPGs like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, the single-player side of Neverwinter Nights only allows you direct control over one character -- the one you create at the beginning of the game. You can build a ~party~ of sorts, but it's not the standard six-person party that you're used to with D&D RPGs. In the single-player game you can summon creatures -- like the badger you see in a few shots -- and you can have familiar creatures, but you can only hire one other NPC at a time to go exploring with you. Although some people will appreciate not having to control six people in the heat of battle, to me Dungeons & Dragons has always been about adventuring parties, and only being able to have one other person in your party at once it rather lame.  To take control even further away from you, you never actually have direct control over your hired help (you can take direct control of your familiar, but at the expense of losing control of your main character). Instead you can only give them suggested actions like ~guard me~ or ~attack nearest~ or ~stand your ground.~ You can set the distance the NPC stays away from you and alter such things as when healers should revive you in combat and if an NPC should use melee or ranged weapons in combat, but that's about the extent of it. Your henchman is also always one level lower than your current level, so he/she doesn't really gain experience. You also can't modify your henchman's inventory...you can only give them potions and they drink them immediately. Yes, again, kinda lame.  The lack of true party gaming will send you back to the Inn or wherever you left your faithful friend on several occasions to pick up various characters that are suited to the task at hand. For example, you may want to take a cleric with you while wandering a crypt full of undead, while a rogue may come in handy for a particularly trap-heavy estate raid. Luckily travel is expedited, at least in the city of Neverwinter, as you can return to the Hall of Justice in the city core at any time to sell and change out your henchmen, and continue your travels where you left off for the cost of a few gold pieces, so going back for reinforcements is just a minor annoyance. I found that, unless you're a pure rogue or at least have a few levels of thief skills under your belt, you're going to have to go back and forth a lot to recruit a good rogue to open certain doors and disarm particularly nasty traps.   If you do happen to get caught in a trap or take a dagger to the neck, death is handled quite admirably. If your henchman dies, you just have to return using your Recall Stone and you can retrieve him or her. And if death should happen to befall your character, you can either be raised by a high-level cleric, revived on the spot at the loss of some experience or gold, or simply opt to load your last saved game.    She's Pretty, But is She Smart?  Henchman AI is another minor problem. Overall the AI is decent, but nothing super impressive. I've run into some pathing problems where my henchman will get stuck on a corner or doorway and you'll jump in the middle of a fight wondering where the hell the hired help is. Generally the spell-casters do pretty well, and react correctly to the type of monster. For example, a wizard henchman won't fling a fireball at a fire elemental and a cleric henchman knows when they're fighting undead and will use appropriate spells and weapons...that kind of thing.  Neverwinter Nights looks really amazing, with some of the best use of lighting and shadows I've ever seen in a game. The real-time shadows are really incredible, and it's little touches like this that are going to be making me wish that it was in every game. This is the stuff we all expect when we hear ~real-time~ shadows...they dance on the walls, wrap around solid objects, stretch as you get further away from a light source, and are cast from actual objects in the game, like individual slats in windows and the ribcage of a skeleton. Textures are crisp and clean as well, and look particularly nice and 3D with bump-mapping enabled video cards.  While the character models themselves are a little blocky, every item you find in the game will appear on your body if you're wearing or holding it, and this gives you a lot of variety in your appearance. The animations in the game are also very nicely done, with some class and move specific ones, like the monk's kick attack, really adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.  Because of the limited number of tile sets (ten if I counted correctly) and the fact that stone is mainly gray, indoor areas do tend to look a bit generic and repetitive, but it's nothing worse than you would expect from most RPGs. Indoor areas tend to be dark and hard, with sharp, defined lines. These dark, shadowy worlds sometimes make it difficult to see bag of treasure, and you'll be sure to miss a few unless you're zoomed in right on top of your character the whole time you're playing, but that's all a part of RPGs -- collect all the treasure you can, if you can find it. Fortunately you can just hit the Tab key and all the treasure and treasure-bearing vessels like chests, barrels, and boxes will be highlighted for you to plunder.  Performance holds up admirably as well. On a mid-level 800MHz machine, the game ran great at 1024x768 with the details pumped -- 64MB textures, 4X anti-aliasing, VSync...the works. Admittedly I did run into a few stutters here and there, but overall I was impressed with excellent performance of Neverwinter, especially when combined with the visual acuity of this title.  Seeing as how Neverwinter Nights is the first fully 3D Bioware RPG, you might expect some camera problems, but I've encountered only minor issues thus far, and I'm pretty impressed with the camerawork. It generally keeps your character in the center of the screen and doesn't get lost behind walls or stuck in doors, although I have gotten myself stuck in the environment once and had to use my Recall Stone to get out of my jam.  Zombie Can You Hear Me?  Bioware's normal attention to detail is apparent in the audio portion of the game as well. The use of positional sound is fantastic, and if you have a surround sound system, you'll be able to locate enemies on just their sound alone.  As in all the Bioware RPGs, the voice acting is superb in Neverwinter Nights. When the focus is on story, you better hire some good actors to do the voice-overs, and Bioware obviously knows the right people for the job. Although not all of the dialogue is complement by full voice accompaniment, much of the major discourse is, and the personality of the characters really comes out in the voice work.  Sound effects are really subtle and you hardly notice them, but when you do perk your ears up, you'll notice that everything is represented in the game. Characters grunt, swords clang, gold pieces rattle, and footsteps tap across cobblestone streets. The soundtrack is subtle as well and pleasant to listen to, but a bit repetitive. The dynamic music changes with the mood, marking events such as a heated, challenging battle, but I found a lot of times that the music would change just as I had killed a foul beastie rather than at the start of battle -- either I'm too fast or the up-tempo music is keyed to a victorious combat.  Tonight We're Going to Party Like it's $59.99  Although you're limited to one character and a henchman in the single-player part of the game, the good news is that you can form parties in the multiplayer side of the game. Neverwinter Nights was built with the intention of having a robust multiplayer component, and at this point, it looks like the RPG community is adopting the game with open arms. While the game was only released a few days ago, I've already seen upwards of 3,000 people playing Neverwinter Nights online at any given time, so it's not a problem to find a multiplayer game.  Servers are classified by different categories, such as Action, Role Play, Melee and so on, but even the role-playing servers I tried were filled with ~1337 d00ds~ talking about their video cards and homework assignments. This isn't really a problem with the game per se, but unless you specifically organize a play session with some friends, you may have a hard time finding a group you're happy with. Of course, with time comes familiarity, and it's just a matter of time before you find people online that you want to go adventuring with.      You can bring your characters in and out of the multiplayer game, so you won't have to start from scratch in higher-level modules. One foreseeable problem with the online portion of the game is that your character is saved to the local server, meaning that if the server operator decides he doesn't want to run a server anymore, your character could be gone for good. But this shouldn't be a problem on a stable, long-term server, which there should be plenty of soon, and you can always save your character out to your computer and transfer them to any of the numerous servers if this ever happens.   Even with all the people playing, right now there's not much to explore online in terms of game area. You can play the entire single-player game with a party, but with the exception of a few basic user-created dungeons and some player vs. player areas, there's nothing new to delve into yet. But this is totally understandable as it's going to take a while for user-created modules to be produced and for DMs to get comfortable with the tools to run full games. Like I said, there are upwards of 3,000 people playing online in the first week of release, so I have no doubt that we'll be seeing loads of fantastic user-created modules in the weeks and months to come.  Lack of original content is expected at this point, but the biggest problem with the online side of Neverwinter Nights is what plagues every online game: lag and latency. I've played on several servers online, and on every one I occasionally jumped around the map as the server attempted to correct the position of my character. LAN games run much smoother, with none of the lag problems I encountered online, but of course most people don't have access to a LAN that they can set up a game on. The recent release of the 1.18 patch only two days after release shows that they're dedicated to supporting Neverwinter Nights, and I hope that Bioware will find a way to work some of the lag and latency problems out of the code as multiplayer has a lot of potential, but right now it's not at the level I'd like to see it at.  And on the Eighth Day, He Built Neverwinter.  Okay, okay...with that header I'm not trying to imply Bioware = God, so please don't send me any emails telling me I'm going to burn in Hell. But I will say that God would have been able to get to that day of rest a hell of a lot faster if he would have had access to the Aurora Toolset. It would have been: ~On day one He created man, woman, creatures, grass, trees, light, firmaments in the midst of the waters, and all that jazz. And on days two through seven, He vegged out in front of the computer with a case of Mountain Dew and a pizza.~  The Aurora Toolset is simply amazing. Basically Bioware just dropped this powerful RPG engine builder in our laps and said, ~Now let's see what you can do with it.~ You can paint maps in a matter of minutes -- especially if you already have them drawn on graph paper. You can set up scripted events, write tomes, set traps, place treasure, and pick from a wide and varied bestiary to populate your modules with. It's really an amazingly powerful set of tools that Bioware has developed, and although it's not exactly easy to jump in a start your own module from scratch, it's a hell of a lot easier than writing your own computer RPG from scratch.  About the only thing that's difficult is the scripting language, which is basically C lite. You'll have to read up on it a bit and chances are you won't get NPCs to do exactly what you want them to on the first try, but it's not that hard to pick up. Luckily there are a number of pre-scripted events that you can choose from if you want to make objects and NPCs do simple things like walk from one point to another, but if you want advanced controls you're going to have to put a little time in it. Regardless, any dedicated DM is going to fall in love with the entire world builder and is going to be creating modules lickity-split, and you can even control your creations in real-time and run online RPG sessions if you wish.  Created modules are also very efficient and .zip well, making it easy and fast to transfer them. This is really where the game has a potential to shine the most, and we can't wait to play some of the user-created modules and some of the classic D&D modules like Slave Pits of the Undercity, The Keep on the Borderlands, and Hall of the Fire Giant King, which I'm sure someone is going to build. So there you have it. It's been a long time in the making, but Neverwinter Nights was certainly worth the wait. It's not the most creative or beautiful or revolutionary RPG I've ever played, but it's one of the most interesting in terms of the total package. Even with the initial online problems, Neverwinter Nights is a finely crafted, in-depth RPG with a lot of story and plenty of side quests to keep you busy for a long, long time, and it will surely satisfy those of you looking for your next fantasy fix. If you're an old-school computer RPG fan who favors party-based adventuring, you may be a little disappointed, but it shouldn't sway you from trying out Neverwinter Nights, especially if you're interested in building and running your own digital D&D campaigns. This game is just going to keep getting better and better as more user-created content pops up on the Web, and I for one expect to enjoy it the whole way through.", "date": "Jun 21, 2002"}
