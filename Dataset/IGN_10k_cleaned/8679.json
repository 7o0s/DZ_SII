At this point, it might be a good idea to cling to those warm memories rather than continuing on to play this latest Xbox Live Arcade title. While Band of Bugs is a competent strategy game, it falls short in too many important areas for it to hold your attention for very long.    Band of Bugs follows most of the conventional design decisions other turn based strategy games have laid out in the past. The battle begins on a small grid and each team takes turns moving a single unit and then performing an action. Different units have their own attack powers, defense, special abilities, and range of movement, which is where the strategy element comes in. Success requires thinking a few steps in advance as you jockey for position and attack weak points in the line. There's a bit of environmental interaction with water or map edges to push enemies into (it kills them instantly), ice that can be melted to make a temporary water pit, and a few items that can be picked up. And, as usual, angle and direction of attack will alter the damage done accordingly. The standard unit types are here including archers, healers, magicians, and melee combatants. The twist is, they're bugs.     Bugs aren't much of a twist per se, but they do provide the basis for most of the entertainment this game delivers. The brief 20-mission campaign takes you through the story of Maal and company as they defend the lands against marauding bugs and investigate the mystery of the dark jelly. The story isn't the greatest, but the healthy dose of humor injected throughout provides just enough smiles to get you past the middling gameplay.    What's lacking in the gameplay comes primarily from a distinct absence of any feeling of ownership over the party you're commanding. Each mission gives you a predetermined party of bugs to fight with, removing a lot of the fun that the RPG elements present in most turn-based strategy games incorporate. Selecting a specific set of units for your party, outfitting them according to your strategic needs, and deploying a squad that you've hand crafted is entirely absent. This happens in both the campaign and multiplayer modes and the result is an experience that just doesn't feel very compelling. Oh look, here comes another online battle that pits my four generic bugs against the exact same four generic bugs.     Band of Bugs tosses in more features than the average XBLA game which helps a little towards making up for the uninspired gameplay. Vision camera support, four different multiplayer modes, and a level editor that enables you to share your creations with others online are all included. There's even a ~mystery~ leaderboard that ranks players using hidden criteria. We think. The game definitely has leaderboards, but our Xbox 360 crashes anytime we try to access them. Apparently this stems from a bug with having too many friends on your Xbox Live gamertag. A patch is likely forthcoming, but as of this writing we haven't been able to access this feature.   The level editor is a first for Xbox Live Arcade in that you can actually create your own scenario and test it out against others online. This is probably the most compelling reason to continue investing time in Band of Bugs as the user-created maps will likely provide quite a bit more variety and pizzazz than what is currently available. The level editor is easy to use and provides enough options to allow for a broad spectrum of maps. In the end though, it is hampered by the same drawback to the developer-created maps - you have to predefine which units will exist on the playing field as part of the creation process. This makes the whole process a little less flexible than one would hope for.   As an 800 Microsoft Point game ($10 USD), Band of Bugs delivers in terms of graphics and features to make the price appear reasonable. Although the cartoony and child friendly graphics aren't likely to entice the hardcore audience that strategy games usually find, they work quite well within the context of the light-hearted story and incessant humor. The sound, too, fits the bill. If you just stop to look and listen, you can almost fool yourself into thinking that the game is great.Band of Bugs is a success in just about every category, except the most important one. The feature set, most notably the level editor, visuals, sounds, and wit all work and work well. Unfortunately for fans of turn-based strategy games, the gameplay won't hold up to the standards we're all used to. Download it if you must, but know there are better alternatives out there.", "date": "Jun 22, 2007"}
