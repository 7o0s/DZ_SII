It's a fun, easy way to keep gameplay lively and pander to the short attention spans of the ADHD generation. Unfortunately, some people haven't quite figured out how to make a decent minigame. Enter Collision Studios. Their new game, Camp Lazlo: Leaky Lake Games takes all the humor and fun of the hit Cartoon Network show, and puts it somewhere else, because it's nowhere to be found in this terrible title.    It's time for the Leaky Lake games, and this yeah, Camp Kidney is determined to win! An in-camp competition is being held to determine which cabin will represent Camp Kidney in the games. The scouts in the Jelly cabin -- Lazlo, Raj, and Clam -- are determined to bring home the trophy. By earning badges in various events, the Jelly cabin can earn the privilege of representing the camp.    There are quite a number of events to compete in, and the three main characters switch off at each event. The minigames make up a good quantity of the game, and most of them are unique. The games vary from leaping across furniture, to high dive contests, to sitting on giant piles of pinecones. None of them are complicated, or very hard, which is good for minigames. Quite a few of them however take far too long to play to really be much fun. Many of the minigames take upwards of five minutes to play; that's not very mini. Each minigame is preceded by a diagram of the GBA, explaining which buttons do what. Unfortunately, the diagram doesn't explain what the objective of the game is, or any other useful information. The first few seconds of each minigame is spent trying to figure out how to play it. Some of the minigames have rules that are never stated. For instance, in the food fight game, players lose if Clam gets hit three times, and he has to survive until the end of the time. Players are never told that. Instead the game only informs players how to throw food at other campers (which is not the point of the game at all). For some reason it keep track of your score for the game, but there's no point to it. A lot of the games tend to have these weird useless scores that serve no useful purpose.    Players can check the scoreboard in the camp to see their best scores for all the minigames, and play them again. However, I had a hard time finding a single game that was worth playing again, and since there is no apparent reward for getting a better time, all motivation to do so was completely lost.    In between the events are fetch quests that players have to complete. This is where most of the other characters work into the game. The other campers will ask for sleeping bags, flamingos, oars, flags, or whatever else they need. The fetch quests just delay the minigames, and get boring pretty quickly. It's nice to get to interact with nearly every character from the show, including ones that get very little screen time on the show itself, but there had to have been a better way to do it. Maneuvering around the camp is a clumsy experience, and trying to work through paths between the trees quickly becomes a chore. Characters bump into objects and get stuck due to the poor collision detection and awkward level layout. Even the simple act of walking through a door takes multiple tries sometimes.       Whenever players have to go somewhere or find something, the compass will point them in the right direction. The developers had the compass spin like crazy before pointing in the correct direction. It can get silly sometimes when players have to go talk to a character that is only four steps to the right, but the compass does its crazy spinning thing, making the player wait for it to reveal exactly how to get there!    The Camp Lazlo cartoon has an interesting animation style, and the guys at Collision do a pretty good job of capturing the feel of the show. The character sprites look a little odd at times, or from certain angles. The animation is decent, though it's nothing spectacular. There just isn't a lot of action going on in the game to animate. While the levels do carry the charm of Camp Kidney, most of the places look the same. There isn't much diversity within it, so it feels tedious to walk through the camp during the fetch quests.    To make otherwise boring game worse, Camp Lazlo has some of the most horrendous music ever heard on the GBA. At best the songs are repetitive and boring, and at worst it feels like the game is trying to rape ears. Turning the sound down on this game is not just a good idea, it is a necessity. Generally I only advise fans of the license in question to consider picking up these types of games, but in this case, I can't even do that. While fans of the show may be pleased that nearly every character makes at least some appearance, and that the dialogue actually mentions specific episodes, they will soon be turned away by the boring, and sometimes clunky, gameplay.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
