While usually simpler in design than their PC cousins, strategy games such as Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Tactics Ogre and Advance Wars rival even the best computer strategy titles.   If you're an old-school PC strategy gamer, you're probably familiar with X-Com: UFO Defense, and if you've ever played X-Com, you have a good idea how Rebelstar Tactical Command plays. Now don't get too excited that it's going to bring back all those fond memories of X-Com, though. There is no research tree, no base building, no alien dissections and no global map. What is here, however, is the turn-based squad combat section of the original game.   The campaign mode starts out with you in control of just one squad member: Jorel, but within a few hours you'll be in command of a half-dozen troopers or more. Each of your squad mates in Rebelstar Tactical Command has a pool of points to draw from each round to perform actions such as moving on the grid map, shooting, throwing grenades, picking up items, and the like. While it may take a while for newcomers to get into the game because of the vast number of options, if you've ever played a turn-based strategy game, you'll probably be able to jump right into Rebelstar.     The tactics are simple, yet intricate, and require a good deal of foresight and planning. While you may be able to take out two aliens in one round, it may be a better idea to only take out one and save your action points to dive behind some stacked sandbags or a wall to take cover. The strategy of the game lies in using your action points to the fullest while still remaining in cover and not getting shot yourself. It's kind of like a puzzle game as you see just how far you can push the limit while still staying safe yourself, and covering your other teammates in the process.  CODO games has done a good job at using the limited GBA controls to their fullest for a strategy game, and although there are a number of tactical options you can make during each move, the menus are easy to navigate and use. One minor annoyance I found with the controls in Rebelstar is when you select to move a character after you have shot a distant enemy, the cursor should automatically snap back to the character instead of making you scroll all the way back to the selected squad member manually.  In addition to the strategy elements, Rebelstar also throws a few RPG standards into the mix. You gain experience through killing opponents or healing your teammates. When you gain a level you gain four attribute points which are distributed at random. However, you can manually assign one point to one of the many skills in the game, such as heavy weapons, stealth, close combat and rifle.   There is a heal exploit that unbalances the game a bit. In addition to those injured from enemy fire, you gain experience for healing teammates that you wound, so you can shoot your own squad members and patch them up, gathering a bit of xp in the process. Although it's a slow method and you only gain a small amount of experience, it's still a cheap way to gain a few levels early on.      While you can create a well-rounded crew with some members who are effective at long range and others who are deadly at short range, I found the best squad to assemble is a light Black Ops group in which everyone can move fast, has a high stealth skill (helps you remain unseen and dodge enemy shots) and are armed with pistol-type weapons. This type of crew can flow through the levels fairly quickly, sneaking up behind enemies at close range, throwing grenades at long distances, and hiding behind corners or trees at the end of each round.   The visuals in the game are bright and colorful, but look rather simple, even for a GBA game. Animation is choppy, and none of the effects in the game, such as exploding grenades and flaming debris, are overly impressive. The animation and sound cues for when you are hit or when you hit an enemy could be more telling as well, as you often don't see if you've been hit when an enemy fires as the camera focuses on where the shot originated, not where it landed. Rebelstar's high-pitched soundtrack is repetitive and annoying, but luckily it can be turned off in the options menu.    The campaign mode in Rebelstar Tactical Command should offer up about 20 hours of gameplay to the average gamer. However, some of the length of the game is due to frequent reloads of save games as some early missions require you to keep all of your team alive, but after about the mid-point of the story mode you only have to keep one trooper alive by the end of the mission. I guess the logic is he or she can pull all the other bodies out of the fray and fix them up at the base so they're fully healed for the next battle. You can also reload in the middle of a mission, but you have to be careful as there's only one save spot in mid-battle, so you can screw yourself over if you back yourself into a corner that you can't get out of.  To extend gameplay a bit, in addition to the campaign mode there's a skirmish mode where you can set up an instant battle and play as any one of the game's four races. However, the skirmish maps aren't generated randomly, and are instead maps directly out of the campaign mode. There is also a two-player head-to-head skirmish mode, but it can only be played on one GBA with alternating turns, similar to the hot seat mode in Advance Wars.While Advance Wars and Fire Emblem are better than Rebelstar, it's nice to have another strategy choice on the GBA. Rebelstar Tactical Command doesn't live up to either of the aforementioned titles, or to the legacy of the original X-Com, but it's a good GBA game that will appeal to more sophisticated gamers, and it's certainly addictive enough to eat up a lot of time on a plane or road trip.", "date": "Sep 9, 2005"}
