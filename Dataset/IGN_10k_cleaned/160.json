Its catalog of available titles is simply overflowing with different ways to simulate the experience of owning and riding a pony, and it seems like new ones are arriving every week  that's the case again today, as DSI Games' Championship Pony has now debuted on store shelves alongside previous titles like Petz: Horsez 2, Let's Ride! Friends Forever, Pony Friends, Bratz Ponyz and Horse Life. This stable's starting to get crowded.   And, unfortunately for Championship Pony, the wealth of other options appealing to the same audience of horse-loving DS owners means that there will be little chance for it to make much of an impression  a truth that's only further encouraged by the fact that this package does little to innovate beyond what's already been offered in those other games.   Championship Pony, as those others, casts you in the role of a young rider just getting started with his or her first horse. You begin the game by creating your character and selecting your steed, and then it's off to the expected menu screen with the expected options. You can visit the stables. You can shop at the shop. You can go to the pasture for a bit of fresh air, or dive right into training activities. All status quo and unsurprising.   The blue circle shifts and slides by the input of your stylus, then guides your horse correspondingly.  It's not until one of the training events actually begins that you first see the subtle differences in design that Championship Pony offers. Its primary individual feature is the method of control used to guide your horse in running and jumping. It's a mechanic built on your interaction with a large blue circle icon displayed on the touch screen. You place your stylus on the circle and push it around the screen. In doing so, the direction of your pushing determines the direction the horse will gallop up above. Pushing the blue circle to the top-center of the screen means the pony runs straight ahead. Pushing it to the side means it turns, pushing it to the bottom-center means it slows down and stops.   It's an intuitive design decision that works well, and while it's not as responsive as it could be it still serves as a solid foundation for Championship Pony's riding activities. The problem, though, is that Championship Pony only has two riding activities. There's basic running, which tasks you to guide your ride through gates in sequence or just follow a trail through a nature area, and then there's jumping, which tasks you to do the same thing but to also occasionally double-tap the touch screen to command your horse to leap over a fence or low wall.   And that's it for the ~action~ activities. The only other thing there is to compete in in Championship Pony is dressage, but that plays out in a totally different way  arrow icons appear on the top screen and you simply have to touch the same icon on the bottom screen to make a match. Altogether, running, jumping and dressage competitions form the entire core experience in Championship Pony. And after the ~story mode~ (which doesn't really have any story at all) takes you through six different countries around the world, you're all done. Three competitions, six countries  so after playing 18 mini-games, essentially, the experience here concludes.   It's that lack of longevity, more than anything else, that keeps Championship Pony from standing out among the crowd of other, similar games here on the DS. You can continue to play the game by buying other horses and riding them, or by using your winnings to purchase different grooming styles, saddles and the like from the game's shop  but the selection there is so limited and basic that even that adds no real lasting value to the package. The blue circle mechanic used to guide your horse's movements through the DS touch screen was a step in the right direction, but Championship Pony needed more than just that one trick. Even the most promising and accessible gameplay mechanics have to be followed up with some kind of depth, and this game just doesn't have it  there are only three types of events to compete in and the experience is over far too quickly. Once again, horse-loving players of Nintendo's dual-screened system will be better off betting on a different game.", "date": "Apr 11, 2008"}
