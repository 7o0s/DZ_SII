Not when you've got three titles that can each brag about bringing something completely unique and original to the genre. For Dark Summit, the contribution comes in the structure of the game itself -- this isn't a racer, it's not even a trick-based game, though there are elements of both. What it is is a snow-based platformer that just happens to have you on boards instead of running about on furry feet. Replace mushrooms with tricks, take out Goombas and stretch them out into ranger uniforms, and you'll start to get the picture.  You play as Naya, a happy go-lucky post-apocalyptic gal that's found choice snow, along with other snowboarders, in massive Mt. Garrick. Unfortunately Chief O'Leary and his lackeys don't want you there -- and specifically, nowhere near the back side of the mountain where something mysterious is going on. Don't worry, all of this will be painted for you in broad strokes when you start playing, but the fun is in the process, not the discovery.  Gameplay: You start on the lower mountain, finding and conquering short goals to gain lift points to get higher and higher on the mountain, discovering the keys to getting your frozen butt to the dark side of Mt. Garrick. At the same time you'll want to pull off tricks as often as possible, as they'll give you experience points that you can use towards getting new boards and new outfits. The mountain is massive, with tons of shortcuts that gain you access to experience point bonuses, new tricks, and the mission booths you'll need to get you precious lift points. While you're not picking and choosing your mission at the start of a level, you can choose which goals to head to on the mountain, and whether or not to use them -- thankfully, Radical Entertainment has also included a Restart Mission command so that you can keep retrying a specific mission without having to board down the entire mountain to find it again.  The game gives you a variety of tasks, from chasing specific characters, racing away from rangers and other no-gooders (that's the closest the game gets to actual racing), to trick and environment based challenges. Can you pull off a 3x, 4x and 5x combo in order, using the terrain park? How about finding the cave that Ranger Rick is hiding out in? Maybe you'd rather just launch the big gun and run away from a huge avalanche... in Dark Summit, it's free form, but still very goal-based. You're never trying to just hit score totals to get to another level -- you're exploring, finding goals, and winning in order to unlock special sections of the game, and ultimately get that O'Leary, and good.  Controls are simpler than most snowboarding games -- Naya adjust to the terrain as she lands, so you just have to focus on getting her upright. She grinds on rails like glue, and you'll be hard pressed to make her fall off them once you've got her locked on. Pulling off tricks is as easy as pie. Tricks are broken down by a grind button, a grab button, and a handplant button that's only used in halfpipes. You can tweak tricks with the triggers, and there's a selection of special tricks at your disposal by doing key combinations. The cool gimmick in Dark Summit, however, is that you only get new tricks by finding them on the mountain, hidden at the end of remote grind rails, or high off of jumps. If you want to do some of the more elaborate tricks in the game, you'll have to do some exploring.  If there's a fault to the game, it's that it hints at a more complex experience, but never really delivers. There are only four boards to unlock, and it's unclear how they affect how your play, other than that they're of a general ~better faster more~ design. You'll always auto-adjust to face the ground correctly, so while doing tricks is fun, it's a little too easy to feel like a constant challenge. Also, because you're unlocking equipment through totals, not through specific trick bonuses, you're actually rewarded for playing badly and having to repeat the game's missions, as that means you'll be racking up more points as you repeat combos and tricks. The developers have chosen to put the challenge in the individual goals that you uncover rather than structure the whole game around a certain skill level, but it would have been nice to have had a bit of both.  Once you've gotten the hang of the game, you'll find yourself breezing through it faster than you expect -- it's not a short game by any means, but since replay value isn't the same as a racer or a trick-based game (you'll find yourself replaying specific missions, but rarely entire levels), it doesn't have the same limitless appeal of many games of this type.  Graphics: The characters look great in-game, and animations for the tricks are completely unrealistic and fun to watch, fitting in with the mood of the game completely. There's a mixture of natural and manmade environmental design going on in the way that levels are built, making the mountain itself a great place to visit, even if you'd rather not live there among the mines and the atomic -- never mind. Spray painted logos spatter over the ice, and huge pylons and rafters, chunks of cement and destroyed structures pepper the view, most of which you can grind, jump over, or race through. The physics for objects in the game are the most impressive factor. Hit a snowman, and his parts will tumble down the hill alongside you, depending on how hard you've hit them, and the slope of the mountain. Giant signs will explode and scrape down the hill as you bust through them, and electrified fences will smash open as you rush through them -- it's all done very well, with the realistic physics adding an extra gravy sauce over the meaty destruction.  The down side to all of this is that there's some serious draw in going on with major objects, and if you peek up beyond what's directly in front of you, you'll catch buildings popping in piece by piece as you approach, sometimes right over your head. Sadly, as you get faster boards in the game you'll find the draw in becoming more apparent, since you're approaching objects at much faster speeds. There are some framerate issues as well -- while the game generally keeps to 30fps, you'll find that it starts to chunk down, or stutter much too often while you're playing. It's never bad enough to affect gameplay, but it's definitely noticeable, and at times, annoying.  Sound: I'm still impressed with the soundtrack for the game -- while it's not hugely varied, it's filled with enough depth to hook you in. Maybe I'm just a junky for Drum n' Bass, but I loved the music choices for the game, and appreciated how the music would chime in, depending on what you were doing, or the stress of the mission you were on. The electronic touch also lends itself to the trick sounds, which have a keyboard chirp sound that's the ultimate pat on the back for pulling off insane combos. Voices in the game are pretty solid, still in the world of ~this rocks, dude!~ but not quite cheery enough to get annoying. The talking is kept pretty slim from the main characters, which is welcome, and most voices are passing skiers and rangers, who are actually pretty funny. I never tired of hearing a ranger chide ~broken bones never heal!~ when I raced by him at high speeds.  Multiplayer/Replay Value Multiplayer's present in the game, though it's pretty minimal. You've got a standard race, a destruction race where you're given a point for every object you crash into, and a half-pipe trick battle. While they're fun for a moment,  but they're pretty straightforward and you'll find yourself moving back into the single play game for something a little meatier. It's a nice addition, but more a bullet-point for the box than a full-fledged multiplayer feature set.  If you beat the game you'll be able to play as the other characters you encounter in the game, but the overall structure is identical -- in fact, you'll see the same cutscenes, only with the new characters standing in for Naya, dialogue and all. It's not enough to truly keep you playing the game, as there's little to do in terms of new tricks and areas to explore, but the fact that they've allowed you to play as the other characters from the game is a nice bonus. Dark Summit's a unique take on the snowboarding genre, and has some great ideas, not to mention some original gameplay. The overall package just lacks a certain depth that keeps this game from really staying with you, and from challenging you, especially as you get farther in the game. There's a lot of hinting and touching on the additional features that would have made this game even more interesting, like character building, more unique equipment, or variable difficulties on goals, but they're never truly implemented into the final product.Radical's done a great job of thinking outside of the boundaries when it comes to snowboarding games, and hopefully the next installment of the Dark Summit franchise will deliver the layers and depth that can truly make this game shine.", "date": "Nov 15, 2001"}
