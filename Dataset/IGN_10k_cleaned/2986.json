Writing about online-centric shooters is hazardous work ideally rewarded with hazard pay that I certainly do not get. Garbage men pity me. Nuclear waste disposal technicians hang their heads in sorrow as I shamble past. See, the fans, fanboys, and fanatics associated with these games can often be the most rabid, disgruntled, ignorant, vocal, and downright crazy bunch of PC using lunatics in all of gaming. A stereotype? Not if it's 100% accurate and 100% capable of brutally murdering you in the office parking lot as you retreat home for the evening.   Foolishly labeling the link gun a plasma rifle in even the most obscure screenshot merits death. Mistakenly calling a domination control point a flag area for the sake of prose is punishable by everlasting Chinese water torture. Not giving the game -- for which these most diehard of avid players have apparently devoted their entire lives to -- the exact score they dreamt of whilst contemplating new ways to blow things up on the toilet is such a horrendous offense that there is no consequence known to man. And the worst part, even if I do write out exactly what they're thinking they'll still complain that mine was the article that lacked enough verbose justification to prove to everyone else in the known universe that what they thought was right all along.  I hate them. They scare me like a kitten being attacked by an evil, sentient vacuum cleaner that climbs stairs and trees. True, I hate and am afraid of a lot of people and things (I dare you to touch me there again, Dan), but needlessly aggressive behavior without style, humor, or any intellectual backing irks me, a lot. It's with great remorse and reservation that I write these articles, for I know the inevitable backlash will eventually be the death of me.   Since half of you are already appropriately angry, go ahead and save yourself the time of reading through this lengthy review and directly email me at pc_mail@ign.com. Don't worry about what you say. Many of those who do ~read~ my articles still have no clue what they're talking about, so go wild.   In cleverly marketing Unreal Tournament 2003 as a sort of sports title set for yearly or, more likely, bi-yearly iterations, Epic and Digital Extremes have nicely positioned, protected, and allowed themselves the opportunity to refine the game to be more like sports entertainment, without having to ditch much of the first title to make something totally new and thus acceptable.   Since it can now be seen and taken as a year to year product (or something to that effect) -- a sporting event that improves things that need improving -- similarities from one year to the next can't be as drastically debilitating. You can't knock Madden because it looks and plays like Madden, after all.  But, that alibi is not airtight (commence the obscene feedback). The game still has a few shortcomings. Shortcomings are not problems, mind you (commence the not so obscene but still lewd feedback).   I actually preferred Quake III over UT, probably because I was a master at it, capable of beating all comers and even the singleplayer mode on nightmare (Xaero and his bitch-ass rail gun were no match for my shotgun at close ranges). I still recognize UT as great, and I even continually played its InstaGib until this bad boy came to town, but Unreal Tournament 2003 actually feels a lot more like Quake than UT. The aura of id's opus seems to have seeped into many aspects of this game. Happy me. Confused you.   It starts with the visuals. Of course the graphics are awesome. Please don't make me say anything else. Speaking for any kind of length, let alone a great one, on UT 2003's visuals would be like describing how the sky is blue again and again and again when you already know it's freaking blue.   You've played the demo and seen the movies. This game features a visual luster that's virtually unrivaled in today's marketplace, but that doesn't mean that some aspects of the greater good are not without fault. Character models, while brilliantly animated and full of life, fall a bit short when it comes to raw polygonal detail... A bit short if you're an idiot and compare them to DoA 3. In case you didn't catch that, I'm saying they're awesome, pretty much like everything else.  Physics? Check. Environments? Check. Characters? Check. Weapons? Check. Effects? Check. Textures? Sort of check (no bump-mapping that you're not going to care about exists).  It's got 'em all and it's got 'em Quake-ified. Models, weapons, maps, effects, and general art all seem to take rather large cues from UT's arch nemesis. I've already seen it turning off a lot of players. ~That fan looks familiar. Those characters are Unreal? Hey, I've seen those textures before. Wow, these maps are awfully moody.~ It's not that this slight shift is a problem, but that it's a difference, and for those average players like my own brother, born and raised on Unreal and deathly afraid of demons and flaming skulls that spew lava, the game ~just feels more like Quake.~   A lot of the interior, futuristic levels are less sci-fi slickness and more techno-gothic with boding and still amazing architecture. Nearly all exhibit more of a sinister, dirty feel. Some also fail to amaze with the kind of exotic originality that made a few in Unreal Tournament so grand. What I mean is that the modular design of the game seems to carry over a bit much. Each map is distinct, but a bunch share qualities of others that make them appear very similar. In feel they are noticeably different, naturally. Some, like my favorites Inferno and Plunge are very cool, while others rely more on decorating familiar kill runs with cool scenery. Thankfully, ones like the new Facing Worlds serve to remind of why Unreal is not all about the innards of a starship or the lower level of a parking structure.      At first it was hard for me to accept Unreal Tournament 2003 for what it is. I came in expecting a lot. I dreamt of playing next-generation maps in outlandish and amazing locales and designs, perhaps a little SiN flavored Paradox, or an over-sized room where all combatants are but the size of mice. None of that happened. When I came to grips with UT 2003, I delightfully learned its joys are still those that enthralled players of its parent: lighting fast gameplay, largely honed and balanced weapons, and general suaveness.   And the more and more I play the maps available, the more I like them. After a while the graphics started to blur. They look nice, but now take a backseat to the play -- that moment when you learn the personality of your date is also good. Once you've mastered weapon and especially translocator use, it all comes together.   Throwing the little personal transporter around a corner knowing full well you're going to have to double dodge forward and jump to breeze by a few enemies to get into that sweet spot you've been clamoring for is what the game's all about. Surprisingly, the overly detailed environs rarely, if ever inhibit this kind of play, even in the most heated of bouts. They've been crafted in such a way to prevent heads from getting stuck on low girders and foots from getting caught on overly detailed nuts and bolts. The little touches like actually being able to move while a merciless predator known as FattyMcGee unleashes lighting at you, are nice.  Without this thoughtful approach, using an adrenaline boost like speed would spell certain death. They come in a few flavors, but essentially adrenaline, when collected, allows a character to perform a special function like run fast or cloak. These are accomplished by consecutively tapping keys on that board in front of you. Proper use of adrenaline means victory over defeat in a heated CTF match-up.   I hold fast to my previous Twisted Metal analogy. The sequel is the same basic deathmatch game as the first, only honed, refined, and brought together with combos that are easy to pull off. Some people, bothered by the prospect of having to hit more than one key in sequence, feel the adrenaline to be either unnecessary or unwanted. I think it's great -- a little extra spice to keep that not so nice rocket off my ass. It ties in with Digital Extreme's insistence on moving to a more skill-based game.   There's no luck in using adrenaline. You either know why and when you're using it and you do or you don't. Busting out a speed boost won't win the day like blindly laying out five rockets in the original UT would. It was hoped and planned from day one that the reliance on blind shots and lucky getaways would be a thing of the past, and it is mostly is.  Weapon refinements are the next on the block. There's not much that's really, truly new. Some look different, act different, but then fulfill the same basic function, yet with lighting instead of a sniper bullet, as an example. Anyone's who's played UT will be immediately familiar with the arsenal and its effective/ineffectiveness. It's good that adjustment time is nonexistent. It's bad that a load of new has not been added. Yes the lighting gun and two default weapons are new, but one is like the sniper, one is like a dual enforcers/grenade launcher combination, and the other replaces the impact hammer, add riot shield.   Little changes and balancing modifications are where the true, but slight difference comes in. Link gun team up, slower splashing mini-gun alternate fire, rocket launcher limitations, the nicknamed ~impossible to find~ redeemer, a tighter flak cannon and so forth make it fresh. Because they're so familiar to what we've seen in the past, jumping into them is easy. Because they're refined, a slightly new play style that still adheres to the old adage of not fixing what ain't broke is apparent.   I had hoped to see the planned vehicles of Unreal Championship (hover bike like things, not anything special), but their exclusion is not one that bugs. The mode changes do irk, however.   Team deathmatch, deathmatch, and capture the flag remain. The domination change is bad. This new one tries to emphasize the skill and teamwork the rest of the game does by forcing players to hold a combination of ~control points~ for an allotted time. That's noble, and comes together nicely when played with cooperative teammates. But, completely getting rid of something that's old but good is just wrong... Like Assault. Why oh why this mode was omitted, especially in light of the development team's insistence to bolster teamwork, is beyond me.   How the N64 and its sorely aging Perfect Dark or even Goldeneye can beat out modern next-generation PC games in terms of included modes is beyond me. Where's my tag, assimilation, assassin, jailbreak? By now these should all be mandatory inclusions into online shooters. Why the hell are they not in here?   But we do get bombing run, a nifty diversion from the norm that's best played on a LAN. It's like rugby. You pick up a ball, pass it to your buddies, and try and ram it down the throats of the competition while murdering everyone in your path. Homeboy who has the ball cannot shoot. Good. Passing the ball to a friend to free yourself up for a little offense/defense combo is futile. Bad. It seems that no one on the face of the Earth, especially in this office, knows how to coordinate. When I don't have the ball, your priorities should change to shooting the one with it, opposed to pursuing me until I die. It's a problem with the people, not the game. Tossing the love above the heads of the enemy, assuming they don't double or quad jump with the help of a mutator to snatch it, is quite cool. Again, a lot of the more subtle and fantastic aspects of the bombing run require shouting distance, but that's not to say network code isn't up to snuff.   Don't ever play on anything less than broadband. That's the general rule with all games, but UT 2003 has some polished netcode that lets the baseband loons have at it. Like always, anything LAN, good ping, and dedicated runs well. Everything else is everything else.        As I mentioned, the dynamics change with the mutators (things that alter the game). There a bunch this time around (12). Some are useful, some not so much. Currently, ones like Vampire (being rewarded with health when you inflict pain), QuadJump and InstaGib are big hits, while others more serve as those novel things that get checked out once for laughs.   The sampling of included mutators is small compared to what will come in the future. With technology this advanced and modding support being one of the major priorities of the team, creative, salivating fans are all over the place. Standards like Counter-Strike clones, weapon mods, models, and mutators will come, sure. But who's to say the game has to stop at the expected norm? Thanks to the miracle of email, I was informed of other zany ideas, like a bowling mod called Vendetta Bowling that promises to capitalize off of the new physics system to create a mod that's different.   Unreal's mutator/modding system has always been awesome. I can think of many more gimmicks and gameplay affecting mutators I'd like to have seen included, but the few that are there and readily played to enhance the game are not only nice and appreciable additions, but still something Epic can claim is all their own.   And when you're done tooling around with the mutators and whooping everyone in the office in deathmatch, you can turn on the singleplayer game and enjoy some very good bots, provided you tell them to be good.   Because they are all dependant on both difficulty and a set of attributes like accuracy, aggressiveness, teamwork, and tactics, bots can range from totally inapt to indestructible. Difficulty aside, the differences in skill sets are noticeable. Take tactics: a character with a low rating is more likely to fumble about the map, perhaps walk the wrong way, camp, duck instead of jump, not dodge, run erratically with the flag, etcetera. While one with a high level will do the exact opposite. This is pretty awesome.  What's better is that throughout singleplayer (each of the game's modes of play advancing through maps up to a singular end), skills of your team and individuals improve based on what's happening. To spice it up, a trading option that you can refuse or force an acceptance on has been implemented.   It's pretty clear that the singleplayer mode and accompanying bots are still around to spice up multiplayer or act as a nice diversion, but that's just because this feels more like a first baby step into a land more soaked by the sports-like feel to the game (just watch the intro). I have complaints with some of the AI as it applies to bombing run, but it's very hard to tell where the difficulty and skill sets stop and the game's limitations begin, so it can slide, especially considering that this is a multiplayer action game. Let us not forget that many titles don't have bots at all.   Finally, sound... While the explosions and thuds of corpses are satisfying to the eyes and ears, the game is chalked full of a terrible kind of pre-pubescent cherished, insolent, and just plain aggravating voice work. ~Die bitch!~ Now repeat that about a hundred times and occasionally interject things like ~Turn the safety off~ and you'll know what's up. Long bouts riddled with rough voices and tough guy attitudes quickly lose their appeal.   The announcer is worse. Domination games get especially asstastic. His enthusiastic and constant blurbs get so annoying that the only joy you'll find from him is the thoughtful ability to mute the bastard.   Why complain if it can be muted? Mute is not audio. I can mute any game and crank out perfect tens, so the inclusion of a ~stop the aggravating crap~ setting isn't so much good, but rather a welcome relief. The aggravating crap, you see, shouldn't have been there in the first place.   Since the game is such a bold first step toward a more sports flavored cake, we should have seen jibes and clever quips to accentuate the standard and always lame remarks that amount to ~I shot you. You suck.~ More personality needs to go in and the rehashed dribble like ~Ownage~ needs to come out. A lot more individual quips associated with each type of character personality (I'm not so crazy to expect every player to be unique) would have greatly added to the feel. The artificial life form could talk about how he's reaping vengeance for the abused toasters of the world. The mutants could be less angry and more stupid, mispronouncing things and throwing out insults with little sense. The true humans could be intellectuals, but sissies with their jabs. Those Hellraiser clown folks could babble crazily, and the Egyptians could talk about papyrus and how if we were playing on sand, everyone would be losing. Anything but ~You're a whore,~ please.   What did you think of UT 2003?  Music fares much better. The menu system is essentially Deus Ex's epic sci-fi theme that's still familiar for a computer game. I even thought it was that one at first. In matches, however, I often feel like I'm playing through Descent. The moody techno that picks up and drags sounds very comparable to that game, but never begs to be muted like that horrible announcer.   Die bitch. Denying Unreal Tournament 2003 its rightful place in the upper echelons of this genre/sub-genre that it so effortlessly succeeds at is hard work. One would have to be quite jaded, discriminatory, close-minded, and vigilant to justify dismissing the game's many charms and delights.By either retooling or omitting some modes, including a wretched announcer and vocal component, and then relying heavily on visually impressive, but sometimes familiar maps, the game fails to achieve the perfection it seeks, and now has to settle with simply being really damn excellent. Darn. Sci-Fi powered deathmatch may be straightforward and bland to a lot of the crazies engulfed in the current realism enthused fad, but the style is still viable and quite entertaining. Despite the shift in development toward more involved, deeper, or realistic premises, a classic reflex driven shooter can be great if properly done by a team of seasoned professionals. When you take the concept of the twitch, throw it into an extremely stylized backdrop and then thoughtfully deliver the entire damn thing with precision, patience, care, and nearly limitless expandability, the insane competition that's already there becomes fantastic. The fantastic is Unreal.Those zoned out, hardcore adrenaline junkies whose bony fingers curl over and clench anything that moves 500 miles an hour need not look any further. UT's beautiful skin may be somewhat simple, but its biology is complex, lovely, and fun. Fun... Remember that one?", "date": "Sep 27, 2002"}
