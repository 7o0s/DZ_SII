Though the studio missed the DS launch window for its first dual-screen product, Shin'en has made another impressive showing with Nanostray, an unofficial follow-up to its Iridion series. Once again the studio shows that it has a tight grasp on giving gamers an overwhelming visual experience, as this game is an absolute treat to see on the DS. It's also an energetic and fun old-school design, with a fair share of little quirks that could and should have been ironed out during its production cycle.   Nanostray moves Shin'en's expertise in the shoot-em-up genre out of the Game Boy Advance and onto the Nintendo DS. What they learned in Iridion II has clearly been applied to this DS game, as the two games feel extremely similar in concept and design. Nanostray is just a balls-to-the-wall arcade shooter in the vein of Raiden or Axelay, using these classics, as well as more contemporary hits like Ikaruga for its design inspiration. There's even flashes of Galaga in place where players are rewarded with pick-ups by blasting specific clusters of enemies before they zip off-screen.   There's no denying that Nanostray is easily one of the most visually impressive titles on the Nintendo DS system. Forget the fact that most of the imagery is simply background eye candy -- it's still absolutely stunning to see the game generate all the incredibly well-rendered 3D visuals in realtime, at 60 frames per second, flowing across the screen with breathtaking fluidity. Like all good shoot-em-ups, the action remains energetic through most of the game, though there are rare occasions when the processor chug creeps in during particularly crowded moments. Blast a smart bomb in a crowd of enemies while firing the superweapon in a tight area, and you'll see the game slow down. But this is in the extreme, and in 99 percent of the action you'll never see this speed drop.   It's clear that the focus was more on the technical side of things,  but that doesn't mean the gameplay has taken a backseat to the imagery. The game within the sweet candy shell is solid, fun, and challenging, offering an energetic rush of action using nothing but the basics of old-school game design. The 3D engine does allow the level designers to throw in some clever elements that bring background elements into the playfield; ships will rise up or drop down onto the player's plane of action, and environments, like volcanoes, electrical towers, and building structures create obstacles that players will have to maneuver around while blasting the incoming enemies. The melding of foreground and background does cause some unfair issues the first time through the game, since it's not always clear when and where objects will become harmful to the player's ship. But because the levels are entirely pattern and memorization-based, these spots can easily be noted for the next bazillion times through.   Nanostray is, essentially, a vertical shooter that's been tipped at an angled perspective. For some reason, though, the designers left in hard ~barriers~ on the left and right of the screen, which prevents the player's ship from reaching the very left and right edge of the playing field. Power-up tokens will frequently appear beyond these invisible boundaries, which makes things a little unfair for players who blast enemies before they appear on-screen. What seems to be a ~fix~ for this problem is the ability to ~attract~ tokens to the ship using the R trigger; but since there's no penalty for using this ability, players can simply hold down the button forever, sucking every single token up like a powerful vacuum. Handy, yes. But it absolutely kills the fun and challenge of manually scooping up power-ups before these pick-ups vanish off-screen.   The insistence of using the touch-screen for weapon selection is a game design mistake. Nanostray features many instances where you'll need to switch from forward-blasting lasers to side-mounted turrets to blast enemies on the left and right of the ship, but to switch between the four different cannons requires players to move their eyes from the action down to the touch screen to tap the on-screen icon representing the particular weapon. This motion forces players to take their attention away from the main screen as well as move their hand off the fire button to swap blasters, which can be extremely hazardous to the ship. Having the L trigger as an additional action button helps things a bit, but what the designers should have done was simply use the shoulder buttons to control weapon switching.       Nanostray is admittedly an extremely short game that can be completed in only a couple of hours thanks to unlimited continues, but its quick-appearing (and somewhat unsatisfying) end sequence is a bit misleading. This shooter actually has a lot of replay value after the fact; not only are there varying levels of difficulty to try, there are a whole slew of special challenges to complete. Each of these challenges are based in a specific adventure mode level, with a specific criteria to meet; in some cases, you'll only get a single life to complete the mission. In others, you'll need to score a set number of points. These missions are unbelievably challenging, almost frustratingly so, but they certainly can be defeated. And it's a personal victory when they're taken down one by one.   The development team also put a lot of effort into two player wireless, giving players the opportunity to compete against each other in original levels of Nanostray action. These multiplayer modes are certainly fun and add to the length of the Nanostray experience. But the way they've been implemented almost makes the game feel like it was yanked out of the programmer's hands before they were done -- the challenges simply end with absolutely no fanfare, and the only way you'll ever know if you're the winner is if your own screen has a poorly-rendered trophy marking you the victor. The game fails to lay out the score after the fact to show players if it was a tight match or an absolute blow-out.  Nanostray is not a creative showcase for the unique functions of the Nintendo DS system --this game isn't going to win any awards for its touch-screen ideas. What this game does, however is give the Nintendo DS library a real kick in the pants with an energetic production, fast-paced action, and some extremely challenging elements that will keep you going for some time. The little design issues keep the game out of a ~classic~ status, but honestly, it's hard not to have a blast with this original Nintendo DS title.", "date": "Jul 19, 2005"}
