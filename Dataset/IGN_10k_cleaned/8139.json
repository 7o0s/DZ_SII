It's easier to catch your breath and the quality of each project seems to increase over the years, even if many make only small improvements on old features. CDV in particular is certainly trying to put out some higher quality efforts and their newest RTS, War Front: Turning Point is another step in that direction. Though still set in World War II, the game takes a twist on the war and manages to serve up a decent to good RTS experience. Let's be clear, there's really nothing here that's new. If you're looking for a groundbreaking title, you'll need to look elsewhere. This is a traditional action RTS title through and through. Others out there offer new features and ideas but anyone looking for a traditional RTS to fill the void certainly could do worse than picking up this fast-paced brawl.   World War II has been used a lot as a setting in the genre and trying to trump a game like Company of Heroes is a daunting task. It's a good thing that CDV and developer Digital Reality (probably best known for their Imperium Galactica and Hegemonia games) chose to work in an alternate history of the war where Hitler died early on changing events significantly. It allows for familiarity of subject to combine with experimental weapons. It also provides a bit of freedom for battle locations and how the story unfolds.    The story itself was obviously given some production love. It attempts to be something special by creating brash campy characters and plots of personal vendetta and duty. Sadly, it isn't really very special. The characters are forgettable, laughable, and so stereotypical as to be beyond the threshold of good B-movie campiness and into bad C-movie terribleness. Part of the issue is that the camera work in the (mostly) well produced cutscenes is dramatic, well choreographed, and didn't fit the dialogue where dorky lead men run around in jeans after ~babes~ while talking trash. The level of seriousness in the cuts is too high for the low comedy of the writing creating a pretty large disconnect. The voice-work doesn't really help either. While I'm sure the actors were told to ham it up, listening to the dialogue is more like drowning in hot bacon grease. That said, it was still nice to see the attention being given to presentation with the cutscenes. Even if they weren't perfect, most of them were enjoyable when characters weren't speaking.    Presentation, in general, was up and down. While those cutscenes served the game well, even with the craptastic script, little details like the American victory symbol of the flag being raised at Iwo Jima was a bit out of place. That part of the war was in Japan, after all, while War Front takes place in Europe. More importantly, the interface is a bit clunky on all accounts. Some buttons are in odd places, there's no real tutorial, and some modes aren't available in skirmish that are available in multiplayer.    The campaign has its moments, but is mostly standard fare. While the difficulty level varies pretty widely, once you grasp the basics of how a base operates and how to upgrade, things become pretty straight forward, even on hard. Unfortunately there are very few creative missions to provide any new kind of excitement that RTS fans haven't seen before. Almost every mission ends with the destruction of an enemy base. Thankfully secondary objectives help keep things a little more interesting. Oftentimes completing those secondary objectives will seriously help the progression of a mission to victory. They're optional, but are definitely worth completing to mix up the action a tiny bit.    Campaign missions progress rather predictably in most ways including the inclusion of  friendly AI (fairly incompetent, I have yet to see a friendly AI base survive the majority of a campaign mission without my direct intervention) or a surprise important objective. One American mid-mission objective challenges players to defend a mountaintop radio station from a strong attack. This challenge comes without warning after the friendly AI captures the radio building. The problem is that you really have to have the correct mix of units to protect the objective and they need to be there immediately so that the building isn't destroyed. If you've been happily sitting in your base or attending to other objectives, trying to run this one down and complete it on the first run though is really, really hard. Trial and error isn't something I particularly like in an RTS since it can take so long to build up.   Once again, those looking for an action packed traditional RTSs where plenty of stuff blows up nice and pretty, you'll probably enjoy the campaigns just fine because things blow up pretty damn frequently. Whether tanks are suffering explosive damage, buildings are collapsing, or nukes are being dropped, there's no lack of explosions here which just backs up the gun slinging feeling. The game in general looks pretty darn good even if unit models themselves aren't particularly exciting.     The units are probably one of my biggest issues. It's been hard for me to really love any of them. The starting tanks and vehicles are basically useless and while bigger tanks are unleashed along with neat conceptual units like the Ice Spitter, the power and tenseness of battle just wasn't there for me. That's not to say that some of the units aren't fun to use. The zepplins and underground APCs in particular are some of the more interesting vehicles, and dropping nukes or purposefully crashing planes into enemy bases is always fun, but after big time concussions of Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander, it's hard not to miss those games a little bit while playing this one. It's a little because of the scale, a little because of the visuals, and a lot because of the sound, which just isn't particularly impressive. Great soundwork can make units more real than they are on screen and I just wasn't feeling it here.    With all of that said, the framework is good for traditional RTS gameplay. There are enough meaningful differences between sides such as the American air superiority or Russian fortifiable units, there's plenty to appreciate. While many of the lower range units are similar in function, the specialty units really do make a difference. The Russian Ice Splitter Tank is amazing for helping to take down base defenses as frozen buildings and units crack very quickly under fire.  The German Sonic Tank on the other hand can rip through basically anything on the ground but are incredibly fragile. It's a real arms race in this game to develop a counter for whatever the enemy is putting on the table.   This kind of chess match is obviously much more apparent in single and multiplayer skirmish. These matches can be fast and furious and if you're playing against AI, expect plenty of aggression. Only deathmatch is available in games with AI opponents. The challenge really varies from game to game about how hard the hard AI really is. It can make some seriously strange decisions. For instance, one match all of the AI, friendly and enemy became confused and built multiple research facilities and one airfield when it should have been the other way around. Pathfinding AI also seems to have some problems as groups of units start and stop their way across long distances instead of continuously moving. Overall, AI skirmishes can add a bit of life to the game, but isn't strong enough to last forever.    Two other modes of play are also available in multiplayer. These modes, Conquest and Secret Orders are definitely the big winners in the whole package. While AI can't be added to fill out a player roster, the idea behind the games are strong. Conquest is a bit more familiar as players vie for control over territory on the map with players who can hold it for the longest crowed as victor. Secret Orders is even better. At the beginning of each match players are given special win conditions. These objectives are theirs alone and everyone else on the map will be going after different objectives. Once players find out what that goal is, which happens when players are halfway there, all hell is going to break loose. In some ways, it's actually better to stay a little behind in the race until combatants focus their attentions on the current front runner. Definitely some cool ideas for multiplayer. Unfortunately, right now you may have a hard time finding competition. Our forays online recently have been met with empty lobbies. Hopefully that will change before long as gamers catch wind.War Front: Turning Point is a good RTS game. There are some clever mechanics at work in some cases but the campaign missions and overall unit design weren't particularly impressive. While the game is fun, I've still found myself wanting to play other titles that are out and about right now that offer a bit more. Even so, fans of traditional RTS games will have a great time playing through a very traditional campaign while having a bit of a chance to challenge friends to the more creative portions of multiplayer. War Front isn't without faults, but is still a solid enough title.", "date": "Feb 28, 2007"}
