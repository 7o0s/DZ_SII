Macrospace's Fatal Force is a hard-hitting shooter that takes place in remote, frozen Siberia -- the site of a deadly impact from a massive object heralding from outside of our solar system. It's up to you to secure the site and drive away whatever foreign enemy is gathering its strength in this excellent take off of SNK's Metal Slug series.   Features:   Three playable characters  Multiple weapons  Bluetooth deathmatch mode   Digital Bridges has already brought the original side-scroller action-shooter to handsets, but Fatal Force handily surpasses that port thanks to its mobile genesis. Built for handsets, Fatal Force is designed to take precautions against potential shortcomings of cellphones like small screen size and limited control options.   Most gamers will immediately jump right into the game's story mode, which details a one-player effort to reach the heart of the alien menace. When you begin, you must set up your call sign (to be used in single- and multi-player modes) select from three Russian warriors: the average Nikolai, the speedy Jade, or the powerful Leon. Each player can defeat the aliens, but choose according to your game play style.   Then it's right into the action. Fatal Force starts you off easy, giving you only a few cursory droids to shoot down while you acquaint yourself with the controls. Your hero can naturally run and jump, but they also possess bullet time which allows them to slow things down and pull off some precision shots.   There are many platforming elements to the game, and thankfully, the control is pretty solid. Jumping can be done by pressing w=either up or ~2,~ and we suspect that to make some tricky leaps, you'll use the number key.   As you delve deeper into Siberia, trying to blast aliens and find your comrades, you must collect bonus points and power-ups, conveniently strewn about in small crates. Power-ups include better weapons, auto-fire, more bullet time, and health increases. The aliens also get smarter, faster, and shoot a lot more bullets in your general direction.   Before long, you're knee-deep in a very manic, very fun little actioner. The visuals are really appealing, nice and cartoony, like the SNK classic -- but different enough for the game to have a style of its own. The aliens range from small droids and turrets to massive, big-headed beasts. Backgrounds are varied and detailed, and the game makes excellent use of color. We tested it on an N-Gage QD, and were impressed by Macrospace's craftsmanship.   Fatal Force has a continuous soundtrack that includes some very catchy, arcade-style tunes. Sadly, this is at the expense of sound effects. With all the explosions in Fatal Force, we're surprised Macrospace didn't opt to go with aural mayhem instead.   Now, Fatal Force has a Bluetooth multi-player element that will appeal to owners of enabled handsets. There are three play modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Domination. Deathmatch is a predictable blast-o-rama, while Domination requires that gamers take and maintain control of scoring spots in the play field. All of these modes have original maps.  Fatal Force in an A+ effort from Macrospace. The single-player game is excellent little romp, complete with enough action to satisfy fans for hours on end. This could be a game on its own, but Macrospace goes the extra mile by including original multi-player modes that will give the game an extra boost of longevity -- as long as players find themselves in an area with enough other Bluetooth handsets with the game already downloaded.", "date": "Aug 4, 2004"}
