{"name": "Rengoku", "name_review": "Rengoku Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/26/rengoku-review", "text": "Rengoku chronicles the story of a cyborg named GRAM that is on the verge of self-awareness. The robot understands that it is a creation, but now seeks answers that explain its existence. Existentialism in a mobile game? Can Hudson pull this one off?   Based on a PlayStation Portable series (two games have been released thus far), Rengoku is an action game with some minor doses of stealth and RPG. You are stuck in a series of seven techno-themed stages, seeking the aforementioned truth. Getting the answer to the Big Why isn't as easy as asking the next cyborg over -- you must spend thousands of bullets and throttle hundreds of enemy robots to find what you're looking for.   The action elements are functional, but not necessarily phenomenal. GRAM comes equipped with a standard-issue sword that can cleave low-level enemies, but to survive tougher battles, including some boss-ish encounters, you must equip GRAM with bigger weapons, such as a slow-but-deadly rifle that flattens mid-range enemies at close range. GRAM will not survive if you just charge into each room with guns blazing, though. Sometimes it pays to stay out of sight, creeping along walls or hiding behind pillars until enemy eyes are trained elsewhere. Spotting enemies can prove tough in certain situations, as the robots will stand close to or behind pillars. These pillars vanish when GRAM approaches them, though, giving you a fuller view -- but by that point, you're close enough to be shot.    The shooting and sword-work is a bit tricky at first. Thanks to the isometric camera, you must use all of the number keys (save for 5) to move around. Crossing a room and shooting up a bad guy isn't necessarily easy during the first few stages, but after some time, I found fluttering my fingers around the edges of the number pad while jamming on 5 to shoot wasn't too bad. You can use an auto-aim feature to help target robots, and I only spent about three rooms with it turned off before I decided to just leave it on for the rest of the game.   Your enemies get increasingly tougher as you move through the game, so you must keep an eye on what works best against certain enemies. Slower foes can be cut down with heavier arms like the Boomer Head, but fast-moving enemies must be either caught with the sword or a faster weapon, such as the SMG. Even thought here is only a handful of weapons, the difference between each of them is good.   There are a number of pick-ups in Rengoku; some are dropped by fallen foes, others by smashing crates. Besides guns and additional ammunition, you can find health pick-ups, weapon power-ups, and speed boosts. You can also upgrade GRAM's functionality by defeating robots and earning experience -- this is the RPG part of Rengoku. After filling the experience bar, GRAM earns a level and upgrade points. You can upgrade legs for speed, for example. If you don't want to manage GRAM's upgrades, you can turn on an auto-upgrade feature that actually does a pretty good job dispersing the power-ups. My complaint with the upgrading mechanic is that the changes in GRAM are not immediately noticeable. Satisfaction needs to be more obvious and direct if you're aiming for an audience that games in short bursts.   Rengoku's environment's are constructed of a series of inter-connected rooms that feature a decent amount of detail. Almost every room has at least two doors. As you push deeper into the game, the levels get more and more labyrinthine by design. Some doors are locked and must be opened with cards. Some areas cannot be exited without defeating a boss robot. The complexity of the mazes is part of the challenge, but you can access a map if you get too lost.   Rengoku is a decent enough game with some interesting features -- such as the robot upgrades -- but I never really hit a groove while playing it. After reaching level three, I felt fairly comfortable with the controls, but I'm concerned about how many people will put in the time to get there. I know the whole ~If you're a fan...~ conclusion is something of a cop-out, but it truly does apply here. Action gamers have better choices than Rengoku on mobile, but fans of the PSP franchise might enjoy this chapter of GRAM's life.", "date": "Jun 26, 2007"}
