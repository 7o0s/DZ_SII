Thumb-numbingly hard. Contra 4 for mobile, released in conjunction with a brand new adventure of the same name on the Nintendo DS, does not break from tradition. This little shooter is mean to the core and if you don't mind spitting out paint-peeling obscenities, you will find a smartly, fine-tuned throwback challenge here.   Contra 4 returns Bill Rizer to the front lines against the alien menace, but this time he's joined by Solomon Caesar, a mobile-exclusive character that was conceived by Stephen Hetrick. (Konami ran a very cool create-a-character contest for Contra 4 on mobile, asking fans to submit hero designs and clever back-stories.) Bill and Solomon must push through seven stages filled with alien nasties, from basic shock troops to screen-filling bosses.   The game mechanics are pure Contra. You run from left to right and blast everything. Incoming troops, floating satellites, wall turrets, winged creeps -- you name it and this game is going to throw it at you. However, while Contra 4 may be a little mean (and I'd be disappointed if it wasn't because that's part of the Contra essence), it isn't merciless to the point it's just un-fun. The pacing of the enemies is challenging and you will replay stages until you somewhat memorize patterns, but it doesn't stack bad guys to the point you only get an extra three feet with each attempt.   Bill and Solomon get a nice arsenal of five weapons and a little gear to survive the threat. They start out with basic machineguns, but power-ups unlock extra firepower, such as a spread gun that sprays the screen and a fireball gun that broils enemies with explosive shells. Having a souped-up weapon is important when closing in on the giant bosses, like the tank. If you're shot (the Contra universe doesn't believe in health bars -- one bullet and you're face down in the mud) and are busted back down to a machinegun, surviving a boss encounter can be a tricky thing.   The heroes also come factory standard with grappling guns that pull them up the screen. Look for an eagle emblem overhead when it's time to use the grappling gun and pull yourself out of trouble -- and, rather, into a different kind of trouble. The grappling gun lets Konami give the stages a vertical element which is a nice addition from past efforts loaded with strict side-scrolling.   If you're intimate with your phone's controls, you shouldn't have too much trouble getting into the rhythm of Contra 4. Konami sent me the game on an LG VX9400 (a very nice handset) but since I'm hardly an expert with the phone, I had to find my comfort zone.   The game looks great. I have only seen screenshots of the DS edition of Contra 4, and while Contra 4 isn't an exact duplicate, it certain is close enough to throw rocks. The characters are solidly animated, the backdrops are detailed with great color, and every moves along smoothly. Contra fans will instantly recognize that the game fits in the overall Contra aesthetic, if there is such a thing. It really is a handsome game.  Contra fans will really enjoy this new chapter for mobile. This is not some bastardized version of the game, shoved on to handsets to help market the DS game. This game was built with mobile in mind, such as the pacing of the enemies, and succeeds because it respects the limitations of the platform. Casual gamers will tear their hair out over the game's difficulty, but fans certainly know to expect this and will love the game for it. Give it a download. And then move away from crowded areas, because you will say some unsavory things.", "date": "Nov 20, 2007"}
