Luckily, Kemco's second N64 racer after last year's slick rally racer Top Gear Rally delivers the goods as far as arcade racers go, but a few annoying problems keep it from true greatness.Developed by N64-newcomer Snowblind, Top Gear Overdrive looks a lot like its predecessor -- but apart from the visual similarities Overdrive is a completely different game. As a matter of fact, Overdrive is a lot more like the original Top Gear games, meaning multiplayer races versus the computer, nitro boosts, and the ability to power up your car by winning money.The Facts Six tracks Championship Mode (1-4 players) Vs. Mode (1-4 players) 14 cars Color Shop (but no paint shop) Cash Points for buying new cars and upgrades Nitrous Boosts Lots of hidden shortcuts Music by Grindstone Rumble Pak support EEPROM (no memory pak required) Optional letterbox medium-res mode RAM Pak support for full-screen medium-res modeGameplay If you're expecting Top Gear Overdrive to play like Gran Turismo, then you're looking at the wrong game. The cars feel a lot less heavy than in most driving games and reach almost F-Zero-like speeds on the highest settings.Featuring a total of six courses with mostly street-based tracks, deadly hairpin turns and plenty of shortcuts, Overdrive focuses squarely on arcade racing. Players select from ten ~almost~ real vehicles (plus four hidden ones, like a Taco on tomato wheels or a Nintendo Power Concept Car) and compete not only for first place, but also cash points. Like in the original Top Gear games, the cash points can be picked up during the races and later on used to upgrade your equipment and even purchase new cars.Originally, Snowblind planned to include all-kinds of ways to cheat your opponent, such as turbo launch pads and oil slicks, but it seems that the designers have sadly dropped most of those intriguing extras during the development process. The only gadget that made it are the Nitrous Boosts which help you gain some extra speed. Still, cash points you pick up during the races play an important role. Using the extra money, you can enhance your car in the categories of handling, acceleration, top speed, and braking. The fastest (regular) car, the McLaren, with all attributes maxed out is so fast, you'll be hard-pressed to find any other street racing game with such intense speeds.Unfortunately, the game isn't without its problems. The control is a tad too loose, a fact that becomes painfully obvious when driving at high speeds. Although it's been tightened slightly over Rally's, steering is still much too touchy and you will definitely need a while to get used to it. Playing in the first person perspective helps greatly, but we can't help but wonder if a little more focus testing (or any focus testing at all?) couldn't have made this game handle a lot better. Steering wheel support? We couldn't find any, although it's really a must for a racing game of this caliber.Then there are a few other quibbles that keep the game from scoring higher -- and all seem to be related to features that could have been included if the design team could have spent a little more time on the game: No Time Trial Mode: Was this left out to avoid supporting the mem pak for record keeping? Sorry, but a TT mode is an important part of any racer. No Replay: The game's gorgeous graphics simply beg for a replay mode. There are third-person scenes of cars driving around in the attract mode, so this feature must have been at least planned. Horrible Vs. Mode selection: Instead of letting you select any track at any weather condition, you're limited to selecting tracks by season/round. After you finish racing, scores aren't kept and you're returned to the title screen. No Flips: Instead of having cars flip over when crashing, they simply burst into an ugly Rush-like fireball. Unfortunately, this happens a lot until you get used to the tracks. Length of game: The one-player mode is fun, but it's over far too quickly. Seasoned players can beat it in a weekend's time.On the positive side, the tracks are well-designed with many little short-cuts that are often covered by breakable barriers. The number of courses is a bit on the low side, but mirror tracks and different weather and daylight conditions keep players going. Frigid Peaks: a mountain track with ice cave shortcuts (complete with a mammoth, space ship and plesiosaur frozen into the ice). Fertile Canyon: race through corn fields and ascend into the narrow roads of a canyon with mine shafts and hairpin turns. Swampy Depot: a Florida-inspired swamp track with a house boat and plenty of jumps. Down Town: a city track with multiple routes. Looks a lot like Seattle. Sandy Beaches: a seaside track with shortcuts over the beach. Space Truckin': this intergalactic Autobahn bonus track is all about high speeds. No braking required.MultiplayerThis mode makes the game. Unlike most other racers in its class, Top Gear Overdrive offers a Championship mode not only for one player, but for a total of four. Even in the two-, three- and four-player modes, players will be able to compete against other computer-driven AI drivers and progress through the seasons together, building up their cars and buying new ones. Too bad there is only one save slot and no memory pak support, though. It would have been nice to start a season from scratch without having to sacrifice all the cars you earned.GraphicsThe vehicles and tracks in Top Gear Overdrive all feature the latest in graphical tricks and eye candy. Not only are the cars enhanced by realtime lighting and specular highlighting, they also come complete with real glass windows, meaning you can see the silhouette of the driver. The gorgeous lineup includes the following lookalikes (excluding the four secret fantasy cars): Volkswagen Beetle '98 Mitsubishi Eclipse Jeep Wrangler Chevrolet Camaro Dodge Viper Hummer Porsche 911 Ferrari F-40 Dodge Copperhead Concept Car McLaren F1The cool Paint Shop from TGR didn't make the cut, but at least Overdrive lets you change the car colors on the fly. Hey, it's your first (and hopefully only) chance to see a pink Viper... The tracks are beautifully laid out with plenty of roadside detail and interesting shortcuts (see above). The lighting effects are awesome. Especially the twilight races will have you stare at the beautiful sky textures in amazement and discovering some of the tracks' hidden surprises, such as the spaceship, is always good for a laugh. What a waste that there is no replay mode.Overdrive is also the first racing game to make use of Nintendo's RAM Expansion. When the upgrade is installed, gamers can enable a ~Full Hi-Res~ option in the menu. The increased resolution makes the graphics look even better (even though it's a medium-res mode, 640x240, not full 640x480 hi-res like QBC, T2 or Rogue Squadron). The game runs a tiny little bit slower in hi-res, but if you switch to first-person view, you won't notice a difference. For those without a RAM upgrade, Snowblind also included a neat little ~hi-res~ letterbox mode. Whichever resolution you choose, Overdrive is definitely the best-looking racer on the N64 yet.SoundLike Wipeout and EA's FIFA series, Overdrive relies on popular music with vocal tracks to supply the audio. Snowblind enlisted Grindstone to don six of their '80s-style Heavy Metal/Glam tracks, such as Hollow Eyes, Threshold, Appropriate, Mir, Everything, and Come Alive. Alas, the MPEG audio compression has left the music muffled and bass-less. It's a nice idea, but it sounds weak on any decent sound system. Sound effects are decent, but like Rally, they lack variety. One engine sound fits all.Overdrive is an outstanding multiplayer racer, but if you primarily play alone, you might want to stick to renting it. The track graphics and car models are fantastic and the sense of speed later in the game is out of this world, but I can't help but think the game was rushed out for a Christmas release. The lack of a Time Trial mode, replays and steering wheel support are probably enough to turn off die-hard racing fans. Anyone looking for a fun multiplayer racer in the style of the old Top Gears will find a lot to like. I still prefer Rally, mostly because of it's more realistic vehicle physics and longer-lasting one-player mode, but Overdrive is definitely a worthy successor, despite some annoying flaws. A good example of what's graphically possible on N64 if you have the right texture and 3D artists.", "date": "Dec 2, 1998"}
