Real big. Back in the late 70's and early 80's, Atari had the games that everybody else had to emulate.Times change, and following the videogame crash of the early 80's, Atari fell on hard times, and the rights to their games got bought up by Williams, their onetime rival. So when you stick the Atari Collection into your Saturn, you've gotta ask yourself, is Williams trying to make a quick buck off retrogaming fans, or does it think we'll truly appreciate this stuff?To a certain extent, both are true. While the games have dated badly, the treasure trove of interviews and historical perspective is invaluable.For today's gamer, the collection offers a mixed bag at best. While Centpiede and Missile Command show that some gameplay is timeless, others like Breakout or Battlezone have long been superseded by much snazzier version of themselves. Tempest, for one, has been outdone by Atari's own Tempest 2000. Much as some of us hate to admit it, a 15-second Breakout clip does not represent the epitome of gaming greatness.On the other hand, the rest of the disc is filled up with great video interviews and history of Atari. The interviews, done by Next Generation's Chris Charla, are a great resource for would-be game historians, as they provide insights to the thought of THE original game designers. However, if history isn't your thing, then most of the disc will be less than useful.Should you pick it up? The games are still good, but there are better ones out there. If you're into the classic scene this is a definite buy, but if not, then pass.", "date": "Jan 2, 1998"}
