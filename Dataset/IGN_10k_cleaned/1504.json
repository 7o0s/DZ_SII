There's nothing quite like the simple Zen-like nature that comes from this type of shooter, whether it's the ancient Atari classic, River Raid, or to more present day standards like Giga Wing.  Zipping between enemy fire, collecting power-ups, and bonus point items, it seems like an easy game.  I mean, all you have to do is shoot everything and dodge everything the game shoots at you.  And in this day and age, where video gamers are asking for more 3D visuals, for more complexity, and for more depth in their games, how can the classic vertically scrolling 2D shooter satisfy gamers these days?  Well, Psikyo, the seemingly last developer out there giving us 2D shooters anywhere, has been able to do it by offering precise controls, cool weapons, challenging gameplay, and, of course, the hard-to-find colorful 2D hand-drawn graphics.  And lucky Dreamcast owners can experience all of this in Psikyo's Gunbird 2.  Born in the arcades, Gunbird 2's Dreamcast translation is, as far as I can see, flawless.  With various view modes for play including Arcade mode where you can the flip your screen horizontally so it perfectly matches the dimensions of your television.  This is, what shooter maniacs call, the ~real way~ to play the game though this also involves either turning your television on its side or the player developing a chronic case of ~Taco Neck.~  The game is a visual candy treat, if you like your candy flavored in 2D.  Wonderful hand-drawn character portraits, humorous background designs, and a palette of happy colors certainly makes this game look deceivingly cute.  And with a cast of characters ranging from a teenage witch wielding her slapstick rabbit, a scientist's daughter complete with huge glasses and a photon ripple gun, and a rotund Arabian sultan on a magic carpet, this game oozes ~cuteness.~  Add into the delightful visuals, happy-go-lucky melodies that rival the sweetness of Sailor Moon, and it's easy to call this title ~just for kids~.  And then you play the game and at first, it seems pretty easy on the first level.  Of course, this is how the game hooks you in, and by the third level, you'll be sweating frantically from all the reflex dodging, button mashing, and quick-decision making.  The game follows your typical shooter format - shoot everything that kills and don't get hit.  You can sometimes survive a collision with enemy vehicles, but beyond that exception, even the smallest bullet will bring you down.  When it comes to your firepower, you'll have to build it up by playing ~chasing the power-up~ where you can build it up to three levels  grabbing anymore power-ups beyond that will only give you bonus points.  To give you additional firepower, you have to other offensive weapons: charge shot and vicinity attack.  Both can only be activated if you have enough energy in your Power Gauge displayed at the bottom of the screen.  The charge shot is an automatic firing weapon that drains the Power Gauge, increasing in damage depending how far you've charged your Power Gauge. The vicinity attack is a powerful, close range attack that doesn't increase in damage if your Power Gauge is full, but unlike the charge shot, you can use the vicinity attack up to three times if your meter is full.  And you also have the all powerful super bomb that will bail you out in those ~panic situations~.    Now the most obvious flaw for any classic shooting game like Gunbird 2 is replay value, especially since this game was ported from the arcade.  Other than playing to improve your score and having a friend who wants to play with you, Gunbird 2's replay value is definitely on the short side.  And before I forget, the game also sports a cool Gallery mode where you can view character artwork (mmmm... Morrigan.... woof).  So, Gunbird 2 is low on replay value and additional options... why the heck would you play this game?  Well, if you ever have only a few minutes to spare Gunbird 2 is a simple to pick-up game that will satisfy the urge to blow up stuff.  But I hope that most of you that decide to get Gunbird 2 are those that know the excitement of weaving between enemy fire, appreciate 2D artistry, and respect classic gameplay that never gets old.  If that's you, you'll definitely be satisfied.  --Anthony ~Da 'Bomb~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 21, 2000"}
