And the Game Boy isn't a stranger to that title, as last year saw the release of Majesco's (rather bad) rendition of Super Breakout. But Crave has its own, unofficial remake of the classic in the form of Dragon Dance. This game doesn't offer much more than what's already been done to the design in the past, but at least it's a lot more enjoyable than the ~official~ version of Breakout released last year. Features 100 levels Password save Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Okay, so you might not know what Breakout is -- so here's the deal: a set of bricks line the upper half of the screen, and it's up to you to keep a ball bouncing up into the bricks. Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and the ball changes direction -- and you keep the ball alive by moving a paddle across the bottom of the playing field. Dragon Dance is exactly that -- with a few new elements thrown into the mix to make it its own game. Your paddle is an curled-up dragon that elongates when you move him left and right -- when sitting still he bunches right back up into a cute ball. If the ball drops past the dragon, he shrinks -- and if the dragon shrinks to nothing, the game's over. Above the dragon, some blocks offer powerups that, when caught, increase the dragon's power -- like a faster speed or size recovery. And as you eliminate blocks, a power gauge at the top of the screen increases to give your dragon special abilities that'll change the pace of the game -- in one form you can deflect the ball in mid-flight. In another, you can breathe fire to wipe out blocks without the use of the ball. Dragon Dance is broken down into one hundred different brick layouts -- some of which have very ingenious designs to make clearing them very, very tough. Many levels have been created to give you a challenge in hitting the ball at different angles  and since the game is time-based, you have to do it quickly. It's not just a matter of keeping the ball alive any more -- it's about doing it before time runs out. And that's a major challenge right there for many levels. At least you have control over the ball's speed -- hitting the select button will increase the pace of the ball. But there's a downside -- you can only increase the speed...not decrease. The speed will automatically reset to the first setting when you drop the ball.  The designers even threw in a link mode for two players that works similar to Tetris' two player option -- in this game, each player is working on his own screen. Every five seconds, whoever knocked out the least bricks in that five seconds gets an additional row of blocks added to the stack. Whoever clears out their stack first wins, and whoever loses the ball four times loses. This mode is a simple Vs. option, but it adds that much more to the game's already excellent replay value.  The only bad thing I can say about Dragon Dance is its bland graphics. There's absolutely no style whatsoever -- no sense of depth or detail. I'm no artist but even I could have done better with the graphic elements of Dragon Dance than the developers had. The only positive is the effect of the dragon curling and elongating as you move the paddle left and right.  As a Breakout clone goes, Dragon Dance is a really good one -- it's not that much more than Taito's Arkanoid, but for the Game Boy Color it's a much better option than Majesco's ~official~ Super Breakout. 100 levels (including boss levels) will last you a long time -- in my first two hours I only got through twenty of them. I do wish there was an option to create your own layouts, but since the game lacks a battery it wouldn't make sense in the design. The game isn't a new concept, sure, but Breakout's always going to be a classic -- and Dragon Dance is a fun version of it.", "date": "Sep 13, 2000"}
