Games have jumped from 2D to 3D and the graphic and audio presentations have seen similar revolutions. The classics  -- your Jousts and Dig-Dugs and everything in between -- look downright ancient by comparison to today's technically advanced offerings. But you know, those dusty old titles are still fun to pick up and play, which is a true testament to their design. Perhaps realizing this, Midway has taken a look to the past as inspiration for some of its next-generation products. It has recently unleashed vastly updated sequels to the Gauntlet franchise across multiple platforms and, thank your lucky stars, now comes a 3D remake of the beloved action-racer SpyHunter.  Now is of course relative as PlayStation 2 owners got this same SpyHunter sequel last September. It was originally developed by Paradigm Entertainment, the same group that brought the wacky, but lovable Beetle Adventure Racing to N64 a couple of years back. The GameCube port remains identical in mechanics to its predecessor, featuring 14 missions of fast and furious gun and jump-centric action. It's a lot of fun and indeed some of the mission objectives are downright old school in difficulty, which is very satisfying. What is disappointing, however, is that the GCN port -- obviously rushed -- boasts no graphic or audio improvements, lacks some of the new extra features of the Xbox incarnation, and actually runs with a worse framerate fluidity than its PS2 forefather.  The Facts  14 different worldwide missions, including Venice, England and Key West The G-6155 Interceptor car, which can morph into a speedboat, a turbo jet watercraft or a super cycle Photo-realistic graphics and recognizable landmarks 3-D, behind the vehicle perspective Two remakes of the SpyHunter ~Peter Gunn~ theme song by Island Gold recording group Saliva All the old-school weapons including machine guns, smoke screens and oil slicks New weapons including missiles, flame throwers and classified equipment The classic Weapons Van, which the player can enter to upgrade weaponry Two-player mode   Gameplay Damn those elite groups of eccentric rich businessmen. When will they ever learn? This time, the wealthy old coots have banded together to create their own little club, Nostra, which seeks to control the entire planet by knocking out all of the electricity. It's just crazy enough to work... in a videogame. Of course, it's up to players, armed with the G-6155 Interceptor car's unique ability to transform into a speedboat or motorcycle, and overflowing with artillery, to stop the Nostra before it can execute its evil deeds. And so begins the racing adventure.  What all of this really boils down to are 14 missions of vehicular racing and on-the-fly combat -- all skinned over the backbone of the classic SpyHunter design. Each of the 14 missions feature in-level objectives -- several per area and some more difficult than others depending on the particular stage. In the first stage, for example, players must do everything from avoid killing innocent civilians to clearing a 50-meter jump, shooting down a series of targets and successfully navigating a batch of markers. Later levels have gamers hooting down enemy copters, traveling underground to destroy satellites and more. It's possible to advance to the next stage after only completing a handful of the goals, but as levels progress the missed objectives begin to build up and gamers will eventually have to tackle them to gain access to the advanced stages. It's a very well designed setup that enables the novice gamer a sneak-peek at stages to come and simultaneously challenges them to complete the objectives before advancing beyond a set point.  SpyHunter is a lot of fun. The original development studio did a remarkable job of recreating the franchise in 3D. Control is tight, enabling gamers to quickly slide around corners without losing an inch, to navigate jumps and catch big air, or to seamlessly shift into boat or motorcycle form, all while targeting enemies and destroying assigned objects. Players have an unlimited amount of machine gun fire, which comes in handy when taking down enemy after enemy -- and believe us, there are sometimes swarms of foes to worry about while racing. But there is a bit more strategy injected into the gameplay process too as there are other weapons, from EMPs that knock out bombs to a flame-thrower, that can be picked up during the course of the adventure, and all of these extras do have a time and a place. Paradigm has also succeeded in delivering a clear sense of unique control, physics and usability for the different forms of vehicles available. Straight out street driving is very obviously heavier than the motorcycle areas, while the speedboat is more bouncy and offers more drift upon the water.   This all comes together quite triumphantly for an experience that is both very well balanced and equally challenging. From morphing into a speedboat and blasting through water to shooting down motorcycle bandits or engaging with the repair truck -- it just feels like SpyHunter, which is a considerable accomplishment given that the franchise has moved into 3D. The downside is technical -- the fluidity of the game sometimes stutters to a point where it really, truly becomes difficult to navigate precise areas, and that's thoroughly frustrating. But we'll get to that in a moment.     The two-player mode enables players to race through the levels that have been totally completed successfully. If even one objective has been missed on a level, it will remain unlocked in the multiplayer mode. This is both good and bad. It's good because it forces gamers to really play the single-player mode before they dive immediately into the multiplayer one, and it also gives do-gooders something to ~shoot~ for, so to speak. But on the other hand, we like to think of a multiplayer mode in these types of games as a standard feature, not something that must be worked toward. Given that some of the later levels are extremely difficult, and that getting every objective in every level is tough, we expect that not many will be able to fully enjoy the multiplayer additions without the help of an online cheat guide.  Disappointing -- Midway has apparently decided that GameCube owners don't care about extras such as being able to play the original arcade SpyHunter, or being able to view DVD-like extras. Xbox owners meanwhile get to enjoy these additions. Considering all of the extras packed into a GCN title like Rogue Leader and that SpyHunter for PS2 fit quite easily on a CD, we're baffled. Money talks, we guess.  Graphics When SpyHunter released for PlayStation 2 last September it was not considered a beautiful game. Sister-site IGNPS2 in fact described the visuals as ~average.~ This is true of the GCN version too. The title takes players through large enough 3D environments constructed with a moderate amount of polygons, the texture work is acceptable but not overly impressive, there are particle effects, reflection maps, transparencies, and the other standards. A respectable amount of enemies and objects appear on-screen at once, from giant structures with guards to moving vehicles, and perhaps this is the title's biggest graphic feat. With that, some of the in-game cut-scenes are also nicely done, particularly that of the morphing vehicle -- it hangs in mid-air while the camera circles bullet-time style. But this is no visual masterpiece.  Unfortunately, a noticeable lack of filtering in the PS2 version has remained intact for the racer's GameCube transition, which is almost inexcusable given the delay in porting the title and the fact that Nintendo's hardware is more than capable of correcting this issue, and easily. What's worse, though, is that the framerate has actually dropped with the port -- the GameCube version runs slower than its Sony-branded counterpart and with less predictability. That's just poor. The end result is a sometimes jumpy framerate that is barely ever truly smooth and uninterrupted for more than a few seconds -- quite a problem for a racer that requires a clear sense of speed, and annoying bearing the decidedly lackluster visuals in mind. Sloppy -- very sloppy.  Sound Midway has done a solid job of recreating the mood and atmosphere of the SpyHunter franchise, particularly so far as audio is concerned. The title features various cuts of the classic SpyHunter music, one of which is performed by rock band Saliva -- all of them sharp and polished. A standard mix of sound effects completes the tunes, from the rattling of machine gun fire to tire screeches, explosive bangs, crashes and more. All in all, not a bad listening experience, so long as you don't grow tired of the various renditions of the Peter Gunn theme.SpyHunter is satisfyingly challenging vehicular racer and combat game. Developer Paradigm Entertainment did a fine job of recreating the franchise in 3D complete with tight controls, lots of mission variety, difficult objectives, lots of weapons and the ability to morph into different vehicles in different situations, and more. There's even a two-player mode thrown in for added benefit, albeit hard to access if one's unwilling to devote some serious time and energy to the single-player mode first.There's bad, though -- the GameCube port of SpyHunter is not only far inferior to the Xbox version, which runs better and features several exclusive additions, it actually displays a worsened framerate over the original PS2 version which shipped six months ago. The fluidity chops up consistently and it is even occasionally difficult to center one's car in the right direction because of it. This kind of sloppiness is unforgivable.At the end of the day, this is still a fun, if not addictive racer that comes recommended despite its technical shortcomings. But if one owns either a PS2 or Xbox, don't bother with this inferior version.", "date": "Mar 13, 2002"}
