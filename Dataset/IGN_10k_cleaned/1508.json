The entire gang of Rugrats is back for an adventure in the land of France, and just in time for their latest major motion picture of the same name. While IGN64 will certainly not admit to having seen this movie yet (or ever), the 64-bit interactive version of the flick no doubt follows the plot as the goofy kids run amuck in a French theme park in search of the ~Reptar control helmet.~ And why would you want that? For controlling Reptar of course -- a gigantic lizard robot of destruction.  We'll just warn you up front -- if you're over the age of 12 and are not a fan of the Rugrats shows or movies, then you can stop reading right now. This game has been targeted directly for the youngsters in the crowd with very little appealing to the older gamers. But perhaps if you're looking to snag a gift for that little tyke with a thing for the Rugrats, then keep reading to see if this title will slap a smile on their diaper-loving faces.  The Facts  One to four players alternating Choose to play as one of six different Rugrats characters: Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Angelica, and Kimi An all new story based on ~Rugrats in Paris: The Movie~ launching November 2000 A completely new 3-D world designed from actual movie stills Ten mini-games, plus puzzles, prizes, and hidden bonus games Authentic music, sounds, and character voices the official Rugrats hit TV cartoons and movies Save game progress via Controller Pak Rumble Pak support  Gameplay Aside from the license of wacky diaper critters, it's quite obvious that developer Avalanche Software has geared this title directly toward the kids in the gameplay department. The presentation is appropriately cute, fun, and bursting with that loveable Rugrats appeal. But once you grab a controller, you can't help but realize exactly how simplified the gameplay has been made to help keep the kids interested. This is not a 3D platforming title -- it's much more similar to the Mario Party games really. Gameplay revolves around completing various mini-game events to earn enough tickets to beat the game, and as such it is really very straightforward, simple, yet fun on a very basic level.  Players begin the game by selecting one of five difficulty levels ranging from ~very easy~ to ~very hard.~ Then you must choose your favorite Rugrats personality out the six featured characters for controlling during this little romp. The choice doesn't seem to impact the gameplay whatsoever as each character moves and interacts the exact same; the only noticeable difference between each Rugrat is in the random comments they make during the action such as, ~Gah ha! This is fun!~ Oh yes, we're sure it is, little Chuckie. The reason these twerps are having so much fun is because they are somehow running wild and free in the middle of a completely deserted French theme park. I mean really, you'd probably be having fun too.  The only characters you'll find in this park are the occasional remaining Rugrats standing in various corners of the map. Otherwise, gameplay basically comes down to running completely uninhibited throughout one of five different areas of the park and collecting tickets to buy things from the prize center. That's basically the entire objective of the game -- collect and earn enough tickets to buy the Reptar control helmet. Most tickets are just sitting in plain sight and scattered all over the park. You'll spend your time just wandering around and scooping them up, and depending on the difficulty level you will eventually grab enough to buy some prizes -- the harder the setting, the more tickets you'll need.  Wandering the park will be a bit tedious for experienced gamers due to a very sluggish control scheme. You really feel like the little suckers are running on the ocean floor or moon surface due to the rather slow and heavy moving feel they've been given. But for younger gamers, this will probably be to their advantage by allowing them to slowly guide their character from point A to point B and without continually bouncing into walls. Another reason for the slowdown is the chunking framerate that never once flows remotely smooth. Again, younger gamers probably will be too wrapped up in the Rugrats action to notice or let it interfere with their silly fun, but other gamers will find it somewhat distracting. It works only because this game never features any fast onscreen action that would suffer because of it.  Part of the framerate issue can also be attributed to the camera system. Again, the developer has decided to simplify the gaming experience for the youngsters by fixing the camera angle very low and always directly behind the character. This allows the gamer to always have a forward view of the action, unlike most 3D character-based titles where the gamer must learn to visualize their bearing in relation to the environment and move the control stick accordingly. It's a great idea for simplifying the gameplay, but the extremely low and constantly rotating camera angle drops the framerate to a crawl in return. Again, the game still plays fine, but it's rather annoying if you're at all accustomed to controlling other smoother N64 games.  But the fun part of Rugrats in Paris really isn't lumbering through the park collecting tickets -- it's the mini-games that players will enjoy the most. There are ten basic games (and various other hidden ones) such as a baseball toss, bumper cars, skee-ball, and ~Chuckie Chan,~ where players can send that little carrot-top goofball flip-kicking wooden planks into pieces. The ~Whack-a-ninja~ game is very simple and equally fun without the moles, but the best mini-game has to be the ~mini golf.~ THQ could probably release an entire Rugrats game devoted to this one if they beefed it up with more courses. Players are free to run all over the current hole they're playing to investigate the terrain, and then line up their shot and power meters to send the ball down the course. Every hole features a creative and stylish design with all the standard tricks and moving obstacles you'd expect to find. It's simple, fun, and younger gamers will eat this one up, but remember -- most of these games are simply not amusing at all unless you are either in love with the Rugrats or are under the age of 12.  Most of the mini-games can also be played in a multiplayer mode, but really all this does is cut out the pointless wandering of the theme park and lets up to four players compete in the mini-games. Sounds great, but there's no split-screen action here -- each player takes a turn racking up a score in the given contest, and the top score wins. It would have been nice to have some four-player bumper cars, but the framerate probably would have been pretty bad anyway.  Graphics The Rugrats eye-candy is actually well above average -- not the greatest, but the game does feature some decent visuals nonetheless. It sticks with the style of the cartoons, and the transition to 3D has been a bit better this time than the previous N64 title, Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt. The previously mentioned low camera angle allows gamers to see well off into the distance, and Avalanche Software has managed to do this without any fogging or draw-in whatsoever. Granted the framerate chokes because of it, but given the targeted age group for this title, the graphical quality and framerate problems probably won't matter anyway. The Rugrats fans who end up getting this game will have nothing to complain about in terms of graphics, but nothing really to brag about either.  Sound If you can manage to enjoy an entire episode of the Rugrats gang and their obnoxiously cute chatter, then the constant giggles, squeaks, and colorful commentary in this game will probably thrill you to pieces. Factor 5's increasingly popular N64 sound compression routine, Musyx, has been used to deliver all the same great music, effects, and voice samples from the show in great clarity and offering a real treat for the ears -- if you're into that sort of thing anyway. This is one area that gamers will take notice and appreciate for sure. Half the fun of any cartoon-based license is having your favorite characters come to life as you control them, and the great use of sound in Rugrats in Paris does exactly that. The entire gang comes to life with lots of random one-liners as they walk around the park collecting tickets and competing in the mini-games. The music is very bouncy like good circus tunes should be, and there are even some good background and environment sounds showing up in the right places. Again, like the graphics, if a gamer is into Rugrats, then they certainly won't have anything to complain about with the audio in this game. If not, however, then it could possibly have the reverse, undesired effect of driving you out of your mind. Either is fine by us.The game is simple, short, unbearably cute, and suffers from a severe case of sluggish controls and a bad framerate. That's enough for me to toss it in the dirty diaper pail right there. But considering that I'm about 15 to 20 years older than the target gamer for Rugrats in Paris, I can say with confidence that many such kids and fans of the show will have a barrel of fun with this title. They'll see right through all of its technical problems and enjoy the familiar faces and sounds, easy games, and straightforward play control. If you happen to have such a kid on your shopping list, then consider giving this one a rent or buy depending on how fanatical they are about Rugrats. Otherwise, this game is really not worth the price of admission. If you're looking for a good mini-game title with a more general appeal, then Nintendo's Mario Party 2 will by far be your best choice. Just don't tell Chuckie we said that.", "date": "Nov 21, 2000"}
