Sports that didn't get much mainstream exposure were right at home on the fledgling network. Lately, it's turned into nothing more than a more in-depth version of ESPN, and the lineup of hard-to-find sports has gone with it. That's depressing, because I pretty much kept myself occupied in college by either playing videogames or watching inline hockey, pool tournaments and indoor lacrosse on ~The Deuce.~   Imagine my surprise, then, when I saw Blast Lacrosse on PlayStation's release list. Talk about worlds colliding! I was at the same time amazed, exciting and horrified. Amazed because I didn't think anyone would have the stones to release such a niche title. Excited because, c'mon, it's a lacrosse videogame...how cool is that? And horrified, because niche sports titles have never really been done well. Need I bring up Kurt Warner's Arena Football game? Ouch. Turns out I was right to have mixed emotions going in. The end product produced amazement, excitement and, yes, a bit of horror.  Developed by Sandbox Studios and published by Acclaim Sports, it is the world's first lacrosse videogame. It's got a lot going for it, including fast-paced action, great commentary and a lot of play modes. Unfortunately, it isn't much to look at, which can make seeing what's happening on the field rather difficult. But, as niche sports titles go, this one is quirky and fun, despite its shortcomings.  Presentation The presentation of Blast Lacrosse is as simple as it gets, and that's not a bad thing. This game is arcade-style 5-on-5 lacrosse with a simple object, simple controls and a no-frills interface. The front-end is a lot like the original NFL Blitz on PlayStation. There are several modes of play, including Arcade, Tournament, Season, Exhibition, and Sudden Death. I was actually quite surprised at the number of different choices here. The Season mode was a nice bonus, even though it is the most rudimentary season mode I have ever seen. There is no individual stat tracking, no standings screen and no trade feature. It's just a bunch of games in a row.   Blast Lacrosse is based on the National Lacrosse League, an indoor league with mostly East Coast teams. All nine NLL teams are represented here, with names like the Columbus Landsharks, Ottawa Rebel, and Washington Power. All of the rosters are official, so if you follow the sport somehow (and I don't know how, unless you live in an NLL franchise city), you'll be thrilled. All of the home fields are represented here as well, although customization of arenas basically consisted of changing the logo at the center of the field.  Graphics From the first time I saw screens of the game, I knew it wasn't going to win any visual awards. The player models look decidedly first generation, the arenas are nothing much to look at and the animations are choppy at best. Add to this a persistent flicker, and you've got some serious graphical issues. But this game is more about gameplay than anything. It has to be.  I could just be spoiled by some of the recent sports titles on the PS, but the players in this game seem over-polygonal. There is no real detail on the flat surfaces of their bodies either. Uniforms seem to be made of about four polygons total. If your team score three goals in a row, the player with the ball (and the ball itself) become ~on fire.~ The fire effects are awful. The on-fire player turns into a large orange blob that just barely resembles fire. Perhaps it would have been better if the fire animation moved faster, but it doesn't.  In fact, all the animations are basic. Each one appears to only use about three or four frames, which gives the game a ~flickery~ effect. For awhile I couldn't decide whether it slowed down or not, and I finally I came to the conclusion that the animations were just so underdeveloped they made things look choppy when they weren't.  Sound Where Blast Lacrosse sets itself apart from anything in your collection is the color commentary. Voiced by gravelly-voiced national sports talk radio host Scott Farrell, it is a constant barrage of machine-gun one-liners; a garbled, snarled slew of phrases that will make you giggle all game long. This is the kind of gobbledygook he spews nonstop: ~Don't bother getting up, just lay there with your tongue hanging out,~ and ~Smash him into the boards in the name of love.~ But that's not even his best stuff. His timing is hilarious and you don't even get sick of hearing the same phrases over and over, because they're funny as hell. Not only that, but you'll find yourself repeating these things in your everyday life. At least I did. You can choose to listen to music rather than the commentary during gameplay, but why would you want to?  The rest of the sounds in the game are sparse and unvaried. The commentary by itself gets a 10. The other sounds earn a 3.  Gameplay Blast Lacrosse is simple to pick up and tough to put down. The controls are very easy to grasp. You'll be lobbing and checking within seconds of popping the disc in. And the gameplay is pretty addictive if you can get past the graphics.  Blast Lacrosse is like a hybrid of early EA hockey and NFL Blitz. Lacrosse, of course, is played with wooden sticks. Each has a basket on its end. Players pass the ball around, catching the ball in their nets and using the stick to shoot at a net. The net is set up much like hockey, and the flow of the game is similar as well. You can run with the ball or pass it aggressively and check at will.  Checking is a huge part of this game and is handled well for the most part. There's nothing quite as fulfilling as laying your friend out as he's charging on goal. The only problem with it is that players tend to stay on the turf quite a while. If you're facing a particularly good checking team, your entire crew can be on the tarmac at the same time, with only your goalie standing his ground. Of course, this can work to your advantage as well, but there's something empty about scoring when everyone on the other team is laying down.  When passing, you have a choice between a fast strike or a lazy lob to your mate. The controls for passing are pretty responsive, which is good, as it plays a huge role in setting up scoring. The one-timer is huge in this game, and for that, you need accurate pass controls.  Shooting can be problematic, though. This is primarily because the graphics are shabby. Although the game allows you to pick where you're aiming at the net, it is often hard to see whats going on near the goal, due in large part to the choppy animation.   But even with some minor control difficulties and major graphics issues, Blast Lacrosse has that intangible fun factor that makes me happy it's in my collection. My buddy was visiting from out of town and we sat down to play a couple of games. That stretched into five or six, as we kept calling rematch after rematch. That was unexpected, but nice. It's just that when the ball gets zipping around, all kinds of crazy things can happen. Like erasing a 5-goal lead in the fourth quarter, or scoring from half-field, or staying on fire for eight goals. It's all about the joy of playing, and Blast Lacrosse delivers on that front.", "date": "Jun 8, 2001"}
