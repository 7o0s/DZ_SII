{"name": "Forsaken", "name_review": "Forsaken", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/07/14/forsaken-2", "text": "Usually when Acclaim sends IGN a game later than the scheduled release date, it's an instant message that takes a special journalistic decoder, the mighty ~Sh*t Detector.~ After revving up the high-rech tinker-toy-taped-to-a-ruler-glued-to-a-lincoln-log up and applying it to Forsaken, we realized Acclaim had made a mistake; our code read much like we had suspected:  The PlayStation Forsaken doesn't suck. It was late for some other stange reason.  In fact, as long as you can handle turning over in circles and blasting the gears out of flying pods and droids, well, you'll really like the game.   Now, mind you, there are two other versions of Forsaken, one on PC and the other on Nintendo 64. So, you must be wondering which is better? We prefer the Nintendo 64 version, which is an unfortunate thing for us to admit, but it's what we would put our money on. And yes, the PC version is really rather gorgeous as well, and many people find that the preferable one.  The PlayStation version, however, is by no means a pushover. In fact, it's a highly recommended title, especially since there is almost nothing much like it on PlayStation.   The story, an elaborate sci-fi tale of technological discover gone wrong followed by merciless space pirates pillaging the earth's remains, really has nothing to do with the fast-action maneuvering, weapon-management, and craft skill you'll apply to make your way through this fantastic corridor roller coaster.   Those three aforementioned aspects are the keys to your survival. Fast-action maneuvering means that you really need to stay moving. Ships in all areas are after your butt, and learning the ability to strafe in 3D is a key skill. Weapon management is important because weapons aren't laid out like hookers in the Red Light district. No, pal. You'll need to find them, remember where they are, and occasionally go back when you run out. It's not like your primary weapons are that powerful. Third, learning how to control your ship isn't a simple minute-long experience. You'll need to understand that most of your PSX controller buttons are necessary to use. The analog controls are also useable, but strangely enough, I preferred the digital controls.  With 15 bikes and 12 weapons and a spinning, free-style ioncycle that contains standout maneuverability, you're in for a serious ride. All in all,  there are 15 single-player levels to explore in all. Not to be forgotten are the blast-o-rama multiplayer levels. This is where you'll get most of your replay value from -- battling against a friend in a flurry of shots and flashes. The multiplayer mode also enables matches with a selection of max kills or a max time limit. Dive into this mode for immediate satisfaction.  Forsaken looks great. It's full of interesting textures and lava, glowing missiles, wild explosions, etc. one particularly annoying enemy disappears and reappears at will anywhere on the site -- what a bitch! The point is that the effect is just short of jaw dropping.   What's far nice that the Nintendo 64 version is the music. It's a mixture of looping techno and ambient genres -- and it's loud, clear, and not surprisingly, appropriate. Yar.  In the end, Forsaken really should stand out more than it has on the PlayStation, and for some strange reason, it's been a game that's received good but spare comment. The fact that so many PlayStation title come out each week and the game genre -- 3D space corridor shooter -- places it smack amongst millions of other similar titles may have something (oh, just possibly) to do with it.
