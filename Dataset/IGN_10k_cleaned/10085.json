After so many quality episodes, we really can't be surprised that this latest sees the quality dip a bit, particularly in terms of story and humor. The real shame here is that the slip comes at a point when the targets seem the most rich -- zombies, rave culture, and Euro poseurs are all ripe for the skewering satire that we've seen the team deliver to politics, internet and television -- but in the end, Night of the Raving Dead falls short of what we've come to expect from the deranged duo.  But first things first. This episode begins in the middle, with Sam and Max caught in the deadly clutches of a laughable emo European vampire. The whole first half of the episode sparks off as Sam recalls the events that led them into such a predicament. It's a great storytelling device that instantly ratchets up the tension, and manages to pay off with one of the series' best jokes so far once Sam realizes that the story has caught up with the present.    There are some great running gags in this episode and plenty of opportunity for the writers to skewer lots of topics, from the success of terrible American TV shows in Germany to the horrid nature of Goth poetry. One of the best gags, though, focuses on everyone's misunderstanding of just what a ~zombie factory~ is -- Is it a factory that makes zombies? A place where zombies work? Or perhaps a factory that is, itself, undead? The possibilities are hilarious, and all funnier than the actual reality.   Ultimately though, the writers just haven't done as much with this material as they have in past episodes. And it's a real shame because the whole Euro-scene, product placement and zombies are all ripe for satire. Instead, it seems like they're content to recycle a few, admittedly hilarious, gags from Young Frankenstein and then call it a day.  Bosco's gone from this episode but we get a lot more time with Sybil. She's taken the breakup kind of hard and has decided to start looking for love again by starting her own personal dating service. Her suitors are all players in previous episodes, so it's nice to see them have a chance to shine again here. Even our old friend Superball (cue thunder and horse whinny) makes a return here, as does Sam and Max's hard-boiled, hard-bitten neighbor Flint Paper. The COPS are also back, but something seriously unfunny has happened to Bluster Blaster, who was quickly becoming our favorite character in the entire series.    We always wish that these episodes had more of Abe Lincoln in them, so it was a bit of a downer that he didn't get much screen time. Our grief, however, was lessened by the appearance the nearly-as-funny zombie Lincoln, who is still trying to figure out how the play is going to end. The new emo vampire Jurgen has some great dialogue as well and is acted brilliantly but we kept wishing that the rest of the game lived up to his performance.      The puzzles are still on the right track, thankfully, with plenty of the A to B to C thinking that the series is starting to embrace. Trying to figure out the multi-part solution to accessing Jurgen's secret lair is one of the game's more intense challenges, but it's hardly the only brain scratcher you'll encounter.  We had a heck of a time, for instance, figuring out just what needed to be done with the hand in Stinky's.  The driving mini-game seems to offer a little more variety this time around, focusing on a Paperboy-like distribution of SOL discs. But instead of actually requiring any level of skill from the player, the game just rewards constant mashing of the fire button. We passed it in a handful of seconds and could easily have still accomplished it without even looking at the screen. It's not that we expect Mario-style jump puzzles or something, but if you're going to implement a mini-game, at least give the player room to succeed or fail based on their own involvement.    Visually, the game hits all the right spots. The zombies are just cartoony enough to work in the Sam and Max world, but disturbing enough to really evoke a sense of unease. Things get even more disturbing after the duo's experience in Jurgen's death trap, but we don't want to give all that away just yet. The new main characters of Jurgen and his monster are well designed and hopefully won't just be limited to this episode. The atmospheric effects outside of the castle are particularly effective as well.  The sounds are also amazing. I particularly like the gloomy soundtrack and the way that the effects are used in the castle exterior. And though you can hear the Bluecher gag coming from a mile down the road, it's still delivered very well, thanks solely to the excellent sound design. Voice acting is also well done, especially in the case of the femme-tastic Jurgen and his surprisingly articulate creation.    Night of the Raving Dead is definitely one of the weaker episodes in the series history, but at least it's better than last year's episode 3 slump. The problem there was that the puzzles were awful. In this case, the puzzles are just fine, but the gags just aren't as funny or as frequent as we've come to expect from the series. Sure, it's got some new great characters and definitely makes an effort to make it all part of a larger story, but in the end, it's just not as enjoyable as it ought to be.", "date": "Feb 27, 2008"}
