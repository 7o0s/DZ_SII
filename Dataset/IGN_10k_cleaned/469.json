Sure, chills run up and down my spine whenever I'm forced to play something as stinky as Soul Fighter, but there have been few titles that make you really uncomfortable. I'm talking about the same feeling you got the first time you saw A Clockwork Orange. And I'm pleased to say that the latest creation from Atlus, Maken X, is a 100% unsettling descent into the world of the occult, and most importantly, ass-kicking gameplay.  You begin playing the game as Kei Kanazawa, a mild schoolgirl-type who shows up at her father's research lab for a friendly visit. It seems that daddy dearest is attempting to awaken an incredibly demonic sword called the Maken. With vaguely human features that are merged together like a genetic experiment gone wrong, the remains of the Maken is a slimy chunk of organic matter that really shouldn't be messed with. And as one of the researchers attempts to reconstruct the sword, something goes terribly, terribly wrong.   Without warning, the lab doors burst open to reveal a creature vaguely resembling a human, dressed in a circa-1940s Soviet soldier's outfit. Its metallic face splits open to produce an human tongue, which begins shooting blades into everyone it sees. Your father is kidnapped in the ensuing slaughter, and the poor schmuck attempting to rebuild the sword serves as a human shield for your sorry ass. The newly-completed Maken is in front of you, and you've got to get your father back. We think you know what's going to happen next.   Though it looks like a first-person shooter at first glance, there's not that much shooting in Maken X. Instead, the game concentrates on first-person slashing, and almost all the combat is up-close and personal. It's best described as a first-person rendition of Zelda 64's combat, and it works unbelievably well. When you sight an enemy, tap the Y button to lock on to them  it brings up a targeting reticule that displays their health. From here on in, you can strafe around your opponent, jump in and out with attacks, or use my favorite approach  vaulting over their heads and letting 'em have it on the way back down, just like Mitsurugi in Soul Calibur. Stabbing enemies in their backs registers as a critical hit, but you'll need to strike fast before they whip around with another attack. Blocking is performed by yanking back on the analog stick, and will protect you from most enemy weapon deluges. Weapons can also be charged by holding down the attack button, with the results being explosive range attacks.   The levels, while extremely linear, keep the action coming and aim the player in the right direction. Though there are a few jumping puzzles that suffer from the first-person perspective (didn't we learn our lesson with Turok?), the majority of the gameplay is of the kill-the-enemy, find-the-switch variety. In some of the stages, you'll need to use some creative strategy to lure enemies into certain locations, with literally killer results.   There are also in-game cutscenes aplenty, all of which are generated in real-time. The majority of these look fantastic, and show off some excellent character modeling. The only graphical niggle is that the characters' mouths don't move most of the time  we'll expect that in the sequel, I suppose. Sometimes, Maken X relies on black-and-white still sequences to advance the plot, which occasionally go a bit long, but do a decent job of filling you in on what's going on.   After you catch up with your father's assailant in the first stage, the game takes an interesting twist  via the power of the Maken, you have the ability to ~brain-jack,~ or jump into the body of another character. For example, after the first boss fight, you have the ability to possess the Soviet cyborg, and start playing the rest of the game as him. On your way, you'll run into characters who you may, or may not, want to brain-jack  the chubby security guard on the jumbo jet is barely playable, but the blade-wielding Chinese babe who you meet in the middle of Hong Kong is much more effective. Each character has stats for attack power, speed, and jumping, and as you get deeper in the game, you run into more powerful allies.   And it's a good thing you've got a full roster of bad-asses under your control, because the enemy ranks are some of the freakiest bastards we've ever laid eyes on. Maken X draws much of its art design from 1940s communist and Nazi propaganda, fused with indescribably nasty aspects of body mutilation. There is some really disturbing stuff here, folks. In Amsterdam, the first enemies you'll run into are Nazi attack dogs, whose mouths have been cut off and replaced with grenades. There are also faceless enemy soldiers with chain-guns mechanically fused into their chests, and shock troopers in spiked helmets, with swastikas for faces. And it gets worse  just wait until you get into the insane asylum. Take our advice and play it with the lights off.  Maken X places its nightmarish characters in suitably atmospheric levels, which span the globe from India to Hong Kong. Though some of the environments are obviously low-polygon, the game books at 60fps without any slowdown, and some of the effects are stunners. Remember the cool puddle-reflections in the PS2 Tekken Tag Tournament demo? They're in here. So is the ~heat wave~ effect from Gran Turismo 2000. And stumbling into a dark office building with only the glowing red eyes of your enemies visible is enough to give you goose bumps.   Though most of the levels take from ten to fifteen minutes to complete, there are a ton of them. There's an Indiana Jones-style world map where you can select a location to play, and heading back to earlier levels with newly brain-jacked characters is definitely to your advantage. The world map also lets you access an on-line encyclopedia on the game's universe, and gives you full write-ups and bios for the characters, objects, and locations you'll discover.   All in all, it looks good, it plays great, and it's got more freak-out moments than a David Lynch film  the Japanese release of Maken X truly rocks. Atlus should be commended for a bang-up job on this incredibly unique title  and if an uncensored, domestic American release is in this title's future, it's going to make a lot of gamers very happy.  -- Colin ~FPS stands for First Person Samurai~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 1, 1999"}
