So, with other games already available, True Swing Golf isn't really filling a necessity on the dual screen handheld. But even with that said, this game is surprisingly solid and well developed, even if it lacks a huge assortment of features and won't exactly win a beauty pageant with its visual appeal. True Swing Golf's real value is in its tight use of the touch screen to pull off a great playing game of golf.   T&E Soft's been in the whole golf game since the 16-bit days, but even with that intense focus on one particular sports genre, the team's links offerings have always been hit or miss. Its latest golf incarnation, True Swing Golf, may be rather generic in presentation, but it could possibly be the company's best golf game yet. The team picks up on the missed opportunities left by EA's Tiger Woods' DS rendition - though the game lacks professional players and real courses, True Swing Golf creates touch-screen control that's intuitive and works well in a familiar golfing environment.   Gone is the usual, familiar, but ultimately successful ~hit button to start the swing, hit button to time the shot~ gameplay mechanic of video golf. In its place is full touch-screen control that mimics whacking the ball with the clubhead: drag back the stylus and drive on through to the ball icon to send it on its way down the fairway. The power and accuracy comes from how far back the stylus was pulled, how fast the players swing-through was, and how close to the center of the ball icon the player was when he followed through. It's a simple mechanic where drawing a straight line is key, and though it may seem like control that might be too easy to learn and adapt, it really does work.    Anyone can draw a straight line if they take their time, but that affects how fast the swing is, and ultimately, how much energy you'll get out of the clubhead. Blasting the stylus as quickly as possible will, in theory, get more drive and distance out of the ball, but that wilder draw makes it much more likely that you'll miss the sweet spot on the target. This accuracy is affected even more when you want to add a fade or draw to the drive; starting the swing to the left or right will curve the ball's trajectory, which is a technique that will come more and more into play in the harder courses. And when you have to start drawing an angled line, the chances of a ~whiffed~ shot become even greater. And no matter how good you are at this swing mechanic, there will be the occasional whiff when your confidence level gets too high and you try to crank out a 150 MPH swing.   The touch screen is also used for much of the user interface of True Swing Golf. Through a 2D overhead map, players can easily plot out their next shot, select their club, select a top or backspin during the drive, along with other random menu tasks. It's a very barebones interface with very little glitz and glamour, but it works well to streamline the entire process. The game doesn't control exclusively with the touch screen, and in some cases it should have - the ~power shot~ control is attached to the shoulder button, where a single touch button could have been assigned as well. But even with the odd swapping between touch screen and system buttons, the game still plays pretty tightly.     A swing mechanic is only as good as the physics engine that follows it. No matter how well your shot may be off the tee, if the game has poor ball mechanics for the airborne shot or the fairway roll, it doesn't matter how well the game controls pre-shot. Which is why it's a good thing that True Swing Golf handles its balls well. The ball rolls and bounces realistically in the 3D engine, and the variety of terrain affects the shot before and after the swing as well as expected in a solidly-developed golf game. Putting may be a little touchier than what you might expect, and the ball seems to bounce off the rim of a cup with a bit more bounce than the usual golfing affair. But after a little practice and familiarity with the way the putting's handled in True Swing Golf you'll easily adjust your play to make sure that white ball's sunk in the easy shots.   True Swing Golf plays well, but admittedly the great gameplay has to shine through the bland visuals and somewhat lacking features list. This golf game misses a few key elements for a ~realistic~ golf game, namely player licenses and realworld courses. Some of the best golf games, like Mario Golf and Hot Shots Golf lack both of these as well, but they also benefit from a more exaggerated game of links with additional gameplay features to spice up the action. True Swing Golf is straightforward generic golf with only the basics of golf matches, and it's missing some features that most golf games have. You can't save or view your best shots on a course, for example, so if you happen to land a Hole in One, you'll simply have to relive that moment in your mind.   And, of course, the game's just not all that pretty. Compared to Tiger Woods DS it's a visual triumph, of course, but there's no denying that the game just looks muddy and bland with disturbingly low resolution textures. The blocky graphics make it hard to appreciate the television-style presentation, especially when the camera tries to show a long-distance putt in a cutaway and the resolution makes it impossible to see where the hole is on the green.   But it's still a strong experience thanks to a career mode that encourages players to advance through the ranks via money awards. This cash can be spent at the golf shop on unnecessary items like shirts and hats, but also on equipment that can change the way you play the courses. There will be clubs, balls, shoes that can enhance the standard and special shots with more distance, better roll, wilder fades and draws.   The addition of single cartridge multiplayer beefs up the replay value. Much of the multiplayer experience will come from the multi-cartridge network, but this game allows for full-featured two-to-four competitions using only one copy of the game. This multiplayer mode is as seamless as the single player options, and players have a really cool added ability to send Pictochat-style messages to each other, even while someone's in the middle of their shot as a neat little ~psych out.~The game's look may be an initial turnoff, but you'll easily be able to see the gameplay shine through. T&E Soft has pulled off a really fun and challenging golf game with some great course designs and a fantastic, intuitive touch screen swing mechanic. The lack of any sort of license is a bummer, but the game design definitely holds its own without them, and True Swing Golf's real claim to fame is that it offers up something unique for golf fans to appreciate.", "date": "Jan 21, 2006"}
