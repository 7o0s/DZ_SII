This possibility soon turned into reality and was unveiled to be Sin and Punishment. However, it wasn't a true Nintendo-only (Nintendo R&D 1 aided the developers) development effort. As it turns out, the developer behind Sin and Punishment is the highly acclaimed Treasure. And that's just what Sin and Punishment is. A valuable treasure that may go widely overlooked in America if Nintendo doesn't do something about it. Currently the title is Japanese-only, so the only way to get your hands on it is to import it.  Sin and Punishment has quickly rocketed to the top of our ~must-have~ list. It remains to be a Tour de Force of endless arcade-style shooting action. In fact it's a title you simply don't want to end, and find yourself in disbelief when it does all too soon.   Features   One to two players Rail shooter (forward-facing, 2D feel) Real-time cut-scenes Voice acting 256 megabit (32 MB) cartridge Built-in EEPROM to save your game and high scores Rumble Pak support    Gameplay There is simply no easy way to describe Sin and Punishment's storyline. The game opens up with a group of rebels that are gunned down by armed forces. These rebels' last cries were to their leader, Achi. Most of the rebels died there, leaving only Achi and a few of her prodigies -- Saki and Airan. Then, after a few scenes of foreshadowing dialogue, the story begins to take some shape. The rebels are fighting to save humanity from the Rufians, who are animals that have been genetically mutated. The armed forces are also fighting against the Rufians, but their cause has been corrupted. So the rebels are forced to clash with both a military beast and the genetically mutated beasts known as the Rufians. It is best summed up as a tale that deals with political corruption, genetic mutations, with some fantastical surprises thrown in.  Once you absorb some of the bizarre plot you can get to the actual gameplay. There are two difficulty modes: easy and normal. Your best bet is to play through on easy and develop your skills along the way. Once you've done that you can head back through in normal mode, which will prove much more difficult. For beginners, the first level is designed quite well and features a good amount of balance. You'll have a lot of time to adjust to the control scheme and point system because there is a lot to shoot and not so much going on that it will weigh down your senses. The way the control scheme is set up is as follows: The controller can actually be used one of two ways, being designed for both right-handed and left-handed individuals. In the first right-centric control scheme the C-left and C-right buttons are used to strafe from left to right.  And, since Sin and Punishment progresses as if it were on a ~railroad track~ -- only moving forward, never backwards -- jumping up and down and strafing are your primary movements. In the second left-centric control scheme the player can use the D-pad (in place of the C-buttons) to strafe from the left to right. In both setups the Z-trigger is used to fire your weapon (your crosshair is always active), and depending on if you use the left-centric or right-centric control you'll use one of the shoulder buttons, L or R, to jump. Of course, there's some added depth to the controls. You can tap the strafe button twice to quickly roll in one direction, and pressing the jump button twice in a row offers a double jump. Your gun also comes equipped with a light saber, of sorts. By simply double tapping the Z-trigger you can activate it, but it will only work when something like an enemy or missile is close to you. It's a very strategic move and will play a vital role in making it to the end, especially in normal mode.   The gameplay revolves around a few very important elements, those being your health and the time left on the counter. In normal mode enemies can take more fire than they do in easy mode so time is going to run out faster. There are a few solutions to this problem. The easiest (although easier said than done) is defeating the enemy faster. To do this you will often have to draw your sword at every possible moment. Usually the more difficult opponents fire projectiles at you that you can bat back at them with your sword. This will certainly quicken their death. However, if you're more of a sharp shooter you can usually blow up external objects like missile launchers, sentry guns, and the like for time bonuses. Depending on the situation these external objects may give you a time bonus, health, or points. Suffice it to say that you will need to destroy everything as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The point system is actually quite effective and very arcade in design. It counts every hit (read: explosion or death) you make on the screen as, ~Hit  45,~ and onward. These hits continue to add up as long as you don't die. For every 100 hits you get a point bonus and an extra credit to continue. So your efforts to hit everything won't go without reward, and there's even some strategy involved. You can gain extra hits if you're quick enough. For example a platform may hold three men atop it. If you destroy the platform, you get one hit. If you destroy the three men separately and then the platform you'll get four hits. If you play smart you'll get big points and plenty of rewards.   After you become accustomed to the controls and interface you'll be ready to face the entire game. It is broken up into three major themes ranging from Tokyo's surrounding plains and cities to off Japan's coast and finally into outer space. Each of those three themes features several sub-sections creating the classic level layout, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, etc. Even that is generalizing it, though, because even those sub-sections tend to range over a few cut-scenes and themes. Now, while Sin and Punishment is extremely diverse and varied, it ends quite abruptly. It's the one complaint we have about this fine title; it ends too soon.   Certainly the sheer assortment of stages and bosses is wonderful, but there's still only a short amount of gameplay there. You can absolutely beat it within a day. If you play through on the easy setting, you're looking at a few hours to absorb the cut-scenes and play through. If you set it on normal, your time to completion will dramatically increase as things become very challenging. All in all, though, its glory is over far too quickly.   What this exceptional piece of software does offer is pure arcade-style fun, with brilliant level designs and huge bosses (around every corner) to go along with it. There has to be at least 25 different bosses and mini-bosses in Sin and Punishment, if not twice that. There's so much giant opposition that it brings a smile of awe to your face, because with every boss comes the chance of an accomplishment. At some moments you will even face three bosses in a row, which is a big adrenaline rush. The superior opposition is definitely one of the highlights of the gameplay. The level designs are also huge and clever. Everything is placed to increase drama, and all the atmospheres change dramatically throughout the quest. You will fight atop elevators, take to the sky and defy gravity, bear the desert heat, side-scroll, clash swords with the enemy, and even fight the earth itself. Needless to say the levels are a treat for the senses and will always keep you on your toes.  One area we would have liked to see some more variance in is weapon sets or armor. You have one gun/sword and give or take a situation or two in the game, you only use that throughout the entire quest. It's a bit of a downer that there weren't weapon or armor upgrades to gain. The good news is that it doesn't really take away from the brilliant play mechanics that are present, but it would have proved to be a great addition.  Lastly, expanding on the difference between easy and normal mode it must be said that playing both modes is well worth it. Easy mode is a good trainer and normal mode is the focused battle that challenges you for perfect accuracy. Time will run out and your health will run very low if you don't know what you're doing. Also, there are extra characters and bosses that become active in normal mode. So with that said, the playtime for Sin and Punishment could become four or five hours worth if you play both modes. The extra bosses and opposition is very worthwhile, and trying to break your highest score becomes a priority too. Which is one of the best aspects of the title. Because it is so much like the arcade, you can just sit down and try to destroy as much stuff as possible to break your highest score. And, if you're good enough you'll open up new modes of gameplay, bonus options (e.g. music test mode), and the ability to access any level for practice. Another way to really practice is the tutorial mode that takes you through all the motions to hone in on all your skills. It's hardly anything simple, either. You'll have to be able to roll, and shoot with great accuracy to make it through it with any success. Think of it more as a Danger Room than a tutorial. It is also point based, so you can try to beat your best scores here as well.   If all this fun isn't enough, you can also hook up with a friend and play cooperatively. This mode is very unique, though, and not how you may think it. The first player is in control of the main character as usual, but the second-player can step in at any time and control the site on the gun. This splits up the tasks of dodging bullets and shooting them quite effectively. So, make sure you pick a trustworthy friend (or one that doesn't suck). The only problem with it is, if you're good enough you can manage all this on your own. So the mode becomes rather moot when you become an expert. Ideally you would have been able to play as one of the other characters, but alas that's not possible.  At the end of the day, Sin and Punishment shines through as one of the most unique and bold titles to ever hit the N64. Currently it is Japan-only, but if you have the means to import it by all means do. The text is in Japanese, but the voice-acting is not. So not only do you get a brilliant game, but you get to take in the story as well. Once you play with the menus enough, you'll figure out what is what, thus making the fact that it's in Japanese rather unimportant. This is definitely one of the most perfect import titles, if not the most perfect import title to ever hit the console. It's easy to navigate, features a lot of English, and is an absolute riot to play. This is a genre that has been sorely lacking on the Nintendo 64, and depriving yourself of it would be a grave mistake.   Graphics In a low-resolution environment Treasure and Nintendo have managed to more than make up for it in the form of fluid framerates and dazzling visual effects. At almost every instance there is usually a fountain of sparks, motion blur, or a combination of the two. You'll soon forget about the low-polygon character models or semi-stiff animation. The art direction is equally impressive, because visually everything was done in a luxurious manner. Anyone with epilepsy is strongly encouraged to stay away from this flashy title. It's a sparkling, bursting, exploding, shimmering, glowing feast for the eyes.   Sound You love indulging techno-beats, you love the Matrix soundtrack, you're inspired by the electronic thumps of today's modern DJs. Well then chances are you're not going to like the 80s-tinged guitar and synthesizer-driven tunes of Sin and Punishment. They are all very fitting, but admittedly outdated. If the game was set in the 80s or was released in the 80s the composition would be considered great. But, unfortunately the music comes across as being outdated. On the good side, though, it suffices and when coupled with the great gameplay it creates an almost nostalgic atmosphere.   The sound effects and voice-overs are also to be appreciated. Everything is above average, but certainly not on par with something like Rogue Squadron. Most of the sound effects, even in their mediocrity, do a wonderful job of complimenting the amazing visual effects. Everything is well placed and punctual. Our one real complaint is that your gun makes little to no sound unless you hit something. For something like this it works well because you want to know when you've hit something, but on the other hand it would have been nice to have a little something to back up the gunfire. The voice acting that overlays everything has its good points and bad points. What is bad about it is the actual acting. In most cases it's very monotonous and has little energy. On the plus side a lot of the characters yell at you mid-game keeping you good and angry. Our favorite voice actor in Sin and Punishment is Brad, the epitome of evil. Thankfully the developers got a fairly talented voice actor for such a pivotal role. There is one simple fact you need to understand: you don't really need to know Japanese to play this game. There are about eight choices on the main menu, but after some trial and error you'll know exactly what is what. Personally, I found Sin and Punishment to be one of the best games to ever grace the N64. My one complaint is that it ends too soon. So, basically what I'm saying is that I can't get enough of it. It really just blows you away with totally unadulterated fun. You can never get too much of a good thing, and that stands irrefutably true in this case. The brief gameplay is Sin and Punishment's biggest weakness, and it leaves me hoping there will be another game like this in the not too distant future (*cough* Gamecube *cough*). Treasure is brilliant and indisputable when it comes to action-shooters like this. The only thing I could really ever offer to their dazzling design philosophies is to make the games longer. The average player will get at least several hours out of this title, which if played straight through will turn your mind into chaos. It's so hectic and intense that if it was a 10 hour game, it could possibly drive you insane. But, with that in mind it's still something you wish you could keep going back to. Instead it ends up being a brief, intense experience. The only reasons you really have to go back to it is to try your luck with the increased difficulty on normal mode, and to break your highest score. So, I ask you the reader to consider a title like Contra or Star Fox. If you liked these titles you'll absolutely love Sin and Punishment. Import this game, even if it is for a relatively short-lived experience. In the age of sporadic N64 releases, there are not many purchases that would be more worthwhile.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
