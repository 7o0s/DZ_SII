{"name": "Metal Gear Solid", "name_review": "Metal Gear Solid", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/27/metal-gear-solid", "text": "This has been a long time coming. After hearing console gamers brag about having one of the most innovative titles in years, PC gamers can not only reply like snobs about having a crispier version of the original title, but about having the unreleased Integral version of the title as well. Take that PlayStation. As a PC gamer it was easier to ignore the merits of Zelda, another groundbreaker released the same year, because it was just plain foreign to a PC crowd used to realism (well, other PC gamers -- you are talking to someone who grades titles on the butt to mushroom potential). But Metal Gear was right up our alley -- the plotline was adult, the weapons were spot on perfect, and the action took a good brain and an itchy trigger. Perfect stuff for the PC... and so we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Now it's finally out for the PC -- but two years later, does Metal Gear still hold up? Yes.  This is a must-have title for anyone looking for an experience that's equal parts Thief, Deus Ex, and classic platformer. This is an action game at heart, and the controls can easily be wrangled within the confines of a Sidewinder pad, but that's not to say that there isn't a load of depth beneath the trigger. Original descriptions of the title were generally married with the terms ~cinematic~ and ~interactive movie,~ but unlike the other times those phrases have been used to describe a game, they were meant as wholehearted complements.   Metal Gear Solid's plot is a pulpy mix of anime, gritty action film, and soap opera. You're a retired operative, the notorious Solid Snake, sent to a nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska to stop a terrorist takeover. Along the way you'll meet a variety of characters, battle family and foes, and of course, fall just a little bit in love. But while all of this fleshes out a story that twists and turns constantly, it's also one of the few times where it works seamlessly with the gameplay, constantly giving you a new experience. Just as Half-Life used plot devices to keep you on your toes, so Metal Gear Solid throws in a capture attempt, torture, sniping spies and double-crossers to have you constantly watching your back -- literally.  But first, let's break down the gameplay. At the top right of the screen is a sort of radar, which keeps track of your enemies and their sightline, as well as security cameras. Just as in Thief, characters react to sound as well as sight, so you'll have to move carefully to avoid getting caught. Pressing up against a wall will give you a new camera view of a corner, to check on moving soldiers, and a first-person view also helps you get a better bearing on your surroundings (the PC version also includes the US debut of the special first-person mode of the game... nearly impossible to play, but fun to mess around with). If you get the attention of an enemy, you'll have to keep out of sight until he loses attention -- but if he catches you in his sightline, he'll call his friends, and you'll be in for a battle. Not to mention that you'll lose your radar for a specified amount of time, leaving you blind and scrambling to find a hiding place until your foes die down. As you're probably starting to notice, there are repercussions to almost every action you take in the game, unlike most action titles. If you walk through the snow, you better be ready for an enemy to notice, then follow your path. Metal walkways mean louder footsteps, and so on. For every ounce of detail in the game, there's still that classic Japanese wackiness, such as being able to hide in a cardboard box and creep around areas -- without anyone noticing the difference. The characters are smart enough to be engaging, but dumb enough to remind you that you're still playing an action game here, not Rainbow Six.  The game isn't just about sneaking, however. You'll spend a tremendous amount of time hiding in boxes, creeping through air ducts, hiding under tanks and throwing flash grenades to blind cameras, but you'll also have access to a wide variety of weapons. Sniper rifles, rockets, mines, plastic explosives, uzis and pistols are just some of the tools at your disposal. You can always sneak up behind an enemy and drag them out of sight... but you could also take them out quietly with a good gun and a silencer, as well. While the game doesn't have nearly the amount of open-ended gameplay available in Deus Ex, you'll still be amazed at just how open you are to trying different ways to make it through a particular problem. But when it's time to blast, it'll be time to blast, with guns blazing. Bosses are incredibly tough, and you'll have to deal with shooting an aggressive enemy while avoiding hitting sensitive explosions, you'll have to deal with a tank using only your brains and (I don't want to ruin anything for you), and you'll have to take on a missile firing helicopter, solo. The plot thickens, Solid Snake becomes ever the brooding, suave hero, and people die -- a lot. And all the while, you'll be doing new tasks in new areas, using new weapons, involving new rulesets and scenarios, and -- you get the picture. I hate to sound nostalgic here, but playing this game for a second time just reminded me of how many other titles this has influenced since (both on PC and on consoles), and how damn fun and original it was to play it the second time around.  And then there are the VR missions. Sold separately on the PlayStation, you'll get them all as a free bonus when you purchase the original Metal Gear Solid.  Gladys from RonCo: You mean $40 more? Vincent: Nope. Gladys from RonCo: Well at least $20, right? Vincent: No. Free of charge Gladys from RonCo: Now that's a good deal! What do you say, everyone?  The VR missions are the training missions taken to extremes. You'll run through a series of Tron-like environments trying to accomplish specific tasks, broken up by theme, and broken up again by weapon usage. At around 300 missions, you'll have your hands full. As a separate purchase you may have found yourself a little disappointed at the at-time repetitious nature of the MGS VR Missions, but as an addition to the original title they're a welcome slice of quick gameplay. On top of the simplified VR Missions split up by weapon, you'll also be able to take on the Puzzle mode and Mystery modes, which give you problem oriented missions, and kooky missions where you'll have to observe a situation and make the appropriate decision -- sort of a gun-based Clue, if you will. The PC version even gives you the Ninja mission, the camera missions, as well as other extras right off the bat, instead of having to unlock them by finishing specific VR sets. We're a lazy lot, us PC gamers, and we want our extras now, not later.  If there's a downside with Metal Gear Solid, it's the graphics. While Microsoft and Konami have done a great job of making the game look as crispy as possible, you're still dealing with PlayStation textures here. Characters, while animated smoothly, and filled with character, also lack any and all facial detail. Textures in general are well done, but far below the high bar set by titles like Combat Flight Simulator 2 and Sacrifice. They're far from being tiresome on the eyes, but there are times when you'll wish for the detail of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 2. The in-game menus also suffer from the translation. While the subtitles are crisp, featuring new fonts, the menus themselves are chunky and blotchy, and when you've pumped up the screen resolution, a general eyesore. The music is still excellent, however, and fits in perfectly with the game, as does the gritty voice acting that complements the long expository pieces of plot.  If there's anything you should get from seeing a review of Metal Gear Solid on the PC, it's finally, finally, finally. It's obvious here that I love this game to death, and it's also pretty obvious that this ~review~ is simply a long ad for why you, as a PC gamer, should run out and by this game. You won't be sad, but unlike Valium, you'll also be happy, not just in that sort of gray ~hi, who are you again?~ world of blissful numbness but in the honest sort of ~I enjoy my life as a gamer and this game validates my aberrant lifestyle~ way. The port is great, the game is fantastic, and despite no multiplayer support, the sheer size of the game (if you include the VR Missions) means that your money will be well spent.  And before we forget, for those of you having problems with the game, remember that we've got a guide up as well, guaranteed to get you through all the tough spots in the game.
