They'd be Barbie if Barbie was, like, cool.  Diva Starz Mall Mania brings these fab-a-licious Diva's to the world of portable gaming.  The girls are heading to a fashion show and they are so not ready.  Play as each of the four dream-a-delic Divas: Alexa, Nikki, Tia, and Summer.  There are six simple levels you need to beat with each of the girls in order to, like, win and stuff.  I was hoping for a totally cool, exciting, fun game.  Did I get that with Diva Starz?  Yawn.  Features Six groove-a-delic games and 4 cool-errific levels! Rock-o-matic dance moves and music! Cute-a-rama outfits! Diva-licious fashion show! Hip-tacular password save function! Only for the glam-a-licious Game Boy Color Diva Starz is clearly a game for young ladies.  So, to do this review I had to regress to a time when I was a young lass.  It was, like, the 80s and there were, like, lots of Pat Benetar wannabes wandering the streets.  It was scary.  But enough about my totally crunchy memories and onto Diva Starz.  For the unhip, here's a quick list of the Diva's ultra-sassy vocab, courtesy of Vivendi Universal:  Cool-a-delic: Ultra-cool, awesome.  Ex:~That movie was cool-a-delic!~ Funk-omatic: Rockin', totally hot.  Ex: ~This song is funk-omatic!~ Groove-a-licious: Really fun and cool.  Ex: ~This outfit is groove-a-licious!~ Fave-eriffic: A great time, a blast.  Ex: ~You're my fave-erific friend!~ Psych-a-delic: Trendy, radical.  Ex: ~Your hair looks psych-a-delic!~  When you beat the game with one gal, you gotta beat it with another.  Each time it gets a little harder.  Truth be told, it never really gets hard.  After picking one of the fantabulous Diva Starz, your first task will be the scooter spot.  Drive the scooter down the street and hit A to get some hops and nab the floating items.  This is, like, so mind-numbingly easy that I felt kinda cheated.  Even as the difficulty increases, it's pretty simple and bland-arama.   Yeah, it's a game for kids, but ya know, even kids deserve better.  After beating the scooter spot, you can choose from five glamorous mall-related levels: Music spot, pet shop spot, snack spot, fashion spot, or style spot.  Let's tiptoe on over to the music spot first.  Oh.  My.  God.  How totally Dance Dance Revolution!  Follow the hip-errific beat and press the buttons that show up on the screen.  Move it baby, move it!  This is a pretty groovy level and my fave by far.  Still, it's pretty slow and doesn't require any real accuracy.  I know plenty of kids that can nail some tough Parappa and Dance Dance levels.  Like, don't be afraid to challenge kids.  But like I said, this was my fave level.  Maybe the game needed more dance and less scooter bike, ya know?  The fashion spot is like my Uncle Charlie--a little odd.  There's, like, these shopping bags moving on a conveyor belt and you have to toss items into the bags.  What-ever.  You gotta match the right item with the right bag, but it's kinda tough to see the items clearly.  So, it's like, oh my god what am I doing here??  And I was all frustrated and stuff.  This was a very non-fun gag-o-matic level that I so totally could have done without.  Like, why not just let me go shopping for the items I want to wear.  Let me put my daddy's plastic to work, ya know?  Snack spot made my tummy rumble because you are, like, making sundaes and I was all ~Oh I wish I wasn't on a diet or I'd, like, totally eat my Game Boy.~  It's like a puzzle, you have to move the pieces of the sundae from the plate on the left to the plate on the right.  You can't put a bigger piece on top of a smaller piece because, well, small goes on top of big.  Like, duh.  I like puzzles and mysteries because, like, Murder She Wrote was my favorite show when I was growing up even though I told my friends my fave show was Miami Vice.  It's not too tough of a puzzle to solve, but there is this time limit and all which offers some small challenge.  Okay, the pet shop spot was like almost as easy as the scooter ride.  There's this super small maze and all you have to do is find your puppy.  He's totally cute, but he has some gnarly breath.  Even for a kid, this is just way easy.  It's nice to find the puppy, though, 'cause, like, puppies are cool.  I passed this level with my eyes closed.  Seriously.    The style spot is, like, so my thing.  See, you get to pick out your outfit for the fashion show.  I'm like, ~This hat goes with this shirt, and these shoes are to die for!~  You get to choose the hat, top, bottom, and shoes you think will look fab.  But then the character might be all, ~This hat doesn't go with these shoes, yo.~  And so you have to find a different hat.  This is kind of a bummer 'cause I picked out some totally sweet threads for my Diva darlings and they made me change 'em.  And sometimes, like with Summer, the outfit they chose are, like, gag-me-with-a-hairnet ugly.  I'd rather be able to dress up Summer so she looks good, not tacky.  Whenever you pass the game with a character, you get to see them in the fashion show.  They're wearing the clothes and accessories you picked out and moving to the music you picked after beating the music spot.  Look at those camera bulbs flash!  Okay, it's kinda lame, actually.  Once you finish the game with all the girls, you get to see all four of them on the runway.  So it's like four times the lame.  Okay, so that's nice about all the levels and all, but is the game worth the price of admission?  Oh, heck no.  I'm playing this game, which took me all of a half hour to completely beat, and I noticed something totally unacceptable.  There's, like, hardly any animation.  The girls don't walk around, they just slide.  Welcome to the twenty-first century, girls.  In today's games it's expected that there'll be some effort to slip in some animation.  The game levels are so short and seem designed with such little effort that I was kind of offended.  This just isn't a game.  You don't have to dumb down a game just to make it ~for kids~.  There's several dream-a-delic music tracks and, like, the music is totally the best thing about the game.  The variety of music is totally glam-a-licious.  But music doesn't make a game good, and Diva Starz just isn't good.  I know, I know, this is a game for kids.  I thought about that, but then I realized that kids still deserve the extra effort.  Just 'cause it's for kids doesn't mean it can't have depth and challenge and, ya know, more going for it than a few short levels and some limited animation. I wanted to like Diva Starz.  I totally did.  But I felt gypped.  And I think anyone who buys this game, even a little miss, will be totally let down after playing it for just a little while.  This is a weak effort on a game that totally deserved better.  Diva Starz tried to be psych-a-dellic but ended up being suck-a-dellic.", "date": "Dec 1, 2001"}
