StarFox 64 represents                      the next leap in the                      evolution of Nintendo                      games, with full-speech                      samples,                      FMV-animation and                      fantastic production                      value, a challenging                      branch system, and                      multiplayer gaming all                      in one cartridge.   Staggered throughout                      the game is the use of                      full-motion video                      animation, eloquent                      cinematic sequences                      that wrap the gameplay                      up in a rich storyline,                      setting each mission                      with the right mood.                      Boasting a remarkable                      amount of voice                      sampling for a cart                      game, each team                      member's former                      burbles are turned into                      live voice samples.                      While not a CD-ROM                      killer, StarFox 64, like                      Super Mario 64 before                      it, demonstrates to                      second- and third-party                      developers what can be                      achieved on a single                      cartridge. StarFox 64 is                      an 8 megabyte cartridge                      containing almost 3                      MBs of straight sound,                      and each of the 23                      characters has, as it                      were, something to say.  An exceptional shooter that's only                        improved since its original 16-bit                        inception, StarFox 64 is deep with                        gameplay, strategy, and calculated                        level progression mechanics. Much                        like StarFox on Super NES, Slippy the                        frog, Peppy the hare, and Falco the                        falcon join Fox McCloud as they fly                        through space in their patented                        'Arwing' fighters in forward-scrolling                        fashion. Players will also pilot a rather                        clunky submarine and a unique tank                        (with hovering capabilities), depending                        on the various mission they encounter.                        But what differentiates StarFox 64                        from its past version is that gamers will                        play in both forward-scrolling levels,                        found in latter-day shooters like Sega                        Saturn's Panzer Dragoon, while newer                        missions enable full 3D movement,                        usually couched in a closed spherical                        environment. In each, the Arwings are                        capable of relatively quick acceleration,                        quick hard braking, Immelmans,                        loops, barrel rolls, and a wonderful                        control system that's as responsive,                        and as smooth as silk.   As many as 15 interconnected levels                         are playable in the single-player mode,                         each with the most amazing looking                         bosses seen in a long time. Ranging                         from a humungous clam in Aquas, to a                         lavish molten lava-monster in Solar, to                         an amazingly animated monkey head                         and hands in the easy ending, these                         bosses are fantastic in design and                         graphic execution. A clever set of paths                         are opened when players kill a                         specified amount of enemies, follow an                         unusual path, shoot subtle objects and                         enemies, fly through special                         constructs, or beat certain bosses. (In                         one level, if players fly through a set of                         blue rings they'll enter into a                         psychedelic bonus level that's the                         closest nod to Galaga we've seen in                         quite some time.) There are also a                         handful of paths in each level. This                         branch system, unlike the chooseable                         paths of the 16-bit StarFox, makes this                         often formulaic game a bit more                         challenging.   Multiplayer Modes                         The four-player, split-screen action                         deepens the game's overall value, with                         chooseable variations, like team-play,                         or all-out 'death-matches.' And it's a                         blast. Plus, after meeting certain                         requirements, you can play on foot,                         with laser cannons on your shoulders.                         For beginners, a practice mode is also                         available in one-player mode. And let's                         not forget that the Rumble Pak,                         bundled with the game, adds an                         unusual burst of arcade ecstasy to the                         game.                          There are a few disappointments,                         however, and these start with                         gameplay. With gameplay nods to                         Wing Commander (and cinematic                         references to a few recent sci-fi                         movies), the play is great, but not                         terribly innovative, nor altogether new,                         and with a few exceptions, it's a just a                         good update from the original StarFox.                         Second, this game, like all shooters by                         their very nature, is extremely                         repetitive. Almost all of the little details                         have been sorted out throughout the                         game, except the incredibly muddled                         and dark submarine level (Aquas). The                         music could also have been improved                         as well, and may have suffered due to                         the abundant sound samples.The branching system, loads of                        secret paths, intelligently designed                        levels, originally designed bosses, and                        multiplayer gaming all add up to                        overcome the game's minor                        weaknesses. If anything can be said,                        StarFox demonstrates that shooters are                        more alive now than ever.", "date": "May 17, 1997"}
