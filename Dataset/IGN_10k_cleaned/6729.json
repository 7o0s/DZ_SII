A bar maybe. Perhaps a book store. It doesn't really matter because when it comes down to it, I have no business sense and would run any entrepreneurial exercise into the ground in weeks. Still, the fantasy is there. I suppose that's why I always seem to pick up economic and business simulations when they come out on the PC. I can at least pretend that I'm a tycoon of some sort without having to invest actual money or prove to the world that I'm an ass with money. The newest expansion for The Sims 2, Open for Business, isn't exactly a traditional economic simulation, but it is one of the more interesting versions of the genre I've come across thanks to its singular Sims-style. Not everything is smooth sailing for this expansion, nor is everything fun, but Open for Business is still a worthy addition for any Sim-addict out there.   One of the big questions that most Sims lovers have been asking since the original game was released in 2000 was ~where the hell do these guys go when they head off to work?~ It's been a part of sim-life noticeably absent to many players, including myself. But beyond that, the bigger question to me has always been if it would actually be fun to see my sims working. The answer is a resounding ~mostly.~ Honestly, more often than not, it's pretty fun, but starting out a business can feel more like work than play.   Creating a business is actually really easy, if not exactly intuitive. Any quick glance at the manual will fill in the blanks, but those opposed to any perusing of paper products (PPP!) will need to bumble about until they have their sim pick up the phone or log onto the computer where sim-businesses make their humble beginnings. From there, sims can choose to purchase an existing community lot in the neighborhood (or in the associated shopping district) or just run a home business. Players can obviously also go ahead and create new community lots for the specific purpose of purchasing as well.    What I like about this is that it really opens up new reasons to re-consider architectural plans for business lots and homes. Designing a good business where retail has plenty of shelf space and room enough for customers to browse, entertainment venues have several options for fun, plenty of bathrooms so customers will stay longer, good lighting and whatever else is needed to make the place fun looking from a business perspective is a new challenge (if you discount The Sims Online, which I often do).   What's even more fun is that anything that sims like can be turned into a business. Whether it's something as obvious as a flower shop or as different as an astronomy club where sims are charged for time with telescopes (though I must mention telescopes are one of the few items you'll have to buy at home and transfer over to the business in your inventory for some reason), there are really no restrictions. How services are charged for is really the only big limiting factor. Retail requires a cash register while somewhere like a nightclub or bowling alley can charge by time spent in the establishment via the purchase of an entrance ticket. While the implementation of this is a little on the light side (I would have preferred to charge for the use of specific items), it's easy enough to understand. The main point here is that if you want all of your employees dressed in gorilla outfits, go for it. If you want bowling and haircuts in the same place, so be it. It doesn't matter and imagination is the limit.   Planning and creating creative environments in which to run businesses is the fun part of this experience. Actually running them can be a pain in the ass. Not only does it take commitment but it also takes a huge amount of cash, especially if the goal is retail. Buying a business building and stocking it with goods can be incredibly expensive. For this reason, it's a lot easier to try with rich kids from previous households that have inherited tons of money. Without that advantage (or the advantage of the cheat menu) Sims are going to have to bust ass to stay afloat towards the beginning.   Beginning businesses will generally depend on sims running around doing every task on the menu whether that's sales, register, restocking, or crafting. Employees can be expensive and usually come to the job without much training meaning they might not be as much of a helping hand to a fledgling business and they're costing precious resources.   Building up training in general is pretty time consuming and a bit of a mystery. These new talent badges are the new ways for sims to show their aptitude for different work activities. Working the register enough will allow sims to gain a badge and become more proficient which in turn allows for quicker checkout at the counter. But there's no telling how far an employee is along in the training. It's also pretty much impossible to tell what skills regulate the learning rate of each task. The manual certainly doesn't say. So when hiring a new employee to work the register, it's hard to know which employee to hire when none of them have a talent badge.    Retail and entertainment businesses have a couple of different challenges going for them as well. Retail seems to be much easier to build up in rank because of constant interaction with customers whereas entertainment lots are dependant on time to build opinion. On the other hand, entertainment properties take much less overhead to create and very little staff.   The good news is that once a business has gotten past any initial hurdles, made enough money to hire good employees, and grown in popularity, it's pretty much smooth sailing and the money will come rolling in. And really, it's fun to watch a business be a success. It's fun to add on expansions and watch a business grow even more popular. Eventually, it's even possible to franchise and continue building and growing. Once employees become good enough to hire as management, sims can even lounge at home and simply call in to the businesses from time to time to see how things are going.    As businesses gain in popularity and satisfied customers, the reputation and rank increases. Every rank gained will open the option to add a perk onto the owner. This includes advantages like being able to make acquaintances with another sim's entire contact list (and get a substantial relationship bonus as well), gain a cash bonus, restock items for a cheaper wholesale price, and motivate employees and influence other sims. The best thing about all of these perks is that they transfer over into regular sim life. They're noticeable rewards for spending the time to grow a business.    And as usual, Maxis has done a wonderful job adding new and fun items and decorations to the ever expanding catalog of objects. The obligatory new set of furniture is backed up by some great crafted toys like the water octopus and fun robots like the hydrobot for watering your plants and the servo robot that actually acts like a sim (aside from its penchant for serving). In fact, some of these objects actually have to be made with the new crafting benches and in order to build the best robots, toys, or flower arrangements, a sim has to gain the highest talent badge for that craft. It's a nice reward for increasing a sim's talents, but it's also a tiny bit sad that one sim pretty much has to be devoted to practicing for a long time in order to reach that status.This is probably my least favorite of the expansions to this point. That's not saying it's bad, it just takes more work than I want to put into it. Now that The Sims has gone beyond the need to tell sims to go to the bathroom whenever they need to, I'm forced to tell them to do all kinds of things in a work environment. It can take a long damn time to build talents up to acceptable levels and while the reward is pretty good (seeing the business flourish and all), it's almost not enough to make me want to do it again.The best part of the expansion is the added incentive to be more creative about constructing, decorating, and purposing buildings. It means thinking about the best way to organize an environment to maximize profit while making sure the customers are happy.One last thing worth mentioning is that Open for Business really is good for building on content that was in previous expansion packs. Nightlife especially has several objects and gameplay ideas that make this newest expansion better than it would be on its own.If you're a fan of The Sims 2 series of games and have the previous expansions, I'd say this is definitely worth a look. But if you're not into micromanagement this may be one that you can skip. Open for Business has some great ideas, but they aren't always realized as well as they could have been.", "date": "Mar 15, 2006"}
