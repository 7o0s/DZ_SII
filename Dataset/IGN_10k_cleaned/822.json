Decidedly anime when the only Japanese characters you could find on TV were 'Battle Of The Planets' re-runs, Mega Man combined cool cartoon graphics with solid platform/action gameplay. It just didn't get any better than that. Ten years on, and Mega Man is now in his eighth game. However, little has changed. He's still blue, he's still 2D, and although he's called a 'Man,' he's still obviously a boy.  Dr. Wily is back again, this time threatening   the world with a strange energy source. A   meteor has fallen to earth, and encased   inside the big rock is a robot. Dr. Wily   takes possession of the robot and its   powerful energy, and uses it to   generally wreak havoc. Mega Man has   befriended the second robot in the meteor,   and together they must defeat Dr. Wily.   Again.  Mega Man 8 is pretty much what you'd   expect it to be. It's jam-packed with sprites,   and has that familiar Capcom-anime style   made famous by Darkstalkers and Street   Fighter Alpha. You've got lots of special   weapons to buy, including bombs, ice, and   tornado weapons. Scattered through out the   levels are bolts, which you can use to   customize Mega Man. You can reduce his   energy consumption, make him temporarily   invulnerable, and so on. His dog is back to   help you too.  So this is what it comes down to: do you really want to play another 2D Mega Man game? If so, then you'll like Mega Man 8. It's got all the elements that make the Mega games so challenging: moving platforms, a moderate level of difficulty, and fast, pattern-based bosses. However, if you've grown up and cast these games aside with your Master System and G.I. Joe collection, you'll probably want to wait for the imminent 3D Mega Man.  Mega Man 8 is a good, solid game, it's just been done too many times before.", "date": "Mar 31, 1997"}
