This is exactly what publisher Majesco and developer Skyworks haven't done with their aerial combat game, F-24 Stealth Fighter. Although it bears a striking resemblance to games like Afterburner and Top Gun (NES), it's not nearly as enjoyable as those titles were decades ago. F24 Stealth Fighter is a step backwards in the evolution of the flight combat genre, and the sooner it's forgotten and off game shelves, the better.    As the intro sequence explains, the President has deployed military forces in Iran to stop the sale of nuclear weapons. This is done, presumably, by piloting an F-24 around and blowing everything out of the sky. The game is a series of simple missions that involve taking out a specific number of enemy jets, or enemy bases, before returning home. All of this is done through the first-person cockpit, where a variety of flight controls fill the bottom half of the screen, with a thin strip of horizon on the top half.    Flight sims can be very fun, and if memory serves there hasn't been a great one on the GBA yet. That's not going to change with this title. F24 Stealth Fighter isn't an awful game, but it's so dull, predictable and unrewarding that there's really no need to play it. The developers have made so many poor decisions in the game's design that it's a complete chore to play.    One of the main problems with the game is the lousy interface. Every piece of information is delivered in incredibly small text with no effort made to reinforce this information visually. Swapping between weapons, which all have similar or identical icons, is a trial and error process that requires firing a few off (from a very limited supply) before it's apparent what type of weapon is being used. Half the weapons don't even have a visual representation when fired, making them just that much more abstract.    Controls aren't intuitive at all. The aircraft is controlled with the D-pad in standard flight sim fashion and the A button fires the current weapon. But instead of using the B button for a secondary weapon or a boost in speed, it's used to toggle how the other buttons are used. To increase speed, the B button must be held down while tapping up or down on the D-pad. Because of this, it's not possible to move the aircraft around while adjusting the speed, which frequently turns the aircraft into a sitting duck. And since the speed is being set rather than manually controlled, it's very difficult to increase or decrease speed on the fly to avoid or chase enemies.    Changing weapons requires holding down the B button, then tapping the L and R buttons (also annoying), while the L and R buttons by themselves are used interchangeably for looking behind the pilot (a thoroughly pointless feature used as an excuse for some pilot eye candy). Things get even more confusing when attempting to drop an ECM pod, which requires holding down the L or R button, and then pressing the A or B button.    Let's just sum it up and say these controls blow. It feels like the developers have never played a GBA game. To make matters worse, neither the control scheme nor the easily-forgotten mission objective can be accessed during gameplay; once a mission has started, players are on their own until it's over. For an example of how this complicates gameplay, some of the sea-bound enemies can only be killed by a certain weapon type. Unfortunately, this information is only given once before the mission, and since all secondary weapons run out after a few shots, kamikaze-ing into the ocean and starting over is often the only option.    Enemy jets in the game move so fast and take so much damage before exploding, it's hard to strategize any attacks and still have time pull them off. An easier exploit is to turn the plane sideways, circle upward along the horizon and blast enemies each time they come into visibility. Since I'm pretty sure this isn't how real dogfights are won, it's safe to assume the gameplay is broken.    Actually tracking down enemies is an arduous task, due to the over-complicated, inefficient radar system. As the aircraft spins and pivots, white dots representing the enemies appear. Unfortunately, depending on how close the enemy jets are, the radar will swap between multiple, abstract layouts. The radar also has a very short range, making it difficult to see any jets until just before they're about to fly by.    The game moves smoothly with a solid frame rate. It features a detailed control panel, but that's really all this game does well graphically. Enemies are generally just a single frame and effects are kept very minimal. With such a simple game, some visual flair like smoke trails, larger explosions and more impressive clouds would have added a lot to the experience. As it is now, the sky feels very empty.       At the end of each mission, the aircraft must be landed back on the local carrier, an exercise that's too easy and boring. Players tilt their craft left and right to line it up with the ever-nearing carrier. The problem is that once the plane gets close, the game takes over and lands the craft safely. The player doesn't have to worry about pitch or speed or any other factors that a real pilot would. Even sillier, if a landing isn't coming together well, the player can just press up on the D-pad and backpeddle their aircraft several hundred yards; last time I checked, F24s didn't have a gear for mid-flight reverse.    The game offers two difficulty settings (Ace and Novice), as well as invertible controls, adjustable audio levels and the option to practice landing in a variety of locations. That's all this game brings to the table. F-24 Stealth Fighter does what it sets out to, but the game is plain, boring, unstrategic and confusing. The core gameplay is there, but the controls and presentation could have used a lot more tweaking to make this game remotely enjoyable.", "date": "Jan 19, 2007"}
