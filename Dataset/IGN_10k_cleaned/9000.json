I finally know what the hell Kurt Cobain is saying in ~Come As You Are,~ and it's all thanks to this title from Sony. The help might be about a decade or so too late to make me look cool at St. Petronille Grade School, but it's still welcome.  Want to know what I know? You'll get your chance next week when SingStar Amped launches on the PlayStation 2 with 30 songs and music videos from bands such as O.A.R. and Foo Fighters.   What's that? You don't know what SingStar is? Egad, man -- it's Sony's answer to what a karaoke videogame should be. You pick a song from the likes of Radiohead, the Ramones and David Bowie, pick up one of the SingStar microphones -- which can come bundled with the game for $50 -- and croon along with the words as they illuminate on screen. To do well, you'll need to fill in these blank bars on screen with your player color.   How do you fill them in? By singing perfectly.     If your pitch is too high, you'll paint the area above the bars. If your pitch is too low, you'll paint the areas below the bars. When you get to the end of the on-screen lyrics, the game gives you a written critique such as ~cool~ or ~awful~ and scores the performance before adding it to your ever accumulating overall score.   Those are the basics that have been with the franchise for years. We'll get into some more mode detail in a second, but let's talk about what makes this game different from the rest of the SingStar pack -- song selection.   Amp It Up!Alice in Chains -- WouldO.A.R. -- Love and MemoriesAudioslave -- CochisePearl Jam -- AliveBlink 182 -- I Miss YouPoison -- Every Rose Has Its ThornBlue Oyster Cult -- (Don't Fear) The ReaperQueens of the Stone Age -- Go with the Flow Boston -- More Than a FeelingQuiet Riot -- Cum on Feel the NoizeCheap Trick -- I Want You to Want MeRadiohead -- CreepDavid Bowie -- ChangesRamones -- Blitzkrieg BopFall Out Boy -- This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms RaceSteppenwolf -- Born to Be WildFoo Fighters -- Best of You Stone Temple Pilots -- VasolineFree -- Alright NowSublime -- SanteriaIggy Pop -- Real Wild Child (Wild One)Talking Heads -- Burning Down the HouseJudas Priest -- You've Got Another Thing ComingThe Killers -- When You Were Young Motorhead -- Ace of SpadesYeah Yeah Yeahs -- Gold LionNickelback -- Savin' Me Yes -- Owner of a Lonely HeartNirvana -- Come As You Are ZZ Top -- Gimme All Your Lovin'  Interesting mix, eh? It's not everyday that Fall Out Boy shares a billing with Steppenwolf, but it would appear that the only criteria to getting on Amped was the ability to rock in some sort of fashion. For the most part it works -- who doesn't wan to belt out some ~Don't Fear the Reaper?~ -- but a few of the song choices felt a little bit awkward. Blink 182's ~I Miss You?~  Motorhead ~Ace of Spades?~ Were these the biggest ~hits~ they could get from these bands?   Still, there are enough tracks on this disc for everyone to find something they can sing, and that's what SingStar is all about. Your enjoyment of Amped comes down to how many goofy friends you have that are cool with making fools out of themselves. Earlier this week, we hosted an IGN SingStar Showdown -- a double-elimination tournament to crown the best crooner in the office. Thirteen editors and one visiting fiance showed up to go off on Poison and remember the days when Radiohead was everywhere.   The battle was fierce, the talent was minimal, and pizza was free.   Our two-hour competition relied on Battle -- one of the Party modes that had two players singing the same song at the same time for the best score -- but if we weren't blood-thirsty gladiators, we could have busted out some Duets or divided into two teams for Pass the Mic, where up to eight players toss the mics around while trying to succeed in a set of seven challenges such as being the first to rake in 5,000 points and best each other in overall medley scores.      So, there's a wealth of multiplayer options for you to go to town on with friends, but if you're more of a solo artist and prefer to rock out alone, you're screwed. Single-player leaves you with two options: sing solo and try to best the high scores across the three difficulties, or head into Freestyle and sing without any pitch/timing indicators or score.   It's the biggest chink in SingStar's armor, but I have trouble faulting Sony for it. The company has always promoted the game in videos and in conversation as a multiplayer experience. They want this to be a game you get your friends around to play, and on that level, it succeeds. However, the lack of anything unlockable or any kind of career mode stunts the true potential of this franchise. Although, I love to look like an idiot in front of friends; maybe I could get better at the songs I'm butchering if I played by myself, but for that to happen, I need to be working towards something. I don't want to be playing and practicing for nothing.   That's a shame because practice literally makes perfect in this game.  Are you a wild child? If you don't know the melody and lyrics of these songs, you're done. SingStar wants you to sing these songs just like they were performed in their music videos -- you can't adjust for your personal range -- and that means folks tend to avoid the songs they don't know all that well.   See if you can follow this flow chart: Bobby only knows 11 songs on Amped - Bobby sings those songs every time he plays - Bobby starts to get sick of those songs but doesn't want to try something new because he'll lose - Bobby gets bored and stops playing Amped.   Sound crazy? It's not. During our tournament, we were only a few matches into the Amped bracket when people started asking to sing songs others had already performed. Basically, SingStar's focus on multiplayer is a catch-22. People want to win, they stick to what they know, and the move drastically cuts down the number of songs people are going to want to sing on the disc. If the game had a single-player mode that forced singers to branch out, the song library would open up to everyone either by experience or watching a seasoned vet play new tracks.  With pipes like these, the chicks come easy. Am I being to hard on SingStar? Nah, I'm just getting caught up in some of my gripes. If this is your kind of music and you like to croon with your buds, this is a great time that anyone can jump into and those who are dedicated to sticking around can master.   However, I can't recommend the EyeToy enough. Some of the songs are a bit on the older side and came to be before MTV made videos mandatory. Thus, unless you want some grainy concert footage as your performance backdrop, the EyeToy is the way to go. The device only makes the game better as you watch the performances on screen with the option for effects and the ever present chance for a Golden Moment -- an EyeToy logo pops up on some of the timing bars and the device records a few seconds of you belting out the tune sans the backup music that you can then watch when all is said and done.   When your rockfest is done, your score is broken down by the number of notes you nailed, and if you score well enough, you're added to the ranked list along with an optional EyeToy photo. SingStar is out to be a fun and engaging multiplayer karaoke game, and it succeeds at that. If you've got a crew of buddies that's in the mood to scream Audioslave and try to keep up with the Ramones, this is the title for you -- everything that's in this game is available for you and your friends as soon as you unwrap the plastic. However, if you're looking for something that will keep you playing when your friends head home, this iteration of SingStar might not have the shelf life you're looking for -- unless besting your own high scores is where it's at for you.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
