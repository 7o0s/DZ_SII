Chicken Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/04/egg-vs-chicken-review", "text": "Casual PC games -- some of the best-selling games in the industry -- are a perfect match for mobile. Each category strives to make games with accessible mechanics, clever concepts, and addictive game play. Konami's agreement with one of the casual landscape's leading names, PlayFirst, has resulted in a handful of mobile conversions, including Egg Vs. Chicken. Egg Vs. Chicken offers an action-puzzle take on the age old question of who came first; but in this game, the deck really seems stacked in the eggs' favor.   You take control of a field of eggs. You must slide the eggs into groups of three or more so you can launch them out of the field and into the incoming waves of chickens. There are eight different chickens that want to peck their way into the egg field, including itty-bitty chicks, motherly hens, and juicy roasters. At first, the chickens move slowly -- but as you work your way through the five different time periods, the fowl pick up the pace.   You must move the egg clusters to edges of the field with arrows that point out toward the approaching encroachers. Once a grouping of three or more is in position, you can double-click on it to fire them off. In later levels, you must get large groupings on arrows pointing in different directions, as the chickens will try to flank you. You must nail large combos of defeated chickens to create time eggs. You must satisfy the required number of time eggs to move on to the next stage.   There are many different egg types, each with different powers like the incinerating red eggs or freezing blue eggs. When you defeat chickens, they leave behind new eggs that shortly join those left in your field. Moving the eggs around the screen is easy, thanks to very simple controls -- but you'll have to think about how you want to scoot the shells so as not to break up potentially huge clusters.   There are two play modes in Egg. When you finish a time zone in the story mode, you can replay it for time in the challenge mode. There are over 50 levels, so there seems to be no shortage of play in Egg -- but that all depends on whether or not you're enjoying yourself. Personally, my interest in Egg started to fizzle in only the second time zone. I kept at it to see what would come next so I could make a fair assessment, but the game never really recaptured my curiosity.   Egg Vs. Chicken benefits from a fun premise and I liked the time zone concept for introducing new backdrops and story elements. I played the game on an LG VX8600. The handset has large, crisp screen -- but the small chicken sprites didn't look very good on it. The game is loaded with chicken/egg humor, like calling a large cluster of eggs ~clucktacular.~  I think a good number of gamers will understand what I mean when I say that Egg Vs. Chicken is a decent game with merits, but it just wasn't the game for me. The puzzle play didn't grab me right away like Oasis or Diner Dash. If you like the PC game, this is a good mobile replica. But there are better casual-to-mobile games out there.", "date": "Jan 4, 2007"}
