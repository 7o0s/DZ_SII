{"name": "Urban Champion", "name_review": "Urban Champion-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/urban-champion-e", "text": "is an e-Reader version of probably one of the least-known of the Nintendo Entertainment System's launch line-up of games. To play this lost ~classic,~ you'll need an e-Reader peripheral to scan in the game's five different trading cards, two codes per card.  In this very early Street Fighter-style game, one player dukes it out with another fighter, punching high or low with strong or weak punches, trying to force the other person off the edge of the screen. As the fight moves on, players will have to dodge pots dropped from windows above the street...and if the fight goes on too long, the cops will show up and take away the person who's closer to the edge of their side of the screen. The fight ends when your stamina hits zero, or the fighter is knocked down into the sewer three screens over.  The game is honestly not much more than what Nintendo did for the ~Boxing~ mini-game in Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance. There's very little strategy involved, and without the original game's two-player mode enabled (the e-Reader version has the two-player Vs. mode taken out, for technical reasons) it's just not a whole lot of lasting fun fighting the same computer AI opponent over and over. It's a nice idea, but it's not surprising that the game wasn't a huge hit. It's worth enabling the Parental Controls on your Wii system just to guard against the possibility of your friends taking hold of the controller and wasting 500 Points on this download while you're off and away from the living room. Urban Champion's design was fine as a Game & Watch handheld in 1984, but taken to the NES it was just too shallow. Its two-player mode adds just an ounce of redeeming value, but even that becomes a simple button-mashing contest. No, there's no reason at all to pick up UC on the VC. Unless you're over at a friend's house and want to play a joke by downloading it, while he's off and away from the living room.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
