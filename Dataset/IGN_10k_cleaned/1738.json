What it something I said? Did I do something years ago that's coming to haunt me? Don't be frightened  it goes back a little farther than that. Unlike Japan, a country which fosters consoles quicker than fertility pills in the Midwest, Korea is a country that has taken to the PC for most of its gaming. There gaming halls are filled with LAN equipped PCs for Starcraft tournaments or Red Alert battles, and kids at home play are much more likely to pick up a keyboard for gaming than your average Japanese kid. Where does the Japanese connection come in, then? Simple  while PCs are the rage, the overpowering surge of Japanese products, from videogames to Hello Kitty merchandise, still has a huge influence  as does a certain subgenre of dance games that has filled the arcades in Korea. So what better option than to make a dancing game for your... PC? It makes perfect sense in Korea. In America, however, where Dance Dance Revolution is finally hitting our shores with a PS2 version, the whole dancing-pad thing is a bit perplexing.  Either way, Cyber Groove is here, a PC ripoff of Dance Dance Revolution if we've ever seen one. If you can find it in stores (supplies are low, and stores that carry Cyber Groove are few), you'll instantly recognize it by the insanely colored, oversized box with the day glo lettering. It comes with a USB pad, complete with little Velcro thingies to prevent slipping, and the game. Everything you need to begin sweatin' to the goldies. After you've installed the game, as well as the pad  which shows up as ~Happy Boy~ on your peripherals list oddly enough  -- you'll be treated to a loud loud loud start screen, with only a few options to getting your butt in action.  The best thing about Cyber Groove is that you've got a lot of choices in how you customize your game  not only are there a huge range of difficulty levels to choose from, there are whole sets of songs within those difficulties to mess around with. You can set up a second pad and play against a friend, or if you're really feeling Flashdance, you can even set up a game that plays on both pads. A surefire way to find out if you're in shape, or possibly prone to hard attacks. Did you know that some girl in San Jose lost 58 pounds by playing Dance Dance every morning before school? I made that up,  but I heard it somewhere, and besides, it could happen.  But back to the Groove. You play the game by watching the arrows as they move up the screen. As they match up with their respective icons, you've got to press the appropriate arrow on your pad. It sounds pretty easy, especially if you're used to dancing... only this isn't so much dancing. Check out our movie, and you'll see a certain Riverdance stepping style prevailing over the game, as opposed to butt-bumping, rump-thumping that you'd probably expect. It can be a little awkward, but after a while you'll learn to anticipate the actions, and actually start having fun as you survive some speedier moments of a song, or a complicated set of combinations that has you pressing multiple directions at once.  I brought in an expert to give this one a try  a certain Dave Smith from IGN PSX that does a certain Dance Dance routine on expert mode nearly every day after work. While he made it through the songs fairly well, he had problems with the pad, particularly the sensitivity and the range that it reacts to. While the USB connection is a great choice, and while it's neat that the developers have opted to add diagonal buttons to the pad, I wish that it just reacted better to your movements. The pad's essential to you getting farther in the game, and overall I felt that the dance pad just seemed inconsistent when you were playing through a level. While this is a complaint I have against most dance pads, It's also pretty damn hard not to lose your place on the pad during a song, especially since there aren't any ridges, or texture differences to help you figure out your position. And believe me, you aren't going to have time to look, either.  It's hard not to judge a music game by the music, because it affects your total experience, from the variety of the dancing you do to your general enjoyment of the game. That being said, if this game was accompanied by say, a full collection of Massive Attack tunes, or maybe some Daft Punk, this would be a fun musical ride for you and your friends. Unfortunately it's not, however, and instead you're stuck with some creepy German techno dance hits apparently sung by chipmunks girls sounding like chipmunks, some J-pop favorites, and a couple of very odd choices like the Village People's Macho Man. It's not to want to slit your wrists after listening to ~Cartoon Heroes~ for the fifth time, even if you are getting to Expert status at the end. I doubt most console gamers will be able to stomach many of the tunes, and I seriously doubt most PC gamers will be able to take them much better.  As for the graphics, it's an up and down affair. Cyber Groove does a good job of spicing up the songs by having a fully polygonal character (man, woman, polar bear  they're all represented) dance some pretty amazing dance routines to the song. The detail on the characters is nice, and it looks like the developers have done some pretty solid motion capture work to make their movements authentic.  The backgrounds are nothing less than atrocious though, and make the Liberace mini-mall and museum in Las Vegas look like a night at the Bellagio. God awful colors, hideous colors, and tacky patterns cause you more distress than enjoyment in the long run. I know that Cyber Groove is just trying to ape the look and feel of Dance Dance, but that doesn't make it right. The menu systems aren't much better, especially the horrible loading screen. On an unrelated note, what's up with the exit option? Unless you read through the manual, you'll never figure out that the way to quit out of the game is through the often-used and commonly-implemented ~0~ key on your numeric keypad. Sounds logical.  Despite the fact that the female announcer is great in that Monster Truck Rally kind of way, and despite some fun initial gameplay, Cyber Groove is a fish out of water here on the PC. Most music games would have trouble finding acceptance, or at the very least people with open pocketbooks on the computer, and a shakier piece of work like Cyber Groove is in an even worse situation. If you're in the mood for something to keep you musically entertained, I suggest you take out your Melvins album and try banging your head against the wall in time with the base drum instead.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
