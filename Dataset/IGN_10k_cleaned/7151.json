The blue blur's first Genesis adventure was a sensation on cells -- especially in Europe -- offering an impressive recreation of the classic platformer for numbthumbing mobile gamers. Following up on Sonic's mobile momentum, Sega Mobile has released Sonic Jump, a simplified hop-and-jump platformer that works the Y-axis across six stages based on recognizable areas from the 16-bit games, such as Blue Sky.   Players must send Sonic up these vertical levels, primarily controlling his left and right movements, as the 'hog jumps automatically whenever he touches a platform. Sonic collects rings as he hops up the stages, holding on to them for his own survival -- every time Sonic touches an enemy, such as the robot animals in Dr. Eggman's army, he loses rings. When Sonic finally out of rings, he falls from the screen.   Propelling Sonic up the screen is a one-way affair. You cannot drop back down the level; once a platform has disappeared from view, it's gone. If Sonic hits the bottom of the empty screen, he perishes. Some platforms fall apart after Sonic lands on them once, others bounce him even higher, others offer bonuses just for landing on them and moving through the glowing circle hovering directly above. At the top of each stage, Sonic must confront Dr. Eggman in a simple boss battle. To defeat Eggman, you just have to avoid his attacks while bumping into him and jumping through the air.   Unfortunately, though, Sonic Jump just is not an engaging game -- actually, it's quite dull. There are six stages, but I found myself pushing through them toward the end out of obligation more than anything. The controls seemed sluggish and occasionally inaccurate -- I tested the game on an LG VX8000, perhaps your mileage may vary on a different handset, but the 8000 is not known for being a bad game-playing handset. I can imagine that some gamers might be frustrated with a lack of checkpoints. If you fall off the screen near the top of the stage, you must start all the way back at the bottom. That certainly gives the game a little more longevity, but it remains to be seen how much longevity the game really needs.   Sonic Jump looks like it was cut from the same cloth as other games in the series -- but more from the section of fabric that's getting threadbare. The stages are properly decorated for fans to recognize (what self-respecting gamer doesn't know the color palette of the Green Hill Zone?), but they're not terribly detailed. Character sprites are small too and that can make some precision jumps difficult to pull off, especially when extending to grab some out-of-the-way rings.  Sonic Jump isn't the hedgehog game you've been looking for. Fans of the Sega mascot are better served by just downloading the real-deal platformer or waiting for the sequel, which should launch in the not too distant future. I understand Sega Mobile's desire to use a recognizable character to sell downloads, but a mediocre game like this is detrimental for the brand and a disservice to hardcore Sonic fans. Zzzz.
