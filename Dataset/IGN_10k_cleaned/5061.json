And since every major movie release must now be accompanied a mobile game, the exploits of a suburban superhero clan are now readily available on your handset in the new Disney and Lavastorm Engineering game The Incredibles. Does The Incredibles managed to break the mediocrity barrier that plagues most movie games?   Features:   Play as Mr. Incredible or Elastigirl  Three environments: jungle, city, secret lair   Lavastorm really could have taken a shortcut and delivered your basic run and jump platformer, but thankfully, the developer understands that wireless audiences are slowly becoming a little more discriminating with how they spend their download dollars. While there is certainly plenty of running and jumping, The Incredibles attempts to shake things up by allowing the gamer not only to play as both Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, but to use them together -- on the same screen -- to accomplish a multitude of platformer-style puzzles.   Both of the incredible 'rents possess spectacular superhero talents that must be used in tandem. Mr. Incredible wields outrageous strength while his wife can stretch her limbs to bop enemies or objects from a great distance. Both heroes are usually on screen at the same time -- neither gets that far ahead of the other without requiring you to play catch-up to solve a multi-pronged problem.   For example, you may need to stand on a switch to fire up a floating platform to cross a gap. However, the platform is only active as long as somebody stands on the switch. So, you must get Elastigirl up to the switch to start it, use Mr. Incredible to cross and grab a boulder, then return to the switch, drop the boulder on it and allow both characters to cross.   This kind of co-op play is actually pretty slick to see in a mobile game. It's not revolutionary by any stretch, but it's certainly a step forward for movie-licensed games. Both Disney and Lavastorm know they could have just released a so-so jumper starring a dude in a red unitard, slapped The Incredibles on the title screen, and sold a boatload.   The Incredibles face off against a variety of enemies, all under the control of Syndrome, the fam's arch-nemesis. There are plenty of robots and guards to hurl boulders at or punch. There are also boss encounters with Omnidroids, large full-screen 'bots that require you to find and exploit their weak spots.   We were able to test the game on an N-Gage QD, and suspect the game benefited from having a comfortable, convenient video game button layout, complete with d-pad. With so much precision jumping, results may vary on sloppier touch pads.   The Incredibles looks impressive for a mobile title -- nearing Game Boy territory. At least, a third-party Game Boy game. The game's visuals are bright and colorful, and in a huge jump from most movie games, the main characters are readily recognizable. These aren't just blah sprites in red uniforms, they retain the correct physiques and features. The levels are detailed and large, even if there aren't too terribly many of them.I really enjoyed The Incredibles. The game manages to remain more faithful to its subject matter -- and treat it with more respect -- than many of the movie-licensed game I've played on consoles over the last several years. (And I have played some crap-tacular movie games.)My two caveats are that the game is somewhat short and that even with the puzzle-solving elements, it's pretty easy.However, the cooperative-character game play is a good way to raise The Incredibles above its basic platformer roots: running, jumping, and robot-smacking.", "date": "Oct 3, 2004"}
