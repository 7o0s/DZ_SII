And it's also a fact that none of the Simpsons games so far have been worth their weight in flat meat. Thankfully, this latest Simpsons game, from Radical and Vivendi seems to break this curse by offering up a title that maintains continuity with the license and presents a game model that's enjoyable enough to justify our interest. If you needed further proof of the worth of the game, consider why it's the only of the recent Simpsons titles to make its way to the PC.  The Simpsons Hit and Run follows the tradition of lesser Simpsons games in that it takes a gaming model already popularized by other titles and liberally slathers a generous helping of Simpsons style all over it. In this case Rockstar's megahit Grand Theft Auto serves as the basis for the gameplay. A series of missions allows the players to experience a fairly involved story, beginning first with Homer before moving on to play as Bart, Lisa, Marge and Apu. In fine Grand Theft Auto tradition, there are numerous side missions to be found around Springfield and plenty of secrets for those who can find their way to the game's more inaccessible areas.  Concerned parents needn't worry as the more gratuitous action of Grand Theft Auto has been scaled back a bit, but there's still plenty of carnage and crashing to be found here. There are no weapons, for instance. Character attacks are limited to simply kicks (and the occasional hit and run, natch) so you won't be torching the power plant employees with your trusty flamethrower or clearing the lines at the Googleplex with a deadly chaingun. As with Grand Theft Auto, there are consequences for recklessness. A handy meter lets you see how concerned Springfield's finest are about your actions. Run over too many pedestrians or crush too many mailboxes and the cops will start hunting you down with a vengeance.  Since Grand Theft Auto is a franchise we're already quite familiar with, what makes the game initially so compelling is the brilliant use of the license. The project was overseen by Matt Groening and the Gracie Films crew and the fidelity of nearly every aspect of the game is simply overwhelming. With a cast and continuity as large and complex as that of The Simpsons, consistency is a hard target to hit. Thankfully, with the exception of Bart and Lisa driving around town, very little in The Simpsons Hit and Run seems at all out of place with the show.  The overall story involves finding mechanical bees equipped with security cameras. It's a bit out of place and clearly stands out as a gimmick included for the sake of the game. Thankfully the overall conspiracy behind these bees and their presence in Springfield is tied in with more palatable story elements but for the most part, they only serve to remind you that you're playing a game.  Weirdly, the dialogue itself also continues to remind you that you're playing a game. From the start of the tutorial, the characters make frequent asides that reveal they're aware that they are in a game. This self-awareness helps to increase the humor of the game as the characters mock the very activities you're asked to take part in. In all, it's a lot like the hip cynicism of Rocky and Bullwinkle and the wall between the characters and player is acknowledged with just the right tone and balance.   Rather than presenting a single city for the player to roam in, Hit and Run divides Springfield up into a few distinct, separate areas. Each character has their own stomping ground here and since the geography of the show is intentionally indistinct, I'm really surprised that the developers managed to put the various buildings together in a believable way. The Krusty Burger is next to the Noiseland Arcade which is next to the Android's Dungeon. Fat Tony's Legitimate Businessmens' Social Club is down the street from Moe's Bar. These touches really bring the world of Springfield to life and you'll start to get a sense of where things are in relation to each other as you drive through the levels.      When you're not driving at breakneck speeds through the Squid Port or tearing through a tomacco field, you'll find yourself progressing on foot. At this point, Hit and Run seems much more like a platform game with numerous (and often maddening) jumping puzzles and lots of interiors to explore. Coin collecting and bee killing are key points of this type of play but you'll also need to go on foot to purchase new cars -- like the Plow King or school bus, for instance -- and buy new outfits for your characters.  The pedestrian camera also causes a few problems. Having the camera off angle results in many a misstep in this game. The camera manages to snag on numerous objects in the environment. In the tighter spaces (like those found indoors, for instance), you can find the camera locked into a very narrow range of movement as it bumps against the walls. In addition to offering keyboard controls for mouse movement, the game also makes use of an optional mouse-controlled camera in pedestrian mode. It makes the platforming elements a bit easier to manage and even allows you the chance to look up and appreciate some of the taller gags in the game.  On the subject of bumping into walls, the collisions in the game aren't quite as realistic as they could be. It's not that the amount of damage sustained in crashes isn't realistic; it's that the actual connection between your car and the objects in the environment is, at times, somewhat unintuitive. Worse still, you can occasionally find yourself stuck in those awful Austin Powers-like situations where your car is eternally wedged between two objects. This even happens to AI drivers from time to time, so at least I'm not alone in my misery.  Though the game's graphics are adequate, it's still an absolute mystery to me why the developers didn't opt for a cel-shaded approach. As Doug said in the PS2 review, if any game in the history of gaming ought to have been cel-shaded, it's this one. Seeing the characters rendered in full 3D complete with shading disconnects the game from the show more severely than any other gameplay-related compromise. The spikes on Lisa's hair shouldn't have depth and they certainly shouldn't be shaded.  Still, the details are quite nice. Each character is rendered according to the show's model sheets and the locations are spot on. You'll find some modest particle effects in the game, like when cars are destroyed for instance but for the most part, the effects are kept to a minimum. They might be able to pass of the smoke effects as intentionally cartoony, of course, but it still seems below what we'd expect from games these days.  And though I have mixed feelings about the sound, they're far less divided. For the most part, the sound in the game is superb. Each of the show's actors delivers performances here and the authenticity does a lot to reinforce the consistency of the game. The dialogue (also written by the show's writers) is dead on. Hearing Homer cry, ~Great, I've dropped my kabob,~ after a particularly nasty crash makes the whole experience work for me.   The show's theme is endlessly reworked here and, while it's a great theme, capable of surviving lots of interpretations, it does tend to get a bit stale by the end of the experience. Thankfully, there are other snatches of tunes here and there to break up the monotony. In terms of sound effects, the game does a good enough job of preserving the feel of the show but it's definitely the weakest of the three legs of the sound stool here. Now that's a spicy metaphor. Though it's undeniably the perfect game for Simpsons fans, it's not the perfect game. A few shortcuts have been taken in terms of polish and veterans of Grand Theft Auto won't find that the title holds much surprise beyond the use of the license. The license itself is a damn compelling argument in favor of the game, with the strength of the argument being proportional to your love of the series. Since we love the series, that's a no brainer. Still the ~been there, done that~ style of gameplay means that the game seems somewhat predictable.The few changes they've made are smart. The decision to lighten up the Grand Theft Auto mechanic is definitely welcome. Though the addition of weapons would add lots more action to the game, such a decision is totally at odds with the franchise. So, though there's a generous helping of mayhem in the series, it's much more teen-oriented than Rockstar's crime simulator. It's safe therefore for younger fans of the show", "date": "Nov 13, 2003"}
