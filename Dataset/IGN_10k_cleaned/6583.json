But a brash personality attracts attention, which is why Abandon reached out and licensed the athlete for their new ski racer, Bode Miller Alpine Racing.   Even though it does not have an Olympic license, there's no way around the fact that Abandon is releasing Bode Miller Alpine Racing now to capitalize on Torino fever. Who can blame them? Considering the current deck set-ups, you have to get those eyes by any means possible. But Abandon's intro sequences and the ability to choose representative countries is not a bad recreation of an Olympic-licensed game.    Alpine Racing instead aims to capture the action at the World Cup Skiing championship, dividing the play into three different categories: Downhill, Super-G, and Slalom. With each advancing mode, the game ramps up the difficulty. Downhill is a simple racing game that lets you enjoy some immediate action as well as get used to the basics of the game, such as turning and tucking (more on this in a moment). There aren't many obstacles in Downhill, so the main thrust of the game is gathering speed. Super-G throws a few more gates into the mix, and offers a middle ground between Downhill and Slalom. Slalom is the hardest part of the game, where you must navigate through a course full of gates. You need to have the turning mechanics down firm to make a decent showing in Slalom.   Tucking is Alpine Racing's primary mechanic. You begin each race with a supply of energy that allows you to tuck your body and gain extra speed. When your energy meter runs dry, you have to make do with regular speed until the meter regenerates. Tucking in whenever the course goes straight downhill will obviously give you the fullest boost, but you cannot just fly by gates and hope your extra speed makes up for the time penalties incurred by skipping gates. When to use tucking on the Downhill runs is fairly obvious, but on the more gate-intensive courses, such as Slalom, you can only use it when gates are lined up -- or just before the finish line, so you can grab some extra headway.   One of the things that surprised me about Alpine Racing was the amount of content. Each event has four individual tracks that are not repeated in any other game mode. And even though each track has the same look -- white snow, green trees, etc. -- but the position of gates, obstacles, and such are indeed quite different. There are also several sets of skis you can try out, such as Carvaholic and Freeride, with different ratings. Some are better for speed, others for turns. I liked that each set of skis really does feel a little different during game play and that they aren't just there to create a false illusion   Control is key in a game like this, and at times, I confess that I became a little frustrated with Alpine Racing. It may be a game of finesse, but the ease of over-steering does annoy from time to time. Maybe it's because of the top-down view, but I had an easier time controller my skier in the Downhill Skiing mini-game from I-play Torino 2006. Choosing the proper skis does help a bit, though, so I encourage people that do download it to fiddle with their options to find a good fit.  Bode Miller Alpine Racing is a decent winter-themed racing game that should enjoy the extra exposure from the Olympics. Fans of skiing will likely want to give this game a crack and try their own runs down the 12 provided courses. I did like the number of runs and the extra skis -- that showed effort. Some of the controls frustrated me, though, and in the end I felt like I was only having a pretty good time with the game instead of truly enjoying it. Your mileage may vary.", "date": "Jan 31, 2006"}
