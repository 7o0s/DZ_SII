Characters swarm around in the background and foreground, elements of the environment twist, turn and constantly rotate, the whole thing moves at a lightning pace -- it can be an overload for your eyes. Then you remember that it's a game made by Treasure, and all the madness suddenly makes sense.   Treasure's a company known for its chaos. It's a developer with action and shooter games as its most notable achievements. Gunstar Heroes came from Treasure, as did Ikaruga and Gradius V. Dynamite Headdy is similar to those titles in presentation, pacing and overall feel. The difference is it's not a shooter design -- it's a platformer starring a puppet with a detachable head.   Or detachable head(s), plural, as there ends up being about 15 different kinds. Headdy's out to defeat the evil forces of the malicious marionette Dark Demon, and to make his way to the final confrontation with the overlord he has to master each of the many interchangeable noggins -- like the wealth of different masks in Kid Chameleon or the multiple, distinctive power-ups in Mario's Mushroom Kingdom, each of Headdy's heads is unique and serves a particular purpose.   There's the Slammer Head that doubles the damage dealt by Headdy's headbutts. There's the Super Head that increases his speed, attack range and jumping height. There's the Pig Head that equips him with a heat-seeking star rifle, and many, many more. You'll find power-ups that shrink Headdy, give him the power to wall-jump, let him set off screen-clearing explosions and even make him fall asleep to recover health. It's a lot to wrap your head around.   And you're not given a whole lot of time to process it all, really, as the action comes in quick and fast. Dynamite Headdy is odd and a bit off-putting in that its gameplay often feels a bit too fast and frantic. It's like you're not really playing at all, sometimes, but rather that you're just getting dragged along as a slightly interactive piece of a pre-scripted performance -- case in point, the game's opening level, which sees Headdy running constantly to the right side of the screen along a rollercoaster track and ends itself before you even realize you're not still watching an opening cinematic.   The game is at its best when it takes a break to breathe, giving you full control over Headdy and putting you into explorable levels that aren't forcibly scrolled. Then you get the chance to pause a moment and appreciate what you're seeing, as well as take advantage of some of Headdy's other abilities like being able to slingshot himself up and onto higher platforms by grabbing a hold of smiling ~HangMan~ orbs. The breakdown is about 50/50 in the end. Half the time you're able to proceed at your own pace, and the other half you've got to keep up with the speed the game throws at you. If you're up for the challenge and don't mind a bit of madness, Dynamite Headdy could be a good pick for youEstablished Treasure fans will be those most satisfied with Dynamite -- especially those fans who've stuck with the company even through its other odd platformers, like Mischief Makers and Wario World. But Headdy can't come out on top over the developer's other major Genesis release, Gunstar Heroes, which we'd still recommend as the better first purchase for players unfamiliar with Treasure's style.", "date": "Aug 2, 2007"}
