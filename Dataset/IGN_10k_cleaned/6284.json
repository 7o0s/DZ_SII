When they seize control of a sprawling chemical plant to achieve that sinister end, three special operations soldiers and three innocent bystanders find themselves caught in the clasp of terror itself.    The idea behind Capcom and Circle Studio's Without Warning is a good one. Like 24, the game sets a frantic pace and follows several specialized and differently equipped people as they rush in desperation through a time sensitive adventure against overwhelming odds. Switching between characters and giving players uniquely varied insight into the game's story is a critical component of Without Warning. Sadly, this idea does not workout nearly as well as hoped.  Games with dramatic aspirations and visions of suspenseful 24-inspired grandeur must craft compelling storylines. Without Warning, especially, needed engaging conversations, clear and suspenseful objectives, sudden twists and eventful missions. This is because more than most games, Without Warning uses its complex structure and multi-sided story to hook players. There are six perspectives and missions that play over the same timeframes only from different vantage points. If any of that is going to be successful or add to the overall experience, the fiction that runs times six must go someplace wonderful. But it just doesn't.  Alright, where's my camera?  Character switching in Without Warning is intended to grant players access to different perspectives on situations they've already experienced from other angles. At X o'clock, for example, the secretary might try and open a door, but be confronted by an enemy who suddenly dies because one mission ago we killed that person as a different character and also at precisely X o'clock. That's the general idea, anyway.  While creating the potential for some very exciting situations and character swaps, this actually creates a serious amount of repetition. We constantly hear the same things, see many of the same things, move through the same dreary industrialized levels, and perform similar tasks to unlock paths we've already ventured through as other characters. Moreover, the time repeat system isn't very exact, meaning what you did will never be recreated perfectly.  Had the voice work not been of such poor quality, the mission objectives not been so classically mundane (douse fire, unlock door, circumvent obstacle), and the pacing been much more invigorating, we'd be on the right path to appreciating the six-way play. This, of course, assumes Circle also tightened up the in-between mission segments, specifically axing the unnecessary report cards and pre-mission text briefings. Given that we're seeing a story from six perspectives with much repetition, shouldn't we be able to know what's going on at any moment without constant explanatory updates between five minute levels? Furthermore, the inclusion of start and stop missions segmented by status reports diminishes the sense of flow and cohesion, and so the game takes on a mysteriously disjointed form even though it tried so valiantly to do the just the opposite.  The six characters also allow Circle to create disparate types of gameplay, but there too Without Warning falls short. The three special ops dudes and the security guard play too similarly despite the random allocation of bomb and lock mini-games. And they all adhere to the same consistent illogical issues that sprout up, like not being able to equip the dropped weapons of enemies or facing off against suicidal terrorists that can't differentiate between cover that does and does not exist. The cameraman is more about filming and the secretary is more about haphazardly sneaking through levels than the others are about shooting, but all six feature similar sorts of inexplicable polishing issues Without Warning never manages to escape from.   Even given the faults of each play type and the game's failure to combine them into an experience worth investment, if the combat were at all exciting, given that it makes up most of the game, we'd be inclined to at least deal with some of the other glaring faults. But again, like in so many other areas, Without Warning features a technically deficient and plodding type of action plagued by twitchy camerawork, limited functionality, a spastic lock-on system and an unprecedented amount of crates and explosive barrels. Further, enemies have a twisted tendency of rematerializing from behind an array of locked doors that lead to blank rooms, making the always small and usually clear levels feel like doorways to unending legions of terrorists.   And as the game continues, these many problems and shortcomings only worsen, eventually climaxing with a fizzle tied directly into the storyline that simply never peaks. Without Warning really isn't very good... Its shooting is tame, forward progress is tedious, most enemies are foolish, the environment is dreary, and the unprofessionally delivered storyline is predictable and quite unentertaining. But perhaps Without Warning's biggest problem is the gimmicky multi perspective system it employs to distinguish itself from other action titles. Despite being conceptually sound, six kinds of the same uninteresting story and gameplay isn't at all satisfying.", "date": "Nov 5, 2005"}
