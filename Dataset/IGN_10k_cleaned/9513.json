Not anymore, at least. Not since he found an alien artifact called the Omnitrix. It's an out-of-this-world, high-tech wristwatch which fell out of the sky and into Ben's accidental possession  and, also accidentally, transformed him into a makeshift superhero. Now he's living a double life, as both a normal, everyday 10-year-old boy, but also as the shapeshifting, split-personalitied Ben 10. Ben 10: Protector of Earth is the first video game to attempt an adaptation of this popular Cartoon Network franchise, and it does a solid job. Which should be a sigh of relief for fans of the series, because this is one character that certainly must have been a challenge to faithfully translate.    Because Ben's double life isn't just a double. Or a triple, or quadruple. Ben's dealing instead with upwards of 20 different personalities and alternate alien forms in the cartoon show, and it's kind of a mess to try to keep track of them all. The titular numeral refers to his original set of 10 transformations  the Omnitrix on his arm, when activated, allowed him to assume the shape, abilities and psychological mentality of any of 10 different alien species. But as the series has progressed, he's gained more and more accessible alien forms to call upon, with new ones added with regular frequency.   That's good for whatever action figure company has the Ben 10 license, but daunting for a game designer to tackle  so, wisely, this first Ben 10 game chooses to focus on only a subset of Ben's best transformations. You'll find five altogether, in addition to Ben's normal human form. There's Heatblast, a pyrotechnic alien with the power to control fire and float for a short time. There's Fourarms, the heavy-hitting barbarian who will be your best option in major brawls with bunches of baddies.    The Omnitrix keeps a permanent residence on the touch screen, where it's easy to move your thumb over and quickly select between Ben's different transformations.  There's Cannonbolt, who looks like a yeti but rolls up like an armadillo, and Wildvine, the sentient plant monster who plays a bit like the Bionic Commando, and, finally, XLR8, the speedster who's by far the fastest and most mobile of them all.  It's a good group, and does a nice job representing the diversity of Ben's abilities  it's even up to date, as Cannonbolt and Wildvine are some of Ben's newer forms, while the other three were part of the original 10 set.   The game plays out as a side-scrolling action/platformer, with a brawling component introduced when enemies arrive on the scene. And it's an immediately satisfying balance  the touch screen displays an ever-present graphic of Ben's Omnitrix wristwatch, and you can spin the ring on it with your thumb to select any of Ben's different forms, at any time, and spontaneously morph into whichever form you think is best for the current situation. If you've got a long jump to clear, pick Heatblast  his floating firesled will gain you the extra distance. If you need to climb a sheer vertical wall, swap to Fourarms  his four massive hands have the strength to hold on where the other aliens can't. It's really quite a bit of fun to just watch Ben change shapes, back and forth, to whatever alien you want, whenever you want.   Well, it's not really whenever you want. Fans of the show are sure to know that the Omnitrix is notorious for failing Ben when he needs it most, and here in Protector of Earth it will often run out of energy at inopportune times as well  then forcibly shifting him back into his standard human shape. Collectible orbs of energy keep it powered up and active, but you still have to keep a careful eye on it. If you try to swap too quickly in the middle of an extended battle, for example, you might find yourself stranded for several seconds as human Ben while the watch reboots itself with a fresh power charge.   The brawling engine here isn't perfect, and plays a little loose with hit detection on occasion  but most of the time it's playing loose in your favor, as certain animations Ben has make him immune to damage while they play out. And the level design seems a bit basic, too, most of the time  but interactive elements that work specifically with the Cannonbolt and Wildvine forms spice things up too. So overall, Ben 10: Protector of Earth's gameplay is satisfying and fun to play through. Running, jumping, transforming into different aliens and beating up bad guys. Exactly as it should be.   And the design is fleshed out a bit more beyond that with the inclusion of additional unlockable abilities for Ben  you'll earn points for successfully completing stages and those points can be spent in a store of sorts to purchase enhancements for any of Ben's five alien transformations. You can upgrade their offensive or defensive capabilities, expand the amount of time the form stays active before the Omnitrix runs out of juice, and get completely new moves that can then be called upon with button combinations. Heatblast's A Button + Y Button flamethrower is especially hot.  Ben 10: Protector of Earth could have gone really wrong, as its hero is one of the most scattered and diversely superpowered superheroes to have come along in years. But the team at developer 1st Playable Productions wisely chose to focus on only five of Ben's best transformations, which allows this action/platforming adventure to flow well and never feel too out of control. After playing this successful adaptation, it's easy to envision a sequel that would offer players the option to play as a different set of Ben's forms  perhaps some of the flight-capable ones, or the quick-swimming Ripjaw. The series just has a ton of potential, and it's encouraging to see that potential already being capitalized upon in this first franchise release.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
