So far the Xbox Live Arcade has already seen the release of great titles like Outpost Kaloki X and Geometry Wars Evolved, and now it's time to add another highly entertaining and unique title to the mix: Wik: The Fable of Souls. The game is also out on PC, though you'll find the Xbox 360 version is 10 dollars cheaper.   Trying to explain exactly what Wik is and how it plays is somewhat difficult if you've never played it yourself. So, before I launch into what will undoubtedly be a convoluted and confusing attempt at elucidation, let me just say that Wik is a lot of fun to play. It's one of those games that, despite its odd concept and gameplay, will allow you to totally get into a groove while playing and give you the feeling of being unstoppable. Every element of gameplay meshes well, and the responsive controls go a long way toward helping you through each of the game's stages.   Alright, so in the game you play as the frog-like Wik. The game progresses in a stage-by-stage fashion. Each stage is a self-contained 2D screen full of trees, moving platforms and rock formations. Your goal in each stage is to grab as many caterpillar-like Grubs as possible and feed them to Slotham, a hulking purple creature that lumbers along the bottom of each level. Grubs will randomly appear at different spots in a stage, so you'll need to jump or tongue-swing your way around to reach them. Once in their vicinity, you can suck up the Grubs and spit them at Slotham at which point they count as collected. Once you've collected enough, the stage is beaten and you can move on to the next.   If this hurts as much as it should, Wik isn't saying anything. That's the basic concept, though there are tons of variable in the equation. For instance, you can slow Slotham down by firing honey at his feet. You'll also be accosted by increasing amounts of deadly insects, some of which are poisonous and others destructible only by special methods. There will also be various power ups you can nab including coins, gems, screen clearing bombs and time manipulating icons. The slow time power-up is especially hilarious because it's accompanied by a pounding techno tracks that is totally at odds with the game's otherwise airy, ethereal music.   On an HD set in 720p, Wik looks sharp, though it is, of course, still an XBLA game. Still, it has an undeniably appealing visual style akin to the Oddworld titles back on PSOne. The game is mainly about controls, and after getting the hang of them you'll find the game pulls off what it's trying to do fairly well. Before long, you'll find yourself simultaneously tongue-swinging across a gap, shooting acorns at bugs carrying Grubs, and firing the Grub directly at Slotham before you even hit the ground.   Wik's nonsensical yet poetic story. There isn't any support for play over Xbox Live, but you can gather a few friends together to play local multiplayer games of tag, fire pit and plague. There's definitely plenty to do by yourself too, with over 120 story missions and numerous challenge modes (basically puzzle modes). There are a few bonus levels as well, including several variations of a Loopnastics mode that challenges you to perform midair circles with your tongue.   Like all the others, Wik has online leaderboards where you can check your scores against others. You'll also find a number of achievements you can aspire to attain, the majority of which are creatively designed and give you new goals to shoot for. Fans of quirky action-puzzle games will find a great gameplay experience in Wik, as will anyone looking for something unique on the XBLA. Let's hope the XBLA will see the release of more of these kinds of quirky titles, and further expand the scope of the massive time sink that is the Xbox 360.", "date": "Dec 15, 2005"}
