{"name": "Echo Night", "name_review": "Echo Night", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/08/echo-night", "text": "Agetec (ASCII) has a solid reputation in Japan for publishing strongly story-led games that create credible, absorbing scenarios (the Clock Tower series, Armored Core, Shadow Tower, and so on). With the release of the sequel, Echo Night 2, in Japan, Agetec has brought the first game over this side of the Pacific to try and capture the imaginations of US gamers.  Gameplay  Just like our Arnie in the movie True Lies, Henry Osmond lives a double life. There's more to him than you might first expect. Apparently an artist, Henry is in fact a hotshot demon catcher whose untimely disappearance jump-starts the game and gives young Richard Osmond, the star of the show, something to investigate. Visiting the burned out wreck of his father's house, Richard comes across a mysterious book -- and this discovery jettisons him back into the past for the first of his super-sleuthing time-travels.   Game control in Echo Night is a bit like Myst, only vastly more  interactive. Played from a first-person perspective, you manipulate a  floating star-shaped cursor to scope out your surroundings. Anything of  interest causes this star to turn bright blue, which is your cue to use  one of the controller buttons to either investigate it, pick it up, use  it, or talk to it. So far, so good, but  some items have a bit more up their sleeves, as it were. Examine certain paintings  and books, for instance, and that time-travel I just mentioned kicks in.  When you're hot on the trail of a mystery, there's no substitute for  visiting the scene of the crime, and that's just what happens as you're  spirited away to events that occurred in the past and which hold clues  to solving the puzzle. An atmosphere-laden cut scene, relatively  seamless as it uses the game engine, helps keep the cohesion as this  journey takes place. These transitions are frequent, and may seem  annoying to less patient gamers, but do much to enhance the feel of the  game.   It's not long before you're aboard the luxury liner Orpheus, constructed  to transport the Rockwell family and select guests. As soon as you  board, you meet the ghostly captain of the ship who takes you to a room  and instructs you not to leave it, on any account. This is an ominous  beginning, because you know that to make any progress at all, you  absolutely must leave that room. This immediately creates a sense of  foreboding that never really lets up. On entering any new  area, or space, the first thing you must do is locate the light switch,  to ward off the spirits -- especially the evil floating girl -- and you  have to do it fast! If you're too slow, she'll attack, and I'm sorry to  say you're no match for her powers. The force is strong with this one.  This, then, is how things continue, as you ransack the passenger liner  in pursuit of the truth. Along the way, countless other spirits cross  your path and it's the interaction with these apparitions that forms the  most part of the game. There are the expected puzzles (and many of them  are very good ones), the constant threat of attack from the spirits  inclined to evil, and in the end everything you've seen and done begins  to piece together and make sense. But we're not going to spoil that for  you.  Graphics With the phenomenally powerful PlayStation 2 on its way, a lot of talk  in the industry is centered around gameplay. The concern is that we're  going to see an awful lot of all-bark-and-no-bite games for the new  console which boast flashy graphics and amazing special effects but fail  to deliver the essential gameplay that makes the thing fun. There are  more than enough examples of this with the current PlayStation -- bet  you've bought a few of them, too -- but Echo Night will never be placed in  this category. Many Western reviewers often fail to appreciate this, but  the fact is that the no-frills horror ~sound novel~ game is immensely  popular in Japan, since gamers there tend to look more for atmosphere  and storyline. Kamaitachi no Yoru (Night of the weasel's slash) on the  Super NES, for example, is cited by Japanese gamers, even today, as perhaps  the scariest and best horror game ever. Mediocre graphics my not enchant  most people, but the pay-off in the case of these games is the sense of  immersion and involvement they deliver.   Granted, there's no denying that the graphics in this game err on the side of nasty; not really due to any problems with clipping or models, as such, but rather with the low polygon counts and iffy textures. These textures are inconsistent -- some  are fine, others are so bad that it's difficult to tell exactly what  you're looking at sometimes, and even worse, it's hard to distinguish  some doors from the wall surrounding them. This is obviously not  desirable -- but it does at least mean load times are quick. The whole  feel here is that someone drew everything with a scratchy old ink pen in  a day or two and then went home. But to focus on this aspect is to miss  the point of Echo Night. So what if half the characters are represented  as gray silhouettes? That, after all, is a nod to tradition, not ease of  production, common in this type of game in Japan. They're ghosts -- you're lucky you can see them at all! What matters here is the experience the game delivers.  Sound The music composed by Tsukasa Saitoh and Cota Hoshino is excellent, with  just the right mix of expectancy and foreboding that creates a tangible  sense of tension. It's just a shame there's not more of it. Sound  effects are sparse but when they come, they fit right in. They sound  just like they should, from the rattle of the corpse-strewn train on the  tracks to the creepy creaking of the liner's wooden boards. Since Echo  tries to create this sense of the eerie and supernatural, you're not  going to have Rob Zombie yelling away in the background or any of the  high energy stuff favored by other publishers. Silence, when interspersed  with knocks, bangs, chimes, etc makes for a far more chilling  environment, and this is how Echo Night plays its hand. It's all very Zen.   Echo Night is a throwback to a lower-bit era when developers were more interested in how a game plays than how it looks. Rather than try and wow their audiences with graphical wizardry (which, in any case, wasn't technically possible), they attempted to deliver the kind of gaming experience that hooks the player, then lures them into the onscreen action. Despite its many deficiencies, this is exactly the effect Echo night achieves. As I played through the game, there were moments of real tension and excitement as I tried to attain certain objectives and it was always scary (but oddly amusing) to try and escape from the crazy floating child-doll thingy. The gaming experience is where Echo Night shines through. No-one will remember the graphics, and you might even forget the eerie soundtrack, but it'll be a while before you get that child out of your head. When you next fire up one of those all-style-no-substance crowd-pleasing games, a tear will form in your eye as you think of Echo Night. Look past the clunky game engine for a moment and soak up the ambience created onboard the good ship Orpheus. Go on, you could do worse.", "date": "Sep 8, 1999"}
