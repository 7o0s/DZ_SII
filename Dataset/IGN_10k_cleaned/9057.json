Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah Coded Arms Contagion. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.   Sigh.   No, you haven't stumbled upon an IGN copy editing mistake, I just couldn't think up a better way to introduce a game as mundane, as vanilla, as run-of-the-mill as Coded Arms Contagion from Konami. It's not a bad game or a broken game, but it is a completely sterile first-person shooter.   You'll play through 13 levels as Maj. Jacob Grant, a special agent trained in killing and computer hacking. Grant gets involved with an elite force set to test A.I.D.A., a government combat simulation program that has gobs of top secret data in it. Grant puts on a funny little headset and gets kicked into the virtual world of A.I.D.A.   So, yeah, it's The Matrix with a military spin.     Once Grant's in the Matr  er  A.I.D.A., his training exercise quickly deteriorates into a rescue mission that has him shooting constantly spawning bad guys, hacking computers and upgrading weapons.    All that sounds fun, and you can see where it could be. The controls are -- for the most part -- responsive. The face buttons change your POV, the nub moves Grant around the levels and the d-pad locks on, switches weapons and reloads. It's pretty much the same setup every FPS has on the PSP, and it makes for a solid enough experience. As I popped into new areas in A.I.D.A., I had no trouble locking on to the machine gun-packing bad guys, pumping them full of virtual lead and watching their bodies disappear in a cloud of green 0s and 1s.   My problem was when this process began to repeat level after extremely boring level.   All this title is running into different areas and blasting these bad guys. After a few rounds of generic, darkly dressed guards, pink crabs show up. Then, some blue crabs show up followed by guards in a redder look.   Perhaps the same ol' enemies wouldn't be such a bore if I wasn't running through the same ol' objectives. You enter an area, kill the enemies in front of you and hack a turret or a door to get to the next area and do the same thing again. Now, hacking a turret to turn it against its masters sounds nice, but there's no fun to it -- ~hacking~ consists of staring at two lines of numbers and picking the number that appears in both. Sometimes there will be up to three separate ~hacks~ to go through, but they all come down staring and having the basic ability to see pairs. Although this game and Die Hard with a Vengeance would lead you to believe differently, hacking is not this easy.   See this hallway? Watch it repeat for the rest of the game. The game tries to give you a reason to keep playing via Plugins -- weapons that you find in the levels and can then upgrade to make more powerful -- but it doesn't work. Coded Arms is very particular about when it'll let the next level of power be made available to your firearms, so expect to be ready for more bullets long before the title will give you the option of actually adding them.   So, your objectives suck (search the area), the enemies suck (lock-on and move to avoid getting hit while you fire away), the story's practically nonexistent (you're in A.I.D.A. to train for something somewhere and people are trying to steal the data inside A.I.D.A. that refers to stuff), and the upgrade system is no fun (not yet  not yet ). Is this one of those games where the multiplayer functionality saves the ho-hum single-player romp?   Nah.    Don't get me wrong, it tries. Coded Arms Contagion packs an ad-hoc mode and -- saints alive -- an infrastructure system. Both are ready to go for up to eight players and let you have at it on five maps with more than ten weapons (nova generators, lightning guns, etc.), but the gameplay just isn't there.   For starters, your single-player adventure is built around locking onto a foe. When you run into a pack of enemies you lock on to them one at a time and lay down your fire. When you get up to the mini-boss, tank-like guy, you lock on and circle him while using cover to avoid his mega-damage inflicting gun. However, when you jump into your first online game, you'll be alarmed to find that down on the d-pad does nothing.    Lock on is gone. Your go-to-control has been neutered in multiplayer.   So if I kill you, do you die in real life? Everyone else will be panicking just like you, and the switch will make for some lame firefights. The tiny crosshairs are hard to move quickly on your own, so brawls come down to folks running straight at you while unleashing their machine gun and hoping you stay in the center of their crosshairs or attackers running from side to side while spraying an array of projectiles in hopes of clipping you without opening themselves to attacks. Sounds like fun, eh?   Worse, the multiplayer levels seem even emptier than their single-player counterparts. I participated in a few rounds of team deathmatch this afternoon in The Pit -- a cotton candy-colored world of walkways and big, open areas -- and found myself severely underwhelmed. It was literally three other guys and myself spawning on the top floor, jumping to the ground floor and firing wildly at each other. Someone would die, and the whole process would start over.   Yay!I realize this was a harsh read, so I need to say -- again -- that Coded Arms Contagion isn't bad, it's just wholly uninspired. You'll never feel connected to the major (Does he die when he dies in A.I.D.A.?), the enemies (Are these real people or AI like Agent Smith?) or the game (Why am I playing this?). Games are supposed to layout the framework of a story and have you play to fill in the gaps, but Coded Arms unleashes you in a half-baked, story-less world and assumes you'll be happy going room-to-room shooting a bunch of bad guys as they appear for no real reason.", "date": "Sep 18, 2007"}
