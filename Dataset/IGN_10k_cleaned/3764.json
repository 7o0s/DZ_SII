The good news is that developer Akella's vision of pirate life (originally known as Sea Dogs II matches up very well with Disney's vision of piracy. The bad news is Johnny Depp is a no-show in the Xbox game, so we'll all still have to hold out hope that Donnie Brasco 2 will be made into a game for the home console.   Last year Bethesda published The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The fantasy-based RPG was well received despite several technical issues because it offered the depth and robust story that role-playing fans hadn't seen on Xbox to that point. Now in 2003, PotC's depth is maybe a notch or two below what was seen in Morrowind, it suffers from new combat and camera problems stemming from the third person perspective and nearly makes up for all of its shortcomings with outstanding sailing and ship-to-ship combat elements. Even if it doesn't tie into the film of the same name --and it doesn't-- Pirates of the Caribbean is a good step towards broadening the pirate-RPG category.  Gameplay  You're Captain Nathaniel  Hawk and you begin your adventure on land and sea in an archipelago full of Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, French and British colonists, not to mention bloodthirsty pirates. Your job is to interact with people to pick up missions and to pick up information, new weapons, crew members, money and ships for the purpose of completing those missions. Most towns have a port, a tavern, a general store and a shipyard that you can travel to in an instant using the quick travel feature on the Y button. Other towns and parts of an island colony may have other instant destinations like the governor's office or the harbormaster's quarters.  The initial stage of the game has you landing in the British colony of Oxbay where you learn basic commerce strategies, how to communicate with people and maybe even a little combat here and there. The on-land segments of PotC are in third person perspective and this is the area where the game runs into most of its problems.   Strategy Guide Available! Yarr!

Get the Guide | Video Review  The combat/control scheme is similar to Resident Evil (and nearly as slow) in that you have to press X to draw your character's sword and then attack with A, dodge with B and block with the left trigger. Granted this is an RPG where the focus is on developing your character not on the thrill of fighting action, but hand-to-hand combat is the main way of gaining experience points and therefore happens quite often. You don't have to go around chopping everybody's head off and earning a bad reputation, but an occasional scrap or two in between legitimate fights against pirates, soldiers or skeleton warriors is the only way to stay awake while playing Pirates of the Caribbean on land. With the awful collision detection between characters and buildings you can often end up fighting enemies around corners and through doorways without seeing them. You can fire your character's default pistol while his sword is drawn but the aiming is automatic and you'll have a split second to switch between highlighted targets as Nathaniel is pulling the trigger. He can earn more powerful and more efficient pistols but overall the 3rd person combat isn't strong enough to be such a critical part of the game.  Managing members of your party is limited to hooking them up equipment like swords and guns since they operate and fight on their own. They're only as good as their stats and attributes.  Hand in hand with the combat is the third person camera system that behaves inconsistently and can leave you in some extremely difficult situations. The game loads new environments as you enter and leave buildings and large areas and the camera often gets jammed up between structures and Nathaniel as it tries to stay locked unto the back of his head. At times like this the free camera control on the right analog stick can be inoperative and for split second or two the camera stays locked in place with Nathaniel walking around and operating just in front of it. During hectic combat situations and on any stairways, the camera will often betray you especially if you've got your full complement of three party members with you.  This is the pretty much the limit of what goes wrong in PotC. The character development system is very well done and helps bring the experience home. There are 10 attributes from Leadership all the way to Luck that will affect both your specific character and your entire ship when you hit the high seas. When hiring officers for your ship --this games equivalent of gaining new party members-- its wise to get guys who have skills that complement your own. You should build up your own Leadership, Melee and Commerce skills, but then be careful when you hire a First Mate, because he'll likely have high ratings in the same areas since First Mates want to eventually become captains. It may be better to hire a Cannoneer or Boatswain early on since their sailing skills like Repair and Defense will tighten up your lack of experience in those areas. However, down the road when you want to have more than one ship in your fleet, you'll want a skilled First Mate to captain your second ship so you don't have to worry about it. PotC does a great job with its personnel/party system in this way. You can only bring three officers with you at a time but you can have even more ~passengers~ waiting on your ship that can be called into to duty in an instant. You'll have to learn to balance having strong fighters at your side to help you win brawls with protecting valuable officers whom you'll need to be an effective captain on the sea. Your officers earn experience points as you earn them and you'll be in full control of their development as the game continues.       Money makes the world go 'round in this Disney Interactive title. You'll be sailing from island to island in PotC and trading commodities is a great way to earn money that you'll need to buy crew, officers, cannonballs, you name it. The game encourages you to ~double up~ on your missions so that if you know you have to go from the Dutch colony to the British colony to escort a rich trader, you might as well buy and haul some cargo of your own that you know you can sell at a profit. Goods like Cinnamon, Silk, Linen, Sandal, Chocolate and many others can be bought and sold at each town's store. If you want to walk on the wild side you might even take up selling contraband like Ale or Tobacco. Trading is influenced by your Commerce skill and your Luck skill if your dealing contraband. Having a well placed save game before you try to deal in some illegal goods, or before you try to do anything difficult for that matter, is a good way to proceed through PotC. It's just very satisfying knowing there's a solid commerce engine behind everything else going on in the game, because money is so very important.  Anytime you take to the sea, Pirates of the Caribbean really shines. The game takes on a whole different look with outstanding water and environmental effects and beautiful ship designs. You have total control over the free camera that allow you to zoom as close as you'd like and rotate the camera into any position. This allows you to literally get your bearings on friendly and enemy ships when you go into sea mode. Most often you'll be going into and out of sea mode from map mode, a wide stylized perspective that allows you to see several square miles of the archipelago and move a toy-looking version of your ship around the map. You're automatically pushed into sea mode whenever you encounter a storm, an enemy ship that wants to battle or when you push the A button to force sea mode.  You can see your crew members hustling about climbing ladders and loading cannons and even see sails raising and lowering as you manipulate the left analog stick to speed up or slow down your ship.   The sailing mechanic of the game feels very authentic as you'll have to pay attention to wind direction and speed as you attempt to maneuver around. Leaning on the left stick as hard as you can to make a fast turn doesn't help much since your ship's speed and turning radius are determined by its class and wind conditions. This is especially important to remember during combat. Any time you're in sea mode, you have the ocean-going equivalent of quick travel where you can instantly sail up to any nearby ship or land destination within a certain range. Controlling the ship in sea mode is mainly intended for fine tuning during combat.   During ship-to-ship fights you can control the action from the third person perspective and allow your cannons to automatically target enemies within range and fire on your command. This can offer some spectacular battle scenes, but you won't be nearly as effective if you don't switch to the on-the-deck first person mode where you act as the spotter for your gunners. In first person mode you can walk around on the deck of your own ship (the crew is suddenly invisible) and simply use your spyglass to locate enemy ships within range. A targeting reticule turns from green to yellow to red to indicate the likelihood of a hit but you ultimately decide when and where to shoot. If you're using knippels to tear up the sails you'll want to ignore the red indicator and aim for the enemy's masts and rigging. First person mode makes your ship a lot more accurate and deadly and enhances the overall feeling of piracy in the game.   We put in several dozen hours of gameplay into PotC and accomplished more than we thought we would once we got past the slow-moving early stages, but there's a lot to do in this game. The mission system can be a bit unintuitive with hard to understand objectives and the fact that you can have multiple missions ongoing in addition to optional tasks like selling contraband all piled on top of each other. Completing a mission or side quest may yield a heaping pile of cash, a particularly powerful weapon or some other treasure, but the more complicated ones --like the first one from the British Governor-- can be extremely tedious with all kinds of walking around and hand-to-hand fights. Plus the initial difficulty of the ship-to-ship combat makes traveling from island to island particularly perilous when you're just trying to find your way around the archipelago. Either drawing or memorizing the map of the islands will be required at some point in PotC. However, if you view the early stages of the game as one big tutorial where you really are just learning the ropes, the game really picks up in terms of depth and story. I'd recommend waiting until you get your third ship before passing judgment on Pirates because having a commanding presence on the seas makes a huge difference.  Graphics  There's an interesting mix of good and bad when it comes to the look of PotC. The game is choppy from top to bottom whether you're on land or sea. On land, the choppiness is met with decent looking character models but stiff animation that gets repetitive within hours. On the highs seas you're getting framerate issues still, but there's outstanding water and beautiful sailing vessels to look at and it's all very satisfying. When you're caught in a storm you just might get seasick if your TV is big enough.   We've already detailed the collision problems and camera issues that can make hand-to-hand combat suffer, but it extends even to scripted automated events. When the innkeeper tells you a potential client is just then entering the bar to meet you, the client walks straight towards you banging into your party members and bar patrons alike until he reaches his designate area. Whether he's talking into the back of the barmaid's head or not, he'll begin speaking as if everything was fine. I wouldn't have taken much for the automatic script to move everybody out of the way as the client walks his path towards your character.   There are no animations on the characters besides big dramatic sword slashes and other combat moves. Blank stares, cautious robotic steps and pivoting moves without moving feet or shifting weight are things best left to the previous generation of videogame consoles. It' a shame too because the environments like the ships and towns are well done with very good texture work.   Sound  There's not nearly enough pirate talk in Pirates of the Caribbean. We could forgive the lack of ~Yo Ho Hos~ and ~Shiver me timbers~ if there weren't so many lame generic lines coming from various characters. The innkeepers all use the same lines just like all of the shipyard owners use the same lines of audio even though the text of what they're saying will be appropriate. Granted there's a ton of characters who would need lines of speech but this doesn't change the fact that you get sick of hearing the same guys mumbling about ~How about a nip of the ol' tom tom?~ Whatever the hell that means.   The music is appropriate for the Age of Exploration with pan flutes, fiddles and all kinds of cymbals going on when you're on land. When you take to the seas the music is very very satisfying adventurous stuff that makes you want to put your face to the wind and taste the salt of the sea and stuff like that.   Sound effects like gunshots, cannon fire and sword clashes are all appropriate but not outstanding.  The combat on the high seas and the essence of the fact that this is a pirate RPG really help redeem Pirates of the Caribbean and all of its problems. Any other game with this many technical issues would be buried and forgotten about. But for role playing Xbox owners, there's a little bit of treasure here worth finding. Setting sail with your own fleet of ships armed to the teeth and loaded with contraband while looking to board and loot Her Majesty's finest is satisfying here. Slowly walking around town to talk to hundreds of people who rarely have new info to offer is not so satisfying. If you're looking at this as fan of the movie or of Johnnie Depp, then go ahead and skip PotC. If you've been jonesing for a traditional RPG since Morrowind came out, adjust your expectations for this pirate game and give it a shot.", "date": "Jul 3, 2003"}
