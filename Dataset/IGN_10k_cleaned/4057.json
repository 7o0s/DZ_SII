We found ourselves hooked on building our little empires, and hooked on the simulation game genre as well.  Since then sim games have grown in scope and subject matter.  Now you can find games that let you control everything from an ant farm to a colony in deep space.  Out of that realm comes a new title from Activision, Sea World Tycoon, a game which allows the player to create and maintain their ideal Sea World Adventure Park.  From the number and location of the restrooms, to just where Shamu will be performing, you can control everything in your park.   Almost every tool you could ever need is at your disposal.  You can hire and fire staff, build and destroy rides, attractions, amusements, and animal exhibits, and you can landscape in various ways.  And you can use the mouse or the keyboard to zoom the camera around and view any part of your park.  Well, almost any part.  One of the more annoying aspects of the game is your inability to rotate the camera.  You can move it up and down, or side to side, but you can't spin it around to get different views of your park.  You're always looking at it from the same angle, making placement of small details behind buildings, like scenery or paths, very difficult to get right.  At times I found my hand would slip while running a new path that went behind a building, and I'd have no way of knowing if it was complete or if there might be a break in the path I couldn't see.  And running into a break in the path can make your visitors a little upset.   Not everything about the camera control is bad though.  They did remember to include a zooming feature.  You can zoom right in close and place small details like flowers or a lawn gnome, or you can zoom all the way out and view how your park is taking shape.  In doing this they also remembered to add in little details to make things more realistic.  You can zoom in and watch people as they line up to ride a roller coaster, check out the flamingos in the flamingo exhibit, or check out Shamu swimming around for an audience.  While this feature isn't exactly necessary for gameplay, it does add a bit of realism and amusement to the game.     In the style of other sim games, Sea World Tycoon gives you many things you have to deal with in order to make a successful park.  One of the first things you have to deal with is determining what your customers want.  Because remember, the customer is always right.  There are two main tools in the game to help you keep on top of this.  The first and most obvious are little pictures that appear above the heads of people as they walk around in the park.  These pictures help show you their mood and what they want.  A smiley face means they are happy, a frown they are upset, food they are hungry, etc.  For instance, if a large number of people are looking for food in a part of your park where you have no restaurants or food carts, you might want to consider building some there.  The other tool is your message bar at the bottom of the screen.  If a message appears that people are disappointed in the number of rides, build more rides.  If they think the park is messy, hire more cleaning staff and place more trash cans.   Another big thing you have to keep tabs on is your staff.  There are four types of staff you can hire: Cleaners, Mechanics, Animal Experts, and Vets.  Each one of them is needed, some in larger number then others, in order to keep your park running smoothly.  The animal experts and vets keep your animals happy and well, the cleaning crew picks up all that pesky litter, and the mechanics make sure everything keeps running.  And believe me, you'll need all of them, especially the mechanics.  Everything from the snack cart to a roller coaster can break down, and break down they do, often.     Eventually if something starts breaking down a great deal you're forced to start destroying existing structures and building new ones.  This becomes obvious around the time you found you're no longer able to hire more mechanics and half your park seems to be broken.  This usually seems to happen about day four of game time.  Personally I think this is a tad too much.  It's one thing to have a little realism in a game, it's another to make the players spend more time worrying about what's going to break down next instead of what new ride they can build.   One of the most common complaints you'll see from the visitors to your park is that the lines are too long.  Unfortunately, since the game seems to lack a manual of any kind, this is one of the problems that are hard to figure out the answer to.  You have the ability to decide how many people have to be on a ride or at an attraction before things start, which seems to help with lines since more people can get in at a time, and adding more rides seems to help a little as well.  However this is a double-edged sword, as more rides means the park is more popular and you get more people visiting.  I have yet to figure out any foolproof way of really reducing lines for good, but thankfully if the park is popular enough long lines don't seem to hurt you much.   Sometimes though people will complain about things that don't seem to make sense.  And again, without any game manual, it's hard to figure these things out for sure.  For example, I had a park all built up.  Filled all the space that was available for building, and everything seemed fine.  Except that people were complaining that there were no animals on exhibit.  Now this had me confused since I had at least one of every animal exhibit available built in my park, two of most of them.  Yet people still complained that there were no animals on exhibit.  Apparently it's just as impossible to please everyone in the game as it is in real life.  The only real solution in this type of circumstance is to demolish some other amusement or rides and build more animal attractions.  This of course then generates a demand for what was destroyed.  It seems to be a never-ending cycle, and the player has to figure out their own way of finding a happy medium.     For all you parents out there, if your kids are interested in animals, this game can actually be an educational tool.  Included in Sea World Tycoon is what they call an Animal Browser, which lets you look up all kinds of different animals and learn all about them.  This comes in handy in the game to help figure out why your animals aren't doing well, but it can become just as fun learning about the animals then playing the game.  Overall, if you like building sims, you should enjoy this game.  All the classic elements are there, combined with an interesting theme, to give us a game that can bring many hours of fun.  Though it does have many flaws, the lack of a manual being among them, it's still a game worth buying.  As a side note to Activision, perhaps something to consider for a future expansion pack, I talked to some of my friends about the game.  Though placing the animal exhibits and watching them run can be fun, all of the females I talked to agreed that getting to train the animals, like the dolphins, would add a great amount of fun to the game.  Just something to think about if you want to bring in more female gamers.", "date": "Oct 23, 2003"}
