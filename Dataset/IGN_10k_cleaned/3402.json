The Mac port of the game is spectacular and includes the multiplayer update so we have easily spent more time playing this game than the combined lives of 10 generations of may flies. The best news is that Heroes of Might and Magic IV is every bit as impressive as any of the previous titles in the series.   But rather than just offering some small evolutionary changes to the admittedly addictive existing games, Heroes IV ponies up some significant changes that, in my opinion, only make the game more enjoyable.   For those of you who have just joined us, Heroes of Might and Magic is a turn-based strategy series that's enjoyed tremendous success -- and deservedly so. Players lead their armies and heroes around a fantastic world, capturing towns and fighting fantastic creatures and evil overlords. Heck, in Heroes you can even be one of the evil overlords.   Heroes IV continues the tradition in fine style and fans of the series shouldn't even bother reading the rest of the review. Steal a car and go buy a copy of the game right now. There are some small problems here and there but, overall, this is a fantastic addition to the franchise. Six new campaigns and a whole batch of scenarios will likely keep you occupied until the next installment or expansion comes along.   The game has always been about the heroes but heroes are an even bigger focus now. Their role has been changed a bit as well. Most significantly, your heroes now take a more active role in the battles. They'll take the field alongside your other creatures and will have to attack and defend just like the rank and file. This makes the cultivation and preservation of heroes an even greater priority. Luckily, it's as rewarding as it is important.   Hero development has been enlarged quite a bit. Each hero begins in one of eleven different classes based on their starting skill. Heroes trained in Nobility are your Lords while those trained in Life magic are Priests. Combat-oriented characters are divided between Barbarians (for melee oriented folks) and Archers (for the ranged types). As your hero gains levels, he or she will also gain new skills. Once you depart from your main skill branch and start specializing in a second set of skills, your hero can become one of 36 different sub-classes.   A Knight who supplements his Tactics skill with a little Death magic becomes a Reaver. A Thief who opts to focus on Nature Magic in addition to his regular scouting skill set becomes a Bard. Each of the 48 total character classes come with their own unique bonuses and benefits as well. Cardinals (specializing in Life magic and Nobility) gain a 5% bonus to resurrection. Heroes who combine Chaos and Death magic become Liches and can age their opponents thereby reducing their offensive and defensive abilities.   In all there are nine skill groupings -- individual combat, tactics, scouting, nobility and five different colleges of magic -- life, death, order, nature and chaos. Every primary skill group has three separate secondary skills associated with it. All skills provide unique bonuses (resurrection lets you reclaim a portion of the units lost in battle, for instance). Since each primary and secondary skill has five rankings there's a lot of variety to be explored here.   In fact building up your heroes and seeing them get better and more powerful is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. Unfortunately it also ties in with a weakness in the campaigns. You're not allowed to take all of your heroes through from one mission to the next. Those that are crucial to the advancement of the story are automatically passed through of course but then the game selects a varying number of additional heroes to pass on to the next scenario. The problem is that the game selects the highest-level heroes itself instead of allowing you to pick which ones you'd like to carry over.   This presents two problems. For one thing, most scenarios grant you new, high level heroes as part of the story. It can be a real let down to build up a high level priest only to discover that another high level priest will be granted to you in the next mission. Great, now you just gave up the 23rd level Beastmaster you really enjoyed so you can have two 25th level Priests. It wouldn't be too much of a problem if the heroes you get later in the adventure had any chance in hell of actually getting up to a high enough level to oust your earlier (and now unfortunately redundant) heroes. Unless you're willing to focus exclusively on leveling a particular hero by exploring every experience opportunity on a given level, you might as well not get too attached to your lower level heroes.   The various campaigns and scenarios are tied together with well-developed stories that have strong characters and meaningful episodes. As you wander about the world of Heroes you'll notice a few other changes. For one thing, there's now a fog of war that works alongside the normal shroud that obscures the map. It might actually become a priority to station guards and garrisons at key passes so you can keep an eye on the movement of your enemies. It might be, but the truth is that the enemy and neutral armies are still relatively passive throughout the game and you'll rarely find yourself scrambling to keep up with or in front of their efforts.    Like your heroes, you'll have to specialize with your towns as well. Instead of letting you build the maximum amount of creature producing structures in any one town, Heroes IV restricts you to one particular creature producing building for each creature level. If you build Dragon Factories to make dragons you can't build a Cloud Castle to make Titans. If you build A Unicorn Glade you get unicorns but you won't be able to build Griffin Cliffs to get griffins, at least not in that same town.   The armies themselves can now exist and move around the map without hero leaders. You can also split your armies in the field now which opens up a bunch of new strategies. Creature armies can serve as effective scouts or garrisons and can even carry dead heroes back to be resurrected. I've also found them useful for going around and gathering reinforcements while my main armies are busy elsewhere. (The Caravan structure allows you to transfer creatures from town to town much more quickly than they can move overland.)   The battles have changed a bit as well. For one thing, it's much prettier. Battles are waged on varied terrain types (including ship battles and town sieges) in an isometric rather than side-on perspective. It makes things much easier to see. The tactical AI is pretty sharp and more than capable of presenting a considerable challenge, at least when the numbers of the forces involved are fairly even. A new system of counterattacks means that your forces (and your enemies) are still sort of in danger during their own attack phase. A quick combat option has been added to speed things along when you just can't be bothered to direct the action yourself.   The graphics are a mixed bag. They certainly don't detract from my enjoyment of the game but they don't compare with the graphics in Warcraft 3. Unit sprites and animations are a bit stiff and awkward and there's simply not enough variation among the hero models. Warrior heroes wear generic armor and spellcasters appear in purple robes. The overland map is pleasant to look at but is a little too busy to really appreciate.   But if the graphics are only passable, the sound is quite nice. The music is suitably exotic and sets the mood without being overpowering. The few voiceovers are done well. The real winner here are the small sounds that pepper the game at odd moments. You'll hear the clank of armor as your Crusaders move about the field and you'll hear the pinions snapping in the wind.   When the PC version shipped, it was sans multiplayer. No such delay for us Mac gamers. Right out of the box you can start whoopin' chainmailed butt with up to 6 players over the Internet or a LAN. I have to admit that this is perhaps the most addicting side of the game, as human players are much more... unpredictable... than the computer A.I.   As gameplay goes, Heroes of Might and Magic IV is a huge winner, but I hope if you're a fan you've got a speedy machine. On our test unit, a G4 733 with a Radeon 8500, the game ran well, but a little slow. A friend with a dual 1 Gig machine had a much better experience than I did. The game also has a few random bugs, but 3DO recently released a patch that addresses most of them.   Bottomline, another outstanding chapter in the franchise. Go buy it.If you haven't figured it out already, I love this game. There's been a real resurgence in both turn-based and fantasy themed RTS games over the past year or so. Games like Disciples and Age of Wonders have really helped breathe new life into the genre. And while it's important to acknowledge the success of those ~new~ titles, it's equally gratifying to see one of the genre's touchstone series take such an interesting turn. Heroes IV is original enough to seem really fresh while still clinging faithfully to the ideas that made the previous games so completely awesome.Ultimately, as I've always said, the real test of a game's worth is whether or not we'll still be playing it after the review is done. It might sound slightly ungrateful, but when you play a hundred games a year, only the really good ones make the transition from work to play. Heroes IV is definitely a title I'll keep playing in the coming months. The great balance and fabulous background of the game are simply outstanding. Variable hero specialization and army composition even give the campaigns a high replay value. If you're a fan of turn-based or fantasy themed strategy games, you owe it to yourself to check out Heroes of Might and Magic IV whether you've been following the series or not.", "date": "Jan 29, 2003"}
