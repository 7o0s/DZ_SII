It's a game that falls into a grey area, a place where it can be looked upon and respected for what it accomplished in its initial release, but also a place where it's not yet nostalgic enough to appreciate over its far-superior sequel. It's possible that you're the kind of hardcore fan for whom this N64 title was the pinnacle of the F-Zero series. And, if so, download away. But those players not already familiar with Nintendo's high-octane hovercraft racing franchise would be better served to ignore this middle-of-the-road installment and jump straight into the much more impressive experience of its GameCube follow-up, F-Zero GX.This is one ugly game. That's no modern opinion, though, as even in 1998 this racer was called visually bland  but it was a blandness adopted on purpose. Nintendo's EAD team held back the graphics power of the 64-bit system in order to push forward more cars on-screen at once, and a faster framerate to handle it all. Individually, then, each racing machine isn't much to look at  the point is that there's 30 of them, all distinctly modeled, all driving together, and all silky smooth on the tracks.    The 480p upgrade offered through the Virtual Console's emulator helps to give more clarity to the F-Zero hovercars, as it did for the angular ship designs in Star Fox 64. Unfortunately, though, the presentation takes a difficult hit from the new, ~enhanced~ appearance of the 2D graphical elements  the menu screens, racers' portraits and text displays all look terrible now without the muddying mask of running on an actual Nintendo 64. Like the sprite-based racers in Mario Kart 64 and the cut-out trees in front of Peach's Castle in Super Mario 64, anything that was originally a two-dimensional object in an N64 title ends up looking horrible when redisplayed at a higher resolution.Unravaged by the passage of time is X's superb control and feel, and overall gameplay by extension  this is the game that truly established what F-Zero is, and it's natural to climb back into the cockpit here even after nearly a decade. The inclusion of 30 different vehicles was a visual achievement, true, but is more impressive on the selection screen  though only six different cars are available at first, every player will be able to find the one that feels just right, with the proper balance of grip, hull integrity and boosting power.The last of those three aspects was one of the key innovations for F-Zero X. The original F-Zero allowed you to boost to get ahead of the competition, but you had to earn each activation of your turbo rockets one at a time by completing individual laps. In F-Zero X you can instead boost as much as you want after the first lap is finished, provided you have enough energy remaining  each burst of speed drains away some of your craft's hit points, so successfully finding the finish line first becomes a strategic battle between purposefully emptying your reserves to gain more velocity and making sure you've got enough energy left that you won't explode before reaching the next recharging pit strip.Another addition made in X was attack maneuvers, allowing you to slam your ship sideways into the opposition or execute a 360 degree spin to deflect too-close competitors. F-Zero isn't Wipeout or Mario Kart, so there's no weaponry, oil slicks or banana peels, but the addition of these two body-bashing moves let players feel more dangerous while still maintaining the high-speed, pure racing focus. It's still satisfying to fire up F-Zero X's Death Race mode and systematically destroy each of your 29 adversaries, one at a time.And it's still satisfying to just play through the standard Grand Prix racing modes, progressing from track to track through the Jack, Queen and King Cups, seeing the loops, tunnels and grand jumps in 3D  but really, there's just something missing now. It's easy to see how F-Zero X was impressive in its day, and it can still be fun to pick up and ride through what this game offers again, but all the while it's just impossible to ignore that it's all since been done again, and done so much better. All of the innovations and impressive aspects of F-Zero X are improved upon in the more recent release of F-Zero GX on the GameCube, a game that also got the sound, story presentation and, above all, the visuals exactly right. F-Zero X is a 10 dollar download, and you're having to deal with a wealth of annoying legacy issues along with it  GX is just a few dollars more, and it's essentially a full-on Wii experience that runs in 480p and 16:9 widescreen, and is just much more fun all around.So its a tricky spot that F-Zero X marks. It could be recommended as a great-feeling, tightly-controlled, fast-playing racing experience  which it is. But it cant be ignored that its sequel GX is the superior experience, and, as its fully playable on the backwards-compatible Wii, wed recommend finding a copy of it instead for first-time F-Zero initiates. Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time stand alone as timeless classics, adventures that should be experienced even though sequels like Sunshine and Twilight Princess have come along since. Star Fox 64 is still the high point of its franchise, as its follow-ups have failed to live up the standard it set in 1997. But F-Zero X isnt in the same group as those other N64 VC releases. Its sequel did live up to its standard, and exceeded it  and in doing so rendered this release not quite obsolete, but at least much less desirable as an individual game. Dont stray into the grey area of X, unless youre an established fan from eight and a half years ago.", "date": "Jun 30, 2007"}
