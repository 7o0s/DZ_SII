Almost as if it was marking the anniversary, Nintendo has brought back that design in a new package for the Game Boy Advance in Mario vs. Donkey Kong. Unless you've already been familiarized by the original Game Boy title, though, you'd never realize it was a revisit; it really feels like Nintendo and developer NST made a conscious effort to give the Mario vs. Donkey Kong the image of an original franchise. But we know better. Even though the game isn't unique, the entire experience is because every one of the challenges are new to the GBA production. And though we miss the old-school presentation, it's still great to play the fantastic game design in a fresh perspective. Features 48 levels Hidden extra modes Cartridge save (three slots)  Donkey Kong has given up his thirty-year Pauline-kidnapping fixation. Now, he's looking to collect one of the hottest toys around: Mini Marios. He's cutting out the middle man, though, and heading straight to the source: the factory that's making the darn things. And, he's collecting them all, too, leaving none for all the good little boys and girls to enjoy for themselves. Enter Mario, the big ape's arch nemesis since those hazy Jumpman days, braving the various mechanisms of the toy factory to scoop up all the toys Donkey Kong accidentally scattered in his ascent through the structure.  If it all seems familiar, that's because Nintendo's NST group developed Mario and Donkey Kong around the established formula of Donkey Kong, or rather Donkey Kong 1994, taking all of the platform and puzzle elements, as well as all of Mario's abilities created for that game, and building new challenges for the Game Boy Advance version. Even if you've blown through Donkey Kong 1994, all of the challenges are unique to Mario vs. Donkey Kong, so in essence it's a brand new experience in a familiar package.  The game design takes solid, tried-and-true Mario-style platforming elements and constructs levels that challenge the player's ability to maneuver Mario from location to location in order to collect the lost packages scattered in strategic locations. Each level is segmented into at least two parts: one where players must snag a package and carry a key from its original location to a locked door that leads to the level's Part Two: two more packages and a lost Mini Mario. To successfully move on, all that's required is the key in Part One, and the Mini Mario in part two, but to score the Big Points, and ultimately unlock the bonus Hard Mode, everything must be scored in the shortest amount of time.  The level layouts are constructed to take advantage of Mario's special techniques, many of which make reference to Mario's extensive 25-plus year videogame career. Standard Donkey Kong platform gaps and ladders put Mario's usual run, jump, and climbing abilities to task. Hovering platforms require Mario's double and super-high jump. Most enemies are harmless on their backs, and can be picked up and tossed a la Super Mario 2's ~pluck~ element. The Hammer returns for this design, giving Mario the classic Donkey Kong ability to smash everything in his path...enhancing that element with the slick ability to toss it away during use and catch it in mid-air elsewhere in the level. After six levels of an area comes the game's original design: the task of taking the Mini Marios through the factory hazards and get them back into their toychest. It's a challenge that crosses Lemmings with Donkey Kong and ultimately gives the game its unique flavor from its Game Boy counterpart. There honestly should be more of these challenges than simply filling up a mere 1/8th of Mario vs. Donkey Kong's gameplay experience.  Each world also has its boss battle with Donkey Kong himself, and it's here where Mario vs. Donkey Kong gets its namesake. But in all honesty these levels are the ones with the least amount of creativity, and varies dramatically in difficulty from world to world. Actually, the challenge isn't about defeating Donkey Kong, since the technique to defeat him isn't all that secretive. No, the challenge is to see if you can defeat him unscathed, since the game awards points to the player based on how many hits he took during the battle.  Much of the charm of the original Donkey Kong was in experiencing how Nintendo's game designers took the original arcade concept and built upon it for a contemporary game design, all without straying from the look or feel of the classic game. The original Game Boy was a perfect platform for this idea since its graphic and audio capabilities, apart from being black and white (or simplistic color on the Super Game Boy), wasn't far removed from the hardware that the classic arcade game was produced on. But for Mario vs. Donkey Kong, NST abandoned this simplicity for a wildly contemporary art-style, producing awkward but admittedly well-animated 3D rendered Mario and enemy sprites that just doesn't fit the game. It just feels out of place to see all these rendered graphics since the game plays ~guess the Mario reference~ throughout the adventure, and many of the games the designers reference didn't use such elaborate graphics.  Nintendo and NST also go just one notch further in over-the-top presentation by making Mario and Donkey Kong overly chatty. Whether it's the direction Nintendo's taking with its key characters or simply the development team showing off its audio compression techniques, it's an element that just doesn't need to be there. It's not overly distracting to hear all this chatter, but it would just fit the characters more if Nintendo just kept the dialogue simple.  But awkward, misplaced presentation aside, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is still a top-notch Game Boy Advance game because the levels are filled with highly challenging designs, skillfully balancing platform action with mind-bending puzzle elements. And though it seems like it's over too soon, NST's stuck in a lot of elements to keep the action going well beyond its end, including a harder mode for players who break the high score record on each of the 48 original challenges. All of the well-established gameplay elements of the original have returned in new and fun platformer challenges with a decidedly different theme and flavor, taking advantage of the more powerful GBA platform. Strangely, Nintendo has seemingly ignored the game's roots instead of simply embracing them, playing off this game as a separate and ~new~ franchise instead of positioning it as what it really is: a continuation of one of the best, most recommended Game Boy titles in the system's library. Because the new design takes such a drastically different approach in its art style and presentation it feels just a little awkward to those who enjoyed the original Game Boy Donkey Kong and its faithful retroness. Beyond that element, though, there's a lot to enjoy in Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and its new production is still a can't-miss action title for the Game Boy Advance.", "date": "May 24, 2004"}
