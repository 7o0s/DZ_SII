Due to its bad timing, unfamiliar branding, limited distribution, and mostly poor critical reception (we gave it a very favorable 7.8 score, thank you very much), Super Army Wars hit the retail scene with the power of a diffused bomb.   This clearly didn't discourage the original developer, who went on to improve the Game Boy Advance design for the Nintendo DS. Now that Atlus is out and Secret Stash is in as the game's publisher, the original moniker returns: Glory Days 2 is a return to the established arcade-slash-tactical action game, but with much more ~oomph~ added to the design. Though its inspiration pulls from classic computer games from the 80s, Glory Days 2 is like nothing you've played on the DS. Its intimidating design and somewhat steep learning curve might be a turn off for some, but stick with it for a few missions and you'll find some really impressive and fun gameplay inside.   Trying to describe Glory Days is a challenge in itself. On the one hand, it's a side-scrolling shooter much like Choplifter or Defender, where you'll pilot a single craft from one side of a very long 2D map to the other trying to take out an advancing army of tanks, jeeps, and soldiers marching towards your base. But it's also a game of tactics, as you're trying to build an army of your own that'll work in the other direction towards the opposing army's base. To earn money for this army, you need to secure bunkers along the way by airdropping paratroopers to take them overor, if you're in a helicopter, landing and scooping up innocent civilians and carting them back to your base. The ultimate task? Taking out your enemy's base with your steadily marching army of tanks.   The game's more action focused than strategic, at least in the beginning. The designers push more of an arcade feel early on, making the whole ~army building~ thing an automatic process and leaving the whole flying-and-shooting thing at the players' hands. Helicopters first, then winged aircraft that are faster but don't maneuver as tightly. The game can be controlled either the traditional D-pad/button way, but with all the analog enhancements given to touch-screen stylus control, it's hard to play it the traditional way.     Plus, once you do earn the ability to build up an army, you'll find that using the stylus is really the only way to play Glory Days 2. It's admittedly a little clunky at first, since you're using the touch pen to maneuver the aircraft on the upper screen, as well as using it to bring up a side menu to tap which units to buyat the same time. It'll get better once you get a little practice switching back and forth between the combo craft control and menu selection, but it never really gets what you'd consider ~seamless.~     Now, most of the army building portion is simply buying a messload of tanks and have them push forward as far as they can. But there are other things you can do: pepper in Jeeps, for example, so that they can fire off surface-to-air missiles at enemy craft trying to swoop in for a few tank kills. There's also a refueling truck that gives players the ability to restock weapons simply by flying in close to the vehicle; the downside is that if it gets taken out, it explodes big time, taking out any troops, allies or enemies, that are within the blast radius. Clearly you need to space that sucker out.   Aside from the army building aspect, the strategy's also built into the action. There are lots of little things you can do to keep their army back - bombing from high above or swoop-strafing in a steep diveall the way down to sacrificing one of your aircraft by flying in at highspeed and kamikaze landing on top of a long streak of enemy tanks. You can even use enemy firepower to your advantage: taunt an enemy jeep to fire a heatseeking missile and force it to follow you until it runs out of fueland watch it plummet right on top of an enemy tank or two. Boom. Very satisfying.   It's very hard to prove that it's the case, but it feels like the computer AI opponents in later levels have the upperhand with much stronger tanks simply to make the single player campaign a much more difficult experience. I can't count how many times an army of a dozen or more of my tanks were taken out by a single stubborn one on the opposing side. Naturally the idea is for you to help your tanks along by taking out the others, but it just feels a little unfair and one sided when a single solitary tank can withstand so much firepower from such a huge army on the other side. So trying to plow through the 16 campaigns starts to get a little frustrating halfway through since you'll need to play through them a few times to figure out the strengths of the computer side.   Luckily the game features a ~skirmish~ option where you can pretty much create your own missions with as much or as little army creation as possible. If you want a game that's pure action, go for it. Want one where you'll need to spend tons of money on dozens of tanks? That's up to you too. You can even have more than a few handful of computer AI controlled teammates zooming around to assist, or the same number of enemy craft to give players something to avoid and shoot at, as well as choose whether you're piloting a helicopter or plane.   This customization also applies to Glory Days 2's extremely strong multiplayer component. It was potential that went omitted in the Game Boy Advance original, but on the Nintendo DS it supports up to eight players in the wireless link. Everything that you can do in the skirmish mode is in the multiplayer, and it works extraordinarily well. The downside is the fact that you need multiple copies for the multiplayer...and the sequel's missed opportunity is the lack of online play. But it's definitely good enough to convince local buddies to spend the 30 bucks on their own copy of the game -- multiplayer Glory Days can really get intense.      Visually the game's a nice 2D experience with decent sprite effects, and a tight engine that allows for tons of on-screen items with no slowdown. The game offers a dynamic camera on the touch screen to supplement the player's view on the top, which keeps tabs on the portion of the battlefield with the most going on. But it's the audio that really steals the show: play this game out loud and you'll get outside observers wondering where that stunningly awesome, dynamic soundtrack's coming from. Surely it's not coming from that DS in your hands. But it is. And it sounds absolutely fantastic.When the original Game Boy Advance game ~Super Army Wars~ hit the scene a couple of years ago, I was amazed to see how few game critics ~got it.~ The game had its issues, but it took classics like Choplifter, Wings of Fury, and Rescue Raiders and mashed them up into a contemporary piece that worked pretty darn well on the GBA. The DS sequel gives the concept a second chance: the developers improve on the concept with enhanced gameplay features and more strategic elements, and push a full-on multiplayer mode. I can't help but feel a little disappointed for the lack of single cartridge and online multiplayer, but as is Glory Days 2 is polished pretty well. It's a unique game in the DS line-up that deserves checking out.", "date": "Aug 1, 2007"}
