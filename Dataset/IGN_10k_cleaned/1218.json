Because the name now holds power in the gaming community, it's not surprising that Nintendo wants to ride the wave with the Game Boy Color, so it's back to Rare, the N64 game's development team, for a portable rendition in the series. Features Transfer Pak support Seven single-player missions  25 multiplayer maps 12 mini-games Infra-red port for data transfer Rumble cartridge Support for the Game Boy Printer Battery save (three positions) Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  There's no way you can honestly expect an accurate depiction of the same game design that hit the Nintendo 64, so take that idea right out of your head. The Rare Game Boy Color team took the storyline, characters, and ideas of the original console title and built a prequel of sorts. But even though the game is a one-of-a-kind in the Perfect Dark series, there's not an original bone in its body. It's filled to the rim with features and mini-games, but everything in the game has been done before in other titles of gaming past.  The team obviously built the Game Boy Color game around an already-awesome game released earlier this year, Metal Gear Solid. Perfect Dark borrows heavily from Konami's design, offering a similar overhead perspective and stealth gameplay used in Solid Snake's Game Boy Color adventure for Perfect Dark's main game, slightly modifying the design so as not to blatantly steal the whole idea. Joanna is your character, and you must guide her in the jungle, city streets, and building catwalks to nail the bad guys with four types of weaponry. Most missions are of the same design, where you'll plant bombs and/or rescue hostages  but it's all about shooting the guards and taking their equipment (like guns, ammo, and health) so you can advance further into enemy territory.   Stealth comes into play, similar to Metal Gear Solid, but it's not employed nearly as well in Perfect Dark. Joanna's walk doesn't make a noise, which makes it a snap to sneak up to an enemy guard and put a bullet through his skull  but make a noise, like reload your weapon or lean into a run, and the guards will turn in your direction. There's no way to bring a guard in your direction other than letting him see you  this is where Rare should have stolen the ~knock on a surface~ feature. Here's the main problem with the stealth AI  stand on the other side of a waist-high object, like a shrub or a couch, and the guard will lose sight of you. This is where you can take advantage of the idiot AI  simply find an object that's smaller than you are, get on the other side of it, and shoot the guard who's looking in your direction but cannot ~see~ you. There are plenty of opportunities for this type of play, which makes the game easy to exploit and a little easier to finish. The game's a challenge, sure  but these lame gameplay holes are inexcusable.  The controls in the main game are little on the loose side  Joanna  moves with incredible fluidity, but that's right there's a problem since it feels like Joanna could and should be moving at a faster pace  it's one of those games that hurt the thumb simply from the reflex of pushing the controller harder hoping that would affect the character's speed. And trying to stop in place aiming in a diagonal direction is nearly impossible  there are plenty of places in the game where you'd want to sneak into a doorway and target an enemy that's not directly in front or to the side of you  but when you let go of the D-pad heading in a diagonal direction, 99% of the time Joanna will snap to an up, down, left or right position. Very annoying. And though Joanna and the enemy guards are large, fluidly-animated sprites, I'd take smaller characters over these any day, simply because you can't see more than ten feet in front of your character. The designers even take up valuable screen real estate with a stupid healthbar that takes up more than a tenth of the vertical right side of the screen. This health bar could have been done with less pixels, and in its place could have been a more useful overhead map. But nope  the designers thought it'd be cool to represent Joanna's health by an EKG meter.  The training mode is a real drag  I spent literally a couple hours finishing just the training simply because some of the missions are ridiculously sensitive in their quotas. Make one mistake and it's right back to the beginning. But once through these early missions, the game opens up and then the main fun begins.    The main game is decent, but in relatively small doses  I'm guessing Rare saw this as well and packed as many as twelve mini-games into the game, interspersing them between the missions to give Perfect Dark a lot of variety. And they work, too  they don't have enough merit to stand alone as separate titles, but at least they give your fingers a break from the usual ~hunt down the guards and shoot them~ Perfect Dark GBC fare. I haven't found one mini game in Perfect Dark that hasn't been swiped from a classic arcade game. The boat level is simply Operation Wolf, the driving level is ripped right out of Spy Hunter,  the ~Shoot down airplane~ boss level is taken right out of Cabal and Nam 1975...and heck, you've even got Simon Says in the form of door lock-picking. If you beat any of these mini-games, you can access them in Perfect Dark's extras menu.  And that's the area that Perfect Dark excels  in extras. Along with the addition of mini-games, you can print out profiles of characters using the Game Boy Printer, but only if you find them in the game. But the most impressive feature is its use of the link cable for two players.  As you progress in the game's single player adventure, you unlock maps for the multiplayer deathmatch modes. Here, you and a friend (with another system and Perfect Dark cartridge) link together via Game Link cable and go at it. Games range from simply kill-the-other-person-in-the-designated time challenges to the Capture the flag style (hold on to the flag while unarmed as long as you can). There's even an option where one person guards two hostages, and the other person tries to rescue them. All of these games are welcome additions and are done really well (no glitching or slowdown), but let's be realistic   two players in a deathmatch game is a bit on the dull side. It would have been nice to have the option of putting AI bots in the mix, in order to make the game less a stand-off in the middle of the street. There's no real strategy involved in these deathmatch games other than to find the other person and open fire until one dies and respawns elsewhere on the map.  I definitely have to give Rare credit  the game wasn't just thrown together to make a quick buck. Just looking at all the feature in the game, from the game options and extras all the way down to the clean digitized voices and sound effects, it's obvious that an ~A~ development team was put on Perfect Dark for the Game Boy Color. But I can't ignore the little gameplay and control nuances that detract from the overall fun of playing Perfect Dark, despite having a lot of variety to the entire game design. Still, there is a lot to the game, and thanks to the battery save after every level you can take a break and play Perfect Dark in small, enjoyable doses.", "date": "Sep 6, 2000"}
