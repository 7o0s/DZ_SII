Now, with the tactical sim market one of the strongest in the industry, Ripcord Games is attempting a second shot at being the top commando of the genre, by taking on the Green Berets. Their name is synonymous with being big, bad, and stealthy. Have they managed to do the Green Berets justice with a top quality title? Well, to put it bluntly -- no.  In Spec Ops II you assume the role of a squad commander in charge of a group of commandos.  In theory, this sounds like a game that would be a lot of fun.  I'm a huge fan of the tactical first-person sim genre, and creeping around in the desert, jungle, and snow with the Green Berets is a great concept. The sad part here is that Spec Ops II doesn't cut it, it's just not any fun. A lot of the missions, particularly in the Thai and Korean theaters, are simply too realistic, and yes, that is possible. Finishing a mission, even on the easiest of the three difficulties, can be extraordinarily hard, and no one wants a game they can't play. While the difficulty can be blamed on a lot of factors (like being able to control the game, or not being able to control the game as the case may be) some of the problem lie in finding the enemies themselves. Trying to find an enemy soldier at night, especially in the jungle, even with the aide of night-vision goggles, is a very tedious and challenging process. The infrared scope of a sniper rifle is the only easier way to find enemies, because they're so well camouflaged. These enemies are split into five different categories of artificial intelligence -- snipers, fix sentries, path patrols, hunters, and close quarters. Though somehow they all adopt the same tactic; camping and waiting in the bushes, then cutting through your entire team when you least expect it. Believe me, it's not a lot of fun.   Unfortunately, still screenshots feature Spec Ops II's graphics better than the actual gameplay. It runs so choppy that the game can be nearly impossible to play, even on a decent machine. While the lighting looks great, the sky is nicely done, and the terrain is acceptable, the trees and foliage look like they were taken straight from a Build engine era game -- blocky and pixelated. There are six campaigns in different areas of the world. These include the JFK training levels, Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. The character models themselves are beautiful and well detailed, that is, when they stand still. The men run like Herman Munster. Although, one nice feature is that you can now lie prone or kneel, which is quite useful. All in all, the 3rd person view is well done, though very difficult to actually play from. To Spec Ops II's credit, the grenade effects are the best and most realistic I've seen. Plus, explosions can knock down trees, and that's just cool.   The men under your command, supposed Green Berets, appear to have been sent directly from a half-assed community college ROTC program. As soon as you get into a situation where they might actually be useful, they completely spaz out and do either one of two things: run AWOL into the thick jungle ahead and get cut down by a sniper before they make it 15 yards, or they all get stuck on a tree. Smart AI, guys, smart AI.  Well, I must at least give Spec Ops II: Green Berets credit for creating extremely realistic situations. I became so inconsolably frustrated with the control that I was forced to adopt a true American strategy, like one used back in Nam'. I resorted to carpet shelling the jungles with a 40MM grenade launcher (forget about civilians!) and wildly shooting into the trees with a heavy machine gun in the off chance that I'd actually hit somebody. It seems like Spec Ops II inadvertently modeled a real time war scenario -- complete with the absolute mayhem of controlling men and pointless deaths. Where's the napalm air strike when you need it?   The controls. Ahhh, where do I even begin? The controls are so mind-blowingly poor, that they alone make this game a chore to play. It's that frustrating. With a lot of the commands there is lag time from when you enter the key to when the commanded action happens. When running, it's very difficult to shoot (which goes along with the true-to-life theme that this game has established), but the target pointer disappears when you're on the move and only reappears a moment after you stop. Without a target pointer while running, along with the lag in its reappearance after stopping, results in countless, and quite pointless, deaths while playing. With the controls as unresponsive as they are, close quarters battle is totally out of the question. When moving is a huge effort, it's not a good sign.   Spec Ops II does have a wide variety of weapons, though. In all, there are eight assault rifles, four sub-machineguns, two machine guns, two sniper rifles, three grenade launchers, and one shotgun. While most of the weapons are well done, they all feel too much alike, and perform nearly the same. Most enemies can take multiple shots, whether from a sub-machinegun or a heavy machine gun, which is completely ridiculous. The only weapon that can consistently kill in one shot is the sniper rifle. There's a variety of equipment options, with everything from C4 high explosives and mines, to a variety of grenades (HE, smoke, white phosphorous, and frag) and extra ammo magazines. Any combination of these weapons and equipment can be chosen in the equipment load out screen before entering each mission.  The weapon sounds are surprisingly accurate and believable, at least for many of the weapons, and add a great deal to the enjoyment of the game.   The interface, unfortunately, is surprisingly unintuitive and unpolished. Everything from choosing options (you can't change video settings in the options menu, only before each and every mission), to mission selection and character equipment load out is poorly done. The briefing for each mission is totally inadequate, only offering a few cryptic directions about mission objectives, without offering any kind of a map or explanation. This is followed by a full motion video movie, with text subtitles, offering a little extra setting. Although, to my dismay, the subtitles became garbled each and every time as a result of a nasty bug. An example of another ugly feature; if you fail a mission and are killed, you cannot simply retry the mission. Instead, you must return to the main menu, choose the difficulty level again , choose the campaign, choose the same mission once again, and then go through the equipment and personnel load out screens again. Needless to say, this is incredibly time consuming, and becomes tedious very quickly.   Spec Ops II: Green Berets does include multiplayer capability, and this is a very welcome feature in the tactical first-person sim genre. These games are just too well suited for multiplayer to be limited to single player campaigns. Spec Ops II is a much more enjoyable game playing against human opponents, when camouflage can work for you and not merely against you all the time. The hardest part most players will find with Spec Ops II's multiplayer is finding someone to play with. In this endeavor, it would probably be best to contact one of the many clans listed in the manual to find a group of players that consistently play. The multiplayer option is not accessible through the regular menu, though, and must be entered into out of the game in a chatroom lobby style interface. There are a number of nice multiplay game styles available, including death match, team vs. team deathmatch, cooperative mission, team vs. team mission, and king of the hill. The multiplayer capability of Spec Ops II: Green Berets is in some ways a saving grace for the title, and provides most of the fun that this game has to offer.   Everything considered, Spec Ops II seems unfinished. If you ever wanted to find out what beta testing for a product is like, then this title is for you. The environments, weapons, and mission settings, for the most part, felt cheesy and unconvincing. I kept thinking that I'd run into Chuck Norris, and that this was all actually a set for a bad Vietnam war straight-to-video movie. Even hardcore Spec Ops: Rangers Lead the Way fans will have a hard time swallowing Spec Ops II: Green Berets. With the likes of Rogue Spear and Delta Force II as competition, Spec Ops II really pales in comparison. Even despite the game's high points -- decent graphics, sheer number of weapons, and multiplayer support -- it's simply not very much fun. Spec Ops II isn't a terrible game, and it has a great concept, but it could have been so much better.   -- Erik PetersonSupposedly this version of Spec Ops had been lost in development hell almost since the PC game hit, floating around and begging for release for some time now, and just didn't have a place in the world with a potential publisher. That was, until Take 2 needed a few kamikazes for its budget game line-up. This is a well-intentioned game, but Spec Ops is an armless midget on a NBA basketball court with a bear trap on both legs.", "date": "Nov 24, 1999"}
