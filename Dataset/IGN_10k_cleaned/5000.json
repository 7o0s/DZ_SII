For years, gamers had turned to EA's storied NHL franchise to live out their hockey dreams-- but in recent times, EA's wunderkind has fallen off a bit, or at least changed its focus. Starting with 2003, more emphasis has been placed on razzle-dazzle, big goals and especially big hits, to the delight of arcade aficionados, and the relative dismay of purists.    With 2005 the formula remains largely the same, although the game has been refined slightly. Franchise mode has been beefed up, the presentation has been improved and exciting new modes have been added, but the question remains: is this a hockey game that appeals to hardcore hockey fans as well as casual observers (as Madden does with football), or does NHL 2005 leave the savvy fans in the slush?   As always, the answer is not all that simple. NHL's main problem is tweaking. It ends up being very much an arcade game, with little variation in style of play. It's end-to-end action the whole way through with big shots, big hits and big saves (which is an improvement over last year). This sort of approach isn't a bad thing if you're into an arcade experience, but there is a lot of adjusting that needs to be done to make this into a more subdued, realistic game.    At times, the pacing and feel of the game seems off. This is due to mainly to the control, which is less fluid than it should be. For instance, putting different touch on a pass is a matter of holding down the buttonthe longer it is held, the faster the pass. This is counter-intuitive when trying to set up bang-bang one-timers. In addition, once in awhile, players will pass in such a way that they make their teammate cross the blue line, and force them to try to adjust to the puck. If a puck is passed wrong, shouldn't the receiver of it hold up at the line and let the puck go by, rather than intentionally go offsides just to complete it?    Click For More Images Luckily, there is a saucer pass control, which is handled in the same way as in ESPN, by using a modifier button. The saucer pass helps, but can't rectify the fact that sometimes a player will pass into the boards or to no one, even when there is another skater in the area, and you are pressing in his direction.    It's a wonder that they didn't use the same sort of set up as the pass/saucer pass modifier to change up shots. Instead, there are two buttonsone for ~Shot~ and one for ~Wrist Shot.~ Each still needs to be held down to produce a harder shot. Why not use a modifier button for a slap shot, and otherwise default to a wrister? While shooting itself feels great -- EA does a great job of capturing what it feels like to unleash a serious blast or a wrist zingerthe control could have and should have been handled differently. What makes the control situation even more difficult is that there seems to be a tiny lag in response when you press a button. The split second of lost response contributes to the disjointed, stiff feel mentioned earlier.    There is too much emphasis on jaw-rattling hits as well. Here is a prediction: if you're a fan of sim-style hockey, you're going to get pretty tired of bringing the puck into the zone only to get leveled time and time again. It's especially enervating after the fifth or sixth time you line up to shoot and get knocked off your feet just as you're about to let loose. Sure, it feels good on the other side of the ice, but the thrill fades quickly. A well-executed poke check or blocked shot has the same appeal, just not as much crunch.   That is a lot of criticism, but NHL does do a lot of things right. First off, it can be a very fun game. Whether playing alone or against a human opponent, the game produces a lot of tense, exciting moments, and the big hits and big scores can be quite enjoyable, as long as they aren't occurring every five seconds. One of the new wrinkles -- a context-sensitive wraparound goal -- feels exceptionally good. It's implemented in much the same way as NHL Hitz Pro's from last year. Get behind the goal, begin coming to the front, and press the shoot button to unleash an automatic wrap attempt. There's nothing quite as rewarding as sneaking one in on the wraparound late in the game to win.    Which leads to the next point... NHL 2005 actually does a good job of limiting scores (on the default difficulty and higher) this year as well. In the last couple of seasons, it was too easy to score too often. This time around, the goalie AI has been tweaked. Not only do the goaltenders make the big, exciting plays, but they actually play a good positional game. They move well, cover well, and give up fewer rebounds than in years past.    As a result of the tightened defense and goalie AI, sometimes in order to score, you'll need to screen the goalie or get something working away from the puck. To help do that, there is off-the-puck control. You can use this to switch off of the guy with the puck and set something else up -- like cutting to the goal to get in position for a rebound, drawing a defender, or setting yourself for a one-timer or deflection. While it doesn't always work (usually due to the excessive hitting), it is a nice addition. Almost as good as a wraparound is a late user-controlled deflection.   Another obvious thing NHL 2005 has going for it is its Dynasty Mode. With an intuitive interface, refined trading system and innumerable features, this is the smartest franchise mode we've seen yet in an EA hockey title. One of the coolest elements of it is the Edit Lines feature. As we all know, plopping a bunch of superstars together on the ice does not a good team make. They have to be arranged, assuaged and otherwise finessed into performing well as a unit. EA knows this too, so in addition to thinking about how to juggle scoring combinations, as a GM you have to make decisions based on chemistry and try to create the best mix. Your hard work tweaking lines actually has a real benefit on the ice, as a happier, more in-tune line will create more opportunities for your team.   Click For More Images Some of the other elements feel a lot like the Owner ideas in the Madden franchise. For instance, while managing finances might not seem fun to some people, it can actually work to your advantage in this game. If you're all about profit and don't pay attention to ticket prices and such, your fan loyalty will plummet, and you can actually lose your home ice advantage. Make sure your fans are pleased and your players will receive a boost.   For those who like to manage things from a coaching level, the Dynasty offers plenty of enjoyment there as well. By setting up practices before each game, you can earn situational bonuses for your team. Neglect your practices and you could be looking at an unprepared squad. Fun challenges like these within the Dynasty framework make this year's mode more enjoyable and lasting than the previous couple of seasons.   In addition to Franchise, the World Cup offering is also impressive. This year's game allows you to play the full-format World Cup and relive Canadian glory in the process (or crush their hopes, whatever helps you sleep at night). You can also play in one of three Elite Leagues from around the world, which can provide some added enjoyment for lovers of the esoteric or international.   More for the masses is the wide-open multiplayer Free-4-All mode. This gives up to four players the opportunity to shoot on one goalie, battling to see who can get to the set amount of goals first. This is a frantic party game that begs for four-player involvement. In fact, among friends, it just may be the most popular mode in the game.   Presentation of NHL 2005 is also excellent. More than almost any sports game on the market, the menus are laid out intuitively and are easy to manage, and a lot of information is presented at once. The PDA innovation in Franchise;although borrowed from the ESPN series, is actually implemented better by EA (as it was in Madden). But that's not where it ends.    The graphics have received an upgrade over last year, especially in the face department. If you know hockey, you'll know exactly who you're looking at any moment, whether it be Jarome Iginla or referee Kerry Frasier. Yep, even 'Ol Bulletproof Hair got modeled.    Between plays and after goals, the cut scenes and replays are handled well. There are some nice details as you get in close, like players chewing gum, smiling after scoring and goalies banging the ice in frustration. Bench shots, including coach interaction with players and assistants, are also well done.    Aside from the faces, the player models themselves are good but not great. There are more animations than ever before, and EA has employed multiple people in their motion capture, so there are some really cool, realistic-looking moments, especially when play congests in front of the goal. In addition, all of the hit and puck interaction animations have been tweaked.    For instance, if a little guy like St. Louis tries to take on a bruiser, he could slough off on the check. In years past, the big guy would have either unrealistically gone to the ice or (equally unrealistically) not registered that anyone touched him at all. Now players react to nearly every hit, big or small, which lends a chippier, more believable series of animations to the action.   In recent years, commentary has not been great, and this year is passable but not exciting. The announcers do their jobs, but don't offer the depth of analysis nor the variety needed to be truly compelling. Luckily, the rest of the sound effects are spot-on, and as much as the hits are over-the-top and all-too-frequent, the crunching sounds really help to convey a sense of collision.   In addition, EA Trax has come through with a pretty decent soundtrack. The highlight is a Rhino selection, Faith No More's ~From Out of Nowhere.~ Although we could have stood for more tracks overall, what's here is entertaining.What are you looking for in a hockey game? If you're looking for a raw, wide-open experience with lots of arcade elements, NHL 2005 is for you. It has lots of immediate pick-up-and-play potential for those just acquainting themselves with the sport, or for those who like their hockey big, fast and bloody. If you're more into the strategy of real hockeythe poke checks, the traps, the dumps, the dekes -- then you'll either have to try to design this game to fit your tastes (which can be frustrating) or go elsewhere.EA is well-known for delivering some of the most well-rounded sports games on the market. But in this case, although a lot of the other pieces are in place -- Franchise, modes, and presentation -- the final product is a little light on gameplay. It doesn't bring enough to the rink to compete with ESPN NHL 2K5, a product that shipped first and costs $30 less.", "date": "Sep 21, 2004"}
