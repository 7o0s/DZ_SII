It's also a good way of describing NAM, a first person shooter from GT Interactive, as the game is also a big sloppy mess.  NAM uses the Build engine from 3D Realms, which you may remember from such titles as Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage, Powerslave and more. I've played all of those old games, and NAM is easily the ugliest and worst implementation of the Build engine I've ever seen, except for perhaps some early Capstone outings like Witchaven or Tek War [Editor's note  nope, NAM's even worse than those games...]. Although I firmly believe that gameplay is far more important than graphics, it's hard not to notice that the Build engine is now a couple years old, and it shows in every blocky pixel.  A big problem is that the Vietnam War was fought mainly in jungles and rice paddies. No game engine is very good at handling outdoor areas, especially complex areas with a lot of foliage and trees. The Build engine simply can't convey in any sense an outdoor, jungle environment.  NAM strives for realism, and bills itself on the back of the box as having ~the intense action and real ambience of the Vietnam War~ and ~true-to-war tactics.~ Though the game does use real weapons (M60, M16, etc.), it still follows the first person shooter design of one guy, a lot of health kits, and hordes of enemies, although it does offer some concessions to realism. For example, getting shot is pretty lethal, and you can bleed to death from your wounds. But even this is only a half step--medical kits still have the magical ability to instantly make you as good as new again.  There are some elements that do add to a Vietnam feel, like land mines, booby traps, and the occasional air strike. You can also find AI characters that follow you around on the map, like a radioman that calls in air strikes and a medic who can heal you on the go. Turrets in tanks can also be operated. The multiplayer modes include cooperative play, bot matches, and capture the flag, and indeed over half the maps are designed for the multiplayer game (leaving only 14 maps for single player gaming). This is all fine and good, but without built-in TCP/IP play ala Quake gamers will have to join a LAN gaming club, download Kali, or play modem-to-modem.  You should only consider picking this one up if you are still using a 486, or are so keen on playing a Vietnam War action game that you can close your eyes to the fact that the engine is horribly dated, and not implemented very well to begin with. You certainly shouldn't pay more than $20-$30 for it, as it is essentially a commercial Duke Nukem mod. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 13, 1998"}
