Now parked in the open lot of a N64 dry spell, Vigilante 8: Second Offense may not be likely to attract the same business it commanded on the PlayStation and Dreamcast, and the new additions to the series are gadgets and distractions rather than fundamental changes. Even so, you have to give respect to the game that erased the word Twisted Metal from our vocabulary, and the fact that V8 still rocks despite competing in a procession that's dragging a trailer full of dead ponies is a testament to the brilliance of the first game and the furthering thrill of its sequel. Gameplay Car combat is a self-explanatory genre: car combat. If you're looking for a storyline in your gameplay, you're in for a world of ~What-The-Hell?~ in Vigilante 8: Second Offense. V8 tried to break away from the mindless, repetitive destruction of Twisted Metal by adding missions to the battles in single player mode. Second Offense follows the same path, but the plot is so convoluted and ramrodded that the goals make no sense -- collect briefcases, derail trains, protect astronomical observatories... Why, we don't know. Perhaps it has to do with the plot, which is something about Mad Max / Shaft hybrid jarheads who've traveled back in time to annihilate a newlywed couple (in the future, weddings apparently tick people off). Obviously, the story wasn't as paramount as it was in the PC games Interstate '76 and '82. Still, the interwoven goals provide added replay for each character.  But seriously -- Who cares about storyline when you've got an El Guerro with a missile launcher strapped to the roof? This game is about grinding steel, and the carnage here stands up well again this year. There aren't a lot of differences between Vigilante 8: Second Offense and its predecessor -- just more of what made the first game great. Eighteen cars are in this year, up from 12 last time, but there are only 12 levels (two less than last year). However, those levels are vast and jam-packed, with all kinds of modern architecture to level. Many stages contain hidden and yet natural additions that affect gameplay, such as the bobsled run and ski jump that you can compete in on the ski resort area, or the rocket silo that sends cars spiraling into space on the NASA stage. Other rounds, like the first game, are simply all about dropping buildings on opponents. Many of these special stage features add to the chaos of multiplayer gaming, making the multiplayer mode a battle against both man and environment.  This year's collection of cars improves much over last year's solid line-up, with more oddities such as the tipsy Dakota Stunt Cycle (yes, a motorbike in a car combat game) and the Moon Trekker (which has an independent suspension system that feels like the car is steering from its center). Every weapon has four combo attacks now (up from two), which expands the number of attacks available as weapons take on alternative purposes or powers at the expense of ammo -- a missile can attach to your car and give you a speed burst, a mortar may be boosted to cause an earthquake.   My issues with the game are few, but they're the same problems we had with the first V8 that should have been fixed. The mission objectives are still sloppy, so it will take a few plays through to understand what to do, and even then you'll have no idea why the objective is necessary -- you just need to do it. Control is also buggy at times. Cars still pass through each other when pushing against each other, which helps avoid cheap damage but also ruins the integrity of the game.   Gameplay is still as good as last year, but the new additions to the cars (the hover mode and water transformations) are a bit problematic. Although it looks cool, controlling the hover car is more of a chore than a joy (especially since it's almost impossible to aim when hovering), and the water modification sometimes glitches when out of the water (not transforming fast enough to stay in the action). These improvements have made the game even more prone to either errors, aggravation, or (most often) both. Graphics Luxoflux, V8's designers, attempted to make this second game more uniform across all platforms, which is a very good thing considering that this year the benchmark wasn't N64 performance but rather the more powerful Dreamcast. That means that Luxoflux overextended themselves on the N64 while aiming for Dreamcast quality, and the system seemed to be able to catch up with their ambitions. V8 2nd on N64 is so sharp and fast that it can stand side-by-side with the Dreamcast game. While the original looked like an improved PS game, the new game features lighting effects on cars, vast draw distances, and complex level architecture. Everything explodes with magnificence, just like last time, only this year the framerate has been locked down better. Effects are pushed to the maximum, with gentle waves lapping the shores of beaches, sharks and ghosts prowling their respective turfs, rough seas tossing your skiboat vehicle, lights with sharp lens flares (the sun has its own heliosphere effect), and working gondolas, trucks, trains, boats, ect. One weapon sends ripples through the ground of the entire arena surface, like somebody had picked up the floor and shook it like a carpet. The tearing problems of the PlayStation game, which left a jagged impressionistic mess when up close on an object, don't factor in to this game, although the lack of texture space can be seen even though the game can be bumped up to an incredible ultra-high resolution setting (which is developer-English for high-res/640x480). Framerate is fairly solid throughout the single player game (there's a drop when you up the resolution, but the difference can be quickly overlooked once in battle). Multiplayer Where V8 matters most is in the multiplayer mode, and Second Offense comes off well. Two players can take on the game in a cooperative mode, teaming together to protect landmarks or ferreting out goodies. What's great about this is that the two player game looks as good, if not better in some cases, as the single player game, even though the screen is being split. The cars take only the slightest hit, but the texture fade-in effect that is quite prominent in single player suddenly makes less of an impact on half the screen. The four player battle mode is another story, and although the game is still playable, it's much slower and choppier than the standard game. Even so, all of the game's graphic effects and level features stay on, which often affects gameplay. Rippling in the water still bounces your floating car, while stage landmarks such as the pipe that can be pushed downhill still factor into play (a la Return of the Jedi's Ewok log trap). Against other players, you'll find these details make a much bigger impact than when playing alone, as smart players will set up traps in key areas. Sound The only difference between the Dreamcast and N64 game that really matters -- the soundtrack on the N64 just can't keep up. The game does have a host of funky voice samples and effects (the title theme, for example, still rocks), but they're noticeably fewer than the disc-based counterparts. While we weren't so bothered by the MIDI music soundtrack of this cart at first, we hadn't yet heard the funktastic tracks on the PlayStation and Dreamcast games. This version just does those tunes no justice and retains less of the flavor of those Seventies flashbacks --the wacca-chikka guitar, the funky blues, the Latin dance grooves. It just didn't make the conversion. The sounds are better this year, but these bloodless tunes are no substitute for the real '70s feel.  Without Twisted Metal on the Nintendo64 (which is a blessing), Vigilante reigns alone as king of car combat gaming. However, this was still a hard-fought crown, and the gameplay and amazing graphics are testament to that. As far as comparing the game across systems, the N64 version fares just as well as the Dreamcast game due to the sharp graphics and gameplay. It's certainly not as beautiful, but the difference is minimal, and the current drought of N64 games makes that difference moot. The only competition for this game is the original game, which almost fares better than the sequel because of how all the new power-ups are more frustrating than fun. Even so, the sequel is more feature-packed, looks better,  and offers the two-player cooperative mode. And the game is still fun, which is more than I can say for any other car combat sequel I've ever played.", "date": "Feb 2, 2000"}
