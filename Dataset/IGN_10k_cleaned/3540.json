The portable rendition was developed by JV Games, previously responsible for one of the first First-Person Shooters on the GBA, BackTrack. The development team obviously learned whatever lesson there was to be had in developing that awful game, because NightFire is a far, far better production. But even though this game is a better first-person shooter than what the team last did on the system, it still doesn't make it a great one; NightFire definitely has its moments, but several issues keep the game from being one of the GBA's top first-person shooters. Features Nine missions 25 sub-missions Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance NightFire is another challenging first-person shooter for the Game Boy Advance, putting players in the role of James Bond in more than nine levels and several sub-levels of action. While certainly emphasizing the shooting aspect of the FPS genre, the game also focuses a bit more on stealth and gadgetry use than other games in the genre. We're not going to go as far as saying that NightFire is the GBA equivalent of Metal Gear Solid, because it's not. Stealth missions are simple matters of staying at least six feet away from personnel, and most gadgets are of the point-and-shoot nature anyway...essentially just a different version of a gun.   Graphically and design-wise, NightFire on the Game Boy Advance is one of the most ambitious first-person shooters created for the handheld. JV Games built a true 3D engine for NightFire instead of going the traditional, more GBA-friendly raycasting direction; which means that, instead of ~faking~ a first-person engine like how Doom, Ecks vs. Sever and Duke Nukem Advance handle their imagery, NightFire features true texture-mapped polygons for the environment and key objects like vehicles and furniture. Characters and objects are, of course, sprites, but they don't seem out of place because it's how the other FPS titles handle items and enemies in the action. On the upside, this 3D engine means that the designers have a lot more freedom in level layout, as rooms can be stacked on other rooms, and terrain can gradually slope up or down. On the downside, the framerate, while fully playable, isn't exactly what one would call ~smooth.~ But one can certainly appreciate some of the elements that the programmer put to add a little atmosphere; the game actually features nifty lighting effects beyond the standard ~turn on/off illumination~, with spotlights actually casting gradual lighting against the floors and walls. Programming fakery or no, it's neat to see.  All of the missions are divided into two, three, or four sub-missions, all tied together with cutscenes lifted from the console versions of the game. In the Game Boy Advance version's case, cutscenes are simply still postage-sized screenshots that slide across the screen as the text unfolds the dialogue. Cartridge space, you know. However, unlike the console versions of NightFire, in the GBA edition if you die at any time during a mission, that's it. It's over, and it's right back to the beginning of the mission. This may seem like a downer of a ~feature,~ but since the sub-missions are relatively short, it's not too big of a drag to be forced into starting over from scratch.  But there are some serious design issues in NightFire that definitely hurt the enjoyment of the adventure. The controls, at least in mapping the four buttons to all the different things you can do, is perfectly competent, but how James Bond moves within his environment could have definitely been handled better. The designers went for what I'm guessing is an ~analog~ feel for the motions; hold the D-pad in a direction for a second and you'll move slowly, but keep it held and you'll move much quicker. This implementation makes the game feel ~gooey,~ because there's never a consistent speed to James Bond's movement since players are constantly pressing and releasing the D-pad during play. And the sloppy way that James Bond interacts with staircases seems to be a limitation of the game engine; players can run normal speed down staircases because the engine lets players ~fall~ off edges. But run back up, and it's slow and painful because the game has to sense the collision with the vertical surface, raise Bond up to the next step, sense the next collision, raise up, etc.  But probably the most important omission: there's no visual feedback for when you're being shot. It's great that the developers implemented projectile bullets as quick streaks to give players the proper direction of where shots are coming from, but it's not so great when you have no idea you're taking hits unless you're watching your tiny health meter dwindle in the corner of the screen. The screen doesn't flash, nor does your character get ~nudged~ when taking a hit. This makes playing conservatively a lot more difficult, since the game forces you to look in the corner to see if you're taking damage. NightFire isn't a bad shooter on the Game Boy Advance, because it's challenging and it features a lot of great ideas in graphic engines and character behavior on the handheld system. But a little more attention in character movement and hit detection would have made this Bond a much better product.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
