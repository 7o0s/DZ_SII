Someone's prayer has been answered.  Don't quite understand it, but Natsume has brought Harvest Moon 3 to the Game Boy Color.  I'm trying to figure out what's stranger: a farming simulator for a handheld, or that someone would be releasing a Game Boy Color game at a time when stores are clearing Game Boy stock to make room for Game Boy Advance merchandise. Features Play as a boy or girl Hidden mini-games Battery save Only for Game Boy Color  In Harvest Moon 3 you take role of the boy farmer, the hero of prior Harvest Moon adventures.  After winning acclaim for your past farming accomplishments, you have been asked to help the girl farmer get her farm, on an island, in working order.  The townsfolk have agreed to tend your farm while you help her, so off you go to the island to meet the girl and begin your next farming adventure. Harvest Moon 3 has some very strong elements that make this a well-produced game.  The graphics are bright, colorful, and highly detailed for an 8-bit handheld system.  The look is animated in style, not an attempt to create real-looking human beings and animals.  It does remind me of NES games of yore.  The NES had a very distinctive look to its games.  You could walk by an NES game playing on a TV screen and, without even knowing it was a Nintendo title, you would ask, ~Hey, what NES game are you playing?~  Harvest Moon 3 has the look of an NES title, and a lot of care was put into the look and movements of the animals and characters to make game more than just a simple port of its console cousins.   Gameplay is quite effective at communicating the feel of doing farm chores.  Chores are chores.  If they were fun, they'd be called play.  Harvest Moon 3 makes you go through all the necessary steps to get the farm ready harvesting and husbandry.  That includes clearing the fields of weeds, boulders, and tree stumps.  It requires hoeing, sowing, and watering those fields to get whatever it is you're growing to grow.  Make sure that the A button is in good working order, because you're about to put some mileage on it.  The work is laborious, but that is the point.  You do feel satisfaction after you've gotten the farm ready to go (grow?).  It's like getting the feel of a day's work on a farm, but without those pesky government subsidies getting in the way.   And there is a lot of depth to this little game.  It begins with choosing the name, sex (yes, you can play as either the boy or girl, each with specific tasks and abilities), and clothes of your character.  From there you move on to choosing a pet and entering your vitals (birthday, blood type).  The island has several destinations you can visit, such as a cliff, forest, grassland, mountain, and village.  You can interact with the village inhabitants, and when the time comes, you can take the ferry back to the mainland, where you can buy supplies or shop at the mall, get a job, see a movie, even visit an aquarium.  My negatives have to begin with the sound in Harvest Moon 3, or lack of effective or varied sounds.  Try as it might, the various sound effects just aren't enough for them to be anything but annoying.  Each season has its own song...that plays, and plays, and plays.  And the sound of rain in Harvest Moon 3 (white noise) will leave you begging for it to stop if it lasts for more than one game day.  An 8-bit handheld can only do so much with one dime-sized speaker, but it you're unable to do more with the game sound other than a repetitive song and white noise, at least give me the option of turning it off.   The other weak point of the game comes from the real strength of the game; its depth of simulation.  Since I was just beginning the game, my crops were small.  But once I was done tending to the fields, I had nothing else to do for my game day.  I had to wait for the crops to grow, which could take seven game days or more, and I couldn't buy more seed until I had sold my crops.  I found myself putting my character to bed at 2pm on more than one occasion to get the game day to pass to the next day.  Wanting to visit the mainland for seeds or supplies became a lesson in patience and luck, as there were only two days to go by ferry, and it seemed it was always raining or snowing on one of those days.  And if you plant certain crops a day or two before the season change...the season those crops won't grow, you can have an entire harvest wiped out.  Harvest Moon 3 comes with adequate directions to get you started, but it is instances like that that show the creators of the game are relying on prior knowledge to play.  NEVER PROGRAM A GAME ASSUMING THE PLAYER HAS PLAYED PREVIOUS VERSIONS! Assuming a prior knowledge of controls or game play boundaries only causes frustration and annoyance for the game player, and can turn him off to playing the title further, or playing any more titles in a game series. Harvest Moon 3 has a lot going for it.  Colorful graphics, original game play, a tremendous amount of depth for a handheld title.  It has a delightful look reminiscent of old NES titles, a friendly enough control system for a person of almost any age to master, and the replay value of a title like this is quite high.  My sticking points are that a game of this length is cumbersome on a handheld, the sound effects are limited at best, and the depth of play can be a hindrance to a speedier or better-paced progression of the game.  I think the limitations imposed by the system's design will prevent people from enjoying this game to the fullest, both in sound and extended game play, and unless you are a big fan of this series, or are really searching for something new in the simulation arena, most people are just not going to be jived about a faming sim for their Game Boy Color.", "date": "Jan 16, 2002"}
