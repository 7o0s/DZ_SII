{"name": "Warlords III: Darklords Rising", "name_review": "Warlords III: Dark Lords Rising", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/03/warlords-iii-dark-lords-rising", "text": "Warlords III actually came out last year; Warlords III: Darklords Rising is a deluxe edition of the previous game. It's a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world of elves and orcs, and gameplay revolves around holding on to cities, raising armies, then expanding out across the map to take control of more cities. Individual heroes who can complete quests and use spells and magic items add to the strategic options.  This expanded version adds four new campaigns, more than a dozen new scenarios, a whole slew of new units, spells and heroes, and a lot of new multiplayer game variants. It also includes a full-blown scenario and campaign editor, which is probably worth the price of admission alone for the hardcore Warlords fans out there.  With these editors, you can create individual scenarios or sets of linked scenarios, recreating any epic fantasy battle you please. The editor includes a mapmaking tool, a unit editor, and lets you select the races and units for each side to play. You can even customize the text for each city or ruin discovered, for magic items, and for the storylines within each campaign. Strangely though, while the units can be edited, the heroes can't.  Since Warlords III is such a good game, folks who missed it the first time around should definitely consider picking this one up, particularly if they're fans of turn-based strategy games. For those who've already shelled out for Warlords III, it will be a slightly tougher decision, but if Red Orb offers some sort of discount or rebate to owners of the previous game, that decision should become a lot easier. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Sep 3, 1998"}
