Carnival Games, which attempts to capture the magic of the midway, isn't even mediocre, it's tragic.   Wha' happened?   The concept is actually solid -- a midway-style collection of minigames is perfect for mobile. And DChoc juices the idea with a cool trophy case of stuffed animals and other prizes won by trying out the various games on the virtual midway. But the execution is weak. There are a ton of midway games to choose from, but this game only includes a small handful: Coin Push, Test of Strength, Claw of Destiny, and Duck Shoot. There are a couple of non-games, too, such as a fortune teller and a spinning wheel where one can hope to win random prizes. You simply agree to spend a ticket, press OK to spin the wheel, and hope. Zzzz. Where's the ring toss? Milk bottles? Basketball free throws? Balloon darts?   The mechanics of the minigame aren't remotely engaging. The worst offender is Coin Push. You drop tokens into a machine, one at a time, in hopes to create enough of a build up that a special token in the pile is eventually pushed over the edge of the screen. Boring. The claw game is far too easy -- after just two tries, I was grabbing prizes every time I tried it. Duck Shoot is borderline decent, as you press one of three buttons to shoot metal ducks that cross the screen, avoiding those holding a white flag. Finally, Test Your Strength tasks you with hitting buttons in rhythm to fill up a power meter before slamming a hammer down on a peg.   I assumed that after trying these four games and handily beating them, I would unlock more minigames. Nope. What you see is what you get -- and I see a poor value.   Not only are none of the minigames particularly fun, but some of them are downright unattractive to look at. This cannot be the same company that crated the colorful Tornado Mania. Coin Push and Test Your Strength are just bland. And the world screen, where you direct a family around the fairgrounds, is just ugly. It screams at you in pure yellow. No whimsical stands? Where are those cool little characters that DChoc is known for? At least the music is right on -- the calliope-like soundtrack is entirely appropriate.  Wow. Well, I knew the day I totally slagged a Digital Chocolate game was coming -- but I didn't expect Carnival Games to usher it in. The midway is fertile ground, so I expected DChoc to work another minor masterpiece. This is a dreadfully missed opportunity that I hope another publisher jumps all over, because mobile deserves a cool carnival-style game. Oh well, at least the game is ctional. Notice I left out the ~fun?~ So did Digital Chocolate.", "date": "Aug 2, 2007"}
