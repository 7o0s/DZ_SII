Already invaded by such previously exclusive titles like Code: Veronica and Headhunter, and soon to be host to a redone version of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legacy has already been established. It's no real surprise then to see Infogrames taking advantage of the precedent and repackaging one of its more popular DC titles, Looney Tunes Space Race.   A strong seller for cart fans and young children on Sega's former powerhouse, Space Race was a great-looking cell-shaded achievement when it first appeared nearly two years ago. But with today's improvements in the visual world and expectations at an all time high, a simple port of an older Dreamcast game doesn't necessarily mean it's an automatic ~9~ (as our Dreamcast editors scored it two Novembers ago). So how does it stack up all this time later? Let's explore.   Featuressize=5>  For people looking for a lot to do, this is your game. An overabundance of modes including one that wasn't in the Dreamcast version has returned for your cartoon racing pleasure. The standard Time Trial option that all driving games seem to have is in there too, as is the expected quick race mode and a four-player multi-person extravaganza.   One of Space Race's strongest points has to be its cool Event option. Placing a Looney Tunes character of your choice into a race with a sub-set of special rules and objectives to accomplish, the Event mode puts a slight twist on the usual ~re-race this track you've seen before~ angle, and is a quick way to earn those much needed ACME Tokens (more on that later). Curiously, there are slightly fewer events to complete in the PlayStation 2 version that were present in the Dreamcast rev.   Additionally, there's an all-new feature exclusive to the PS2 system that we hadn't seen before. Known as Tournament mode, it collects multiple tracks into groups that accumulate placing points (similar to Mario Kart) for an overall winner at the end. Whoever wins the tournament gets a bunch of tokens, which can then be spent unlocking many of the game's big secrets including character art, player animations, and even a movie starring the Looney Tunes gang.   Overall, there is plenty to play for with a myriad of popular hidden characters to race as. Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd, and plenty of other famous personalities that we all grew up with inhabit the selection screen like roaches, and ensure that there's plenty of variety to choose from.   Graphicssize=5>  For naysayers out there that didn't think that the PlayStation 2 could handle the game as well as the video memory monster that was the Dreamcast, you're in for a surprise: as it does. In fact, the frame rate has been improved upon and could quite possibly hit the mark a full 10 frames faster than its older cousin. Even when jetting through four-player mode we couldn't find any chunking at all (until we added CPU racers to the mix, and even then it was pretty smooth). It all came at a price however; as it appeared that many of the background objects from the Dreamcast disc didn't make it into this version.   Top of the line when introduced two years ago, the excellent cell-shaded models are still impressive. Truly combining the classic 2D look with modern day 3D characters, Space Race does a great job of convincing us that these cartoon personalities have come to life. Individual animations and specialized trademarks in particular help take the presentation a step further. Be it Wile E. Coyote, Bugs Bunny, or Yosemite Sam, each character is modeled directly from the Warner Bros. Cartoons.   Gameplaysize=5>  Unfortunately, the variety that's available to us in terms of character selection doesn't necessarily translate well into gameplay. While each racer can be handled with the familiar shoulder button 'accelerate and brake combo' and special moves and turbo boosts are executed through face buttons, the differences between characters cannot be felt.   Choosing Elmer Fudd over Daffy Duck makes little difference in terms of handling and speed of your vehicle when compared to other games in the genre. Instead of vast chasms of individuality that we'd find when comparing say Donkey Kong and Toad in the Mario Kart series, we're left with changes so minute they appear aesthetic instead of significant.   Not to say that the core gameplay isn't pretty good, because it is. There's a very intuitive handling system in there, which makes it easy to get into any given race. Four-player games in particular can get pretty hectic with you and your buddies all vying for the first place finish. What we couldnt figure out though is why when using the multitap, the race ends as soon as somebody finishes. Second and Third place finishes aren't aloud which we found pretty strange. For the ultimate in fun however, play with four controllers and CPU opponents turned on. The action is rougher, more intense, and full of surprises.   Unfortunately, what keeps Looney Tunes from becoming a truly great cart racer is the monotony of it all. While the tracks are put together well in terms of structure, the obstacles and turns inside each are similar to all the other stages. Backgrounds and themes may change, but the feeling that you've done this all before hits you likes a ton of bricks.Not a bad game by any means, Looney Tunes Space Race is one of those types of games that could be great fun for about half an hour: until you observe all its limitations. Packed full of features and modes, it's only a matter of time before the realization of doing the same thing over and over again hits you. Presented without any flaws, we could see how fans of the old school cartoons and young children alike could really dig it.But for those of us who are looking for something beyond a hearty rental, Space Race falls a little short. Dated not at all in a visual sense but more so in terms of the depth of gameplay, Melbourne House and Infogrames has a solid performer here, but not enough to keep us playing in the long run.", "date": "May 30, 2002"}
