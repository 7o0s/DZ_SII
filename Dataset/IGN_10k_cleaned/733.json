There's nothing quite like pretending you're Mad Max and blasting away with a big ole shotgun. It's the middle of a vast, post-apocalyptic desert, and gas-hungry thugs are everywhere! You climb in your V-8 Interceptor, your trusty dog by your side, and... Oh jeez, where was I? Oh yeah, Crypt Killer. Sorry.  It's standard light gun fare: you're tracked forward on rails while the camera pans around, revealing wave upon wave of horror-themed bad guys to shoot. You've got skeletons, zombies, spiders, rats, and water (yes, there really is water that comes up and tries to get you). At the end of each wave, you can choose from two paths, which is actually pretty cool.  Premise aside, though, the home version really disappointing. For starters, the graphics are deplorable. The pixelization on close-up images is just horrible. This game is crying out for anti-aliasing. The pop-up is also pretty bad, considering most of the game is indoors.  Some baddies throw projectiles at you, like swords or bones. However, when you blast an enemy their parts go bouncing all around, which makes it difficult to determine which piece of bone is really the projectile. There are also no 'innocent bystanders,' like in the PlayStation's other big shooter Area 51. All you can do in Crypt Killer is shoot, shoot, shoot, and believe me this grows tiresome after awhile.  Crypt Killer may do well because there is a shortage of light gun games for the PlayStation, with Area 51 being the only real other alternative. Do yourself a favor, and wait for Time Crisis later this year.", "date": "Mar 8, 1997"}
