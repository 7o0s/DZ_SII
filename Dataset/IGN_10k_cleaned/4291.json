Designed on the PC and then ported over to the Xbox and PS2, both Max Payne and the sequel, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, deliver impressive levels of style and story-telling, kick-ass action, and easily the best Bullet Time in any videogame around.    In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the Max Payne series is one of my favorite action games on the PC or Xbox, and that's saying a lot. But like I said, I'm writing about the PS2 version, and I'm torn. After having seen and played the generally excellent PC version, and the near duplicate Xbox version, the PS2 version -- while exactly the same in content -- suffers from being a tough-to-recommend port.    I'll get into the details soon enough, but let me put it straight to you. If you own a PC or Xbox, get Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne and have a blast. It's a stylish noir story told with an enviable amount of style and panache - and it absolutely teems with intense blasting action. If you own all three systems, just skip the PS2 version. Comparing them side by side will hurt your eyes, drop your jaw in disbelief, and make you genuinely wonder what the hell happened. Now, if you only own a PlayStation 2 and you love action games (and you dig action games with great stories) get this game or rent it, but be warned, it's inferior to its cousins in every way.    Presentation  The second in the series, Remedy's Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne brings gamers one of the best told stories in straight action form on any system. Remedy's hard-boiled shooter brandishes a comic-book cell style of storytelling combined with a deadpan monologue by lead character Max Payne (reminiscent of film noir movies and books of the late '40s and '50s) that sets a distinct tone for the entirety of the game. It's so well handled, carefully paced and so artfully imagined, that Max Payne 2, which is one of the few games to merge these two seemingly close mediums, has become the near flawless embodiment of how to fuse the two the right way.   The story is classic hard-boiled fiction. It follows troubled New York cop Max Payne, who lost his wife and child in the first game. In his debut, the distraught husband and father sought vengeance and justice from those who slaughtered his innocent family, and in most respects he got it. In Max Payne 2, he returns to his role as the toughest cop on organized crime in NY, but he's caught in the classic trap of femme fatale love with the sleek hit-woman Mona Sax, who he must protect while solving a case in which she's the main suspect.    At first the narrative is a little abrupt because it's told out of order (similar to the way Pulp Fiction is handled), and because of Remedy's addiction to psychedelic/troubling dream sequences. But as players step into the thick metaphors and dripping analogies, they'll learn what's really going on. One of the things players will notice this time around is the cutscenes are more heavily integrated into the gameplay scenarios, breaking up the action, but also fusing the two together more solidly.    Just like in the original, Remedy's sequel is filled with conspiracy theories, allusions to the classics, and questions about the meaning of love, the battle of good and evil in the heart of every living human, and what, in the end, our small lives really end up meaning. For a game that's mostly a bunch of bullets whizzing through the air, it's a delight to see how much depth the story offers. Of course, Max Payne 2 is more focused on the love story of Max and Mona and less on Nordic religious sects and the evil of corporate crime, but the sap is easily kept in line. After all, the rest of the pulpy dialogue makes the generally good love story look just fine.   Remedy also does a superb job of laying down a heavy, seemingly important story while constantly slipping in gameplay situations with humorous TV shows (Baseball Bat Boy, Dick Justice and Lords and Ladies), sly billboard ads and some of the funniest dialog this side Giants, Monkey Island and Sam and Max. I can't even count the times I laughed out loud, but the single, four-minute conversation between a policeman and a convicted V-addict talking about whether he chain-sawed his wife and the pizza delivery boy goes right up there with very best pieces of dialog in a videogames ever. Then there's the whole videogames-on-violence conversation between a women who's scared that her ex is going to kill her because he's played too many videogames. (But hey, she did through the TV out the window, which is a pretty big criminal offense!) Heck, there really are a handful of excellent lines. The only thing that hurts the presentation are the many, many 20-30 second long load times (which are super quick on the PC and Xbox), and the lack of a quicksave option.    Gameplay  The big changes to Max Payne 2 are rather subtle at first. Remedy is using the sturdy Havoc engine, which means the physics are more enhanced in every way possible. The main manifestations of the engine aren't utilized all that much, at least upon first inspection. What players first see are tons of debris. There are hundreds of bottles, canisters, and barrels lying around just waiting to be bumped. I was surprised that the use of the engine didn't also flow into the area of enemy AI, especially with regard to sound. As a result, so many of the scripted events feel stilted. In the high rent apartment levels, I could make a huge racket below some stairs by knocking over lamps and the like (or even with a shotgun), but it was only when I appeared in sight of the enemies that they came charging after me.    Where the physics manifest best are when Payne leaps into Bullet Time and ShootDodge, which by the way, have both been far better incorporated into the game than before. In the first game, Payne would leap onto his side while shooting and then automatically jump his feet. Now using Bullet Time (L2), he'll jump, hit the ground, and continue sliding. It sounds like nothing at first, but it works out tremendously well. First, he's a harder target to hit, which is a defensive bonus. The jumps are longer, which in turn extends the tension of the moment, and you can now use the surroundings better as you plan out your Bullet Time leaps.    The more important extra is that Bullet Time is deeper than before. Again, it's pretty subtle, but as Payne cleans up a crew of thugs successfully, the enemies will actually slow down even more, getting him deeper into the ~zone.~ Later in the game, this effect is clearer. Also, it should be known that Bullet Time in either form is far more necessary than before. You'll need it right away to fight enemies, which carry heavier guns in greater numbers than before.    As in the first, there is also the ~second~ form of Bullet Time, Shootdodge. By pressing a second button (L1), players enter into Bullet Time without jumping. Payne and Sax can run into Bullet Time, which slows down the enemy's actions and amplifies yours, walk around a gang of Squeaky Cleaning thugs, and blast them in a ring of fire.    What hampers the game so badly isn't the story, the style in which it's told, or the well-developed characters. It's technical stuff. Max Payne 2 was designed to play on a PC first, and as everyone knows by now, the PS2 is not a PC-friendly post console. As excellent PC games such as Deus Ex, No One Lives Forever and Soldier of Fortune have taught us all, porting a game to the PS2 requires lots of time, usually a lot of code rewriting, and sometimes it's just better to start a game over from scrap. I'm not saying I know exactly what Remedy did, but I do know that it looks and plays like, and Max Payne 2 looks like a quickly ported game.     The result is that the rough edges are everywhere -- and they affect both graphics and gameplay. They're mainly showcased in the rampantly inconsistent framerate and in a handful of other technical areas. Dozens of situations appear when Payne (or the second playable character, Mona) pull a 180-degree turn in a medium-sized room with not a single person around and the engine chops like a slow motion Benihana chef. When any number of characters appear on screen, diving, shooting, or even walking, the resolution drops, the frames drop, and the whole game looks like it's on drugs underwater. The gameplay is by no means ruined. Just like in the original PS2 version, this sequel functions well enough to get across the action, suspense and enhanced Bullet Time over well, but it's severely hampered. And it looks real bad.   Other disturbing technicalities clash with the flow of the stylish narrative and superb action. At any time during the game (and I was playing a fully boxed copy on a regular, unchipped PS2 system, mind you), an action scene will end and transition into a cutscene. The framerate drastically stutters, the game appears to be crashing, and then a long cutscene appears to ease your pain. These transitions are not apparent on the PC or Xbox versions.    Similar to the first PS2 version of Max Payne, the PS2 sequel has been spliced up into smaller chunks so as to deal with the PS's many processors and harder-to-squeak-out RAM. This means 20-30 second load times on the PS2, tons of them (where there were few to none on the PC version), and levels that are chopped up into smaller parts to accommodate the PS2. PS2 gamers also don't get the options of quicksaves like the other systems.    In short, it hurts to see such an otherwise stylish game get thrashed so badly in the port process. If it's a matter of waiting, then gamers, in my humble opinion, would rather wait for a smoother, prettier version of the game then a seemingly rushed, badly bruised Christmas version. So, like I said, if you have those other systems...    Graphics  Max Payne 2, like the first, offers a unique brand of visuals. Payne is an ordinary guy, so he looks pretty normal in dress, facial structure and stature. Remedy has done an excellent job of updating the characters' visuals, and you'll instantly see the better textured facial visuals on Payne, who looks a whole lot different; and you'll quickly recognize his creased leather jacket too.    The game's other textures aren't so much drastically enhanced as they are just very well used. For instance, while Mona and Max are far better looking than the other characters, which is a little weird, the levels prove to be fascinating because of their structure. Mona hides out in a fun house on Coney Island and the layout of this particular level is mind-altering without being painful to play through. The dozens of 2D characters, moving cars, spinning rooms, and funhouse theme objects create a surprisingly wild sense of exploration.   Technically, the PS2 version doesn't hold a candle to its PC or Xbox brethren in resolution, framerates, or aliasing, which is heavy here, but the Max Payne series was never a graphics demo piece. It gets its beauty from other places. Gamers with widescreen TVs are given the widescreen option, as well as some fun options for their reticules.    Sound  The dialogue, like I said before, is comic brilliance. The TV shows, especially, Lords and Ladies and Dick Justice are these strangely calm breaks between intense gun-toting scenes of grisly violence and death, and they point out the absurdity of Max's situation with even stronger clarify that his often lengthy monologues.    As music goes, the theme song here will stay with you a long time. The heavy emphasis on classic strings is thick and melodramatic, but it perfectly sets the stage for Max's seemingly unending set of failures and stubborn returns. I love the classic touch in Max Payne. More game companies should take a lesson from Max Payne's original soundtrack, which deftly avoids techno and licensed rock. Wow!    Another set of technical problems appear in the sound department. I found is that characters often repeat words. They'll stutter. Also, while playing as Mona, Max Payne's voice is injected in several areas. He says ~Careful.~ And in these cases, he was not talking to her over the headset. This is the exact same line he says to himself when encountering an interesting or dangerous situation. I think that everything has been pretty much laid straight. Remedy's Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a good sequel but not a great one. Bullet Time has been enhanced, the graphics have been updated, and the story, and its presentation, is superb. The minimalization of the agonizing dream sequences have been handled well (i.e., made less agonizing), and some of these levels, especially the construction yard mission, are superbly done. The addition of a new player adds an interesting twist to the gameplay, but it's not any kind of major revelation. But that's what Max Payne 2 turns out to be, an Interesting twist on the same solid Max Payne original. The addition of the mode Dead Man Walking is also nice, but hardly the equivalent of say, two-player coop or online play. The Max Payne series is perfectly primed for major expansions, but the lean, linear direction of this sequel doesn't seem to point to a major expansion of that type. And finally, the PC and Xbox versions are just plain better than the PS2 version, which at best is a fun, sometimes brilliant action game hampered by a shoddy porting job that leaves many technical aspects of the game in question. Rollercoaster-like framerates, weird technical glitches, and sound problems are layered upon long load times, and fewer options for the PS2 owner. Also, while it's been said before, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is short, easily beaten in seven to nine hours tops.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
