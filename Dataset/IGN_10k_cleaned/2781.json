You have beaten the game, you've completed every challenge and unlocked everything there is to do -- and then the sequel hits the market about a year later. The original was great, so buying the sequel is a no-brainer. Now, if you own multiple consoles, you're probably going to get the version for the more powerful platform, right? Well, consider yourself lucky that you decided to read this review before going out and putting down your cash for F1 2002 for GameCube -- because if you own F1 2001 for the PS2 or the Xbox, you'll be in for a little surprise. F1 2002 for GameCube is a port of F1 2001. It is not the same game as F1 2002 for PlayStation 2, which was released at the same time.   Visual Sciences, the same guys that ported an upgraded version of F1 2001 to Xbox last year, basically took the code for the PS2 version and moved it to GameCube, ignoring any additions that EA made to this year's PS2 game. That's both good and bad. Good, because F1 2002 for PS2 is actually a worse game than F1 2001. Bad, because I just spent $50 on a game we already played to death. To keep with the spirit of things, the following review is based on my F1 2001 Xbox review from last year, updated with specifics about the GameCube version.  Features  The First Formula One racer for GameCube Port of F1 2001 (PS2 version) updated with the new Toyota and Renault teams, Mika Salo, Alan McNish, Takuma Sato, Felipe Massa, Mark Webber and the latest driver moves - Kimi Raikonnen at McLaren, Jarno Trulli at Renault and Giancarlo Fisichella at Jordan  Challenge Mode teaches players the ropes via different driver challenges Grand Prix, Full and Custom Championship, Teammate Challenge, and Domination modes Four-player split-screen multiplayer modes: Time Challenge, Tag Team, Advantage, and Last Man Standing Changing weather, crew radio, 22-man pits, and all 17 tracks of the F1 2002 season Widescreen mode for 16x9 TV sets     Gameplay Like the PS2 version it's based on, F1 2002 lets you pick from all 22 drivers and 11 teams of the current Formula One season, complete with up-to-date sponsor decals (minus cigarette advertisers, of course), and take them through the complete 17-track Grand Prix. In case you haven't played the game yet, know that F1 2002 is somewhat of a beginner's game that tries to introducing Europe's, South America's, and Japan's most popular racing sport to a US audience. So before you get to experience what it feels like to floor your gas pedal on the Hockenheim Ring or navigate the winding streets of Monte Carlo, your first stop is most likely going to be F1 2002's Challenge Mode. Get this: before you can drive a complete championship or even switch gears to manual you have to prove that you can do it. I have to admit that when I first played the game last year, I was dumbfounded. ~I can't drive a full championship on manual with FIA rules, random weather, and car damage without having to complete license tests? Hello, EA, there are some people who have played F1 racing games before, you know...~ Don't worry, it sounds more annoying than it really is.    Have you played F1 2001 for PS2 or Xbox? Although primarily designed to protect beginners from getting confused by all the setup options, the Challenge Mode actually turns into a fun little bonus that helps you familiarize yourself with the controls and feature list. For example, earning the ability to pick manual gear shifting will take a normal player something like two minutes. Simply go to the Manual Transmission challenge and complete it within the specified time limit and you're done. Depending on your completion time, you are then awarded a medal (bronze, silver, gold) and your overall progress percentage goes up. Want to play with car damage? Complete a challenge in which you must drive a car with a damaged front wing back to the pits. You can even drive a track experience challenge on each track that disqualifies you if you leave the track. Opening up all the options should be a cinch for anyone with a little bit of F1 (game) racing experience, but you'll have to work hard if you want to get gold medals on all challenges. Apart from basic gameplay options, completing challenges also opens additional Grand Prix modes, like Custom Championship, Full Championship, Teammate Challenge, or the expert Domination mode that requires you to grab pole for every race. For those who haven't played F1 2001, the Challenge Mode is actually a worthwhile feature -- but I have to say that after having played both the PS2 and Xbox incarnations of this title, the option to bypass this beginner's setup would have come a long way. Just have the game ask something along the lines of ~are you new to F1 racing?~ when you initially boot it up.      The core of the game of course remains the Full Championship. But where F1 2001 did an admirable job at recreating the weekend event for each race with color commentary by ITV's Jim Rosenthal, GameCube players only get a silent track flyby. Since the PS2 game shipped on a CD and GameCube disks hold almost three times as much data, the old ~not enough room for audio~ excuse doesn't fly here. Once you get past the track intro, players have their choice of driving a few practice laps, qualifying, warm-up, or can jump right to Sunday's GP race. While practice and warm-up are all about setting up your car (via text-only menus that get the job done but won't win any awards for presentation), EA did a great job at making the qualifying session as fun as the final race. Like in real life, you can expect traffic on the track as the other drivers leave the pits to qualify. You have one hour to drive your best lap time and achieve your best possible grid position for the actual race. You can race a lap, then drive back to the pits and see how well the other drivers are performing (you can fast-forward time in the pits and watch the lap times), then go out again to improve yourself and secure your position. Once you're done, it's time for the main course.  Control and handling in F1 2002 are as easy or complicated as you want them to be. You can select from normal and simulation handling (the latter allows for locking brakes, more realistic handling and doesn't prevent the car from spinning), as well as speed assists and traction control. But once again, not all is well in GameCube land. For whatever reason -- and this one really, really stumps me -- none of the GameCube control setups let you use the analog triggers as analog gas and brakes. Like on the PS2 you have to use the right (C) stick as your accelerator and shift with the shoulder buttons if you want accurate control. F1 racing is as much about driving fast as it is about braking and slowly navigating tough hairpin turns. The GameCube controller has outstanding analog shoulder buttons that are perfect for recreating the feel of gas and brake pedals -- yet there is no option to utilize them correctly in this game. I find it hard to believe that the last six months were not enough time to port over the default control setup of the Xbox version, which uses the analog triggers just fine. And like in the previous versions, you can interrupt your race to replay the last few seconds of the race, but you can't see any replays after the race ends.   While the driver AI doesn't exactly reflect the real drivers' style and performance, the game does an amazing job at recreating the look and feel of a real F1 race. Everything that happens in real life can happen in the game. I've lost my front wing on the last lap of a thrilling Suzuka GP finale, drove ~on fumes~ and barely made it into the pits on the Circuit de Spa, and lost miserably because of an engine failure in Monza. The game plays by basic FIA rules (if you turn them on), so even though the impressive damage effects are tempting, you're best served playing it safe when overtaking opponents. But collisions do happen, and you'll quickly find out that the game's damage system isn't just cosmetic. Driving a car with busted suspension or a bent axis can quickly turn the game from a race to the finish to a cruise to the pits. Like in previous versions, the game immediately brings up the yellow flag when ~incidents~ occur, but the programmers should have added some lenience when it comes to stop-go penalties. If you're involved in a crash and you happen to skid past another driver as a result of the impact, you're fined with a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. The same doesn't seem to happen to AI drivers, though. On the upside, the pit stop mechanics are pretty cool. If you switch interactive pit stops on, driving into the pit lane requires you to go through some Shenmue-style button presses. The quicker and more accurately you perform them, the faster your pit crew works when changing tires or refueling.   As much as it irks me that this is last year's game in a new package, the truth remains that EA has done a remarkable job making what for the uninitiated comes across as boring on TV, an exciting event to experience. The package is rounded off by a variety of fun multiplayer modes ranging from consecutive ~party mode~ style challenges to four-player split-screen races.    Graphics Let's face it, real race tracks aren't all that exciting -- visually speaking -- but F1 2002's designers did a decent job recreating the tracks as accurately as possible. That's not an easy task, mind you. Unlike most racing games (NASCAR excepted), F1 games can't get away with having only six cars on screen at one time. The engine needs to be able to handle up to 22 cars at once on tracks that often contain long straights and plenty of trees. It's not surprising then that like so many F1 games, F1 2002 occasionally suffers in the framerate department. The GameCube version appears to run slightly smoother (30fps) than both the PS2 and the Xbox F1 2001 (and much smoother than the ~real~ F1 2002 for PS2). On the downside, everything in F1 2002 GameCube appears based on the PS2 original, not the graphically enhanced Xbox release. The Xbox version featured better textures, less jaggies, nicer lightning, a few added elements (like a helicopter in the air), but also a slightly blurrier look due to the anti-aliasing.  Luckily, the game packs a huge amount of both flashy and subtle effects, such as heat distortion, reflections, smoke, rain, and the like (but no sparks). The cars also properly interact with the track, leaving skid marks, slipping on wet rumble strips, or picking up dirt or grass particles if you happen to leave the track. The attention to detail really becomes apparent when you're playing with one of two cockpit modes. The first, which lets you see everything from the driver's eyes, shows you your hands on the steering wheel, complete with working indicators and gear shift animation. The second view mimics the onboard camera you'll see in TV broadcasts and sits right behind the driver. In this mode you can see slightly more of the track, as well as your driver's head bobbing left and right and him removing tear-off strips from his helmet whenever his view gets clouded. Nice. The game also features fully animated pit crews and crowds, but again no victory celebration sequences after winning a race or championship.  The GameCube version has a widescreen option for 16x9 TVs, but doesn't support progressive scan (480p).  Sound The audio in F1 2002 is a mixed bag, and the GameCube version doesn't sound as good as the PS2 and Xbox versions. While the gear and engine noises sound like the real deal, everything outside the car doesn't quite deliver. From far too quiet engine noises at the starting grid to the unconvincing Doppler effects from the other cars, the game could have sounded a lot better with the help of some authentic race samples for the background audio. If you've got a surround sound setup, switch your receiver to standard stereo mode. The game doesn't support DPL and tends to randomly knock your engine sounds out of phase to make your rear speakers sputter. You get used to it, but it's distracting and could have easily been fixed. Overall, the game sounds convincing enough and brings F1 to life in your living room with screeching engines, buzzing rumble strips and realistic pit commentary.  I cannot express how disappointed I was when I played my very first game of F1 2002 on GameCube. I was expecting a new game and instead found an old one. As a reviewer, I face an interesting dilemma. On one hand, I am absolutely furious that I was lured by the new box and name to buy an inferior version of last year's racer. On the other hand, I'm happy that GameCube owners get the superior F1 game -- as EA's F1 2002 on PS2 actually manages to be worse than F1 2001 in many respects. Outside of the updated teams, the only notable addition to F1 2002 for PS2 is the inclusion of Madden-style ~EA Sports Cards~. The PS2 version's challenge mode has been expanded, the car models look nicer, but the overall flow of the game isn't as nice and the graphics chop up much more than the previous version. To make things worse, EA added a ~draft meter~ complete with silly sound effect whenever you're slipstreaming behind a car... Folks, this isn't NASCAR. Give me a subtle speed boost, but don't elevate a minor factor in F1 racing to be the sole governing strategy. That said, it's very disappointing that absolutely none of the new features in F1 2002 or even in the Xbox version of 2001 were brought over to GameCube. What we're left with is a good racing game that's starting to look and feel dated. Let's quickly recap: F1 2002 for GameCube is F1 2001 with worse audio, less narration, updated teams and rosters, a slightly better framerate, no analog pedal control via the triggers, and a shiny, brand new box. I'd still recommend it over F1 2002 for PS2 (unless you like to hear ~woosh woosh woosh~ whenever you're tailgating), but if you want the best version, pick up last year's Xbox game instead. GameCube-only owners who haven't played F1 2001 and are looking for a competent racing game, definitely take a look.", "date": "Jul 1, 2002"}
