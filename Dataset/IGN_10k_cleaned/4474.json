David Crane, Pitfall's creator, is arguably the one responsible for the modern day platformer. His spunky hero and obstacle jumping framework is the same formula that today's most beloved platform franchises are based on. Now, Activision has brought Harry out of retirement with the help of developer Edge of Reality.  While he was recuperating from his original adventure, Harry has been transformed into a quip spouting 3D hero akin to modern platformer heroes. Now you'll actually be able to make out his expressive features, he's able to roam freely around 3D environments, and there are slight puzzle solving problems for him to contend with. However, has this makeover justified Harry's leave from the retirement home? Read on.  The Facts Pitfall realized in 3D Traverse throughout four main areas broken up into 50 levels Solve item specific puzzles with torches, ice picks and rafts Classic platforming action like vine swinging, pit avoidance, log jumping, and crocodile hopping Full hand control Dolby Digital  Havok Physics Engine Gameplay Pitfall Harry's swarthy good looks, winning way with women, and comic disposition land him in more trouble than he knows how to handle. While en route to the Peruvian Jungle, Harry's plane crashes in a thunderstorm. Waking up on the jungle floor, Harry has to meet up with his fellow explorers, rescue the girl, and stop his rival Jonathan St. Claire from snatching up all the treasure.    Pitfall: The Lost Expedition takes a lot of direction from such properties as Indiana Jones. There are several instances throughout Pitfall that directly reference Dr. Jones' adventures. You'll run from rolling boulders, need to figure out which floor stones are safe to stand on (Last Crusade), or have to make your way across a rickety old bridge. Harry is even transformed into a monkey, causing him to remark, ~This never happens to that Jones guy.~   Humor is Pitfall's greatest strength. Edge of Reality had a lot of fun with the license. Everything from Harry's interaction with the environment to the numerous cut scenes scattered throughout the Expedition reek of goofiness. If Harry winds up in crocodile jaws, he can pry them open and catapult to the last bit of dry land he touched. Falling into one of the gaping pits doesn't spell doom -- instead the pit closes, takes a few crunchy bites, and then spits Harry out. Natives use camouflage netting to hide their village. Where else would you find a hero running around collecting butterflies for a native Princess? Harry also gets transformed into various animals like a monkey, penguin, and scorpion and then has to attack his own body to regain possession. Cut scenes depict Harry's trouble with ladies, natives with social problems (a gate keeper has a killing fetish), encounters with a magical Jaguar, and meetings with St. Claire. While the humor adds a certain charm to Pitfall, it wanes after a few hours. As the game progresses, the humor begins to feel forced -- like its trying too hard to be funny instead of being funny.      The only other noteworthy element is Harry's fully controllable appendage. The right analog stick is used to raise or move Harry's right arm from side to side in a rather funny looking slapping motion (unfortunately you can't actually slap enemies). It seems gimmicky at first, but it's a surprisingly effective gameplay mechanic. Instead of running up to an idol (Pitfall's currency) and hitting the X button to pick it up, you simply move Harry's arm in a swiping motion and he'll snag the idol and stuff it in his knapsack. Levers need switching? Grab onto the lever with your arm and swing the right analog stick in the proper direction to activate it.   Your arm has a slew of other uses. As Harry adventures through the jungle, he'll pick up numerous items to help him get past obstacles. All of these are stored in Harry's knapsack and can be assigned to the directional pad for quick access. Hold a canteen underwater to fill it and raise it to Harry's mouth to replenish health. A gasmask has to be held to Harry's face to get past poisonous plants. If he uses an inflatable raft, the two control sticks are used to paddle him across bodies of water. Both arms are also used when Harry climbs ice walls with ice axes. If a torch is equipped, Harry can wave it around to light bats on fire or investigate dark places. The arm mechanic makes Pitfall a bit more interactive then your standard platformer. As goofy as the interface seems when you initially use it, the arm control adds a surprising amount of depth to the typical button pressing routine -- giving you a lot more control over your hero.   Once you strip Pitfall of its ~arm control~ and sporadic doses of humor, you're left with a very generic platformer. Yes, The Lost Expedition stays true in many respects to the original Pitfall. You'll have to dodge logs rolling down a hill, avoid pits, swing on vines, jump on crocodiles, swim from piranhas, escape babysitting monkeys, and almost any other platforming task that can occur in a jungle. There are booby traps that need avoiding, angry natives to vanquish, and even the occasional out of body experience. But, it's hard to find something that hasn't been done before. This wouldn't be bad if Pitfall was flawless in its execution, but there's plenty wrong with the overall game design.    The first complaint is that Harry's adventure is far too forgiving. The Expedition unfolds over a rather large area that wanders from the jungle and caverns to snowy mountain peaks. Within each area, Harry can view a map that tells him how to get from one stage to the next and outlines all the different obstacles he'll encounter in a given region. If one area is blocked off by a wall that can only be passed with TNT or a wall of ice that needs ice axes to bypass, it'll be marked on the map so that Harry can return at his leisure. While there is a good amount of backtracking, the routes aren't complex enough to warrant telling you where to go -- it pales in comparison to the navigation required for Metroid.   If Harry visits one of the local Shamans, he can purchase move upgrades, extra health, a larger canteen, etc. While upgrades are always welcomed, most gamers won't have a problem getting through the adventure with Harry's stock items. If Harry falls off a ledge, he reappears right where he fell. If he actually dies, you restart at the beginning of the stage (which is never far away). You're never set back by careless jumping, which removes any of the typical platforming pressures.  With all this help, one would imagine Harry's adventure would be a fairly easy one to complete. It's far from hard, but your progression is often hindered for some of the stupidest reasons. Although Harry controls very well -- he has the right weight and speed -- his jumps are almost always off. It's hard to tell whether it's a trick of the camera or a fault of the physics system, but it's quite easy to repeatedly miss the same jump (especially when trying to reach vines). It's as if at a certain distance he hits an invisible wall that makes him plummet downwards instead of following the traditional arc. These continual near misses are enough to make one throw his or her controller in disgust, but there's more.     There are certain instances where Harry has to use a sling to hit switches or other items like icicles or vines to progress through the game. Early on, you have to knock a dorky scientist out of a tree. It seems as simple as shooting the vines that suspend him in the air, but it'll take numerous tries before you hit the specific spot that'll trigger the drop.   Harry has a wide arsenal of damage inflicting moves. He can perform a sweep kick to knock enemies on the ground,  a rising strike that can hit flying enemies and acts as a super jump, a break dancing move that can knock down numerous critters at once, and a simple punch. While you earn these powerful moves throughout the expedition, you never actually need them because you can always kill creatures using simple attacks (although the latter ones will kill them faster). However, no matter how powerful Harry is, he's always at a disadvantage.   All enemies have some form of projectile attack. No matter how much crazy running or jumping you do, enemies can always hit you. You can't block. If an enemy is about to throw something at you, you might take evasive action by rolling on the ground or jumping. You'll still get injured. It's frustrating. If you don't kill enemies quickly, you're dead. It's even more of a problem when you're trying to climb up platforms because they will knock you down as soon as you pull yourself onto a ledge. It's an instance where difficulty is artificially boosted by cheap A.I. tactics.  What's sad is that these clusters of enemies will give you more trouble then the few bouts you have with St. Claire. These ~boss~ battles resort to basic pattern fighting -- like kill all the minions before you're able to hit St. Claire. It emphasizes the overall lack of challenge -- especially since the greatest trials are due to unintentional hindrances.   Pitfall uses the much touted Havoc Physics Engine, but it results in some rather sketchy applications of physics. Harry runs into a lot of the aforementioned ~invisible wall~ physics, which prevent him from completing jumps he should make. When you swing back and forth on the vines, the excess vine will start swinging around in a circle like a lasso. It's completely unnatural.  There's also a slight problem with the collision detection -- there isn't any. The vines freely swing through Harry's body. He can sink through ledges and walk through plants. At one point, Harry has to walk on a narrow beam to pass the natives' initiation rites. This is hardly a balancing act because there is a Harry-width of invisible ground on either side of the beam. There are also instances where Harry can fall off a moving conveyer belt and grab at an invisible ledge to pull himself back up. Harry gets caught in corners between ledges or on the edge of complex geometrical objects -- he'll only free himself by eventually falling to his doom or grabbing another invisible ledge.   Pitfall's gameplay is generic to the extreme. The only original element is the ~arm control,~ but that's hardly enough to make the The Lost Expedition a worthy gameplay experience. It's an odd combination of being far too easy and way too frustrating. Most will have no problem blasting through Pitfall in eight to ten hours.   Graphics Pitfall isn't a pretty game. Even though the jungles are heavily populated with plant life and critters (like monkeys, porcupines, crocodiles, and natives), the environments always feel strangely dead. Pitfall is overridden with bland textures. The water and fire effects are downright awful. At least Harry's animation is good, whether it's his backpack bobbing on his back or the multiple applications of his arm.   The collision detection gives The Lost Expedition a sloppy presentation, which extends into the game engine rendered cut scenes. Characters' arms and legs pass through each other with ease. The cut scenes themselves show the same level of detail as the rest of the game, except the lack of texture work is more prominent.  Pitfall also has a few frame rate stutters, but most of the game's earlier problems have been locked down.   Sound You'll be able to hear the cacophony of screaming monkeys or shouting tribesmen flock around your head. Hissing scorpions are enough to give you shivers. There are plenty of sounds to hear, whether they're Harry's feet slipping on ice or pounding on wooden planks. The score isn't too noticeable and is often overpowered by the sound effects in gameplay. The music isn't bad, and is actually fitting to the adventuresome property, but there isn't enough variation. It sounds almost like one track is looped throughout the Expedition. Voice acting is decent and fits the characters. Occasionally the delivery is off a bit, ruining a good punch line. Pitfall's sound isn't the best, but it's not bad. I really hoped Pitfall would be a decent game. It had potential and a fair share of charm, but it completely fell apart in the execution. It's just frustrating. There are tons of unnecessary and annoying gameplay mechanics. The enemy lock on troubled me to no end. Everyone who picked up the game had issues with making relatively easy jumps. I appreciate small touches like fighting my way out of crocodile jaws or being eaten by man-eating pits, but it doesn't make Pitfall fun.  As much as I like the arm control, Pitfall still feels generic. There's never an instance where you're taken off guard by some new gameplay mechanic or a clever use of tried and true platforming staples. Sadly, it's easier to have fun with the original Pitfall that can be unlocked in The Lost Expedition than it is traipsing through this 3D jungle. The technical aspects really hindered my enjoyment as well. There's nothing as frustrating as getting stuck in midair and being unable to free yourself. It felt like I in some way broke the game every time I picked it up.Pitfall is easy, frustrating, and over far too quickly. If you're looking for a clever platformer, try Tak and the Power of Juju. Pitfall has far too many problems, shortcomings, and lack of fun to warrant more than a rental.", "date": "Feb 19, 2004"}
