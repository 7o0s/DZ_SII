Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/30/tamagotchi-party-on-review", "text": "Ever since Nintendo showed off Wii Sports back at E3 of last year, the ~Revolution~ was changed forever.  Sure we'll continue to get games like Metroid Prime 3 and The Legend of Zelda, but the system is being bombarded with tons of mini-games, and there seems to be no end in sight.  Some of the games - Rayman and Monkey Ball come to mind - are entirely worthy of your collection, but for every compilation that entertains, there seem to be a handful of some that don't.  In case you were wondering, Tamagotchi: Party On! is one that doesn't - though we're entirely convinced the game is completely insane, and it's pretty entertaining on that level.   Tamagotchi: Party On! is, at nearly every facet of its being, a Mario Party clone.  Players take control of a chibi Tamagotchi character during an all-important election time, and throw their hats in the ring as Tamagotchi President; what an honor!  In order to get it though, you'll need to compete against three other candidates (human or AI controlled) who also seek the throne, unleashing an epic struggle of good and evil the likes of which nobody has ever seen.  In order to win the candidacy, you'll need to campaign, thus launching each character in a party-based board game which combines the Mario Party design with Life and Sorry, as you'll need the luck of the dice roll in hopes of achieving the most money (called Gotchi), the highest amount of popularity points - acquired by landing on event spaces - and winning mini-game challenges to impress the world one turn at a time.  Rather than seeking a star like in Mario Party, your goal is a coveted crown that rests across the town-spaces, but it's the same roll-based race to the space.   The game may not be amazing, but this guy rocks.  Where Tamagotchi: Party On! comes up short though, it does in a huge, huge way.  For starters, every election campaign must have four players, so if you're on your own you'll be watching three computer candidates take full-length turns throughout the entire adventure.  To make matters worse, all of the mini-games in Tamagotchi: Party On! are single player, so when it isn't your turn you might as well be grabbing a soda or walking the dog, as it can take eight to ten minutes for a circuit to complete amongst the four players.  Even with four human players (something we've actually bribed and pleaded our way into doing), there's no direct competition between candidates, as each player rolls the dice, does a mini-game when applicable - which is once out of every three or four rolls - and is rewarded based on their performance.  Unlike Mario Party or previous mini-game titles, there's no common time when a mini-game is forced onto the players, so if you're unlucky in your rolls and constantly get event spaces you may only do a mini-game once every 20 minutes to a half hour.  Yikes.   But hey, at least the mini-games are well worth the wait, right?  Not exactly.  Tamagotchi mini-games are split amongst two different categories; Mini-game Spaces, and Gotchi Game Spaces.  Based on which space you land on, a different style of game is played.  For the actual mini-game spaces, you'll load up a short motion-based activity such as hand-shaking or serving ice scream, each designed with Wii waggle in mind.  With the gotchi games, however, a tiny Tamagotchi game unit (similar to the retail virtual pet ~Tamagotchi~ units) will bounce onto the screen, prompting up a simple three-button mini-game.  Each of these makes use only of the d-pad (using left, up, and right for the three buttons), and have no motion whatsoever.  Also, each of these games are amazingly simple, including things like rock/paper/scissors.  No multiplayer, no motion, and an extremely basic mini-game that's actually possible on the smaller, cheaper retail Tamagotchi units.   Single player, no motion, and a tiny screen.  Really?  There's more actual depth to the board game itself, as you'll move across the table in hopes of gaining cash to upgrade your candidate's headquarters and actually move from city to city all in the span of one game - a progression not found in Mario Party, for instance - but it's all the same mundane turn play-outs over and over.  Your character slides into view, you grab the Wii-mote, and smash it down on a small catapult that launches a die into the air.  The number you get is the number of spaces you move, and in turn the icon you land on.  Events are fully-scripted, showing a small clip art video within another on-screen Tamagotchi unit, and mini-games - as we mentioned - aren't too rewarding either.     What it comes down to, then, is a hope that you'll hit a six every turn, bringing you one step closer to another election win.  Sure, you can buy new accessories to up your popularity should you land on a shop space, or actually hoof it back to your headquarters one turn at a time to expand on the size of your candidate's home base, but when there's such a small amount of strategy and mini-game involvement turn after turn there'll be no fight left in you after a few rounds of play.     And though Tamagotchi's gameplay is about as boring as a trip to Grandma's house without a Game Boy, there's certainly something to be said about the entirely psychotic visual style of the game.  The whole amass of visuals are over-saturated and full of smiling Tamagotchi critters circa the ~It's a Small Word~ ride, and all along the way players are bombarded with high-pitched Japanese-like voices and rotating, spastic clip art.  It may not deliver an entertaining gameplay experience, but the visuals in Tamagotchi: Party On! are equivalent to getting beaten half to death by a baseball bat made of rock candy, and the overly-spastic attitude certainly adds some style to the game.  It's sweet, but so utterly painful at the same time.  Putting the style and pure comedic value aside, Tamagotchi: Party On! adds nothing to the Wii library, and just isnt worth even a budget price tag.  The mini-games are shallow and one-player only, each turn drags on far too long, and the sheer lack of any actual party elements keeps it from attaining even the basic  yet still redundant  entertainment found in the long-lived Mario Party series.  If youre looking for a party title on Wii, youll want to look to something like Rayman, Monkey Ball, Wario Ware, or even Mario Party over Tamagotchi, as the game lacks any real lasting appeal to make it worth not only the cash, but also the time it takes to complete a game.  Wii is a party system, and there are/will be plenty of games to make great use of its causal nature.  No matter how young, desperate, or niche you are, Tamagotchi: Party On! is a poor, poor choice.  You get more Tamagotchi for your buck by buying the LCD virtual pet, as it has infinitely more appeal, depth, and value as well.", "date": "May 30, 2007"}
