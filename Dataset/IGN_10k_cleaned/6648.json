Many of the recent shooter and strategy offerings have certainly managed to offer a new twist on the overly familiar setting. WWII Tank Commander is unique in that it takes the thrilling concept of leading a tank during World War II and completely removes anything that might actually make the game exciting or interesting.  The game's not intended to be a simulation -- it's just an arcade game that happens to feature a tank. The action here is about on par with the tank missions from Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, but without the cinematic presentation or visual polish. The basic move-shoot concept certainly makes the game approachable enough for even the most inexperienced gamer but it's far too simplistic to satisfy gamers who expect the little extras -- things like AI, physics, excitement, etc.   In brief, the game offers players the chance to make their way through ten different missions as the Allies make their way from Normandy to Bastogne. In every mission the player will be tasked with hunting down German soldiers and tanks. In some cases you'll be racing across open country and taking down pockets of enemies as you find them. In other cases, you'll be negotiating bombed-out cities, searching for ambushes around every corner. No matter what the ostensible objective of a mission is, it basically boils down to shooting the crap out of everything that you come across.  While watching the tanks sway and rock as they fire is a nice little touch, that's really the extent of the game's attempt to model any sort of realism. It's particularly disappointing because the lack of realism means that the game completely fails to convey the basic coolness of tanks. Small arms fire from infantry damages your tank, for one thing. While it might make for a more dangerous mission environment, having to worry about enemy machine guns completely defeats the purpose of putting the player in a tank to begin with. Ditto for the complete lack of variable armor facings. You can damage a tank just as easily from the front as you can from the rear and it only takes three hits to knock out any enemy tank in the game. Add in the fact that your tank can't even drive over a simple wooden fence.  This is a game about tanks?  The missions are so tightly scripted that they'd benefit from a heaping teaspoon of Metamucil. Every encounter plays out exactly the same no matter how many times you play the mission. Enemies are completely static as well and have no AI whatsoever; even the infantry will just stand there in the road, firing wildly at you until you take them out. Knowing just where every enemy is in each mission certainly makes it easier to get through the tougher missions but it completely kills any sense of excitement that the game's concept deserves. The best the developers can hope for is to hide the enemies behind tall grass or on the far side of a building. That's as challenging as the game gets.  Friendly tanks are much more mobile but even they follow predictable paths based on obvious triggers. Worst of all, the friendly tanks in some missions are completely invulnerable. No matter how often they're shot, they just won't die. Players can basically sit out while their friendly tank plows through enemy after enemy. Adding to the confusion, the very next mission is likely to feature a friendly tank that's fated to die at a particular spot, no matter how much you try to save them.  Your own tank can absorb numerous hits before death is even a consideration. A handy health bar lets you see just how close you're getting to cashing in. Fortunately, almost every enemy tank you destroy will drop a handy health pack. Just roll over it and you're back in business.  While it makes it relatively easy to make your way through most missions, you'll still find yourself exploding every once in a while. In an attempt to extend the playability of the title, the developers have opted to do away with save games or checkpoints in their missions. Once you die, you have to go all the way back to the beginning and run the mission over again. Nothing will have changed since the last time you ran through though, so you should have a pretty good idea of where you screwed up.  WWII Tank Commander looks okay for a budget game. The gritty quality of the graphics works well for the setting and I kind of like the colorful palette. It's no Psychonauts, but it definitely makes the game stand out a bit from the rest of the World War II games that are on the market. Still, the muddy textures and rough models aren't too impressive and the outrageous lens flare effect is more distracting than anything.  Once you've wrapped up the ten missions, there's nothing else for you to do in WWII Tank Commander. Well, nothing except start digging around for the receipt.Gamers who are looking for a simple, arcade-oriented tank game will enjoy the few hours they spend with WWII Tank Commander. Those sim and shooter fans who prefer a little more substance in their games will likely be aggravated by the one-dimensional approach. I could almost forgive the game's straightforward control style if it weren't for the incredibly predictable missions and the total lack of realism. You can't expect too much for twenty bucks and that's exactly what you get with WWII Tank Commander.", "date": "Feb 21, 2006"}
