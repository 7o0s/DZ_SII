{"name": "Final Fight", "name_review": "Final Fight Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/07/final-fight-review", "text": "Initially planned to be the sequel to the wildly successful Street Fighter, there was surely nothing ~final~ about Final Fight, as it would be ported from arcades, released across numerous platforms, and spawn further sequels and spin-offs. Hitting American Super Nintendos in November 1991, Final Fight was a fairly loyal port from its arcade brethren. Despite some minor issues (censoring Katana's original name of ~Sodom~, the removal of the playable character Guy, or covering Poison's partially exposed boobs) the game held up under scrutiny. One glaring fault, however, was the puzzling (and immensely frustrating) castrating of the game's ridiculously fun two-Player mode.   For those unfamiliar with the game, Haggar -- a very large brute -- refuses to aid Mad Gear in his bid for dominance over the city streets. The evil Mad Gear kidnaps Haggar's daughter, Jessica, and holds her hostage. Haggar hops on the phone, calls up Jessica's boyfriend -- an accomplished fighter -- Cody, and informs him of the dire situation. The two hit the streets with the vengeance of a father's rage and the annoyance of a boyfriend having lost his scrabble partner. The two kick ass and take names at an alarming rate.           Cody is a well-balanced fighter, dealing respectable damage to enemies while remaining quite agile. Haggar is slower but lands more punishing blows. Beginners may find Cody easier to use at first. Both characters posses a wide variety of debilitating punches, kicks, slams, and throws. Simply pressing X will cause the character to punch, B is jump, and while in the air, press X to deal a kick. Health can be restored along the way by uncovering roast hams and chickens hidden in barrels and crates (fine dining at its best).    Even after a decade and a half the gameplay holds up quite well. Cans of whoop-ass are unleashed at every possible turn, as the side-scrolling beat-em-up progresses through its flaky story. Despite the overall story not being anything spectacular, the character names and models are quite entertaining. You'll take on charming fellows such as El Gado, Holly Wood, and even Andore -- the Japanese pronunciation of Andre -- who is modeled after the legendary Frenchman and wrestler Andre the Giant. Don't be fooled by his calm exterior (a bright pink glitter tank top) either, he has no reservations about grabbing Cody or Haggar and piledriving them into the ground. And I mean that, he actually piledrives him like Zangief in Street Fighter II (oh, and Haggar punches like Blanka as is the flame animation for someone set ablaze). I guess you can't harp on Capcom for recycling impressive animations - it may even have been deliberate, as the game feels a lot like Street Fighter in terms of mechanics and AI (which isn't a bad thing).     While the graphics are true to the arcade version, the sound most certainly is not. Due to an inferior audio chip in the Super Nintendo (when compared to the arcade rendition), the effects cut in and out all the time. While it's not a detractor from the gameplay, it's still a noticeable nuisance.    Far worse than the sound issues is the absence of the original 2-Player cooperative mode that was just so much FUN in the arcade. Even though the game can hold its own with the single-player campaign, not being able to control Hagger and Cody with a buddy really hurts.The game is just as much fun to play today as it was 15 years ago. It really feels like a side-scrolling Street Fighter II, from the animations and attacks, to the responsive and simple controls.
