It's a point and click adventure of an unusual mold.  You are a tourist who visits Capri hoping for a relaxing weekend.  Instead, you are thrust into what can best be described as an alternate universe.  What makes it truly bizarre is the style of game itself - as it is essentially a slideshow of photographs that you can interact with.   From the moment you start playing the game, you will be thoroughly confused.  This appears to be intentional, but at times can be really frustrating.  You'll ask yourself, why am I collecting these strange plants?  Why am I putting together ingredients for a meal?  What is the point of all this?  Since answers are far and few between, this may be incredibly maddening for a lot of people.  However, if you view the game as it was intended, to show off the incredibly beautiful island of Capri, it succeeds amazingly at that goal.   There are some puzzles - none of which are difficult to solve and most which just add more information about the island of Capri to your knowledge base.  There will be times where you can take an item and put it in your inventory or manipulate the environment with an item from your inventory.  These instances are very clear when they are necessary, so no worrying about whether or not there is some random hotspot on the screen.  The only thing about the interaction that might be annoying is the sheer number of locales that you can visit - as the game allows you to wander randomly throughout the island and you can spend a goodly amount of time doing just that and trying to figure out its purpose.   Travel can be done in two ways.  You can wander around Capri or you can jump around the major sections then wander around.  A large arrow indicates if you are allowed to proceed in a certain direction and there will often be multiple ways to go.  Turning around and backing up out of a scene are options available by clicking on an icon.  The entire game is mouse based; you'll never need your keyboard.  Other icons available include a globe that opens up a map to show you where you are, a bag which opens your inventory and a notepad to review all the conversations you've partaken in.  The map is difficult to read, although by the end of the game you'll know it like you know the back of your hand - a really great thing for anyone who wants to vacation in Capri.   This guy is awesome.  The graphics are your basic high quality photograph.  Over 4000 photographs make up the available screens in this game - so you can imagine it is quite a large game world.  There are no animations and the cutscenes involve listening to people talk while looking at a still picture of them.  The voice acting is authentic, but very difficult to decipher, which is why the notepad is so critical to the game.  The actors will often give you clues to your tasks or tell you where something is, if you can understand them.  There is some good music and I noticed it often appears when you are on the right track, so audio clues might be a part of the game (although I'm not 100% sure on this one).  There are plenty of sound effects too, from the sound of running water when near a spout to the ambient sounds of birds chirping away in their cage.  A Quiet Weekend in Capri definitely tries new things.  Putting a grand adventure story into these still photographs is a difficult thing to pull off and they do as well as one can possibly do.  It has pretty good sounds and a storyline that can only be described as different - in that it keeps you in the dark about just about everything throughout the game.  If you enjoy vacation slides or have always wanted to learn a lot about Capri or ever plan on a trip there yourself, this game is worth picking up for its educational value.  A Quiet Weekend in Capri can also be played in full Italian, a plus for anyone who knows the language or wants to learn.  I don't really think this is a game for hardcore gamers though - most will be very disappointed.", "date": "Mar 4, 2004"}
