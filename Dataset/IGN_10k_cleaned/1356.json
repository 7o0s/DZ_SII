The title, based on the movie of the same name, followed the exploits of super-spy James Bond as he plotted to save the world from terrorists. And thanks to clever, innovative design and a remarkable multiplayer mode, it proved that consoles could do the then PC friendly genre justice too. For more than a year Nintendo 64 owners cried for a Bond sequel all the while expecting that Rare would be the software house to create it. After all, GoldenEye's end credits did promise: ~James Bond Will Return.~ But not from Rare. The British developer instead announced that it had passed on the chance to do the follow-up so that it could pursue its original work, which as we all know turned out to be the great Perfect Dark.  Yet, Nintendo's 64-bit console would see the return of James Bond still, and from another English developer at that: Eurocom Entertainment. The up and coming company had quietly been working on a 3D engine catered specifically to Nintendo's hardware and with a little help from giant publisher Electronic Arts, the videogame version of The World is Not Enough was born. Excellent news too -- it turns out Rare's not the only developer that can make a highly enjoyable Bond shooter. The Facts32MBs (256 megabit) cartridge -- the same size as Perfect Dark. 3D first-person shooter developed by Eurocom Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts Play as the one and only James Bond Action-packed single and four-player multiplayer modes that maintain a constant, high framerate for fast, fluid gameplay 14 single-player missions with different levels of difficulty More than 40 unique Bond weapons and innovative gadgets to acquire and utilize 4MB Expansion Pak support provides enhanced graphics and visual effects 14 multiplayer arenas and levels, many of which are based on movie scenes and locales Unlock tons of character skins for use in the multiplayer mode Enemy bots in multiplayer mode Authentic sounds and dialogue folded in throughout the game that adds to overall seamless and exciting gameplay Gameplay The World is Not Enough, like GoldenEye 007, stays true to the movie license of the same name. It's visibly evident from the moment the game boots up that developer Eurocom has gone to great lengths to follow the storyline closely. The shooter begins as Bond makes his way through the Banque Suisse de L-Industrie in Bilbao, Spain on a mission to meet up with the banker Lachaise, a character also featured in the film, and a suspicious one at that. The overall adventure kicks into full force from this starting point, following all of the major moments from the movie including, but not limited to 007's skiing battle, sneaking around at night in Davidov's security office, the helicopters with saw blades scene, and the underwater submarine showdown. As you can see by clicking right here, Eurocom has really done an amazing job recreating the cinema experience for the Nintendo 64 owner, perhaps more so than any other movie-to-game license to date.  Eurocom's shooter does not stop at presentation though. The title plays just as Bond fans hoped it would; it's fast, it's packed full of mission objectives, and it's overflowing with impressive spy gadgetry, all brought together under a slick 3D engine. Is it a blatant copy of GoldenEye in many respects? Yes. Does it play a whole heck of a lot like Rare's first-person shooter? In many ways, the answer is again yes. Is that really a bad thing though? Absolutely not. GoldenEye rocked, and developer Eurocom has done its best to recreate that original design, and then add to it with a few innovations of its own.  The World is Not Enough features 14 single-player missions that employ a variety of different first-person shooter gameplay styles. In one level Bond is required to chase a criminal across a maze-like city while fighting off enemy thugs and avoiding civilian casualties. In another our hero finds himself swimming through an underwater submarine, advancing not only forward and backward, but up and down to as he descends deeper into the sunken structure's belly. And in another mission still Bond must take out violent terrorists in an underground subway system. Each scenario is not only different in design, but in overall gameplay mechanics too. For example, swimming through a sunken submarine requires a bit of strategy, as Bond will have to find well-hidden air pockets in the ship just so that he can breathe and stay alive. On the other hand, taking out enemy trash in the subway system level really only requires 007 to point, aim and shoot, disposing of thug after thug as he makes his way through the mission.   The majority of the 14 levels in the game are put together superbly with lots of variation, great enemy placement and something new to do at every corner, be it shoot the bad guys or complete one of the mission objectives. The end experience is one that, especially in 00 Agent mode, is so much fun to play and so enjoyable that you'll have a hard time putting the controller down, and it's for this reason that we primarily recommend the game.   In fact, only one stage, actually, Cold Reception, gets just that from us, not because it's particular poor, but because it doesn't quite deliver on the same level as the rest of the single-player missions. In it, Bond must ski down a huge mountain overflowing with terrorists who are all too happy to shoot at him from every direction (and even in parachuting snowmobiles from above). The concept is great, but unfortunately Eurocom decided to unfold the action on-rails so that complete freedom of movement is not an option. The end result, more constrictive, is less satisfying than the rest of the game.   All of the single-player stages feature mission objectives which, depending on the degree of difficulty played (Agent, Secret Agent or 00 Agent), vary in quantity and length. Having tested all of the different modes, we can honestly recommend 00 Agent as the only way to play; it's just got so many more enemies and more clever, hard to execute mission objectives that it's totally worth the added effort -- and you will be satisfied with it. With mission objectives in mind, another play style is a necessity -- stealth mode. Like GoldenEye, The World is Not Enough sports dozens of areas that require more than just a quick trigger finger to properly best. Bond will need to use all of his sneaky gadgets and he's got a whole lot of them at his disposable. The list includes all of the following goodies: Flash bang gun, Secret detonator, Claymore, Pen grenade, camera, phone tap, safe cracker, keypad decrypter, fingerprint scanner, bomb disposal kit, data scrambler, covert modem and swipe card, to name just a few. These in addition to night-vision goggles, x-ray vision goggles and a wristwatch that features everything from stun darts to a grappling hook for high to reach areas. The gadgetry isn't just in the game for fluff, it's extremely useful; in some areas 007 will literally have to sneak through the dark with his night-vision goggles, crouch around corners, sniper-in on enemies and silently take them down. He'll then have to shoot out a locked gate with his silencer, use his swipe card to gain access to the next area, disable the enemy's camera systems with the data scrambler, move into the guarded room, stun the bad guys with his dart watch, and use his safe-cracker to unlock a chest so that he can photo documents inside. Sound awesome? That's because it is.  Perhaps our biggest gripe in the single-player mode is the enemy artificial intelligence -- not nearly as well demonstrated as in Rare's Perfect Dark, for example, a title that The World is Not Enough is bound to be compared to. The bad guys in Eurocom's shooter just aren't exceptionally smart -- and that's not to say that they are stupid either. Certain programmed attributes make for welcomed in-game additions, like, for instance, when Bond sneaks up behind a guard with his gun drawn, the enemy will then turn around and put his hands up. Or when Bond opens a door guards close by will yell, ~Who's there?~ and proceed to examine the area. But sometimes enemy groups fail to react in a lifelike manner; when one guard is shot, the others will continue with their business as if nothing has happened. And worst of all, these poor saps make almost no effort to move out of the way of oncoming bullets. Is it as terrible as some other critics have suggested? We don't believe so. In fact, if one raises the difficulty level to 00 Agent, there's hardly any time to worry about the game's decidedly normal AI between blasting enemies and accomplishing mission objectives. With that said, Perfect Dark enemy intelligence this game does not deliver. Multiplayer Mode The only other area in which we feel that The World is Not Enough fails to measure up against Rare's efforts is the multiplayer mode, and again that doesn't make it bad, just not great. A commendable effort on Eurocom's part to be sure, the game features 14 multiplayer levels based mostly on the single-player ones. Right off the bat we notice that they are extremely fast moving areas -- a much better sense of fluidity and framerate than in Perfect Dark, for example. The multiplayer modes are pretty standard, with lots of selectable weapons to choose from, and different gameplay modes to boot including everything from standard Deathmatch to Team Play and Capture the Flag, Capture the Briefcase, King of the Hill, Team King of the Hill, Uplink and Last Agent Standing. There are also different weapon modes, from Rapid Fire guns to Covert ones, as well as Close Combat, Sniper Combat, and so on.  Certainly the number of options Rare's shooter has is its major strength here, and admittedly The World is Not Enough simply doesn't touch it in that respect. The title features all sorts of customizable Bond character skins -- everything from 007 himself to the evil Renard or, if you prefer, Christmas Jones. But all of the player attributes, rankings, and different styles are pretty well naked in comparison to Rare's shooter.   In terms of multiplayer action, it's super fast, incredibly smooth, beautiful, and still a little on the stale side. Bots, up to three in all, are relatively stupid and can be killed rather easily, unless they take down your character with a quick, cheesy shot to the head, which sometimes happens. Perfect Dark really demonstrated how tough AI opponents can be in a console game and Eurocom's title definitely falls short there. With everything said, though, not a bad multiplayer experience at all. In fact, with a few friends it can be an enjoyable one.  Graphics Beautiful. Detailed. Fast. Smooth. These four words sum up the visual experience that is The World is Not Enough N64. Eurocom has really put a lot of time and effort into a super-polished 3D engine that enables high quality visuals with a respectable framerate -- a fluidity better than Rare's Perfect Dark or GoldenEye. Texture design and character animation is generally very high, and equally fast. When Bond takes out an enemy with a shotgun blast, they are blown back to the ground immediately and the animation looks dead-on, whereas if he shoots them in the foot with a standard pistol they grab at their legs in pain. An excellent particle effects system works to highlight detailed explosions, blasts, fires, smoke, and the like, usually with no hit on the framerate whatsoever. Gun reloading animations are varied and realistic; you can see the watch on Bond's hands as he adds in new shotgun shells, or the rocket barrel on the ground when he's out of ammo for that particular weapon.   Even more amazing, though, are the 3D environments themselves. Eurocom's slick 3D engine allows for excellent draw distance without fog, so we can see vast areas including huge city streets with civilians running around, rooftop locales, industrial warehouses, and more. These stages are often filled with taxing 3D objects like floating animated helicopters with saw blades (that actually do damage the surrounding environment!) or enemies with mounted weaponry and missile launchers. Sometimes all of the madness can be seen on-screen at once and again with a respectable fluidity, which is very important for a game of this type. The cinematic cut-scenes are well placed and come off brilliantly, but unfortunately there is a loading screen between them that is rather annoying. But beyond all else -- quite frankly, once you've experienced the visual treats that are the game's night-vision and x-ray vision goggles, there's simply no going back to any of the competition's equals.   Oddly, The World is Not Enough does feature massive dithering for reasons unknown. The effect leaves some areas, particularly dark ones, looking a little grainy, but it's actually not a bad style, it's just a different one than what most Nintendo 64 owners are used to. All in all, though, an extremely good looking game, and don't believe any review that says otherwise. Sound Okay, first things first: what happened to Monty Norman's James Bond Theme? The classic Bond title music we all know and love is absent from the game and sorely missed. But with that issue aside, The World is Not Enough sounds spectacular. Crisp, clear effects, from explosions to all of the different firing noises the guns make, and top voice acting from quality actors, including the one and only John Cleese, who plays R in the film. Really a top notch job on Eurocom's part here.  The World is Not Enough is an excellent 3D shooter for Nintendo 64 and an amazing follow-up to Rare's GoldenEye. Whether or not its ultimately better than Perfect Dark is a question that's open for debate, as different gamers obviously want different things out of their shooter. However, if it's an incredible single-player mode packed full of spy gadgetry, stealthy missions, clever mission objectives and outstanding graphics that you're after, you can't do better than this Eurocom shooter, even if it does fall a little short in the AI and multiplayer departments.Wholeheartedly recommended.", "date": "Oct 19, 2000"}
