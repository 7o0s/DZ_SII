Very few developers outside of Nintendo are truly willing to take the risk of experimenting a brand new way of playing an established franchise, but Tecmo's Team Ninja did just that with its DS-exclusive design. The risk worked: Ninja Gaiden on the Nintendo DS is a really great game that offers a fresh, unique take on action games, and gives the touch-screen handheld gamers something that they'll never see on any other platform.   Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is a continuation, and not a port, of Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden franchise that it began on the Xbox a few years ago. Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword features the same character in the lead  Ryu Hayabusa  and the same brutal combo-heavy action as the console edition, but the DS game is its own design. The story revolves around Ryu and ~interest-slash-sparring partner~ Momiji, the quest for Dragonstones, and the origin of the Dragon Sword.   The new character Momiji plays such a strong role in this game that gamers actually play as her in Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword's intro level. It's a gameplay device that actually makes sense as she's not quite as skilled as Ryu is, and since this Nintendo DS throws out conventional control in favor of a unique touch-screen input, it's a great way to seamlessly train the gamer on how to play Ninja Gaiden on the DS system. And when she gets overwhelmed, it's a great plot device to have Ryu come in to save the day.   But the important question: just how different is Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword on the Nintendo DS? Well, for starters, the game is played in the system's 90 degree orientation; players hold the system in the ~book form~ popularized in Nintendo DS games such as Brain Age and Planet Puzzle League. This makes the screens taller instead of wide which opens up a bit more ~vertical~ gameplay. And it's still an arguable point, but the Nintendo DS feels pretty comfortable in this form, too.   Perhaps this was done mainly to emphasize the fact that the buttons and D-pad don't play a traditional role in Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword. The stylus is the focus. Slide it around to make the ninja move around the environment, similar to the way players guided Link around in The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. As enemies make their way on-screen, you use the stylus to slash at them: quick swipes across or up to down will send Ryu on a ninja-speed attack to that location. Of course, shurikans are a big part of Ryu's arsenal: quickly tapping in a location on the screen will have the ninja toss some bad boys in that spot. And if you need to jump, a quick flick of the stylus upwards will send Ryu leaping into the air for those high attacks.    The buttons and the D-pad have been relegated to one function: blocking. Take your pick, they all do the same thing. Blocking has a two-fold effect in Dragon Sword: obviously it's used to guard against attacks, but it also triggers the touch-screen's secondary ~defense~ mode. Tapping on the screen while guarding will have Ryu roll in the direction of the tap, which comes into play when you're being assaulted a little too much for comfort.    Even Ninpo abilities  those over-the-top Ninja Powers  are touch-based: if you have enough power, you can activate your Ninpo ability by tapping on the upper left of the touch screen to pull up the special command menu: select your earned Ninpo and then ~draw~ the character to charge it up and activate it to unleash a torrent of energy at the enemies in the area. All Ninpo effects are stylus controlled: roll a fireball around the area, or zap enemies with electricity with a quick tap of the stylus.     It's definitely a drastic change of input for the Ninja Gaiden series, tossing out tradition in favor of something unique. But it's a change that works, for the most part. It's definitely fun to have that direct ~slash at this enemy, and that enemy, and those enemies~ control, and the designers make sure you've got plenty of enemies to kill. Team Ninja even works some awesome combo strings into the mix using the limited amount of gestures in the game: upward swipe is usually designated a ~jump,~ but if you're in the middle of a combo string, a quick up stroke is an upward sword strike that sends the enemy into the air. Swiping up again will have Ryu leap up into the air, grab the enemy, and slam him down to the ground for an extra ~oomph~ that can also take out surrounding, weaker bad guys.   It's certainly fun and offers a whole lot of satisfying energy. But, you know, it's hard to ignore some obvious downsides. The limited controls definitely limits the game design: Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is much more action focused. Touch screen controls can get a little wonky so the developers limit any sort of platforming, limiting these instances to basic vertical wall-jump wells to get from one part of the map to the other, or incredibly basic Prince of Persia ~time the spikes in the floor~ challenges that are very loose and overly forgiving. And since you have a short list of moves to perform, boss battles are surprisingly easy to win; there's only so many things you can do, so patterns are very easy to see and exploit. And then you can run into some problems where quick taps will be recognized as strokes, screwing up potentially skillful combo strings or putting Ryu in harm's way.   Damn, does Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword look good or what?   But the designers put so much effort and energy into Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword that it's hard to nitpick at their design. Among everything else, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Yes, the designers ~cheat~ with a Resident Evil-like engine in this game, a cheat that features realtime 3D characters but prerendered 2D backgrounds. But with how much the game's pushing in visual effects it's clear why the designers went this route: there can be more than a half-dozen enemies on-screen, each animating with incredible fluidity at 60 frames per second. But the developers even tease their full 3D prowess with their stunning boss battles. Yes, most of them are easy to defeat, but man, these huge beasts are absolutely gorgeouseven when they're hideous monstrosities. Seeing these scenarios running a full 3D engine at 60 frames per second definitely makes you wonder what a Ninja Gaiden DS game using this engine entirely would've been like. Maybe for a sequel?   The overall difficulty isn't tremendously challenging, and it's certainly not as hard to finish as the console Ninja Gaiden games. You can plow through Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword in six to seven hours of game time, which, after a few inevitable trial-and-error deaths, boils down to about eight or nine hours. Beyond that, you'll unlock a much more vicious difficulty level, and you have the ability to get your scores ranked on the Ninja Gaiden Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection server. And there's a few hidden treats you can snag along the way, but to get them all you'll definitely have to play through the game at least twice.Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword kicks a whole lot of butt on the Nintendo DS. Visually, the game's a stunner, and the action is intense and almost non-stop. I don't think the game makes the ultimate case for touch-screen exclusive control in action games, and I certainly don't think stylus control is better than traditional control for the Ninja Gaiden design. But what Team Ninja created for the Nintendo DS definitely works in turning something traditional into something different and unique without forgetting about the fun, too.", "date": "Mar 7, 2008"}
