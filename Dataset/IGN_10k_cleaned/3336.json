So, it's understanding if many of you who adore the Olsens (as I do) also expected their videogame to be as super as Mary-Kate and Ashley. But too bad for you -- Acclaim actually had a great idea for a game here that would have been a good gift for a young gamers (or older gamers who still have ~You got it, dude~ in their daily vocabulary), but a driving game that isn't much fun to drive is already on bad tires.  Features  Drive around the neighborhood in a taxi, station wagon, sports car and more Race ATVs and Jet Skis in mini-game challenges Link Cable support to go driving with up to four friends Only for Game Boy Advance   It's anybody's guess how involved the twins are in making their own games (they've got a billion dollar conglomerate operation to run, don't you know), but I'd like to think that, when coming up with concepts for the Sweet 16 series, MK&A said, ~We'd like to have a game that teaches kids to drive.~ Because I can't see it being all Acclaim's idea, since I'm imaging that their response was, ~Uh, we dunno how to do that.~ The concept of a game where kids can play around with the rules of the road sounds fun, but MK&A: Sweet 16 - Licensed to Drive isn't that game.  It kind of tries to be that game, but it isn't. The developers at Powerhead at least started with that idea, but instead made more of a puzzle game than a driving game. Most of the roads, for example, are one-way streets -- unless this town is cracking down on cruising, there's not much call for level design this stupid. And it's not the normal every-other kind of one-way set-up, so you'll have to go miles out of your way and circle around whole city blocks because three streets in a row are all marked for the opposite direction, leading you to a turn that's also headed off the wrong way. Are we having fun yet?  It's all in the service of a game that wants to be a Crazy Taxi clone without all that craziness. As your slow-moving auto putts down the one-way roads, the girls will be driving packages and passengers (a game about teenagers picking up strangers?) to locations about town. The gas gague will be tipping towards empty on your drive, but with stations all over town, all the girls will really need to worry about is the timer (so, we're also teaching kids to speed?) You can also pick up bonus passengers, but unless their destination happens to be on the way (except for a few longer missions), it's usually impossible to get them to their randomly-picked spot in time to finish the stage. And the reward isn't worth it, since you only sometimes get bonus time for going out of your way -- a few extra points won't matter much if you'll have to restart the stage when time runs out anyway.  The rules of the road are probably the least of your worries -- heck, as confusing as the layout is, there's only one street to learn. (There's also only one racing course in the mini-game section-- the same for both the ATV and Jet Ski courses, just pallet swapped -- so don't count on much replay from the other goodies or multiplayer play.) What you really have to look out for is the moronic other drivers. They try to drive right, but it's a little hard in a city with no red lights or stop signs at intersections. Sometimes they stop, sometimes they just plow through -- in either case, you're in for trouble since your car doesn't drive or brake well enough to avoid most accidents. Fender benders will put you on a cop's list, as will driving down the wrong way of the road, so little accidents will put you closer to losing your license every time -- for instance, if you have to swerve down a road to avoid cars that stop in front of you, you're still handing over the keys. And what's with the goofy pretend rules in this game that just make no sense? When you hit another car, your car just gets dirty? And when your car is too messy, a cop will get on you to clean it before you pick up any more passengers? That's not something I learned in Driver's Ed.So, what have we learned here, kids? That it's OK to drive fast under pressure and pick up complete strangers in town, so long as you keep the car clean. Obviously, this game isn't much of an educational tool (and, if you're still not sure, a typical question in the Trivia mini-game asks what doesn't belong driving on the freeway, and the answer is ~a boat~.) It's also not much of a game, since there's only one city to explore and one easy race course to play. It looks like Mary-Kate and Ashley could still use a few more lessons, because this game is having its license revoked.", "date": "Dec 16, 2002"}
