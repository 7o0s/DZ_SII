{"name": "Monopoly Party", "name_review": "Monopoly Party", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/25/monopoly-party", "text": "One of (if not the) most popular and successful board games of all time has landed on the PlayStation 2 just in time for the holidays. Already available on the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox, Monopoly Party is the digital way to assemble you and your buddies for a quick roll of the ~virtual dice~ without having to break out the dusty box from your storage closet. With mechanics identical to the classic table top and a visual presentation that calls on the power of Sony's favorite videogame machine, you'd think that there would be little in this package that could go wrong. Especially when considering the several additions that have been made to make for a more unique experience on your television set. Unfortunately, that unique experience doesn't necessarily justify the price of admission here folks. I mean come on; this is Monopoly!   Party comes with plenty of options, some of which are actually pretty cool. You can choose from a variety of languages, including English, Spanish, and Italian. Though it's obvious that this title is clearly meant for the European market, as you can switch the currency from dollars to English pounds or Euros. But the Party doesn't stop there, as you can also adjust the rules to your liking; You can finally decide the long debate over whether Free Parking offers a jackpot or is just a neutral space. You can even set how much money actually goes into that jackpot.   To spice things up further, the look of the play board can be changed as well. The classic Monopoly setting is there by default with a number of specialized themes like Sci-fi, fantasy, prehistoric, and ancient monuments to switch between. These themed boards feature unique tokens and a variety of house styles to choose from. The properties are renamed to fit the theme and the center of the board features a 3D animated scene.  Prehistoric for instance, allow you to watch little dinosaurs romping around the center of the board. Add to this the fact that every token is animated and you have the ultimate type of Monopoly for Quaalude addicts.   The let down here is that properties have some really uninspired names. Since there's no license behind properties, you get generic names like ~Unicorn Road~ and ~Triceratops Terrace~. And the Chance and Community Chest cards aren't theme-specific, which is a let down.  They don't even have the little cartoon drawings on the cards that we're all so familiar with. To its credit, Monopoly Party comes with two modes -- Classic and Party, but the differences aren't all that great. With Classic you have to wait your turn, but in Party Mode you can all move simultaneously --Fantastic... or something.     Let's face it, this is Monopoly on the PlayStation 2. There's no system link and no online play feature that the PC versions have been sporting for years. Boo. Up to four players can get in on the fun sure, but this type of multiplayer action doesn't translate wel to a console in the least. No extra effort was made to use the console's power, and the feeling of anticipation and community you'd find when sitting in front of a table with the original just isn't there. A half-hearted effort at best.Hey, I'm all about family time, but buy yourself a real Monopoly board and play with your kids (or whoever you wanna play with). This looks and feels like a great budget PC game, but it's not that worthwhile on the PS2. Though you get several themed boards, they aren't as good as they could have been. Pressing X to roll some dice isn't nearly as enjoyable as rolling them yourself. I guess if you are lonely and want to play Monopoly against a computer's AI, uh, well, that's kind of sad, but understandable. Not bad technically, jsut somewhat pointless when you can get the real thing even cheaper.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
