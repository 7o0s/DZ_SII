Most of them are very well done thanks to the Xbox's graphics processing abilities but this has only lead to a glut of beautiful games that still don't do much to differentiate themselves. Rockstar San Diego (formerly known as Angel Studios) put together Midnight Club II (it's first appearance on Xbox) as genuine high speed arcade racer with online capabilities and the team as accomplished precisely what it set out to do. The biggest knock against Midnight Club II is that it is facing direction competition in the online arcade racer category and so it can't simply walk away with the crown on Xbox like it does on the PlayStation 2. While there are no major differences to justify the two additional months it has taken to bring MC2 to the Xbox, the game is solid with one of the best single player arcade racing experiences to date and an online component that'll add plenty of longevity.  Gameplay  Apparently there's this subculture of people out there that likes to race in the streets illegally and Midnight Club II is designed to capture this essence. You get wide open cities that can be roamed freely but during a race you'd better stick to the prescribed path if you want to win. The single player game is very well designed to get gamers used to the speed and mechanics of the vehicles and to get them familiar with the three cities --Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo-- they'll be racing in. Before races you'll get cruise time where you can ride around and find the character you want to race against. They'll lead you on a crazy path through the city to get you to a starting area. The ride over to the starting grid is how you'll learn some of the game's more obvious shortcuts and jumps that will come in very handy later on, perhaps even in the race you're about to undertake.   The races themselves will require you to race through a set of checkpoints in order or to race through them in any order but as quickly as you can. You'll have a rival in each race, usually the character that brought you to the race, and it's not enough just to beat them in a multi-car race. You have to beat everyone to unlock the new cars and advance you career. The AI in MC2 is extremely aggressive and there is absolutely no shame in resetting the race when you screw up even a little bit, because it usually will be catastrophic. Early on the enemy drivers will tap your bumper trying to get you to fishtail in the middle of a turn or run you down the wrong intersection or off-ramp.  Head-to-Head Available! Want to know if should buy the Xbox, PS2, or PC version of Rockstar's high-octane, inner-city racer? Just head over to IGN Insider to learn all about each version. In this feature we break down everything in a point-by-point comparison with side-by-side screenshots!  This is must-see material. And, if you already own the game, get the strategy guide.  Read It Now | Get the Guide   If the AI's toughness doesn't get you, then their realistic driving patterns will. Rockstar San Diego has developed technique that allows the AI drivers to think for themselves when it comes to decisions about how best to reach a checkpoint. The result is, no two races will run exactly the same because the AI drivers are reacting to dynamic traffic conditions just like you are and they'll take chances and make mistakes, just like you will. A wicked smile will cross your face when you see the race leader bend a corner right into the back of a semi-truck because you'll know that's something you could've done and still might. This element of the game alone is what really carries the single player campaign because in all of those race restarts, you may know the track you're on, but the other drivers will be the X-factor. Most other racing games, sim or otherwise, eventually become a contests to learn one kind of pattern or another quickly enough to satisfy your urge to see new cars and tracks. In MC2, you still have to learn how to take a corner with a minimal loss in speed but unlike a Gran Turismo or Project Gotham Racing you're having as much fun the 8th time through as you were the first time through. By your 25th attempt you should probably just give up and go try some Chessmaster or something.   The control and learning curve of Midnight Club II are also very well thought out and might go under appreciated by folks absorbed by the game's arcadey roots. The earliest vehicles you're racing are blessed with very tight but unrealistic handling that quickly gets you into the mindset you'll need through out the game. The slightest leans on the stick will cause the car to twitch and avoid obstacles at the last split second. This works perfectly with the game's sense of speed, one of the fastest we can think of outside the futuristic hover-racers like Wipeout. Hitting the nitro button delivers one of the most satisfying feelings of pure speed you'll ever get in a racing game because you're still very much in control of your vehicle and can hit ramps and bend corners with ease. Little things like using weight transfer to re-align your car in mid-air during a jump or drafting behind competitors to build up a free nitro boost are great real-world concepts applied to make an arcade racer even more fun and over the top. Your mastery over cars really pays off when you start racing motorcycles because of their unique controls, excessive speed and weak durability.   We have a deep appreciation for how well Midnight Club II transitions from offline to online racing. Basically you can do anything over Xbox Live that you could do on your own but instead of crazy aggressive AI, you're going against crazy aggressive humans. This only makes you appreciate the AI of the single player game even more since you'll be better prepared for online competition earlier than in most other Xbox Live games.   Just like you can in the offline game, you can cruise, race for checkpoints, battle in multiplayer games and even take your custom created races online to enjoy with complete strangers miles away. The only catch is you can only race vehicles and motorcycles online that you've unlocked in your single player game and so hosts can effectively set the experience level of a particular race by limiting what vehicles are eligible. Some may complain that this isn't fair, but as one who labors against the continued wussification of videogames, I say this is an excellent feature. Online is all about competition and if you don't have any game then you need to get some before matching up with real players.       Our biggest criticism of Midnight Club II is the dearth of unique multiplayer online games beyond just racing. Battling it out in Capture the Flag and Detonate with power-ups turned on is truly a blast but these are the only two non-racing experiences you can have online. The race editor is an outstanding that feature allows you to set the checkpoints and city for your custom race and proves to be the most enjoyable online experience. But it's still just more racing with online competitors when you get down to it. Knowing the variety and depth of multiplayer game options that are on the way in Midtown Madness 3, it's hard to believe MC2 couldn't have done more.   Graphics  The vehicles and environments in Midnight Club II are drawn to maximize framerate whether you're talking offline or off. Curves and rounded surfaces are tough to come by so the whole game has an angular from the buildings and freeway overpasses to even the sleekest-looking cars. That's not to say there's not an impressive amount of detail in the streets of Los Angeles Tokyo and Paris, because there is. The good texture work means you get buildings with working lights and even suggestions of furniture in the windows and lots of items in the store front windows as you mash down Wilshire in LA. This manages to make otherwise extremely flat boxy structures more alive and vibrant without clogging things up with additional polygons.   The vehicles aren't licensed but they are just barely detailed enough for you to make a decent guess at what car Rockstar is trying to rip off. The Cocotte is the first car you get to run with, but I'll be rusty oil pan if that sucker doesn't look like a late 1980s model Ford Escort done up with a cheap body kit. The SLF450X is obviously the Batmobile but Bruce Wayne won't come looking to sue Rockstar because the twin turbo thrusters make it look like one of those off-brand toy cars your folks used to buy to shut you up on the trip to K-Mart. Again the cars have a super low polygon count that might be in the double digits. This keeps the framerate nice and smooth and the surfaces shiny and reflective but the cars don't look any better than the ones in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on PlayStation 2. And you can get out of the car and terrorize a whole city with screwdrivers and flamethrowers in that game!   The best things to look at in MC2 are the particle effects and the nitro boost special effect. Smashing into light poles and crashing through glass doors on your way to a shortcut produces all kinds of tasty little shards and bits of interesting stuff ricocheting all over the place even at 146mph. The third person camera (recommended for an arcacey racer like this) already repositions itself as you change speeds to give you better views of the surrounding environment as you're going faster. When you hit the nitro boost button you get the single most satisfying element of Midnight Club II as the camera pulls back behind your car even further and the world streaks by like you're making the jump to lightspeed. The fact that you're pushing a low budget Escort knock-off suddenly doesn't matter during the few seconds of nitro powered racing.   Sound  The characters in Midnight Club II have some good voice acting behind them, they're just not as funny or interesting as they think they are. They've got all the stereotypical ethnic accents that the masses expect and that social activists detest. The characters you'll meet all have good info for you before, during and after races that'll help you get used to the game's controls and intricacies. This is especially important when you first get the motorcycle and have one shot to learn all of its cool controls and capabilities. It's definitely worth it to pay attention to what they're saying.   The music and engine sound effects are all very appropriate for the genre and the Dolby surround sound makes a huge difference. The licensed tracks are such deep underground tunes that you probably won't ever be cool enough to listen to them, not even with two leather jackets and a fuzzy Kangol. I'd run down some of the artists featured in the game's soundtrack but I'm afraid I'm not quite cool enough to even type them out. Plus there's no option for custom soundtracks and, last time we checked, only Electronic Arts neglected this feature in Xbox racing games. But you can get crazy and select the Los Angeles soundtrack when you're racing in Tokyo or do something insane like make all the songs in the game available to you at once.   The sound is very well balanced so that you always hear what you need to hear but you're also never bored with what you're hearing. Even with the engine revving and the music blaring you'll still appreciate subtle surround sound effects of getting passed by a motorcycle as you race through a tunnel or something complicated like that.  Midnight Club II might be the most complete arcade racer on the Xbox. It's the next generation answer for racing fans who've been waiting for the successor to San Francisco Rush. I can't deny how much pure fun I had blazing through the streets at speeds way too fast to be safe and I'm convinced that other games --not just racers-- need to bite what Midnight Club II did with its single player career mode. The Xbox Live racing is very well done even though I think Midnight Club II's online elements won't be able to match what's coming up in Midtown Madness 3. Some of the technical elements aren't what they could be but MC2 manages to do the improbable: it stands out from the crowd of Xbox racers.", "date": "Jun 5, 2003"}
