Seeing the Millenium Falcon take off from Tattoine left no doubt in anybody's mind what made that original Star Wars movie a Special Edition. This renewed feeling of excitement is what LucasArts was after with the Xbox ~exclusive~ Star Wars Starfighter: Special Edition. The only problem is, they couldn't squeeze enough ~specialness~ out of the original Starfighter on PS2 to warrant another spin around the Episode One galaxy. Even though it's on Xbox and well done at that, the bottom line is you've likely played a variation of this game already and you're not missing much if you skip this one.  Besides Lucas waited 20 years before revisiting his classic original film. LucasArts really should've waited more than a measly 10 months before re-doing this non-classic. That way, we would've had more time to let the original PS2 game seep deep into our collective memories and become a pop culture phenomenon.  Gameplay  The biggest differences between the PS2 game and the Xbox Special edition of Starfighter is the number of multiplayer games. The PS2 game only had two. Xbox has five, listed below:   CTF:Capture the flag. Basically, you grab the ~flag~ and take it back to your base. Dogfight:Simple one-on-one fight to the death. A staple in most multi-player action titles. Tag:One person is ~it~, and everyone else needs to get away from him/her. Hunter/Hunted:Sort of similar to Tag, one player is the hunter while the other is the hunted.  Steal the Bacon:Again, similar to CTF this mode only has one flag and you must fight over it.   Stealing bacon is fun and running away from other players trying to hunt you is fun as well. If you like the basic gameplay mechanics of Starfighter SE then those are two more great ways to apply your skills. But they end up feeling like modes that should've been included in the original PS2 game, not great new reasons to play this game on Xbox.   The story of Starfighter runs just prior to the events of Episode I. You follow the story of three spirited pilots --Rhys Dallows, Vana Sage and Nym-- who join forces against the evil Trade Federation just as they're initiating their blockade of Naboo. You have to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each one of their ships. For example, Nym's Havoc bomber isn't very agile, but it carries enough weaponry to destroy an entire base.   But in essence, Starfighter SE is the first Xbox game in the vein of Rogue Squadron, Battle for Naboo and Rogue Leader and plays as such. You have your basic escort missions where certain objects have to make it through safely, surface attack runs where certain installations have to be destroyed, and several variations of the basic space battle. One of the more complicated missions has you leading a raid on a convoy of frigates but you have to stay alive long enough to allow one of your comrades to board and take control of one of the frigates. That sounds cool but all you end up doing is dodging fire while you listen to your buddy taking over the ship. Your responsibility remains the same: kill and don't be killed. We've done this too many times before it seems, and there's nothing innovative enough here to justify doing it again on the Xbox.   The Xbox controller is well equipped for Starfighter's control system with analog triggers controlling your speed, the black and white buttons selecting targets and the analog sticks controlling roll, pitch and yaw. There's no upside-down in space and SFSE lets you keep it real with absolute directional control. You will definitely get around a lot easier than in GameCube's Rogue Leader because of a superior physics system. Starfighter SE is the first game I've played that allows you to pull a fishtail in a spaceship and actually put it to good use. But SFSE's good sense of speed and wide openness during space battles is balanced by the extremely low invisible ceiling and sometimes cramped feeling you get with surface battles.   There isn't much of a learning curve to Starfighter SE because you're more or less blasting away the whole time. Instead missions get more difficult because more objectives get added to your list of things to do. Learning to avoid damage and stay alive long enough to get to the next set of objectives is the key to the whole game.   Graphics It's not enough to say Starfighter looks better on Xbox because it could've and should've looked like this on the PS2. In the original game, you saw a lot of choppiness throughout the game especially on surface battle levels. To simply smooth out the framerate and use the same bland textures over again on the Xbox shouldn't qualify as a Special Edition.   But it is what it is. The framerate is silky smooth and even the cutscenes seem sharper and more vibrant because of the power of Xbox. There are plenty of videogames that can't even accomplish that. But the level of detail in the ships --in a game where all you can see are spacecraft-- is sorely lacking. I know the Naboo have a whole confluent philosophy in everything they design as a civilization, but the Queen's ship and the Naboo fighter aren't just silver and yellow slices of metal with thrusters sticking out of them. If I can't see any rivets or creases, then let me see how reflective and shiny the ships are when there's enough light around them. The Xbox is capable of a lot more than what we see in Starfighter SE.   Not much animation to speak of either. The only moving parts you ever see are the huge chunks of disintegrating cruisers and battle station and thankfully they only seem to break into 14 parts and float away cautiously.  Sound The voice acting is outstanding and, combined with the music, really get you into the mood for a good space adventure. While we won't fall in love with the stories of Rhys Vana and Nym like we did with the stories of Han, Luke and Chewbacca, you will get the feeling that this is a tale that definitely could've happened in the Star Wars universe.  Nym's baritone makes him come off as the celebrated pirate leader that he is. Rhys has the untested, yet ambitious tone of a rookie fighter pilot looking to prove a lot to himself and everybody around him. Not only that, but pretty much all of the mission-critical information you need to succeed is going to be spoken to you by all of the characters, some of whom you never even meet. Sure, you're given a list of the five objectives that have to be destroyed before each mission, but it's one of your buddies in the game that's going to tell you when and where to attack that manufacturing plant or defense turret.  All of the great ship, laser fire and explosion sound effects that we expect from a Star Wars game is included and very well done.     The last time I played a Star Wars themed space combat game it was the original Rogue Squadron on the N64. Yet, I can't help but feel like I'm repeating myself when playing Starfighter SE on Xbox, even though I skipped Battle for Naboo and the original Starfighter on PS2. Even if you ignore the built-in Episode I handicap --the ships, story and non-Jedi characters can't hold a candle to the original trilogy-- there are still some major issues with SFSE's value. The additional multiplayer modes, bonus missions and new unlockable ships, even if it is Darth Maul's, don't add enough novelty for anybody that's played this game on the PS2 already. It's a similar dilemma to Tony Hawk 2x. Adding a handful of new tidbits to a game that's 90% the same stuff does not a new game make.If you've never played a game like this in your life and you're jonesing because you've seen everybody drooling over GameCube's Rogue Leader, then this game is a barely adequate substitute. You'll be getting down with some space combat on Xbox but it's not a shining example of the genre or of the system's capabilities.", "date": "Dec 6, 2001"}
