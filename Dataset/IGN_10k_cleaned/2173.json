The company's NASCAR games have almost always been too niche for casual racing fans that didn't follow America's most popular sport, while never really being a true enough of a simulation to please the racing diehards.  Gameplay NASCAR Thunder 2002 doesn't really do much that'll likely win over extremists on either side, but the game's developers have managed to craft a NASCAR game that can be enjoyed by people that don't follow the sport religiously while still appealing to the people that do.  The largest new edition or change has got to be the inclusion of an awesome career mode that lets you create a driver and race for a championship over the course of multiple racing seasons. At the start of a career you can create a driver and car, and even choose the manufacturer (Pontiac, Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge), the paint style and color, and most importantly, the sponsors.   It's the whole sponsorship aspect of that really helps make the game a blast to play. You'll start off with offers, for both main and secondary sponsorships, of fairly low money amounts with simple requirements, such as finishing in the top 30 in two of the next three races or finishing ahead of a specific driver for some of the smaller logo deals. As you make money from accomplishing the tasks put forth by the sponsor and placing high in races, you can then use your winnings to increase the performance of your car by upping the horsepower, improving the handling characteristics and paying to improve the speed of your pit crew.   You will also be able to race to try and earn spots on other teams, as new drivers will enter into the NASCAR season while others will retire as you progress through a full career. The RPG-like nature of the career mode really does wonders in making the game a lot more fun to play and a little more accessible to those that aren't all that into this particular motor sport.   It obviously won't make anyone completely turned off by NASCAR racing change his or her mind. And the fact that the majority of the races take place on seemingly boring oval tracks (for those that aren't familiar with NASCAR, there are actually two road courses that contain right turns -- Sears Point and Watkins Glen) will undoubtedly make others turn their heads without a second thought. However, those that pass this title up will be missing out on a deep, challenging and enjoyable racing experience.  And it's not just fun because of all of the great stuff in the career mode, since all of that would be for naught if the racing weren't up to snuff. Thankfully the quality of the racing is quite exemplary. The thing that really does it in this area is the fact that Tiburon has somehow managed to put a full 43-car field on the track, which allows for a deeper and more realistic NASCAR racing experience. Where you'll see the most difference between a 43-car field and one half its size will be in the harder difficulty levels where you'll be thanking your lucky stars for the greater number of cars as you won't as easily fall completely out of the race when you make mistakes because there'll be other cars to draft.   And even though it's the aspect of the sport that NASCAR would rather you forget, the game sports some great crashes and a realistic damage model. The cars will dent, crumble and bend in varying degrees when hit and different parts of the car and knocked loose and completely off.  The AI of the competing drivers is also quite admirable, as they offer up a very realistic sense of racing against real-life opponents; though you won't really notice this much on the easy difficulty levels. And as is the case with everything EA, NASCAR Thunder 2002 is packed with all of the requisite features including all 23 real tracks, all of the car manufacturers, and many of the real drivers including Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarret, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Rusty Wallace. There are also five completely playable camera angles -- behind-car, behind-car far, full-screen view, a view where you see the hood, and the always popular view from the cockpit.   Though not nearly as enjoyable as its single player mode, the game features support for multiplayer racing with up to a total of four players with the use of a PS2 Multitap. The racing is somewhat limited, as one would expect, as there are only a total of 19 cars (not shabby at all) on the track in two player split screen games and four (only human controlled cars) in the four-player split-screen mode. The multiplayer racing is also somewhat limited in the number of camera views available as the cockpit view is no longer usable. Each is still fun, but should be looked at more like an extra feature for the game versus something to buy the game for.   Graphics Whether or not you consider the graphics in NASCAR Thunder 2002 to be good or bad will ultimately depend on the way you look at things. From a technical standpoint, the developers should be commended for getting all 43 cars on the track at once, with lots of nice lighting effects, reflections, realistic car damage, breakable parts, and other cool little effects without having to sacrifice the framerate. Not sure if it's 60 frames per second, but the framerate is non-wavering and doesn't falter at any point in the game even when all the cars are on screen in single player mode or in either the two-player or four-player split modes. It's quite impressive.  On the other hand, there are a lot of the ever-popular jaggies that the PlayStation 2 has become known for. The edges of the car models and just about everything in the backgrounds suffer from aliasing problems, causing the game to have a very unclean look. It's obvious that the developers were forced to decide which was most important -- the 43 cars, the framerate or the use of filters to cut down on the aliasing -- and they opted for the solid framerate and full race field. Good decision, if you ask me.  Sound The best thing I can say about the game's audio is ~SWEET HOME ALABAMA!~ That's the title and menu song and if you opt to not change it to the rock solution, I guarantee that you'll have those words and this song imbedded in your brain. You do have the option to change the country to rock and the honest truth is that both fit the ~NASCAR~ theme perfectly.  The engines sound great, there's also a lot of realistic pit chatter, and I honestly have no major complaints about the way the game sounds. My only wish is that they could somehow make the cars sound a little more powerful (maybe DTS -- and good use of a subwoofer) as turning up your stereo still isn't enough to get engine sounds that feel as powerful as the real deal. The biggest problem with NASCAR Thunder 2002 is that it's a NASCAR game. And before you NASCAR fans try to lynch me for this, please here me out. Racing on ovals just doesn't appeal to everyone and most casual gamers won't ever really see the little nuisances going from track to track and won't see the depth and skill involved in these races, as factors such as drafting, adjusting your car different from track to track, and learning how to take each left turn at the highest rate of speed without slamming into the wall won't be apparent for them. That said, this is one of the most enjoyable NASCAR racing games that I've ever played. As a simulation, it doesn't hold a candle to some of the games offered on the PC, but it makes up for it with its breadth of career mode features that help make it more than just a racing game, but a racing RPG of sorts. NASCAR fans won't want to pass this one up.", "date": "Oct 16, 2001"}
