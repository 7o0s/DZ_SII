Last year, Sony released a robotic action title known as Armored Core. This sequel, Armored Core Project Phantasma, is really what the Japanese market received as an update disk to the original that features new missions and options. In our case, it's a whole new game for those who never bothered to pick up the first one.  Like the original, Project Phantasma puts you at the helm of a one-robot army in which you run missions to earn cash that will enable you to upgrade your huge mechanized buddy.  You'll run through hostile territories, blowing up generators, structures, tanks, other robots  you name it. There are 17 missions in all, and to be quite frank, they're not easy.   There's a lot of management involved when you want to build a better robot. Not only do you have to have the cash to buy the items (legs for speed, head for targeting, arms for close-attacks, torso for guns, etc.), but you'll also need to make sure your on-board generator can handle the load of the new parts. If it can't cut it, you'll need to spend the dough on a better one, or make do with the old parts you had.  And like the original, the game also has both a split-screen and link-cable two-player mode, where gamers can see which robot truly has the right stuff.To be quite honest, I never, ever played the original Armored Core. That said, I feel Armored Core Project Phantasma is a decent mission-based action title, but it isn't for fans who like jump-in-and-play-style games. Project Phantasma requires a little bit of time to sit down and manage how you're going to build and upgrade your robot (I'm trying my darndest to not call them ~mechs~), and you can't just find the best legs, arms, and bodies money can buy  each needs the power to run it.Missions themselves range from stupidly easy to incredibly hard, and they jump around in difficulty throughout the game. The game's a challenge, I'll certainly admit that. Controlling your robot is pretty simple, except when your fingers slip off the shoulder buttons and accidentally cause the camera to rise or fall in the middle of the action.Armored Core Project Phantasma is not a high-key PlayStation title, but it's a fun action title in the same vein as a slower-paced version of Virtual On, especially in two-player mode.", "date": "Oct 20, 1998"}
