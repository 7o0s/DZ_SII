PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube owners are supposed to want it because at a glance it looks so much like the videogame phenom that has dominated the charts for two years, yet gamers are supposed to approach it with an open mind and take it for what it is. True Crime is an action game that allows you to drive around several hundred square miles of Los Angeles streets and seamless exit the car and interact with those same square miles of people, cars and criminals.  The greatest strength of this Luxoflux game, however, is the integration of story and layers of game design into one cohesive package that's makes the whole thing flow more like an interactive movie than anything. If the GTA games gave us a living city that reacted to almost all of our whims and left us on our own to generate fun for ourselves, True Crime gives us very specific things to do in that living city so that we might drive a genuine story. True Crime gives you a purpose and a consequence for every criminal you bag and every civilian or cop you blast, and the events of one mission are tied to the next mission all the way to the multiple ends of the game. However, some technical hurdles holding it back from being a completely successful PC port.   In the role of detective Nick Kang--the stereotypical hot-shot cop with an attitude problem that we've seen in dozens of Hollywood blockbusters and B-movies--you have the freedom to travel anywhere in the game's depiction of Los Angeles, and you can seamlessly go from driving to operating on foot with the press of a button. When you're on foot, Nick Kang can fight, shoot, flash his badge, fire in the air and roust suspects. Your driving skills from racing games will serve you well, but Nick can also auto-target or use precision aiming to shoot people or vehicles while driving. Using 24/7 training centers to improve his driving, shooting and fighting abilities, you can add even more functionality and offensive moves to Kang's arsenal but it's all done with a purpose.    You can tap the left mouse button to shoot ~from the hip,~ or hold down the button for a focused aim that will slow time to a crawl, allowing you to target things like car tires, or a thug who's using someone as a body shield. Steering with the mouse feels a little sluggish, but you can combine it with keyboard turning, using the WASD keys , for higher responsiveness. The cars tend to hug the road a lot more than in most racing games, and the emergency brake is, for some reason, ridiculously touchy. Anything more can a quick tap of the right mouse button can ruin a tight turn, or stop you on a dime. The driving keyboard controls are pretty well mapped by default.  The initial levels of the game are simple enough and will fool many, especially GTA veterans, into thinking they're getting a cheap and easy gameplay experience. But as you progress, the game is going to demand specific skills of you like the ability to shoot specific parts of an enemy's body or the ability to disable an escaping suspect's car with ease. These are skills that have to be earned by completing challenges at 24/7 training facilities scattered around the city. This integration is how you end up mastering every skill available in the game and experiencing all True Crime has to offer. It's linear in that some events and challenges have to happen before the other, but the beauty is you're still getting the freedom to choose what you'll do and when you'll do it.   You'll notice you'll barely be passing most missions if you don't take the time to upgrade your skills. We're talking about beating minibosses with a sliver of health left and racing to locations with only 2 seconds to spare. You get the feeling that you should be better than that and the truth is you should. You just have to find how and where you want to invest in your skills. This is yet another subtle way that True Crime pushes you. And before you know it, you're hours deep into a game that you thought you'd knock out in an afternoon.      The good cop/bad cop system, where you can be a vigilante of a knight in shining armor, is important at specific crossroads in the game that will require that you have a good cop rating to advance. Otherwise, you're headed towards a less-than-great ending to the game. Your karma rating will most likely be low early on because your unskilled Nick Kang will be popping innocent civilians, rolling up on sidewalks at high speed and killing pedestrians and all kinds of stuff that you'll think is just part of being a cop in LA. The thing is, True Crime lets you hop in and out of any missions and episodes that you've unlocked so that you can re-insert yourself into the storyline at any point and replay specific elements. For example, if you're a really bad cop and you know you're missing the good cop storyline (which leads to the good endings) you're best served by hopping back to a driving mission somewhere so you can solve some random crimes or even get some new combat or shooting skills so you can replay the main missions with more success. You improve your cop rating by arresting instead of killing and by generally showing restraint in all situations. The challenge, as we said earlier, is showing restraint when you have no choice but to bust a cap in somebody's ass.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer that many of us have been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget. You get no fewer than five distinctly different modes, but I can only really recommend The Beat, where you compete against others to ~resolve~ the highest number of random crimes in a given amount of time (either sixty seconds or four minutes). Perhaps Ironically, I recommend it the most because you have the freedom to play it however you want, comepletely ignoring the objectives and just going after your fellow players, shooting up their cars and banging into them. This only works, of course, if the other players are game for this no-holds-barred approach, otherwise it would be just griefing. You get plenty of character models to choose from, a customized license plate, and bunches of cars that all generally behave as they should--the city bus is a lumbering beast, the S2000 is quick and speedy, and the Imapala floats like a true road yacht.    Unfortunately, the other race modes aren't as good. You get the waypoint street race a la GTA3 and Vice City, but it's only one WP on the map at a time, instead of giving you a smaller, differently colored dot on the map that shows where the next WP will be after that. And while it's very cool to race around a faithful re-creation of Los Angeles, the complete lack of traffic and pedestrians for all race modes makes it both unintentionally spooky and a little boring. What is LA without at least a constant stream of cars everywhere? The last race mode, where you play either an officer or a fleeing suspect, is over way too quickly and the suspect has to put an unreasonable amount of distance between himself and the squad car. I found it was much simpler and less unsatisfying to simply wheel around and open fire until his car exploded. This still didn't quite do it for me, because all the multiplayer cars are tough as rhinos and ammunition is unlimited, making it less like a game and more like a cartoon.  The on-foot combat modes, Dojo Master and Battle Master, feel more like minigames than full-fledged modes. Dojo Master, the melee mode, has exactly one round. You knock the guy out and boom, the round ends and you're kicked to a summary screen. And the camera was just plain not right, seemingly unable to properly pull back and frame the scene. I had to move myself out of the way of the camera many times so I could see what was going on. Battle Master, also known as ~last man standing,~ is also exactly one round, with very small maps and only one life per player. All in all, multiplayer doesn't rise to the level of something I'd recommend over, say, Multi-Theft Auto.  The interactivity of True Crime's Los Angeles is outstanding even if there seems to be a shortage of traffic and diversity among citizens at any given time. In single-player, you can punch, shoot or search any NPC at anytime. Attacking for no reason, however, will raise both your bad cop rating and the civic unrest meter. When you get critical civil unrest, the SWAT team will be dispatched and you will get smoked. It takes a lot of death and damage to send the civil unrest meter soaring.       If there are three thugs robbing somebody you have to arrest all three to solve it perfectly. The thing is the average citizens in True Crime are far more active and aggressive than the ones in either GTA game. We've witnessed sequences where we rolled up on a random crime scene in Nick's custom cop car, started fighting the suspect, who then hopped in our cop car and took off. We chased him down in a slow truck, incapacitated our now stolen cop car, the suspect then got out, put up more of a fight and then stole the slow truck we arrived in and left us sitting there with our burning, flat-tired cop car. Considering that a suspect or two can even brandish a pistol, sword or bottle at any point during that sequence, it's safe to say the game will keep you on your toes. And while the tendency is to ignore the random crime generator early on, it soon becomes your best friend and ally. That's right around when the crimes themselves become a lot more dangerous and complicated.   While the console controls in True Crime weren't as intuitive as they could have been, things have been beefed up considerably for the PC--but it still falls short, thanks mostly to the lack of gamepad support. In melee combat, you can now pretty much lock onto an enemy, pulling back for a block, clicking the left mouse button to punch, right mouse button to kick, middle mouse button to jump kick, and a few other moves. However, the WASD keys aren't really an option, thanks to the special moves system being moved all the way over to the keypad. To grab someone, you press E, but from there, the special grab combos require pressing, say, 4, then 5 on the keypad to complete the move. There's just no good way to map all the extra stuff onto a keyboard. Plus, the same awkward camera movement we saw on the consoles during the hand-to-hand combat scenes plagues the PC version. Your basic punches, kicks, flying kicks and throws are basically setups for the combos, finishers and throw moves you can unleash when you dizzy your opponent. Facing tougher opponents ends up making the fights scenes look like something out of The Matrix with all kinds of blocks and counterpunching. You can add running moves, ground attacks and group counterattacks through training, but they all blend together seamlessly in one nice fighting system. It's one of the best ways to interact with the Streets of LA. However, although the unlockable movelist is well designed, the PC control scheme brings it back down to earth.     The graphics also suffer from some corner-cutting. You never get a loading screen as you motor around the hundreds of square miles of Los Angeles and much of the LA you see can be destroyed either by fist, bullet or bumper. On the other hand, the camera can get hung up behind walls and will fight you more often than it should, especially when you're on foot and the auto-targeting system detects and enemy nearby. Then again, you're getting an extremely accurate representation of Los Angeles down to the streetlights, landmarks and quirky neighborhoods. It's not that the driving elements look better or worse than the on-foot segments of the game. Each part has its strengths and weaknesses but the sum total is just north of decent. Unfortunately, there's a lot of texture popping on the PC version, particularly with fences and some low walls de-stealthing right in front of you, turning a nice alleyway shortcut into an expensive repair job.   We also noticed some extremely odd physics glitches, with invincible hedgerows, cars vaulting into the sky when hitting a stationary object, and some decidedly low-budget smoke effects. At one point, I'd totally trashed this one poor motorist's car, and it was sitting in the middle of the street, in flames. The flames were shooting up, however, as fast as a hurricane wind, in a weird, thin stream that completely disappeared if you tilted your point of view towards the sky. Plus, it's just plain dumb to not be able to shoot through a car window or windshield, unless you're using the focused aim. I had this one guy in a Wrangler, with his window down, and I was shooting him point-blank, to no effect. As soon as he left the hitbox of the vehicle, however, he went down easily. This makes it extremely and unnecessarily difficult to deal with (1) someone who's trying to run you down and (2) someone who's trying to get away from you in a car chase.      The list of the good stuff when it comes to True Crime's graphics includes the well done cutscenes that come complete with lip-synching to go with all of the marvelous voice actors involved with the game. Their faces are all highly detailed and expressive, but the character models are only middle-of-the-road, as we saw in Mafia and Max Payne 2, to a lesser extent. Garbage, benches, tables and nearly any other item that looks like it would be breakable in real life can be smashed up convincingly, though, which provides a pleasing degree of interactivity. The animations during the fight sequences are also surprisingly well executed. Considering you've got an entire city represented, the fact that Nick looks as good fighting indoors as he does outside, is very impressive. As you unlock new moves and throws, the grappling and striking animations get more complicated and you can appreciate the difference from one move to the next. Even if the move has an inane name like ~Kung Pao~ it looks awesome, at least.   The list of bad things about TC's look includes many technical hang-ups. There are far too many clipping issues that come up far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so that there will be times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all. If the fight flows in such a direction so that the camera dislodges itself from said wall, you might see that Nick and his opponent are both ~phasing~ into and out of trees, cars, bus benches or any other piece of the environment during their fight like a couple of pissed-off ghosts. True Crime is indeed an ambitious game, but it doesn't mean that an intelligent camera system and a solid-looking game environment aren't requirements. These problems are just too significant to overlook.   Another problem with rendering all of LA is nailing the right amount of traffic, both vehicle and pedestrian, flowing around the city. There are only a handful of NPC models available in the game but you only see a handful of them at any given time. That is, when you're out on the street rousting suspects, you may grab the same guy twice because there will be six dudes that look just like him on that particular block. Same for cars. At times, the streets will have nothing but SUVs and taxis out there, even though there won't be nearly enough of them. The next time you're out, there will be lots of cabriolets and luxury sedans. Inexplicably, you can have all out fist fights in the fast lane on any freeway whenever you want. Bumper-to-bumper traffic is the lifeblood of the City of Angels, and this game needs a transfusion.    The representation of the streets of Los Angeles might be the real star of the game. While accurately depicting every McDonalds and Starbucks spread across the I-10 corridor from downtown to the beaches would've been nice, we're quite impressed with the fact that every single street, avenue and boulevard is right where it should be. The rough parallelogram (you never thought you'd hear that one from us) defined by Pacific Palisades to the northwest, Marina Del Rey to the southwest, Downtown LA to the southeast and Los Feliz to the northeast is the sandbox for True Crime, and every nugget of pavement between those points is as it should be. So much so, that Los Angeles natives--or anybody who knows their way around La La Land--will have a tremendous advantage when it comes to the timed driving portions of the game. If you've used a shortcut down a back alley to dodge the cops in real life, it'll probably serve the same purpose in TC. Unless the level designer put a fence in.  The audio elements of True Crime, however, are quite good, although the PC version suffers from noticeable audio compression during dialogue. Nick Kang's lines are also extremely corny, although it's a matter of taste I personally didn't mind for the most part, except for the fact that he has only a few ~situational~ lines. For example, whenever he hops into a car, he almost always says, ~Time to hit the road, Jack--er, Nick.~ We've all seen a ton of cop movies set in LA and from Eddie Murphy to Josh Hartnett, and none of them strikes the balance of relatively cool yet still embarrassingly corny that Nick Kang pulls off. For every good line he has like ~Double up on these, bitch!~ he's got two hokey ones like ~It's dim sum time!~ and the aforementioned ~Kung Pao!~ Those are so bad, we're not even going to give you the context in which they're used. It doesn't matter. The comments from NPCs on the street are at least as varied and humorous as any that you might've heard in either GTA game. Thankfully, the irrepressible Christopher Walken makes up for the excessive corn with cool lines and even cooler delivery.   The sound effects aren't quite as polished, playing second fiddle to the voice actors and hip-hop artists. Even the radio dispatcher drops the occasional comedic gem when she's alerting you to some crime and/or the participants involved. The dry delivery when she's telling you about a Hollywood celebrity buying drugs on a street corner is priceless. Christopher Walken outshines all however as Kang's buddy and mentor when he takes over a flashback cinematic or other story advancing bit. He's also the voice you'll hear when you take on a 24/7 training challenge. His line when you pass or fail is short but sweet with a ~Yo Slick! You rock/suck!~ It's classic Walken and the very reason he was included in this game.   The music in True Crime is organized to match the action on the screen so there's a driving mix, a slow action mix and a fast action mix of songs. With the scores of tunes featured in the game, we heard the same ones an awful lot. Wwe enjoyed most of them, but looking at the list and hearing the same handful of each mix over and over again seemed a little fishy. This is partly due to the fact that when you restart a mission you're restarting the song progression for the soundtrack. If you take 17 tries to beat a driving mission, you might hear ~Flashlight~ 17 times. Fortunately, you can filter what songs you want and don't want to hear, although there's no option to add you own MP3s into the mix. True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations. The integration of story and gameplay is well done, but there's a strong possibility that the majority of people won't get it at first because the tendency will be to play this game as if they already know what they're doing. The consequences of your actions and non-actions are huge in True Crime and dramatically change your level of recklessness. It's a storyline that unfolds like a criminal investigation in a good cop show, but imagine that you can hop into any point in that show and interact with characters to change the outcome.Unfortunately, the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked, sadly. This is no Multi-Theft Auto.", "date": "May 28, 2004"}
