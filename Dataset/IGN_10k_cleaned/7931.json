{"name": "Assault Rigs", "name_review": "Assault Rigs", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/assault-rigs", "text": "On first glance, Assault Rigs seems to resemble the tank sequences from the movie Tron: drive a CG tank through neon-lit, gridded arenas while shooting at other CG tanks. Its cool for a little while, but after playing through a couple of the levels, you realize it isn't going to change.  The control is generally pretty smooth, and the tanks move along at a swift pace, but herein lies the first problem; how many tanks do you know that move quickly? Realism aside (these are CG tanks after all) the game does control well. The graphics are decent, if a little uninspired. The initial wave of grid-levels begins to wear thin, but the later levels are more varied, and offer more of a challenge.  Unfortunately, Assault Rigs never really delivers. The music's cool, and the whole Tron-like layout is neat, but after awhile you find yourself longing for some light-cycles or luminescent frisbees to throw around. Get it if you want to complete your Synopsis collection, but other than that, it's strictly a renter.", "date": "Nov 21, 1996"}
