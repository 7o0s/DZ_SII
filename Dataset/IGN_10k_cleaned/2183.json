And though it's not a substitute by any means, Majesco's own Boxing Fever for the handheld may fill the void temporarily for those diehard fans out there...because it's obvious that this Digital Fiction-developed action game has Nintendo's own boxing title to thank, just a little bit, for its design. And for folks who aren't familiar with the series...hoo boy, are you in for a treat. Boxing Fever is a maniacal-but-strategic first-person fighter that's a heck of a challenge in single and multiplayer modes. Features Eight playable characters Two boss characters Championship and practice modes Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  The game is a pretty cut-and-dry design, but that just makes it even friendlier as a pick-up-and-play title on the handheld. Players can duck and punch both high and low, as well as weave left and right with the shoulder buttons to avoid the stronger hits. The player must ~read~ the opponent, watching his motions -- if he's got his gloves up high, then he's more likely to block and punch the face...down low, he's protecting and going for the gut. If players continue to whale on the opponent without any sort of strategy, he'll find himself fatigued early in the match, which makes his punches much more slower to pull off. The task is to pummel your opponent until he hits the canvas three times...and this objective gets more difficult as you progress through the ranks.  The game features ten different fighters, but they all have the same abilities -- they're just balanced according to size. One fighter may be quick, but the hits may not be as punishing. On the flipside, a huge fighter may seem sluggish, but land a few solid hits, and the opponent will be hitting the canvas very, very quickly. Players can learn about character attributes, special moves and combos in the informative training mode outside of the regular game. Fighters can also pull off super moves, but they require a couple seconds of charging...which leaves your character vulnerable to attack. And in a game where you're hit every half-second, these charge punches are a rarity. These punches would be much more useful if your opponent could get stunned by a specific series of punches, but unfortunately that doesn't happen in Boxing Fever. But the strategy of blocking and punching is more than enough challenge in this game, especially when the competitors get crazy in their techniques up in the higher levels of the championship modes.  The developers of Boxing Fever put together a very slick graphic engine for the game, with massive characters and multiple background layers scrolling all over the place to give off an excellent illusion of 3D. The fighters themselves are a bit on the low color side, but the various rings are rendered with a decent amount of color -- I'm guessing that the low color fighters are so that the developers could offer more frames of animation for the ten rendered models that literally fill the screen.  The game's structure is Boxing Fever's low point -- the developers don't encourage the normal climb up the Championship ladder by hiding the later, more challenging rounds. Each of the four championship levels are available from the start. These levels should be hidden from view until the player accesses them by winning the previous rounds. And a battery would have added so much more to the gameplay, as players would be able to track their characters' wins and losses for real instead of the useless statistics that's offered for each fighters' bios, as well as give players the ability to build up a fighter from scratch...the password engine in Boxing Fever doesn't even tell you what data's saved with each successful eight alphanumeric string.  But Boxing Fever's high point? Link cable play. This is something that the pattern-based Punch Out could never really offer -- grab two systems and two cartridges, and you can go head to head against a friend in an absolutely flawless Vs. mode. This two player mode is a must -- the computer AI in this game is really good in its own right, but nothing beats fighting an actual human opponent...and this mode adds so much to the replay value of Boxing Fever. Though Punch Out is the boxing game most die-hard gamers are hoping for, Boxing Fever is an excellent action boxing title on its own...it may borrow just a tiny bit from Nintendo's series for its design, but Majesco's and Digital Fiction's title focuses more on strategy than Punch Out's emphasis on pattern recognition. And its two player mode is absolutely fantastic -- if you can score another copy of this game for a second system, you won't regret it.", "date": "Oct 23, 2001"}
