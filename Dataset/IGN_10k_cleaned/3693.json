{"name": "Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory", "name_review": "Enemy Territory Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/03/enemy-territory-review", "text": "So singleplayer Enemy Territory was wiped from the face of the Earth by the mighty Activision hand like God cleaning up that whole dodo bird mess he made... Ha, I say. The belligerent level designer who proudly proclaimed he'd release ~his~ game when it was done in front of a baffled me and an even more baffled Activision rep at 2002's E3 ain't laughing now. But aside from him, who really cares? We get multiplayer and we get it for free. No amount of B.J. and bulletproof skeletons could improve that sales pitch. It's free, stupid.   But (here comes that mom voice I've dreaded for so many years), ~A lot of what can be described as free can also be described as syphilitic in quality.~ Mom is a fountain of knowledge. The way she sees it, slaps in the face, kicks to the crotch, falls down the stairs, and a roll with any of Dan's relatives are all free, but none of these are something a sound of mind, typically frail gamer would seek out and enjoy. Don't worry, sweetie, unless ~Dunce69666~ is on the server and representing the retarded, team-killing donkeys of the world, the Enemy Territory experience won't be anything like getting a playfully molesting, sweaty hug from Tal (the equivalent of falling down stairs while being kicked in the crotch just after a slap to the face from a relative of Dan's you were just intimate with). Whee.  Yes, it's free. Just pay for an Internet connection, a thousand dollar PC and likely a subscription to some random downloads site to get it. But that's better than 50 bucks for the first game and 20 for the expansion. Free is also one of the more endearing qualities of Enemy Territory. Scream it out -- it's almost euphoric. The satisfaction of valiantly covering an air strike marker with your own body to prevent falling explosive death from obliterating the hapless squad of persistently charging marines you call comrades is also pretty damn neat. If you survive and get up when the smoke clears, the fact that you're doing it all for free and are still about to relish in the destruction of another is more than enough to make this package worth the price of admission, which is still absolutely nothing. But does a cost of zero and an exploding Nazi make the game good?  Yes, yes, yes and a little bit of no.  Enemy Territory is all the glory of Wolfenstein multiplayer only different and with some more, yet with some less. It retains enough to be familiar and it also manages to add some things that just don't sit well with avid players of the original. When coupled together, the changes, additions, and combination of newness/familiarity (like playing a sequel to a beloved game) are compelling reasons to invest time in play, but won't be enough to convince the invisible girlfriend that she needs to provide more space and time to allow for a little unadulterated Battlefield action on the weekends. It's the slick allure of squad-based action, for sure, but it's so little, and so much like its progenitor in so many different ways, that when taken as a product on its own, it will certainly be passed by in a matter of days or even weeks. Those days, though...hot damn will they be fun.  When playing a team-based action title, it's of some importance to fulfill a role in the team. Think of IGNPC. If each of us did not fulfill our own distinct roles with vigilance, we'd not operate as unsuccessfully as we do. We need Dan to curse at real-time strategy games, we need Stephen to wander away from his desk for hours on end, and we need me to threaten inanimate objects with bodily harm as if they were real and could be coerced. Likewise, the medics have to be the medics, the field ops have to be the field ops, the engineers have to be the engineers, the covert ops have to do whatever it is they pretend to do, and the soldiers have to be the soldiers. When it works, it works beautifully.   Because fixing tanks and setting dynamite isn't always the best thing in the world, players are kept more enthused about fulfilling a distinct role because of the ability to earn a number of rewards. Rankings and experience points are offered. Rank makes a happy, ingratiated gloater. Points makes a lethal soldier. A medic who moves from would-be corpse to corpse breathing life into those brave men bullets left for dead can advance with new abilities. If said medic lives through many firefights, more points are earned, battle awareness is gained, abilities are learned, play distinctly differs. Nice. These points are used to automatically promote soldiers up through the ranks. With each new rank comes a new ability (self adrenaline that supercharges stamina), higher special medic ability use, more robust syringe healing, dual pistols, quicker reloads, etcetera. Each class of character has abilities that can be improved, but only if you play to improve them. This setup, however noble, is not without its shortcomings and certainly not without its consequences.       People slaughtering you and everyone else on your team so that they can accomplish objectives and earn themselves a higher ranking is peachy. It's a new kind of team killing for those wanting higher ranks, which doesn't make sense since experience only lasts through a single campaign (three maps). It's not like you become this bad ass, unstoppable monster. Once the campaign is done, the rank is gone. Of course, these criminal scum do such nefarious things so that their names can be on the rankings list at the end of each match and ~W00t! Dat's wat it's all 'bout, yo! I'm just good.~  Complaining is a way to offset this madness. When team killed, an instant ~file a complaint~ prompt pops up. If it keeps coming, the kid could get booted. Unless a server is setup correctly and a moderator has a steady index finger on the eject losers button, it can still be a problem. The simplified voting and streamlined complaining do help substantially, however.  Thankfully, for as many sad saps as there are, there is an equal amount of quality players, which makes the game shine real bright. Objective-based teamplay is pretty much Wolfenstein with a hell of a lot of tweaks. It's the same brisk pace, the same kinds of shootouts, only slightly different. On the plus side, fans of the original will find little fault here. But as a minus, little things like a stamina bar that's not as penalizing on bunny hoppers than it should be and some ridiculous, ~he shouldn't have been able to shoot me from there~ scenarios can get frustrating.   As a whole, even though only six maps are offered, each is designed and balanced enough so that if proper teamplay mechanics are used and the server is not setup to be lame (infinite lives, no friendly fire, everyone has no fun slider pushed to the max), the game flows well.   True to Wolfenstein, each of the maps has built in objectives -- some move, some don't, all require the use of specialized classes. Objectives, in addition to canyons, doors, hallways, and other architecture designed into the levels, all act as choke points. Fire teams help keep things coordinated. A map broken down into a grid tells the location of others in your fire team, but just because you know where they are, that doesn't mean you'll all work together like happy elves in the Keebler tree. I know exactly where Fran is. Do you see me helping him write an article? I think not.  Thoughtfulness like the fire team implementation carries over to some aspects of the game, but is then omitted in others. Weapon spray seems a little off, bunny hopping is out of control, out-of-the-box UI driven character customization is limited, the map functionality isn't all it could be, the compass could improve (circling indicators for medics, engineers, and field ops like targets around the HUD in Freelancer would be awesome). With all of this said, there's still enough satisfaction to keep the game frantic and fun, for a time.   What did you think of Enemy Territory?  Try to forget that you have six maps to play with and focus on the good. Playing a role, now made grand by these newly offered incentives, is sweet. And, there's enough variation to be had in each of the roles that it's never boring. Being a medic and darting around a bursting battlefield is a rush. Arming yourself with a heavy machinegun and going prone on a banister to mow down whoever runs in the way is empowering. Laying out artillery to support the troops is great. But each of these has a few disadvantages. Pray when you lie down as a gunner that no one stands on your back or directly behind you and cuts your firing arc in half. Hope when you're dying as a medic that you don't get passed up by inconsiderate mates. Watch as depth perception challenged field operatives lob air strikes ten feet in front of themselves and ruin everyone's day. It's good and bad, all the time.  Somewhat attributed to minor faults in underlying game design, but largely attributed to problems inherent with every game that requires people to play, the negatives of Enemy Territory are overwhelmed by so many positives in terms of fluidity, solidity, value, graphics (same Wolf coolness but it can look a little old), and good to decent to non-present sound, that it's pretty much undeniable for what it is, free, new, fun.  Not the perfect balance of coordinated action and high-end graphics many might have been hoping for, nor is it as robust a package as America's Army, Enemy Territory still manages to offer a solid change from a pace set by Battlefield. At the same time, it's an appreciable graphical upgrade above the tight action of Day of Defeat and a solid extension on tried and true Wolfenstein combat.Will it dethrone reigning champs? Un-bloody-likely. What it will do, however, is provide everyone with a computer and a connection to the World Wide Piece of Crap a lot of fun for the weekends. After successfully blasting through the scant six maps and enjoying all of the fleeting newness, expect Enemy Territory to sit idle in the games folder filled with so many quality shooters. As good as it is, it's just not enough to hold lasting interest.Still, Activision's deliberate omission of a box and a price tag keeps this one worthwhile regardless of your action preference.
