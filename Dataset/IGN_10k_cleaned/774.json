Where are the 1080s?  The Cool Boarders?  The MTV Snowboardings?  The only decent snow-shredder we PC owners have is ESPN X Games Pro Boarder, and it's getting rather dated by now.  But now there's a new kid in town ... Boarder Zone.  The title formerly known as Supreme Snowboarding really caught our eyes when we saw it at last year's E3.  Even in its infancy, it was one of the best looking titles at the big show, so we've been waiting in wet anticipation to see how the final game turned out.  Well now the wait is over and we have to say, we're pretty impressed with our latest PC snowboarding entry.  The first thing you'll notice about Boarder Zone when you start playing is that the graphics blow away any other snowboarding game ever -- on aay system.  While most of the winter titles have relied on simply laying down a fairly flat white surface accented with very sparse details, Boarder Zone is truly a feast for the eyes.  The art team at Housemarque did a fantastic job at recreating realistic snowy environments, and added plenty of special touches that make the game shine ... literally. The spectacular lighting effects are some of the best you'll find in any game, and it's these lighting effects that had everyone in the office ~oohing~ and ~aahing~ while I was tearing up the slope.  Housemarque employs a lot of little tricks like multiple shadows, reflective surfaces, various times of day, and weather effects that make Boarder Zone one great looking title.  Little details like the snowboard trails left by other competitors really add a lot to what could have been just another generic racing title.  Of course, since you're speeding down the side of a mountain, you might miss many these touches during the race, but don't fret.  You'll be able to appreciate all of the things you missed while you were trying to concentrate on staying upright in the automatic replay after you finish each race.  All of this graphical power will require a workhorse of a system to run smoothly, and I wouldn't suggest anything less than a 300MHz machine with a fast 3D card if you're looking to pick up Boarder Zone.  Otherwise, the game is just too choppy to play at the higher detail levels, and you don't want to miss out on the graphical acuity of this title.  While the game features a halfpipe run and a big air competition, at its heart Boarder Zone is a racing game, and there's one element that every racing game must have to keep people coming back -- interesting tracks. Boarder Zone accomplishes this goal with ease.  The powder-heavy courses are all well designed with plenty of multiple pathways.  I played each of the nine courses many, many times and I still found new paths and shortcuts almost every time I played.  While nine courses might seem limiting at first, the multiple trails make each race almost a different experience each time you play.  Another aspect I like about the racing portion of Boarder Zone was that there is absolutely no room for error on the races, so Boarder Zone forces you to get better and better if you want to unlock the closed tracks and progress through the game.  It's not like many racing games where if you screw up the pack slows down and waits for you to catch up again.  If you fall, they're off and your frozen butt is left behind.  Of course your AI competition will fall too, but it usually takes a perfect run to win a race. It's difficult to win some of the races, but I for one like challenging games and this was refreshing to see in the usually all-to-easy racing genre.  The more extreme events in Boarder Zone -- the halfpipe and big air competitions -- are also a lot of fun, but seem like they were added as a topper to the racing portion of the game.  Each of the events is very short and, while there are plenty of trick combos you can pull off while flying through the air, there just aren't that many tricks in Boarder Zone. It's not a trick game where you can race, it's a racing game with tricks.   While overall Boarder Zone is an extremely good looking title that offers up a good bit of fun, it does have its share of problems.  For starters, there's just not much to the game.  You can race (either against other boarders or against the clock), shred the halfpipe, and sail through the atmosphere in the big air competition ... but that's about it.  And as good as the graphics look, there are a slew of little graphical glitches that should have been fixed before the game was shipped.  The worst of these are the numerous clipping problems and the stiff and uninspired character animations. With the beautiful scenery, I was just expecting more out of the animations.  It really would have given the six characters more personality if their movement were more fluid.  Sound effects are also lacking in Boarder Zone.  What's there is recorded well, but there's just not much to it besides the occasional whoosh of your board and a few ~ughs~ when you run face-first into a tree.  One of the most frustrating quibbles I personally had with the game is that there is no way to remap the buttons on a gamepad.  This game just screams for a gamepad, and you're forced to use the default settings.  I realize it's a small problem and the default settings were easy enough to get used to, but c'mon -- it's the 21st century and we still have to use some pre-designated controller setup?  That's just ridiculous.  There also isn't much to the multiplayer side of Boarder Zone.  There's no Internet option, but you can play with up to eight people over a LAN.  Even so, though, the game is laggy and we encountered several crashes when setting up games.  It can be fun when it works right, but there's nothing special about it so if your raison d'tre is multiplay, then you'll want to look somewhere else.  Like any game, Boarder Zone has its highs and its lows, but overall it's pretty damn fun and it offers up something new for us PC gamers who don't have many choices when it comes to snowboarding games.  And with a price tag of around $30, Boarder Zone is well worth the money.  Sure, it's not Homeworld or Baldur's Gate, but how deep does a snowboarding game need to be?  What Boarder Zone does offer is plenty of simple fun.  It's one of those games that's perfect to load up for a brief play session and get your ya-yas ... it's just not something you're going to want to sit down with for an eight-hour session.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 11, 2000"}
