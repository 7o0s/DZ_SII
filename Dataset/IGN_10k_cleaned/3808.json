I went over to their booth at E3 and spent some quality time playing a beta build of FS 2004. I was so impressed with it I ran out and bought a fully souped up Dell XPS in anticipation of this game's release. Boy was it worth it... but damn you Microsoft for costing me more than $3,500 just so I could play FS2004 with all the graphics maxed out.    Sorry I digress... onto the review....  Microsoft is back with their latest edition in their long running series of Flight Simulator titles. There is much to enjoy in A Century of Flight, from piloting the Wright Brothers' Wright Flyer to taking a Boeing 777-400 to London, FS 2004 is sure to please most armchair pilots.  When you start up FS 2004 you'll immediately notice the menus are the same as before, which means they are simple and easy to navigate. There are more missions and options to try out than ever previously offered in Flight Simulator. You can choose to take an old school plane for a spin such as the Wright Flyer (which goes about 40 yards) to a modern Boeing 777. I chose to go with a Boeing 737 taking off at dusk from Dallas Fort Worth.  After FS loads, you will first notice how greatly the graphics have improved.  On my honking PC they were jaw dropping. The lighting, textures, and level of detail shown was amazing. Taxi way lights, markers, and jet bridges got my engines going.   To make my flight more realistic I chose to download the latest weather data, just like in FS 2002. When you get to the 'weather' page a cool new feature appears - weather can automatically update as you fly. No longer must you go to the menu and update it manually (though you can still do this... for those with dialup -- hee hee). Armchair pilots can also choose one of many pre-set weather scenarios.  Severe thunderstorms, blizzards, or fair weather can be chosen for your flight.  I went with the real world weather with auto update.  I climbed into the cockpit... looking around I note that it looks the same as in FS 2002. But when I clicked on the GPS button I got a pleasant surprise -- the addition of Garmin GPS. Microsoft this time around actually put in a real GPS computer. Nice if you're flying a  King Air 350, but a 737? I don't think so. I gritted my teeth and wished for a FMC (Flight Management Computer) which is what real commercial aircraft use to navigate. But alas this is a consumer game.    The Garmin GPS has some nice features, terrain maps, airports closest to your location with detailed information, and lots more. I chose a GPS route from DFW to Oklahoma City (OKC). A nice, short 45 minute flight.   Of course, just like in FS 2002, you can also choose to plan a flight using the pull down menu and have the option of GPS or VOR to VOR navigation.  Nothing changed there...  Before I booted up FS 2004, I looked on the Internet at the real world weather observation from DFW. Winds that evening were from the south (180 degrees) at 10 knots. I downloaded the current conditions into FS and the ~Current Weather Conditions~ menu also said winds were 180 at 10. So far, so good. My 737 then pushed back from the gate.  Now for a quick lesson in flying. When a plane takes off or lands it does this against the surface winds. Why? Without going into detail, taking off and landing against the wind is the real world way of flying.  If you want to know the whole explanation FS has an entire lesson on this. Moving on...  Proceeding to taxi to the north for a south takeoff I watched as CPU controlled planes began taking off in a north bound direction. Huh? I downloaded the current conditions again thinking maybe a wind shift occurred (no weather fronts around though). Sure enough the winds showed 180 degrees. So, I guess I found a bug. I turned around and followed the CPU controlled planes to runway 35 L. This was a letdown for me. For all the impressive things in FS 2004, this hurt the realism effect.     I switched from cockpit view to virtual cockpit. The next cool addition to Flight Simulator 2004 emerges -- switches and controls you can actually play with. Yes kids, you will feel like you're the Captain with all autopilot, flaps, and radio controls clickable with your mouse. Only problem is you cannot view the FMC... I mean GPS in virtual pilot mode. Look for the nice big black hole next to the radios. And where the hell is the ~No Smoking~ or ~Fasten Seat Belts~ button? Oh well.           I waited my turn and took off, once again in awe of the dazzling level of detail which now includes real airline names on the hangars (American and Delta were shown).    Being cleared direct to OKC, I set autopilot and climbed to 21,000 feet. A very cool thing occurred about 10 minutes later. Remember how I set the weather to auto update? Before I took off I checked the real world radar out of Frederick, Oklahoma and noted a severe thunderstorm was west of my flight path, right along the Red River. I knew in the real world I would intercept the storm as it was moving east at 25 mph. Could FS's auto update weather update feature keep up with the real world?  Amazingly the answer is yes.  Just as I got near the Red River a nice flash of lightning came across my view. Then turbulence shook my 737 as I passed the leading edge of the storm. I got through it fine (as did my passengers ), but not without sweating it out for 10 minutes.    This really impressed me.  The level of detail to the clouds, including storm structure and turbulence was very good. Unlike in FS 2002 where storms magically ended at 10,000 feet, FS 2004 gives detailed clouds all the way up to cirrus. This is a very nice addition to FS.    The ATC was very accurate and had me descend while over Ardmore, Oklahoma (just like the real world). I made some turns (right to 360 at Chickasha) and landed to the north at OKC.    Now keep in mind, Oklahoma City airport is no LAX (Los Angeles) in size. But the level of detail for even this medium sized airport was amazing. Taxi lights, markers and even the buildings were all where they should have been. Much improved over FS 2002.    After being impressed with modern aircraft, I decided to try an old school plane. Since it's a Century of Flight, I went with the Wright Flyer which you remember from history class as being the first plane to fly at Kitty Hawk, NC.   It's neato to see this plane in action (let alone fly it). It travels about 40 yards or so and the falls back to the ground. Controls are a bitch so better practice if you want to be good at it or the Smithsonian will have your ass for crashing this piece of history.  I got bored pretty quick with the old school planes. Some of you might like the nostalgic aspect to them, but they are difficult to pilot (no computer aided control for you buzz-boys) and they're like Chinese food -- tastes good initially but leaves you wanting more.   So what else is there to do in FS 2004? Take a spin in one of the cool helicopters.  The FS favorite Bell 206B Jet Ranger makes a return, and a new Robinson R22 Beta 2 training helicopter makes its debut.  It's fun to take one of these for a spin over a scenic area such as Las Vegas or Hawaii. Or you can always use the dependable and easy to operate Cessna, King Air, or Piper which are also good for sightseeing.   So this is the part where I get to tell you whether this is worth your hard-earned $55.  To the aspiring armchair pilot I would say yes. Theres a lot of tutorials and lessons which will help you on your way to piloting that 777. The old school planes will give you some appreciation for how big a bitch it must have been to fly those, compared to modern aircraft.  To the hardcore flight sim buff like myself -- despite the errors I found, FS 2004 is very much worth the money. The weather, graphics, and little details really do make this a giant leap over FS 2002. But Im disappointed that Microsoft didnt include more modern aircraft. A Boeing 767, 757, or an Airbus A-320 would have been very welcomed additions. I know Microsoft wanted to showcase the historic aircraft to appeal to the mass consumer, but I feel they neglected the hardcore fans to some degree. Maybe an add-on pack with modern aircraft is in the works (hint hint).      Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight is a great improvement over its predecessor.  For the novice and advanced pilot its definitely worth picking up.", "date": "Jul 31, 2003"}
