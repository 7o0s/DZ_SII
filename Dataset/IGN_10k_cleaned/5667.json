A year after tearing up Xbox Live and your cellphone bill in Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, Ubisoft's dark heart spy returns in Chaos Theory. Fans of Fisher's previous mobile outings will immediately jam on the ~OK~ key when it comes time to download this new spy caper, as they are undoubtedly ready for more of the superlative action the series delivers -- as well they should. And this sequel doesn't disappoint in that department, but with this third edition, the formula begins to show not necessarily its age -- but its familiarity.   Chaos Theory follows the basic storyline of the console game. A dangerous computer algorithm with the power to crash stock markets and cause epic power outages is poised to wreak havoc on the globe. The programmer has gone missing. Fisher's assignment is to bring in the author of the malicious code as well as bring down the sinister group that wants the program for themselves. It's a good yarn that while not as expertly told as the console version, still makes for a compelling reason to start snapping necks and taking names.   The basic rhythms of the game are present in Chaos Theory. Fisher must use a lethal combination of sneaking, smarts, and brutality to complete his mission, which is stretched across eight levels. Silence and darkness are your key weapons. Fisher's ability to melt into the shadows is a remarkable talent, allowing him to effectively vanish, only to reappear just in time to either escape a guard patrol or pop out a grab some necks.   However, Fisher has some new gear that does offer a few new ways to play the game. The addition of a knife offers new close-combat tactics, as you can now lethally remove a guard with the silence of knocking somebody merely unconsciously. Sam still has guns at his disposal with laser sightings, but for situations where the threat seems like it may overwhelm, grenades prove an effective dispatching technique. They even come with a handy on-screen targeting arc that helps you plot the grenade's trajectory, taking the guesswork out of bloody carnage.   The thing about the new grenades, though, is that you actually rarely find a use for them. Stealthy gamers can play through this adventure just fine with only a knife, pistol, and the ability to use shadows as a weapon. There is a noise meter that tells you when you are being too loud. Noise attracts attention, so you are almost always better off killing them softly. When an alarm is sounded, you receive unwanted visitors. Find a dark spot to disappear into or a corner to stand in silently, though, and the alarm will eventually shut down. Guards will return to their regular patrol duty. Think Metal Gear.   One of the minor evolutions found in Chaos Theory is the multi-plane play field. Fisher can now slip behind screens and walls, effectively doubling the real estate in certain areas. The silhouette art used in these scenes is just plain cool.   It's really hard to find a problem with a game with such incredible presentation and tight play as Chaos Theory. But while playing the game, it's impossible not to see Chaos Theory as a minor progression for the series. It's hard to imagine Fisher boxed-in, but several levels into the game, the feeling is hard to deny. It's just one of those sensations that is hard to put a finger on. When you have a game maker like Gameloft at the helm, arguably one of the best three wireless developers in the world, you expect a little more than minor improvements.   As mentioned, Chaos Theory looks fantastic. There are four different maps. Two of them -- the lighthouse and the Hokkaido House -- have been ripped right from the console game. The other two, the Train Station and Missile Silo, are original compositions for the wireless game. That actually goes a long way toward making Chaos Theory a companion piece to the console game, not just an extension.   Fisher moves smoothly through the highly-detailed levels. There are indeed moments where you may pause in your tracks just to look at everything going on. The backgrounds have movement that really brings them to life. And they are interactive, too. Just ask the poor player that stands on the train tracks for too long.Chaos Theory is an excellent game -- there is no way to dispute that, even if you are a franchise veteran and you do indeed notice that the game provides relatively few new thrills. But the same thrills are thrills nonetheless. I've spent the last few weeks talking about the appeal of games that can be played with a single button. Chaos Theory is definitely not a one-touch game. It's complex, but Gameloft's control scheme and pacing compensate for the limited input of a handset. Gameloft rarely stumbles with their offerings, and Chaos Theory is no exception. When it pops up on your deck, download it. Your may get that familiar feeling, but that's certainly oodles better than that rot-gut anger you feel after downloading a stinker.", "date": "Apr 7, 2005"}
