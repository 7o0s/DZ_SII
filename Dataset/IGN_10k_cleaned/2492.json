Perhaps these people have mistakenly adopted the cynicism they see practiced in the wider world of PC gaming, and decided that the scorn gamers so regularly level at Barbie games and board games should be broadened to include hunting games as well. Well, that's just small-minded. Show me a game of Yahtzee that ends in a bear attack or a Barbie doll that can put a .54 caliber slug into a bear's eye at 200 yards and I'll show you a real game. All of that is simply meant to say that hunting games are fun.  And Hunting Unlimited by Arush Entertainment is certainly more fun than most. It makes a few changes to the basic hunting game model, most of which work. Most significantly, the game makes a point of getting you closer to your prey at the start of each mission. Anyone who's played any of the other hunting games that came out last year will surely remember the frustration of sitting in a blind for ten minutes or following a three-mile trail of deer crap as it winds along a flowing river. Your time to target is significantly reduced here and you'll occasionally find yourself in sight of your prey right at the start.  Now before the purists start blowing their bull calls and throwing fewmets at me, I should say that a good number of the missions still require patience and persistence. And, to be fair, a few of the missions aren't that far from the tediousness of tracking a wounded deer for fifteen minutes through the forest. To further broaden the appeal of the game, all of the missions are available right from the start and can be completed in any order. This gives the game a pretty disjointed or disorganized feel but it's damn nice when you're stuck on a mission to go on to others and come back later.  You can try your hand at hunting five different species. Whitetail Deer, Mule Deer and Elk reside in traditional temperate forests and plains. The Moose and Grizzly Bears tend more towards wintry, mountainous landscapes. In all there is a good range of locations to choose from. Each of the animals has it's own set of about 40 missions, each representing a particular skill, exercise or approach. Sneaking in for a close-in bow shot while your animals are feeding or sniping from hundreds of yards away as your prey bolts across the landscape, there are plenty of different types of hunting to do here.  Lots of secondary animals appear around the landscape -- from foxes to ducks to wolves. You can take out these animals if you like, although this tends to scare the real animals. When you do shoot a target animal, the game tells you which location you've hit, from the non-lethal shots straight on up to the spine and head shots that stop them dead in mid-stride. The locational damage system is mostly used to determine how long an animal can run before dropping but it can also affect their reactions to you.  For the most part, the bears and moose will run at you and the rest of the animals will run away when shot. The AI for the most part is quite good, with animals behaving in a realistic manner. You'll have to make sure you move quietly, behind cover and upwind of the animals if you want to get close.  What did you think of Hunting Unlimited  The ballistics model is fairly tight, although the bow model still has kind of detached feeling to it. Maybe I missed it but I could never seem to see the arrow in flight as so was at a loss as to how to correct my aim. The bullets can pass through animals and into others behind them. It doesn't seem really odd until it happens with the arrows. I once put a single arrow into the head of a grizzly bear and, somehow, it turned into a second arrow and killed the bear behind him. Magic? Probably. Sensible? Not even close.  That said, there are a few ironic limitations to Hunting Unlimited. For one thing, the game's tightly-wound mission setup prohibits any freeform hunting. There's no generic level where you can call your own shots as it were. It would be nice to just jump into an arena and take on whatever the game throws at you. As it is, there're far too few surprises in the missions to keep you interested in coming back for seconds.  I appreciated the inclusion of an overall hunter score, based off of your success in the missions, but there's very little sense of connection among the separate missions. Progress is measured only with generic points that reflect how well you've done in the individual missions. Kill something particularly efficiently or quickly (not the same thing necessarily) and you'll be awarded more points. Frankly, this system is a bit too abstract for my tastes. At the very least the points could have been called dollars. Although since the game picks your default loadout for each mission, there's not really anything to spend your money on. Maybe you could broaden your hunting interest to include ham radio operation or building your own hovercar.  While some view hunting as a social sport, they won't get to mix it up with their friends (virtual or otherwise) in Hunting Unlimited. There's no multiplayer in the game and not even any hunters -- no game wardens even. There are a few cabins here about that you can enter and even a floatplane but the total lack of people should make you feel like your on The Twilight Zone: ~Submitted for your approval, Roy and Earl, two middle-aged corporate VPs who sublimate their own latent homosexuality into the more socially-accepted activity of killing animals, are about to put down stakes and partake in the weenie-roast that is...The Twilight Zone.~  Scary, huh? Yeah, way the hell scarier than a bear. As a reviewer I try to find some fun in everything I play. This means I have to jump back and forth from one mindset to another -- from hardcore submarine simulation enthusiast to Scrabble-loving grandma to gun-toting, conservative naturalist. Secretly that last category is probably closer to the real me than the others.But Hunting Unlimited tries to broaden the appeal of the sport with an accessibility that's sure to attract the less hardcore members of the target audience. You can jump into the game and start accomplishing things right away. As a consequence, it relaxes the realism a bit and puts a few too many restrictions on your choices. Even so, the game is a great diversion for anyone who's into hunting to begin with and might even attract a few non-hunters. In any case, the $20 asking price makes taking the leap a little easier.", "date": "Feb 19, 2002"}
