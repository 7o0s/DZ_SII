Many journalists and gamers alike truly thought those two titles were the bees knees.  So, when Paradise, developed by White Birds Productions and published by Ubisoft, came across my desk, I put away my preconceived notions about Syberia and decided to give this newest title from the mind of Benoit Sokal a fair shake.   Right off the bat, the menu screen put me on edge.  A beautifully drawn and animated Leopard jumps out, growls and generally gives a feeling of spookiness before the action even starts.  The leopard gave me high expectations for the game to come, as I felt a WOW! factor just watching it.  Unfortunately, the menu screen is the most exciting part of Paradise by a mile.     The story starts off as many adventure games tend to.  The protagonist is in a horrible accident and loses her memory.  Who is she?  Why did she come to this war-torn country?  These are questions that we as players already know the answer to, but we have to be taken through the game, our hand held, as the story is nonetheless revealed to us in unsurprising, generally bland chat sequences and somewhat more entertaining, beautifully rendered cutscenes.  Ann Smith (as she is called throughout) has crash-landed in Maurania, a land torn apart by a rebellion and led by a king who has failed his people and become a tyrant.  We know from reading the back of the box and the light manual that she is the daughter of this king and she was headed to visit her father, who has become ill.     After a very impressive cutscene, players are dropped into a room with no direction as to what to do next.  Thankfully, there just aren't many options -- here or any other part of the game -- so a little exploring always yields answers.  I just wish the solutions were actually interesting.  I wouldn't call this much of a puzzle game either.  The few actual puzzles I found were akin to figuring out what a series of buttons did, then pressing them in the right order.  The game's puzzles mainly consist of figuring out what to do next, and it is rarely obvious what that is.  In one instance, I had visited all the locations in the game and seemingly exhausted everything.  Little did I know that I had to revisit a location to activate a cutscene (flowers blossoming) after discovering a recipe.  Of course, had I visited that location last, I might not have realized this was an activated cutscene, but I didn't and it took me a bit of re-exploring every environment to discover that missing bit of info.     The controls, while easy once used for a while, are very confusing at first.  There are no tooltips and the manual is pretty light on information.  Veterans of adventure games will pick it up pretty quickly whereas newcomers might be very frustrated initially.  There are basically very few options - move, interact, pick-up and talk.  The icons will change according to the appropriate actions that can be taken with any object or character.  There are not multiple actions that can be taken with any object in the game, so no worries for right-clicking to find the right action.     Movement is where my biggest complaint about controls comes in.  Here we are, in a beautifully drawn fully 3D environment, but it might as well be 2D for all that means.  In most screens, you can move around the room, but why?  It's unnecessary.  You can zoom in if a look icon appears.  And you can move from screen to screen with arrows.  Throwing a wrench in the system, sometimes there aren't any arrows and you might be left thinking this room or location is a dead end.  But nope, if you click the move icon to move about the area, you might find the screen actually scrolls.  I can count on one hand how many places this occurred in and it is rarely obvious by looking if this might be a location that you can do this in.  All movement is also done by clicking.  One thing I think Paradise could have done easily, because of the way it was set-up, was to offer something new and unique to point-and-click adventures:  keyboard movement in 3D environments.  Add that to my wish list when it makes sense for a game to do so, which in this one, it makes total sense.   One of the heralded features of Paradise is the gameplay with the leopard.  The back of the box even says ~continue the journey as the leopard in real-time 3D.~  Wow is that ever misleading.  There are no objectives to complete with the leopard and I was left at the end of the game wondering why on earth those sequences even existed.  It bothers me that one of the features that actually sounded pretty cool actually has absolutely no point involved with it.  This is one of the many problems that makes Paradise feel so unfinished.  Surely they had plans for the leopard to do *something*?    Graphics range from truly beautiful artwork in the case of the leopard and some of the cutscenes to below average with some of the zoomed out landscapes and artwork on some of the character models in gameplay.  The attention paid to the leopard for cutscenes, for example, is amazing.  That same leopard in the game itself, however, is not so amazing.  It often just looks like a gray shadow shaped somewhat like a leopard.  In one early scene, Ann speaks of the beauty of the Prince's favorite (of his harem).  I wish I could attest to that beauty myself, but alas, the detail on the wife is very low, even in a later scene where we actually see her from her front.  From behind, she looks pretty I guess.      The animation has some oddities as well.  For example, during conversations, the character Ann is often talking to will do a walking loop animation.  This might not be so strange if it weren't for the fact that Ann doesn't move accordingly.  So, Ann is looking straight forward while the other character is doing a loop animation walking various places on the screen.  It just looks wrong.  The low detail graphics can also cause problems when it comes to finding something. In one scene, I know there's a Polopolo bat somewhere on the screen close, but for the life of me, I cannot make it out from the backgrounds.  I had to trust the take icon to show me where it was.  However, controls made this a wee bit difficult because when I would click the take hotspot, it would actually push me into a talk animation with a character on the screen.  I finally did get the bat after several tries, but it is incidents like this that frustrate.   The sound is another mixed bag.  The voice acting is actually really well done, although I'm not sure how much I buy the whole story of her being from Switzerland and Maurania being a country in Africa when everyone sounds like someone from middle America (no discernable accents whatsoever).  I did find the sound effects on the tree-dwellers entertaining -- they used whistles and chirps for speech.  What would have been even more entertaining is if that had been part of a puzzle, where we had to learn pieces of the language to converse.  That was a missed opportunity.  The game is full of those, though.  In another scene, Ann comes across a dead body.  After a brief ~gah!~, it is business as usual.  I would think coming across a dead guy, especially one who was doing you a favor, would elicit more of a reaction than that.  Oh and don't get me started on the drums that you don't hear but everyone else in the game does.  The rest of the sound, outside of some oddities I've mentioned, is well done, if not especially enchanting.   But by far the worst problem with Paradise, one that makes it clear this game was not ready for prime time, is the amount of bugs.  I crashed no less than 10 times.  These aren't kind crashes either.  These are 'the game looks like it is still running but I have to control-alt-del because it has actually frozen' crashes.  I learned after my third crash to save often, as crashes appeared at random times and for no real apparent reasons.  A look-see over the forums at UbiSoft confirmed this is a common problem, and that other folk were getting stuck and unable to finish puzzles all over the place.  Not a pretty sight.   Perhaps it is unfair that White Birds has these expectations put on them, since Microids was the Syberia developer, but highlighting Paradise as 'from the award-winning game creator Benoit Sokal' will do that.  I am going to say, though, the problem with Paradise isn't the story.  The story is more than passable, even verging on interesting.  My final irritation with the game, though, does have to do with the story.  It ends even more abruptly than the first Syberia did.  I'm not sure if they are setting up a sequel.  It is hard to say, because with Syberia, it was very obvious and with this one  I really want to say why bother?  So where does that leave Paradise?  Lacking sorely.  It feels unfinished.  Even the most avid of Syberia fans couldn't be any more than disappointed with Paradise.  Perhaps if it weren't riddled with bugs (which it is), didn't end abruptly (abrupt is too mild a word for the ending) and had more content than inventory puzzles and chat dialogues (sadly it doesn't), Paradise might be more worthy of its name.  As it is, it wouldn't even classify as purgatory.", "date": "May 30, 2006"}
