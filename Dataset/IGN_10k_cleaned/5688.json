Unlike basketball, what with its frenzied action, or football, which has a whole mess of real estate and player to squeeze into an itty-bitty screen, the national pastime's great war between the pitcher and batter has proper pacing for wireless. MFORMA's CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 is solid representation of the sport that has a handful of great features that should satiate a lot baseball fans and earn it more than it's fair share of downloads.   We really enjoyed last year's MFORMA game, and this year offers some improvements, but we cannot help but wish for just a couple more tweaks before Opening Day.   In the negative column -- and let's just get those out of the way first -- the lack of teams is a painful exclusion this late in the game. CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 only has eight teams. The lack of a full MLB license actually exacerbates that shortcoming because it becomes obvious right out of the gate that a lot of local fans will have to throw their hat in with teams they may downright loathe to play. Our other complaint is that CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 takes almost all of the control of defense out of your hands. It would have been nice to run for the ball in outfield ourselves or handle some of the throws, because an error that you aren't directly responsible for just feels like the computer cheated.   However, once you get around those two things, you discover that the focus the developer didn't have to expend on setting up a fielding interface allowed it to concentrate on the batting and pitching. And on that front, CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 is a success. When you pitch, you select from a handful of pitches via a menu -- make your selection by pressing the thumbpad in different direction. Next, you must choose where to put the ball over the plate, and CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 has a neat system. You direct a red dot around the batter's strike zone, but the catch is that when you cannot just set up the dot and throw. The dot keeps moving in the direction you tapped it, so it actually takes a bit of restraint and planning to throw the perfect pitch.   Batting is very streamlined -- you only have a single swing, no power hits -- but it's quite accurate. The animation of the pitcher throwing the ball and it streaking across the plate is paced just right -- you have a chance to actually track the ball and decide if it's something you want to swing at.   As mentioned, fielding is not something you have much control over -- and in a clever move, CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 speeds up this part of the game. The fielders move the ball around the diamond remarkably fast, so you have to really keep your eye on the ball to stay current. This accentuates the split-second decision making of actual baseball players and prevents you from having to wait for the computer to finish all of the defensive maneuvers.   In fact, what this sped-up fielding does is keep the game moving quite briskly. CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 is a game that can truly be enjoyed just a few minutes at a time -- and you get a decent amount of baseball in those bite-sized portions. Thankfully, the game has an auto-save feature that lets you re-join and exhibition or season game exactly where you left off. And those two save files are independent of each other.   CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 has a very nice, clean look to it. The batter-pitcher screen is detailed, giving you sprites big enough that you can really appreciate the excellent animations Gamevil was able to cram in the game. The stadium looks good, too, with lots of color and features, like crowds, lights, and signage. CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 feature three kinds of games -- day, dusk, and night -- each with an individual look to them. Lights come on or are turned off depending on the time of day.   The sound effects are also quite good. The game features an original jingle at the get-go, the sampled sound effects sound good (such as the crack of the bat), and the voice work adds a bit of realism. Very good stuff.CBS Sportsline.com Baseball 2005 may have a few problems that could derail a few players, but the game has a few great features that help turn the tide. The pitching dot that keeps on truckin' is a great addition. The sped-up fielding keeps the game moving for players with limited play sessions. And the batter actually having a fair shake at spotting a bum pitch versus a solid heater is welcome. I still have to put JAMDAT's baseballer at the top of the heap, but this is a firm second place.", "date": "Apr 16, 2005"}
