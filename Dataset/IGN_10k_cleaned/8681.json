Whether speeding down the highway or throwing cars into out-of-control drifts, I-play manages to make each chapter fresh enough to demand a download, even if you have already played the previous entries in the series.   Since there is no theatrical release to adapt, Fast and the Furious: Fugitive seeks to fill in the blanks between the first and second movies. As rogue cop Brian O'Conner, you must speed from Los Angeles to Miami, avoiding the cops and earning enough scratch to survive. It's a good framework for a solid series of races in a variety of locations, such as LA, Sante Fe, and Baton Rouge.   In the right hands, BREW can help developers make a pretty fantastic racing game -- and that's precisely what I-play has accomplished with the 3D edition of Fast and the Furious Fugitive. It's important to note that this review is for the BREW edition of the 3D Fugitive, so Java editions of the phone -- such as, those not found on Verizon Wireless -- have the exact same mechanics, but lack the final level of polish that makes this edition of Fugitive a premiere racing game for mobile.   As you arrive in each new city, you must earn enough cash to make your getaway from the cops before they close in around you. It takes a little more money to escape each town, so you have to hone your wheelman skills as you play. You have the choice to make your cash from straight races or take on side missions, such as delivery, checkpoint races, or crashing into a rival car. While not entirely open world, giving you options definitely adds replay value to Fugitive. Make most of your cash by regular races? On the next play-through, try out all of the side missions.   There are enough events at each city for a few hours of game on just the first try. And once you've completed the game, you can replay areas for kicks. The design of the cities and tracks include enough jumps and shortcuts that you can really explore in later runs outside the main story.   Control is tight. I tested the game on both an LG VX8100 and an VX8600 -- both good handsets but with different keypads. I never had a problem steering, as the game is incredibly responsive. This isn't like Tokyo Drift at all -- your car can negotiate tight turns without having to overdo it on the powersliding. Again, it's a smart move on I-play's part to change up the mechanics so this fourth game in the series feels different and offers new game play. You still have your nitrous bursts for skirting between incoming cars or powering away from cops.   The course design is excellent. As mentioned, there are lots of shortcuts and extra legs for exploration and taking risks. I was concerned that it would sometimes be hard to tell exactly where a corner was, especially in real high-speed chases, but unless you wreck out big-time, you can still get back in the race if you accidentally clip a corner.   Everything comes together so well in Fugitive that I almost want it to escape the smallest screen and be enjoyed by other gamers -- although, I do enjoy having it an exclusive of sorts. Popping a nitrous just as a cop tries to ram you before crossing state lines is a genuine thrill. Scoping out a shortcut and successfully using it to slide ahead of a rival racer is a lot of fun. And Fugitive has many, many moments like this you'll dig on.   The game features a number of story elements, told through small cut-scenes with character portraits. The dialogue is short, sweet, and occasionally clever. The game does the majority of its storytelling through its cinematic feel, such as the sweeping camera movements before a race or as one concludes. I-play says that some of the cinematography was cribbed straight from the movies, such as the pan across car grills just prior to a race.   Visually, the game is fantastic. The car models are just the right size and have plentiful detail without looking muddied up. The reflection work on the car windows is amazing -- the buildings warp around the rear window. Cities are well-constructed in a way that you can see a lot of the environment, but pop-up is limited. The game easily looks better than many PSone racers. It must be mentioned again, though, that many of the flourishes are only going to be found on a BREW (V CAST) handset.  I-play should easily bank another million downloads with Fugitive, which I consider the best entry in the entire series. This 3D edition is a major step up from the 3D edition of last year's Tokyo Drift, thanks to improved controls, a better sense of speed, and amazing visuals. If you're looking for a console-esque racer for your handset, this is as close as we have right now. Fugitive will be one of the games I leave on my personal phone to continue evangelizing the legitimacy of mobile games to non-believers. Highly recommended.", "date": "Jun 23, 2007"}
