You're either the type that digs the partying and the brawling and the wide-open two-wheeled world or you're not. If you're one of the former, you're likely quaffing a brew or six right at this very moment, fondly recollecting that time you cracked the skull of some poor schmuck who accidentally knocked over your Harley outside the local bar. Perhaps you're thinking up new ways to make your muffler-free hawg even more painfully louder than it already is. Or maybe you're just busy bumping tattoos with your old lady.   Okay, so maybe painting all motorcycle riders with the same broad brush is ridiculously old school. But one thing is certain even todayif you're a true biker, you're definitely dreaming about your next cross-country run to see all your buds at the annual rally in Sturgis, South Dakota. It happens but once a year, and to miss it is so very gauche.    To help you through those eleven months a year when a Sturgis get-together isn't on the menu is the latest budget racing title from Activision Value, Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally. If the title in some ways sounds familiar, it should. Back in 1999, WizardWorks, another budget publisher also situated in Minnesota, released a game called Harley-Davidson: Race Across America. A less than spectacular effort even for an entry-level game, Race Across America nevertheless prominently brandished a similar concept, a bushel of Harleys and a Sturgis finish line, and thusly must be considered the obvious Race to the Rally precursor.   You'll begin your Race to the Rally on the west coast in Big Sur, California. Your mission, should you accept it, is to race a bunch of other bikers to the rallying point of Sturgis. Rather than one, continuous, complete journey from Cali to Dakota, the game disposes of all the in-between stuff and instead serves up segregated slices of the American landscape, fifteen in all, each of which will take less than ten minutes to complete.   From Big Sur, you'll roll your Harley through scenic locales such as the Colorado River tourist destination of Laughlin, an Oklahoman hunk of old Route 66, a heartland ghost town, a Floridian waterfront highway, and more than a few mountain passages. Why one would ride from Big Sur to Sturgis through Florida is anyone's guess, but this is gaming as opposed to the real world, so we don't need no damn logic.    To unlock the next segment, you must first finish in the top three riders of the segment that precedes it. And to do that, you must stay ahead of the pack, avoid all the traffic developer Magic Wand Productions has placed in your way, and drive just about as dangerously as you can.   You see, Race to the Rally rewards not only the swiftest, but also the most daring. When you have a chance to drive in the oncoming lane, do it. When you come upon an unsuspecting motorist, ride up as close to him as possible and perhaps even brush up against him. And when you come across a fellow racer, hit the ~kick~ button to unceremoniously boot him from his motor steed and hopefully send him spilling across the pavement, arms and legs hideously akimbo.   Maneuvers like these won't get you to the finish line any faster, but they'll both slow down the competition and score you style points, the latter of which you can then use to purchase mechanical upgrades and the new bikes you'll unlock by finishing in the top three. One little problemthough the game features more than a dozen Harleys, both new and classic, none of the unlockable models are any faster or any more capable than the model you begin with. Indeed, the sidecar-equipped beast you'll unveil for the final run at Sturgis is the most awkward of the bunch.   Moreover, though the retail box PR blurb claims ~1000s of possibilities~ once the game's many motorcycle upgrades are taken into account, the truth is that a stock 2006 FXSTB doesn't feel appreciably different from a fully loaded 1991 FXDB.     That this doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things is an even bigger disappointment. Race to the Rally is far from a difficult gameeven when pumped up to the highest difficulty leveland it doesn't exactly bubble over with complex vehicular physics. It is, in fact, the very definition of ~arcade,~ if arcade is taken literally as a game that fits well in an actual video arcade because it's so danged easy to grasp. The game's central component, the race to the Sturgis rally, can be completed in a leisurely afternoon. That leaves reverse racing and time trials, but most will have seen and experienced all they need to see and experience after just a few sessions. A few helmet-mounted lasers or handlebar rocket-launchers would have helped, but alas, none are forthcoming.       That said, Race to the Rally does have its moments, and it's certainly not the exercise in abject lameness that was Race Across America. Surely the game's most compelling argument is its depiction of speed. For starters, once you kick in your bike's ~boost~ function, you and your reckless racing buds are moving three or four times as quickly as the incidental traffic. But Magic Wand has further enhanced the sensation of rubber-burning fury with a rudimentary but thrilling depiction of motion blur. The faster you go, the more the surrounding scenery degrades into a nearly indiscernible pattern of streaking lights and shapes.    The titillation factor is incrementally heightened during some segments by the sheer proximity of hazards. Street signs, abutments, meridians, cunningly placed jump ramps, and even oil drums are scattered everywhere, often forcing you to squeeze your bike through the slimmest of openings at the fastest of speeds. Imagine pulling a 220-MPH wheelie (long wheelies score big style points) whilst surrounded on every side by motion-blurred cars, drums, oncoming monster semis, various barricades, and more, all seemingly coming within inches of the end of your handlebars as they whiz past. Yet somehow, if you time things just right, you always have just enough space to weasel your way through. Now imagine colossal whooshes of sound and impressive Doppler-affected engine notes accompanying each vehicle you pass. If that's not enough to give even the most jaded racer a death grip on the joystick and a strong desire to do it all again for the same blood-boiling adrenaline rush, nothing is.    Though the game's vehicles are bereft of modern flourishes and more reminiscent of 2000 than 2006, Race to the Rally is not an unattractive game by budget standards. The lighting is good throughout, the glimpses of America are unique from one another and at least partially believableLaughlin, for example, is reshaped slightly for the game but features accurate renderings of several of its casino-hotels and most of the surrounding desert terrainand the roadways vary nicely from wide interstate to mountain pass and dirt road. And the frame rate is good, even with anti-aliasing switched on and when played on PCs that may be a few years old.    Too bad then that the game has some rather annoying perspective issues wherein nearby objects tend to stretch like they're hunks of Play-Doh. It's also too bad that a game with such spectacular crashes doesn't offer bike (or rider) damage. Every time you bite the pavement, you're right back on board again, riding off into the sunset in pristine condition. That none of the many police cruisers or ambulances you'll see rambling about stop to aid or arrest you proves that generic is as generic does.     Perhaps most frustrating is the minimalism of the game's heads-up display. To be fair, it allows you to monitor your speed, your bonus points, your position, and the countdown to the next checkpoint. But it doesn't provide information such as the distance to the finish line or the gap between you and the next guy. And the little overhead map is so permanently zoomed that you can never see more than a fraction of your current course at any one time.    Technically, the Race to the Rally software package is generally strong. The program loads faster than the vast majority of games, and exits instantly. It ALT-TABs quickly and efficiently, though we have on more than one occasion lost communication with our joystick while multitasking. The menus are clean and intuitive and populated with enough options to belie the game's low price point. And if you don't enjoy the publisher's choice of menu musicwhich includes classic biker anthems such as George Thorogood's ~Move It On Over~ and Poison's ~Ride the Wind~then you probably shouldn't be here in the first place.    Given the quality of prior Harley-centric games and its sub-$20 price point, it is surprising that Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally isn't a complete waste of time. Indeed, there are moments when it delivers serious amusement. However, it's clearly a few miles short of a high-end product. It's definitely weak in a number of areas and it certainly won't be a hard drive staple for more than a few days or weeks. At ten bucks, this would be a good bet for arcade thrill-seekers, but at its MSRP, Race to the Rally is a dicey proposition.It's a refugee from the past in more ways than one and it bears many of the typical budget gaming hallmarksmost damningly an extremely short lifespanbut Harley-Davidson: Race to the Rally delivers enough short-term thrills to temporarily appease true motorcycle maniacs.", "date": "Dec 16, 2006"}
