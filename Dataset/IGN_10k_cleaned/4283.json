Since then, the  world has needed an update and players needed more quests, so EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers has arrived to expand the current online world.   Frontiers provides loads of new features for fans of the series, but still has inherent problems that can keep the series from attracting legions of new fans. While the gameplay has become deeper with the additions, the appeal is still for gamers whose taste in RPGs tends towards the slow accumulation of experience towards new skills, abilities, armor, and weapons. It's not for the faint of heart or the impatient, but it can work wonders when strangers get online and go questing together.   Gameplay  In a nutshell, Frontiers is an expansion pack for the original game, EQOA. There's plenty more of everything. More monsters, more quests, more land, a new class, a new race, ten more levels for the characters, and, best of all, a Class Mastery system. More than enough toys for questing veterans.   In EQOA there was only one thing to do with experience; use it towards getting the next level. Where in EQOA the levels maxed out at 50, Frontiers now goes up to 60. In addition to the new levels, experience can be put towards Class Mastery points. These points can be used to buy additional spells in four different categories: General, Class, Class Mastery, and Archetype. In the beginning, most of these spells will be unavailable to even be seen until they're unlocked. Some of these Class Masteries can only be purchased once level 60 has been reached.    While the ten new levels add more to the gaming experience by allowing characters to become ever more powerful, it's the Class Masteries that deliver a much needed depth to the character development. Each new skill must be earned and many of these new spells affect whole groups, allowing players to enhance everyone's ability at once to become more powerful. It is possible to drastically raise the hit points and Armor Class (AC) for yourself or everyone around you. With some spells that are also offensive spells, there are now more options for spells to be used in battle and the typical bashing action can be mixed up a little more.    Beyond the new skills, another 150 square miles of land have been opened up on the new continent of Odus, Lavastorm, the Plane of Sky, and the Great Unknown. The Great Uknown is home to the Ogres, a race that was previously unplayable in EQOA. The Erudite race has moved onto the new continent of Odus and the other lands are stomping grounds for only the most powerful of players.    Another new skill is the trade skill for manufacturing goods. Using a trade skill, it's possible to make your own jewelry, weapons, or armor. In this fashion, unique items can be created by combining different metals in a mold with specific gems that imbue them with attributes like increasing strength or protection from cold. Players can now create their own idea of the perfect weapon or other item. This opens up the number of possible items to massive proportions.      Of course, the appeal is more for those who are willing to fine tune while most players will likely be willing to just buy the results from others and spend more time dungeon crawling. In my own attempts to create a killer item, I made a sword that was weaker than anything I had and I lost an hour of trekking time. With so much time spent in Frontiers doing repetitive tasks, I was content to leave this bit of the game to others. While this addition provides a new way to get a weapon, I was disappointed in the slow process and preferred just finding a new sword on the corpse of an enemy.    The two new additions to the world of EverQuest are the Alchemist class and the Ogre race. I played mostly as an Ogre and everywhere I went, I was two or three times as big as the rest of my group. Other than that, there was little difference in being an Ogre other than how I looked. Strangely enough, the first-person camera on the Ogre is at waist-level. Switching from third-person to first-person would often leave me looking at my Ogre teammates' butts, forcing me to look up to see what they were doing all the time.   One of the main drawbacks to the world of EQOA and Frontiers is the pacing of the action. While the quests are fun to carry out and often provide a reward for their completion, it's the long, hard slogs through beasts for experience that sometimes slows the game down to a crawl. Often there is no more pressing need than to upgrade to the next level in order to be given a new quest.    To get experience, it's best to group up with others and do it together. After that, it's ideal to find a spot where monsters continually spawn and then kill them as soon as they pop up. While this sounds like a great solution, and it is, it can still take hours in one spot to go up a level or two. With so many hours devoted to this very activity, it strongly detracts from the questing and the storylines.    Beyond these slugfests, the massive size of the game's map means several weeks of exploring or looking up websites are required to figure out your way around. While this means that gamers that like to run all over the map will have more ground to cover it's a daunting, and often boring, task for others looking for a faster paced game.   Besides the storylines that vary for each race, the main incentive for pushing forward in Frontiers is all about getting a better character. Most of the people I talked to were more excited about getting the next best weapon or armor or skill and not concerned at all with the story. Only one person I met in all of my adventures cared about people learning the history of EverQuest and he had a couple people heckling him because all they wanted to do was fight and level up.     Even in myself, the biggest appeal in Frontiers was having a badder and badder character. Yes, that's bad meaning good. Seeing other, higher-level characters running around in the same world with better gear pushed me to get more money in order to buy the fancy bronze armor and run around as a bronzed giant. It's even better when lower level players start coming up to you and ask you where you got your gear. It's juvenile, sure, but it was fun and one of the best parts of playing the game.   The Online Experience  While the quests and the slow gaining of experience can be a tedious process, the magic of being online makes it all better. To properly move upwards in Frontiers it's essential to get a complementary group of players. A warrior, a healer, and a couple others can easily combine to form a powerful unit. While I was trekking around the vast expanses of the outside worlds, following a group member who was leading the way, my group and I spent the time making jokes and talking about what we did in the real world. It made the slow passage of time much more fun.     After grouping up with several different folks on different quests, I began to see a lot of familiar names every time I logged on. Pretty soon, if someone I knew was on, I'd call out to him or her if I saw him and chat for a bit. It was like having some basic chat room function behind the rest of the action or, often, non-action. Beyond the desire to upgrade my own character, the idea of finding the same folks and going on another quest with them provided the most incentive to keep playing. After being a lone wolf for the first ten levels or so, I started to add people to my own Buddy List and joined a guild in order to hear people talk and feel more connected. It was often the conversations and comments that livened up the online world rather than the world itself.   Controllers  In playing Frontiers, I tried a variety of input devices in order to get the full experience. Since chatting with other people online is a huge part of the game, I wanted to see all the different approaches. Using the standard PS2 controller, I was able to control my character easily enough, but any communication was a horrible chore. There are a few phrases that can be delivered just by moving the d-pad, but these are fairly limited. Greeting another player or looking for a group can be handled this way, but anything beyond that requires activating a keyboard screen and picking each letter of the message one by one.   Next up on the list was Nyko's iType2 which combines a controller with a tiny keyboard just like the one on the Blackberry device. With each button measuring only a few millimeters across and requiring a fair amount of pressure to push, sending text is a serious thumb workout that causes lots of mistakes and still takes a bit of time. Retailing for $34.99, the iType2 is not worth the extra money because a full keyboard is much easier to use.    Any USB keyboard can plug into the PS2 for typing in messages. While it was a dream to finally be able to type out messages and communicate quickly this still required putting down the controller to pick up the keyboard to type and back and forth and back and forth. Since you can find a keyboard for $20 or so, this is the most economic solution, but a bit more cash will get you to chatting nirvana.   Logitech's Netplay Controller retails for $59.99, double what Frontiers costs, but it is well worth the investment. The Netplay Controller breaks up the regular controller into two pieces and inserts a keyboard in between them. It takes a couple minutes to get used to having the controls so far apart, but the benefits are huge. I was able to quickly type messages as I was running or even during a battle. If you miss the feel of having the controller and keyboard separate, the Netplay Controller can separate into two parts, but there's really no point in doing so. With high-quality Logitech construction and an ingenious design, the Netplay Controller is the clear choice for extended Frontiers sessions.    Graphics  The graphics have been upgraded for Frontiers but that's still not saying a lot. Buildings and hallways are still very blocky and outside environments are filled with plants that look like they have maybe a couple dozen polygons in each. The main improvements have been in the characters who have more polygons and better textures. Since I was going to be seeing a lot of the ogre that I created, it was a pleasure to be able to see him in all his glowering glory.   The spells here are all in the sparkly category as happy little explosions go off with every casting. Don't expect any crazy effects like the ones that fill FFX-2 to bursting. Most of the spells here are more apparent in their effect on the enemy or ally in terms of damage or performance in battle.    It's clear that the graphics have been intentionally subdued in order to make the heart of the game, the questing and the fighting with other people online, flow as smoothly as possible. While fighting in a group with three other people as six others were running around the same area, there was very little lag and it was easy to figure out what was going on at all times. Only when multiple spells were being cast at the same time was there any noticeable lag. So while the graphics won't win any beauty contests, they seem to have been tuned perfectly for the gameplay in Frontiers.   Sound  With hundreds of hours of gameplay and hundreds of square miles to explore, I was expecting to have plenty of music to go along with it, but there's very little here to work with. There are eight different battle songs that are short orchestral scores filled with swells and tension building melodies. It's a classy touch, but it quickly grows old with the scarce number of musical selections. More variety would have been appreciated in order to create a different feeling for different locales. The music itself doesn't change depending on how strong the enemy is or whether the battle is going well or poorly. It's a simple matter of starting the music on cue and ending it when it's over.     The sound effects are fairly limited in Frontiers. Just like the music, the selection of sounds is so small that I heard the exact same sounds millions of times. That's an exaggeration, but the number of different sounds for each character or monster is only one or two.Frontiers has done a brilliant job in updating and expanding upon EQOA. Fans of the original will have little to no excuse in putting off purchasing this title to see all the new features. Master Class, level 60, and 150 square miles of new territory are three huge reasons to check this out. The loads of other new features don't hurt either.For those who are new to EverQuest, Frontiers is harder to recommend. The quests are long and Frontiers is a serious time commitment with hundreds of hours of potential gameplay. A lot of this time is spent on hunting down hundreds of monsters in order to slowly level up and gain new skills and items. One of the biggest appeals is the online community that inhabits Frontiers and if you get involved it could be easy to get hooked on the game. Otherwise, there is little to hold any interest. EQOA was overscored when it was reviewed back in February and even though Frontiers is clearly superior, the same inherent problems of pacing and graphics keep it from appealing to the more casual RPG fan.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
