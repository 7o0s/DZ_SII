The Vis Interactive developed 3D platformer, based on Shiny's popular 16-bit worm mascot, has undergone thousands of redesigns during the course of man's evolution. Now, on the brink of the 21st century, with electricity popularized and the magic of ~television~ in millions of homes, the Scottish developer has finally wrapped up production on the game and publisher Rockstar Games has readied it for your enjoyment.  The good news for Nintendo 64 platform fans is that, unlike so many oft-delayed games that teeter on the edge of becoming vaporware, Jim has arrived in relatively good form with only a few drawbacks for the nitpickers -- us -- to complain about.  The Facts  3D platformer Single-player Several huge worlds to explore inside Jim's mind Off-the-wall cast of characters More than 15 hilarious weapons and item pick-ups Humorous 3D environments and level themes First N64 to offer smell options   Story It's fairly standard stuff, really. One day while doing whatever it is that he does, Earthworm Jim is hit by a flying cow. This sends the superhero into a crazed coma. Jim awakens inside of his own mind to find, of course, that he has gone insane. The only way for the zany character to restore sanity to his own mind, it seems, is to ~seek out the golden udders of lucidity that lie deep within his cow struck cranium.~ Make sense? Good. It's not supposed to. That said, the wacky background story for the game is the perfect indication of things to come. By the way, we realize that we've used the words 'zany' and 'wacky' in the same paragraph and damn it, we just don't care. We're kooky like that.  Gameplay In order to make you fully understand the gaming experience that is Earthworm Jim 3D, we're going to reach deep into our grand bag of cliche videogame review phrases for the terminology needed. Non-meanings such as ~tried-and-true,~ and ~standard mechanics,~ come to mind right off the bat, but let us dig even further. Perhaps nauseating press-release ready quotes like, ~Earthworm Jim 3D brings the classic 2D formula of the franchise screaming into the third dimension,~ work better. Regardless of how we word it, though, all of the above is absolutely true. Earthworm Jim 3D plays exactly like its predecessors -- only in 3D. Go figure.  You might be wondering what, exactly, the point of the game is? Damn fine question. We're glad you asked it. Put simply, Jim must travel through each different world the title offers recovering his lost marbles (a delightful double-meaning to be sure) and seeking out golden udders. Through all of this, the worm will also fight dozens and dozens of enemies, solve puzzles, square off with bosses -- you know, the usual stuff.  Jim, our superhero, superego worm main character, is capable of everything from whipping the tail of his head out at enemies to firing off a wide arsenal of damaging weapons. The charismatic dirt-dweller can jump, crouch, climb, hang, roll, run, sneak, etc. -- he's got all of the moves associated with and expected of platformers plus more. Jim can helicopter hover in the air with the use of his head and he can super-jump by pressing a combination of buttons.   Control is surprisingly tight and intuitive. Jim is manipulated with the analog stick. He's a fast little worm, he is, moving effortlessly along with no sense of sluggishness whatsoever. A jumps, B crouches, C-Down head whips and Z-trigger shoots whatever weapon our mud-eating main character happens to be carrying at the time. It's simple. It's easy. It works just fine. Meanwhile, the remaining C-buttons serve to rotate the horrendous camera system (which we'll hammer on in due time) and the R button, like so many platformers before it, swings the ungodly viewpoint behind Jim's back -- in theory.  Levels are separated into portions of Jim's decaying mind. We've got four major worlds to contend with, including the likes of Memories, Happiness, Fear and Fantasy. They're all self-explanatory. Each world features its own sick brand of humor (which we quite like) and an accompanying cast of downright weird characters. The game has everything from Disco Zombies to classic updates to favorites Professor Monkey for a Head and the always desirable Evil the Cat.  Each world (or sub-level) has a series of tasks that must be accomplished, many of which make no particular sense. For example, Jim may be required to launch a group of space-bound refrigerators into the sky and then battle giant walking chickens and water-skipping pigs. We don't suggest trying to comprehend the thought process behind the game's design. Simply accept what you see and move on. None of the goals are terribly difficult, nor are the puzzles. Think dodging bullets and firing away at enemies. Think blowing away crates for secret goodies. Think devising ways past quicksand. Think fighting big bosses while riding pigs. Now stop thinking or you may hurt yourself. It all comes together well enough; everything feels tight, puzzles are fun, level design unique and humorous -- and yet, Earthworm Jim 3D has one major problem that's so damn frustrating that it works overtime to smear all of the game's strong points...  Graphics ... The camera system.  Following is a diary of IGN64's first encounter with the final version of Earthworm Jim 3D for N64:   Five minutes of play: Wow. This game looks much better than we had originally thought it would. Wonderful texture design. Crisp, clear levels, lots of color, brilliantly conceived characters. It's a bit shocking, really. Who would've thought Jim could come alive so nicely in 3D?  10 minutes of play: Excellent lighting effects. When Jim fires his guns, the immediate area reflects this with a chance of brightness. Very pretty. The camera system is a bit of a loose cannon. Probably nothing to worry about.  15 minutes of play: Hardly any slowdown. Lots of variation in environments. Each area has its own unique look. It's a bit difficult to manage the right angle in certain areas. The camera always seems to be too close to the action. Perhaps Vis did this to keep a smooth framerate?   20 minutes of play: Characters feature solid animation for the most part. Jim's roll effect leaves a bit to be desired, but otherwise we've no complaints. However, something must be done about the camera system. It's really beginning to weigh onto the whole experience.  30 minutes of play: Game looks great. Camera system is awful. We've tried forcing it behind Jim's back using the R button, but this doesn't work all of the time and even when it does, it's still far too close to the character to give us a full view of the 3D environments we are exploring. Highly annoying.   While the game's camera system is not so damaging that it ruins Earthworm Jim 3D, it definitely puts a noticeable dent in the title. Viewpoint issues aside, though, we've got very few complaints in regards to what Vis Interactive has achieved visually for this 3D update to the Jim franchise.  Sound The game opens to reveal Jim hopping along madly from foot to foot while playing the accordion. The music, probably not everybody's favorite style, is still of excellent quality and sounds great. This off-the-wall theme continues throughout the game, which never plays the standard selection of techno tunes that are slapped down in every N64 game nowadays (Neil Voss' music excluded, of course). Sound effects are equally humorous, offering various degrees of Jim screaming, psychotic animal noises, bops, bangs, screeches, moos -- whatever.  I'm very surprised by what developer Vis Interactive has ultimately accomplished with this 3D update to the Earthworm Jim franchise. It wasn't so long ago that I pegged the game for vaporware and this is one time that I'm very happy to be wrong. What do we really have here? A solid 3D platformer that plays good, looks good and dishes out a good selection of levels, characters and weapons to keep gamers happy and interested. With that said, though, EWJ 3D isn't a groundbreaking platformer; it doesn't offer us anything we haven't seen before. It doesn't play any better than, say, Banjo-Kazooie, nor is it any prettier. More damaging than the fact that the game isn't going to be remembered as one of N64's most innovative, though, is its flawed camera system. It's very frustrating to come to grips with this sucker and only the most dedicated platform enthusiasts will stick with it for any extended period of time.Still, if you're okay with the fact that EW Jim 3D isn't a pioneering effort by Vis Interactive and you don't mind wrestling with the camera system now and again, this game definitely comes recommended. Bearing all drawbacks in mind, this is still a solid update to the popular franchise that is, if nothing else, definitely worth renting.", "date": "Oct 26, 1999"}
