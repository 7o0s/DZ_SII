The first two games appeared on last generation's cartridge-based console and while they were both admittedly ambitious -- filled with style, energy and powered by a unique take on the futuristic racer, they were scarred by sloppy execution.   But with the PS2 port of XG3 Extreme G Racing to GameCube, UK development studio Acclaim Cheltenham has created a racing beast that is anything but shoddy. Indeed, the game's unparalleled sense of speed, tight control, jaw-dropping track design and beautiful graphics combine for an end experience that easily rivals that of the Wipeout or F-Zero brands. Players everywhere, take notice.  The Facts  Extreme-style, futuristic racing takes place on magnetic bikes that can accelerate to mach speeds Runs on new 3D engine built from the ground up for next-generation systems Several modes of gameplay including arcade, championship, cooperative mode and more All new GameCube multiplayer mode allows for three- and four-player split-screen action Experience more than 12 bikes over 10 different circuits Power-up with a huge assortment of explosive weapons and bike upgrades Graphical extras such as real-time lighting, a huge draw distance, and a quick 60 frames per second for added sense of speed Unpredictable courses complete with twisting tracks, loops and drop-offs Turbo boosts send bikes zooming past the sound barrier In-game techno soundtrack by the Ministry of Sound   Gameplay Welcome to the 23rd century, where the sport of racing has taken on a whole new life. The Extreme G Racing League pits high-speed, magnetically powered bikes and their riders across spiraling, gigantic roads that stretch up and down. The bikes themselves can go fast enough to rip through the sound barrier with upgraded engines and turbo boosts and are protected from enemy weapons by energy shields. Nobody is safe from bullet fire, bombs or missiles, and if riders aren't careful they may find themselves zooming off a course edge to their deaths below. It's brutal. It's frantic. It's awesome.  XG3 delivers players a number of gameplay areas including the self-explanatory practice, arcade and time trials, but the meat and bones of the title is its Career Mode. Here gamers choose from one of six teams, select a rider and enter into a competitive league. The idea behind the leagues is to race through courses, win and earn cash, whereby the bikes can be upgraded in speed and weaponry to compete in the next set of events. Each league (except the last one) is constructed of three different tracks that become increasingly more unpredictable and consequently difficult as gamers advance.  Control is extremely tight, polished, and the standard setup works quite brilliantly with the GameCube pad. Bikes are manipulated with the analog stick, A accelerates, B offers a backward view, Y shoots projectiles and X functions as a turbo boost. Weapons are selected with the D-Pad, which takes a bit of getting used to, but it's never more than a minor bother. Meanwhile, the L and R shoulder buttons are used for controlled left and right braking, which is integral to making some sharp turns. The control configuration is made all the more intuitive on the GameCube controller. This just happens to be one of those games that feels much better on Nintendo's pad than it does Sony's.  There is a certain depth to the control scheme that isn't immediately recognizable to the novice player, but which should make itself evident to the experienced one. Gamers must learn to use the R and L buttons around certain corners so that their bike doesn't crash into the walls. They must learn to conserve turbo boosts for when they really need the extras pushes. They must know when it's proper to break the sound barrier -- usually on a straightaway or loop -- and when it's best to use caution. And there are other invisible intricacies too. For example, when going up a huge hill, if one presses back on the analog stick they will go faster. Similarly, when going downward, pressing forward on the analog stick results in increased speed. Those that invest enough time into the game will undoubtedly learn these enhancing extras, and those who don't will still have fun.   Interestingly, developer Acclaim Cheltenham has increased the weight of bikes for the GCN version of XG3 so that they feel heavier and handle more naturally, which comes as a welcome surprise and a plus as it bodes very well for the play experience.   Gamers have at their disposal a wide variety of bike weaponry that can be used to blast opponents out of a race. While there is everything from heat-seeking missiles to bombs and standard gunfire, in our experience the weapons are much more of an afterthought to the racing elements. It's entirely possible to beat the game without ever shooting a single bullet, but the arsenal is an option for those that wish it.  XG3 is all about speed. It is probably the fastest racer ever created, blowing by even F-Zero and Wipeout in this respect. There are several different classes of bikes that offer different degrees of speed from 250-G to 1000-G. The first time players race they will be impressed with the sense of speed achieved as amazingly, even the initial bike in the game blazes. It rips around corners, barrels down straightaways and has no trouble going up hills. But going back to the first course with a 1000-G vehicle can be simply awe-inspiring as what appeared to be fast before all of a sudden seems slow by comparison. At some points, in fact, the game moves almost too fast, which makes it very difficult to maneuver through corners without hitting walls. But practice makes perfect and skilled players will find that even the sharpest turn can be successfully manipulated with time and effort -- and frustration.  There are 10 tracks (counting the final) in the game and each is a huge, beautiful thing built around speed. Tracks twist, turn, loop, roll, rise forever into the sky and dip below the earth into caves and sea. There are also branching paths that crisscross with one another and unexpected drops and jumps that lead to ledges or death beyond. Each course, with the exception of the first, is like a different roller coaster. Brilliant design for sure and exceptionally varied in form with each track. The only problem is the first nine courses are easily zipped through in Career Mode, and the tenth -- less twisty and gravity-defying than some of the others -- is somewhat anti-climactic. The game's overall length falls a little short for our tastes, which is really what keeps it from earning a higher score.  An exclusive addition to the GameCube version of XG3 is an enhanced multiplayer mode that allows for competitive matches with up to four players. There is also a two-player Team Mode in which two people can race cooperatively against computer-controlled enemies in league environments. In either mode the control remains tight, AI competitive (if applicable) and the framerate solid. Players can customize which bikes, weapons and tracks they'd prefer and the action begins -- simple, effective, intuitive, and easily recommended.  Graphics Former members of the Wipeout teams have joined up with Acclaim's Cheltenham house, which explains why XG3 resembles the Sony racer at points. True enough, gamers race bikes and not hovercrafts, but the track layouts are similarly inspired, often dark and illuminated with neon, and totally futuristic. Course roads, wide and detailed, are often rimmed with yellow and black markers, and surrounded by stylized signage with intentionally vague drawings. Huge, sprawling architecture fills the backgrounds -- in some levels giant skyscrapers raise into the sky and in others ocean waves shimmer at the bottom of a drop-off. The scope is always immense to the point where players really feel like they're racing through a grand futuristic city or over a mountainous region.    One of our favorite tracks, Megalopis 7, seems right out of the movie Blade Runner. Players race through this dark, gigantic city with high-rise buildings and cars that fly by overhead. The skyscrapers in the background feature fairly crisp texture work, real-time lights above illuminate the roadway, and everything moves at an amazing pace. Another area, Atradaitoshi, boasts a similarly neon city look, but with a huge rainstorm above. As players progress the track, huge water droplets splatter the camera and it looks very realistic. Other courses still, like Siris Canyon, take gamers through a sprawling desert environment complete with drops into caves and Oceania, into the depths of a sea below. It's all beautifully varied.     The bikes themselves are well-modeled and full of detail, and brought to life with some decent animation that shows off their sharp turning abilities, not to mention front and rear hydraulics. Beyond everything else, there are some fairly impressive particle effects with weapons and explosions, some top map lighting too. The framerate runs at 60 through most of these levels, with the occasional drop to 30 in environments with rain and too many vehicles on-screen at once. Overall though, it's quite a beautiful racer. However, we were somewhat disappointed to learn that the game doesn't support progressive scan mode.  Sound The audio portion of XG3 is fitting, whether one likes it or not. A techno soundtrack composed by the Ministry of Sound accompanies the futuristic game and it works very well. Some of the tunes are downright catchy and go perfectly with the intense, speedy pace of the title while others come off as somewhat generic compared to the more eclectic soundtracks on the market. It's a matter of taste here, of course, and surely this will differ drastically. Our own tastes had us loving some of the mixes and hoping for something a little more experimental -- Aphex Twin-like perhaps? -- with others. Regardless, though, it's still one of the better musical experiences to be had on any next-generation console so far.  Effects-wise, there really needn't be any debates as XG3 gets the job done beautifully. A healthy selection of engine sounds and turbo boost noises goes a long ways to adequately conveying the sense of speed the game dishes out. There are different effects for different weapons, from standard gunfire to missiles and more, all of which sound great. And the simple noise that goes hand-in-hand with breaking the sound barrier -- an echo and then silence -- is satisfying beyond description. Hook this baby up to a Dolby Pro Logic II-capable receiver and listen in awe as structures zoom by, gunfire echoes, and ships bust around corners in fully simulated 5.1 sound with front and rear separation. All in all, very impressive indeed.XG3 for GameCube is quite honestly one of my favorite racing games of all time. It's got newly polished, tight vehicle control, wonderfully designed tracks that seem to go in every direction, and an unblemished sense of speed that surpasses everything else out there. Plus, it's a fairly beautiful game to boot -- one that runs mostly at 60 frames per second, and the techno soundtrack is fitting, if not a little repetitive. My biggest gripe with the game is that it's a little too short for my liking. 10 tracks, nine of which are easily zipped through, will not be enough for some hardcore racing fans. There's no denying that. But to its credit, XG3 does feature a fun multiplayer mode -- a four-player one for GameCube, which does a lot to extend the replay value of the title. Everything else -- a career mode that lacks character depth and a weapons system that feels almost secondary, falls in the minor issues department.Still -- short or not, this is one hell of a great racer while it lasts and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend as a must buy for any fan of high-intensity games, or of racing titles in general. In the past I have always felt that there was either F-Zero or Wipeout. Now I look forward to the next installment of the Extreme G franchise just as much. Nice job to Acclaim Cheltenham.", "date": "Nov 28, 2001"}
