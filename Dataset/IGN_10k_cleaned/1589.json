Not that I necessarily mind his disappearance, although Sajak was one of the better latter-day game show hosts, but I'm curious, now that it seems as if Vanna White is the sole face of Wheel of Fortune.  That's at least as far as the game is concerned, Hasbro Interactive's Wheel of Fortune 2nd Edition.  Other questions arise in the course of playing a game like this.  For example, why do we need a second Wheel of Fortune game on the PlayStation?  I suppose devoted Wheel of Fortune fans might have run out of puzzles in the interim, or perhaps they absolutely had to have a brand-new set of quiz-show-host FMV soundbites.  For whatever reason, 2nd Edition is here.  Gameplay  Wheel of Fortune is a show that's better suited to game adaptation than some (witness the disaster that is Family Feud), although it's still more unwieldy than something like a traditional quiz show.  As you'd expect, the game progresses just like the show, as you spin, buy vowels, guess at the puzzles, and hopefully win thousands of dollars, fabulous prizes, and so forth.  The special conditions for late games and the bonus round are also intact (as well as the progressively more valuable spaces on the board), and they're tweaked a little to make them more friendly in the game context.  For example, the time limit to guess the answer in the final round is suspended a bit to take into account the fact that you have to type the whole thing in with the little keyboard GUI.  The single-player game is filled with the inevitable downtime.  Miss your turn due to thickheadedness or an unlucky spin and it takes a while to work through the other two players' turns.  It helps to play this game while you have something else to occupy your time with - I found it a decent enough distraction in between bouts of real work.  In multiplayer games, the interface is smooth, and the game doesn't waste too much time inflicting Vanna on you.  If you're all alone, though, you can always try the test mode, wherein (a la Jeopardy) you can take the test given to prospective Wheel contestants, which is fun in an ~if only~ sort of way.  Graphics  Speaking of Vanna, her FMV sequences make up most of what there is to look at in this game.  It makes more of an effort than Family Feud did, though, with a better-looking 3D set (the Wheel is suitably impressive) and more special options for you to choose.  For each game, you can pick one of the goofy themed Wheel of Fortune sets, like Las Vegas or what-have-you, which provides just a little bit of a change in between sessions against the Wheel.  Sound  Da da da da, da da da da da da, da da da da da da, da da daaaaaaaa...  Yep, the proper Wheel of Fortune theme is in the game, along with plenty of sound effects and voices.  Vanna speaks with the assured tones of a professional host, but perhaps the voices for the computer contestants are too realistic - they're really, really aggravating after a little while.  At least there aren't many of those sorts who scream ~big money!~ over and over during every spin of the wheel, though.It's Wheel of Fortune, folks.  Sorry if I can't muster a whole heck of a lot of enthusiasm.  But if you can't get enough Wheel, and I recognize that the demand does exist out there, this is a decent dose of Wheel for your money, with over 2500 puzzles and different multiplayer modes to keep things interesting.  True die-hards (my mother, for example) might also enjoy the little backstage snippets included in the options section.  So get to spinning, especially considering how cheap this one's liable to be.", "date": "Dec 5, 2000"}
