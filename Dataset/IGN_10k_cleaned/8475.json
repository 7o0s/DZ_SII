It's a tragic paradigm-shift that kicked off in the mid nineties and has seen the mainstream gaming market embrace 3D completely. Some game companies still do 2D sidescrollers - Alien Hominid being a recent success story, and SNK's Metal Slug series is another. Finally, a series that has charmed bloodthirsty old-school platforming action fans for a decade has made the jump to Wii. Does it offer enough to keep 2D action games kicking a little longer?   In this anthology, SNK has compiled 8 Metal Slug titles, thrown in some galleries and unlockables and slapped a relatively discounted price on the cover. In the age of Xbox Live Arcade and the Wii's Virtual Console, this might seem kind of pointless - and to some degree it is. If you've already played the series to bits, only one new addition is really worth your time - the sought after Metal Slug 6.   If you've never pumped a few dollars into the arcade iterations of any of the Metal Slug games, the premise is simple. If it moves, shoot it. If it's stationary, you should probably shoot it, too. Really, the only time you shouldn't be mashing the attack button is when you've paused the game - presumably to give your thumb a break.    The action is clearly continuous, scrolling vertically and horizontally. SNK's art department has injected incredible personality into the animations - characters are brilliantly reactive to being ventilated, burnt, crushed and sliced in twain. At any one time, there may be dozens of enemy soldiers, tentacled alien monstrosities, dive-bombing planes, massive tanks and swarms of hostile critters waiting to do you in.    Awesome. Who can resist a spot of airborne chaos?  Thankfully, you also have an arsenal of cool weapons with which to lay waste - heavy machine guns, laser canons, missile launchers, flamethrowers, bizarre alien technology and more. Of course, all of this neglects the namesake of the series - the Slugs, or mobile attack units. Choose your flavour; there are the obligatory tanks and cars, all outfitted with beefy artillery, turret-mounted camels, submersibles, Harrier-style jets and outlandish mech-style creations. Not all are practical, but they're fun distractions that will get you through most scripted boss encounters.   Levels are consistently paced to the point of predictability - it's not a flaw by any stretch, however. There is a kind of frequency or regularity to major boss encounters, mid-level sub-bosses and platforming sections that gives each level a familiar feel, despite outstanding character and encounter design. But that is Metal Slug for you - it's nothing if not consistent and unapologetic.    The Wii version adds a motion-control gimmick to the scheme. We'll wager you'll try it for between two and five minutes, take a heaving sigh and switch back to a more traditional and usable configuration. Flicking the remote for grenades, or using the remote like a joystick (held vertically) might seem like a fun integration, but the result just doesn't offer the precision to be a practical or viable choice. It's nice, however, that the developer opted to give players half a dozen different remote/nunchuk/Gamecube controller combinations. A little experimentation left us feeling that the game really would've benefited from Classic Controller support, as unfortunately there is no option. If you own a Gamecube controller, that's your best choice, followed by a horizontally-held remote.   Still screenshots hardly do Metal Slug Anthology justice. Even the original, now ten years old, still looks respectable - and certainly wouldn't be out of place on DS or PSP (hence, the PSP port,which is also available). That aside, there is no 480p support to be found, which is a shame. But the game still looks plenty sharp and keeps a mainly consistent framerate in 576i. It's not going to impress your mates (well, outside of some beer-fuelled nostalgia, perhaps), but it's definitely an eye-catching game. By 5 and 6, the pixilation has been reduced and the animations refined even further to the point where you'll wonder why more developers haven't gone back to their 2D roots for a few kicks. Of course, then you look at some of the titles on Xbox Live Arcade and realise that this is exactly what is happening. 2D has been relegated to the bargain-bin.   ...or flaming, burning chaos. Sure, it's old, but age shall not weary them. Particularly when they're on fire.  Of course, for all the artistic technique on display in the main game, little thought has gone into the menus and overall presentation, which is universally bland and occasionally confusing. The load screen is simply a small tank drifting left-to-right across the base of the screen. The treads aren't even moving, for crying out loud. Surely, it's not that hard to add a bit of spit-shine to a 10th anniversary edition of a classic arcade series. The less said about the music, the better - it's your typical bombastic midi; not atrocious but definitely 'high-energy' rather than high-brow. So, in a way, it's a lot like the game series - all balls-to-the-wall action, all the time. It's 'classic', but that's not necessarily always a good thing.   Two-player mode is where Metal Slug really shines. Playing with a friend almost universally makes games better, and this is no exception. Grab a second controller or remote and have at it. Again - it doesn't take the most powerful hardware in existence to provide this kind of social, satisfying and compelling gameplay. Metal Slug Anthology is arguably a working model of Nintendo's gameplay-over-graphics strategy.   As the series matures, you can see where the development team has injected fresh characters, new vehicles and recurring enemies to keep gamers hooked. It's a very evolutionary series of games, and if you're not into run-and-gun, none of the sequels, unlockables or otherwise are going to shift your stance. As side-scrolling shooters go, very few other series come close to combining this level of artistry with compelling gameplay. Metal Slug 3, arguably the pinnacle of the series, was actually released to retail on its own a couple of years back; that you can get this, plus a host of other titles for a smaller price make this a sound purchase for Wii-owning arcade freaks and those who have a weak spot for slicing and dicing sprites.", "date": "May 16, 2007"}
