The smell of the peanuts, the taste of the hot dogs, and the sounds of exuberant fans are some of the most heartfelt signs of Summer. Late-inning games on a Sunday afternoon, the suicide squeeze, a sac-fly to left field, a scorching double down the right field line; all of these exciting and not so exciting aspects of the game of baseball are what makes the contest great. Baseball is in and of itself, a thousand games inside of one. Poetry in motion. An athletic work of art.  So you could only imagine that when Sega Sports first announced a return to their classic diamond series with the Dreamcast release of World Series Baseball 2K1, that the passion I had for my favorite sport grew that much larger. An all-time favorite serial of mine, easily on par with the computer incarnations of Accolade's Hardball chain, WSB's move to the 128-bit universe had me more anxious than I'd like to admit. One of the saddest days in my recent professional memory however, has to be the day I realized that the newest addition to the WSB family was the weak link in a line of excellent ball games.  What went wrong? Up to this point, Sega Sports had managed to put together an excellent streak of quality titles. NFL 2K, NBA 2K, and to a lesser extent, NHL 2K were all fabulous recreations of the sports they attempted to emulate. Over the top graphics, superb audio commentary, and buckets of individual nuances unique to its respective game were the building blocks of this awesome lineup. The trouble with World Series Baseball 2K1 lies not solely with any one problem, but a collection of problems that add up to one disappointing experience.  First we have the options, or rather what could have been. Although you can choose to play an exhibition match, a preset quick-start game, or an entire season (that allows you to set the length of the year, all the way up to the standard 162 games), other situational bonuses are sorely missing. Where's the promised Home Run Derby? What about scenarios and recreations of famous games throughout history? Most baffling is the inclusion of post-season play right there on the menu. What incentive does a consumer have to play an entire season when he can jump right into the October marathon from the get go?  On the plus side, Sega has included an excellent customization mode. With it, you can create your very own player from scratch and edit him all the way down to the type of socks that he wears. Even better is the ability to choose his batting stance, of which there are many. Impersonating your favorite diamond hero, or grabbing a standard move straight out of the books is as easy as a few simple button presses.  Also cool is the team edit feature, which allows you to build your very own franchise from the ground up.  You can choose the city, league, and starting line-up for the dream team of your choice. Should you ever want to keep up with all the trades and transactions that go on in the real world of baseball, this little extra will let you do it.  What really shaves the llama however is the complete lack of a transaction structure. There is no CPU-initiated trade system, as everything that goes on in the league must be controlled by you. While some people may like the idea of having all the teams keep the same roster all year long, the option to make a trade with a computer opponent shouldn't be so half-assed. What's to stop someone from trading Mark McGwire for Walt Weiss anyway? It would have been so much cooler if the programmers had implemented an in-season transaction feature that could offer and decline deals from not only the human player's team, but other CPU teams as well.  Another bummer would have to be the lack of either a farm system or empty slots on existing rosters. Should you ever want to put together two-for-three player deals if you do decide to handle all the league's transactions, you'll be out of luck, as players must be swapped directly for one another. Furthermore, should you want to import one of your creations onto a team, you MUST do so by trading an existing player off of your team and adding the Frankenstein into the spot the old player used to occupy. Would it really have been that hard to give a team an extra space or two? A good idea not realized to its full potential.  Further baffling has to be the fact that you can't set your own lineups prior to a game. Choosing the order of your men, their positions, and creating a set pitching rotation is completely out of the question. Instead, you have to reset everything before each game, waiting until the matchup has actually started before you can swap positions. And why are there no player injuries?  On a positve note, and on a similar level with Sega Sports other franchise attempts, World Series Baseball 2K1 certainly knows how to act like a baseball game. As soon as the contest starts, you are treated to an accurate aerial view of the home team's stadium while the National anthem blares in the background. True to the real-life experience of The Star Spangled Banner, the song will sometimes be played as an instrumental or sung word for word by either male and female artists.  As the camera zooms onto the field before the end of the anthem, you are treated to a display of both teams lined up side by side in various poses listening to the medley on the loud speakers. Some players lower their head, others hold their hand on their hearts in the pledge of allegiance, and further players will just rest their arms behind their back waiting for the song to end. One of the best experiences the game can yield, the intro is truly dynamite.  Other little extras like pitcher profiles when they take the mound, running totals for a batters statistics at the bottom of the screen ala ESPN, and fluxuating game times (day games, night games, and even dusk games) all add to the feeling that you're participating in real baseball. The only justifiable beef I had was that the statistical numbers for the game itself weren't provided in the player listings when they stepped up to the plate (or in the box score afterward). Other than a catalog of home runs that were hit, tracking what was done in an individual game is next to impossible without a pen and paper.  Graphically, WSB 2K1 is a bag of trail mix. The stadiums are magnificently rendered and look exactly like their real world counterparts. Grass patterns, advertising signage, and a myriad of other little details that make each arena famous are all recreated to the tiniest degree. From behind the batter's perspective when he first steps into the box however, you can clearly see the most obvious graphical problem; the fans. Two-frame amoebas, the choppy audience seems out of place when settled against the clean polygon backgrounds. And once a ball has been hit towards the outfield they get even worse. The two-dimensional rice paper mob of fandom turns ugly as you can see the seats they're supposedly sitting on beneath them, while barely making out the straight line of orange ~people~ populated within. The accomplished look is akin to the entire town of South Park invading the stadium of your choice to take in a game for the afternoon.  As for the players themselves, their motion capture is brilliant. Be it Ken Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds, or the unmistakable swing of Mark McGwire, each teamster looks and reacts just like the real thing. Their faces too have been mapped onto the figures, smiling like goobers and adding a lot to the illusion that you're playing with big leaguers. Even more impressive are the sliding and catching maneuvers that seem to be taken straight out of last night's sports highlights. Basket catches, diving grabs, and powerful charging slides only scratch the surface of what you can find. Sega Sports definitely knows how to make a character model look real. We could have used some more camera angles though.  Unfortunately, there's more slowdown than necessary whenever there's any type of movement in the infield. Stealing a base or making a play at home plate immediately grinds the action to a near-halt. Slowly but surely you are forced to watch your characters tortoise their way to the base of their choice at a whopping five frames per second. Also on the annoying front has to be the strange clip in animation during the pause between pitches during an at bat. One second you're in full stride, looking good and ready to swing for the fence, and the next you're privy to a quick flash of garbled polygons and the reposition of your batter in his original stance. Strange.  Whereas past incarnations of World Series Baseball had a shining light in the aural department, this first version on Dreamcast has gone straight to the gutter. Contact noises and catches in the mitt are almost the exact same sound, and other goodies like grunts, groans, and dirt slides are few and far between. When you do manage to hear them, the level of quality is so low you'd swear these are sampled wave files from the Genesis cart days.  Luckily, the musical arrangements in the menus and during the games themselves sound pretty good, but music isn't exactly the most important matter when trying to capture the sounds of baseball. If only the same effort that was taken in producing the score was applied to the main sound effects, things could have been a lot better. Why does the crowd of 30,000 fans sound more like 8 bowling maniacs at the Wonder Pin on a Tuesday night?  Worst of all though, would have to be the commentary. Short, shallow, and often inaccurate the buggy voice-over from a Bob Ueker sound-alike really disappoints. Too many times did my outfielder throw to the shortstop before hurling it to the catcher, while the announcer proudly proclaimed that my pitcher had not only caught the ball from the outfielder, but had then quickly tossed it back to himself! (Example: Jones... to... Maddux... to... Maddux... Out!). I was reminded more than once of the novel yet glitchy early days of MLBPA Sports Talk Baseball from years ago. Almost a decade has passed since that game saw the light of day, and is all we have to show for it?  Just like the older versions of WSB from seasons past, the pitching model follows a simple yet effective double button set-up. First you must press a certain direction on the analog pad that corresponds to a certain type of pitch. Then, after doing so you press the ~A~ button until the desired amount of power behind the throw has been accomplished via the colored moving bar. Once this has been done, the ball is hurled towards the batter with a path that can be slightly altered with a quick push on the analog stick. Easy and straight forward, getting the ball to home plate isn't a problem.  The only aspect of the simplicity that concerns me is the pitch selection. Before 2K1 came along there was a box that informed you of what throw is what in the appropriate direction. It would simply read ~down~ for a fastball, ~up~ for a curveball, ~left~ for a screwball, and so on and so forth. This time around however, you're treated to the arrows themselves with no clue as to what direction does what. The only real way to determine what kind of a pitch you're throwing is to check the manual and find out that way. While not a big deal to some, I don't see why it wasn't included as part of the engine in the first place (after all, it was in every previous incarnation of WSB up until now).  Sega opted to take the simple approach with the batting styles as well. Canning the multi-swing engine from earlier years (a model that gave the batter four types of swings: power, contact, normal, and bunt), we are now presented with a straight forward ~swing and hit it~ approach. Relying on the statistical characteristics of each player, the chances of a nubber, a double, and a home run are all calculated on the fly without any worry of choosing the proper bat style. While the strategy may diminish a bit with the lack of a swing-type, its affect on the season statistics of your players are much more accurate than they used to be. Mike Piazza who hit .483, had 93 HR, and 344 RBI's in my World Series Baseball '98 campaign can now look forward to the more realistic .342 AVG., 41 Bombs, and 135 RBI's. A much better representation of his real life skills than the Herculean numbers of before.  Another new touch to hitting is the way in which it is handled with the controller. Instead of pressing the obligatory ~A~ button whenever the ball gets close enough, you must now hold down the right trigger button and release it at the proper time to make contact. Press the left trigger button should you want to bunt, and press the other buttons should you want to do nothing. Not as intuitive as other baseball games we've been playing over the last twenty some years sure, but give it some time and you might grow to appreciate the new layout. I know I did.  Alas, when we get to the running game we have a much sadder story. Already hampered by the aforementioned slowdown when trying to swipe a base or take home plate, actually moving from corner to corner is a massive chore. Often unresponsive when trying to run back to your original base during a surprise catch or faltered steal, frequent double and triple plays are the ultimate result. Seemingly sprinting with a mind all its own, truly controlling your base runners is a task more suited to the psychic and meta-humans from super hero lore.  What's really annoying is what your runners do whenever a pop fly has been hit.  The computer controlled idiots take off for the next base whenever the ball has been contacted, no matter what the situation.  By the time you can finally gain control of these Olympians in the making, they've already been thrown out multiple times. What's more is that it seems that the opposing teams runners are always faster and smarter than your guys, beating throws and small line drives at what appears to be twice the pace of your team!  And that's not the worst feature of World Series Baseball.  That honor goes to the fielding model. Abolishing any option that would allow you to control the players yourself, the computer dominated fielders are straight out of the Keystone Capers. Not only do they leap and jump the wrong way with regularity, but the formations you can choose from don't seem to make a difference in the least. The illusion of being able to adjust to situational hitting scenarios is shattered when you realize that it's just that, an illusion.  Another problem with the fielding is attributed to the lack of a ball shadow. In just about every baseball game out there, the orb casts a dark silhouette on the ground so that you can track its movement. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. More often than not, you'll think you just blasted a homer out of left field or dropped a looper into the holes for extra bases only to be robbed of the glory seemingly out of nowhere. Following the actions of a typical game can prove trying without the appropriate arsenal of four-letter expletives... believe me, you'll need them.  It doesn't stop there. As not only are the above troubles rampant with fielding, but so too is that which I like to call the ~Two-Outs and You're Dead!~ clause. You see, up until you manage to pitch your way to two outs, regardless of the difficulty setting, the opposing team doesn't stand a chance against you. Strike out your first two batters, get them to pop out, whatever... but once you have two outs, watch yourself! It is at this moment that your fieldsman go bananas, and find it impossible to stop, block, or trap anything. What would normally be a tight pitcher's duel can quickly turn into a 19-4 blow out all because your team of gold glovers forget what the word ~catch~ means. Can you say ~poor A.I.~ class?  Looking at the larger picture, there's a lot to admire about World Series Baseball 2K1, and there's a lot to despise. Terrific recreations of Major League stadiums, player mannerisms, and a simple (but fun) play system can for the most part make your experience a worthy one. But if you expose the horrendous fielding engine for what it is, subject yourself to the constant visual chop in the infield, and listen to the amateur-level commentary, your positive game session can quickly turn into a frustrating one. A hit and miss title in various categories across the board, Sega Sports needs to think about keeping WSB in the minors for another year before finally bringing it up to the Big's.  -- Jeremy Dunham, Contributor, IGNDCJust ask Anoop or Brandon - for the past few weeks I've been pesteringthem on when Sega was finally going to send those guys a burn ofWorld Series Baseball 2K1. This is one of the games I've beenwaiting for since Day One...and when Anoop tossed the disc on my deskthe other day to give this version a test drive, I was already halfwayto the Dreamcast to give the game a full-on test drive.A brief history lesson - I started at IGN more than three years ago onthe now-defunct Saturnworld site...and one game I continuously playedwas World Series Baseball '98. Apart from Baseball Stars on the NES, WSB'98 was the finest baseball game around, kicking the stretchy pants ofeven the PlayStation and PC games that never made it to thebellyflopping system. The game had great pitching, batting, and fieldinginterfaces, and it was definitely a game to buy a Saturn system for.Shame no one did.That's why I was excited to finally pop in World Series Baseball2k1 into my Dreamcast.Quickly, my disappointment showed.The game is absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about it. Anoop yesterdaytalked about strange pixelations and other graphical oddities, but thoseare completely forgivable. On the graphics side, I will praise the absolutemeticulous attention to detail on the motion capturing. On the flipside,I'll slam the game for its poor quirks, where shadows turninto round circles when the camera pans above the field more than 20feet or so and shoulders become a weird disjointed mess on players in thedugout and in the field.  The spectators don't even show up in the stands onthe introductory fly-by. And the slowdown - ugh. Get a play at theplate and the game moves in horrible slow motion during and after theplay - it may be intentional, or it may be a bug in the programming. It'shard to tell. The batting and pitching are done very well, but without any gamedocumentation it's difficult to tell which pitch is which or to detect the presence of pitching and hitting hotspots like World Series Baseball '98. Itseems that the hotspots are in there, but I'll have to wait until the final, packagedcopy to be positive.Another downside: sound. Sega's top sound team was definitely not onthis product. Crowd sounds are scratchy and generic...especially the~booing~ when a bad play happens. The play-by-play is nice but kind ofjumpy compared to what was offered on NFL2K and NBA2K. But the worst part about the game - it's just hitting and pitching. Youhave no direct control over the fielders - all the fielding, other thanthrowing the ball to your choice of base, is done entirely by thecomputer. This is a spectator's baseball game - it's beautiful to watch,not so great to play. I think there's a great game engine here, but another few months isdefinitely needed to iron out the problems that World Series 2K1 has.Next year, I'm expecting an awesome version of World Series 2K2, but thegame right now needs a few more innings in the pen.", "date": "Jul 25, 2000"}
