Back when Hulk Hogan had his own cartoon, Cindy Lauper was involved, and Captain Lou Albano had rubber bands on his face. It was cartoony fun with larger than life characters. While everyone knows how fake wrestling is, it's still fun to catch once in a while on television. On your wireless device however, the fun ends quicker than a Batista championship run on Jeopardy.   Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 stars most of today's popular wrestlers. Everyone from John Cena to Tripe H to the Undertaker is ready to take on your challenge. You play as Default Wrestler ready to fight your way up the ladder until you face the Champion and try and win his belt. You have a choice between going for Raw or Smackdown's championship belt. While it's nice to be able to choose which brand you want to fight on, it really makes no difference since every wrestler in the game looks and acts exactly the same. This is all the more evident in the Customize mode, where you can create your own wrestler. You can change his face, boots, shirt style, etc. but in the end you have a wrestler with no name who ends up looking and performing like every wrestler in the game.    After choosing the brand you want to be on your quest for the gold begins. On Raw you fight Edge first making your way up to John Cena in a Hardcore Championship match. You can win by putting your opponent in submission holds, or by performing body slams and suplexes. If your opponent is on the ground, you can kick him or drop an elbow depending on your position. You can climb the turnbuckle and strike from above, or leave the ring and take the fight outside. Grappling is the most confusing out of the holds to master. Once you lock up, a bar appears with green, yellow and red sections. You have to try and keep the center line in the green area for three seconds to perform a body slam or suplex, but every time I tried it, it was hit and miss. Once your Momentum meter has filled, you can perform your finishing move and go for the pin. In between matches you can spend your points on upgrading your strength, grapple ability, durability, speed or charisma. I found the charisma upgrade to be quite funny since this is one game severely lacking in that department.   You can win matches one of two ways in this game. Perform body slams, try and win grapples and eventually beat your opponent with your awesome wrestling ability. Or you can do what I did. Stand right there and continually press the kick button until your opponent's health meter is depleted, you do your finisher, then pin him. I'm not kidding. It works against every wrestler I fought. I never even had to move to win a match until it was time to pin someone. I've reached a 41 hit combo by standing there as my opponent just kept walking into my kicks. I have had to retry matches on John Cena because for some reason after I depleted his health, he body slammed me twice and pinned me. You can try and get up from pins, but even if you've successfully gotten your shoulder up the wrestler still lays on top of you. Not exactly the most taxing A.I. in a video game.    The graphics aren't the most flattering either. Every wrestler looks like they belong in Lego Land. The music is forgettable and there are some weapons like chairs and trash cans lying around but there's no need to use them since the kick button magically works wonders. Sound effects are non existent and crowd noise is sporadic. After beating the entire Raw roster I unlocked the wrestlers I fought. Once I left the game and came back to it later I found those same wrestlers were locked again. Once I realized the game didn't save my progress half way through my Smackdown 'kick until they lose' run, I had no ambition to try and go for it again.   As I end my review, WWE Raw is playing on my TV. Sometimes I sit and watch it but games like this one remind me of why I've outgrown it. The larger than life characters are gone, replaced by guys that all look and act the same. Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 can only be recommended for the hardcore wrestling fan. For anyone else looking to spice up their action gaming category I recommend Chess. At least every match will be different.", "date": "Nov 16, 2007"}
