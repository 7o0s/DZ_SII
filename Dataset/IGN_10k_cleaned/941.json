Finding that special girl of your dreams in the local fun putt is one of them. Landing a cushy job as a videogame critic is another one. But if there is one outstanding surprise hiding in the shadows in all that life has to offer, it would have to be a complete copy of the elusive Dreamcast enigma, Rainbow Six.   Almost as bewildered by its arrival as anyone (although not quite as shocked as our fearless leader Brandon was when he picked it up on shipping day). I was eager to finally give the oft-discussed action/strategy title a whirl. Tearing into the glossy shrink-wrap enclosure and ripping a path straight to the plastic disc, my date with a stadium full of terrorists was fast approaching. Loaded into my faithful Dreamcast and a couple of moments into the opening FMV, my pilgrimage began...   Now let me warn you all from the beginning: Rainbow Six is not the type of game you can just jump into and play. The most complicated Dreamcast title to date, the control scheme is going to take some getting used too. With over 35 separate commands at your disposal, your joypad is going to get a serious workout. Take my advice, fair readers, study the manual thoroughly. And then, do it again. You never can be too prepared for this one.    To understand Tom Clancy's special ops sim, is to understand intelligence. While the game has plenty of action scenarios and missions, the key to beating them all lies in your ability to comprehend. Faced with multiple attack routes, traps, and other such factors, determining the proper method to defeat an assignment is usually more important than the objective itself. Make the wrong decision in the briefing room and you'll pay for your mistakes come combat time.   Each scenario blueprint can be assembled from any number of techniques. You can generalize your attack and go with the CPU's default action plan (which is a good idea in the early missions, but the kiss of death in latter ones) or create your own. Every meticulous detail from your team's formation to the weapons they carry to the clothes they wear can all be determined from headquarters. Should you choose to assign a squad of snipers in a contest against the terrorist group of sharpshooters, this is where you'll do it. Information-heavy to an extreme, every possible contingency can be discussed and calculated before heading out into action.   While this type of pre-battle planning may turn some of the casual action bunch into grumbling barbarians, it's this aspect of R6 that actually sets it apart from the rest of the crowd. Long exposed to mindless romps and pointless first-person gore-fest clones, the ability to actually think and THEN destroy puts a big ol' smile on my face. Fans of titles like Slave Zero (all three of you) need not apply.   Once you have chosen your attack formation, the equipment you need, and the soldiers you wish to command, it's off to the battlefield. Daunting at first, the previously-mentioned mammoth of a control set will test your frustration limit on more than one occasion. Hang in there, though, and after awhile you'll begin to adjust to the learning curve and appreciate the game's finer qualities. Almost ingenious in execution, you can switch to night-vision and contact your teammates, change weapons, and toggle view modes without ever having to leave the main screen. Every command can be input on the fly in the field of battle, furthering the illusion of real-life combat. There are no menu screens in the real world bucko!   Each mission is a suspenseful mini-drama from beginning to end. Seemingly removed from a Navy SEALs training film, the background stories, settings, and agendas are all carefully thought out and mirror many true-to-life scenarios our governments shadow men have to deal with every day. Sneaking behind buildings, climbing fire escapes, and rescuing hostages at the last moment only begin to describe the type of situations you can find prowling your GD-ROM's innermost depths.   Rich as Rainbow Six may be in realism, tactics, strategy, and depth, the game is not without its flaws. The most glaring omission of course is the obvious lack of multiplayer support. Delayed for more than eight months and pushed back more times than I'd like to count, the lost ability to play with or against friends is a seriously offending blow. A meager two-player mode is a missing ingredient that even the Nintendo 64 version managed to capture. Multiplayer was the popular aspect of the original PC installment and having zero options in that regard for Dreamcast really drives its ~must have~ quotient down.   Another rough spot would have to be the visuals and load times. Not an eye sore by any means, the authentic structures and atmosphere are marred by a true line of detail. Matter of factory in appearance, each building and character model may look good, but they don't look great. Perhaps a deeper approach to certain visual traits like blood stains and more convincing terrain damage would have made for a more complete package. Oh and those 60-second load times have got to go!Problems not withstanding, Rainbow Six is one of the deepest, most realistic games to inhabit the Dreamcast so far. Not perfect by any means, R6 is still an engaging jaunt into the realm of the government's special services. Would-be triggermen and aspiring battle tactitioners have a lot to look forward too, even if it is quite the lonely ride.", "date": "May 20, 2000"}
