The gameplay mechanics of urban planning, resource management, and crowd control are well known to strategy gamers.  In that sense, Anno 1701: Dawn of Discovery doesn't have much new to offer.  It plays like an 18th century version of SimCity, allowing history buffs to colonize the New World with their stylus.  The lack of innovation doesn't mean a lack of fun, though, and Anno offers -- with a few exceptions -- a thoroughly enjoyable strategy experience.   There was quite a bit going on back in 1701.  While each game starts out with a blank slate and lets you casually begin construction of your settlement, the society will soon spiral almost out of your control.  Requests for more food, more spices, more cotton come in from all areas of your town.  While you're working hard trying to appease one group of residents, the rest are complaining that they're being neglected.  On a very small scale, it gives the player some appreciation of how difficult a life of public service must be.     Where Anno stumbles is in its presentation and user interface.  Neither the game nor the manual do a suitable job of explaining all of the features and menus.  The result is things start to go wrong and you won't know how to fix them.  All you want to do is put clothes on the backs of your citizens but you can't figure out why your tailors aren't producing anything.  The game may suggest a way to fix your problem, but the advice doesn't always make sense.  Often, it will suggest a solution you've already implemented, leaving you scratching your head about just what the problem is.  You'll also find yourself completing objectives in Story Mode without any acknowledgement from the game, leaving you aimlessly waiting for your next objective.   Of course, many of the aspects of the game that aren't explained will be figured out in time.  But a good amount of frustration could have been avoided if the developers had taken the time to really teach people how to play the game.  After spending many hours with Anno 1701, there are still problems I run into that I don't know how to fix.   In spite of the above criticisms, the game is still fun.  It has a vibrant, colorful look that boasts a considerable amount of detail, especially when you zoom into your village.  Stepping down from your high horse to see how the common folk live, you'll discover residents strolling along the streets, doctors making house calls, and wagons carrying goods to the warehouse.  Out in the forests, you'll see bears hunting for a meal, sheep dogs tending to the flock, and lumberjacks chopping down trees.  It's all very charming.  The one downside to the visuals is you cannot change the camera angle, so sometimes it can be difficult placing a road or building behind another structure.   The music is great, with tunes that change to match the mood of your people.  For the most part, laying roads and constructing buildings with your stylus work well.  The needs of the citizenry are never more than a tap away.  There are some sliders used for adjusting things like taxes, though, that are too sensitive for precise stylus control.  But it's impressive that a good amount of depth has been squeezed into a portable game with just one method of input.  There is quite a variety of structures to be built, over 50 in all.    If you are successful in meeting the needs of the people, you'll see the civilization advance on its own.  Houses will upgrade to mansions, and citizens will improve their economic status from peasants to merchants to aristocrats.  Watching your settlement flourish is very satisfying.Anno 1701 offers a rich, portable strategy experience.  It rests comfortably on well-worn games and gameplay mechanics, but fans of the genre should find what they're looking for.  Establishing the New World can be frustrating because of a lack of explanation for certain features, but the perks -- great graphics, great sound, and deep gameplay -- make up for the shortcomings.", "date": "Mar 24, 2008"}
