Lemme check my green gear before heading down to the multiplex.  Rubber Hulk hands?  Check.  Hulk action figure?  Check.  Hulk lunchbox?  Check.  Hulk t-shirt?  Check.  Cheap cash-in cellphone game that manages to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie as well as no action whatsoever?  Check.   Features: Raging puzzle game action!  What's the first genre that comes to mind when you read the title Fury of the Hulk?  Puzzler, right?  Puzzler where you match up same-colored blocks to clear a board, yeah?  Hardly.  But that's what Universal, in a botched boneheaded move, greenlit for Moviso to develop for your handset: a puzzle game where you move a disembodied Hulk fist over a boring field of multi-hued blocks.  You see, the Hulk is surrounded by military vehicles, and only by matching up pairs and triples of like-vehicles can he escape.  So, technically, the Hulk smashes tanks in this game, but they're not tanks furiously chasing after you or shooting at you, like in the movie.  These are tanks encased in blocks that can only be smashed if they're next to another tank block.  Big fun!  As you wipe out a match, the blocks around it fall into place, hopefully creating more matches, since the Hulk is penalized for having a bunch of unconnected single blocks laying around at the end of the game.  And you don't want to penalize the Hulk now, do you?  Actually, it's really you that are penalized.  Not only are you penalized three bucks for downloading this insulting cash-in, but your intelligence is also sharply assaulted.  Who over at Universal actually thought this would be a great reward for the fans?  It's nothing more than a slap in the face, a movie tie-in that somehow manages to be cosmically worse than the grade-Z crapola Ocean and Acclaim used to push on unsuspected gamers.  The only temper you're gonna have to watch is your own, so as not to throw your phone against the nearest hard, flat surface.When I DL'd Fury of the Hulk, I had no idea what kind of game I was getting.  I guess the whole ~Fury~ thing threw me off the scent, but trust me, I can now smell this game from a mile away.  And it smells like something the Gamma hounds would deposit on Bruce Banner's lawn.  There's really no more to say other than: HULK SUCKS!", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
