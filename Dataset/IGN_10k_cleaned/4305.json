{"name": "Gotcha Force", "name_review": "Gotcha Force", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/06/gotcha-force-2", "text": "Lost in the shuffle of higher profile Capcom games, Gotcha Force is the exclusive GameCube title few have heard of -- and remains a mystery to most besides for the fact that it's a brightly colored fighter. Gotcha Force is designed especially for kids (the producer feels that publishers are focusing entirely on the mature audience and have overlooked kids). Although a lot of care has gone into making it appeal to kids, the true test is whether there's more to this brightly colored, chaotic fighting filled game than simple button mashing.   The Facts  Pokemon meets Powerstone in a blend of fighting and collecting genres  Create you own fighting forces with over 100 unique characters  Use your Gotcha Force editing skills to create a team that will crush your opposition   Play through story, challenge, and versus modes.  Gameplay   Gotcha Force isn't the easiest game to describe. It borrows elements from Pokemon and Powerstone to create a chaotic collecting/fighter hybrid. While this may seem like an odd proposition, it actually works really well with the title because it adds an element of strategy to an otherwise simple game.     Unlike preview builds of Gotcha Force, there aren't any preassembled Gotcha Forces (fighting squads) unlocked when you boot up the final version for the first time. This means, unless you only want to fight with your only default Borg, G Red, you'll have limited (or no) success in the Challenge and Versus modes. You'll have to play the story mode extensively to unlock enough characters to enjoy the game's other merits.    The story focuses around a boy named Kou, who happens to stumble upon a Borg (aliens that look like action figures) while on a school field trip. This pint sized warrior has landed on Earth because he doesn't want it to face the same fate as his home planet, Mega Borg. For some reason, the maniacal Galactic Emperor and his Death Force legion have their hearts set on destroying planets. It's now up to this unlikely partnership of boy (Kou) and Borg (G Red) to save the Earth. Along the way, he'll join up with other kids who have also been elected Gotcha Force Commanders by other Borg -- Gotcha Force is all about kids saving the day instead of adults (sticking with its kid-centric focus).   The general premise of the story mode is that you have to defend your hometown, Safaritown, from the invading Death Force. Your town is broken up into several different districts (each hosts multiple, self contained missions). After completing the designated amount of stages you'll have to partake in a boss battle before continuing your clean up of Safaritown. The individual districts basically serve as themed arenas for battles (like the school yard or your room) and are continually reused throughout story mode, with varying battle requirements.    The first couple missions are simple, eliminate pushover Death Force units. These missions are there to get you used to playing the game and level up G Red (Borgs gain experience from battles). After a few successful battles, things become slightly more interesting. Mission objectives range from eliminate all the Death Force, protect a friend, battle a rival Gotcha Force Commander, train with your allies, or boss battles. Although the objectives are technically different, all missions feel really similar. You're still just trying to destroy all the enemies -- the only variant is in the strength and number of your opponents. It's a lot of the same thing, which does get pretty tedious. After an hour or so of the story mode, you'll probably have had quite enough of it, especially since the story is delivered in very small snippets and isn't all that interesting. Basically, story mode is simply how you unlock Borgs and level up your Gotcha Forces -- otherwise it isn't really worth your time.   With each successful mission, you'll gain both Gotcha Force Energy (essentially currency) and data bits on the Borgs you fight. If you collect enough data on a certain Borg, you'll be able to replicate it for your own collection. Your warehouse full of Borg (there are about 200 in total) can then be used to assemble the ultimate fighting force (the strategic element of this game). Instead of only playing as one Borg, you have an entire squad at your command (the number depends on your GF Energy). If your character dies, the match isn't necessarily over. He'll be replaced by the next Borg in your queue. You keep fighting until your entire force is spent.    Each force can hold up to 30 Borgs, but you have to have enough GF energy to use them in battle (each Borg has an associated cost). It really does matter how you assemble your forces. Depending on your play preferences and the types of enemies you're facing, you're going to want to arrange your force differently -- but your Force will almost always be different from your friends. As you create your force, you'll learn if it's better to have all fast and weak characters, strong and slow, or a mixture of the two.  Also, each character has its own advantages in terms of attacks. Some Borgs have devastating homing barrages, whereas other Borgs can lock down enemies or set waypoints for quick transport. For a game with such a simple battle system there's a lot to consider. Since you can have ten Gotcha Forces, there's room to experiment -- and building a kick arse force is a rewarding.    The actual combat is fast paced and hectic. If you've ramped up the difficulty or are playing against a skilled opponent -- it can be difficult to even tell what is going on amidst the chaos. The controls are very simple, and once you've played around with them you realize they work really well for this type of game. Each Borg has a normal attack, ranged attack, and special move. These can't be used continuously (except for the attack), so you'll have to wait for your weapons to recharge. Combat is also aided by a simple lock-on system that keeps you targeted on the same Borg until you destroy it or manually switch (since things get confusing).    In terms of defense, your Borg can dash out of the way of attacks by tapping on the control stick. A warning will appear on your screen telling you the direction of the attack, which keeps kids from getting completely battered. The only real problem with the fighting is that the camera is wonky. It likes to place some form of obstacle between you and your Borg or if you're fighting a flying opponent, the camera angle is through your Borg's feet -- which gets a bit annoying.   The real time to demonstrate your combat skills, although the game isn't too difficult to master, is during Versus battle. Here you can play with up to three other people in teams of two. You simply pick one of your Force's to play as and duke it out on the battlefield. It's not all that different from fighting in story mode except that you're fighting against an actual person, who provides a much more rewarding and fun experience since the AI usually isn't too aggressive.    The final mode in Gotcha Force is Challenge. This has you play through a four stage set of consecutive battles, which ends with a boss fight. This is actually one of the more enjoyable modes because it does feel like a challenge. This can also be tackled in co-op (team up with a friend to beat the challenge).   Gotcha Force is a decent game. It can be fun, especially when playing with friends, and the collecting and Force building elements add depth to an otherwise shallow game. There probably isn't enough variety in gameplay, challenge, or depth in controls to satisfy older gamers, but the younger crowd will probably get a kick out of it since the game has so many kid friendly elements and is really easy to pick up and play.    Graphics  The graphics are rather mixed. The Borgs are fairly detailed and colorful -- just what you'd expect from a set of action figures. They also animate fluidly -- whether they're dashing and shooting or rolling out of the way. However, all battles take place on a rather bland square arena. Colors are usually drab and details very basic. Textures are stretched, and even though it's a simple, colorful design -- it doesn't look that good. Also, once you get to the edge of the arena, all you see is a cloudy colored backdrop. Granted, you aren't supposed to be focusing on the environments, it's still an eyesore.    What really hurts Gotcha Force, and is its biggest fault, is the camera. It is so spastic that it's bound to cause confusion and frustration for kids. Since you're always locked on an enemy, the camera will occasionally whip around to an odd and disorienting angle to try and follow both of your movements. If you're near the edge of the arena, it will usually only show you and the edge instead of the rest of the battlefield. Other habits, like angling the action through your Borg's feet or inserting objects between you and your Borg.   Sound  Sound is also lacks excitement. There is a musical score in the background of fights that is full of fast paced, campy music that keeps the pace of the game moving. It's nothing special or to catchy, but it works with the game. The sound effects are also your standard arsenal of dashing, shooting, and hitting noises. What's truly unacceptable is that there isn't any voice acting during the story mode. Instead, you're stuck reading thought bubbles while you hear, ~hey!~ or other Pokemon styled noises. However, G Red will occasionally throw out one liners while he's fighting, but none of the other Borgs do.  I found Gotcha Force to be pretty intriguing -- for the first 20 minutes I played it. But, once you make sense of the madness on screen, it loses some its bizarre charm. What really hurts it is that the game never progresses beyond the simple battles. I never felt challenged -- and after playing through the story mode for an hour, I felt like I had seen all there was to see. However, I was forced to trudge forward for seemingly endless hours through all too similar battles just so I could unlock Borgs for my Gotcha Force.The collecting elements, all though not all that complicated, adds some much needed depth (although not that deep) to the game. It at least gives you motivation to play it, because that way you'll be prepared to take on friends in multiplayer mode. Gotcha Force is a kid's title, and I think the concept is a good one. I think kids would look past the monotony and enjoy the pure fighting. However, where Gotcha Force falters is with the disorienting camera -- it will frustrate the audience the game's trying to capture. Gotcha Force is a worthy effort for expanding the children library, but it should probably be rented first to make sure gamers (young or old) will be happy with it in the long run.", "date": "Dec 6, 2003"}
