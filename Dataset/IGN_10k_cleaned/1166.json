Featuring digitized characters resembling          Mortal Kombat, but now in 3-D and with          basically the same gameplay, War Gods          hopes to draw in the same group of fans          that made Mortal Kombat such a hit. Unfortunately, War Gods has too many strikes against it to live up to the precedents set by its predecessors.   War Gods has chosen to try out the proven MK formula in 3D, and while this is an admirable notion, the execution is seriously flawed. Williams has chosen to stick with digitized characters instead of polygonal ones which lend themselves better to the 3D environment. Because of this, it becomes confusing when the characters get too close to each other. In addition, the 3D side-step happens too slowly to be effective.  AI is tantamount to a fighting game's success, and War Gods fails here as well. The first two matches are easy as pie, and then it quickly jumps to the other end of the spectrum. There's no real in-between.   Finally, War Gods is pretty much a straight port of the arcade, with no extras at all. Ultimately, if you liked the arcade game, you may enjoy this port. However, for the rest of us who like our fighters challenging and strong, stay away. War Gods was a good idea that went sour with flawed character design and choppy animation derivitive of its core. That said, it should be noted that developer Eurocom managed an excellent port of the game to Nintendo 64. It's just too bad that there wasn't much there to begin with. Unless you loved Mortal Kombat and don't mind a few uninspired characters to play around with, we recommend waiting.", "date": "May 24, 1997"}
