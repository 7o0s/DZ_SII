It gives people something to do when they should be working. There's no need to manually reshuffle cards and you can't generally cheat (so any victory you earn playing by yourself is earned). Best of all, it's free. All the reasons solitaire works on a PC are the same reasons it fails on Xbox Live Arcade. You have to play on a TV, which isn't very convenient if you are trying to be sneaky at work. And it's not free. In fact, it costs 800 Microsoft Points (US$10). I haven't felt this screwed since I dropped my soap in the IGN shower room.  If you're a fan of playing by yourself, Soltrio Solitaire has a decent amount of lonesome games to keep you busy. There are 16 variations of solitaire, which is far fewer than what you'll get by purchasing a $5 book of solitaire games and a cheap deck of cards for a buck. Though, to be fair, a deck of cards doesn't come with a renaissance fair soundtrack.  Soltrio Solitaire List of Games3 Shuffles and a Draw Aces Up Archway Backbone Easthaven Forty Thieves Freecell Easy/Normal Grandfather's Clock Klondike Easy/Deal 3 Matrimony Memory Montana Sea Towers Spider 1 Suit Super Flower Garden ZodiacSoltrio Solitaire includes the most popular solo card games, but some also feel like unnecessary padding. Memory is included as a solo game. This is a game where you pick cards until you find pairs, continuing along until are cards are revealed. The only person who can't beat Memory alone is the guy from Memento. Oddly enough, this is a single-player only experience, though Memory has always been a game for two people.  If playing by yourself isn't enough motivation to get you playing Soltrio Solitaire 24/7 there are two additions that may help. There's a ~quest~ mode, which has you beating solitaire games to unlock new deck skins, and online play. The quest mode is pretty worthless and online play isn't much better.  Just like the real thing, but without the threat of papercuts. Multiplayer offers a Klondike variation that can be played either cooperatively or competitively. Don't even bother with the cooperative mode. It's sloppy and no fun at all. Part of the point of solitaire is that it puts you in a Zen-like state of mind. That doesn't happen when trying to coordinate with a partner to lay down cards.  The competitive mode -- which has players battling to clear their slush pile first -- can be spirited and fun. Though the battles are often short, they are also sometimes sweet. With vision camera support, solitaire players can, for the first time, make a love connection. For once, playing with yourself can help you make new friends. The competitive game itself isn't as good as a true two-player card game such as Speed, but it's serviceable. However, for $10, serviceable just doesn't cut it. Soltrio Solitaire might be worth $5, but it's definitely not worth the $10 currently being charged. It's unjustified. There's no licensing fee to pay for using solitaire games; no expensive game engine that costs millions to build; and no marketing costs. Soltrio Solitaire is a rip off. It's that simple. It's overpriced and it under-delivers. The single-player games are nicely presented and the online multiplayer is decent, but it's just not enough to validate the high price point. Avoid this one at all costs.", "date": "May 21, 2007"}
