Pulling out the old Atari 2600 and popping in Pac-Man or Yar's Revenge is about as good a time as I'm going to have. Thankfully, Midway understands my needs, and has supplied me with Arcade's Greatest Hits the Midway Collection 2 (damn that's a long name).         While most of the real classics (Defender,         Robotron, Joust) appeared on the first         Arcade's Greatest Hits collection, number         two has its fair share of winners too.   High on         the list of cool games is Moon Patrol, a game actually         developed in Japan. It may not look like         much now, but at the time the combination of         jumping and shooting made for one addicting         game. And let's not forget that great music.         Burger Time also makes an appearance, a top         game that was also featured on the         Intellivision.          The one game that will probably drive retro         freaks to stores in droves is Spy Hunter, the         classic top-down driver/shooter. Even the         light-up weapons signs are here, albeit in         sprite form. And, while it may not drive sales         like Spy Hunter, Root Beer Tapper deserves         a mention for its novelty value.         Unfortunately, there's no tap peripheral.          The real value in Midway Collection 2,         though, lies in the inclusion of three         extremely rare Williams games, Joust 2,         Blaster, and Splat. Eugene Jarvis fans will         adore Blaster, as it's not only the first 3D         first-person shooter, but it's also a pretty fun         game. Joust 2 is a must-see as well, and         Splat is just, well, weird.          Finally, Midway has included a tough, yet         informative trivia game, complete with video         clips of the game creators themselves         explaining the answers. This alone is worth         checking out if you're at all interested in retro-gaming.   Retro-gaming isn't for everyone. But for those of us who spent all our weekends and free times in darkly lit pizza joints and arcades, collections like this are worth their weight in gold.
