The trials and tribulations of Jill the baker have inspired over 30 million downloads. So, you can imagine how this caught the eye of RealNetworks, who scooped up the mobile rights and set about a cellphone translation. But replacing a mouse with a directional pad isn't always as sweet as buttercream frosting, so will this edition of Cake Mania continue to drive traffic to Jill's bakery? Or is this no ace of cakes?   Cake Mania occupies the ~plate spinning~ sub-genre of puzzle games. Like Diner Dash, the goal is to manage time and resources under increasingly difficult conditions. How long can you keep everything up in the air? Because the first time one thing comes crashing to the ground, your confidence is rattled and it's a struggle to find the groove again. In Cake Mania, baking the wrong-shaped cake or getting stuck with an unfinished cake in your hands and nowhere to put it can skip the groove. On many occasions, I found that it's much easier to recover from an early mistake. If the counter is full of customers and my cupcakes aren't done to assuage their impatience, botching a frosting choice is tantamount to disaster.   In other words, Cake Mania can be incredibly stressful.   But it's a fun stressful, because as I mentioned, there is a groove you often find yourself in -- and it's a rather entertaining place to be. Customer sidle up to the counter and demand some cake creation. Chocolate round with purple frosting and a rose decoration? Two-layer with red icing? When you're in that zone it's no sweat.   Jill's bakeries -- and there are four of them you open throughout the 48-stage game -- come with basic equipment: counter, oven, frosting station. The formula is pretty straightforward. You hand the customer a menu, they tell you what they want, and you head for the oven to bake the proper shape of cake. As you rack up sales, you add equipment to the kitchen for managing increased traffic. More ovens. Faster frosting stations. Extra cake decorations. And to keep the waiting folks amused, you can let them sample cupcakes or watch television. Jill can even splurge on some new kicks that keep her racing around the kitchen without sweating in the cake mix. Eeew.   Perhaps the most important thing you can buy, though, is a platter. You can place a cake is any stage of creation on the platter so you can attend to other business. Jill only has two hands, so if you still have some cakes over at the frosting station, but you see that an oven has just opened up, you can temporarily store a work-in-progress. If you grab a freshly baked cake but don't have a platter or any room at your frosting stations, you have to dump the cake. Dumping the cake for any reason -- mistaken frosting or accidental baking -- costs you money. And that cuts into your monthly take.   As something of a Cake Mania fan on the PC (I like these ~spinning plate~ games), I was concerned about going from mouse controls to a cursor controlled with the d-pad. It's not the most elegant solution, but with so many stations and customer spots in the bakery, there was no way to assign everything to a number key like Diner Dash. To alleviate time lost by clicking a cursor, you can wraparound the bakery by pressing against a ~wall.~ the cursor appears on the opposite side of the bakery. This provides a huge shortcut between ovens and icing, cupcakes and customers. This simple design choice makes all the difference in the world.   Cake Mania is dressed up with some bright, colorful graphics that look like mobile-fied versions of the original PC sprites. The different themed kitchens and seasonal customers (Dracula shows up in October, for example) give the game a nice bit of personality.  Cake Mania is a casual PC-to-mobile success story, just like Diner Dash. The spirit of the game survives the transition fully intact, the new control scheme keeps the game extremely playable, and the visuals are accurate approximations of those found in the PC game. This game is quite frantic, though, and I know that the level of stress it induces is not every gamer's bag. However, there is real reward in hitting your strike and blazing through a level with no mistakes while raking in maximum tips for exemplary service. Fans of the original should download it for cake-making fun on the go, while newcomers should see for themselves why Cake Mania earned over 30 million downloads in the first place.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
