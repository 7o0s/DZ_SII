Games like X-Men Legends should do much to put the handheld game deck back on solid footing as well as silence some detractors. This is an excellent port of a popular console titles -- and even more so, it's a port of console title you would actually want to play.   X-Men Legends is an adventure game that puts you in command of a four-mutant team. You can switch out teammates while playing a through a lengthy plot involving Magneto (who else?) and a novice X-Men recruit, Alison Crestmere (aka Magma). Controllable characters include the likes of Wolverine and Cyclops, so all of the popular mutants are covered.   The majority of the game is spent fighting off hordes of thugs and guards -- which are quite plentiful. Sometimes they will attack you in manageable pairs, other times the screen seems overrun with bad guys. Fortunately, you have your mutant powers and a host of special items to help you out in a pinch like this. The menu system for selecting usable items and mutant powers is easy to navigate.   Since you are in control of four X-Men, you must rely on the AI to manage the three mutant you are not directly pulling the strings on. This is sometimes frustrating, as, well, the computer doesn't always make the choices you wish it would. For example, you might wish to heal before you fall before Magneto's might. The AI may see it another way.   In addition to fighting, there is a good amount of item collecting and skill building, lending X-Men Legends some serious RPG mechanics. As you mow down bad guys, break open objects, and check through doors, you'll uncover equipment upgrades that will help you overpower the ever-increasing strength of Magneto's forces.   As a single-player game, X-Men Legends is good. But as a multiplayer game, it's great. X-Men Legends supports Bluetooth for multiplayer sessions, and it's the best way to play. You can discuss what to do with nearby players and come to a consensus on what to do, where to go, and how to fight. And chances are, your human friends actually know when to heal.   Even though the game mechanics are solid, perhaps the most stunning aspects of X-Men Legends are the production values. Developer Barking Lizards certainly has the N-Gage dialed in, assembling a game that capitalizes on the promise that Nokia delivered well over a year ago. On consoles, X-Men Legends was pure polygons with some excellent celshading techniques to make the game look like a true comic book come to life. X-Men Legends employs sprites rather than polys, but considering some of the difficulties the platform has moving a significant amount of geometry, the change is welcome. And not in the least bit detracting.   Hand-drawn sprites actually allow Barking Lizard to craft some smooth animations for each of the characters. Many of your garden variety enemies don't get the same lush treatment, but since they don't remain on-screen for terribly long, perhaps the attention is better received on the leads. The locations, straight from the console title, are solid recreations.   What will really surprise you, though, is the amount of FMV and voice that are crammed into this tiny MMC. The number of video cutscenes aren't legendary, but they are used wisely to forward the plot and we were pleased to see that even though they are low-res, they don't look as grainy as we feared they might. Think good WMV streams and you'll get the idea. X-Men Legends includes reams of spoken script (including voice work from Patrick Stewart as Professor X) and all the voices, despite sounding a little tinny from compression routines, are easily heard. The sound effects are also good, but they seem to have come at the expense of background music, which is not as plentiful.  First SSX, then King of Fighters, now X-Men Legends. I wish these were the kind of games the N-Gage launched with, because the gaming journos that love to hack on the system would have little to gnash over. This is a breakthrough title for the system, proving that it cannot only recreate console games cleverly (as long as the right developer is working on it), but it can offer very compelling to-go gaming on par with the best of the GBA and DS. If you own an N-Gage, this is definitely your next purchase.", "date": "Feb 14, 2005"}
